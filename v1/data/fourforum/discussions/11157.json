   "In the past, homosexuals have always called for \"tolerance\" and \"privacy,\" but today they flaunt their perversion in public parades, \"gay\" television shows and Hollywood movies. Demanding laws for same-sex \"marriages\" and \"hate crimes\" legislation, they would require Christians and everyone else to recognize and never question their immoral lifestyle.\n \n Now homosexual advocates are moving to mandate their agenda of calling evil good by court orders and government regulation. Two recent examples bear witness.\n \n Last month in Scottsboro, Ala., two lesbian teenagers decided they wanted to attend the high school junior-senior prom as a couple. When the superintendent, Dr. Judith Berry, informed the students that they could not attend the prom together, the students' parents hired a lawyer to intervene. Jackson County Circuit Court Judge John Graham issued a last-minute order prohibiting the Board from barring the girls from the prom. One girl, a 17-year-old senior, wore a dress while the other, a 16-year-old junior, dressed in a tuxedo.\n \n Their attorney, Parker Edmiston, casually dismissed any concerns that school officials or parents had about the lesbian couple attending the prom by saying, \"This is just a dance. Adults need not get involved.\" Of course, the problem here is that adults - the attorney and judge - did get involved.\n \n Attorney Edmiston not only exhibited hypocrisy but also helped set a precedent for mandating acceptance of homosexuality in the public school system. Pushing aside the right of elected school officials to regulate school functions, the court summarily disregarded the rights of parents and other students who depend on school officials to maintain moral standards. Intent on normalizing deviant behavior, the courts have once again imposed an immoral standard upon an unwilling community.\n \n Just this past week, in another example of moral intolerance, Elane Photography, a family-owned photography business in Albuquerque, N.M., was ordered to pay $6,637.94 in attorney's fees and costs to a lesbian for refusing to photograph her same-sex \"commitment ceremony.\" After a one-day trial in January, the New Mexico Human Rights Commission found co-owners Elaine and Jon Huguenin guilty of \"sexual orientation\" discrimination when they did not do business in a manner that would have violated their Christian beliefs, despite the fact that under the law in New Mexico same-sex \"marriages\" and civil unions are not legal. Under such an oppressive nondiscrimination policy, would Elane Photography be forced to photograph a \"commitment ceremony\" between a man and his son, or between two sisters, or between a man and his three brides?\n \n New Mexico is in essence demanding that small-business owners be forced to work against their will. As the Huguenins' attorney said, \"The government cannot make people choose between their faith and their livelihood,\" but that is exactly what the New Mexico Human Rights Commission is doing.\n \n The role of government is to protect an individual in the enjoyment of those unalienable rights of life, liberty and property given by God. One's liberty, therefore, cannot be taken without due process of law under the Fifth and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution. Sir William Blackstone defined \"natural liberty\" in the law prior to the drafting of the Constitution as follows:a power of acting as one thinks fit, without any restraint or control, unless by the law of nature: being a right inherent in us by birth, and one of the gifts of God to man at his creation.When the law of nature and the law of God are ignored and made inapplicable to man's moral behavior, all limits on the concept of liberty are removed, resulting in mere license or licentiousness. James Wilson, an original Supreme Court Justice and signer of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, explained it this way:Without liberty, law loses its nature and its name, and becomes oppression. Without law, liberty also loses its nature and its name, and becomes licentiousness.Where law is warped to require a distorted view of liberty, licentiousness becomes court-ordered, as it did at Scottsboro High School. Judges, legislators and civil officers who believe that they must be \"fair\" to immoral conduct do not understand that without moral boundaries in the law, there is no true liberty, as Elane Photography will tell you. Whether in Alabama or New Mexico, the radical homosexual agenda must not be allowed to put the force of law behind its oppressive intolerance of Christianity and the moral law.\n The intolerance of the homosexual agenda\n\n \n In reading this article, I find such gross LEGAL CONCEPTUAL errors that I am amazed this guy wasn't kicked off the bench for not having a clue about what he was supposed to enforce...",

Pushing aside the right of elected school officials to regulate school functions, the court summarily disregarded the rights of parents and other students who depend on school officials to maintain moral standards. Intent on normalizing deviant behavior, the courts have once again imposed an immoral standard upon an unwilling community.\n\n 1) It is a routine propagandic ploy to pretend that not allowing discrimination is somehow \"mandating acceptance\".\n By that logic, we \"accept\" Britney's previous hours long marriage.\n We \"accept\" people who are on their fifth or sixth divorce.\n We \"accept\" Satanism when we don't discriminate against it.\n \n I reject such a ridiculous notion that NOT discriminating against something automatically means it is \"accepted\".\n \n 2) \"maintain moral standards\" in the school.\n Quite frankly, do we want our schools maintaining \"moral standards\"?\n Isn't that the job of the parent?\n \n Of course, the school NEEDS to maintain a level of civillity in order to ensure a learning environment is present. A purpose of ensuring the function of the school, instead of arbitrary claims of \"moral standards\".\n \n 3) What about when the shoe is on the other foot?\n \n There are communities where parents have decided on \"moral standards\" that are inconsistent with Moore's prejudice towards homosexuality.\n Like having a book on the school shelf that he doesn't approve of.\n \n Why is it then that \"the rights of parents and other students\" are ignored, while an individual parent, or a minority of parents, dictate policy for the rest of the school according to THEIR \"morality\" towards gays?\n \n It would appear that no matter what the case, Moore sides with the parents against gays having a right to put their will above others...\n \n \n \nJust this past week, in another example of moral intolerance, Elane Photography, a family-owned photography business in Albuquerque, N.M., was ordered to pay $6,637.94 in attorney's fees and costs to a lesbian for refusing to photograph her same-sex \"commitment ceremony.\" After a one-day trial in January, the New Mexico Human Rights Commission found co-owners Elaine and Jon Huguenin guilty of \"sexual orientation\" discrimination when they did not do business in a manner that would have violated their Christian beliefs, despite the fact that under the law in New Mexico same-sex \"marriages\" and civil unions are not legal. Under such an oppressive nondiscrimination policy, would Elane Photography be forced to photograph a \"commitment ceremony\" between a man and his son, or between two sisters, or between a man and his three brides?\n\n This is one (in addition to item #3 above) of those legal conceptual errors that Moore just doesn't seem to grasp.\n \n Suppose that the photographer didn't want to photograph an interracial couple because of his \"religion\". Would Moore support that?\n \n Or how about a photographer who didn't want to photograph a couple in a Lutheran church, because of the photographer's individual beliefs. Would Moore support that?\n \n In enforcing the law, a judge shouldn't introduce his own prejudice about the law. The fact that \"same-sex marriages and civil unions are not legal\" is irrelevant.\n The law states that sexual orientation discrimination, like religious or racial discrimination, is illegal.\n These laws were enacted to help ensure that people could no longer say \"I won't serve you because you're black\".\n \n Likewise, similar laws with typically identical wording are on the books in many places that prevent people from saying \"I won't serve you because you're gay\".\n \n The KKK has a ridiculously skewed view of their own brand of \"Khristianity\" (NOT consistent with the written dogma of Christianity, IMO and in many opinions) that they ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN. They have a RELIGIOUS BELIEF regarding discriminating against blacks.\n \n But we ignore their religious beliefs and say they can't.\n \n We can't have it both ways. Either it is legal for them to discriminate against blacks in accordance with their religion, or it is illegal for Christians to discriminate against gays in accordance with their CLAIMED religion.\n \n (And I state \"claimed\" because there is NOWHERE in the bible which mandates discrimination against gays. A consistent philosophy would hold that like discriminating against gays, christians would have to discriminate against ALL sins equally. But that would be bad for business, cause everybody is a sinner...)\n \n \n \nNew Mexico is in essence demanding that small-business owners be forced to work against their will. As the Huguenins' attorney said, \"The government cannot make people choose between their faith and their livelihood,\" but that is exactly what the New Mexico Human Rights Commission is doing.\n\n This same philosophy can be applied to Muslims, who don't want to wash their hands for surgery.\n \n But I'm sure Moore would only apply this to HIS chosen religion...",

The Bible doesn't speak down to the detail of specifics on many issues, but we can surmise the Bible doesn't really allow for it. It doesn't say you shouldn't drive a car recklessly either, but a person could certainly in part believe it's wrong from Christian moralistic views in the Bible. The Bible certainly does indicate that men and women are to be together rather than men and men, or women and women. And a VERY common and widely accepted understanding/interpretation of that Bible is that Paul as well as various passages in the OT indicate it's WRONG to have men/men or women/women relationships. I know that you know this too, because we've discussed it before, so I find it highly odd (and suspicious really) that you'd act as though the idea that someone saying they don't agree with gay marriage because of their religion is unsupportable or needs to be \"rationally evaluated.\" Heck, many threads here are an 'evaluation' of those ideas, so clearly it's a well-established view. It just so happens you don't agree with the interpretation because it doesn't fit what you think religion should be saying or not saying, so you embrace the interpretations that DON'T lead to objection toward gay marriage (like the oft-jumped-to temple prostitution idea for some of the passages in question). That's fine; you can interpret the Bible however you want, but don't act as though the common interpretation I'M talking about has no basis, or that it's NOT \"rationally evaluated.\" Many have rationally evaluated it and come to the conclusion that it indeed does NOT allow for the likes of gay marriage.\n \n \nIt's amusing to see your words play out a hint of truth, yet you can't make the connection.\n \"To force them to do a wedding...\" Is a wedding photographer PERFORMING a marriage?

Or maybe not. But the indication is that this photographer gave religious reasons for why he didn't want to do it. And if it is, you're forcing someone to go against their religion. So there you go. \n \n \n \n\"where it's truly harmful\"?\n ROFLMAO!\n Tell me Jyoshu.

But the idea of religion being behind people not agreeing with gay marriage is MUCH more accepted and widespread, and I disagree with you that bigotry (as opposed to religion) is what constitutes most cases of moralistic objection to gay marriage. In fact that's one reason I think the gay marriage issue is really different in many cases than the issue of blacks on the back of the bus and your other examples. The objections largely have ORIGINATED in religious views for the gay marriage issue. I don't think you can just blithely chalk it up to bigotry in so many cases--it really IS their religious convictions behind it in many cases. Probably MOST cases, IMO. It's kind of ironic really. On one hand people such as yourself will come right out and indicate or admit that most of the opposition against gays comes out of religion, at other times. Specifically Christianity, in the U.S. We've discussed that in other threads. But then in this thread you won't allow them to claim religion as the main reason for their objections--now \"bigotry is the common thread, NOT religion.\" emoticon_frazzled",

Or maybe not.\n\n You always get to that stage, don't you.\n Where you avoid discussing the question involved, and instead try to make it seem like both sides could be equally legitimate.\n Bigotry IS the reason, and you cannot bring yourself to accurately address the REAL REASONS (without misrepresentation) it has been pointed out as bigotry.\n \n \n \nBut the indication is that this photographer gave religious reasons for why he didn't want to do it. And if it is, you're forcing someone to go against their religion. So there you go.\n\n I don't know if you get it yet or not, but each time you try to resort to this lame \"he said it's so, so I won't question it\" mentality I will point to EXACTLY the sort of approach you are creating.\n And you can't counter it.\n And each time you fail to counter it, it's just that much more noticable.\n The mentality you are justifying would lead to: \"So if a Muslim doesn't want to wash his hands before a surgery because of his religion, then he should not be forced to it...\n If a KKKhristian marriage coordinator doesn't want to coordinate an interracial marriage because of his beliefs, then by this approach he should be allowed to discriminate.\"\n \n Quite frankly, these things ALREADY EXIST in today's society.\n We ALREADY FORCE people to go against their \"racist\" or \"religious\" ideals.\n \n So why is it that just the anti-gay bigots get the free pass?\n \n \n \nThose ARE harmful because they represent SEPARATE but equal or just flat out UNEQUAL, depending on the situation.\n\n My mind is reeling at how you could possibly say this, and not think it doesn't apply to the whole \"photographer refuses to take pictures of gay marrying couples\" thing.\n Or maybe you're just about to toss off this flimsy response, and completely side-step any justification at all.\n I suspect the latter...\n \n \n \nBut the idea of religion being behind people not agreeing with gay marriage is MUCH more accepted and widespread, and I disagree with you that bigotry (as opposed to religion) is what constitutes most cases of moralistic objection to gay marriage.\n\n WRONG!\n Not \"what constitutes most cases of moralistic objection\".\n I am talking about bigotry being the reason THEY REFUSE to do their job.\n If I take photos of a Christian wedding, does that make me Christian?\n Does that mean I \"support\" Christianity?\n NO.\n \n And it is THAT fact that you just can't seem to honestly address, or wrap your head around.\n The \"moralistic objection\" means that THEY THEMSELVES don't have gay sex, or engage in a gay relationship.\n Saying that it goes BEYOND that into the realm of \"I don't serve gay people\" demonstrates where bigotry exists.\n \n How many times am I going to have to repeat that before you honestly address it?\n \n \n \nIn fact that's one reason I think the gay marriage issue is really different in many cases than the issue of blacks on the back of the bus and your other examples. The objections largely have ORIGINATED in religious views for the gay marriage issue.\n\n I really can't believe you tried to go there.\n I can quote you PLENTY of \"religious views\", based in KKKhristianity, that demonstrate a RELIGIOUS reasoning for racial prejudice.\n It is JUST as religious.\n \n \n \nOn one hand people such as yourself will come right out and indicate or admit that most of the opposition against gays comes out of religion, at other times. Specifically Christianity, in the U.S. We've discussed that in other threads. But then in this thread you won't allow them to claim religion as the main reason for their objections--now \"bigotry is the common thread, NOT religion.\" emoticon_frazzled\n\n Sigh.\n And so the obfuscation continues... Merrily along...\n \n I admit that their \"objections\" are based in \"religion\".\n I do NOT agree that their REFUSAL to do their job is based in \"religion\".\n NOWHERE does it say \"Thou shalt not take pictures of a gay wedding\".\n You have pointed to NO intelligible correlation between bible interpretations and that view-point.\n \n Instead, you pull the trick of trying to show that \"we object to homosexuality\" somehow encompasses \"we don't perform services for gay people\".\n By that mentality, shouldn't you also NOT perform services for people who are atheist, work on the sabbaoth, swear, covet their neighbor's wife, etc, etc, etc?\n \n (And that's another argument that you keep ignoring, that just plain WILL NOT go away.)\n \n ===================================================\n \n Perhaps you can explain your view. An atheist believes there is no God. How does coordinating a wedding conflict with that belief? What about planning a wedding requires that he compromise that belief and say that there is a God?\n\n From my side, I see nothing but obfuscation and misdirection.\n So maybe \"step-by-step\" is the best approach, and I yield to your recognition of that.\n \n Jyoshu, if you want \"one\" question that I want answered, then address Kronus's point. (And before you go into predictable obfuscation mode, both questions are essentially asking the same thing.)",

As long as everyone is consenting, and that would be a crucial point, then they can hold whatever ceremony they like. Just tell me how many people will be in the family portrait so i can bring a big enough lens. As long as they aren't hurting anyone or breaking the law it isn't my job to judge or moralize, just to take pictures.\n\n \n Well, then maybe we just think differently on this. If it were a wedding (or anything else, really) that I strongly objected to moralistically, I probably wouldn't want to facilitate someone else doing it. That's not to say I'd try to PREVENT it happening, but that's not the same as the choice to participate. You yourself just gave an example of something that you'd be moralistically opposed to (in your case, on the basis that you feel it is harmful and against the law), and would balk on it, and so you too wouldn't want to facilitate that. \n \n \nHowever, I see what you're saying. Someone can invent their own moral code that says that helping such and such a type of person do such and such type of thing is wrong. It's exactly that sort of person that law is trying to stop, and correctly so. You can decide that blacks are inferior or gays immoral or that jews eat babies, but the law says you can't let your own personal prejudices effect other people. Construct whatever belief structure you like, based on whatever makes sense to you, but you can't inflict in on others. It's not just the law, it's a really good law.\n\n \n First, how is the photographer in this case inflicting something on others by not wanting to participate? Again, the photographer didn't try to prevent the wedding from happening ... he or she just didn't want to participate. Second, the law may indeed say you can't let your personal prejudices effect other people, but I'm talking about people with religious convictions that aren't necessarily prejudiced. And the problem in this case (IMO) is that the law doesn't make any effort to distinguish between the two. Hence we have this case of the photographer. I think in regards to the issue of gay marriage, religious conviction is often the real reason, rather than prejudice.",

If it were a wedding (or anything else, really) that I strongly objected to moralistically, I probably wouldn't want to facilitate someone else doing it.\n\n Again, EVERY bigotry I can think of involves a \"strongly objected to\" moralistic value.\n Racists deeply hold \"moralistic values\" on blacks.\n Anti-semites deeply hold \"moralistic values\" on Jews.\n \n All you're doing is rephrasing the bigotry as a \"moralistic value\", and ignoring the fact that you have not refuted the fact that it IS bigotry.\n \n \n \nThat's not to say I'd try to PREVENT it happening, but that's not the same as the choice to participate.\n\n And with blacks in the South, they were surrounded by people who wanted \"the choice\" to not \"participate\".\n By not renting hotel rooms to blacks.\n By not serving blacks food.\n By not sitting blacks on the bus near whites.\n \n All you're doing is attempting to rephrase this, but you are refuting nothing.\n \n \n \nYou yourself just gave an example of something that you'd be moralistically opposed to (in your case, on the basis that you feel it is harmful and against the law), and would balk on it, and so you too wouldn't want to facilitate that. \n\n The fact that it was ILLEGAL went far and beyond just \"moralistically opposed to\".\n He also mentioned HARMFUL, but all you want to mention is that he was \"moralistically opposed\".\n \n I would venture that Kronus's potential refusal would be based more on ILLEGAL and HARMFUL than just a broader, more arbitrary claim of \"moralistically opposed\".\n \n \n \nFirst, how is the photographer in this case inflicting something on others by not wanting to participate?\n\n This same approach would try to mute and ignore the discrimination against blacks in hotels, eating, and bus seating.\n Was somebody \"infliecting something\" on blacks by requiring they eat, sleep, or sit somewhere else?\n \n \n \nAgain, the photographer didn't try to prevent the wedding from happening ... he or she just didn't want to participate.\n\n Do you want us to give the photographer credit cause he could have acted worse than he actually did?\n Kind of like giving a rapist credit cause he only raped the girl, but didn't kill her also?\n \n \n \nSecond, the law may indeed say you can't let your personal prejudices effect other people, but I'm talking about people with religious convictions that aren't necessarily prejudiced.\n\n How do you define \"prejudice\" then?\n \n I can't wait to hear this one, cause the next obvious step would be to apply the same definition of \"prejudice\" to other examples of illegal \"prejudice\".\n Oh wait.

   "Foudit, you've slipped into your accusation mode (\"obfuscation!!\") and long post stream-of-consciousness commentary/questions with most of your responses, and I'm not interested in discussing with you in that mode. I'll respond to what I believe are some main points. If there are any other things you want answered, list them concisely, please.\n \n \nHow can you possibly look at this and question whether it IS a legitimate \"moralistic conviction\"?(And don't think I didn't notice the sudden rephrasing away from \"religious conviction\" to \"moralistic conviction\". EVERY bigotry I can think of involves a \"moralistic conviction\". Whether it be thinking women belong in the home, married and pregnant, to thinking jews are evil, to thinking blacks are inferior...\n Your approach is opening the door to excuse and ignore EVERY bigotted discrimination...)\n\n \n I think the issue of marriage in the opposite-gender sense IS something that is definitively in the Bible enough to warrant someone accurately saying they have strong religious convictions without it being a case of bigotry. All your strawmen about 'jews are evil', or women home pregnant are just that: strawmen. For that matter, the fact that OTHER examples of bigotry exist doesn't mean moralistic objection to gay marriage is an example of bigotry.\n \n \nWhat the Bible \"doesn't allow\" the FOLLOWERS to do is entirely different from what the Bible doesn't allow the followers to take pictures of. It's not an \"oversimplification\".\n \"Oversimplification\" is your code-word for ignoring the fact that it is NOT WRITTEN IN THE BIBLE.\n Furthermore, you cannot INTELLIGIBLY DERIVE its presence in the bible either.\n \n [... no direct scripture in the Bible about taking photographs.... ] emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n \n Foundit, get real. Do you really not understand the concept of not wanting to participate in an activity that you don't agree with moralistically? Come on. emoticon_rolleyes I really do think most people do.\n \n \nAre you telling me that Christians ONLY do business with people who \"agree with\" their religion?\n ONLY with non-sinners?\n Christians would go out of business if so.\n\n \n Many Christians base their business on things the believe strongly, moralistically. \n \n \nAnd it is THAT fact that you just can't seem to honestly address, or wrap your head around.\n The \"moralistic objection\" means that THEY THEMSELVES don't have gay sex, or engage in a gay relationship.\n\n \n WRONG. It may also mean they don't participate (even in a much less DIRECT way) in the activity, such as helping facilitate a marriage they don't religiously support. You seem to have this idea of morality that people should somehow help support ANYthing they disagree with as long as they aren't doing it themselves. That's pretty darn unrealistic.\n \n \nAnd out comes the comparisons between homosexuality and child molestation.\n I guess you earn points for surprising me in that...\n \n It's ILLEGAL jyoshu.\n \n As for the \"6th wife\", taking pictures does not denote support.\n\n \n \n Well I would hope the fact that it's illegal would be the last reason you'd find it morally wrong. The fact it's illegal is beside the point here in regards to MY point. \n \n And while I'm thinking about it .... Holy Context, Batman!!! For the record, please CAN the knee-jerk default accusation of \"comparisons between homosexuality and child molestation.\" NO ONE has said the two are alike in any way here other than analogy to show how some have moralistic views. People should be able to use an analogy in regards to the CURRENT CONTEXT without you assuming EVERY time that someone is making the argument one is like the other in a way that's not being intended. People shouldn't have to accompany every analogy they make about marriage with some disclaimer saying that they aren't arguing the two are alike in EVERY way or even a way that's OUTSIDE the context of the discussion.\n \n Now, with that out of the way (hopefully), I disagree with you that \"simply taking pictures\" doesn't help facilitate the wedding. People choose to not participate in things ALL the time due to moralistic views. They go farther than just not doing it themselves.\n \n \nHow do you define prejudice then?\n\n \n As opposed to religious belief? I define it as when someone is opposed to someone else because of something about that person they can't help or shouldn't need to help. (As opposed to religious belief that is more out of the religion itself than because the way a person is.)\n \n Anyway, I'm not going to argue ad infinitum about all this with you with your extremely long non-concise posting. I'm confident my views are because of religious belief about marriage (I support gay rights in every other way I can think of and do so with marriage benefits even with THIS issue) and I see no reason a photographer should be forced to participate in an event he strongly disagrees with religiously where he's not causing a \"roadblock\", preventing the wedding at all, or even preventing the finding of a photographer, really. If you want to continue on with your points, go right ahead, but I don't have time to go through and dissect a lot of inconcise posting full of rhetorical/non-rhetorical questions.\n \n \nFrom my side, I see nothing but obfuscation and misdirection.\n\n \n Of course you do. If the discussion isn't going EXACTLY the way you want it rather than someone else having a different way of looking at things and discussing that way, you usually start accusing them of 'obfuscation and misdirection.' hey, you're famous here for it!",

And not work on \"bar mitzvahs\" when they don't share that religion?\n You have this myopic perspective of focusing JUST on this issue, ignoring the REAL WORLD when Christians ignore the same mentality on NUMEROUS other issues.\n \n Why is it that Christians have such a problem in taking pictures of gay couples, but when it comes to Jewish couples, there has been NO COMPLAINT.\n \n \n \nWell I would hope the fact that it's illegal would be the last reason you'd find it morally wrong. The fact it's illegal is beside the point here in regards to MY point.\n\n And your hope would be accurate.\n I never hinted that I saw it as \"morally wrong\" just because it was illegal.\n What I DID say, and which you obviously didn't get, is that the fact that it is ILLEGAL is the aspect which defines the refusal of service.\n Not simple \"I morally don't agree\"...\n \n The fact that it is illegal is not \"beside\" the point.\n It IS the point of the RESPONSE on WHY service would be refused.\n But that's not convenient for you, so you ignore it.\n \n \n \nAnd while I'm thinking about it .... Holy Context, Batman!!! For the record, please CAN the knee-jerk default accusation of \"comparisons between homosexuality and child molestation.\" NO ONE has said the two are alike. People should be able to use an analogy in regards to the CURRENT CONTEXT without you assuming EVERY time that someone is making the argument one is like the other in a way that's not being intended. People shouldn't have to accompany every analogy they make about marriage with a disclaimer saying that they aren't arguing the two are alike in a way that's OUTSIDE the context of the discussion.\n\n You're missing the point in the same manner that you bypassed the REAL REASON WHY \"illegal\" was brought up in the first place.\n You tried to talk about people not doing the job out of \"moralistic convictions\". But the REAL REASON extends well and beyond that.\n The REAL REASONS, which you should stop trying to misrepresent, are NOT JUST simple \"moralistic conviction\", but involve:\n 1) Harm to a child\n 2) Illegal activity.\n \n But I guess I can take your response to mean that from now on, I can simply make every \"Christian\" analogy involve child molestation, and you won't take any offense to it.\n \n \n \nNow, with that out of the way (hopefully), I disagree with you that \"simply taking pictures\" doesn't help facilitate the wedding.\n\n Quote me.\n Where did I say \"doesn't help facilitate\"?\n \n I'm getting tired of you taking creative strawman licensing with what WAS said.\n \n \n \nPeople choose to not participate in things ALL the time due to moralistic views. They go farther than just not doing it themselves.\n\n Yes. They do.\n But racists who don't want \"to participate\" with blacks are often forbidden.\n Misogynists who don't want \"to participate\" with women are often forbidden.\n Anti-semites who don't want \"to participate\" with jews are often forbidden.\n \n By your approach, ALL of those laws go away when it is on \"religious\" grounds.\n And exactly how many of them do you think will claim \"it's not on religious grounds\" after you establish your precedent?\n \n \n \nAs opposed to religious belief? I define it as when someone is opposed to someone else because of something about that person they can't help or shouldn't need to help. (As opposed to religious belief that is more out of the religion itself than because the way a person is.)\n\n I really don't see the distinction you try to establish here towards gays.\n And regarding Jews, can't religion be changed? Can't a Jew change his religion to be Christian?",

   "No, a real discussion on Constitutional law would acknowledge that when conflicting values are measured, the balance returns on the side of protecting Constitutional rights, not preventing discrimination.\n\n I can shoot down this claim rather quickly and efficiently by pointing to religiously based anti-semitic or handicapped prejudice or gender prejudice view-points, which are not \"protected\" when it comes to discrimination laws.\n You're wrong in your claim. It varies on case by case, based on the merits of either side.\n \n \n \nThus, in the balance between a free speech/exercise claim against discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation, the speech/exercise claim ought to win because free speech/exercise is a fundamental right, and sexual orientation is not a suspect classification.\n\n Not being a \"suspect class\" doesn't mean that discrimination is automatically ignored.\n Take Romer v Evans for example. Homosexuality was not a \"suspect class\" there, but the court found on the side of gays anyways.\n \n There are MULTIPLE classifications that are not \"suspect classifications\" which would still clearly qualify.\n Gender is not a \"suspect class\".\n Are you presuming that a guy who refused to do photography for women would be exempt from discrimination laws?\n \n \n \nSadly this is a consequence of valuing free speech and free exercise. I do not suggest that these rights are absolute; only that they are fundamental subject to judicial strict scrutiny. Moreover, sexual orientation, as opposed to race or religion, is not a suspect classification.\n\n Religion is not a \"suspect classification\".\n \n To be considered a suspect classification in the U.S. a group must meet all of the following criteria:[*]The groups' characteristics are immutable. (Race, national origin) [*]The group shares a history of discrimination. [*]The group is politically impotent. [*]The group is a discrete and insular minority. (see U.S. v. Carolene Products)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspect_class\n You fail the very first test. Religion is not immutable.\n Heck. You fail the second and third tests as well when it comes to \"Christianity\".\n \n \n \nI do not sympathize with trying to compare the discrimination against sexual orientation which occur today with the discrimination against people of color in the past. There are virtually no substantive similarities between the two.\n\n You don't sympathize because you support discrimination against gays, and oppose it against blacks.\n That's the bottom line.\n \n We can change the example to \"religion\" (which has now been exposed as NOT a \"suspect class\"), or handicapped, or gender, or a variety of other classifications to expose the effects of your action.\n \n If a photographer refused to photograph a < insert religion, gender, handicap, etc here <, you would support the photographers bigotry.\n \n \n \nAgain, I do not suggest that free speech/exercise is absolute; only that it is fundamental. Sexual orientation has not been found to be a suspect classification, and therefore cannot override the fundamental right to free speech/exercise.\n\n Blatantly wrong.\n \"rational basis\" can still disqualify the discrimination, even if you try to claim it is \"free speech\".\n Discrimination is not \"free speech\". It is not \"free speech\" if I refuse to serve a black person, or refuse to give a handicapped person a room at a hotel.",

   "So is this position holding to a pretense that some biblical \"laws\" or \"commandments\" are more important than others?\n\n \n Foundit, I'm going to start the practice some of labeling my responses to you, because I find some of your questions to be repetitive, and I don't want to have to repeat myself in my answers. (e.g. you repeated the \"misogyny, racism,\" etc. examples and point several times.) I may refer you back to a letter if I feel that letter addresses something. I'm sure you'll have something negative to say about this, but I'm sorry, I just don't have the time to rehash a bunch of stuff.\n \n A. Absolutely. Obviously something as important as marriage is going to be considered by some to be more important than, say, eating pork.\n \n \nWhen people have prejudices against jews, blacks, or women, they are often based on RELIGION AS WELL.\n The fact that something is based in religion is NOT a defense against it being a bigotry.\n\n \n B. The fact prejudices against those (anti-semitism, racism. etc.) are sometimes rooted in religion doesn't at all mean that the religious objection to gay marriage that some have is rooted in prejudice.\n \n \nI have never made a simplistic claim that just being a moralistic objection makes it \"bigotry\".\n I support my stance that these are examples of bigotry by showing the disproportionate response to the one \"sin\", as opposed to other sins.\n\n \n See answer A for response on the fact gay marriage is more often an issue than other issues in the Bible.\n \n \nWhen it comes to \"I won't take pictures of atheist couples\" or \"I won't take pictures of people on their second marriage\", we don't hear those stories.\n No stories of \"You're buddhist? I can't work for you.\"\n THAT DISCREPANCY is what points out the bigotry.\n\n \n C. Why are you not open to to possibility that we hear about it more because religious people feel it is a bigger problem since it is related to the Biblical concept of marriage? Why the assumption that this only and automatically demonstrates bigotry and nothing else.\n \n \nJyoshu, get real. Do you really not understand the concept of racists, anti-semites, misogynists, etc, etc, being forced (by law) to participate in activities that you don't agree with moralistically? \n I think most people get that when we make laws that says \"you can't discriminate against blacks, jews, women, ...\", that we are forcing some people to \"participate in activities\" that they would moralistically object to.\n \n Why won't you acknowledge that? (rhetorical question...)\n\n \n D.Again, you can bring up every negative thing or every example of bigotry there ever was and it doesn't prove or demonstrate that most cases of religious objection to gay marriage is nothing more than bigotry! Why won't you acknowlege THAT? (Rhetorical or not at your discretion, I don't care)\n \n \nMOST Christians do not extend their \"religious\" life onto their business dealings.\n They don't find out that their boss is an atheist, and then quit.\n They don't find out that their customer is on his second marriage, and then refuse to do business with them.\n EVERYBODY violates the Christian law. NOBODY lives by it perfectly.\n Based on your approach, christians couldn't do business with anybody.\n\n \n E. You are wrong about this in many cases. Do you really think there's much of a percentage of Bible belt Christians owning and operate liquor stores? How about owning and operating adult bookstores? People let their religion effect who and what they deal with on a business basis ALL THE TIME. Sure, there are some exceptions I'm sure, but I don't think it's all that common for practicing Christians to own an adult bookstore. (And before you jump all over this, I am NOT saying gay marriage is like adult bookstores or liquor; I am simply using the examples to show you that Christians DO INDEED 'extend their \"religious\" life onto their business dealings.'\n \n \nDo Christian hotel owners require the renting people to be married? And on their first marriage? Do Christian caterers require that the marriage be only on the first marriage? And not work on \"bar mitzvahs\" when they don't share that religion? You have this myopic perspective of focusing JUST on this issue, ignoring the REAL WORLD when Christians ignore the same mentality on NUMEROUS other issues.\n\n \n First, see answer E again. Now, for your examples of where Christians operate business knowing people COULD sin, there are many where they don't operate them in cases where they feel it IS sin. Gay marriage falls under the latter for many religious people. They believe it is, so they don't want to participate in it. There is a distinction here between where religious people feel they COULD sin, and where they DO sin. \n \n \nAnd your hope would be accurate.\n I never hinted that I saw it as \"morally wrong\" just because it was illegal.\n What I DID say, and which you obviously didn't get, is that the fact that it is ILLEGAL is the aspect which defines the refusal of service.\n Not simple \"I morally don't agree\"...The fact that it is illegal is not \"beside\" the point. It IS the point of the RESPONSE on WHY service would be refused.\n But that's not convenient for you, so you ignore it.\n\n \n F. The law certainly wouldn't be MY reason to refuse service. My reason would be that I felt it was wrong INDEPENDENT of what the law says. But that's just me.\n \n \nThe REAL REASONS, which you should stop trying to misrepresent, are NOT JUST simple \"moralistic conviction\", but involve:\n 1) Harm to a child\n 2) Illegal activity.\n\n \n G. Moralistic conviction and these 2 things are not necessarily independent of each other. In fact, these ARE you moralistic convictions. Morals. Whatever you want to call it. These are the basis for YOUR moralistic convictions in this case. Others may have the same reasons, or may ALSO have religious ones.\n \n \nBut racists who don't want \"to participate\" with blacks are often forbidden.\n Misogynists who don't want \"to participate\" with women are often forbidden.\n Anti-semites who don't want \"to participate\" with jews are often forbidden.By your approach, ALL of those laws go away when it is on \"religious\" grounds.\n\n \n See answer B as well as D.\n \n \nI really don't see the distinction you try to establish here towards gays. And regarding Jews, can't religion be changed? Can't a Jew change his religion to be Christian?\n\n \n H. I don't see where you've established a relationship. For the 3rd time now, just because misogyny, racism, and everything else in your parade of horribles exists as examples of bigotry doesn't mean that belief about gay marriage is the same thing in most cases of religious people. Assuming this relationship is fallacious on your part ... see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_fallacy",

It varies on case by case, based on the merits of either side.\n\n This is not inconsistent with anything I said. For example, it's entirely possible that ending racial or religious discrimination might be a value that is as highly protected as speech/exercise. It just so happens that ending sexual orientation discrimination is not.\n \n \nNot being a \"suspect class\" doesn't mean that discrimination is automatically ignored.\n ayTake Romer v Evans for example. Homosexuality was not a \"suspect class\" there, but the court found on the side of gays anyways.\n\n Romer v.

This was a (wrong) decision made by the Supreme Court, but that doesn't matter. The Supreme Court has not found sexual orientation to be a suspect classification, and thus the balance should sway in favor of a fundamental right; in this instance free exercise/speech.\n \n \nReligion is not a \"suspect classification\".\n \n To be considered a suspect classification in the U.S. a group must meet all of the following criteria:[*]The groups' characteristics are immutable. (Race, national origin) [*]The group shares a history of discrimination. [*]The group is politically impotent. [*]The group is a discrete and insular minority. (see U.S. v. Carolene Products)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspect_class\n You fail the very first test. Religion is not immutable.\n Heck. You fail the second and third tests as well, along with the fourth when it comes to \"Christianity\".\n\n Religious exercise is, in the very least, treated as a suspect classification. I don't have the time to get the caselaw on that, but it is true that religious exercise classifications are treated with strict scrutiny. Here's an article that explains suspect classifications in layman's terms, and the article says that religion has been declared a suspect classification.\n \n However, a direct First Amendment argument is all that is needed to establish free speech/exercise as a fundamental right since the text of the document explicitly protects it. Thus, even without the 14th Amendment, the right to speech if protected by strict scrutiny. It is just that the 14th Amendment, through the doctrine of incorporation, makes that 1st Amendment protection apply against state governments as well.\n \n \nYou don't sympathize because you support discrimination against gays, and oppose it against blacks.\n That's the bottom line.\n\n No, I don't support it because it is a ridiculous and spurious comparison. You can, of course, try to prove me wrong. All you need to do is point out the areas that are substantively the same in both cases. By substantive, I mean something like the following:[*]It is not true today that people must attend separate schools on the basis of their sexual orientation like it was true in history that people had to attend separate schools on the basis of their race.[*]It is not true today that people must use separate water fountains on the basis of their sexual orientation like it was true in history that people had to use separate water fountains on the basis of their race.[*]It is not true today that people must sit in a particular seat on the bus on the basis of their sexual orientation like it was true in history that people had to sit in a particular seat on the bus on the basis of their race.[*]It is not true today that people must use separate restroom facilities on the basis of their sexual orientation like it was true in history that people had to use separate restroom facilities on the basis of their race.[*]It is not true today that people are prohibited from serving on juries on the basis of their sexual orientation like it was true in history that people were prohibited from serving on juries on the basis of their race.This list could go on and on.\n \n \nWe can change the example to \"religion\" (which has now been exposed as NOT a \"suspect class\"), or handicapped, or gender, or a variety of other classifications to expose the effects of your action.\n\n Again, religion is treated as a suspect classification, and for obvious reasons (beginning with the fact that it is explicitly protected by text in the Constitution).\n \n \nIf a photographer refused to photograph a < insert religion, gender, handicap, etc here <, you would support the photographers bigotry.\n\n Saying that I think something should be permitted does not mean that I support it. I do not, generally, think people should be compelled to violate their conscience just because someone else might be offended by it. I do not, generally, believe that someone should be compelled to do business in opposition to their respective moral beliefs.\n \n \nBlatantly wrong.\n \"rational basis\" can still disqualify the discrimination, even if you try to claim it is \"free speech\".\n\n A law curtailing free speech must satisfy strict scrutiny because free speech is a fundamental right. Period.\n \n There might be compelling reasons for the government to step in (see above list of racial discriminations), but barring that, government cannot abridge free speech/exercise.\n \n \nDiscrimination is not \"free speech\". It is not \"free speech\" if I refuse to serve a black person, or refuse to give a handicapped person a room at a hotel.\n\n The Constitution, like it or lump it, does not apply to private individuals or entities. Now, Congress can (on an expanded theory of interstate commerce) \"convince\" private entities to do some thing (stop discriminating) through the power of the purse; but that is the extent of it.",

It just so happens that ending sexual orientation discrimination is not.\n\n Based on your subjective and personal evaluation.\n Based on your personal prejudice.\n \n What you also need to wrap your brain around is that the citizens or legislature of this state have decided that \"ending sexual orientation discrimination\" has a value.\n YOU do not share that value.\n But that IS their value.\n \n \n \nRomer v.

Consistent with constitutional law and an acknowledgement of protection against discrimination.\n \n But I am sure that simply saying \"that's wrong\", ignore protection against discrimination, and leave it at that.\n \n \n \nIf you want to know what I think the law should be, I would say that private businesses should be allowed to refuse their services to anyone they choose for whatever reason they choose.\n\n Interesting. Your world would perpetuate discrimination against blacks, Jews, handicapped, along with everybody else.\n \n A Utopia for the majority's prejudices, but hardly a protector of minority rights.\n \n \n \nAs for what the law does say, gender has been assimilated into a suspect classification, which is why it is subjected to higher scrutiny.\n\n False.\n It is \"intermediate scrutiny\".\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_scrutiny\n \n And the really funny thing is that the article you quote later EXPLICITLY DENOUNCES your claim: \"Women's groups have long fought to have gender elevated to a suspect class, but the Supreme Court has yet to endorse that position.\"\n Is your link wrong?\n \n \n \nThe Supreme Court has not found sexual orientation to be a suspect classification, and thus the balance should sway in favor of a fundamental right; in this instance free exercise/speech.\n\n Just because it is not a \"suspect class\" doesn't mean much.\n Romer v Evans, as you pointed out, did not make homosexuality a \"suspect class\" either, but it DID find that the government was violating even \"rational basis\".\n Much like Lawrence v Texas.\n \n You inappropriately try to pass off \"not suspect class\" as if that's all that needs to be said. Pretend that means discrimination wins.\n There are three levels of scrutiny: Strict Scrutiny, Intermediate, and Rational Basis.\n If the government fails the appropriate test, it does not matter if it is \"not suspect class\". Discriminion loses.\n \n \n \nReligious exercise is, in the very least, treated as a suspect classification. I don't have the time to get the caselaw on that, but it is true that religious exercise classifications are treated with strict scrutiny. Here's an article that explains suspect classifications in layman's terms, and the article says that religion has been declared a suspect classification.\n\n Hmmm. No court citation on where that was supposedly done.\n Wikipedia vs answers.com...\n \n Quite frankly, I find the true evaluation of such a situation to be much simpler.\n You proclaim that such \"religious\" protection would insulate religion against discrimination charges, yet the facts show that no such insulation exists. People can't discriminate against people based on handicap, gender, and a variety of other categories.\n \n Furthermore, your claim brings up an interesting dilemma.\n Is it plausible for a person to discriminate BASED ON religion AGAINST a second party's religion...\n \n \n \nHowever, a direct First Amendment argument is all that is needed to establish free speech/exercise as a fundamental right since the text of the document explicitly protects it.\n\n And again, PROVEN FALSE by simply reviewing the fact that a person practicing discrimination can't say \"free speech\", and have it excuse his discrimination. He can't say \"free exercise\", and have it excuse his discrimination which has been made illegal by the law.\n \n Let me guess.\n All of THOSE rulings in the past are \"wrongly decided\" as well?\n Are we evaluating these things according to how you WANT things to be? or according to how they ACTUALLY ARE?\n \n \n \nNo, I don't support it because it is a ridiculous and spurious comparison. You can, of course, try to prove me wrong. All you need to do is point out the areas that are substantively the same in both cases.

They PERPETUATED that, didn't they...\n \n The reality is that discrimination is not ended based on a group suffering too much.\n Let me repeat that. A discrimination against a group is NOT ended based on the extent of suffering that group has experienced.\n \n I am not trying to compare the EXTENT of the discriminatory practices.\n What I AM saying is that the REASONS that the discrimination is unconstitutional have much in overlap. Often, the exact same arguments are used to try to justify discrimination against gays AS WERE PREVIOUSLY USED AGAINST BLACKS.\n \n But to address your list...\n When have people been institutionalized based solely upon race? \n How many blacks were subjugated to shock treatments? Lobotomies?\n Laws in New York City used to explicitly forbid bars from serving to a homosexual, in order to prevent the existence of \"gay bars\". Any overlap with that and blacks?\n Juries and homosexuals? How can you let somebody who is classified as \"mentally ill\" serve on a jury?\n \n \n \nAgain, religion is treated as a suspect classification, and for obvious reasons (beginning with the fact that it is explicitly protected by text in the Constitution).\n\n So you claim.\n I quoted the test, and religion violates the VERY FIRST STEP of that test.\n Not sure how you can really get around that...\n \n \n \nSaying that I think something should be permitted does not mean that I support it.\n\n I use \"support\" with the same mentality that some around here use \"support\" to try to bolster a reason why they should be allowed to refuse to do something that doesn't really show any \"support\" for when they do the job.\n \n \n \nA law curtailing free speech must satisfy strict scrutiny because free speech is a fundamental right. Period.\n\n Funny how you shifted that.\n Earlier, you said: Phyllis: \"Again, I do not suggest that free speech/exercise is absolute; only that it is fundamental. Sexual orientation has not been found to be a suspect classification, and therefore cannot override the fundamental right to free speech/exercise.\"\n \n Well, to address this new statement, it will satisfy \"strict scrutiny\" in the same way that laws preventing discrimination against the handicapped survive.\n Simple enough statement which avoids the whole debacle on whether or not \"religion\" is or is not a \"suspect class\", and points to a real life example that obviously survives.\n By your approach, laws prohibiting discrimination against the handicapped could not survive because the handicapped are not a \"suspect class\".\n Which brings us back around to another one of those cases where you think it should be a way it just plain is not.\n \n Maybe it would do the purposes of conversation best if you would stop trying to argue in terms of way you want it, and start arguing in terms of the way things really are.\n \n \n \nThere might be compelling reasons for the government to step in (see above list of racial discriminations), but barring that, government cannot abridge free speech/exercise.\n\n And yet when \"compelling reasons\" are shown, namely ensuring equality for those who are discriminated against, you ignore those.\n Evidently, individual equality is supposedly inferior (in your mind, but not in reality) to the \"free speech\" of people who want to exercise discrimination.\n \n \n \nThe Constitution, like it or lump it, does not apply to private individuals or entities. Now, Congress can (on an expanded theory of interstate commerce) \"convince\" private entities to do some thing (stop discriminating) through the power of the purse; but that is the extent of it.\n\n \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\"\n Granted, not in the constitution like \"equality\" is present in the constitution, but a legally enforced doctrine nonetheless.\n \n One has to question how much \"liberty\" and \"pursuit of happiness\" one can pursue when a large segment of society is purposely allowed to grossly discriminate against the minority.\n Not much, is the real answer...\n \n Regardless of how you don't like it, these laws preventing discrimination exist. They exist for a reason.\n Because the majority (an OVERWHELMING majority) want them to exist.\n \n There is no bible verse which says \"thou shalt not serve homosexuals\".\n It is an obvious focused perversion of the extent of the religion when one sees people enforcing \"thou shalt not serve homosexuals\", but jews, divorcees, people who work on the sabbaoth, and women who don't realize that their place is to \"...learn in silence with all subjection\" and \"suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.\"\n \n Even today, our government CELEBRATES the freedom of religion which allows \"jews\" and \"atheists\" to run around without discrimination, yet a unilateral interpretation of the \"thou shalt not serve ...\" philosophy would obviously lead to people objecting because they have to serve jews and atheists.\n \n This ain't about \"religion\".\n It's about prejudice masquerading as \"religion\".",

   "First, let me start out by identifying the non-sequiturs that deserve no response.\n I wasn't saying what they pretend to respond to, so their comment is like asking about the spine of a zebra and getting a response on the zebra being black and white.\n B, D, F, H.\n \n And a quick response to H, I only list other \"discriminations\" by \"religion\" which share the quality of also being restricted by the law.\n The REAL association involved is that if your reasoning is valid for allowing discrimination against gays, then your reasoning is also valid for allowing discrimination against race, or religion, or some cases of gender.\n And that's not a fallacy.\n \n To mimic the web-site, what I AM saying is:\n Premise Discrimination against race, religion, and sexual orientation are all examples of \"religiously\" motivated discrimination. \n Premise Jyoshu wants to allow \"religiously\" motivated discrimination and excuse it from laws preventing discrimination. \n Conclusion If laws preventing discrimination are bypassed based on \"religious motivation\" for the discrimination, then racial, religious, AND sexual orientation discrimination is allowed.\n \n THAT is what is really going on, and it is NOT a fallacy of association (as documented in your link).\n If you think it is association fallacy, then kindly fill in the blanks of A, B, and C on that web-page and explain what my statement is that fits that pattern.\n \n \n \nFoundit, I'm going to start the practice some of labeling my responses to you, because I find some of your questions to be repetitive, and I don't want to have to repeat myself in my answers.\n\n When you REALLY answer the question once, the question doesn't get repeated.\n When you REPEATEDLY fail to broach the issue, I repeat the question.\n Funny how that works...\n \n But if you're going to answer the questions, then I'm all for whatever format you work out...\n \n \n \nSo is this position holding to a pretense that some biblical \"laws\" or \"commandments\" are more important than others?A. Absolutely. Obviously something as important as marriage is going to be considered by some to be more important than, say, eating pork.\n\n That is rather contradictory with many Christian themes.\n Jesus himself was asked what the greatest commandment was, and his reply is something rather more poignant than \"important as marriage\".\n There is nothing \"obvious\" about it, as Christianity is so filled with contradictions, hypocrisies, and blatant ignoring of clearly established rules that little is \"obvious\".\n \n But MODERN Christianity has elevated \"gayness\" to be a sin above all others. Evangelicals fixate on it, while ignoring their sky-rocketing divorce rate that numbers higher than other groups.\n And Jesus actually spoke of divorce, and never of homosexuality.\n And before you do the obvious misrepresentation (that I have seen you do repeatedly before) and ignoring of what I have said, I am not saying homosexuality is not a sin. Rather, I am questioning the weighting of ignoring divorce, which Jesus did discuss, with another \"biblical\" sin of homosexuality, which he never mentioned.\n \n The real answer to this question is simple.\n Show a BIBLICAL justification for why \"homosexuality\" is supposedly a sin requiring more strict response than other sins, like being of a different religion.\n I have no doubt that some INDIVIDUALS are creating their own \"weighing\" system which puts \"homosexuality\" as more severe. That's part and parcel of how bigotry works in the first place.\n \n \n \nSee answer A for response on the fact gay marriage is more often an issue than other issues in the Bible.\n\n And I refute this claim.\n Do you REALLY want to compare the statistics on how many \"gay marriages\" are out there, and how many evangelical DIVORCES are out there?\n Christians FIXATE on it more because it is NOT IN THEIR BACK-YARD. Christians can continue with their \"favored\" vices, while criticizing others for violating a law that they have no desire to break.\n \n \n \nC. Why are you not open to to possibility that we hear about it more because religious people feel it is a bigger problem since it is related to the Biblical concept of marriage? Why the assumption that this only and automatically demonstrates bigotry and nothing else.\n\n Don't give me this \"possibility\" junk.\n It's where you make an argument you cannot prove and you don't even want to try, so you create an \"apologetic\" \"possibility\" to try and bypass the issue.\n Discrimination based on RELIGION is ILLEGAL, just like discrimination based on SEXUAL ORIENTATION (in some areas).\n The number of areas (all 50 states) where discrimination against RELIGION is illegal is MUCH BROADER than that of sexual orientation.\n \n And it is NOT the \"Christians\" who make these items news. It is the DISCRIMINATED AGAINST GROUP which makes it news.\n It is not an issue of \"bigger problem\" either. An atheist who doesn't believe in Jesus goes to hell, right? But that's not as \"big\" of a \"problem\" as two consenting gays?\n \n There IS a dcrepancy there.\n The people who bring these issues to the fore-front are the PEOPLE WHO ARE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST anyways.\n Do you really think that the Christian who says \"no\" to the lesbian couple (when the lesbians don't complain) will go national proclaiming \"I discriminated against somebody based on sexual orientation\"\n The only reason this makes news is when the OBJECT being discriminated against makes it news.\n \n \n \nE. You are wrong about this in many cases. Do you really think there's much of a percentage of Bible belt Christians owning and operate liquor stores? How about owning and operating adult bookstores?\n\n Your analogies have something in common that I actually support.\n If your religious convictions do not allow you to do the job, then DO NOT DO IT.\n So any \"Christian\" who can't take photos of a gay marrying couple in a state that has a law prohibiting discrimination should leave the business and find something else to do.\n THAT is the VALID solution to \"protecting\" religious prejudice.\n \n Otherwise, we're right back to the question of should we allow Muslims to not wash their hands before surgery because of \"religion\".\n \n \n \nDo Christian hotel owners require the renting people to be married? And on their first marriage? Do Christian caterers require that the marriage be only on the first marriage? And not work on \"bar mitzvahs\" when they don't share that religion? You have this myopic perspective of focusing JUST on this issue, ignoring the REAL WORLD when Christians ignore the same mentality on NUMEROUS other issues.\n\n \nFirst, see answer E again. Now, for your examples of where Christians operate business knowing people COULD sin, there are many where they don't operate them in cases where they feel it IS sin. Gay marriage falls under the latter for many religious people. They believe it is, so they don't want to participate in it. There is a distinction here between where religious people feel they COULD sin, and where they DO sin. \n\n No. There is no \"see answer XX\" for this.\n This question is answerable by REAL LIFE EXAMPLES.\n Not just how you imagine people could be.\n \n I realize the distinction you are trying to make, but WHERE does your religion ever make that type of distinction? NEVER.\n Is \"stealing\" a sin only if you didn't realize it was going to happen?\n Is \"working on the sabbaoth\" a sin only if you didn't realize you were doing it?\n \n The truth is that christians that attempt this apologetic route to try to justify discrimination are rewriting \"bible\" that isn't even there. Making up excuse upon excuse, WITHOUT RELIGION, to try and proclaim \"religion\" when the truth is that it's just something they REALLY want to discriminate against.\n \n \n \nG. Moralistic conviction and these 2 things are not necessarily independent of each other. In fact, these ARE you moralistic convictions. Morals. Whatever you want to call it. These are the basis for YOUR moralistic convictions in this case. Others may have the same reasons, or may ALSO have religious ones.\n\n Now who is trying to ignore distinctions?\n It's like saying \"I dropped a table-spoon of water on the floor\" is the same thing as \"I dropped 2 tons of water on the floor\" because they are both water on the floor...\n Lawrence v Texas clearly established something that most people should realize. \n \"First, the fact that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice...\"\n Likewise, claims of \"morality\" in and of themselves are insufficient to justify personal discrimination for a lot of people.\n It requires something stronger, like preventing or not contributing to harm of another, to justify such discrimination for some people.",

If your prejudice has religious roots it's still prejudice and still wrong. Your short responses seem to indicate that you don't really want to talk about this any longer, and I guess that's fine.\n\n \n Well, Of course we should try to get to the root of prejudices and end prejudice. No one here disagrees with that, I suspect. But there's nothing wrong with being willing to examine it and make sure it really is prejudice or religious belief. The need to end the roots of prejudice, while important, is beside the point of whether or not religious people should be forced to do things against their religion if it's BECAUSE of their religion they don't want to participate. Where the rub lies for me is that, in the eyes of the whether someone can be sued, no one seems to CARE whether the non-participation is out of prejudice OR genuine religion belief. And we should care, because many people who feel this way aren't doing it out of prejudice. They're doing it because of their religious belief. I know you probably aren't going to believe that no matter what I say, but it's true.\n \n \nNo, it's not a shrug. These are the rights of gay people to not face discrimination. Why does religion deserve a special status that allows it to violate people's rights, where nothing else is given the same privilege? Why does religion allow such indifference to another person being treated with respect, humanity, and rights? That's not saying much for religion.\n\n \n Reforming religion itself is another topic entirely. In terms of why religion gets \"special status\" and people have the freedom to not have to forced to go against their religion, it DOES get special status under our constitution--the very first amendment ensures freedom of religion. If you want to change the constitution, you can try to get the 1st Amendment pulled, but you have a lot of work to do and a difficult uphill climb to make that happen.\n \n \nThis also concerns religion's undeserved place in society:\n \"You can't get away with saying, 'If you try to stop me from insulting homosexuals it violates my freedom of prejudice.' But you can get away with saying, 'It violates my freedom of religion.' What, when you think about it, is the difference? Yet again, religion trumps all.\"\n \n -Richard Dawkins in the God Delusion, on how hate speech is supported on the basis of religious rights.\n\n \n That's right. We value religious freedom in the states. That's the way it is, by our constitution, and if you don't like religious freedom, it's probably not the place for you. Though Dawkins is probably one of the worst people you could quote in terms of having credibility on matters regarding religious freedom, as he's known for his irrational axe to grind, in a big way.\n \n \nThus, on the case in question, you can't get away with saying it violates your freedom to discriminate, but believe you can say it violates your freedom of religion.\n\n \n In cases where it really does, yep.\n \n \nWe can look at evidence, experience, logic, when people usually act in such and such a way.\n\n \n And I think that's a good thing. I'd RATHER you look at evidence, logic, and the people in question than lump everything into one basket, automatically placing religion and prejudice rather than being open to the reality that people really do have genuine religious views on this, or assuming it's always prejudice when it might not be, in fact.\n \n \nAnd a quick response to H, I only list other \"discriminations\" by \"religion\" which share the quality of also being restricted by the law. The REAL association involved is that if your reasoning is valid for allowing discrimination against gays, then your reasoning is also valid for allowing discrimination against race, or religion, or some cases of gender.\n And that's not a fallacy. To mimic the web-site, what I AM saying is:\n Premise Discrimination against race, religion, and sexual orientation are all examples of \"religiously\" motivated discrimination. \n Premise Jyoshu wants to allow \"religiously\" motivated discrimination and excuse it from laws preventing discrimination. \n Conclusion If laws preventing discrimination are bypassed based on \"religious motivation\" for the discrimination, then racial, religious, AND sexual orientation discrimination is allowed. THAT is what is really going on, and it is NOT a fallacy of association (as documented in your link).\n\n \n If it is rooted in genuinely religious reasons, then yes. Churches do this all the time, without having to be sued. It may not be the RIGHT thing to do--it's certainly not what my religion consists of--but otherwise you may be forcing religious people to do something against their genuine religious belief. \n \n \nThat is rather contradictory with many Christian themes.\n Jesus himself was asked what the greatest commandment was, and his reply is something rather more poignant than \"important as marriage\".\n There is nothing \"obvious\" about it, as Christianity is so filled with contradictions, hypocrisies, and blatant ignoring of clearly established rules that little is \"obvious\".\n\n \n That's irrelevant. You're always going to be able to find some exception or hole (no matter how large or small) in the Bible. It's not like the issue of marriage and same-gender people having relations is generally considered an absent issue in the Bible. It's generally understood that it IS dealt with. That apologists have come up with other interpretations of these passages is beside the point. As long as there is a strong interpretive bent going on that this is a moralistic issue, then it is. There is NOT a strong interpretive bent going on that the issue of black people is a moralistic issue. Or misogyny. So those examples don't fit here nearly as well.\n \n \nBut MODERN Christianity has elevated \"gayness\" to be a sin above all others. Evangelicals fixate on it, while ignoring their sky-rocketing divorce rate that numbers higher than other groups.\n And Jesus actually spoke of divorce, and never of homosexuality.\n\n \n The work to reform the religion if you want to. That's a separate issue.\n \n \nThe real answer to this question is simple.\n Show a BIBLICAL justification for why \"homosexuality\" is supposedly a sin requiring more strict response than other sins, like being of a different religion.\n\n \n \"Than other sins?\" So if religious people gave them ALL equal weight you'd be ok with that??? :) You're basically arguing that, because one gets more attention than the other as a moralistic issue, that you should be able to force people to go against that belief. That's a pretty poor basis on your part. All religion would have to do is start seeing the OTHERS as moralistic and put equal attention on them, and your problem is solved! \n \n \nI have no doubt that some INDIVIDUALS are creating their own \"weighing\" system which puts \"homosexuality\" as more severe. That's part and parcel of how bigotry works in the first place.\n\n \n It's also part and parcel to how religion works in some cases. But you continue to refuse to be open to that reality. But since when is INDIVIDUALITY in religion grounds to refuse religious freedom? What committee determines the allowable Biblical interpretations, in your thinking? How many verses do you need before you grant religious freedom to not be forced to participate in an event that goes against one's religion?\n \n (And you can consider those either rhetorical OR non-rheotorical, I don't care.)\n \n \nDo you REALLY want to compare the statistics on how many \"gay marriages\" are out there, and how many evangelical DIVORCES are out there?\n\n \n Foundit, you keep bringing up other moralistic issues as if each isn't approached by it's own merits and consequences in religion. \n \n (And the funny thing is, there certainly ARE examples of people who refuse to take part in divorce-related activities due to their religious beliefs, which apparently Foundit doesn't realize. Wonder what percentage of divorce lawyers are practicing evangelical Christians? And a lot of pastors won't marry couples with one of them having been divorced.)\n \n \nYour analogies have something in common that I actually support.\n If your religious convictions do not allow you to do the job, then DO NOT DO IT.\n\n \n No, that's not how religious freedom works. You don't tell churches \"you can't be a church!\" if there's a moral issue that keeps them from allowing people to worship with them for some reason. (And before you jump to the \"that's-a-church-so-it's-different\" response, remember there is NOTHING--NADA--in the constitution indicating that the 1st Amendment is limited to just CHURCHES. Religious freedom is broader than the church doors.) You don't tell pastors \"get out of the ministry\" if one of them won't preach at a church that has a lot of adultery going on among the congregation. (These are real-world things that I know of that have happened, btw, Foundit, before you go acting like this never happens in \"THEIR BACKYARD\". emoticon_rolleyes ) You don't tell a photographer to go photograph an FLDS wedding or get out of the business altogether, if he strongly objects to oppressive weddings and marriages. Well, at least you SHOULDN'T. People should be able to have religious principles in their lives if they want, outside of the church doors.\n \n \nOtherwise, we're right back to the question of should we allow Muslims to not wash their hands before surgery because of \"religion\".\n\n \n Again (and I've already dealt with this), that's an issue that can cause HARM. It's not causing harm for someone to not be forced to be the picture-taker of an event his beliefs don't allow him to participate in; photographers are indeed a dime a dozen.",

If the argument is that this \"without a doubt wrong\" then I'd simply disagree as would many here just as many of you disagree with the idea that gay marriage is \"without a doubt\" wrong.\n\n On one hand, you have the government PRACTICING DISCRIMINATION against gay marriage.\n On the other hand, you have the businesses PRACTICING DISCRIMINATION against gays.\n We want this discrimination to stop.\n \n Why is it so hard to realize the common thread there?\n \n \n \nAnd that's really the crux of the issue, IMO. Except it's really worse than that. It's people being told they have to go against their religious beliefs.\n\n Just like the racist has to \"go against his religious beliefs\" in allowing whites and blacks to co-mingle in his restaurant.\n Just like the anti-semite has to \"go against his religious beliefs\" in hiring a Jew, instead of discriminating based on race.\n Just like the misogynist has to \"go against his religious beliefs\" in taking orders from a female boss, when his bible explicitly forbids it.\n \n I am eternally amused at how much \"NEW\" junk is discovered when it comes to \"gays\".\n Do I see complaints about people having to go against their racist, anti-semitic, or misogynist beliefs? NO.\n But suddenly gays could get included in that, and now it's \"Oh my god. I can't not discriminate against them even though the bible never tells me to do so...\"\n \n \n \nOn what basis do you assume prejudice is present? Why are you not open to the idea that it's just religious belief? (After all we have no indication the people SAID anything hateful about gays, called them names, etc.) I'm curious ... is there any way, in your thinking, that religion can have the idea that gay marriage isn't in God's will and it not be prejudice?\n\n Regarding the examples above, with the racist, anti-semite, and misogynist, would you consider it as \"prejudice\" for those scenarios?\n \n I personally hold it is prejudice when you take your PERSONAL belief, regarding how YOU should live YOUR life, and discriminate against others. It shows an active attempt to throw \"tolerance\" out the window, and purposely discriminate against a group.\n THAT is prejudice.\n \n In the examples above, do you really think that it requires the person involved to \"say something hateful\" in order to make it prejudiced?\n Saying something hateful is ANOTHER EXAMPLE of prejudice.\n It is not the ONLY REQUIREMENT of prejudice.",

   "Well, Of course we should try to get to the root of prejudices and end prejudice. No one here disagrees with that, I suspect.\n\n Adding the caveat that if the \"prejudice\" can claim a religious link, then you oppose the government doing anything about it.\n \n \n \nBut there's nothing wrong with being willing to examine it and make sure it really is prejudice or religious belief. The need to end the roots of prejudice, while important, is beside the point of whether or not religious people should be forced to do things against their religion if it's BECAUSE of their religion they don't want to participate. Where the rub lies for me is that, in the eyes of the whether someone can be sued, no one seems to CARE whether the non-participation is out of prejudice OR genuine religion belief.\n\n There you go again pretending it's an \"either / or\" situation.\n It is entirely possible to BE a \"religious belief\" AND \"prejudice\".\n In fact, I can quote you MULTIPLE bible passages which if it weren't in the bible, we would all agree were prejudiced.\n But we both know you avoid discussing the bible's endorsement of slavery and misogyny, so why waste my time...\n \n \n \nAnd we should care, because many people who feel this way aren't doing it out of prejudice. They're doing it because of their religious belief.\n\n Quite frankly, this reveals the privileged nature of \"religion\" in that it gets a \"get-out-of-jail-free-card\" on things.\n Could you imagine if \"Oh.

I shouldn't have bothered you with equality then.\" was legitimate?\n It HAS NOT MATTERED FOR DECADES if the racist, misogynist, or anti-semite behaved as he did because of \"religion\" or just another reason.\n But for some reason, in \"some\" people's minds, \"religious\" beliefs trump all.\n \n \n \nReforming religion itself is another topic entirely. In terms of why religion gets \"special status\" and people have the freedom to not have to forced to go against their religion...\n\n Stop right there.\n WRONG.\n People do NOT have the freedom to not be \"forced to go against their religion\" in business.\n That's what this thread is all about.\n \n They didn't get that \"freedom\" when it came to racism.\n They didn't get that \"freedom\" when it came to anti-semitism.\n They didn't get that \"freedom\" when it came to gender.\n And they are NOT getting that \"freedom\" when it comes to sexual orientation.\n \n You WANT them to have that freedom, but a VAST MAJORITY are firmly against you.\n \n \n \n... it DOES get special status under our constitution--the very first amendment ensures freedom of religion. If you want to change the constitution, you can try to get the 1st Amendment pulled, but you have a lot of work to do and a difficult uphill climb to make that happen.\n\n Another reality check.\n We've had the first amendment for well over 200 years.\n We have ALSO been ignoring claims of KKKhristians who have \"religious beliefs\" for discriminating against blacks.\n There is no need to change the constitution.\n \n Your fantasy world just ain't gonna happen.\n \n \n \nThat's right.

I have tears in my eyes.\n Jyoshu. We ALSO value \"religious freedom\", but not UNLIMITED \"religious freedom\" to discriminate against others in business.\n And if you would take an HONEST and REAL look at history, when the religious racist or the religious anti-semite or the religious misogynist didn't get his way, you would realize that if YOU want \"religious freedom\" to trump discrimination laws, then it is YOU who need to realize that this country is \"probably not the place for you\".\n \n Got it?",

The fact that they could get another photographer doesn't excuse the photographer's behavior; it's still discrimination.\n\n \n I think it depends on the situation, and the effects it has on the people, as to whether or not a given case of discrimination is harmful. There are certainly examples of discrimination in our society that we allow and don't outlaw because the effects of it are not really harmful, so I could never agree with a blanket statement like that saying \"it's wrong\"--it depends on the situation. Personally, I think moralistically this is such a case because I just don't see any real harm at work here. (In fact, making someone go against their religion is an immoral thing taking place here, as this photographer had to do to avoid a lawsuit--in THIS case.) I will grant you though, that because they can't really add exceptions to these laws for everyone situation that comes up that might not really be harmful in any real-world way, the law has to include situations like this. They can't put in a \"this didn't cause any harm\" clause, because some cases truly are harmful. I do think that one also has to gauge whether these other examples really happen much--there aren't nearly that many cases of people refusing to do business with blacks because of religious beliefs. But marriage is a big deal in religion, and so people have religious beliefs about marriage that affect this sort of thing. It's the same reason a RCC priest may not conduct a same-sex wedding. Is a RCC priest's refusal to do a same-sex marriage, or, say marriage outside the CHURCH between two non-Christians just like someone refusing business to a black person? I don't think it is because I think there are definitive religious reasons for it. It may be a form of discrimination, but it's one that society allows for. It's not in the same vein as someone making a black person sit on the back of the bus or refusing them to stay at their hotel.\n \n Also, I disagree that the fact it was a 'commitment ceremony' shows that the bias was against the people as opposed to the type of relationship. I think it's a better bet to say that they don't agree moralistically with gay marriage in the sense of a romantic commitment and sexual relations genuinely because of religion. That it's not technically a legal ceremony isn't really that relevant to that point.\n \n Anyway, I've spent way more time on this than I ever meant to, so with that, I digress.",

I ask this because you have said in the past that you believe the government should stay out of other people's business unless their action is absolutely wrong.\n\n 1) Marriage is a fundamental right.\n 2) Religion is a fundamental right, but NOBODY is telling Christians they can't believe homosexuality is bad.\n \n Mormons believe in polygamy, but we restrict their ACTION to enter into polygamous relationships.\n And that doesn't \"harm\" anybody, does it?\n That is ANOTHER impact of loosening the bounds of religious action.\n \n 3) Despite what you will admit, the segregation IS harmful.\n When a majority of society attempts to send a message to a minority of inferiority and second-place status (like with segregation or refusal of business services), that is harmful.\n \n \n \nyes, I surely AM. Do you really think most religious people even buy into the whole sexual orientation thing? It was their religious views about GAY MARRIAGE that was the incompatibility. Marriage is a big deal in religion. Surely you know this.\n\n So you can point to the photographers who refuse to take pictures for people who get married at the court-house without \"God's\" blessing?\n You can point to the photographers who refuse to take pictures for Buddhists, or atheists, or other religions that don't believe in Christ?\n You can point to the photographers who refuse to take pictures for people on their second or third marriage?\n \n The answer is no.\n It is ONLY \"gay marriage\" which is the issue, and for you to try to pretend it's about \"marriage\" is like having a photographer refuse to take pictures for an \"interracial couple\", and then somebody tries to claim it's not about race but rather about \"marriage\".\n \n \n \nYou may have 'told me that time and time again,' but it doesn't address the issue, because we aren't talking about it \"trumping everything else.\" Sorry, you don't get to decide for society what constitutes being a decent human being, and the law can be wrong.\n\n 1) I'm sorry, but society has already decided on \"discrimination\" issues.\n You lost.\n For you to claim society \"doesn't get to decide\" is pointless denial of reality.\n \n 2) Yes. The law can be wrong.\n But it isn't.\n Can you honestly look at history, and the tragedies that blacks went through with societal discrimination, and say that it was \"wrong\" to make the KKKhristian mentality NOT discriminate against blacks in businesses?\n If you can, then you are truly lost.\n \n \n \nPart of dealing with religious freedom is accepting that people shouldn't have to be forced to do something that violates their religion when that violation isn't harming anyone.\n\n Part of dealing with EQUALITY is accepting that people sometimes ARE FORCED to do something that they don't want to. Whether it be based on presumptive religious privilege, or other \"belief\".\n You sacrifice EQUALITY on the altar of \"religious freedom\", and ignore the tragedies that \"religion\" would perpetuate.",

   "I think it depends on the situation, and the effects it has on the people, as to whether or not a given case of discrimination is harmful. There are certainly examples of discrimination in our society that we allow and don't outlaw because the effects of it are not really harmful, so I could never agree with a blanket statement like that saying \"it's wrong\"--it depends on the situation.\n\n And unfortunately, this is another area where you just plain don't get it.\n Gays have a higher suicide rate because of societal condemnation and prejudice that gays experience.\n And you refuse to acknowledge the harm.\n \n People preaching the \"sin\" or \"evil\" of homosexuality encourage an atmosphere of discrimination against gays. Condemnation of gays.\n If you ##### us, do we not bleed?\n {Edit: Good grief. The automatic posting censors censor Shakespeare...}\n \n And therein lies the harm that you REFUSE to acknowledge.\n \n \n \nPersonally, I think moralistically this is such a case because I just don't see any real harm at work here. (In fact, making someone go against their religion is an immoral thing taking place here, as this photographer had to do to avoid a lawsuit--in THIS case.)\n\n Wow.\n So extrapolating your logic, the \"immoral\" thing was not blacks sitting at the back of the bus.\n Not blacks having a separate drinking fountain.\n Not blacks having refused service.\n \n The immoral thing was for people to have to not be allowed to discriminate against blacks.\n Patently amazing! You are so lost in your religious privilege you will ignore all evil it causes.\n \n \n \nI will grant you though, that because they can't really add exceptions to these laws for everyone situation that comes up that might not really be harmful in any real-world way, the law has to include situations like this. They can't put in a \"this didn't cause any harm\" clause, because some cases truly are harmful.\n\n It's refreshing to see you admit this.\n \n \n \nI do think that one also has to gauge whether these other examples really happen much--there aren't nearly that many cases of people refusing to do business with blacks because of religious beliefs.\n\n That is exactly what the KKK does.\n They take their \"interpretation\" of the bible, with their own \"weighting\" system which puts race at a higher urgency like you want to place \"sexual orientation\" at a higher urgency, and for RELIGIOUS reasons, they endorse racial discrimination.\n \n They have their own bible verses that they quote to their own ends.\n They proclaim service to Christ in their racial prejudice philosophy.\n \n I realize you don't want to discuss this. It is much easier for your patent \"make a claim with no substantiation\" moves.\n But the above are the facts.\n \n \n \nBut marriage is a big deal in religion, and so people have religious beliefs about marriage that affect this sort of thing.\n\n Yes. They do.\n And we have brought up NUMEROUS ASPECTS of those \"religious beliefs\".\n 1) Like Jesus's stance on divorce, and patent exclusion of any form of \"remarriage\". But the church doesn't care. In fact, evangelicals are the worst offenders.\n 2) Like marrying between people who are not Christian. Atheists getting married, and there is no action by anybody about that.\n 3) Like pre-marital sex. No mention can be found of \"Christian\" hotel owners refusing to rent to unmarried couples.\n \n Yes. Christians DO have \"religious beliefs about marriage\". Many of them.\n So why is it that it's only the GAY thing that they have a hang-up on?\n \n \n \nIt's the same reason a RCC priest may not conduct a same-sex wedding. Is a RCC priest's refusal to do a same-sex marriage, or, say marriage outside the CHURCH between two non-Christians just like someone refusing business to a black person? I don't think it is because I think there are definitive religious reasons for it. It may be a form of discrimination, but it's one that society allows for. It's not in the same vein as someone making a black person sit on the back of the bus or refusing them to stay at their hotel.\n\n 1) The RCC is not a business. It's exempt.\n 2) \"not in the same vein\"?\n That claim is ridiculously hollow unless you can explain HOW the black person was supposedly \"harmed\" by that in a way that gays are not \"harmed\" by their received treatment.\n \n \n \nAlso, I disagree that the fact it was a 'commitment ceremony' shows that the bias was against the people as opposed to the type of relationship. I think it's a better bet to say that they don't agree moralistically with gay marriage in the sense of a romantic commitment and sexual relations genuinely because of religion. That it's not technically a legal ceremony isn't really that relevant to that point.\n\n Pathetic dodge of the point.\n If the issue is TRULY about \"marriage\", then why discriminate against people WHO ARE NOT MARRYING?\n \n Face it.\n A HUGE aspect of your excuse was blown out of the water on that one.\n WHY is it so difficult for you to admit the obvious?\n This photographer discriminated AGAINST GAYS.",

   "Are you going to try and tell me that there aren't people who try to claim that certain \"ideals\" in our constitution were 'founded' in Christianity?\n\n \n It's not something anyone here has brought up in this discussion, other than you.\n \n \nThe hard truth of the matter is that there are often constitutional concepts that CONFLICT with each other. And in this case, we are talking about \"freedom of religion\" conflicting with \"equality for all\" when it comes to business discrimination.\n And, like I pointed out, if \"equality for all\" truly was based in christianity, there would be no conflict here.\n But there is, proving the falseness of the original claim.\n\n \n Yes, and I'm glad you're at least seeing this as a conflict of constitutional ideals. \n \n \n2) Actually, that is EXACTLY what you have when it's a person's business (restaurant) and he gets to decide on refusing service based on religious beliefs.

   "I said in the beginning that I don't think everyone should be compelled to do business with everyone. That's my opinion and I will elaborate. Whether it's legal or not to refuse business to someone depends upon what laws exist. Apparently in the case under discussion, refusal to photograph a ceremony for a gay couple is unlawful discrimination. I think it's immoral no matter what the laws are.\n \n It is my opinion that the greater social good can be served to outlaw certain forms of discrimination. In my opinion, one ought to be able to eat anywhere, get a room for the night, have a drink, go dancing, buy a house, rent an apartment and get hired somewhere without regard to one's gender, race, ethnicity, religion, etc and in my opinion sexual orientation. Phyllis and her ilk may or may not think it's OK to refuse a meal to gays, I can't tell, because they are slippery. \n \n I thought anti-discrimination laws applied to \"housing, employment, public accommodations, and public services\" or something like that. I don't think wedding photography falls into that category and I originally stated that I don't have a problem with someone refusing to photograph a same-sex marriage. \n \n Others posted and asked how it would feel if they refused a black, Jewish, mixed-race or Christian couple. I must admit that my sense of fairness bristled at that in a way it did not for the gay couple. That seemed blatantly wrong! I surprised myself. Perhaps my own homophobia was acting up. My disparate feelings sure seem prejudicial. I don't know - that's for me to wrestle with and work on. \n \n However, I still think there should be some circumstances where one can simply refuse to do business with others. How would I feel if I was refused the business? I would be really upset and hurt. Do I think it is wrong-headed for Christians to pass judgment on a same-sex ceremony and view it as something that offends their morals? You bet. I think it is royally ####ed. I think anyone who makes a call like that is scum and certainly not Christian. Should it be illegal? I am not so sure. \n \n It looks like both parties in this battle are really stupid. Was this a photographer whose business is so flush they can refuse business? Even if they so simple-minded that they think same-sex is immoral or something, perhaps they ought to pick their moral battles on something more substantial. Not sure how your religious belief applies to your clients. One demographic you DON'T want to miss out on in the wedding biz is homos. They throw the best and most expensive parties as everyone knows. \n \n As for the couple. After learning of the bigotry of the photographer, who would want them? They would undoubtedly do a terrible job. Tight-assed puritans and creativity do not go hand in hand in my book. Are there no other photographers? Again, it comes to picking battles. This seems like small potatoes to go to court over. At least to me. But my bias is probably showing again - I think the wedding hullaballoo is mostly over the top nonsense - and couples place far too much importance on the wedding over the marriage.",

   "One problem here may be that a lot of people tend to view participation in weddings as a volunteer/service oriented thing, even in cases where those doing the service get paid. I think that's often how wedding coordinators and ministers are viewed, for certain. In other words, not everyone looks at this situation and thinks of it in terms of someone \"hiring\" someone or \"doing business.\" Now that may very well be wrong--it probably IS business, really. But I've known people who got married and they had a photographer they knew who did the pictures, but they still paid them--but it wasn't like a business deal. They gave them money 'for their troubles', you might say. With weddings there seems to be a fine line there--some take an approach that would view these things as business deals, some not. You can argue that it's a business deal when a coordinator does a wedding, or you can argue that they are helping with the wedding and they'll probably get some \"appreciation money\" as a result. Now this case seems to have been more like a business deal (for the article), but I think some people still tend to think of weddings in that way. That said, the more I think about it, Foundit may be right when he says someone unwilling to photograph ANYTHING like this that's legal should probably not be incorporated. The photographer can still have his or her religious belief that it's wrong. That doesn't have to be given up if he abides by the law even though the law is supporting something he morally disagrees with.

   "Sorry, I honestly didn't get the humor. But I understand now where you were coming from.\n \n \n \n Well, Of course we should try to get to the root of prejudices and end prejudice. No one here disagrees with that, I suspect. But there's nothing wrong with being willing to examine it and make sure it really is prejudice or religious belief. The need to end the roots of prejudice, while important, is beside the point of whether or not religious people should be forced to do things against their religion if it's BECAUSE of their religion they don't want to participate. Where the rub lies for me is that, in the eyes of the whether someone can be sued, no one seems to CARE whether the non-participation is out of prejudice OR genuine religion belief. And we should care, because many people who feel this way aren't doing it out of prejudice. They're doing it because of their religious belief. I know you probably aren't going to believe that no matter what I say, but it's true.\n \n \n \n Reforming religion itself is another topic entirely. In terms of why religion gets \"special status\" and people have the freedom to not have to forced to go against their religion, it DOES get special status under our constitution--the very first amendment ensures freedom of religion. If you want to change the constitution, you can try to get the 1st Amendment pulled, but you have a lot of work to do and a difficult uphill climb to make that happen.\n \n \n \n That's right. We value religious freedom in the states. That's the way it is, by our constitution, and if you don't like religious freedom, it's probably not the place for you. Though Dawkins is probably one of the worst people you could quote in terms of having credibility on matters regarding religious freedom, as he's known for his irrational axe to grind, in a big way.\n \n \n \n In cases where it really does, yep.\n \n \n \n And I think that's a good thing. I'd RATHER you look at evidence, logic, and the people in question than lump everything into one basket, automatically placing religion and prejudice rather than being open to the reality that people really do have genuine religious views on this, or assuming it's always prejudice when it might not be, in fact.\n \n \n \n If it is rooted in genuinely religious reasons, then yes. Churches do this all the time, without having to be sued. It may not be the RIGHT thing to do--it's certainly not what my religion consists of--but otherwise you may be forcing religious people to do something against their genuine religious belief. \n \n \n \n That's irrelevant. You're always going to be able to find some exception or hole (no matter how large or small) in the Bible. It's not like the issue of marriage and same-gender people having relations is generally considered an absent issue in the Bible. It's generally understood that it IS dealt with. That apologists have come up with other interpretations of these passages is beside the point. As long as there is a strong interpretive bent going on that this is a moralistic issue, then it is. There is NOT a strong interpretive bent going on that the issue of black people is a moralistic issue. Or misogyny. So those examples don't fit here nearly as well.\n \n \n \n The work to reform the religion if you want to. That's a separate issue.\n \n \n \n \"Than other sins?\" So if religious people gave them ALL equal weight you'd be ok with that??? :) You're basically arguing that, because one gets more attention than the other as a moralistic issue, that you should be able to force people to go against that belief. That's a pretty poor basis on your part. All religion would have to do is start seeing the OTHERS as moralistic and put equal attention on them, and your problem is solved! \n \n \n \n It's also part and parcel to how religion works in some cases. But you continue to refuse to be open to that reality. But since when is INDIVIDUALITY in religion grounds to refuse religious freedom? What committee determines the allowable Biblical interpretations, in your thinking? How many verses do you need before you grant religious freedom to not be forced to participate in an event that goes against one's religion?\n \n (And you can consider those either rhetorical OR non-rheotorical, I don't care.)\n \n \n \n Foundit, you keep bringing up other moralistic issues as if each isn't approached by it's own merits and consequences in religion. \n \n (And the funny thing is, there certainly ARE examples of people who refuse to take part in divorce-related activities due to their religious beliefs, which apparently Foundit doesn't realize. Wonder what percentage of divorce lawyers are practicing evangelical Christians? And a lot of pastors won't marry couples with one of them having been divorced.)\n \n \n \n No, that's not how religious freedom works. You don't tell churches \"you can't be a church!\" if there's a moral issue that keeps them from allowing people to worship with them for some reason. (And before you jump to the \"that's-a-church-so-it's-different\" response, remember there is NOTHING--NADA--in the constitution indicating that the 1st Amendment is limited to just CHURCHES. Religious freedom is broader than the church doors.) You don't tell pastors \"get out of the ministry\" if one of them won't preach at a church that has a lot of adultery going on among the congregation. (These are real-world things that I know of that have happened, btw, Foundit, before you go acting like this never happens in \"THEIR BACKYARD\". emoticon_rolleyes ) You don't tell a photographer to go photograph an FLDS wedding or get out of the business altogether, if he strongly objects to oppressive weddings and marriages. Well, at least you SHOULDN'T. People should be able to have religious principles in their lives if they want, outside of the church doors.\n \n \n \n Again (and I've already dealt with this), that's an issue that can cause HARM. It's not causing harm for someone to not be forced to be the picture-taker of an event his beliefs don't allow him to participate in; photographers are indeed a dime a dozen.\n\n \n This is all wrong. First, yes I know the U.S. has freedom of religion in its Constitution, as do other countries. This is not the only right that matters. IT doesn't trump all other rights. A religious person can decide who to marry or not, based on many different factors. The photographer is offering a service open to the whole public. He/she can't discriminate. \n \n You're arguing it's not prejudice, exclusion, discrimination. You're arguing it's ethically or legally right, when it's not. Simply invoking religion, doesn't make it correct, everything else about the situation being equal. That's irrational. I was watching the news the other night. Polygamy is in the news because of that situation in Texas. A religionist was pointing out a verse in the book of Mormon, that he claims makes it morally right for an old man to marry and impregnate a girl under 16. Everything else in the world is immoral, it was said. Religion says so. That's all they feel they need to know.\n \n I don't think most of those opposing gays always believe religion can be invoked to make something right, usually only in the case of treating gays poorly. Hmmm...I wonder why that is?",

I would say most Christians would recognize that as a moral truth that is absolute, i.e., that it is absolutely wrong to murder such that one ought not to ever do it.\n \n Anytime someone says \"you ought to do this\" in a moral context, they are appealing to a moral standard, and thereby implying that absolute truth exists, and that morality is not relative.\n \n \nThe problem with your statements is that you purposely avoid statements like \"always\" or \"never\" or \"sometimes\". You avoid acknowledging that there is such a thing as DIFFERENT SITUATIONS with DIFFERENT RULES.\n\n No, I realize that there is context. But what I, as a moral absolutist, would say is that in every single moral situation there is an absolutely right answer. \n \n \nPeople who are accused of believing in \"relative truth\" are typically not given credit for those instances that they do believe in the existence of an \"absolute truth\". And because the people who make the accusations have assigned the label of \"you cannot believe in any absolute truth\", you automatically rely on your own strawman argument...\n\n No, what I say is that it is logically inconsistent to say that truth is relative, and then make absolute truth claims. What I say is that it is logically inconsistent to deny the existence of absolute moral truth, and then make absolute moral truth claims.\n \n I do not deny that whether something is moral or immoral depends upon the context of an individual scenario. What I deny is that there is no absolutely right answer within each individual scenario because there is an absolute moral law that covers it.\n \n \nYou set up your own strawman label, and then rip it apart like it means something, when it doesn't...\n\n You are not going to get far with me by suggesting that I am using words without any meaning.\n \n \nDo you believe \"thou shalt not kill\" never has an exception?\n\n No, that would have many exceptions. What I would disagree with is that \"thou shalt not kill\" is an absolute moral imperative. \"Thou shalt not murder,\" the proper translation of the Biblical commandment you have indicated, is an absolute moral imperative, and it is always wrong to commit murder without exception.\n \n \nAgain, you resort to vagueries to ignore the fact that it IS POSSIBLE for somebody to believe that ONE situation has no \"absolute morality\", while another situation DOES have an \"absolute morality\".\n\n I am not being vague at all. Every scenario with moral implications will have an absolutely right answer. If it is any other way, how do you suggest we would know which moral scenarios do have absolutely right answers, and which scenarios do not? On what basis would that be distinguished? If you can come up with a basis, you would prove my point rather than disprove it; for the basis you would assert would itself be an appeal to an absolute moral standard of some sort which tells us what moral scenarios have absolutely right answers and which do not. If I could draw a chart, I would.\n \n \nStrawman.\n Can you show me somebody who has said there is NEVER ANY \"absolute morality\"?\n\n You can follow this exchange if you want, paying especially close attention to #46.\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=308845&postcount=36\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=308851&postcount=39\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=308857&postcount=42\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=308859&postcount=44\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=308864&postcount=46\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=308866&postcount=47\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=308869&postcount=49\n \n \"I'm right, you're right, no one's wrong, everyone has truth, and everyone's individual truth is true for them.

You seem to have indicated that you believe at least some moral claims are absolute. So what moral claims are those and on what do you base them?\n \n \nAnalysis of the situation, vice listening to some multi-thousand year old book filled with inaccuracies and contradictions...\n \n And can you hear the illogic of your approach?\n It's like saying \"These overturned cups have balls in them with \"moral absolute\" or \"relative morality\" written on them. We cannot see what is in the overturned cup, so since we must assume them all \"moral absolutes\".\n\n Absolute moral truth exists. I deny that morality is relative in any circumstance. I think you and I are using the term \"moral relativity\" in different ways. Let's take situation X. By moral relativism, I mean that X is neither morally right nor morally wrong; that there is no truth to the question \"Is X morally right?\"\n \n If I'm not mistaken, it seems you are using \"relative morality\" to simply denote that the morality of a scenario depends upon the circumstances or facts. That cutting one's lawn would not be immoral, but cutting one's throat just might be. This is not at all what I mean by moral relativism. There is a correct answer to the question \"is it moral to cut one's lawn\" and the question \"is it moral to cut one's throat?\"\n \n Now, if that's not exactly what you mean, I'm afraid I'm going to need you to clarify what you mean by \"moral relativism\" because I don't quite understand what you are saying.\n \n \nSuch an argument may be effective against somebody who claims moral absolutes NEVER exist, but against one who claims SOME moral absolutes exist, it's meaningless.\n\n It's not meaningless.

The only possible omniscient source is God, and we can know truth because God has elected to communicate through various means to man.\n\n The definition of \"truth\" is given above.\n You have included so many personal beliefs and personal definitions here that it isn't even really worth debating.\n I disagree with so many of the standards and definitions that you just established out of your own personal belief.\n \n I have a dining room chair that sits in my dining room.\n God's existence, nor his confirmation is necessary to address that.\n \n \n \nWhere do you suggest we get moral absolutes from, then? You seem to have indicated that you believe at least some moral claims are absolute. So what moral claims are those and on what do you base them?\n\n The irony of this conversation is amazing.\n YOU want to pull \"absolute truths\" from a group of people who had a \"moral\" and \"loving\" God that endorsed slavery, commanded genocide, advocated misogyny, ...\n And the \"info\" that we get about this \"God\" came from people who claimed to talk to \"God\" and \"burning bushes\". Who told stories of \"floods\" that have long since been refuted by science. Who told story sequences which puts earth's age in the range of \"thousands\", when science proves it wrong.\n \n And you try to talk to me about \"where do you suggest we get moral absolutes from?\"\n \n Part of the problem is you're talking like we need to GET them from some place in the first place. Like somebody needs to \"give\" them to us.\n I find that a ridiculously false assumption in the first place. We have reason. That is as good of a place to start as any...\n Surely a lot better than just cause some long dead people told me so...\n \n \n \nAbsolute moral truth exists. I deny that morality is relative in any circumstance.\n\n All you do with that statement is insist that anybody who disagrees lacks a credible foundation.\n Insist that the world truly is black and white.\n While I would agree that SOME absolute moral truth exists, to deny that any \"morality is relative\" is just plain absurd.\n \n \n \nI think you and I are using the term \"moral relativity\" in different ways. Let's take situation X. By moral relativism, I mean that X is neither morally right nor morally wrong; that there is no truth to the question \"Is X morally right?\"\n\n Fine.\n Take my example above about Jane and exercising.\n Morally, what's the right thing for Jane to do?\n Or is it \"morally relative\"? Jane's exercising \"is neither morally right nor morally wrong\"?\n \n \n \nIf I'm not mistaken, it seems you are using \"relative morality\" to simply denote that the morality of a scenario depends upon the circumstances or facts. That cutting one's lawn would not be immoral, but cutting one's throat just might be. This is not at all what I mean by moral relativism. There is a correct answer to the question \"is it moral to cut one's lawn\" and the question \"is it moral to cut one's throat?\"\n\n You're throwing a third option into the mix not discussed immediately above.\n The existence of Amoral options.\n \n Regardless, all you're doing is insisting on \"correct\", and \"correct\" being an absolute without acknowledging grey areas.\n \n \n \nIt's not meaningless. For someone to say that some morality is absolute and some morality is not, they are going to need to provide some basis of differentiation. That statement alone won't justify itself is what I am saying.\n\n The same could be said regarding a position of \"all morality is absolute\".\n \n \n \nI don't quite get what you are saying here. I gave an example of a moral absolute, that one ought never to murder another person. I do not see what you mean by how moral absolutes can be contradicted, since it is my argument that they cannot.\n\n And I am baffled by your response.\n Moral absolutes CAN be contradicted.\n Whether you find the counter arguments as significant or credible is another issue.\n \n \n \nbhbcu64 made the claim that only fanatics believe in the idea of objective truth. Sure, he made this claim in an abortion forum in the context of a discussion on abortion, but that statement, on its face, is a rejection of objective truth. And in my other discussions with bhbcu64, I (and many others) have concluded that he rejects that moral truth is absolute. I'm not sure you're going to be able to clarify his meaning since you have not read the entire context. Only bhbcu64 can clarify this to the extent it needs clarification. I, for one, would be relieved if I have understood him incorrectly. But I'm sad to say that I do not believe that I have.\n\n More feedback required from bhbcu64, which is his/her perogative.",

Her paid exercise coach may insist \"WORK OUT\", while her husband may tell her to \"go to sleep. you've earned it\".\n\n When we ask whether it would be moral for her to do A or B, we are asking whether those options conform to the moral law. Abstractly considered, both of these options would be morally right because neither of them violates the absolute moral standard. Just because a situation presents opposing choices does not mean that all the choices cannot conform to the moral law.

Were I to bother defining those terms, I suppose you could (and would) say that those words don't have meaning as well. I am not going to continue to do this because it is a waste of time and because I happen to believe you know full well what I am asking and why.

If not, I think it is pretty clear already that to you everything is relative.\n \n \nStill meaningless.\n\n I'm glad you thought that my definitions and illustrations were chocked full of objective meaning. I'm also glad you agree with me that abortion is immoral and ought to be prohibited.\n \n See, you didn't define your words either, and thus this interpretation I have given it is evidently legitimate.\n \n Communication is impossible at this imbecilic level.\n \n \nCounter question: A group of Cambodian people are escaping the clutches of the Khmer Rouge.

You're misunderstanding the material that you pasted. What it means is that the word can be translated SEVERAL ways, and murder is ESPECIALLY the way it is usually understood. This is very common in translating semitic languages--words can be a number of possibilities, and sometimes judgment calls have to be made based on context and overall writing (the rest of Exodus, for instance) to ascertain which way the word should be taken in a given instance. But you're taking it as if it basically means (in the text of the passage) \"ALL OF THE ABOVE\", but ESPECIALLY so-and-so. Since THE TERM especially means 'murder', that's the more likely way to correctly translate this in the passage. Tell you what ... since I know you aren't going to consider MY opinion on this, don't take MY word for it. Look up other words on the lexicon site you linked to. See how many have multiple things listed (like the case of what you pasted), and reasonably ask yourself if, in all those cases, ALL the meanings apply when the word appears in text.

The case you gave is even MORE helpful because it doesn't just give multiple ways to translate it, but also tells us one is ESPECIALLY favored.\n\n It isn't an issue of \"especially favored\".\n That's a false presentation of the accurate situation.\n \n Like in the example, \"All of the food is good, especially the beef\". Obviously, the beef is \"especially\" good.\n But my point is that ALL OF THE FOOD, and NOT just the beef, is good.\n \n Likewise, while \"murder\" may or may not be a \"favored\" application, it is MORE than just \"murder\" that is illegal.\n Killing is likewise.\n \n \n \n2.) As an aside, please drop the 'brick wall' approach in your posting here. I think some people are getting tired of you arguing everything into the ground that you have some disagreement with. There is nothing wrong with agreeing to disagree on something. If you cannot do that re. peripheral issues like this, perhaps Steeeeve was right on in his approach of no longer discussing things with you.\n\n If you can elaborate on where I am a \"brick wall\", and what would be not a \"brick wall\", that would be helpful.\n Otherwise, I will have to chalk this up to your accusation being like \"Steeeeve\" in his false claims regarding me lying, and similar absurd misrepresentations.\n \n Without that said, I suspect the same \"brick wall\" criticism could apply to anybody who believes in \"absolute morality\", as that obviously poses a \"brick wall\".\n Or anybody who believes that homosexual conduct is wrong.\n \n I really think you are the pot calling the kettle black at this stage...\n \n \n \n3.) I've covered this before with you, please drop the tact that I'm dishonestly accounting your position. I'm pointing out that your position, even the way YOU account it, is really one that is an \"all of the above\" approach, with more attention being given to one (because of the term \"especially.\") I'm not claiming \"your position states anything as so-and-so\" at all. But by it's very nature, your take on this amounts to what I'm saying; you just don't apparently realize it.\n\n I refuse to drop an accurate assessment of your behavior.\n \n I've covered with you before that you need to stop misrepresenting the positions of others.\n Amusingly enough, when Steeeeve challenged me to a debate without \"insults\", I returned the challenge to also add that the debate had to be free of strawman arguments. With much significance, he refused.\n \n I think the ultimate point in all this is that some people on this message board search for any nitpicking excuse to avoid an open and honest discussion, free from misrepresentation.\n \n The point I made (which you are trying to intimate that you are discussing) was NOT regarding \"all of the above\".\n Let me repeat this. The point I made was NOT regarding \"all of the above\"\n It WAS regarding your claim \"You argue as if the word \"especially\" isn't even there.\"\n That is completely false.\n \n Every single one of my discussions has taken the word \"especially\" into account.\n \n It would seem more accurate to observe that YOUR interpretation argues as if the word \"killing\" isn't even there.\n You never really explain WHY that word is actually IN the definition if it's not applicable.",
