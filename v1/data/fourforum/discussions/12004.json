   "Every time I return from Europe (which is three times), I get into religion. It happened again after Iceland. I found this book at Kroger's and read it, trying to make sense of God, Jesus and the Resurrection. \n \n Who was Jesus? Was He both God and man? Were the miracles real? Is the Resurrection fact or fiction? \n \n Jesus said, \"I am the vine.\" He said, \"I am the gate.\" He said, \"I am the way, the truth and the life.\" \n \n The life of Christ is told in four gospels. Mark's gospel came first. Mark knew Peter and wrote his gospel based on Peter's account. Peter was in Jesus' inner circle. \n \n Mark's gospel influenced Matthew and Luke. Matthew was a disciple. Luke was Paul's physician. The first three gospels are similar. John emphasizes Jesus' deity. \n \n The biographies of Jesus differ from modern biographies. Parts of Jesus' life are skimmed over or omitted. Matthew has ties with the Old Testament. Mark focuses on the last week of Jesus' life. Luke underscores His humanity. John presents Jesus as the preexistent Word made flesh. \n \n Paul encountered Jesus on the road to Damascus. Paul's New Testament letters predate the gospels. He attests to Jesus being the Messiah who died for sins and rose from the grave. Paul writes that other people saw the resurrected Jesus. The idea is that Christ's followers will be resurrected as He was, that victory over death is achieved through faith. \n \n Jesus' miracles took different forms. Some were psychosomatic like driving demons out of Mary Magdalene. Others showed power over nature like walking on water and turning water into wine. Jesus demonstrated His power over death by bringing Lazarus back to life. Colossians 1:16 states that Jesus created all things. He had power over all things. \n \n Even more revealing is that Jesus forgave sinners. Such authority was associated with God. \n \n What can we say about God? God is all-powerful, or omnipotent. He is everywhere, or omnipresent. He is all-knowing, or omniscient. He is eternal and infinite. He is the uncreated Creator. The New Testament implies that Jesus was all of these. \n \n God is Spirit in the Old Testament. He is flesh in the New Testament. Jesus fulfilled 300 Old Testament prophecies. Zechariah 9:9 prophesied that He would enter Jerusalem on a donkey. \n \n The seven days before Easter Sunday are called Passion (suffering) Week. Jesus rode into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, had the Last Supper on Thursday and was crucified on Good Friday. Sinless Jesus bore the sins of all humanity. \n \n What of the Resurrection? Did the disciples steal Jesus' body? If there was a Resurrection, was it physical or spiritual? The American Bible Society concedes that the Resurrection is unbelievable while \"resonating with inner truth.\" \n \n No one saw Jesus come back to life even though the Bible records post-Resurrection appearances. Jesus appeared to His disciples and to Mary Magdalene. He appeared to Peter and James. He appeared to Paul. He appeared to 500 people at once. \n \n There are no appearances in Mark. Matthew and Luke have a few. John has the most. \n \n Jesus ascended into heaven from the Mount of Olives. He sent The Holy Spirit. The Pentecost, a painting by Jean Restout, is reproduced. \n \n If a Creator, responsible for the \"surge of energy\" which exploded as the Big Bang, suspended the laws of nature to manifest Himself or Itself in the space/time continuum, then the Incarnation, miracles and Resurrection are true. \n \n The Resurrection is the cornerstone of Christianity. According to the Bible, we must believe to receive God's grace. It is then that we become children of God. \n \n Do I believe? Of course! Hallelujah! Thank you! Jesus!! \n Jesus Paid My Debt http://jimcolyer.com/@tracks/9/lofi.mp3",

And you will understand that it isn't God punishing you forever; you will clearly see all of the times He placed people like me in before you to share the truth which you spent a lifetime responding to as you have right now. You will condemn yourself by rejecting His free gift which was accomplished by Jesus on the Cross.\n \n And I am only one messenger of many. By no means am I special. But like all believers, we realize that what we have received is more precious than pure gold and it is the only gift worth sharing when all is said and done in life. Eternity is forever after all, this life is nothing more than a wisp of wind. I understand how you feel though, and i'm sorry you're willing to risk eternal security by denying what is so freely offered in a spirit of unconditional love.\n \n You say, Certainly if God exists I may have to account for my behavior, what you fail to understand is that nothing you can do either now or then can cover up or account for your sins. That's why Jesus had to take the sins of man upon Himself in order to sanctify and purify us. I am saved not because of anything I have done, but because of what Jesus did. And you're right that I too am a sinner who is by no means perfect just because I'm saved. But I've been washed because of what He did, and not because of my own merit at all. I just want that to be clear to you so that you wont think that you're going to be having some meeting with God where these issues will be discussed and debated. Here's how Jesus put it.\n Jhn 10:3 The watchman opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.\n \n Jhn 10:4 When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.\n \n Jhn 10:5 But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger's voice.\"\n \n Jhn 10:6 Jesus used this figure of speech, but they did not understand what he was telling them.\n \n Jhn 10:7 Therefore Jesus said again, \"I tell you the truth, I am the gate for the sheep.\n \n Jhn 10:8 All who ever came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.\n \n Jhn 10:9 I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. [fn] He will come in and go out, and find pasture.\n \n Jhn 10:10 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.\n \n Jhn 10:11 \"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.",

I know that in Psalm 22, David supposedly has a vision of Christ on the cross. I think all the prophecies are very flimsy and open to interpretation. Yet they may all be true. I have wrestled with science and religion for a long time, trying to reconcile the two in my own mind. It is hard to accept 7-day creation as anything but poetic mythology. Yet there is always a grain of truth even in mythology. The Big Bang is accepted by science as real. Perhaps certain aspects of the Genesis story can be fit into the ideas of modern science like God's omnipotence and man's fall and need for redemption. The book I reviewed did not touch on a second coming of Jesus, but I have entertained the notion that if the universe is 13.7 billion years old and in middle age, Jesus might return in another 13.7 billion years. At that time, he might harvest souls in other galaxies or parallel universes if they exist. \n Jim",

   "\n hey Unkerpaulie\n A number of fulfilled prophecies are listed in the book, The Life of Christ. I do not have them with me now. I know that in Psalm 22, David supposedly has a vision of Christ on the cross. \n Jim\n\n \n \n Now, if you read Pslam 22 in context, it has nothing to do with Jesus what so ever. Mind you, the words were used by the unknown author of the 'Gospel of Matthew', but using the words later on is not a prophecy of Jesus 1000 years later.\n \n The literary device that attempts to compare Jesus and David does not mean there is a prophecy in the Psalms",

   "[QUOTE=Archangel;334366]I understand you think it's all a myth sinjin. And yet you back pedal by saying, but if he does exist, what He would do. And you will understand that it isn't God punishing you forever; you will clearly see all of the times He placed people like me in before you to share the truth which you spent a lifetime responding to as you have right now. You will condemn yourself by rejecting His free gift which was accomplished by Jesus on the Cross.\n \n \n Anthony321\n A \"gift\" is suppossed to be \"free\" to begin with. If not accepting a gift has negative consequences what is to be said of the bearer? It's just bad manners to present a gift to someone then expect compenstion for said gift. And when compensation is not given, serious consequences result. For eternal salvation all one has to do is believe that Jesus is the one true God who died for our sins. There are those who can't believe the Jesus story because they don't believe in Snow White or Sleeping Beauty either. It's just another fairytale. For all those who won't believe it because they believe in the other \"One true God\", it would be impossible for them to accept this \"gift\" as well. So did Jesus really die for the sins of mankind or did he die only for those who are willing to call him God? \n \n In real life it matters what kind of a person you are. A God that needs to be acknowledged,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, has serious issues.",
