   "One Laptop Per Child (sorry, I can't post links yet. Just Google OLPC.) says that about 20 US states are thinking of buying their cute little kiddie laptops and all the free software and stuff that comes with it. Maine and Georgia went ahead without them using off-the-shelf laptops. \n \n Has anybody had any contact with such programs? How are they going?\n \n Does anybody know which states? (When Mitt Romney was Governor of MA, he said they should do it. He doesn't talk about that now.)\n \n Does anybody care?",

What is a starving kid who's probably never been to school and who doesn't have electricity going to do with a laptop?\n\n \n My question exactly. Liberal nerds on a rampage. A child in Nigeria needs you to send $139 to a food relief agency, or send it to catholic charities and sponser a bunhc of kids. They do NOT give a rats behind whether they have internet access or not. They have better things to worry about.\n \n I do believe these people mean well, but there are all kinds of stories about well meaning westerners blowing money on some of the dumbest stuff you can imagine when trying to provide aid to developing nations. The US once sent a half million dollars worth of sewing machines and training materials to starving people in a region of africa where they have no power, no textile industry, and shipping has to be done by 4wd truck because there are no roads that are suitable for freight. The plan was that they were going to start some kind of cottage garmet making industry.",

Sure you can keep most of Africa and Asia below the subsistence level by pumping in food aid every so often and not offering other help, but surely we want all nations to develop?

Now not only are laptops not provided, they are not allowed. \n \n I can see the logic to the OLPC program, but it is not reality based. There have been many sucessful programs in africa to help kids. Programs where a trade or marketable skill are taught have worked out wonderfully. Programs that increase general education lovels have been dismal failures. There is just no point. It is not like developed parts of the world where increased education=increased opportunity. These kids are not mobile, are not going to wander off to college, and quite frankly are one hell of a lot better off if they can learn to fix diesel engines, cast metal, or farm more effectively.",

   "Some children don't need laptops because they're not going to use them. It is apparent to me that in the future, people will attain higher skills to meet job requirements and that computers will be a major part of life, but to say that every child needs one is wrong. I don't know of any hotel maids or sharecroppers that go home after work and get on the computer. \n \n It may be more of a scam or a business deal for some computer sales company that has paid politicians for support of such action.\n \n Be careful what you send to groups that say they send aid to the poor, starving people in other countries. I've heard that as much as 80% of what you donate goes to the group's operating expenses...including nice shiny cars for the fund-raisers to ride around in, fancy hotels and retreats.\n \n I prefer to give support directly to the person in need. I guess the starving children in Africa will never see any of my money.",

   "Claiming that aid organisations are corrupt is a nice excuse to do nothing to help people. Fortunately most reputable charities publish figures for how much of their money is spent on operating expenses. A bit of googling suggests a typical figure is more like 20% admin (including fundraising) and 80% on the aims of the charity. Here, for example, are the accounts of Oxfam UK:\n http://www.oxfam.org.uk/resources/downloads/reports/report_accounts06_7.pdf\n \n Obviously Oxfam is a special case because it makes money from selling new products in its shops, and this incurrs extra costs but you can see that the vast majority of Oxfam's outgoings are on its stated objectives.",
