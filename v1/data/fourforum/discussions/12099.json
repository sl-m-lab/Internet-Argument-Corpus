   "You misunderstand my response, maybe I wasn't clear. His question was why would someone choose to be gay. My response was third person and basicly stated that it is hard to say why someone else would choose something.\n\n Your reply is a thorough cop-out to intellectual honesty.\n It's virtually \"religious\" how you will insist on your position, even though you can present no credible reason for why you would hold to it.\n \n \n \nYou are right however that you could demonstrate (not prove) that someone made a choice by giving an example. Some examples of this would be those that were \"cured\" (for lack of a better word) by reparative therapy, if homosexuality had a biological cause reparative therapy wouldn't work.\n\n That is thoroughly false on multiple levels.\n First, a biological link to alcoholism has been definitively proven. On the level of heredity, and the level of biological addictiveness of alcohol.\n That doesn't mean people can't stop drinking...\n Depression has been found to have a biological link, yet it can be resolved by cognitive therapy.\n \n Furthermore, people don't really stop being gay via reparative therapy.\n Spitzer did a study on \"ex-gays\". At first, he tried to find them on his own. But he could not.\n He then did something that flies in the face of modern scientific method. When evaluating a therapy's success, you DO NOT ask the company claiming the therapy to hand-pick what examples they want you to look at.\n But Spitzer had no choice, so he did it anyways.\n \n EVEN THOUGH the reparative therapy companies got to hand-pick their results, his study found over-whelmingly that most of the \"reparative therapy\" patients STILL had sexual attraction for the same gender.\n They were still gay.\n \n Spitzer went on to note that he did not get a good evaluation of where their ORIGINAL sexual orientation lay. Those that claimed not to be attracted to the same gender could have started out as bisexual or bisexual-straight (on the Kinsey scale).\n \n \n But to approach your claim another way, what kind of situation do we have then?\n 1) Since gays cannot just \"choose\" to be straight, being gay is obviously not a choice.\n 2) As you put it (even though I've already shown that to be flawed), you argument would claim evidence that it's not \"biological\".\n \n Ergo, since it's not biological or choice, what is it then???\n \n \n \nAlso, an internet search will provide examples of people who say they chose their sexual orientation, gay and straight. However validity is tough to determine.\n\n I can provide you with a few examples of \"reformed gay\" reparative therapy GROUP LEADERS who reverted back to homosexuality as well.\n Just because John Doe can be quoted as saying \"I'm cured\", when the reparative therapy advertises the claim, doesn't mean that he's still \"cured\".\n \n \n \nI know the reasons I chose to be hetrosexual...\n\n This is quite the amusing claim.\n You claim to know \"the reasons you chose\" to be straight.\n Yet in the poll I gave, you claim to not know the age that you supposedly made the choice at...\n Proposes rather a conundrum of a more poignant detail which you supposedly cannot remember, yet other aspects you claim to remember...\n \n \n \n... but no I don't know why someone else would chose what they do. Unlike you I don't pretend to know what other people are thinking.\n\n < snort <\n To put that in context, he's making that comment with respect to the fact that I acknowledge that being gay or straight IS NOT A CHOICE.\n \n \n \nI chose and continue to choose to be hetrosexual for many reasons, some I'll share and some I won't.\n\n Considering you deny that sexual ORIENTATION is truly about sexual ATTRACTION, your claim is rather shallow.\n For real people, we can't choose WHO we are attracted to. We either have a sexual attraction, or we don't.\n It's just that simple.\n A person can't MAKE themselves sexually attracted.\n They can't make themselves NOT sexually attracted either.\n They can SUPPRESS an attraction, which Spitzer reports is what happens with \"ex-gays\", but that is ACTUALLY further proof that you cannot CHOOSE who you are attracted to...\n \n \n \nA poll that 3 people responded to is hardly conclusive.\n\n You say that one hour after I post that poll.\n The numbers will grow.\n Just out of curiousity, when more and more people come forth and tell you that their sexual attraction was NOT a choice, are you still going to insist that \"choice\" was a possible reason for their sexual orientation?\n Or, with choice being eliminated, are you going to say \"They must have had a biological reason for being gay?\" ???",

For example; every young person who experiences sexual confusion or curiosity about homosexuality feels a tremendous amount of personal guilt, even though we live in a time when homosexuality is openly expressed and accepted by society. \n \n The argument that the guilt is due to social mores and fear of rejection doesn't fly because I personally experienced those fears before coming out to my moslem parents when I accepted Jesus, yet I felt no guilt at all about my decision. I knew in my deepest person that what I had found was eternal light and eternally right. My fear of rejection was based on my love for my parents and concern that they wouldn't appreciate the value of what I had discovered in Christ. \n \n But the guilt of young people with sexual identity confusion is based on knowing that what they're feeling is wrong and unnatural. The question we must ask is why do they feel that way if homosexuality is right and normal? I believe this is why when most kids finally accept homosexuality as a lifestyle, it's due to 2 reactive events. 1) they associate with other kids who excuse their feelings of guilt by misdirecting them by fallaciously blaming it on the fear of social rejection, and #2) they become angry and militant in their dedication to justifying their new found identity as a proud gay person. \n \n They become hateful and consider anyone who disagrees with their chosen lifestyle as an enemy who hates them when we have no personal animus toward individual homosexuals at all. Our beef is with the lifestyle itself and the moral depravity which it represents. \n \n Since you mentioned what religious folks believe, let me say that we consider homosexuals victims of the spiritual battle we know humanity is steeped in. We don't hate homosexuals at all, they are being deceived and we can clearly see that so we have empathy and sympathy for them.\n \n But that doesn't mean we can openly accept their lifestyle as right and normal because the Gods Word condemns it. Although I do accept the homosexuals in my life with love and friendship. I neither judge nor condemn them in any way. But when asked how my christianity conflicts with their lifestyle, I honestly share the gospel and explain that whether we be straight or gay we are sinners in need of salvation. And that it isn't their homosexuality which will separate them from God, but their rejection of what Jesus did on the cross when He died for all of our sins equally. Whether straight or gay, we're all in the same boat with God as sinners who fall short of his glory. \n \n And one more spiritual law that tells me that homosexuality is a choice is that God is greater than any sin of the flesh which afflicts mans fallen nature if we will only trust Him to deliver us from it. And I have personally experienced spiritual deliverance from sexual proclivities which I too was unable to control at the time. And you know what Holly? I too insisted that I couldn't control the urges I had. To me, they were totally natural and yet I felt guilty and knew they were wrong just like the homosexual does regarding their sexual choices. So there is a way out of every sexual sin. I know there is and because of that we are responsible for trusting the one power who is able to complete us in His image which was why He created us in the first place; for perfect fellowship as recipients of His unconditional love.",

Get married, and they get to screw their loved one heterosexually all they want.\n \n But for gays, NO sex EVER.\n Unless we pretend to be straight, get caught in a loveless marriage, and to people like Archie that's \"not sin\" and somehow preferable... emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Archangel, the reason most young men or women feel this way is because they either have been raised by predominately religious families. I have a friend who is gay. He has been ever since he attend the LDS church. Same church and all. He was afraid, very afraid of the fact that his parents would reject him. He was the only child after all and really had no one to confide in. He wouldn't even confide in me, who has been his friend since 10 years old. The reasons I think is the fear of rejection and humiliation. Since some people in this country are religious to some degree and have this deep rooted belief that men should be with men and women shouldn't be with women, it's very hard to come out of the closet so to speak. Nowadays my friend has already come out and told his parents the truth. His father rejected him while his mother was a bit more supportive. He ended up moving out of his house. I haven't seen him in a while. I sure hope he is doing alright. It's too bad about his parents, I don't know if I can say I blame religion. For some people it seems, helps them find out who they are, while for others it is nothing but a nightmare. Personally, I'd rather not believe in a thing, too much conflict with being a human IMHO.",

We can't help attraction, we can only feel or not feel it.\n \n Now, I do not know how prevalent bisexuality is: studies (e.g. Kinsey's famous one) suggest that the distribution among men at least tends to be bimodal. It is skewed towards the zeros and sixes (where a Kinsey 0 is \"perfectly\" straight while a Kinsey 6 is \"perfectly\" gay) with fewer men in the middle. Women seem to be less bimodal, with a higher incidence of bisexuality. However, even gay men who register as being in the 5-6 range are likely to have had some heterosexual experience.

And unlike you, who will undoubtedly respond to this post with no OBJECTIVE refuting evidence but plenty of insults as you dismiss my conclusions, I will support what I say with clinical evidence from an objective study. Here's the abstract from the study:\n A Systematic Review of Mental Disorder, Suicide, and Deliberate Self Harm in Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual People\n Posted 11/07/2008\n \n Michael King; Joanna Semlyen; Sharon See Tai; Helen Killaspy; David Osborn; Dmitri Popelyuk; Irwin Nazareth\n Author Information\n \n INFORMATION FROM INDUSTRY\n ADHD in Adults: How common is it? \n Dr Lenard Adler explores the symptoms and prevalence of ADHD in adults. \n Watch video presentation\n Abstract and Background\n \n Abstract\n \n Background: Lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people may be at higher risk of mental disorders than heterosexual people.\n Method: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of mental disorder, substance misuse, suicide, suicidal ideation and deliberate self harm in LGB people. We searched Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Cinahl, the Cochrane Library Database, the Web of Knowledge, the Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, the International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Sociological Abstracts, the Campbell Collaboration and grey literature databases for articles published January 1966 to April 2005. We also used Google and Google Scholar and contacted authors where necessary. We searched all terms related to homosexual, lesbian and bisexual people and all terms related to mental disorders, suicide, and deliberate self harm. We included papers on population based studies which contained concurrent heterosexual comparison groups and valid definition of sexual orientation and mental health outcomes.\n Results: Of 13706 papers identified, 476 were initially selected and 28 (25 studies) met inclusion criteria. Only one study met all our four quality criteria and seven met three of these criteria. Data was extracted on 214,344 heterosexual and 11,971 non heterosexual people. Meta-analyses revealed a two fold excess in suicide attempts in lesbian, gay and bisexual people [pooled risk ratio for lifetime risk 2.47 (CI 1.87, 3.28)]. The risk for depression and anxiety disorders (over a period of 12 months or a lifetime) on meta-analyses were at least 1.5 times higher in lesbian, gay and bisexual people (RR range 1.54-2.58) and alcohol and other substance dependence over 12 months was also 1.5 times higher (RR range 1.51-4.00). Results were similar in both sexes but meta analyses revealed that lesbian and bisexual women were particularly at risk of substance dependence (alcohol 12 months: RR 4.00, CI 2.85, 5.61; drug dependence: RR 3.50, CI 1.87, 6.53; any substance use disorder RR 3.42, CI 1.97-5.92), while lifetime prevalence of suicide attempt was especially high in gay and bisexual men (RR 4.28, CI 2.32, 7.88).\n Conclusion: LGB people are at higher risk of mental disorder, suicidal ideation, substance misuse, and deliberate self harm than heterosexual people.\n \n Background\n \n Lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people appear to be at greater risk than heterosexual people of mental disorders and suicidal behaviour.[1,2] LGB people are subject to institutionalised prejudice, social stress, social exclusion (even within families) and anti-homosexual hatred and violence and often internalise a sense of shame about their sexuality.[1,2] Lifestyle factors such as alcohol and drugs misuse also increase the risk of morbidity[1] as well as suicide attempts.[3] Deliberate self harm (DSH) is intentional self poisoning or injury, irrespective of the apparent purpose of the act. DSH is one of the leading causes of acute medical admissions in the UK. Incidence rose steadily from the mid 1980s to the late 1990s with a peak incidence rate of 400 per 100,000 per annum,[4] one of the highest in Europe. However there is evidence of a steady drop in suicide in England (and other developed countries) since 2000.[5] The evidence on mental health of LGB people is inconclusive partly because of the difficulty of defining or recruiting samples that are representative of all non-heterosexual people. Specific methodological obstacles include variation in the definition of sexual orientation, DSH and mental illness; difficulty in achieving random samples; reliance on participants' recall; unwillingness of people to be open about their sexual orientation; lack of information on sexuality in suicide victims who are part of psychological post mortem studies; the complexity of choosing appropriate comparison groups and poor or absent adjustment for confounding influences such as substance use and personality factors.\n \n There is an urgent need to quantify the risk for mental disorder, DSH and suicide in LGB people, to understand the precipitants and to examine the efficacy of prevention efforts. There is also a need to make a judgement about the quality of the evidence available. We undertook a systematic review of the world literature on risk of mental disorder, substance misuse, DSH, suicidal ideation and suicide in LGB people. These parameters are the main ones reported in the literature and provide a comprehensive picture of mental health and well being.Log In Problems\n \n Because you must sign up to receive the article, I'm posting the complete abstract for fairness as not all of it is particularly negative.\n \n \nHi Holly, ask yourself a few key questions about the fairly consistent journey all gay men take before proclaiming what they are publicly and you must admit that there is something more going on than just a natural affinity to people of the same gender. For example; every young person who experiences sexual confusion or curiosity about homosexuality feels a tremendous amount of personal guilt, even though we live in a time when homosexuality is openly expressed and accepted by society. \n \n The argument that the guilt is due to social mores and fear of rejection doesn't fly because I personally experienced those fears before coming out to my moslem parents when I accepted Jesus, yet I felt no guilt at all about my decision. I knew in my deepest person that what I had found was eternal light and eternally right. My fear of rejection was based on my love for my parents and concern that they wouldn't appreciate the value of what I had discovered in Christ. \n \n But the guilt of young people with sexual identity confusion is based on knowing that what they're feeling is wrong and unnatural. The question we must ask is why do they feel that way if homosexuality is right and normal? I believe this is why when most kids finally accept homosexuality as a lifestyle, it's due to 2 reactive events. 1) they associate with other kids who excuse their feelings of guilt by misdirecting them by fallaciously blaming it on the fear of social rejection, and #2) they become angry and militant in their dedication to justifying their new found identity as a proud gay person. \n \n They become hateful and consider anyone who disagrees with their chosen lifestyle as an enemy who hates them when we have no personal animus toward individual homosexuals at all. Our beef is with the lifestyle itself and the moral depravity which it represents. \n \n Since you mentioned what religious folks believe, let me say that we consider homosexuals victims of the spiritual battle we know humanity is steeped in. We don't hate homosexuals at all, they are being deceived and we can clearly see that so we have empathy and sympathy for them.\n \n But that doesn't mean we can openly accept their lifestyle as right and normal because the Gods Word condemns it. Although I do accept the homosexuals in my life with love and friendship. I neither judge nor condemn them in any way. But when asked how my christianity conflicts with their lifestyle, I honestly share the gospel and explain that whether we be straight or gay we are sinners in need of salvation. And that it isn't their homosexuality which will separate them from God, but their rejection of what Jesus did on the cross when He died for all of our sins equally. Whether straight or gay, we're all in the same boat with God as sinners who fall short of his glory. \n \n And one more spiritual law that tells me that homosexuality is a choice is that God is greater than any sin of the flesh which afflicts mans fallen nature if we will only trust Him to deliver us from it. And I have personally experienced spiritual deliverance from sexual proclivities which I too was unable to control at the time. And you know what Holly? I too insisted that I couldn't control the urges I had. To me, they were totally natural and yet I felt guilty and knew they were wrong just like the homosexual does regarding their sexual choices. So there is a way out of every sexual sin. I know there is and because of that we are responsible for trusting the one power who is able to complete us in His image which was why He created us in the first place; for perfect fellowship as recipients of His unconditional love.\n",

   "Your reply is a thorough cop-out to intellectual honesty.\n It's virtually \"religious\" how you will insist on your position, even though you can present no credible reason for why you would hold to it.\n\n \n An interesting analysis Dr. Fraud, considering the only position I've taken is that nobody has been able to prove if sexuality is a choice or biological. A position you claim to be able to prove false but have yet to do so. You have provided opinion, theory, and conjecture but as yet no proof.\n \n \nThat is thoroughly false on multiple levels.\n First, a biological link to alcoholism has been definitively proven. On the level of heredity, and the level of biological addictiveness of alcohol.\n That doesn't mean people can't stop drinking...\n Depression has been found to have a biological link, yet it can be resolved by cognitive therapy.\n\n \n As you said, each of your examples has a difinitive biological link. A link that has not been discovered as of yet in sexuality.\n \n \nSpitzer did a study on \"ex-gays\". \n\n I am not familiar enough with Spitzers work to comment on it. I'll have to get back to you on the specifics. Did Spitzer find any examples of people who's sexuality remained changed after repairative therapy?\n \n \nI can provide you with a few examples of \"reformed gay\" reparative therapy GROUP LEADERS who reverted back to homosexuality as well.\n Just because John Doe can be quoted as saying \"I'm cured\", when the reparative therapy advertises the claim, doesn't mean that he's still \"cured\".\n\n \n Agreed, but it could also mean that the person in question changed his/ her mind.\n \n \nThis is quite the amusing claim.\n You claim to know \"the reasons you chose\" to be straight.\n Yet in the poll I gave, you claim to not know the age that you supposedly made the choice at...\n Proposes rather a conundrum of a more poignant detail which you supposedly cannot remember, yet other aspects you claim to remember...\n\n \n I also can't say exactly what date I chose to start cutting my hair short, however I can say difinitivly that it was my choice. I'm not sure why not being able to remember the exact date of a choice makes the choice any less valid.\n \n \nTo put that in context, he's making that comment with respect to the fact that I acknowledge that being gay or straight IS NOT A CHOICE.\n\n This kind of thing would be what I was talking about when I said \"Unlike you I don't pretend to know what other people are thinking.\"\n \n \n \nConsidering you deny that sexual ORIENTATION is truly about sexual ATTRACTION, your claim is rather shallow.\n\n \n Actually, I don't seem to recall ever denying that. What I have suggested is that attraction is not the only thing that determines sexual orientation. \n \n \nFor real people, we can't choose WHO we are attracted to. We either have a sexual attraction, or we don't.\n It's just that simple.\n\n \n Maybe not everyone is as shallow as you. Haven't you ever become attracted to a person after knowing them for a period of time? Have you ever not liked someone based on a first impression and then grown to like them after learning more about them?

A position you claim to be able to prove false but have yet to do so. You have provided opinion, theory, and conjecture but as yet no proof.\n\n I have presented plenty of evidence. You have ignored it.\n Testimony of experts. Anecdotal evidence from this message board. (8 say \"not a choice\", and you're the only one who thinks you had any \"choice\").\n Logical evidence based on situations in reality.\n \n And on the flip side, you have presented ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE that \"choice\" is somehow a deciding factor in sexual orientation.\n None whatsoever.\n \n This is a common debating technique amongst religion folks. They present a preposterous idea that they have no means of substantiating. As in ZERO.\n Easy evidence contradicts them.\n \n So the technique they use is to attempt to cast doubt on the dominate position. ANY means of doubt. And then they try to pretend that one option is just as credible as another.\n But the truth is that there is MOUNDS of evidence showing a genetic link for homosexuality.\n NO evidence saying homosexuality is a \"choice\".\n \n Look. I realize the game you are playing. And more importantly, OTHERS see the game you are playing.\n You can continue to parade around with no clothes and insist you're wearing great arguments, but when you're the only one \"sticking\" to your position, it's pointless.\n \n \n \nAs you said, each of your examples has a difinitive biological link. A link that has not been discovered as of yet in sexuality.\n\n Actually, the \"alcohol\" link is pretty analogous because the same type of evidence has been shown for both.\n And I could even use your argument for the ALCOHOLISM situation.\n Don't people CHOOSE to pick up a bottle and drink?\n \n And going a step further, if a person can choose NOT to drink, wouldn't that mean it is NOT biological?\n Whoops! Wasn't that a copy of the argument YOU tried to make to deny the biological aspect of homosexuality?\n \n Look. I could parade out a LONG list of evidence showing a CLEAR biological link, and you would just turn around and lie claiming I haven't shown any.\n I get that.\n And with that said, if there is any other poster who wants to see the biological evidence, just let me know.\n \n \n \nI am not familiar enough with Spitzers work to comment on it. I'll have to get back to you on the specifics.\n\n Yeah. I won't hold my breath...\n If you do actually look at it, keep in mind the context I am talking about.\n If homosexuality WERE supposedly a choice, he would NOT have found what he found.\n \n \n \nAgreed, but it could also mean that the person in question changed his/ her mind.\n\n But if we look at the ACTUAL STATEMENTS from these people, you'll see that they admit they never changed in the first place.\n I realize it may be convenient to just make stuff up, but it just plain doesn't work in a discussion to try and find the facts.\n \n \n \nI also can't say exactly what date I chose to start cutting my hair short, however I can say difinitivly that it was my choice.\n\n A \"choice\" of sexual orientation would definitively NOT be on par with a trivial thought like \"cutting hair short\".\n Furthermore, I'm not asking for a \"date\".\n I talked about WHAT AGE the person was when that \"choice\" was supposedly made.\n I am asking for a YEAR that the \"choice\" was made. A \"choice\" that would supposedly be made just once (unless you are going to say you have chosen to be gay in the past).\n \n Look. You're not fooling anybody. I don't know why you continue.\n \n \n \nThis kind of thing would be what I was talking about when I said \"Unlike you I don't pretend to know what other people are thinking.\"\n\n There is no \"pretending\" when you ASK people the question, and they tell you \"No. I never chose to have the sexual orientation that I have.\"\n That is me RELAYING what other people have told me...\n \n \n \nActually, I don't seem to recall ever denying that. What I have suggested is that attraction is not the only thing that determines sexual orientation. \n\n What happened is that I pointed out sexual orientation is also about attraction. Not just action.\n You started obfuscating the point here.\n http://www.4forums.com/political/gay-rights-debates/12071-comparing-gay-rights-civil-rights-3.html#post336316\n \n We can sum this up quite simply.\n Is a gay guy who has sex with men gay? Yes.\n Is a straight guy who has sex with women straight? Yes.\n \n Those were the easy ones.\n The main confusion you try to fester revolves around other boundaries.\n Is a celibate gay guy still gay? Yes.\n Is a celibate straight guy still straight? Yes.\n \n If a guy has sex with a woman, does that make him straight? No.\n If a guy has sex with a man, does that make him gay? No.\n Just because a man can sleep in a garage doesn't make him a car.\n \n Sexual action is a SIGN OF sexual orientation, but it is not a DEFINITIVE one.\n Like I pointed out, just cause most guys masturbates doesn't mean he is \"oriented\" to his hand. We can accurately realize that the hand is just a way of \"getting off\".\n And for guys, there may be methods of \"getting off\" we use, that we WOULD NOT CHOOSE if we had our desired option.\n The DESIRED option is the item that determines sexual orientation.\n \n \n \nMaybe not everyone is as shallow as you.\n\n Let me guess.\n This is another guy who will be complaining that I am \"insulting\" him later?\n Feh!\n \n \n \nHaven't you ever become attracted to a person after knowing them for a period of time? Have you ever not liked someone based on a first impression and then grown to like them after learning more about them?\n\n All these questions are irrelevant to the point I am ACTUALLY making.\n I answer \"yes\" to both, and it MEANS NOTHING about the argument I am making.\n It means nothing to further the argument you are making.\n \n \n \nLet me ask you this: What makes attraction a basis for a civil right?\n\n By that logic, it eliminates religion as a basis for civil right protection...\n And furthermore, you STILL DO NOT COMPREHEND what \"civil right\" means.\n \n VOTING is a civil right.\n Just cause you stick the word \"gay\" in front of it doesn't mean that it is not a civil right.\n Furthermore, isn't voting EXACTLY a choice???\n I CHOOSE to vote Republican or Democrat?\n So, by your logic, the government could DISCRIMINATE on choices in voting options?\n Preposterous!\n \n You still don't understand what \"civil right\" means, even after I gave you the definition.\n You still haven't figured out that \"choice\" is a meaningless aspect of recognizing or ignoring civil rights.",

You can't vote if you are a felon or underage, you can't choose a religion that promotes human sacrifice or polygamy, you can't have a gov't recognized marriage if its with a same sex partner.\n \n \nYou still haven't figured out that \"choice\" is a meaningless aspect of recognizing or ignoring civil rights.\n\n \n Obviously its not meaningless. As I have shown you several times. It is one of many factors involved in determining if a group of people's actions are to be protected. Your continual side stepping of the truth doesn't make this any less true.\n \n Your posts indicate an obvious belief that I am anti-gay marriage. I'm not. I couldn't care less if two men get married or two woman or three men and two women or whatever. What I'm saying is that nobody has a \"right\" to have that marriage recognized by other people or gov't. As a gov't minimalist type I have long advocated gov't getting out of the marriage buisiness entirely (along with many other things they shouldn't be involved in). Gov't has no business giving advantages to married people vs. single people, whomever they're married to.\n Also, it doesn't matter to me why a persons gay or straight other then an interest in how things work. In my opinion finding proof of a biological reason for homosexuality is going to cause more problems for gay people.

Because there are a lot of people who would think its a dumb question to ask if they chose to be poor, considering that they were born and grew up in a family that was poor. \n \n Yet its no secret that lots of these people, through education, hard effort and coaching, none of which is cheap or easy, have changed their financial orientation. And similarly we know of people that grew up in a wealthy family, born rich if you would, yet managed to lose everything they had through habits and behaviors they seemingly aren't even aware of. Some seem to have obsessive, seemingly innate, urges to spend their money in ways that inevitably lead them to poverty. And for many of them these urges are so deep-rooted and primal that no amount of therapy, counselling, pressure or motivation can get through to them to make them change their financial orientation. That's just the way they are. \n \n We also have people that grow up in rich families that adopt at a very early age a propensity to be industrious and thrifty. And we know that many people in poor environments are themselves in the habit of wanting to spend more than they make, even when they barely make any money in the first place. And often both of these types of people never change these traits about them their entire lives. In fact, they are usually found in families where nearly everyone they are related to exhibit these qualities and orientations, either to be frugal or wasteful. \n \n The point is, you can ask any of these people when did they choose to be rich or choose to be poor.

In my opinion that won't be better.\n\n < yawn <\n Being black is genetic, right?\n Racism obviously has a long history.\n Is there any serious effort to try to make black people to be white?\n \n The thing you don't appreciate is that bigotry is typically ignorant. They eschew knowledge, and avoid it when possible.\n Just look at \"reparative therapy\" and what those that are for \"reparative therapy\" have done.\n They have basically stagnated in ridiculous approaches. Utterly ridiculous.\n You've got one previously esteemed \"therapist\" who advocates punching pillows and yelling at the \"parents\" (who aren't there).",

   "Great questions! Would you say that being poor is a choice? Because there are a lot of people who would think its a dumb question to ask if they chose to be poor, considering that they were born and grew up in a family that was poor. \n \n Yet its no secret that lots of these people, through education, hard effort and coaching, none of which is cheap or easy, have changed their financial orientation. And similarly we know of people that grew up in a wealthy family, born rich if you would, yet managed to lose everything they had through habits and behaviors they seemingly aren't even aware of. Some seem to have obsessive, seemingly innate, urges to spend their money in ways that inevitably lead them to poverty. And for many of them these urges are so deep-rooted and primal that no amount of therapy, counselling, pressure or motivation can get through to them to make them change their financial orientation. That's just the way they are. \n \n We also have people that grow up in rich families that adopt at a very early age a propensity to be industrious and thrifty. And we know that many people in poor environments are themselves in the habit of wanting to spend more than they make, even when they barely make any money in the first place. And often both of these types of people never change these traits about them their entire lives. In fact, they are usually found in families where nearly everyone they are related to exhibit these qualities and orientations, either to be frugal or wasteful. \n \n The point is, you can ask any of these people when did they choose to be rich or choose to be poor. And they would, in the majority of the cases, tell you that they never chose. What are we to make of that kind of \"evidence\"?\n\n \n If they gave their money away, they chose to be poor. If they lost their money through incompetence, they had no choice. If they made money through work and effort, then they chose to be rich.\n \n So what? What does this have to do with a choice about being gay? You can choose to be rich or poor, within certain limits depending on your ability and conscience, by how you organise your life. You can't choose to be gay, or choose whom you are attracted to. That's just plain daffy.",

   "A question I have never gotten a straight answer from when debating someone anti-gay.

Hermaphrodites. \n \n So, my logical conclusion actually is rooted in a question based upon this FACTUAL observation,... \n \n a: Since human sexuality typically follows one's \"sex\" and,...\n \n b: Since a human's \"sex\" (male, female, hermaphrodite) is determined by their \"genetics\"\n \n and;\n \n c: If a heterosexual human's \"sexuality\" generally follows the expression of his or her genes,... why then wouldn't a Homo-sexual human's sexuality be also genetic?\n \n To me, it just makes sense that it would be.\n \n In reality, there are extremely HETERO-sexual humans, extremely HOMO-sexual humans and just about everything in between. And so, it is (to me) illogical to dismiss the genetic malady's of hermaphrodites and the likelyhood that they offer proof that sexuality as well as sexual organs are determined by our genetics.\n \n As far as hating gays?

Society has declared a variety of things in the past as \"undesirable\", like Judaism, interracial dating, women voting, etc etc...\n In fact, some people would claim that the opposition or denigration of these groups is more of a \"malady\" than the actual characteristic itself.\n\n \n Your own bias is showing. \n \n While I didn't refer to the dictionary before selecting the word, The definition I was thinking along the lines of was; \n \n 2. impairment of normal physiological function affecting part or all of an organism [syn: illness] [ant: health] \n \n And I already explained my basis,... \"if gays were the norm, I (personally) would have no problem at all with them seeing heterosexuality as being abnormal. Or, as a \"malady.\"\n \n I was trying not to use words like \"abnormal, deviant, un-natural, etc.\" I guess Malady isn't neutral either. \n \n Anyway, bottom line I think sexuality (ALL SEXUALITY) is primarily genetic. And I don't consider homosexuality to be any more of a disease than I do \"hetero\"-sexuality.\n \n I hope that helps clear that up for ya.",
