   "Americans are delivering weapons to Israel. Yes, it's truth. As I know some agreement about weapons delivering between USA and Israel was signed. I think you understand that this is an official agreement! But today US airplane landed in GB with a load of civil destination. Well and later it became clear that there were weapons for Israel on the board of the plane! It's to strange I think. Look, Americans are delivering weapons secretly but they have official agreement! \n To tell the truth this accident proves the fact that the beginning of new Arabs-Israel conflict couldn't happen without Americans. To all appearances the information about provocation for beginning of military operations by Israeli side has certain ground. I'm sure that Israel will never organize it without US support. Americans that much need the reason for war against Iran because the nuclear scandal had eased down. Well, by this way Israel will realize all US instructions striving own interests. And the USA will try to use Israel's progress in war against Lebanon. And of course Iran will be the next after Lebanon because it sends some volunteers (which is supposedly organized by Mossad) for the war against Jews. After it Americans will enter a new war this time against Iran. I hope now you see that the USA is a international terrorist which unleashed the war in Near East!",

I hope now you see that the USA is a international terrorist which unleashed the war in Near East!\nI'm assuming your screen name refers to Ilan Pappe, the Communist Talking Head formerly employed at the University of Haifa...expelled for anti-semitism. Am I correct?\n \n http://www.meforum.org/article/897\n \n [snip]\n \n A final example of Papp\u00e9's distortion concerns the tidal wave of Arab violence that immediately followed the U.N. partition vote in November 1947. On the day after the vote, a spate of Arab attacks left seven Jews dead and scores more wounded. Shooting, stoning, and rioting continued apace in the following days. The consulates of Poland and Sweden, both of whose governments had voted for partition, were attacked. Bombs were thrown into cafes, Molotov cocktails were hurled at shops, a synagogue was set on fire. On December 3, at the instigation of the Palestinian leadership, a large mob ransacked the new Jewish commercial center in Jerusalem, looting and burning shops and stabbing and stoning whomever they happened upon. The next day, some 120-150 armed Arabs attacked Kibbutz Efal, on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, in the first large-scale attempt to storm a Jewish village.\n \n Ignoring this heavily documented historical record, Papp\u00e9 whitewashes this violence as intra-communal clashes \"activated by hotheaded youth on both sides.\" He even makes the mind-boggling claim that this violence had been triggered by the Haganah. Like so much else in A History of Modern Palestine, this is a falsehood.\n \n Does Papp\u00e9 count on the ignorance of the general reader to accept it? Does he expect his peers to give him a pass? That Cambridge University Press purveys this disgraceful work suggests that they just might. It also symbolizes the crisis in Middle East studies.",
