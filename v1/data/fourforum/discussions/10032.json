   "Take this excerpt part way through the paper:\n ================================\n \n Although the basic theoretical foundation for understanding the mechanisms of evolution, the field of population genetics, has long been in place, the central significance of this framework is still occasionally questioned, as exemplified in this quote from Carroll (4), \"Since the Modern Synthesis, most expositions of the evolutionary process have focused on microevolutionary mechanisms. Millions of biology students have been taught the view (from population genetics) that 'evolution is change in gene frequencies.' Isn't that an inspiring theme? This view forces the explanation toward mathematics and abstract descriptions of genes, and away from butterflies and zebras.... The evolution of form is the main drama of life's story, both as found in the fossil record and in the diversity of living species. So, let's teach that story. Instead of 'change in gene frequencies,' let's try 'evolution of form is change in development'.\" Even ignoring the fact that most species are unicellular and differentiated mainly by metabolic features, this statement illustrates two fundamental misunderstandings. Evolutionary biology is not a story-telling exercise, and the goal of population genetics is not to be inspiring, but to be explanatory. The roots of this contention are fourfold.\n \n First, evolution is a population-genetic process governed by four fundamental forces. Darwin (6) articulated one of those forces, the process of natural selection, for which an elaborate theory in terms of genotype frequencies now exists (10, 11). The remaining three evolutionary forces are nonadaptive in the sense that they are not a function of the fitness properties of individuals: mutation is the ultimate source of variation on which natural selection acts, recombination assorts variation within and among chromosomes, and genetic drift ensures that gene frequencies will deviate a bit from generation to generation independent of other forces. Given the century of work devoted to the study of evolution, it is reasonable to conclude that these four broad classes encompass all of the fundamental forces of evolution.\n \n Second, all four major forces play a substantial role in genomic evolution. It is impossible to understand evolution purely in terms of natural selection, and many aspects of genomic, cellular, and developmental evolution can only be understood by invoking a negligible level of adaptive involvement (12, 13). Because all three nonadaptive forces of evolution are stochastic in nature, this conclusion raises some significant technical challenges. It is tempting to think that stochastic processes have no implications for the direction of evolution. However, the effects of mutation and recombination are nonrandom, and by magnifying the role of chance, genetic drift indirectly imposes directionality on evolution by encouraging the fixation of mildly deleterious mutations and discouraging the promotion of beneficial mutations.\n \n Third, the field of population genetics is now so well supported at the empirical level that the litmus test for any evolutionary hypothesis must be its consistency with fundamental population-genetic principles. Grounded in basic Mendelian processes and sampling theory, many of these principles were laid down before the elucidation of the structure of DNA. Shortly after the genetic code was cracked, a series of technological breakthroughs advanced our ability to reveal molecular variation: protein sequencing in the 1950s, surveys of protein variants in the 1960s, ribosomal RNA sequencing in the 1970s, gene sequencing in the 1980s, and whole-genome sequencing in the 1990s. Each of these episodes brought the need for new methods for analysis and interpretation, and in each case the framework was drawn largely from preexisting population-genetic theory. Thus, although we do not yet fully understand the connections between evolution at the molecular and phenotypic levels, we can be confident that the machinery to do so is in place.\n \n Fourth, some attempts to marginalize the contributions of population genetics to our understanding of evolution have pointed to the \"bean bag\" genetics debate that occurred in the middle of the last century (see ref. 14). However, this is a misunderstanding, as the tensions during this period were not about the population-genetic basis of evolutionary change, but about the need to incorporate epistasis into the existing framework, something that population geneticists have now invested heavily in (15, 16). From the standpoint of its phenotypic products, evolution is more than a change in gene frequencies. Organisms are more than the sum of their parts, just as genes are more than the sum of their functional components. But if we are concerned with the process of evolutionary change, then evolution is indeed a change in genotype frequencies.\n \n In summary, population genetics provides an essential framework for understanding how evolution occurs, grounding us in reality by clarifying the pathways that are open to evolutionary exploitation. To quote Carroll (4) again, \"Simplification may indeed be necessary for news articles, but it can distort the more complex and subtle realities of evolutionary patterns and mechanisms.\"\n =======================================\n \n Now that should raise a few hackles around here. Any comments SS, WW, anyone?\n \n And this table is quite interesting.\n \n http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content-nw/full/104/suppl_1/8597/T1",

Thats an article of population epigenetics. An interesting extension of standard pg. WW/SS may find something there to attacke standard Darwinism with. Be warned though quite a bit of simple math is involved.\n \n =========================\n Abstract:\n \n Cytosine methylation is an epigenetic mechanism in eukaryotes that is often associated with stable transcriptional silencing, such as in X-chromosome inactivation and genomic imprinting. Aberrant methylation patterns occur in several inherited human diseases and in many cancers. To understand how methylated and unmethylated states of cytosine residues are transmitted during DNA replication, we develop a population-epigenetic model of DNA methylation dynamics. The model is informed by our observation that de novo methylation can occur on the daughter strand while leaving the opposing cytosine unmethylated, as revealed by the patterns of methylation on the two complementary strands of individual DNA molecules. Under our model, we can infer site-specific rates of both maintenance and de novo methylation, values that determine the fidelity of methylation inheritance, from double-stranded methylation data. This approach can be used for populations of cells obtained from individuals without the need for cell culture. We use our method to infer cytosine methylation rates at several sites within the promoter of the human gene FMR1.\n \n DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism in eukaryotes, where it occurs primarily in the form of 5-methylcytosine (1, 2). Cytosine methylation often is involved in stable transcriptional inactivation, such as in X-chromosome inactivation and genomic imprinting, and sometimes is transmitted through sexual reproduction, producing phenotypic variation (3). In addition, aberrant cytosine methylation patterns are associated with several inherited human diseases, including fragile X (4-6) and ICF (immune deficiency, centrometric heterochromatin, and facial abnormalities) syndromes (7, 8), and many cancers (9). Understanding how methylated and unmethylated states of cytosine residues are preserved through cell division, therefore, will lend crucial insight into numerous biological processes.\n \n ====================================",

No amount of epigenetic change is going to turn a fruitfly embryo into a human.

I most certainly am familiar with symbiosis and other forms of interaction between two species. Humans are NOT symbionts of corn, chloroplasts and mitochond are. Humans are effectively opportunistic parasites on corn who have managed to establish an essential propagative relationship with that species. And to answer your question symbiosis involves mutual adaptation of the two species involved be the relationship one of predator-prey, parasite-host, or mutualism, or even as advanced as endosymbionts. Many such relationships begin as pathological conditions for one of the partners and with the loss of virulence the pathogen becomes less and less upsetting to the host. Eventually mutual benefit may be obtained, but far from always. Its a genetic arms race or a genetics peace race depending on the case involved. There is a vast and growing body of literature for you to study in this area and even though I have been a reseracher in the area I am familiar with at best a tiny corner of it.

Since\n that time, our knowledge of the gene, the diversity of types\n of genes, the interactions among genes, and the organization\n of genes into the networks and hierarchies that regulate\n development has grown enormously. Although still incomplete,\n this burgeoning knowledge of the molecular\n mechanisms that regulate ontogeny compels a continual\n reassessment of the question: How did the diversity of\n forms of life on earth evolve? Darwin resolved this question\n at the ecological level by explaining how natural selection\n would favor the \"fittest\" forms within a specific environmental\n context. The neo-Darwinian synthesis resolved this question\n at the genetic level by showing how the mechanisms\n of mutation, selection, and drift produce the directional\n changes in gene frequencies that underlie the evolution of\n novel forms (Huxley, 1963). The challenge facing the current\n generation of evolutionary biologists is to resolve this question\n at the molecular and developmental levels.\n",

Lets ask you this is the number 3 random? If its buried in a long sequence of numbers which are random can you prove that it IS random? And of course random is a statistical ly defined notion. If I tell you that a gene changed from X to Y and that the result of Y is a trait Z and that Z results in greater survival and reproduction for the Z phenotype relative to say the prior phenotype Q then will you claim that X-<Y was necessarily \"non-random\"? The mutations known in corn are not known to be systematic in their origins. At the given locus the frequency of mutation to the specific form in corn will be relatively low and mutants relatively rare at that specific locus and to the specific phenotype with a higher fitness. VERY FEW of the plants in a given population will undergo this process perhaps 1 in a million or less. And this rate is unlikely to be altered by the mere presense of human beings in the environment. So in effect the mutation is statistically random in that its rare and shows no discernable pattern in individual plants. Now lets ask if the specific mutation in question is equally probable with respect to all other mutations which might occurr. Of course not, its due to chemistry and physics and thus at its base is deterministic and different loci will mutate at different rates and under different circumstances. But its random in the sense of sequences of coin flips being independent. Combinations of mutations are often independent and uncorrelated.\n \n Of course you may have a different concept of randomness, if so please tell us how you would in fact decide if a mutation rate of 1 in 1,000,000 or so is in fact compliant with your definition or else is non-compliant. This will be difficult to discuss here due to notational problems, but feel free to give it a go.\n \n First please tell us how you define \"random\" and then proceed from there to tell us your specific testable criteria. I look foward to your development.\n \n \n Les also said that vitalism is a dead duck in biology.

However none of them so far as I can see negate the existence of natural selection, and the process of VSI is NOT dependent on the variation being random at a given locus, it is of course somewhat dependent on such changes not being correlated but only in a weak sense. For mathematical analysis it is convenient (although not essential) to make the assumption that a mutation at a given locus occurrs randomnly and independently, just as its convenient in error analysis to assume that errors are distributed more or less normally. If such is not the case then there are perfectly good ways to note the resulting errors and if necessary apply new assumptions - although those used to present a large burden of computation prior to the current era of universal computer availability.

   "Let me introduce WW and SS to Hugh Iltis. From WIKI:\n =========================================\n \n \n Hugh Iltis is Professor Emeritus of Botany at the University of Wisconsin, and is best known for his discoveries in the genetics of corn (maize). As a botanist, Iltis served as the Director of the University of Wisconsin Herbarium.\n \n Iltis proved that domestic corn differs by a small number of mutations from a species of teosinte, a family of grasses that grows wild at a few sites in western Mexico.[1] It was once believed that the original wild corn was extinct. Other researchers have since recreated some of the intermediate steps in the evolution of domestic corn from its wild predecessor, and have demonstrated how Native Mexicans may have selected natural hybrids. However, some controversy remains about what steps separate modern domestic corn from teosinte, its wild cousin.\n \n\n \nIltis's discovery is of great importance economically because he identified a source of genetic variabillity that could be used by plant breeders. Some species of teosinte are critically endangered, and all have a very limited range. Through his efforts, Iltis convinced the government of Mexico to devote resources to conservation of habitat for wild teosinte.\n \n Another of Iltis's discoveries occurred in 1962, while he and Don Ugent were on a plant collecting expedition in Peru. Iltis spotted a wild tomato that had never been classified by taxonimists before, which he noted as No. 832. He sent samples and seeds to a variety of specialists in the field, and collected specimens for several herbariums. This wild tomato turned out to be a new species of tomato with much higher sugar and solids content than domestically grown tomatoes. As a source for hybridization with domestic tomatoes, it has been used both to improve the flavor of tomatoes and to boost solids content.[2]\n \n Iltis was born in Czechoslovakia, and left Europe as a refugee when the country was invaded by the Nazis, before World War II. He is an unwavering and uncompromising environmentalist and conservationist, a champion of preserving endangered and threatened habitats to preserve biodiversity.\n\n ================================\n \n Now lets look at a key paper addressing the epigentic transformation (possibly) from teosinte to corn.\n \n This is just the abstract. I can get you PDFs of this if you wish. Glad to e-mail them to both of you. Maybe you could make a case!\n \n \nScience 25 November 1983:\n Vol. 222. no. 4626, pp. 886 - 894\n DOI: 10.1126/science.222.4626.886\n \n Prev | Table of Contents | Next\n Articles\n \n From Teosinte to Maize: The Catastrophic Sexual Transmutation\n Hugh H. Iltis 1\n \n 1 Professor of botany and director of the Herbarium, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53706.\n \n An alternative to the theory that the ear of maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) evolved from a slender female ear of a Mexican annual teosinte holds that it was derived from the central spike of a male teosinte inflorescence (tassel) which terminates the primary lateral branches. This alternative hypothesis is more consistent with morphology and explains the anomalous lack of significant genetic and biochemical differences between these taxa. Maize, the only cereal with unisexual inflorescences, evolved through a sudden epigenetic sexual transmutation involving condensation of primary branches, which brought their tassels into the zone of female expression, leading to strong apical dominance and a catastrophic shift in nutrient allocation. Initially, this quantum change may have involved no new mutations, but rather genetic assimilation under human selection of an abnormality, perhaps environmentally triggered.\n \n \n THIS ARTICLE HAS BEEN CITED BY OTHER ARTICLES:\n \n Gene Conversion Between Direct Noncoding Repeats Promotes Genetic and Phenotypic Diversity at a Regulatory Locus of Zea mays (L.).\n F.

   "**\n I wonder who taught you to read with both speed and comprehension? They failed at the latter and in your hurry to gainsay my post you completely overlooke a word key to its comprehension. That word, if I may 'bold' it for you, is random. If you look again you may spot it, this time. Here's a hint--it is directly infroint of, thus modifying (as per English usage) the term\n \"'random genetic accident', (that is, your \"RM\", with or without your \"NS\"),\" and it is this key term that concerns whether or not 'randomness' in genetic mutation, \"has ever been a factor in speciation\"? Try concentrating just a little bit harder and soon you'll be able to read just like a big person, I promise you.\n \n Also, there is plenty of evidence in terms of direct correlation between rapid organismic adaptation to specific external stimulus, followed by 'a posteriori' discovery of genetic mutation, to show up your 'post hoc, ergo propter hoc' assumption of genetically accidental, random change _preceeding_ environmental stimulus (either directly on the organism itself, or indirectly on it through the direct experience of its forebears). Anything else is simply darwinist mysticism wherebye speculatiuon is held to support the very ideology that spawned it.\n \n \n \n **\n Sez u, but when were you ever right about any opinion?\n\n \n I explained to you previously that Darwinian evolution doesn't insist on random mutation. It demands variation, followed by natural selection. This has been demonstrated in the field and lab. It isn't a controversial issue. There is also no evidence that mutations are anything other than random, and considerable evidence to suggest they are.\n \n What is controversial is your claim that organisms either orchestrate their own evolution, which is absurd as organisms themselves do not evolve, or the evolution of their progeny, for which you lack a mechanism beyond vague and unsubstantiable appeals to The Force of vitalism.\n \n When you grow up to be 1st grader, you might consider an intelligent response instead of your usual asinine twaddle.",

   "And if you want to play those kind of games remember I can reverse the situation and ask that you produce unquestionable empirical evidence for say the vital force or anything else you rest your own arguments on. Since NO empirical evidence is ever unquestionable you will have to concede that your own is also debatable. Scientists love to debate evidence and data by the way its the core job skill.\n\n \n **\n Well, now that you are squirming wrt those lofty pronouncements you guys are always trumpeting from your ivory towers, how about you just comw up with the sort of 'evidence' that is substantial and convincing enough to pass for 'scientific evidence' in any other academic pursuit, from physical science to history to medical science and back again. Just show (in any way that does not demand a leap of faith), that your basic explanatory principle re biological evolution, i.e., RM+NS is actually \"science\", more than just an ideological assumption to back it up. I can do that, so if your notion has any value at all, you should be able to do it. Can you? Will you? Or will we get nothing but a another crock of temporizing? Rember, youy do not have to be metaphysically absolute and conclusive, but you do have to be empirically scientific, and a crock of supposition and assumption IS NOT science.

So it's up to you and your claque of supporters to to prove that random, accidental, entropic genetic change, i.e., genomic system failure, can produce added complexity, productivity, and adaptedness, strictly by coincidence, in any highly complex, productive, biosystem/organism.\n \n If and when you and your pals prove, as opposed to assume, that entropic system failure can bring about genetic mutations that are positive in terms of the organism's productivity, (and not meaningless at best, deterimental usually), OR, until you can prove rather than simplemindedly assume that those new, positive, adaptive, and productive alterations we discover in organismic systems are the actual result of entropic genetic system failure, rather than teleological, systemic and systematic, organismic effort, then you will have earned the right to pompously dictate reality to the rest of us. Can you do that? Will you even give it an honest try? Or will you continue to cover up your mess by spouting hoowy as if it meant something?\n \n Why don't you start your attempt using your own tweosinte example? Go ahead; don't be chicken. We can hardly wait to hear it.\n \n [quoter]\n And how you will propose to distinguish one from the other with high reliability and in a practical sense.\n\n \n **\n Uh, uh. Ball's in your court.

It is your contention, and yours to prove scientifically, that productive, adaptive changes in organisms are in fact due and thanks to accidental and abrupt alterations in their genomic inheritance, (conservation and preservation) system. \n \n Since, prima facie, your claim is outrageously stupid, it is up to you to validate with science, and not just keep shouting it because it suits your ideology.

The best scientists can do is point out that while they have observed evolution working by genetic mutation in the field and lab, and inferred genetic mutation as the source of speciation in the past because no two species have identical genomes, and the longer ago their common ancestor lived the greater the genetic diversity, they have no evidence whatever that epigenetic change alone can be the cause of speciation.\n \n They can't prove it can never be, but if you want to claim it can be, then provide us with an example of it. This isn't just a cheap debating tactic, it's how science works. You insist that some phenomenon no-one has ever observed is real, it's up to you to demonstrate it is real, not up to us to prove you wrong.\n \n You're like those Loch Ness monster people who smugly point out that no-one has proved there isn't one!
