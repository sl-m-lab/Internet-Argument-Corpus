   "The Chicago Tribune says:\n   The end of the Chicago handgun ban \n The 2nd Amendment is about to arrive in Chicago--whichXis good news for citizens who see a need to have a handgun in the home for protection against the city's many criminals. It's bad news for Mayor Daley and other supporters of the existing ban on handguns, one of the most draconian in the nation. Chicago has long behaved as though gun owners don't have any rights. It is probably going to find out they do.\n \n It's hard to think of a compelling reason that the court would say states don't have to respect the right to keep and bear arms. Law professor Ronald Rotunda of Chapman University told me that he gives the Chicago law only a one in five chance of surviving. \n \n The handgun ban had no effect on crime rates, and lifting it wouldn't make our violence problems any worse. But it would give law-abiding citizens a better means to protect themselves. \n",

You can add local to that also :)\n \n Now I suspect Paul is really sweating that since it is already a bar against the Federal powers emoticon_xbouncer",
