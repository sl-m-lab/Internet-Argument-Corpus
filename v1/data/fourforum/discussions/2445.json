   "I'm just curious. What is everyone's definition of Democracy? \n \n Just to save time here is the definition from Dictionary.com\n \n \n 1.Government by the people, exercised either directly or through elected representatives. \n \n 2.A political or social unit that has such a government. \n \n 3.The common people, considered as the primary source of political power. \n Majority rule. \n \n 4.The principles of social equality and respect for the individual within a community. \n \n And what is you definition of a Republic?\n \n Form Dictionary.com\n \n \n 1.A political order whose head of state is not a monarch and in modern times is usually a president. \n \n 2.A nation that has such a political order. \n \n 3.A political order in which the supreme power lies in a body of citizens who are entitled to vote for officers and representatives responsible to them. \n \n 4.A nation that has such a political order. \n often Republic A specific republican government of a nation: the Fourth Republic of France. \n \n 5.An autonomous or partially autonomous political and territorial unit belonging to a sovereign federation. \n \n 6.A group of people working as equals in the same sphere or field: the republic of letters. \n \n \n The reason I ask this is cause everyone says we (America) is a Democracy, but according to our constitution we're a Republic. It sure works like a republic. The only real decisions we get to make as a people, are our representatives. Which is what a republic is. So where does the democracy come in. We believe in the ideals, but what good is that? \n \n So, then we have Constitutional Democracy.\n \n Political authority (I.e., the power of government) is de-\n fined, limited, and distributed by LAW--defined, limited,\n and distributed by a body of FUNDAMENTAL LAW called \"THE\n CONSTITUTION\";\n \n The general voting populace within the society (the voters,\n the electorate) has effective means of doing the following:\n \n Controlling their elected representatives in the gov-\n ernment;\n \n Holding them accountable (answerable, responsible)\n for their decisions and actions while in office.\n \n Now that sounds like America. By the way, this is the best definition I could find in limited time on the internet. I found it on some personal site. That's just a shame in it self.\n \n So let me get this straight. We say we're a democracy. We act like a Constitutional Democracy, but we're officially a Republic. Wow, I don't know about you, but I'm confused. Especially since every natural born American has been told from birth we are a Democracy. America is a land for the people, buy the people. I believe that, but then something like a war comes along and we realize that we really have no power as a people. We really don't have the power to elect our own president. Thanks to the electoral college. The whole system is out dated. \n \n Hello, we have something called computers and telephones now. Most people don't know why we have the electoral college, so let me enlighten you. Back in the day, we didn't have anything like computers or telephones. The best we had were horses, and that can take months. To save time, they came up with a point system. Each state, depending on the size of the population would get points. The more people the more points. That doesn't sound to bad, so what the problem you ask? Let's say NY has 1,000,000 people and 4 points, and PA has 500,000 and 2 points. If in NY the people voted 500,001 for candidate A, and 499,999 for candidate B. Well, A will win the 4 points for NY. In PA they voted 499,999 for B and 1 for A. B would get the 2 points for PA. Now we tally the points, and it seems that A won even though A only got 500,002 votes and B got 999,998 votes. A candidate won by a trailing - 499,996 votes. \n \n So what have we learned today boys and girls? We learned that we say we're a democracy, we act like a Constitutional Democracy, but we're officially a Republic. And we learned that even if you get 499,996 more votes than your opponit. You too, can become the President of the United States\n \n I brought all of this up because this may be the most important presidential election, ever. And I just want to make sure everyone knows this stuff before we go to the polls.",

The thing I think is particularly disturbing about all of this is that a lot of Americans seem to understand that this is how it works. It makes me wonder if the 75% of people who don't vote have finally decided that it does not matter who they vote for, both parties are the same.\n \n I have a good fried I went to college with who is a congressional aid. She called me the other day and said \"I can't be a republican anymore. I have founght it for the last couple of months by telling myself \"it's an election year\" or \"they are just vote trading\" but even if you make excuses for it, that doesn't make it OK\".\n \n I told her not to quit her job, but to stay on as a spy for the libertarians. \n \n Apparently she was sitting in on an insiders meeting for the new medicare prescription stuff, and she reached her breaking point. She finally realised that when you get socialists (the democrats) democrats (the republicans) and the guys who are really in charge of the thing (representatives from the drug companies) all in one room and talking, what you end up with is a bill that is good for both parties, great for the drug companies, and bad for the country.\n \n It is sad to me that America has degraded to the point that it really doesn't matter who you elect, ythey are all the same. What are the real differences between Bush and Kerry as far as their views go? No wonder that are just running negative personal attacks, there are no real issues to discuss. The issues that may actually be important are going to be \"overlooked\" because they are not going to change anything, except perhaps to run us deeper into debt and take more steps to destroy our economy (at least from the standpoint of the guy on the street).\n \n Georged, you are right on target in regards to how our political parties have short circuited the democratic process in America. They have been in power for s long, and passed so many bills that help ensure a two party system, that the odds of us ever getting them out of power are slim to none. \n \n I have always been considered fairly level headed and rational by those who know me. I find it a little disturbing that I am starting to understand the militants viewpoint. I am not stockpiling weapons or building bombs, but I can definatly see the benifit to dragging these folks up aginst the wall and shooting them.\n \n I have long been an advocate of a political revolution in America. As I study such things more, I see now that the protections put in place by our two major political parties make such an event almost impossible. MAybe jefferson was right when he said \"No tyrannical government has ever been made to stop but by force.\"",

   "An early post described our Democratic Republic as out-dated. Not true! The US is technically a Republic for only one reason: The Electoral College. Since the president is elected INDIRECTLY (we vote for electors who promise to vote for a specific candidate in the electoral college) we are a Republic. In fact, the Senate used to work this way, too. The members of the House of Representatives used to decide (vote) who was in the Senate...\n \n Anyway, the reason why our system is not out of date is that it still serves its purpose. The purpose of the electoral college is to make sure that urban voters don't control who is in government. The rural communities have very different needs and wishes that would go un-noticed in a strict Democracy. Populated centers still have a huge impact on national issues and elections. For example, Florida gets 25 electoral votes while Wyoming gets only 3. The number of electors for each state is equal to the number of House of Rep. members that state has in Congress plus two more for the Senators.\n \n In another post, a Canadian mentioned that Canada has looked into a similar system with the same goal in mind....",
