   "**\n \"One species, many genomes\"\n \n \"Adaptation to the environment has a stronger effect on the genome than anticipated\"\n \n \"Faster growth, darker leaves, a different way of branching - wild varieties of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana are often substantially different from the laboratory strain of this small mustard plant, a favorite of many plant biologists. Which detailed differences distinguish the genomes of strains from the polar circle or the subtropics, from America, Africa or Asia has been investigated for the first time by research teams from T\u00fcbingen, Germany, and California led by Detlef Weigel from the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology. The results were surprising: The extent of the genetic differences far exceeds the expectations for such a streamlined genome, as the scientists write in this week's edition of Science magazine.\n \n \n \n Fig. 1: Arabidopsis plants from different geographical origins differ in many traits (the background shows schematically sequence variation in the DNA of these plants).\n \n Image: MPI for Developmental Biology\n \n To track down the variation in the genome of the different Arabidopsis strains, the researchers compared the genetic material of 19 wild strains with that of the genome of the lab strain, which was sequenced in the year 2000. Using a very elaborate procedure, they examined every one of the roughly 120 million building blocks of the genome. For their molecular sleuthing they used almost one billion specially designed DNA probes. \"All together, these probes would have seven times the length of human genome,\" illustrates Weigel the extent of the project. The data were evaluated with several specially designed statistical methods, including a variant of machine learning.\n \n The result of this painstaking analysis: on average, every 180th DNA building block is variable. And about four percent of the reference genome either looks very different in the wild varieties, or cannot be found at all. Almost every tenth gene was so defective that it could not fulfill its normal function anymore!\n \n Results such as these raise fundamental questions. For one, they qualify the value of the model genomes sequenced so far. \"There isn't such a thing as the genome of a species,\" says Weigel. He adds \"The insight that the DNA sequence of a single individual is by far not sufficient to understand the genetic potential of a species also fuels current efforts in human genetics.\"\n \n Still, it is surprising that Arabidopsis has such a plastic genome. In contrast to the genome of humans or many crop plants such as corn, that of Arabidopsis is very much streamlined, and its size is less than a twentieth of that of humans or corn-even though it has about the same number of genes. In contrast to these other genomes, there are few repeats or seemingly irrelevant filler sequences. \"That even in a minimal genome every tenth gene is dispensable, has been a great surprise,\" admits Weigel.\n \n Detailed analyses showed that genes for basic cellular functions such as protein production or gene regulation rarely suffer knockout hits. Genes that are important for the interaction with other organisms, on the other hand, such as those responsible for defense against pathogens or infections, are much more variable than the average gene. \"The genetic variability appears to reflect adaptation of local circumstances,\" says Weigel. It is likely that such variable genes allow plants to withstand dry or wet, hot or cold conditions, or make use of short and long growing seasons.\n \n Such genome analyses of unprecedented details will allow a much better understanding of local adaptation, and this was indeed one of the main reasons for conduction the study. \"By extending these types of studies to other species we hope to help breeders to produce varieties that are optimally adapted to rapidly changing environmental conditions,\" explains Weigel. He is already collaborating with the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines to apply the methods and experience gathered with Arabidopsis to twenty different rice varieties.\n \n How environment and genome interact is also the goal of new, even more powerful methods. While the technology used so far can only identify genes that have changed or are lost relative to the reference genome, direct sequencing of the genome of wild strains will allow the detection of new genes. The plan is to decipher the genomes of at least 1001 Arabidopsis varieties. A new instrument, with which the entire genome of a plant can be read in just a few days, is already available. Still missing are the computational algorithms to interpret the anticipated flood of data.\n \n Researchers from T\u00fcbingen who contributed to the study include Richard Clark, Stephan Ossowski and Norman Warthmann from the MPI for Developmental Biology, Georg Zeller and Gunnar R\u00e4tsch from the Friedrich Miescher Laboratory of the Max Planck Society, Gabriele Schweikert and Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf from the MPI for Biological Cybernetics, and Daniel Huson from the University T\u00fcbingen.

   "**\n \n For more on how darwinist/geneticist proponents of \"bits of stuff biology\" cannot tell the evolution of the cart from the evolution of the horse, [or the evolution of the 'dog' from the evolution of the 'tail', if you prefer],see below--\n \n \"Species Detectives Track Unseen Evolution\"\n \n \"Science Daily - New species are evading detection using a foolproof disguise -- their own unchanged appearance. Research published in the journal, BMC Evolutionary Biology, suggests that the phenomenon of different animal species not being visually distinct despite other significant genetic differences is widespread in the animal kingdom. \n \n DNA profiles and distinct mating groups are the only way to spot an evolutionary splinter group from their look-alike cousins, introducing uncertainty to biodiversity estimates globally.\n \n Markus Pfenninger and Klaus Schwenk searched the Zoological Record database (1978-2006) to pinpoint reports of hidden (cryptic) species both biogeographically and taxonomically, and found 2207 examples. Pfenninger and Schwenk, who are from Germany based at J.W. Goethe-Universit\u00e4t in Frankfurt found evidence for cryptic species evenly spread among all major branches of the animal kingdom. They also found that cryptic species were just as likely to be found in all biogeographical regions.\n \n The findings go against received wisdom that the insect or reptile branches of the animal kingdom are more likely to harbour cryptic species, and that these are more likely to be found in the tropics than in temperate regions. Zoologists should therefore consider factoring in a degree of cryptic diversity as a random error in all biodiversity assessments.\n \n A cryptic species complex is a group of species that is reproductively isolated from each other - but lacking conspicuous differences in outward appearance. Researchers using techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing have increasingly discovered - often unexpectedly - that similar-looking animals within a presumed species are in fact genetically divergent. \n \n As well as highlighting hidden biodiversity among creatures zoologists have already catalogued, the findings have implications for conservation efforts. Another possibility is that pathogens, parasites and invasive species disguised as their relatives may yet remain undetected, representing a potential human health threat.\n \n Article: Markus Pfenninger and Klaus Schwenk, \"Cryptic animal species are homogeneously distributed among taxa and biogeographical regions\" BMC Evolutionary Biology (in press) \n \n Note: This story has been adapted from a news release issued by BioMed Central.\"\n \n at--\n http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070719011423.htm",

This feature may be the presence of a further 'thing' (such as a soul), but it may also be simply the emergence of special relations or principles of organization arising from the complexity of the biological organism. The former kind of doctrine envisages Life as a kind of fiery fluid (animal electricity, life force), that needs pouring into an inanimate body in order for it to become alive. Aristotle (De Anima and De Generatione) is the principal source of a more sophisticated vitalism, holding that the life of an animal consists in its psyche, which provides a principle of explanation determining the morphological development of the organism, by a principle of teleological or final causation. In the 19th century the two great exponents of vitalism were Bergson and the biologist Hans Driesch (1867-1941).\"",

Sokal also noted that, \"Mainstream science has rejected vitalism since at least the 1930s, for a plethora of good reasons that have only become stronger with time.\"[27]\n \n In his book \"Kinds of Minds\", philosopher Daniel Dennett wrote, \"Dualism...and Vitalism (the view that living things contain some special physical but equally mysterious stuff -\u00e9lan vital- have been relegated to the trash heap of history....\" (Chapter 2).[28]\n \n Joseph C. Keating, Jr., PhD, [29] discusses vitalism's past and present roles in chiropractic and calls vitalism \"a form of bio-theology.\" He further explains that:\n \n \"Vitalism is that rejected tradition in biology which proposes that life is sustained and explained by an unmeasurable, intelligent force or energy. The supposed effects of vitalism are the manifestations of life itself, which in turn are the basis for inferring the concept in the first place.

'Explaining an unknown (life) with an unknowable (Innate),' suggests philosopher Joseph Donahue, D.C., 'is absurd'.\"[18]\n \n He views vitalism as incompatible with scientific thinking:\n \n \"Chiropractors are not unique in recognizing a tendency and capacity for self-repair and auto-regulation of human physiology.

[17] Joanne Stefanatos states that \"The principles of energy medicine originate in quantum physics.\"[33] Victor Stenger [32] offers several explanations as to why this line of reasoning may be misplaced. He explains that energy is recognized as matter and exists in discrete packets called quanta. The quanta of EM fields are known to be photons. Energy fields are composed of their component parts and so only exist when quanta are present. Therefore energy fields are not holistic, but are rather a system of discrete parts that must obey by the laws of physics. This also means that energy fields are not instantaneous. These facts of quantum physics place limitations on the infinite, continuous field that is used by some theorists to describe so-called \"human energy fields\".[34] Stenger continues, explaining that the effects of EM forces have been measured by physicists as accurately as one part in a billion and there is yet to be any evidence that living organisms emit a unique field.[32]\n\n \n [edit] References",

   "WW claims that a new paper by Pfenninger and Schwenk (which demonstrates widespread occurrence of cryptic species) somehow argues against evolution. To no one's surprise (other than WW's), it doesn't. \n \n (Cryptic species are populations that are incapable of successful interbreeding due to genetic or chromosomal differences without being phenotypically different. The concept can be a bit murky, because sometimes the lack of differences turns out to be a matter of insufficiently detailed studies. Sometimes the species look alike and can interbreed a bit when placed together in the lab, but normally live apart. Sometimes the two populations can tell each other apart and won't interbreed, and sometimes not. Moreover, nearly all species show some regional variations when examined closely enough.)\n \n Evolutionary biology has shown that many species begin separation by showing genetic and or phenotypic differences and/or restictions in gene flow between local populations. According to our understanding of speciation, species should show all positions along a gradient from barely different to singificantly different, with all degrees of hybridization from completely interfertile through partially infertile, to totally incapable of fertilization. Differences between species or populations can vary from major effects attributable to single genes to effects (both major and minor) attributable to changes in multiple genes. Thus we are not surprised by sister species that are separated only by differences in genomes that do not happen to have major consequences for their phenotypes (i.e., genetic differences without major phenotypic differences). Indeed, the portion of genetic drift explained by neutral theory suggests that there would be a lot of this sort of thing. \n \n Evolution deniers who ignore anything but \"RM&NS\" would of course completely fail to understand this.\n \n Back when it was easiest to see genetic differences in terms of differences in chromosomes, some sister species were discovered that looked identical but which had distinctly different chromosomal arrangements (as seen either in Giemsa banding studies or in chromosome numbers and shapes). Now that geneticists can read whole genomes quickly, it is not the greatest of surprises that they are now discovering some sister species where differences in genes (rather than chromosomes) far outweigh differences in morphology.\n \n Cryptic species (species that the experts cannot tell apart on the basis of their morphology alone) are not uncommon. These closely related species are usually allopatric (physically isolated from each other), which is fine with evolutionary theory. Nothing says that physically separated populations must immediately experience different conditions or quickly adapt differently from one another. \n \n Sympatric cryptic species (morphologically identical but incapable of successful interbreeding) that remain in contact with each other and which are confused into frequent but unsuccessful matings should very quickly (a few hundred generations) evolve ways to tell each other apart. We would expect a few of these, because any slice of time should present at least a few species in early stages of evolutionary divergence. However, if we found a lot of sympatric cryptic species then perhaps we might be wrong in our theoretical understanding (either in expecting quick separation, or that this sort of separation arises a lot more than we think it does, or that we are even more fundamentally wrong).\n \n Pffeninger and Schwenk found 2207 instances of cryptic species out of 771931 cases that were appropriate to finding such species. The instances were nearly equal in all major metazoan taxonomic groups and in all biomes. This alone is, if anything, expected. However, they didn't address whether these cryptic species were allopatrical or sympatrical.\n \n In a study of sympatric versus allopatric origination of cryptic species in bonefish (genus Albula) Colborn et al. (April 2001, Evolution, 55(4):807-820) concluded, \"Despite multiple cases of sympatry, sister-taxa relationships inferred from mtDNA indicate that divergence in allopatry has been the predominant speciation mechanism in Albula.\"\n \n This is unlikely to be the last word on this subject - many more of these sorts of studies should be forthcoming in the next decade or so.",

But here is the point--the paper shows two different genotypes, one shared phenotype, as a fairly common state of affairs. As an example, fish that regular comes into our rivers to spawn each spring is known by the acadian word, gaspareaux. There is no way, outwardly, for anyone, no matter how expert, to discover that gaspereaux are not one distinct species of herring, but two. The alewife and the blueback herring. Only close internal examination yields any phenotypic difference at all, and then only to a trained biologist. Genomes are quite distinct, all the same.\n \n This means that trying to shift 'evolution' from organisms to genomes, as darwinists have done since Fisher et al, claiming that their genomic evolution equates to everybody else's organismic evolution, is, in a word, horsepucky.\n \n \n\n Evolutionary biology has shown that many species begin separation by showing genetic and or phenotypic differences and/or restictions in gene flow between local populations.\n\n \n **\n No, it [genetics, to use the proper expression] has not. Field biology has shown, to the contrary, that organisms begin to differ from one another in the environments they inhabit, first, behaviour next, then morphology, and finally taxonomic classification. Unless some geneticist discovers, as with the gaspereau, that nothing non-trivial is distinctly different between two populations-- except their genetic makeup,-- and insists upon classifying them as two or more distinct species, taxonomically, on that basis alone.\n \n \n\n According to our understanding of speciation, species should show all positions along a gradient from barely different to singificantly different, with all degrees of hybridization from completely interfertile through partially infertile, to totally incapable of fertilization.\n\n \n **\n Meaning that, for darwinism, the only true distinction between species is total genetic incapacity for viable hybridization. Which may be problematic wrt gaspareaux, who seem to breed together, i.e., two species, same place, same time, through scattered eggs and sperm. I do not know any further particulars on this, but I haveto wonder. At any rate, by this genomic determination of taxonomic distinction, dogs, coyotes, and timber wolves are all one species, while gaspareau, apparently, are not. Very confusing, murky stuff, speciation. You end by wondering if the wored, 'species', means anything at all.\n \n More later, maybe.",

The issue is that no darwinist should,--not if he stuck to his darwinian principles. In fact, the entire issue of sympatric speciation, (not just the cryptic form), is antithetical to RM+NS, forcing darwinists to feverishly attempt to to reconcile/rationalise the empirical fact of its existence with its theoretical impossibility, [according to their 'theory'], over all the decades since Fisherian darwinists first began their, \"Modern Synthesis\".\n \n Allopatric speciation they can rationalise in terms of different places representing different \"NS\" operating upon geographically separated, hence physically distinct, 'populations'. N.B.--always rember that darwinian particulate/genomic evolution is ALWAYS a matter of 'populations, NOT 'organisms'. Hence both their \"RM\" and their \"NS\" apply to separate, distinct 'populations', supposedly undergoing immediate and particular \"RM\", aka, \"Genetic Drift\", followed by immediate and particular, \"NS\". BUT--there is no room in that theory for evolution that transpires when one single population, in exactly the same ecosystem, with exactly the same \"RM\"(\"Drift\") and, more importantly, the same \"NS\", for all members, diverges/speciates, 'sympatrically'.\n When this contradiction of darwinist theory in actual populations was first brought to the fore [60's] by Kimura, as 'neutral' theory, [i.e., random genetic mutation [drift] without any \"NS\" involved], it took a while for darwinists to assimilate it back into their theory. But, just as they had done before and would do again, with altruism, symbiosis, punk eek, and on and on, they eventually blew enough smoke and arranged a sufficient number of monkey-house mirrors to make it look like they were actually talking science, instead of cr-p. See-- http://home.planet.nl/~gkorthof/kortho37.htm , in order to understand exactly how they pulled this off.\n \n The central point is still inescapable--there is no 1-<1 mapping, \n genome-<organism, as darwinism, aka, 'genetic determinism', aka, \"The Modern Synthesis\", aka, 'particulate/genomic evolution', requires.

Simply describing the fact of cryptic speciation, especially [but not exclusively, 'cryptic sympatric speciation'], as you did, in no way actually reconciles it with your \"theory\", as you pretend that it does. That is my point. And it is very different from yours.\n \n \n\n Your gaspereau (and thanks for bringing it to my attention) sounds like a good example of a speciation where genetic change is ahead of phenotypic change, instead of the other way around.\n\n \n **\n That's one possibility.

Build up of differences due to mutations, recombination, selection, and/or drift in allopatric populations could be extremely slow and gradual, and could even go partway to speciation and return to one fully interbreeding population, so we should see a lot of those in intermediate conditions of separation. So far, Pfenning and Schwenk's findings fit comfortably within expected evolutionary outcomes, so you are (yet once again) wrong, WW. Bad habit, that. Makes you look a fool.\n\n \n **\n How is it that your 'theory' \"accounts\" for everything and anything seen in nature, supposed to make me, rather than you and your fellow ideologues, look like a fool?\n \n \n\n If numerous patterns of partial speciation aren't seen, it would require going back to the drawing board. In this particular area, a wide range of possible outcomes would not falsify the ToE. However, possible falsifications of the ToE are much easier to come by in other areas, so you are wrong that it is not falsifiable - it is simply a matter of picking appropriate tests. For example, physicists did not look to planetary orbits to help choose between newtonian and einsteinian explanations of gravity.\n\n \n **\n First law of darwinism--The \"ToE\" must always be said to be falsifiable, but must never be falsified. And god knows what the aside on gravity has to do with anything.\n \n \n\n Find me an unquestionable Cambrian rabbit,\n\n \n **\n More stupidity. The infamous \"Cambrian rabbit\" is supposed to show that evolution itself is an historical fact; that is, that their actually is an unfolding, evolving, directional process of biological change over time. This simplistic argument, whatever its rational merits, is fair ball wrt creationists, those who deny evolution as described above. It has absolutely no pertinence wrt to myself and others who fully accept the fact of evolution, as described, but deny the darwinist ideology that pretends to explain that factual historical process. When are you going to wake up and catch on to with whom you are dealing?!?\n \n \n\n In the meantime, what if anything would you take as evidence against EAM?\n\n \n **\n Empirical observation of a pre-existing genetic variation that must, deterministically, lead linearly to a specific phenotypic expression of a trait that would be adaptive given a certain environmental event, an event that is theoretically very possible but as yet never actually experienced by that species of genotype.",

If we are so against such a concept, how come I was taught about it?

Sigh.\"\n \n \"Source: University of Virginia \n Date: July 24, 2007 \n More on: Stem Cells, Lymphoma, Brain Tumor, Immune System, Molecular Biology, Biotechnology \n \n Specialized Cells: A Question Of Identity\n Science Daily - Human development has long been seen as a one-way street. During gestation, stem cells were thought to develop into a succession of ever more specialized cells. As Dr. R. Ariel Gomez has discovered, the final identity of these cells is not as definite as once thought. \"The identity of many cell types is in a constant state of flux,\" Gomez says.\n \n Gomez, a professor of pediatrics who also serves as the University's vice president for research and graduate studies, specializes in the juxtaglomerular (JG) cell. This is a highly specialized cell that in adults resides in the glomerulal area of the kidney and produces renin, a substance that increases blood pressure. Renin is essential for maintaining our fluids and electrolytes at healthy levels.\n \n Working with colleagues Dr. Maria Sequeira Lopez and Ellen Pentz from the Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Gomez tracked the lineage of the JG cell back to its ancestor, a renin-producing progenitor cell that is widely distributed in the embryo. They also discovered that this progenitor cell evolves into a variety of different cell types besides the JG cell, including smooth muscle cells that line the blood vessels and cells that appear in the adrenal gland and other tissues.\n \n Under normal conditions, there are enough JG cells producing renin to ensure that blood pressure remains at proper levels, but these cells alone cannot meet the demand in an emergency. \"We discovered that when the body is threatened and blood pressure drops, those smooth muscle and adrenal cells derived from the renin progenitor return to an earlier type and produce renin,\" says Gomez. \"It is as if they have memory. We're interested in cues in their immediate environment that cause them to revert.\"\n \n Gomez's target is deep within the nucleus of the cell, in the chromatin scaffold that holds its DNA in place. A gene is expressed when the lattice around it opens up and allows the factors that transcribe the gene's formula for a particular protein to come in contact with it. Gomez and his colleagues are working to pinpoint the factors that open the lattice around the renin gene in smooth muscle cells.\n \n In Gomez's view, the plasticity of the renin cells confers an evolutionary advantage. \"It's an efficient way of providing additional renin-producing capacity exactly when it's needed,\" he says. This dual identity also suggests the possibility of new therapies. \"If we can describe the process by which cells revert to their renin-producing ancestor,\" he notes, \"it will open new possibilities for cell-based therapies in general and in the treatment of people with kidney and blood pressure diseases in particular.\"\n \n Note: This story has been adapted from a news release issued by University of Virginia.\"\n \n at-- http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070722110230.htm",
