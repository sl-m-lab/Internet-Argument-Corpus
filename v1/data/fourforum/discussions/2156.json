Why is every word that comes from you an answer unto itself, undeniable proof that you're asking yourself the question \"Why?\". If you didn't doubt, then how can you doubt your ever doubting? Isn't that in itself doubt, or do you doubt that? You could be a program, but then again, if that were true, then what is the point? Where is the meaning to this program and what is it's function? We play games on the computer all the time, and who are we to know that we haven't played god and made the characters real, suspending time with the click of pause and resuming life as soon as we saw fit? Are we just another program, played out by another? So you do doubt, as much as you would like to deny that, you do, and there is nothing to prove otherwise. But the program never doubts its own existence then does it?\n \n Sandy, glad you have \"volumes\" to prove that God exists. If you saw my comment as an attack, then you were mistaken. It was simply a question, because I meant for those who post to give a reason behind their beliefs.",
