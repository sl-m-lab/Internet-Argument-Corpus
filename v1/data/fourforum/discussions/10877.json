   "Click Here To View The Fisherman That Were Called\n \n Will You Be Chosen?\n \n Today's message from GOD came to me last night via Sunday's Gospel (Matthew 4:18-22 see below). Why would GOD call us and then NOT choose us? Remember, GOD knows everything. So when HE calls us HE already knows if we're going to measure up to HIS STANDARDS. So why does HE call us?\n \n First lets figure out why HE didn't choose us. To answer that question we have to ask ourselves one question: When HE asks us to SACRIFICE for HIM how fast did we answer that call? \n \n I'll use myself as the PREFECT EXAMPLE. Last night I couldn't sleep. GOD was giving me this message but I wasn't willing to jump out of bed and start working on it. Even though I knew that was what HE wanted me to do. In my own way, I was telling GOD thanks for the message but I need to get my sleep now. I'll write your message in the morning.\n \n Lucky, for me, HE still wouldn't let me sleep. So after awhile I got up and got to work. I should have done it right away. GOD has to come FRIST. If I had TRUSTED HIM to ALWAYS be RIGHT, I would have known I didn't need any more sleep. I should have TRUSTED HIM to know how much sleep I needed. I should have known HE'D take care of me but I didn't listen to call. I can only pray for forgiveness and learn from this lesson. My hope is that you learn from it too. TRUST GOD and ANSWER HIS call whenever HE asks because someday HE'S going to judge us on how well we listened to HIM.\n \n Now lets talk about the that call. Christ told us about that during his ministry. He talked about a man that wanted to be his follower but first he had to bury his father (Luke 9:59-60 see below). He talked about another man that wanted to be his follower but first he had to say good-bye to his family (Luke 9:61 see below). To help us understand the commitment GOD wants from us Christ indirectly used Elisha as an example to follow (Luke 9:62 see below). When Christ said anyone who starts to plough and then keeps looking back is of NO USE to the KINGDOM OF GOD Christ was expecting the Hebrews, who KNEW the bible better than most of us to think about Elisha's calling. \n \n Elisha's was call by GOD via Elijah (1 Kings 19:19-21 see below). One day Elisha was plowing in the field when Elijah called him to be his assistant. Elisha wanted to first say good-bye to his father and mother and then he would go with Elijah. However, Elijah wasn't going to wait, so Elisha killed his oxen and used the wood from his plow to cook the meat. Then he feed the people and became Elijah's assistant.\n \n Elisha wanted to say good-bye to his parents but he didn't because he put GOD FIRST. I'm sure he could have made a better deal for his oxen and the plow but that wasn't important to him. He found a way to give it to the poor without selling it (Luke 18:22 see below). Elisha gave away everything and followed Elijah. I wonder if Elijah was surprised by Elisha's actions? He shouldn't have been because GOD sent him to anoint Elisha (the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah) to replace him. GOD always knows what HE'S doing. Unfortunately, man forgets how intelligent GOD is. That day Elijah got taught a lesson from GOD. Just a few days earlier Elijah had wanted to die. He was very depressed (1 Kings 19:4 see below) because he thought he was the ONLY ONE LEFT (1Kings 19:9-10 see below). GOD proved Elijah WASN'T the last follower left. \n \n Christ also discussed the cost of being a disciple (Luke 14:25-29 & 33 see below). You have to love GOD more than your family and you have to be willing to carry your own cross. If you decide to become a disciple don't expect to have anything of your own (Luke 9:58 see below).\n \n The apostles also past GOD'S TEST (Matthew 4:18-22 see below) . They were fishing when Christ called them. They dropped everything and went with him. And Christ told them they would be rewarded for it (Luke 18:28-30 see below). \n \n So why does GOD call us if HE already knows we WON'T be able to live up to the standards HE requires? The answer is simple. HE calls us because HE'S A JUST GOD. HE gives EVERYONE a CALL or should I say test. Someday we'll be judged on how we responded to HIS call(s). Thus, MANY ARE CALLED BUT FEW ARE CHOSEN. \n \n \n Matthew 4:18-22 Jesus calls four fisherman\n 18 As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. 19 \"Come, follow me,\" Jesus said, \"and I will make you fishers of men.\" 20 At once they left their nets and followed him. 21 Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them, 22 and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him. Luke 9:59-60 The would-be followers of Jesus\n 59 He said to another man, \"Follow me.\" But the man replied, \"Lord, first let me go and bury my father.\" 60 Jesus said to him, \"Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.\" Luke 9:61 The would-be followers of Jesus\n 61 Still another said, \"I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say good-by to my family.\" Luke 9:62 The would-be followers of Jesus\n 62 Jesus replied, \"No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.\" 1 Kings 19:19-21 Elisha past the test\n 19 So Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen, and he himself was driving the twelfth pair (symbolism for twelve tribes of Israel he would be caring for/farming). Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him. 20 Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah. \"Let me kiss my father and mother good-by,\" he said, \"and then I will come with you.\" \"Go back,\" Elijah replied. \"What have I done to you?\" 21 So Elisha left him and went back. He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them. He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his attendant. Luke 18:22 Sell everything you have and give the money to the poor\n 22 When Jesus heard this, he said to him, \"You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\"1 Kings 19:4 Elijah asks GOD to let him die\n 4 while he himself went a day's journey into the desert. He came to a broom tree, sat down under it and prayed that he might die. \"I have had enough, Lord,\" he said. \"Take my life; I am no better than my ancestors.\" \n 1 Kings 19:9-10 GOD asks Elijah why he was hiding\n 9 There he went into a cave and spent the night. 10 He replied, \"I have been very zealous for the Lord God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, broken down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too.\" \n Luke 14:25-29 & 33 The cost of being a disciple\n 25 Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and turning to them he said: 26 \"If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters--yes, even his own life--he cannot be my disciple. 27 And anyone who does not carry his cross and follow me cannot be my disciple. 28 \"Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Will he not first sit down and estimate the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it? 29 For if he lays the foundation and is not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule him, \n 33 In the same way, any of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be my disciple\n Luke 9:58 Those that answer GOD'S CALL give up ALL earthly possessions and become SERVANTS of GOD\n 58 Jesus replied, \"Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.\"\n Luke 18:28-30 The apostles past GOD'S TEST when they were called\n 28 Peter said to him, \"We have left all we had to follow you!\" 29 \"I tell you the truth,\" Jesus said to them, \"no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God 30 will fail to receive many times as much in this age and, in the age to come, eternal life.\" ",
