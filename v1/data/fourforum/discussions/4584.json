   "\n Thankfully the EU isn't nearly as debt laden as the US or Japan, so it will be easier to recover.\n\n \n There's a big difference in US and Japanese debt. Japan has the ability to service future debt by expanding markets within China and the rest of Asia, where the next economic boom will transpire. The US, having tied itself to Taiwan's can and perpetuating a standard of ME foreign policy we can't afford, severely limited our global opportunities and the ability to service future debt. We're having problems making ends meet at this point in time as our debt and operating deficits sink our currency. \n \n I like the socioeconomic mix of EU countries and their comparative lack of debt with a strong currency. Adding Russian oil and real estate would be a fine combination. The future ability to exploit niche markets combining existing professional/technology strengths with low-cost labor will support higher social costs far better than any single country on its own and as systems and equipment are eventually standardized defense costs will drop like a rock.",

   "Western Europe is experiencing slow growth due to mature markets with a limited population growth causing little demand in new capital expenditures. Combine this with competition from eastern Europe and of course China the chance of Western Europe having new factories and non retail jobs being created in the near term is limited. \n \n Europe unlike North America has a high savings rate and its population (not governments) are not increasing their debt loads to temporarily increase the growth rate at future expense. When the integration of eastern europe and western europes economic markets find a balance the combined nature of western europes financial strength and eastern europes cheaper and generally well educated workforce should continue to allow the EU to be a powerhouse in the future. \n \n Provided that they do not take short term cuts that negatively affect its future economic competiveness.

Far from it, former East Germany is still a major drag on Germany's (and thereby for a large part the EU's) economy.\n\n \n This is true. The slow-down of the german economy is certainly an important aspect of the whole system. But I don`t think all of our economic troubles can be atributed to the german failiure of re-unification. Italy and France are having large troubles as well. And their economies are certainly big enough to be independant of german failiures..\n \n \nAnd now we have 10 new member nations that joined the EU. Those 10 nations are on average much poorer than the average EU country, so they too will be a drag on our economy.\n \n\n \n They are poorer, yes. And they do drag down average GDP/capita and employment figures. But they are also experiencing very rapid growths (with the exeption of on or two new entrant) and job creation figures.

   "Vaclav Klaus, president of the Czech Republic, was recently in Washington to meet with President Bush and release his new book, \"On the Road to Democracy.\" When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and the Velvet Revolution came to Czechoslovakia, Mr. Klaus became finance minister in the new democracy. He became prime minister in 1992, and later president. His market principles replaced communism with freedom and choice; he liberated prices and foreign trade, deregulated markets and privatized state ownership of assets. Communism was dismantled and prosperity came to his country.\n \n But now President Klaus sees an unsettling new challenge: the zeal of Old Europe--France, Germany, Brussels--to impose collective choices on New Europe--Poland, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Ireland. \"Ten years ago,\" Mr. Klaus writes, \"the dominant slogan was: 'deregulate, liberalize, privatize.' Now the slogan is different; 'regulate .*.*. get rid of your sovereignty and put it in the hands of international institutions and organizations.'*\"\n \n \"The current European unification process is not predominantly about opening up,\" he continues, \"It is about introducing massive regulation and protection, about imposing uniform rules, laws, and policies.\" It is about a \"rush into the European Union which is currently the most visible and the most powerful embodiment of ambition to create something else--supposedly better--than a free society.\"\n \n *\n \n The force that is creating these pressures is indeed the European Union. Its constitution must be ratified by all member states; four of the 25 nations have done so, and referendums will be held in France and the Netherlands this spring. If ratified, the EU will become the primary source of legal authority in Europe with \"primacy over the law of member states.\" In other words, the 25 members of the European Union Council of Ministers--not the 750 members of the EU Parliament--will make the laws for 450 million people previously citizens of 25 independent countries.\n \n So what is making President Klaus \"more and more nervous\" about the Czech people's future? His conviction that the authors and enforcers of the new EU Constitution believe:\n \n \u0095 That \"competition is not the most powerful mechanism for achieving freedom, democracy and efficiency, but rather an unfair and unproductive form of dumping.\"\n \n \u0095 That \"intrusive regulation, ruling and intervening from above are necessary because market failure is more dangerous than government failure.\"\n \n \u0095 That \"the premise that government is ultimately a benevolent force, obliged to guarantee equal outcomes by redistributing benefits and privileges between individuals and groups.\"\n \n Could the Brussels bureaucracy, for example, constitutionally impose France's 35-hour work week on the other 24 nations in the European Union? Indeed it could, and with a vote of only 15 of the member states (if they represented 65% of the population of the EU). A state voting \"no\" would have the law imposed upon it.\n \n It seems likely that the European Union intends to centralize decision making in Brussels, while President Klaus believes in \"the inherent morality of markets, in the ethics of work and saving, in the crucial link between freedom and private property. It is not possible (or desirable) to legislate a better world from above or outside.\"\n \n Come to think of it, hasn't this very same debate dominated public-policy decision making in America? Whether the government should have the power to make collective decisions for us or people have the power to make individual decisions for themselves?\n \n It began in the Depression, when capitalism appeared to have failed and it seemed Franklin D. Roosevelt's collectivism would do better. That government-knows-best philosophy pretty much dominated the country--with some respite during World War II and the immediate postwar years--for half a century. In the 1960s and '70s government grew; regulation increased; crime rose while the prison population dropped; schools lowered their standards and limited testing; and the distribution of wealth became more important than its creation. As Lyndon Johnson said, we must accept \"greater government activity in the affairs of the people.\" Richard Nixon's wage and price controls and higher taxes continued the trend.\n \n Then came Ronald Reagan with the opposite view, and the 1980s and '90s saw an America in which liberty was believed more important than equality; expanding markets became more important than expanding government. Welfare was replaced with work, expanded police forces and mandatory sentencing drove crime rates down, education began a return to testing and standards, and the creation of greater individual and national wealth became our economic focus.\n \n President Bush has continued the individualist perspective. With the exception of his steel tariffs catastrophe, he has worked to increase trade. He has reduced taxes to increase individual opportunity and grow the economy. He favors the ownership society--he hopes to expand the 52% of Americans who own stock and the 69% who own their own homes--and believes that Social Security retirement accounts should be owned by individuals too. The No Child Left Behind Act tried to bring higher standards to public education, but this is an area in which the United States still follows the Brussels model--public schools are run by the government, and families are not allowed to choose the best school for each of their children.\n \n Establishment thinking, of course, predicts that individualism will be a catastrophe, but the opposite turns out to be true. Reagan's tax cuts were called--by Republican Howard Baker, no less--a \"riverboat gamble,\" yet they launched a strong economic expansion. His missile defense system was ridiculed by Ted Kennedy as \"star wars\" and his challenges to the Soviet Union denounced as reckless and irresponsible, and yet they consigned communism to the dustbin of history. Sen. Pat Moynihan and Children's Defense Fund president Marian Wright Edelman both predicted that welfare reform would drive the poor deeper into poverty, but it cut the welfare caseload in half and allowed millions of people--mostly women--to go back to work and improve their lives and opportunities.\n \n So as communism disappeared in Eastern Europe and Reagan's philosophy dominated American thinking, individualism has been on the rise. But a nation's belief in individualism is often overwhelmed by a warm and persuasive governmental benevolence that will in the end limit our opportunities. In Europe we see its growing power in Brussels; in America we see it in the current Social Security debate.\n \n Establishment America favors collectivism--the collectivism of public education and our current Social Security, and higher taxes to limit individual choices and increase government choices. So President Klaus's thinking deserves some consideration, for if Brussels and Blue America prevail, our lives will be very different indeed.\n\n Opinion Journal\n \n interesting reading.",

   "Good to see you again fracas. I had allready begun to miss our discussions. \n \n \nVaclav Klaus, president of the Czech Republic, was recently in Washington to meet with President Bush and release his new book, \"On the Road to Democracy.\" When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and the Velvet Revolution came to Czechoslovakia, Mr. Klaus became finance minister in the new democracy.

Now the slogan is different; 'regulate .*.*. get rid of your sovereignty and put it in the hands of international institutions and organizations.'*\"\n\n \n Denmark and Ireland being \"the new europe\"? How weird... Allthough I agree that the neo-liberal winds that blew throughout the world has been challanged lately in europe. Apparantly, de-regulation, privatization and liberalization didn`t deliver as promised.\n \n \n\"The current European unification process is not predominantly about opening up,\" he continues, \"It is about introducing massive regulation and protection, about imposing uniform rules, laws, and policies.\" It is about a \"rush into the European Union which is currently the most visible and the most powerful embodiment of ambition to create something else--supposedly better--than a free society.\"\n\n \n Why should it be about \"opening up\"? EU is not a free trade organisation. A free trade organisation would have been toothless and unable to deliver further economic and social benefits. What we need to do now, among other things, is to intesify the internal market. That requires uniformity, not \"freedom\". \n \n \nThe force that is creating these pressures is indeed the European Union. Its constitution must be ratified by all member states; four of the 25 nations have done so, and referendums will be held in France and the Netherlands this spring. If ratified, the EU will become the primary source of legal authority in Europe with \"primacy over the law of member states.\" In other words, the 25 members of the European Union Council of Ministers--not the 750 members of the EU Parliament--will make the laws for 450 million people previously citizens of 25 independent countries.\n\n \n The EU parliament has never had any real power. In this regard, EU is still far from a federal entity like the US. We still retain national soverignity through our nationally elected officials.\n \n \nSo what is making President Klaus \"more and more nervous\" about the Czech people's future? His conviction that the authors and enforcers of the new EU Constitution believe:\n \n * That \"competition is not the most powerful mechanism for achieving freedom, democracy and efficiency, but rather an unfair and unproductive form of dumping.\"\n\n \n Good to hear. Competition can only create efficiency (at best). Freedom and democracy doesn`t come from stripping individuals of their democratic political powers. \n \n \n That \"intrusive regulation, ruling and intervening from above are necessary because market failure is more dangerous than government failure.\".\n\n \n Government failiure can be rectified more easily than market failiures, as government failiures are commited by individuals and parties, whereas market failiures are created by structures.\n \n \nThat \"the premise that government is ultimately a benevolent force, obliged to guarantee equal outcomes by redistributing benefits and privileges between individuals and groups.\".\n\n \n What did he expect when a majority of \"old europe\" is being governed by social democratic parties with socialists and enviromentalists as supportive partners?\n \n \n Could the Brussels bureaucracy, for example, constitutionally impose France's 35-hour work week on the other 24 nations in the European Union? Indeed it could, and with a vote of only 15 of the member states (if they represented 65% of the population of the EU). A state voting \"no\" would have the law imposed upon it.\n\n \n The Brussels bueracracy? I guess they mean our democraticly elected national governments. Because they are the ones calling the shots on these issues.\n \n \nIt seems likely that the European Union intends to centralize decision making in Brussels, while President Klaus believes in \"the inherent morality of markets, in the ethics of work and saving, in the crucial link between freedom and private property. It is not possible (or desirable) to legislate a better world from above or outside.\".\n\n \n Perhap Mr Klaus is pre-dominantly concerned about his own political influence and power. Good riddance I say.\n \n \n\n Come to think of it, hasn't this very same debate dominated public-policy decision making in America? Whether the government should have the power to make collective decisions for us or people have the power to make individual decisions for themselves?\n \n etc... \n\n \n Poor analogy. National centralisation, regulation and wealth distribution has been rampant for over 50 years in Europe as well. What is happening now is that we are trying to create a minimum of uniformity between our nations. For some countries, this will mean more regulation and perhaps even wealth distribution. For others, it will mean reduced regulation and wealth distribution...\n \n \n \nSo as communism disappeared in Eastern Europe and Reagan's philosophy dominated American thinking, individualism has been on the rise. But a nation's belief in individualism is often overwhelmed by a warm and persuasive governmental benevolence that will in the end limit our opportunities. In Europe we see its growing power in Brussels; in America we see it in the current Social Security debate.\n\n \n Faulty analysis. Brussels is know for both dismantling the national wellfare systems as well as imposing new regulations. What we can wittness is the fall of the neo-liberal hegemony that had Europe in its tight grip from the end of the eightiees, up until the end of the ninetiees. We are now looking for alternative ways other than more of the same that proved to be ineffectual at best, highly damaging at worst.\n \n Not a bad read. Just a bit oppinionated and delusional :p",

You must keep tabs on inflation, which means that budget decifits must be maintained. You also want to avoid voilative situations that may encourage speculative attacks.\n \n \nand yes, it is more than an economic union now, which is why and how it will assume greater and greater power until member states are no longer sovereign. whether this is via the EU parliament or ad hoc committee hardly matter, unless you are interested in a political voice in your new supergovernment.\n\n \n Yup, that is the end stop. The question is really how and when we should get there.",

   "\n I too think it is invetable. But I think it will take some time. If France and Germany tries to rush things, it will sooner or later blow up in their face. All major changes in the Union must first be ratified by the member countries. The failiure to implement the Euro in countries like Denmark, Sweden and Brittain shows that EU can`t intensify too quickly. I have my doubts about the new consitution as well. To be honest, I think it has been pushed too hard.\n\n \n That's a normal method of negotiation, asking for everything to determine emotional (political) strengths and weaknesses for future bargaining purposes. Those who decline Euro affiliation are waiting to see how it plays in the world on a longer term basis to overcome national currency emotion. \n \n Make no mistake, the real potential strength of the Euro is in bonds based on economic unity with appropriate regulation, not currency exchange. Currency is merely a measuring device now somewhat easily manipulated on a current basis and rather boring as practical methodology when considering a unified Western Europe with China/Asia as a primary trading partner.",

Exchange costs are not really the issue, but rather the uncertainties regarding future exchange rates. By eliminating the uncertainties and risks involved with trading across monetary borders, trade will increase as well as lower transactions costs.",
