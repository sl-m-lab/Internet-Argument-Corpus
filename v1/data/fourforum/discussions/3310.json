   "Kerry and Edwards are taking a stroll around Capitol Hill when he meets\n \n a little girl carrying a small basket with a blanket over it.\n \n Curious, Kerry asks the girl; \"What's in the basket?\".\n \n She replies; \"New baby kittens\" and opens the basket to show him.\n \n \" How nice\" says Kerry. \" What kind are they?\".\n \n The little girl says, \"Democrats\".\n \n Kerry smiles and pats the little girl on the head and they continue on.\n \n About three weeks later, Kerry and another Congressional colleague are\n \n again strolling around Capitol Hill when he sees the little girl again\n \n with the same basket.\n \n Kerry says to his colleague; \"Watch this, it's very cute\" and they\n \n approach the little girl.\n \n Kerry asks the girl how the kittens are and she says fine.\n \n He then says, \"What kind of kittens are they?\" and she\n \n replies,\"Republicans.\"\n \n Somewhat abashed, Kerry says, \"Three weeks ago you said they were\n \n Democrats!\"\n \n \"I know,\" she says.\" But now their eyes are open\".\n \n **************************************************\n \n Debate question: Could this just have easily been pointed at the Republicans by switching \"Republicans\" and \"Democrats\" throughout? [...unlike the Hurricane Kerry joke which only worked because you can actually hide behind a bush.]\n \n If you choose to take the affirmative, please explain why a Democratic supporter didn't think of it first.\n \n ...",
