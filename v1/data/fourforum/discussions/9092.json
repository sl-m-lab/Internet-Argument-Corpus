   "The first concert I ever attended was KISS. I think it would've been '77 or '78, maybe '79. I know I wasn't older than 7.\n I remember bits and pieces of it. Mostly I remember asking my older brother, who was about 10, what that smell was...? He turned and asked my mom, who told us it was \"tobacco.\"\n Hmmm.... emoticon_xangel \n \n It was cool, tho. We saw them right after they'd come out with those 4 albums dedicated, each, to a single band member. For the next 3 years I was one of them for Halloween. Gene, then Ace, then Peter. Paul was lame. :)\n \n As for Ace being \"quite a guitar player\" I thought so at the time, but looking back (and being a player myself) he wasn't anything special in terms of his playing, but boy did I want a guitar that shot rockets!",

Check out Slipknot if you want to see freaks. Love those guys.\n http://www.slipknot-metal.com/gallery/members/group/images/group06.jpg",

   "Kiss is horrible. Who wants to look at some freak dressed up like Halloween with his tongue hanging out. Sick.\n\n \n Aren't you a buzz-kill! It was a show, magic, silliness, rock and roll. And frankly, millions around the world wanted to see it, and did. My kid is oh so bummed that a Kiss concert is not likely in his future. They put on a SHOW and played nuts and bolts rock and roll. If you close your eyes during \"Got Nothing to Lose\", you half expect to see kids in bobby socks dancing.\n \n Gene sticking out his tongue and waggling it is just ridiculous, it comes nowhere near the list of things in this world that are sick.\n \n Here is what a friend of mine posted about Kiss reflecting on when he saw them in 1978. His first concert. He is a severely talented, well-respected professional musician now - plays multiple instruments. He is a rocker. Successful. And has even been known to paint his face and put on platform boots from time to time. (Maybe you ought to try it, Jim.....)\n \n ____________________________________________\n \n KISS did it so right for a few years there. They were everything a kid could want and way more. Those years of my life are the most precious. The wonderment and thrill of something that was so COOL!,..so powerful, loud, melodic, fast, heavy, dark, black and silver, fiery, smoky, thrilling\n \n \n I had older friends and cousins me how talentless and silly KISS was. Those people completely alienated themselves from me with those words. You dont #### on a kid's parade like that! Of course KISS weren't the Beatles. (As much as Gene wishes they were) none of them were incredible musicians or song writers, but that wasn't the point. They were entertainers, rock & rollers, gods of thunder, comic books come to life! They were God, Superman and Aliens of another universe playing rock & roll! They were everything to me for those few years. I didn't know how the music business worked; how the entertainment business worked. I couldnt see the man behind the curtain. I thank my lucky stars my imagination is healthy enough for me to sometimes forget that there is a man behind a curtain and still enjoy rock & roll. Still lose myself in the fantasy. Yes, thank my lucky stars especially the black one painted on his right eye.",
