   "Some of those question are really tough because they make you pick one extreme over another.\n \n \"If economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.\"\n \n Primarily humanity, but wouldn't that result from the interest of corporations?\n \n \"Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.\"\n \n One is not necessarily more important than the other.\n \n \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his need is a fundamentally good idea.\"\n \n In theory, yes. In practice, no.\n \n \"Land shouldn't be a commodity to be bought and sold.\"\n \n It must be decided what land is better suited for private ownership and what land isn't.\n \n \"Those with the ability to pay should have the right to higher standards of medical care .\"\n \n Is medical care a right?\n \n \"Schools should not make classroom attendance compulsory.\"\n \n Which schools? Public schools? Should there be public schools? (I think Brits have the public and private reversed.)\n \n \"It's natural for children to keep some secrets from their parents.\"\n Is it my opinion if it's natural or not?\n \n When you are troubled, it's better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things. \n I guess it depends on what's troubling you.\n \n Abstract art that doesn't represent anything shouldn't be considered art at all. \n What does this have to do with politics?\n \n In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation. \n Depends on the offense.\n \n Multinational companies are unethically exploiting the plant genetic resources of developing countries. \n ???\n \n Religion and morality are closely linked. \n There's no follow up asking if religion is necessary for morality. Obviously the two are linked.\n \n Charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged. \n In theory or in practise?\n \n But here's me:\n Economic Left/Right: -4.88\n Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: -3.85\n \n It looks like I'm right on top of Nelson Mandela.\n \n -----------------------------------------------------------\n Next test:\n \n \"Anybody who wants top-quality health care should expect to have to pay for it\" \n You're going to have to pay for it one way or another. They must mean at the door.\n \n Our nation has a glorious history. \n Had to put no opinion here. At least they give you that choice. Some of it was glorious, some not so much.\n \n Smokers should be able to receive medical care for smoking-related illnesses even if they still smoke. \n Had to put no opinion because they didn't ask who pays for it.\n \n Correct grammar doesn't matter. \n Under what cicumstances?\n \n Results:\n Axis Position\n 1 left/right -2.7071 (-0.1629)\n 2 pragmatism +5.0040 (+0.3012)\n \n It makes it sound like I'm a lefty :) when I'm more of a libby.",
