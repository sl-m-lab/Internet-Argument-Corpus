   "My post on \"unhinged\" political behavior on the right and the left (on Dave Neiwert's critique of Michelle Malkin's book Unhinged) has generated a rather heated discussion in the comments, as well as a thoughtful response here.\n \n The main thrust of a lot of the responses from the left is that is that I am drawing a false moral equivalency between extremist rhetoric on the left and the right when the right is demonstrably worse. (Some posters from the right make the same criticism in reverse.)\n \n Most of the criticism focuses on what Neiwert calls \"eliminationist rhetoric\" -- talk of getting rid of political opponents \"either through violence or through mass roundups and incarceration.\" Ann Coulter provides some grist (\"My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times Building\"; \"We need to execute people like John Walker in order to physically intimidate liberals, by making them realize that they can be killed too\"). There's also a 1995 quote from Rush Limbaugh (\"I tell people don't kill all the liberals. Leave enough so we can have two on every campus -- living fossils -- so we will never forget what these people stood for\"), and another one from 2005 where Rush muses aloud that if it's a good idea for us to learn from the laws of other nations, we ought to borrow the new British law allowing the deportation of hate-preaching extremists: \"Wouldn't it be great if anybody who speaks out against this country, to kick them out of the country? Anybody that threatens this country, kick 'em out. We'd get rid of Michael Moore, we'd get rid of half the Democratic Party if we would just import that law. That would be fabulous.\" There is also Bill O'Reilly's suggestion that the staff of Air America be locked up for \"undermining\" the country, and his comment about not protecting San Francisco from terrorist attacks in retaliation from the city barring military recruiters from schools.\n \n All this is, of course, vile stuff, and there is no excuse for it (including \"humor\"). And I'll concede that it has no precise equivalent on the left (Ward Churchill is too negligible to count -- his only fame comes from the right). I'll show interpretive charity to Michael Moore and assume that when he lamented that if the 9/11 terrorists wanted to get back at Bush, they struck at cities where most people didn't vote for him, he meant only that the attack made no sense from that angle, not that it would have been better if they had struck in, say, Dallas. And I'll stipulate that when Garrison Keillor -- who has an audience of nearly 4 million on National Public Radio -- joked about taking the vote away from born-again Christians, it wasn't quite so bad as joking about killing them off.\n \n But is it that qualitatively different? Dave Neiwert, after all, cites as one of his examples of Ann Coulter's out-of-bounds rhetoric her suggestion that women shouldn't vote (because they tend to vote the \"wrong\" way).\n \n No one really thinks (I hope) that Limbaugh, Coulter, and O'Reilly are seriously advocating the murder and incarceration of millions of liberals. What makes their rhetoric so poisonous is that (a) as Neiwert points out, it amounts to \"a declaration of enmity\" rather than a desire to debate, and (b) certain ideas, such as killing or rounding up one's political opponents, are too vile to be broached even as a \"joke.\"\n \n Viewed that way, there isn't that much distance between urging deportation and urging secession. Laudably, Neiwert points to the \"XXXX the South\" post-election screed, which calls for the expulsion of the Southern states from the Union and ends with \"XXXX off,\" as a lamentable example of hateful speech on the left: \"[I]n the end, it's an argument for writing off your fellow Americans.\" But there are other, more mainstream examples of this mindset; two prominent Democratic pundits, Lawrence O'Donnell and Bob Beckel, made post-election comments about Southern secession.\n \n The issue is hate as a dominant mode of relating to people on the other side of the political divide. It can be expressed in \"liberal hunting license\" bumper stickers as documented by Neiwert. Or it can be expressed in this Democratic Underground thread, where a poster writes that she didn't stop to help a stranded motorist with a small child in sweltering heat after she saw a \"W\" bumper sticker on the woman's car, and most of the other posters not only reassure her that she shouldn't feel bad but congratulate her. (One poster writes, \"[E]verytime I see one of those stickers, the hate that fills my mind is almost embarrassing. People I don't even know, and I see that sticker and all of a sudden I hate their guts.\")\n \n ....\n Today, this mindset has become rampant on the left and the right, and not just on the fringes but in the mainstream as well.\n \n In my earlier thread, one poster asked if I would suggest any remedies for this problem. I wish I could. The only solution I can think of is to rebuke political hate speech and to ostracize its perpetrators -- starting with those in one's own camp. It should be up to politicians to take the initiative. Imagine if the next Republican or Democratic presidential contender gave a \"Sister Souljah\" speech denouncing the political hatemongers in his or her party. Is this really an impossible dream? \n\n The Y Files: Extremism, hate speech, and moral equivalency\n \n A very good article, IMO.\n Bill Maher grates on my nerves with his rants at times. He often has good points, but then again he often opens his yap and is downright insulting.\n Michael Moore is one that the author mentioned that also bugs me. His \"Bowling for Columbine\" movie included a cartoon that was incredibly denigrating towards whites.\n \n Unfortunately, on the right we see such things like this thread:\n http://www.4forums.com/political/politics-debates/13367-republican-national-committee-sponsors-newsmax.html#post372375\n Examples of the right wing POLITICAL LEADERS ACTIVELY EMBRACING such insanity... emoticon_frazzled\n \n And the right evidently can't be bothered with it...",

   "I guess the point I was trying to make (albeit feebly) is that these false dichotomies appear, to me, like a \"good cop, bad cop\" scenario. & if I'm not mistaken, foundit66 & others here were saying much the same thing. Our government is, in theory, supposed to be a representative republic or some such but it sure doesn't seem that way sometimes. Both sides are representing or being influenced by the same groups (which I see as being mostly in the interest of blocs of industry) rather than representing the individuals who, in theory, vote them into office, thus the \"good cop, bad cop\" scenario. Then, & this is probably the most frustrating part, those whose intent is to \"divide & conquer\" are able to pass legislation or introduce mediocre reforms which do not succeed in benefitting the individuals they signed on to serve. Like a \"bait & switch\" con game. For example, the healthcare reform initiatives. Who can deny this country needs healthcare reform? The way it works now, the USA system is one of the most costly yet doesn't cover all its people. Compared to other countries on various measures or scales, it's not as effective. Healthcare reform was tried in the past & failed yet the costs continue to rise by leaps & bounds. Now here we are again & what's going to happen this time? Who will benefit from no significant reforms? Not the people, that's for sure. Seems to me, the health insurance industry will be the only ones to benefit from no or mediocre reforms. Oh & by the way, they are the ones driving the process & influencing both sides of Congress! While the people are divided by throwing out buzzwords of Socialism! & other mind numbing con games. \n \n & imo, the economic manipulations work in much the same way. Not done for the people or by the people. Sometimes it seems like some sort of puppet regime. I think more  people have to become more  involved in the processes.\n \n Do you think the (status quo) system is working? If you think the system isn't working, what needs to change? How can we, as a people, direct those processes?\n \n If you think the (status quo) system is working, then it would follow that nothing needs to change, right?\n \n If you believe in change, you're in luck! Change is probably one of the very few things in life that's inevitable. Everything changes. That's life.\n \n How can we, as a people, direct those changes? Of course the direction we take will never be without problems because we, as a people, are not infallible nor are we omnipotent. It probably won't be useful to \"believe\" in any one system as a \"saviour\" or religion. That's a tough road to take because somewhere, on that road, you will most likely notice the problems inherent in any faith-based system. & how do you solve the contradicitons? An example. If you are a \"fervent believer\" in \"status quo capitalism,\" how do you solve the \"unacceptable\" entitlements given to individual people with the \"acceptable\" entitlements given to corporations (through corporate welfare, bailouts & the like)? Both of these things come from the same system whatever \"name\" you wanna give it & we are ALL responsible. We are ALL responsible for the bailouts & for the individual entitlements, you can't have it both ways. They both come from the same system (whatever you wanna call it). If you measure these things in dollars & cents, it probably costs more for the corporate entitlements.\n \n However you look at these things & whatever conclusions you may come to, you still have to ask yourself, \"Is it working?\" How do you measure whether or not you're reaching your objectives or goals? Well, first of all, you have to HAVE a goal, \"What do we, as a people, want?\" One of the first steps might be to decide what we want & to take responsibility for the way the world is right now. Look around & see where we are. Accept the good, the bad & the ugly. All of it. It is what it is.\n \n What do we want?\n \n The way things remain presently - we have every reason to think we will be right back where we currently are, same place but in an indeterminate amount of time. Is this acceptable?",

   "The general co-chairman of John McCain's presidential campaign, former Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), led the charge in 1999 to repeal a Depression-era banking regulation law that Democrat Barack Obama claimed on Thursday contributed significantly to today's economic turmoil.\n \n \"A regulatory structure set up for banks in the 1930s needed to change because the nature of business had changed,\" the Illinois senator running for president said in a New York economic speech. \"But by the time [it] was repealed in 1999, the $300 million lobbying effort that drove deregulation was more about facilitating mergers than creating an efficient regulatory framework.\"\n \n Gramm's role in the swift and dramatic recent restructuring of the nation's investment houses and practices didn't stop there.\n \n A year after the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act repealed the old regulations, Swiss Bank UBS gobbled up brokerage house Paine Weber. Two years later, Gramm settled in as a vice chairman of UBS's new investment banking arm.\n \n Later, he became a major player in its government affairs operation. According to federal lobbying disclosure records, Gramm lobbied Congress, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department about banking and mortgage issues in 2005 and 2006.\n\n McCain guru linked to subprime crisis - Lisa Lerer - Politico.com\n \n Not to mention Gramm and his greedy little wife Wendy presiding over the Enron debacle:\n \nWhen Senator Phil Gramm and his wife Wendy danced, it was most often to Enron's tune.\n \n Mr. Gramm, a Texas Republican, is one of the top recipients of Enron largess in the Senate. And he is a demon for deregulation. In December 2000 Mr. Gramm was one of the ringleaders who engineered the stealthlike approval of a bill that exempted energy commodity trading from government regulation and public disclosure. It was a gift tied with a bright ribbon for Enron.\n \n Wendy Gramm has been influential in her own right. She, too, is a demon for deregulation. She headed the presidential Task Force on Regulatory Relief in the Reagan administration. And she was chairwoman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission from 1988 until 1993.\n \n In her final days with the commission she helped push through a ruling that exempted many energy futures contracts from regulation, a move that had been sought by Enron. Five weeks later, after resigning from the commission, Wendy Gramm was appointed to Enron's board of directors.\n \n According to a report by Public Citizen, a watchdog group in Washington, ''Enron paid her between $915,000 and $1.85 million in salary, attendance fees, stock options and dividends from 1993 to 2001.''\n \n As a board member, Ms. Gramm has served on Enron's audit committee, but her eyesight wasn't any better than that of the folks at Arthur Andersen. The one thing Enron did not pay big bucks for was vigilance. \n\n Enron And the Gramms - The New York Times\n \n Utterly amazing how those two thieves single-handedly destroyed our country.",

   "I consider myself a Jeffersonian Liberal. I think the potential dichotomy of government control vs hands off WRT the banking industry can be settled very easily. If you're customers are covered by FDIC, you live with government regulations as a condition of that insurance.\n \n It's dangerous for a cartel to set US fiscal policy. The Creature from Jekyll Island is a banking monopoly that is enforced by the Federal Government. Uncle Sam guarantees their profits AND, more importantly, covers their bad investments through taxpayer bailouts.\n \n Very well put. The party \"in charge\" may change in name, but the real power resides in the financial institutions of the world. Anyone that doesn't believe it should pay attention to the recent bailouts of the banks. Congress was so busy in making sure the PRIVATE banks didn't lose any money that they gave them $700Billion with no strings attached. It was only after public outcry over continuing opulent displays that Congress felt any need to control their free money.\n\n \n Sorry for goin back to this, I just went back & watched that Creature from Jekyll Island thingie but I still have lots of questions (& how unusual is THAT?). The Federal Reserve derives its powers from Congress which is supposed to represent the people & granted it's not working out that way. However when people speak about \"ending the Fed\" I'm still not sure what they expect to replace it with? In God We Trust? I just don't get it? I DO believe the separation of Religion & State was a good idea. I think we've slowly but surely gotten away from THAT solid originating concept & imo, to our own detriment. Oddly enough I came across & agree with the words of Jim Wallis, an evangelical xian guy who wrote God's Politics: Why the Right Gets It Wrong & the Left Doesn't Get It when he wrote: \n \nMany of us feel that our faith has been stolen, & it's time to take it back ... How did the faith of Jesus come to be known as pro-rich, pro-war, & only pro-American? What has happened here? \n\n Odd because I thought to myself, here I am an agnostical, discordian, jesus-loving, taoist, etc. & I find myself agreeing with an evangelical xian guy? Hhhmmm. & then there are those holy economic theorist guys with their students or followers described as \"faithful disciples\"? Honestly, what HAS happened here?\n \n I do agree it's irresponsible & dangerous for a cartel or monopoly to have such great influence when it comes to US policy. What I don't understand is how to make changes to the status quo without starting over from scratch? How do you make the economic system of capitalism work alongside removing the Federal Reserve? & the blending of economic theory with faith-based belief systems doesn't seem to help. People continue to be polarized or divided along lines that seem to brook no compromise. Sometimes I think it's like cutting off your nose to spite your face.\n \n I like to think of these things using the concepts of systems thinking: \n \n \nSystems thinking is any process of estimating or inferring how local policies, actions, or changes influence the state of the neighboring universe. It also can be defined, as an approach to problem solving, as viewing \"problems\" as parts of an overall system, rather than reacting to present outcomes or events and potentially contributing to further development of the undesired issue or problem.[1] Systems thinking is a framework that is based on the belief that the component parts of a system can best be understood in the context of relationships with each other and with other systems, rather than in isolation. The only way to fully understand why a problem or element occurs and persists is to understand the part in relation to the whole.\n -Wikipedia\n",

You want to classify them as hateful. For the sake of argument I'll assume this to be true but in doing so I'd claim that newspapers are also hateful and so are blogs like that \"democratic underground\" site. A 2008 pew study show people get their news from the TV, internet, and then last is newspaper. If you want to go by reach...which is what you seem to do since you said radio...than the left-wing 'hate\" TV wins on late night (not cable). Right wing \"hate\" news on cable news. Left-wing \"hate\" wins on the newspaper and internet. The left-wing \"hate\" guy Jon Stewart is the most trusted name in news according to your posting a few months back.\n \n Show some real evidence..not your \"well look at radio\" XXXX. \n \n \nYou accuse me of not doing my research, and you can't even keep track of things I've shown just a few posts back?\nIt's hard to keep track of nothing. \n \n \nBut NOT ONCE have you shown any cogent evidence that they are equal... emoticon_xdonno\nThe burden of proof is on you since you made the claim to begin with.",

   "Pray tell me exactly what it was that the GLB Act did and where, pray tell, are your FactCheck citations?\n\n \n This answers both your questions: FactCheck.org: Who Caused the Economic Crisis?\n The bill in question is the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which was passed in 1999 and repealed portions of the Glass-Steagall Act, a piece of legislation from the era of the Great Depression that imposed a number of regulations on financial institutions. It's true that Gramm authored the act, but what became law was a widely accepted bipartisan compromise. The measure passed the House 362 - 57, with 155 Democrats voting for the bill. The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 90 - 8. Among the Democrats voting for the bill: Obama's running mate, Joe Biden. The bill was signed into law by President Clinton, a Democrat. If this bill really had \"stripped the safeguards that would have protected us,\" then both parties share the blame, not just \"John McCain's friend.\"\n \n The truth is, however, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act had little if anything to do with the current crisis. In fact, economists on both sides of the political spectrum have suggested that the act has probably made the crisis less severe than it might otherwise have been.\n \n Last year the liberal writer Robert Kuttner, in a piece in The American Prospect, argued that \"this old-fashioned panic is a child of deregulation.\" But even he didn't lay the blame primarily on Gramm-Leach-Bliley. Instead, he described \"serial bouts of financial deregulation\" going back to the 1970s. And he laid blame on policies of the Federal Reserve Board under Alan Greenspan, saying \"the Fed has become the chief enabler of a dangerously speculative economy.\"\n \n What Gramm-Leach-Bliley did was to allow commercial banks to get into investment banking. Commercial banks are the type that accept deposits and make loans such as mortgages; investment banks accept money for investment into stocks and commodities. In 1998, regulators had allowed Citicorp, a commercial bank, to acquire Traveler's Group, an insurance company that was partly involved in investment banking, to form Citigroup. That was seen as a signal that Glass-Steagall was a dead letter as a practical matter, and Gramm-Leach-Bliley made its repeal formal. But it had little to do with mortgages.\n",

   "A selective memory? 8 months in Bush had 9/11 so you really can only look before that.\n\n Thanks for pointing out the obvious...\n Should I have been more precise and said 8 months minus a week so you couldn't pick at nits?\n emoticon_ic\n \n \n \nIn June 2001 Bush has about a 50-52% approval rating which is not much lower than what he started with. Why? Because democrats felt he stole the election and were angry about that. 8 and a half years later the dems are STILL mad about that. Either you weren't old enough to remember or you have forgotten an enormous amount since 2001. \n\n And there you go moving the goal-posts.\n This discussion is NOT about simple \"disapproval\".\n It is about EXTREMISM and HATRED that is involved in such things like \"Obama is a Kenyan\" or \"Obama is a secret Muslim\".\n \n The people that \"disapproved\" of Bush did NOT by and large hate him, spreading vicious rumors like the modern day Republicans are.\n \n Try to keep track of the conversation.\n \n \n \nI posts the links...nothing made up there.\n\n You are seriously cowering from the main issue.\n I'll keep saying it, and you'll continue to cower from addressing it...\n \n 1) You have posted evidence of the EXISTENCE of left-wing hatred.\n I agree to that.\n \n 2) You have NOT posted evidence proving your claim of EQUAL left-wing hatred.\n NOT ONCE have you even tried to provide any semblance of truth that it is equal.\n And considering how many times I have repeated that, you are either being purposefully obfuscational or blindly obtuse.\n \n \n \nYou were wrong about Palin..what can I say? That isn't the only instance.\n\n Again, you had an opinion that I was wrong.\n Once again, you are pretending that your opinion disagreeing with mine somehow makes me unreliable.\n No.\n That just makes you arrogant.\n \n \n \nWe can look back at the politics debate/news forum and see a number of posting articles that were poorly researched opinion pieces.\n\n You're welcome to try.\n I already told you once that we could revisit the Palin thread if you wanted to.\n I don't recall you starting that thread up again, so I assumed you were avoiding that as well...\n \n \n \nYou are doing a poor job of it. Lets recap:\n\n And what follows is Steeeeve's Blatant Lie or Willful Ignorance...\n \n \n \nFoundit66: \"The reason you hear more about Republicans is because they are the ones who do it more.\"\n Steeeeve: \"No it isn't.\"\n\n That's a pathetic attempt at a summary.\n You are pretending to summarize a discussion on WHY one hears more hatred from the Republicans, and that is actually new territory that I don't think either of us have covered.\n We have been talking about a disagreement on whether or not Republicans DO have more hatred...\n \n And furthermore, I have DOCUMENTED that Republicans have more right-wing hatred than the left-wing has left-wing hatred.\n Republican right-wing hatred SELLS in the form of DOCUMENTABLE book sales with Limbaugh, Beck, and Coulter.\n Right-wing hate media SELLS and HAS AN AUDIENCE with Beck and Limbaugh on the media.\n \n It's not even a comparison.\n And NOT ONCE have you tried to dispute that.\n You just repeatedly ignore it...\n \n You cannot be trusted to summarize other people's positions.\n \n \n \nI've shown numerous examples where this isn't true, even in recent history. You've shown nothing. All you do is say the same old thing as if you are stalling or don't have a response.\n\n Again, either you are purposefully deceitful or just plain dense.\n You have shown examples where left-wing hatred EXISTS WHICH I DO NOT REFUTE.\n You have shown no documentation to back up YOUR CLAIM that left-wing hatred is equal to right-wing hatred.\n \n \n \nLeft-wing hate newspapers has a market\n Left-wing hate websites and blogs have a market\n Left wing hate night time news has a market\n\n Again, I invite the viewing audience to look at the words.\n He is talking about the EXISTENCE of left-wing hate, WHICH I AGREE WITH HIM ON. Left-wing hate DOES EXIST.\n \n But my point is that the right-wing, by and large, has a MUCH LARGER audience than the left-wing media.\n \n \n \nI thought I'd share those since you seem to think everything is hate. \n\n Again, you refuse to accurately portray my position.\n No. Not \"everything\" is hate.\n I have been explicit in giving SPECIFIC examples.\n LIMBAUGH. BECK. COULTER.\n Not once have you tried to refute those examples.\n \n There are plenty of right-wing resources which I have NOT listed, so it is absurd for you to claim that I think \"everything is hate\".\n I challenge you to quote me as to what I said that would lead you to claim I \"think everything is hate\", but again we both know you'll cowardly duck that challenge...\n \n \n \nHere is one example of \"books\" in the 2004 election:\n Political Patterns on the WWW -- Divided We Stand\n Fairly equal\n Political Patterns on the WWW\n 2003 map of the same thing\n\n Again, you argue left-wing hatred EXISTS, which I agree to.\n I argue that it is NOT EQUAL.\n \n \n \nBooks always go against the people currently in power.\n\n Let's see.\n Six years of Republican congress with Republican president.\n Do you need a list of Democrat bashing books that came out during that time?\n They were still VERY prominent.\n \n \n \nYou then bring up radio which is Rush, Hannity, Beck for the big 3. You want to classify them as hateful. For the sake of argument I'll assume this to be true but in doing so I'd claim that newspapers are also hateful and so are blogs like that \"democratic underground\" site.\n\n And the same could be said of right-wing resources.\n There is a thread on here that talks about how WND talked openly of a coup recently.\n And I could easily name a few Republican sites that are the mirror image of \"democratic underground\".\n \n But again, you are showing EXISTENCE and NOT EQUIVALENCE.\n NOTHING to compare between the two.\n \n \n \nA 2008 pew study show people get their news from the TV, internet, and then last is newspaper. If you want to go by reach...which is what you seem to do since you said radio...than the left-wing 'hate\" TV wins on late night (not cable).\n\n That's an awfully big brush you are using to describe these groups with.\n And I think we both know why you can't go into specifics... Beyond cowardice.\n We both know that if you try to give examples of the left-wing media, like Olbermann, I'll easily turn around and SHOW THE RATINGS to show how the right-wing's \"hate\" reach is so much greater than the left-wing's \"hate\" reach.\n \n But here you are again trying to move the goal-posts by just talking about the EXISTENCE of left-wing media.\n In this paragraph, you are not even delineating between hate and non-hate media.\n \n \n \nThe left-wing \"hate\" guy Jon Stewart is the most trusted name in news according to your posting a few months back.\n\n I would love to see you try to document your claim that Jon Stewart is \"hate\".\n \n \n \nShow some real evidence..not your \"well look at radio\" XXXX. \n\n I wasn't just talking about radio, but also book sales and TV.\n But why bother you to be accurate (or should I say truthful) on that...",

   "Is that just your opinion or can you actually prove that claim?\n\n Look at the issues.\n I've already documented the \"Obama is the anti-christ\" poll.\n Other issues.A whopping 58 percent of Republicans either think Barack Obama wasn't born in the US (28 percent) or aren't sure (30 percent). A mere 42 percent think he was.58 percent of GOP not sure/doubt Obama born in US - Glenn Thrush - POLITICO.com\n \n And then there is the \"Obama =< Muslim\" issue. Ironically, I think that issue lost some traction with the Rev Wright issue, but I have heard some Republicans utter a claim regarding Muslim while in the next breath talk about his Rev issues... emoticon_xdonno\n Some Republicans don't recognize the contradiction.\n \n Do you really want to compare what Bush had to all that?\n Cause I got more regarding statements on Obama = Nazi / Socialist / Communist / etc, etc, etc...\n \n \n \nWell of course their eyes rolled. It was Chavez who was saying it.\n\n Wow dude.\n Talk about completely ignoring my point.\n \n I can provide documenting POLLS showing a significant presence of Republicans thinking Obama is (or may be) the anti-christ.\n Can you provide anything equivalent for Bush?\n \n Of course you can't.\n \n \n \nBTW, just so you know, the concept of the 'anti-christ' and the devil are not the same thing. Apples and oranges.\n\n No. Not \"apples and oranges\".\n Both are examples of religious associations presuming a party leader to be a much reviled religious figure.\n \n But, if you want to go \"apples and apples\", I gave a poll showing how many people think Obama is the anti-Christ.\n Can you show a poll showing how many people thought Bush was the anti-Christ?\n \n Nah. You don't have any real topical comment, do you...\n \n \n \nDoesn't prove anything. I'd love to see you say what IS that \"significant percentage\", btw. You probably won't.\n\n Are you freakin' serious?\n My gawd man. Are you that thick?\n THESE POLLS EXIST!\n Why would I not present it?\n \n I have already done so above!\n \n \n \nNo, you just start thread after thread and spend almost ALL of your efforts on that topic in posting on right-wing smears and only acknowledging the left-wing ones mostly when challenged on it.\n\n Another Blatant Lie or Willful Ignorance on your part.\n I was the one who started the thread talking about each party's extremist hate.\n I even gave a couple great examples in my opening post, unprompted.\n \n Your allegation is false, but of course you'll never be truthful enough to admit it...\n \n \n \nUm... no, you completely failed to prove your point ...\n\n ROFLMAO!\n SEE???\n This is EXACTLY what I'm talking about.\n I point to JYOSHU's CLAIM, and how does he respond?\n NOT by providing any proof, when challenged.\n NOT by trying to FURTHER his claim.... :xbanghead\n \n No. He instead tries to shift the focus to me instead, giving ABSOLUTELY NO refutation for my assessment.\n \n \n \nyou completely failed to prove your point that one is more than the other to BEGIN with. You lost the issue the instant you failed to prove your silly assertion.\n\n I've repeatedly talked about the proof.\n It's in the ratings.\n Compare Olberman's ratings to O'Reilly's. Olberman sucks in comparison.\n The right-wing DOMINATES the hate issue.\n \n Your attempted response was to try to drag in the \"blogosphere\", ignoring both the fact that there is a RIGHT-WING blogosphere (very present on this board) and also ignoring any attempt to QUANTIFY your claims.\n \n And furthermore, I keep providing the proof in its various forms (like polls of Repubs believing slurs about Obama) and you keep ignoring them. emoticon_xdonno",

   "And there you go moving the goal-posts.\n This discussion is NOT about simple \"disapproval\".\n It is about EXTREMISM and HATRED that is involved in such things like \"Obama is a Kenyan\" or \"Obama is a secret Muslim\".\nYou mean like calling bush the devil, evil, terrorist, etc etc. In any event, disapproval is the first place you find hate. Try to keep up.\n \n \n2) You have NOT posted evidence proving your claim of EQUAL left-wing hatred.\nI'm not the one who made the claim. YOU DID. I've shown similar instances of hate which may not prove the opposite of your claim but certainly puts a lot of dents in yours. \n \n So lets hear it...\n \n \nAnd what follows is Steeeeve's Blatant Lie or Willful Ignorance...\n That's a pathetic attempt at a summary.\n....keep in mind those are direct quotes. Too funny.\n \n \nAnd furthermore, I have DOCUMENTED that Republicans have more right-wing hatred than the left-wing has left-wing hatred.\nYou have documented nothing actually. Maybe your definition of documentation is to just write your own opinion on these forums and if that is the case don't tell your writing teacher because you'd fail the class. You have one link which is actually just a repost of something I linked to. It shows nothing to your claim and if anything supports mine. Might I add that I gave you links to political books over time. Just read the titles and tell me if those are different from the Limbaugh, Beck, and Coulter books. I've doubt you've even read a Beck or Limbaugh book so I'm wondering how you know it is hate speech anyway. I'd suspect some are but I haven't read them all myself. \n \n \nRepublican right-wing hatred SELLS in the form of DOCUMENTABLE book sales with Limbaugh, Beck, and Coulter.\n\"Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat XXXXX and Other Observations\" got to number 4 on the best sellers list as one example of you how are wrong. \n \n \nRight-wing hate media SELLS and HAS AN AUDIENCE with Beck and Limbaugh on the media.\nRight-wing media sells...no doubt about that (See Fox News ratings). We are talking about a hate though and to date you have shown nothing to prove the right has more \"hate\" than the left. \n \n \nYou cannot be trusted to summarize other people's positions.\nAnd you can't be trusted to defend your own! Perhaps you should worry about that first. \n \n \nBut my point is that the right-wing, by and large, has a MUCH LARGER audience than the left-wing media.\nFor the millionth time, PROVE IT. You made the claim to begin with, I called you on it...now prove it. You've shown absolutely nothing to show this. Perhaps it is just your opinion you don't think you can prove it. So if that's the case just say so. \n \n \nI have been explicit in giving SPECIFIC examples.\n LIMBAUGH. BECK. COULTER.\n Not once have you tried to refute those examples.\nI don't need to refute them. I can actually just assume they are hateful and it still doesn't support your argument. \n \n \nThere are plenty of right-wing resources which I have NOT listed, so it is absurd for you to claim that I think \"everything is hate\".\nYou just gave \"specifics\" by generally giving me three people's names. You imply everything they do is hate. \n \n \nLet's see.\n Six years of Republican congress with Republican president.\n Do you need a list of Democrat bashing books that came out during that time?\n They were still VERY prominent.\nYeah, I showed that in my links. Republican bashing books exist right now. Of course they don't sell well with a democratic party as congress and president. \n \n \nAnd I could easily name a few Republican sites that are the mirror image of \"democratic underground\".\nNo doubt about it. \n \n \nBut again, you are showing EXISTENCE and NOT EQUIVALENCE.\n NOTHING to compare between the two.\nAnd you haven't shown anything. \n \n \nWe both know that if you try to give examples of the left-wing media, like Olbermann, I'll easily turn around and SHOW THE RATINGS to show how the right-wing's \"hate\" reach is so much greater than the left-wing's \"hate\" reach.\nThen I could show the nightly news ratings for NBC, CBS, and ABC and win...but more importantly I don't think any of these are hateful even if they are biased. \n \n \nIn this paragraph, you are not even delineating between hate and non-hate media.\nAhhh exactly. And you do the same. Not every republican book is hateful, I think we can agree on that. Not every radio show is hateful, I hope we can agree on that. I think your problem is you think everything that has dubious facts is hate (which is odd because you'd be a very hateful person if this were your standard). \n \n In any event, you haven't shown anything dealing with your claim. \n \n \nI would love to see you try to document your claim that Jon Stewart is \"hate\".\nUnder my definition of hate Jon Stewart is fine...just short on facts. This is why hate was in quotes. By your implied definition everything he does is hate.",
