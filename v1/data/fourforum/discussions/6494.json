Rapes, violence and estimates of the dead were wrong.\n http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-rumors27sep27,0,5492806,full.story?coll=la-home-headlines\n \n This doesn't surprise me--this along with a lot of people anxious to find something to blame on Bush has caused him some political fallout. We need to be cautious about the media and know that things are sometimes not always as they seem on the news.",
