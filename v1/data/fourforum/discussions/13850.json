   "The Wise will understand this Parable:\n \n Parable of the Wedding Feast - Matthew 22:1-14\n \n 2\"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. 3He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come. 4\"Then he sent some more servants and said, `Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.' 5\"But they paid no attention and went off--one to his field, another to his business. 6The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them. 7The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. \n 8\"Then he said to his servants, `The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come. 9Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.' 10So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. 11\"But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. 12`Friend,' he asked, `how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' The man was speechless. 13\"Then the king told the attendants, `Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' 14\"For many are invited, but few are chosen.\" \n \n In this Parable:\n 1. The King = God the Father \n 2. The Son = God the Son, Jesus Christ\n 3. The first group that was invited = The Israelites who declined\n 4. The second group that was invited = The Gentiles and those Jews who accepted\n 5. The servants = those who preach the Gospel of Christ&#8217;s salvation\n \n Explanation of the Parable:\n \n God's chosen people, the Jews, were the first to receive the invitation to receive their Savior Jesus Christ, the Son of God whom they rejected. The Wedding / Gospel invitation was then given to others (the gentiles - note Romans 1:16, etc.). In short, everyone had received an invitation, but not everyone accepted the invitation.\n \n Note that the Book of Revelation describes a future marriage of the Lamb (Jesus - John 1:29) and His Bride (Revelation 19:7).\n \n The guest who was not arrayed in the proper wedding attire was one who had declined God&#8217;s gift of salvation and righteousness - a robe of righteousness that comes not from man, but from Christ/God only:\n \n Isaiah 61:10, &#8220;I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.&#8221;\n \n Note that in Genesis 15:6, this righteousness comes through faith in God: &#8220;Abram believed (had faith in) the Lord, and it was credited to him as righteousness.&#8221; Also note Ephesians 2:8-9 in the New Testament.\n \n Believers are covered with God&#8217;s garment of righteousness / salvation. When God looks at the repentant sinner He does not see the filthy attire of sin, but the robe of righteousness obtained by Christ's perfect obedience to the law. There are none righteous apart from this God-given righteousness. A perfect example that this righteousness is not obtained by man&#8217;s own inherent &#8220;goodness&#8221; is found in Zechariah chapter 3:\n \n 3 Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel. 4 The angel said to those who were standing before him, \"Take off his filthy clothes.\" Then he said to Joshua, \"See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put rich garments on you.\"\n \n Filthy clothes = sin in the above scripture, while a robe of righteousness = a garment of salvation in Isaiah 61:10.\n \n From the New Testament we find:\n \n Romans 13:14 - &#8220;Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ...&#8221; \n Philippians 3:9 - &#8220;..not having a righteousness of my own that comes from (keeping ) the law, but that which is through faith in Christ...&#8221;\n \n Also note that in Matthew 22:10 - &#8220;...the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.&#8221;\n \n Here we see the illustration of those gathered off the streets - people who may well have not been able to afford special wedding garments on such short notice. Also note that those gathered were both &#8220;good and bad,&#8221; so that the invitation was not based on works alone, otherwise just the &#8220;good&#8221; would have been invited. So the wedding garments - the garments of salvation - were God&#8217;s gift to those who accepted the invitation to the Son&#8217;s (Christ&#8217;s) wedding to his bride - his church of true believers.\n \n In the end, those without the God / Christ-given robe of righteousness / salvation were cast into the outer darkness, where there is weeping and the gnashing of teeth.\n \n &#8220;For many are invited, but few are chosen.&#8221; Matthew 22:14\n \n How to be Saved in Jesus (Includes a prayer of salvation):\n \n Getting Saved By Jesus\n \n Beware of what lies ahead if you keep rejecting Jesus Christ.\n \n You are not guaranteed tomorrow.

   "\n 2Pe 3:9 The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.\n The atheists and secular humanists must realize that God has clearly defined for us that although He is long suffering, His patience will not last forever. History is culminating in a finality which is leading to an inevitable judgement, and we were blessed as a generation to live toward the end of this journey of Gods plan for human redemption. These unbelievers must be warned that the time is short and Gods patience is running out and His wrath is about to be poured out upon all of mankind for our universal rebellion against His holiness as our one and only God and Creator.\n \n Jhn 3:16 \"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.\n \n Jhn 10:28 and I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand. \n Both the believer and the unbeliever have very real promises we can embrace. For the believer, it is that God will never leave or forsake us. For the unbeliever, it is that God will most assuredly pour out His wrath upon an unbelieving world.\n \n Act 13:40 \"Therefore take heed, so that the thing spoken of in the Prophets may not come upon {you:}\n Act 13:41 'BEHOLD, YOU SCOFFERS, AND MARVEL, AND PERISH; FOR I AM ACCOMPLISHING A WORK IN YOUR DAYS, A WORK WHICH YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE, THOUGH SOMEONE SHOULD DESCRIBE IT TO YOU.' \" \n So heed Easyriders scriptural warnings well.

   "Sooo, the point under debate would be....?\n \n Oh, I see, you're just spamming the board with your religious drivel.\n\n T.Q, I suspect that this OP is in response to my point that EZ keeps making arguments that are rooted in the assumption that his position is correct, meaning that the arguments are effectively circular and don't really support a damn thing. What EZ doesn't seem to realize is that this post does exactly the same thing.\n \n I also pointed out the hilarity and hypocrisy of EZ's demanding that we heathens open our eyes so that we can at least understand viewpoints that we don't accept. The fact that EZ keeps posting this question-begging drivel demonstrates that he either can't or won't practice what he preaches.\n \n It's really just bonus that Christianity -- allegedly the way and the light according to a deity that loves everyone no matter what -- declares that even the kindest, most generous people will be tortured for all eternity merely for worshiping the wrong deity. Really, the standard lines are the fear-based apologetics that use the same basic tactic as terrorism: \"Do what we say, or fear the consequences.\" Fundy Christians in the U.S. are gung-ho about screaming bloody murder about Muslim terrorists and arguing that religion itself isn't to be blamed, yet it becomes clear that the rationale for this intellectual (or rather, non-intellectual) terrorism stems directly from the arguments that religion makes: Heathens will suffer.\n \n EZ, here's a hint to help you understand my point of view: When I read fiction, I don't believe it.",

What makes the most sense is that, at the very least, Matthew -- poor, dumb Matthew -- misread Zechariah and, in his zeal to make Jesus the fulfillment of prophecy, concocted this ridiculous story.\n\n \n \n This was your BEST ONE???\n \n Although most Christians would rather not concern themselves with some of the more minute details of Jesus&#8217; life reported in the New Testament, when challenged to defend the inerrancy of The Book that reports the beautiful story of Jesus, there are times when such details require our attention. Such is the case with Jesus&#8217; triumphal entry into Jerusalem during the final week of His life. People who wear the name of Christ enjoy reading of the crowd&#8217;s cries of &#8220;Hosanna!,&#8221; and meditating upon the fact that Jesus went to Jerusalem to bring salvation to the world. Skeptics, on the other hand, read of this event and cry, &#8220;Contradiction!&#8221; Allegedly, Matthew misunderstood Zechariah&#8217;s prophecy, and thus contradicted what Mark, Luke, and John wrote regarding Jesus&#8217; final entry into Jerusalem (see van den Heuvel, 2003). Matthew recorded the following:\n \n Now when they drew near Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, &#8220;Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Loose them and bring them to Me. And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, &#8216;The Lord has need of them,&#8217; and immediately he will send them.&#8221; All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: &#8220;Tell the daughter of Zion, &#8216;Behold, your King is coming to you, lowly, and sitting on a donkey, a colt, the foal of a donkey.&#8217; &#8221; So the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them. They brought the donkey and the colt, laid their clothes on them, and set Him on them. And a very great multitude spread their clothes on the road; others cut down branches from the trees and spread them on the road. Then the multitudes who went before and those who followed cried out, saying: &#8220;Hosanna to the Son of David! &#8216;Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!&#8217; Hosanna in the highest!&#8221; (Matthew 21:1-9, emp. added).\n \n Skeptics are quick to point out that the other gospel writers mention only &#8220;one colt,&#8221; which the disciples acquired, and upon which Jesus rode. Mark recorded that Jesus told the two disciples that they would find &#8220;a colt tied, on which no one has sat&#8221; (11:2). The disciples then &#8220;went their way, and found the colt tied by the door outside on the street, and they loosed it&#8230;. Then they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their clothes on it, and He sat on it&#8221; (Mark 11:4,7, emp. added; cf. Luke 19:29-38; John 12:12-16). Purportedly, &#8220;[t]he author of Matthew contradicts the author of Mark on the number of animals Jesus is riding into Jerusalem&#8221; (&#8220;Bible Contradictions,&#8221; 2003). Can these accounts be reconciled, or is this a legitimate contradiction?\n \n First, notice that Mark, Luke, and John did not say that only one donkey was obtained for Jesus, or that only one donkey traveled up to Jerusalem with Jesus. The writers simply mentioned one donkey (the colt). They never denied that another donkey (the mother of the colt) was present. The fact that Mark, Luke, and John mention one young donkey does not mean there were not two. If you had two friends named Joe and Bob who came to your house on Thursday night, but the next day while at work you mention to a fellow employee that Joe was at your house Thursday night (and you excluded Bob from the conversation for whatever reason), would you be lying? Of course not. You simply stated the fact that Joe was at your house. Similarly, when Mark, Luke, and John stated that a donkey was present, Matthew merely supplemented what the other writers recorded.\n \n Consider the other parts of the story that have been supplemented by one or more of the synoptic writers.\n \n Matthew was the only gospel writer to include Zechariah&#8217;s prophecy. \n Mark and Luke included the question that the owners&#8217; of the colt asked the disciples when they went to get the donkey for Jesus. Matthew excluded this information in his account.\n \n As one can see, throughout this story (and the rest of the gospel accounts for that matter), the writers consistently supplemented each other&#8217;s accounts. Such supplementation should be expected only from independent sources&#8212;some of whom were eyewitnesses. It is very possible that Matthew was specific in his numbering of the donkeys, due to the likelihood that he was an eyewitness of Jesus&#8217; final entrance into Jerusalem. (Bear in mind, Matthew was one of the twelve apostles; Mark and Luke were not.)\n \n Second, regarding the accusation that Matthew wrote of two donkeys, instead of just one, because he allegedly misunderstood Zechariah&#8217;s prophecy, it first must be noted that Zechariah&#8217;s prophecy actually mentions two donkeys (even though only one is stated as transporting the King to Jerusalem). The prophet wrote: &#8220;Behold, your King is coming to you&#8230;lowly and riding on a donkey [male], a colt, the foal of a donkey [female]&#8221; (Zechariah 9:9). In this verse, Zechariah used Hebrew poetic parallelism (the balancing of thought in successive lines of poetry). The terms male donkey, colt, and foal all designate the same animal&#8212;the young donkey upon which the King (Jesus) would ride into Jerusalem (Mark 11:7). Interestingly, even though the colt was the animal of primary importance, Zechariah also mentioned that this donkey was the foal of a female donkey. One might assume that Zechariah merely was stating the obvious when mentioning the mother&#8217;s existence. However, when Matthew&#8217;s gospel is taken into account, the elusive female donkey of Zechariah 9:9 is brought to light. Both the foal and the female donkey were brought to Christ at Mount Olivet, and both made the trip to Jerusalem. Since the colt never had been ridden, or even sat upon (as stated by Mark and Luke), its dependence upon its mother is very understandable (as implied by Matthew). The journey to Jerusalem, with multitudes of people in front of and behind Jesus and the donkeys (Matthew 21:8-9), obviously would have been much easier for the colt if the mother donkey were led nearby down the same road.\n \n The focal point of the skeptic&#8217;s proposed problem to Jesus&#8217; entry into Jerusalem is how He could have ridden on two donkeys at once. Since Matthew 21:7 states, &#8220;They brought the donkey and the colt, laid their clothes on them, and set Him on them&#8221; (NKJV), some have concluded that Matthew intended for his reader to understand Jesus as being some kind of stunt rider&#8212;proceeding to Jerusalem as more of a clown than a king. Such reasoning is preposterous. Matthew could have meant that Jesus rode the colt while the other donkey walked along with them. Instead of saying, &#8220;He rode one donkey and brought the other with Him,&#8221; the writer simply wrote that He rode &#8220;them&#8221; into Jerusalem. If a horse-owner came home to his wife and informed her that he had just ridden the horses home a few minutes ago from a nearby town, no one would accuse him of literally riding both horses at once. He merely was indicating to his wife that he literally rode one horse home, while the other one trotted alongside or behind him.\n \n A second possible solution to this &#8220;problem&#8221; is that Jesus did ride both donkeys, but He did so at different times. However unlikely this possibility might seem to some, nothing in Zechariah&#8217;s prophecy or the gospel accounts forbids such. Perhaps the colt found the triumphant procession that began on the southeastern slope of the Mount of Olives near the towns of Bethphage and Bethany (about 13/4 miles from Jerusalem&#8212;Pfeiffer, 1979, p. 197) too strenuous. Zechariah prophesied that Jesus would ride upon a colt (9:9), which Jesus did. He also easily could have ridden on the colt&#8217;s mother part of the way.\n \n Perhaps a more likely answer to the question, &#8220;How could Jesus sit &#8216;on them&#8217; (donkeys) during His march to Jerusalem?,&#8221; is that the second &#8220;them&#8221; of Matthew 21:7 may not be referring to the donkeys at all. Greek scholar A.T. Robertson believed that the second &#8220;them&#8221; (Greek &#945;&#965;&#964;&#969;&#957;) refers to the garments that the disciples laid on the donkeys, and not to the donkeys themselves. In commenting on Matthew 21:7 he stated: &#8220;The garments thrown on the animals were the outer garments (himatia), Jesus &#8216;took his seat&#8217; (epekathisen) upon the garments&#8221; (1930, 1:167). Skeptics do not want to allow for such an interpretation. When they read of &#8220;them&#8221; at the end of Matthew 21:7 (in the New King James Version), skeptics feel that the antecedent of this &#8220;them&#8221; must be the previous &#8220;them&#8221; (the donkeys). Critics like John Kesler (2003) also appeal to the other synoptic accounts (where Jesus is said to have sat upon &#8220;it&#8221;&#8212;the colt), and conclude that Matthew, like Mark and Luke, surely meant that Jesus sat upon the donkeys, and not just the disciples&#8217; clothes (which were on the donkeys). What critics like Kesler fail to acknowledge, however, is that in the Greek, Matthew&#8217;s word order is different than that of Mark and Luke. Whereas Mark and Luke indicated that the disciples put their clothes on the donkey, Matthew&#8217;s word order reads: &#8220;they put on the donkeys clothes.&#8221; The American Standard Version, among others (KJV, RSV, and NASB) is more literal in its translation of this verse than is the NKJV. It indicates that the disciples &#8220;brought the XXX, and the colt, and put on them their garments; and he sat thereon&#8221; (Matthew 21:7, ASV; cf. RSV, KJV, NASB). When Matthew wrote that Jesus sat &#8220;on them,&#8221; he easily could have intended for his readers to understand this &#8220;them&#8221; to refer to the clothes, and not to the donkeys. If the disciples&#8217; clothes were placed on both donkeys (as Matthew indicated), and then Jesus mounted the colt, one logically could conclude that Jesus sat on the clothes (which were placed upon the colt).\n \n One of the fundamental principles of nearly any study or investigation is that of being &#8220;innocent until proven guilty.&#8221; Any person or historical document is to be presumed internally consistent until it can be shown conclusively that it is contradictory. This approach has been accepted throughout literary history, and still is accepted today in most venues. The accepted way to critique any ancient writing is to assume innocence, not guilt. If we believe the Bible is innocent until proven guilty, then any possible answer should be good enough to nullify the charge of error. (This principle does not allow for just any answer, but any possible answer.) When a person studies the Bible and comes across passages that may seem contradictory at first glance (like the verses explained in this article&#8212;Matthew 21:1-9, Mark 11:1-11, Luke 19:29-38), he does not necessarily have to pin down the exact solution in order to show their truthfulness. The Bible student need only show the possibility of a harmonization among passages that appear to conflict, in order to negate the force of the charge that a Bible contradiction really exists. We act by this principle in the courtroom, in our treatment of various historical books, as well as in everyday-life situations. It is only fair, then, that we show the Bible the same courtesy by exhausting the search for possible harmony among passages before pronouncing one or more accounts false.\n \n Apologetics Press - A Donkey and Her Colt\n \n There is no contradiction. Certainly nothing that's been proven to be ficticious. And you certainly missed the bigger picture. JESUS DID RIDE INTO JERUSALEM. Just like HE DID RISE FROM THE DEAD. You miss the larger truths when you go hunting for alleged discrepancies. \n \n Just another exposee on how you haven't done your homework in looking into the matter. You probably got this from some other skeptic or their website that is also steeped in folly.",

The wording of Mark parallels the wording of Matthew, referencing the garmets after referencing the colt but still using the colt as the antecedent. In order to justify Matthew's reading as this \"scholar\" suggests, we have to accept that Matthew breaks with typical writing of the era (as demonstrated by Mark) in order to switch antecedents mid-sentence with no clarification. We then have to accept that Matthew decides that clarification is necessary in the following verse when he mentions the disciples' laying their garments \"in the way\"; in other words, we have to accept that Matthew executes a phantom switch of antecedents and then continues as if such a switch never took place. This is laughable at best, and plainly ridiculous: an example of the tortured logic I identified in my previous post.\n \n The highlight of my post is that a plain, non-biased reading produces a clear, absurd contradiction that can more reasonably be explained by \"Matthew\"'s writing not for recording history accurately but for concocting fulfillment of prophecy.\n \n \nWhen you wind up in the Pit...\n\n Ah, there's that loving Christian attitude we've all come to know and cherish.\n \n \nyou'll know it was due to mindless folly like you just presented.\n\n But it beats the pants off of your rubbish.

   "[QUOTE=Archangel;388217]\n 2Pe 3:9 The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.\n \nThe atheists and secular humanists must realize that God has clearly defined for us that although He is long suffering, His patience will not last forever. History is culminating in a finality which is leading to an inevitable judgement, and we were blessed as a generation to live toward the end of this journey of Gods plan for human redemption. These unbelievers must be warned that the time is short and Gods patience is running out and His wrath is about to be poured out upon all of mankind for our universal rebellion against His holiness as our one and only God and Creator.\n\n \n Nothing has been clearly defined. That is the problem, if the Church had any credibility left, had done it's job faithfully and if the bible wasn't so filled with inconsistencies then you could say clearly. What you should be doing is working to figure out what is really God's intent.\n \n \n[INDENT][I][FONT=&quot;Georgia&quot;][SIZE=&quot;3&quot;][COLOR=&quot;DarkRed&quot;]\n Jhn 3:16 \"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.\n\n \n Maybe this is just semantics, but we have eternal life if we don't believe in him. Granted it isn't supposed to be a good one, but it's there none the less and I don't see anything about happy or good in the above, just life.\n \n \nBoth the believer and the unbeliever have very real promises we can embrace. For the believer, it is that God will never leave or forsake us. For the unbeliever, it is that God will most assuredly pour out His wrath upon an unbelieving world.\n\n \n This is why it's so important to know what is right and what is wrong. Hoping or guessing probably isn't going to cut it.\n \n \n\n Act 13:40 \"Therefore take heed, so that the thing spoken of in the Prophets may not come upon {you:}\n Act 13:41 'BEHOLD, YOU SCOFFERS, AND MARVEL, AND PERISH; FOR I AM ACCOMPLISHING A WORK IN YOUR DAYS, A WORK WHICH YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE, THOUGH SOMEONE SHOULD DESCRIBE IT TO YOU.' \" \n\n \n Who has influenced Christianity more than Paul or deviated more from God?\n \n \nSo heed Easyriders scriptural warnings well. After all, he is only the messenger who is crying out in the wilderness of this spiritually dead world and warning you of the inevitable judgement which is coming soon.\n\n \n What if the Mormons are right or the Lutherans?

It means that even though all these people show there are fictitious stories in the New Testament, because both stories can't be right, you find a way to distort it in your own mind to bring them in 'harmony'. However, both those stories are FICTION. The entire New Testament is nothing but a series of Midrash.. (I.e. fictional stories).\n\n \n Your statements are based in ignorance. You have been misrepresenting these issues for as long as you've been posting. You've also lied about references, misrepresented Christianity, sided with sodomites against the Bible, and lied about the New Testament. You're a theologically-stunted loser.",

   "Show me where the resurrection was inserted and corrupted? Document it please.\n \n Not me. No Christian around here believes that. A bunch of leftists want to try to make Christ into some simple philosopher, and the atheists are simply into making his disciples and believers into liars and con-artists.\n\n \n \n \n ON WHAT DAY WAS JESUS CRUCIFIED?\n \n The resurrection is not relevant to the challenge which was open to anything significant and the response question is not predicated on if the resurrection occurred.\n \n Does the question fit within the parameters of your challenge? Yes it does. It was an event and is significant for at least three reasons. Jesus foretold of the number of days before he would be resurrected. Being described in all 4 Gospels if found to agree significantly strengthens the argument for Jesus and the credibility of the Gospel authors. Several important Christian beliefs and traditions are tied to the day which Jesus died. \n \n Jesus could be a philosopher. Could he not be more than one thing to different people? Is he not also referred to as teacher, as a man and rabbi?\n \n And no I only speculate that Paul was a liar and con-artist, but I hadn't mentioned that until now. Maybe it's prophecy\n \n \nAll four Gospels confirm the resurrection. Plus other epistles speak of it. Not one of the Gospels or epistles denies it. I think you need to start out and be an honest broker by acknowledging that (which you have yet to do).\n\n \n These are the responses that get you into situations like this. What are the odds that one of the Gospels or epistles is going to deny the resurrection? That would be one of the few things that would cause them to be in conflict than there currently are.\n \n As for you once again telling me I am dishonest or don't know what I am talking about or spreading false information is real easy to overcome. Whenever I do provide something other than your opinion with a reasonable and logical explanation why I wrong. You have not done that yet. You have said it without substantiating it.

   "How far did you look into this before you posted it? It's obvious the scriptures are talking about two separate things.\n \n THE ATHEIST'S COMPLAINT:\n \n Where did Jesus tell his disciples to go after his resurrection? Some texts say Galilee (Matthew 28:10; Mark 16:7), others say Jerusalem (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4). Is there a contradiction?\n \n RESPONSE:\n \n In Matthew 28:10 and Mark 16:7, the Lord's disciples are told immediately after Jesus' resurrection to meet Him in Galilee. They did so, and then spent many days with Him. \n \n In Luke 24:49 and Acts 1:4, just before ascending to heaven, Jesus told His disciples to wait in Jerusalem for \"the promise of the Father\". They did so, and on the day of Pentecost (recorded in Acts 2), they received the promise made. \n \n These are two separate instances, one immediately after the resurrection, and one immediately preceding the ascension. There is no contradiction.\n \n Looking Unto Jesus - Where did Jesus tell his disciples to go after his resurrection? - Limestone Church of Christ, Kingston, Ontario, Standing for New Testament Christianity, Bible, faith, Bible study, word of God, Christianity, Christian, church, t\n \n Matthew was telling the women where the disciples would see him after the resurrection.\n \n After the disciples had seen him after the resurrection (Luke 24:36), then he made his statement in Luke 24:49 about another (separate) promise for the disciples.\n \n Piece of cake.\n\n \nLuke 24\n 1Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them. \n 2And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. \n 3And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. \n 4And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: \n 5And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? \n 6He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, \n 7Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. \n 8And they remembered his words, \n 9And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest. \n 10It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles. \n 11And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not. \n 12Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass. \n 13And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs. \n 14And they talked together of all these things which had happened. \n 15And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. \n 16But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. \n 17And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? \n 18And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? \n 19And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: \n 20And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. \n 21But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. \n 22Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; \n 23And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. \n 24And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. \n 25Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: \n 26Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? \n 27And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. \n 28And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further. \n 29But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. \n 30And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. \n 31And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. \n 32And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? \n 33And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, \n 34Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. \n 35And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread. \n 36And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. \n 37But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. \n 38And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? \n 39Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. \n 40And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet. \n 41And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat? \n 42And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. \n 43And he took it, and did eat before them. \n 44And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. \n 45Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, \n 46And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: \n 47And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. \n 48And ye are witnesses of these things. \n 49And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high. \n 50And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. \n 51And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven. \n 52And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: \n 53And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.\n\n \n Synopsis of Luke from the visitation of the tomb to the ascension: The women go to the tomb on the first day, find out that jesus is not there and are told by two guys in shiny clothing that he had risen. They run back to tell the apostles, who at first don't believe them. Peter runs to the tomb to check it out. Cleopas and his buddy walk out to Emmaus, and jesus meets up with them and tags along. They convince jesus to stay with them since it is evening, and he agrees, even though at this point they still don't know it is jesus. (gotta wonder why they didn't question the holes in his hands and feet...but I digress) They sit down to eat, and jesus blesses the bread and gives it to them. They suddenly realize that it is jesus. They get up that same hour and run back to Jerusalem where the 11 are gathered. They start to tell the crowd that they sat down to eat and suddenly realized that the guy with them was jesus. All of the sudden, jesus appears in front of them. Jesus convinces them that he is really who he says he is, and they give him a piece of boiled fish and honeycomb. Jesus eats and tells them that they are to be his witnesses that the prophecies have been fulfilled. He tells them: And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high. He walks them out to Bethany (just outside Jerusalem), blesses them, and ascends to heaven. They go back to Jerusalem. \n \n \nMatthew 28\n 1In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre. \n 2And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. \n 3His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: \n 4And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men. \n 5And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. \n 6He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. \n 7And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you. \n 8And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word. \n 9And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him. \n 10Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me. \n 11Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done. \n 12And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, \n 13Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. \n 14And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you. \n 15So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day. \n 16Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. \n 17And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. \n 18And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. \n 19Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: \n 20Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.\n\n \n Synopsis of Matthew 28: The women go to the tomb, and are told by an angel that jesus is not there and has risen. They are told to go tell the apostles that jesus has risen and they should go to Galilee to see him. As they run to tell the apostles, jesus appears to them and tell them the same thing: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me. They go to the mountain in Galilee where they see jesus, even though some doubt it is him initially. Jesus tells them that they are to go out and teach his word. Nothing is mentioned by Matthew about the ascension. \n \n Now what sounds different about these stories to you? In one, jesus meets the apostles in Jerusalem, in the other, he meets them in Galilee.

   "Again, from Thomas Paine's Age of Reason:\nAccording to Matthew the eleven were marching to Galilee to meet Jesus in a mountain, by his own appointment, at the very time when, according to John, they were assembled in another place, and that not by appointment, but in secret, for fear of the Jews.\n \n The writer of the book of Luke contradicts that of Matthew more pointedly than John does; for he says expressly that the meeting was in Jerusalem the evening of the same day that he [Christ] rose, and that the eleven were there. See Luke, chap. xxiv, ver. 13, 33.\n \n Now, it is not possible, unless we admit these supposed disciples the right of willful lying, that the writer of those books could be any of the eleven persons called disciples; for if, according to Matthew, the eleven went into Galilee to meet Jesus in a mountain by his own appointment on the same day that he is said to have risen, Luke and John must have been two of that eleven; yet the writer of Luke says expressly, and John implies as much, that the meeting was that same day, in a house in Jerusalem; and, on the other hand, if, according to Luke and John, the eleven were assembled in a house in Jerusalem, Matthew must have been one of that eleven; yet Matthew says the meeting was in a mountain in Galilee, and consequently the evidence given in those books destroys each other.\n \n The writer of the book of Mark says nothing about any meeting in Galilee; but he says, chap. xvi, ver. 12, that Christ, after his resurrection, appeared in t the o ther books say nothing about any eart into the country, and that these two told it to the residue, who would not believe them. Luke also tells a story in which he keeps Christ employed the whole day of this pretended resurrection, until the evening, and which totally invalidates the account of going to the mountain in Galilee. He says that two of them, without saying which two, went that same day to a village call Emmaus, three score furlongs (seven miles and a half) from Jerusalem, and that Christ, in disguise, went with them, and stayed with them unto the evening, and supped with them, and then vanished out of their sight, and re-appeared that same evening at the meeting of the eleven in Jerusalem.\n \n This is the contradictory manner in which the evidence of this pretended re-appearance of Christ is stated; the only point in which the writers agree, is the skulking privacy of that re-appearance; for whether it was in the recess of a mountain in Galilee, or a shut-up house in Jerusalem, it was still skulking. To what cause, then, are we to assign this skulking? On the one hand it is directly repugnant to the supposed or pretended end - that of convincing the world that Christ had risen; and on the other hand, to have asserted the publicity of it would have exposed the writers of those books to public detection, and, therefore, they have been under the necessity of making it a private affair.\n As you can see, the contradiction is not the product of nefarious, modern, anti-religious, hell-bent word-twisting, but was commented upon by one of the primary influences on this country's birth over 200 years ago. \n \n Maybe it's me, but I tend to credit Paine's analysis of the Scriptures over those of our own time's awake-all-night religious internet whackos.",

   "What was your other claim-to-fame \"contradiction\" you're so proud of? Can't wait to bust it.\n\n You have yet to bust this one. You don't get another to work on until I get an admission that there is a contradiction on this one. Let's examine what you are trying to say a little more closely. \n \n \nIn Matthew 28:10 and Mark 16:7, the Lord's disciples are told immediately after Jesus' resurrection to meet Him in Galilee. They did so, and then spent many days with Him. \n \n The Gospel of Matthew confirms the disciples saw him in Galilee:\n \n Matthew 28:16 Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. 17When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. 18Then Jesus came to them and said, \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in[a] the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.\"\n\n Yes, that indeed is what Matthew say's, and I have not disputed that. I am not disputing what Luke says either...since the whole point I am trying to make is that luke directly contradicts Matthew. \n \n \nAfter the disciples had seen him AFTER the resurrection (Luke 24:36), then he made his statement LATER in Luke 24:49 about another (separate) promise for the disciples in Jerusalem.\n\n This is where you are wrong. Luke 24:36 makes it quite clear that the disciples see jesus the day of the resurrection in Jerusalem...not Galilee. It is also quite clear that Luke 24:49 occurs in the same spot where they met jesus...in Jerusalem...the day of his resurrection. And I quote:\n \n \n 1Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre [the sepulchre being in Jerusalem], bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them. \n \n 2And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. [The same sepulchre, in Jerusalem] \n 3And they entered in [the sepulchre, in Jerusalem], and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. \n \n 4And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: [at the sepulchre, in Jerusalem]\n \n 5And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? \n \n 6He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, \n \n 7Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. [as in that day, when they were standing at the sepulchre, in Jerusalem]\n \n 8And they remembered his words, \n \n 9And returned from the sepulchre [the one in Jerusalem], and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest. \n \n 10It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles. \n \n 11And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not. [meaning they didn't believe the women, because they had not yet seen jesus for themselves]\n \n 12Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre [the one in Jerusalem]; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass. \n \n 13And, behold, two of them went that same day [as in the same day the women went to the sepulchre, in Jerusalem, being the same day of the resurrection] to a village called Emmaus [just outside of Jerusalem, home of the sepulchre], which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs [see, I told you]. \n \n 14And they talked together of all these things which had happened. \n \n 15And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them [on the road from Jerusalem, home of the sepulchre, to Emmaus]. \n \n 16But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. \n \n 17And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? \n \n 18And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? \n \n 19And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: \n \n 20And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. \n \n 21But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done [as in the day of the resurection, in Jerusalem, home of the sepulchre]. \n \n 22Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre [that day, in Jerusalem]; \n \n 23And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. \n \n 24And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre [the one in Jerusalem], and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. \n \n 25Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: \n \n 26Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? \n \n 27And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. \n \n 28And they drew nigh unto the village [Emmaus, just outside of Jerusalem], whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further. \n \n 29But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent [the day of the resurrection]. And he went in to tarry with them. \n \n 30And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. \n \n 31And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. \n \n 32And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? \n \n 33And they rose up the same hour [the same hour, on the day of the resurrection], and returned to Jerusalem [Jerusalem], and found the eleven gathered together [In Jerusalem], and them that were with them, \n \n 34Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. \n \n 35And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread. \n \n 36And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them [in Jerusalem], and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. \n \n 37But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit [because this was the first time they had seen jesus since the resurrection]. \n \n 38And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? \n \n 39Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. \n \n 40And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet. \n \n 41And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat? \n \n 42And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. \n \n 43And he took it, and did eat before them. \n \n 44And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. \n \n 45Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, \n \n 46And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day [the same day he was standing there with them, in Jerusalem]: \n \n 47And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem [where they currently are, Jerusalem]. \n \n 48And ye are witnesses of these things. \n \n 49And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem [meaning stay where you are...in Jerusalem], until ye be endued with power from on high. \n \n 50And he led them out as far as to Bethany [just outsdie of Jerusalem], and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. \n \n 51And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven [jesus gone...bye bye jesus]. \n \n 52And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem [from Bethany, just outsdie of Jerusalem] with great joy: \n \n 53And were continually in the temple [In Jerusalem], praising and blessing God. Amen.\n\n \n \nThese are two separate instances, one immediately after the resurrection, and one immediately preceding the ascension. There is no contradiction.\n\n Clearly there is a contradiction. I'm not making this up...I am using the actual text from the bible for you to see. \n \n \nI think you're under the impression that the Gospels cannot be complementary. You think it's either Matthew OR Luke. It's not. \n\n I'm not saying the they cannot be complementary, but they should agree on the basic facts...which they do not. \n \n \nAnd I am done with that. \n\n \n You give up?",

   "From Wikipedia (and footnoted to other sites equally, no doubt, atheistically biased... like the Catholic Encyclopedia): \nThe first modern site identification of Emmaus was by the explorer Edward Robinson, who equated it with the Palestinian Arab village of Imwas. Before its destruction in 1967, the village of Imwas was located at the end of the Ayalon Valley, on the border of the hill country of Judah, at 153 stadia (18.6 miles) from Jerusalem via the Kiryat Yearim Ridge Route, 161 stadia (19.6 miles) via the Beth-Horon Ridge Route and 1,600 feet (490 m) lower by elevation.\n \n Eusebius was probably the first to mention Nicopolis as biblical Emmaus in his Onomasticon. Jerome, who translated Eusebius' book, implied in his letter 108 that there was a church in Nicopolis built in the house of Cleopas where Jesus broke bread on that late journey. From the 4th century on, the site was commonly identified as the biblical Emmaus.\n \n Archaeologically, many remains have been excavated at the site of the former Palestinian village, now located inside Canada Park, which support historical and traditional claims. Five structures were found and dated, including a Christian basilica from the 3rd century, another basilica from the 6th century and a 12th century Crusader church.[3] Emmaus Nicopolis is a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church.\n Emmaus - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n And... \nGalilee (Hebrew: &#1492;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#8206; ha-Galil, lit: the province, Latin: Galileia, Arabic: &#1575;&#1604;&#1580;&#1604;&#1610;&#1604;&#8206; al-Jaleel), is a large region in northern Israel which overlaps with much of the administrative North District of the country. Traditionally divided into Upper Galilee (Hebrew: &#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;&#8206; Galil Elyon), Lower Galilee (Hebrew: &#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; &#1514;&#1495;&#1514;&#1493;&#1503;&#8206; Galil Takhton), and Western Galilee (Hebrew: &#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500; &#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#8206; Galil Maaravi), extending from Dan to the north, at the base of Mount Hermon, along Mount Lebanon to the ridges of Mount Carmel and Mount Gilboa to the south, and from the Jordan Rift Valley to the east across the plains of the Jezreel Valley and Acre to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and the Coastal Plain in the west.\nGalilee - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Don't see much correlation there.",

   "Similarly, Jesus met with His disciples both in Jerusalem and in Galilee, but at different times. On the day of His resurrection, He met with all of the apostles (except Thomas) in Jerusalem just as both Luke and John recorded (Luke 24:33-43; John 20:19-25). Since Jesus was on the Earth for only forty days following His resurrection (cf. Acts 1:3), sometime between this meeting with His apostles in Jerusalem and His ascension more than five weeks later, Jesus met with seven of His disciples at the Sea of Tiberias in Galilee (John 21:1-14), and later with all eleven of the apostles on a mountain in Galilee that Jesus earlier had appointed for them (Matthew 28:16). Sometime following these meetings in Galilee, Jesus and His disciples traveled back to Judea, where He ascended into heaven from the Mount of Olives near Bethany (Luke 24:50-53; Acts 1:9-12).\n \n None of the accounts of Jesus&#8217; post-resurrection appearances contradicts another. Rather, each writer supplemented what a different writer left out. Jesus may have appeared to the disciples a number of times during the forty days on Earth after His resurrection (cf. 1 Corinthians 15:1-7), while the New Testament writers mentioned only the more prominent instances in order to substantiate the fact of His resurrection.\n \n Still, one may ask, &#8220;Why did Jesus command His apostles to &#8216;tarry in the city of Jerusalem&#8217; on the day of His resurrection until they were &#8216;endued with power from on high&#8217; (Luke 24:49), if He really wanted them to meet Him in Galilee?&#8221; Actually, it is an assumption to assert that Jesus made the above statement on the same day that He arose from the grave. One thing we must keep in mind as we study the Bible is that it normally is not as concerned about chronology as modern-day writings. Frequently (especially in the gospel accounts), writers went from one subject to the next without giving the actual time or the exact order in which something was done or taught (cf. Luke 4:1-3; Matthew 4:1-11). In Luke 24, the writer omitted the post-resurrection appearances of Jesus in Galilee (mentioned by both Matthew and John). However, notice that he never stated that Jesus remained only in Jerusalem from the day He rose from the grave until the day He ascended up into heaven.\n \n According to Luke 24 verses 1,13,21,29, and 33, the events recorded in the first forty-three verses of that chapter all took place on the very day of Jesus&#8217; resurrection (cf. 24:1,13,21,29,33). The last four verses of Luke 24 (vss. 50-53), however, took place (according to Luke) more than five weeks later (cf. Acts 1:1-12). But what about verses 44-49? When were these statements made? The truth is, no one can know for sure. Luke gives no indication (as he did in the preceding verses) that this particular section took place &#8220;on the first day of the week&#8221; (24:1), or on &#8220;the third day&#8221; since Jesus&#8217; crucifixion (24:21). All we know is that verses 44-49 took place sometime before He ascended into heaven (vss. 50-51). Simply because Luke used the Greek conjunctive particle de [translated &#8220;and&#8221; (ASV), &#8220;then&#8221; (NKJV), and &#8220;now&#8221; (NASV)] to begin verse 44, does not necessarily denote a close connection between the two verses, but only a general continuation of the account and a brief statement of what Jesus said. Even though many twenty-first-century readers assume that the events recorded in Luke 24:44-49 occurred on the very day Jesus rose from the grave, the text actually is silent on the matter.\n \n Apologetics Press - To Galilee or Jerusalem?\n \n The question is: Did Jesus say he would FIRST meet with the disciples in either Jerusalem or Galilee? Did he say one was supposed to be FIRST? If so, which one, and what scripture # is it that says that that particular place would be FIRST? If not, there is no contradiction.

Emmaus was not Galilee. \n \n \nIn addition, it is unclear from the scriptures when it says in Luke 24:33 \"They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem...\" that that's the same day as the resurrection.

Galilee is much farther north than 7 miles. \n \n Luke makes it clear that the 2 disciples who went to Emmaus and talked with jesus got up and returned to jerusalem \"that same hour\". One could walk 7 miles in 3 hours easily... one could imagine even faster if you had something important to tell 11 people. \n \n According to Matthew, jesus meets and speaks to the eleven in Galilee.

Judas runs off and hangs himself. The priest know that they cannot return the silver to the treasury, as it is \"blood money\", so they take it and buy the Potter's field with the money.

   "Similarly, Jesus met with His disciples both in Jerusalem and in Galilee, but at different times. On the day of His resurrection, He met with all of the apostles (except Thomas) in Jerusalem just as both Luke and John recorded (Luke 24:33-43; John 20:19-25). Since Jesus was on the Earth for only forty days following His resurrection (cf. Acts 1:3), sometime between this meeting with His apostles in Jerusalem and His ascension more than five weeks later, Jesus met with seven of His disciples at the Sea of Tiberias in Galilee (John 21:1-14), and later with all eleven of the apostles on a mountain in Galilee that Jesus earlier had appointed for them (Matthew 28:16). Sometime following these meetings in Galilee, Jesus and His disciples traveled back to Judea, where He ascended into heaven from the Mount of Olives near Bethany (Luke 24:50-53; Acts 1:9-12).\n \n None of the accounts of Jesus' post-resurrection appearances contradicts another. Rather, each writer supplemented what a different writer left out. Jesus may have appeared to the disciples a number of times during the forty days on Earth after His resurrection (cf. 1 Corinthians 15:1-7), while the New Testament writers mentioned only the more prominent instances in order to substantiate the fact of His resurrection.\n \n Still, one may ask, \"Why did Jesus command His apostles to 'tarry in the city of Jerusalem' on the day of His resurrection until they were 'endued with power from on high' (Luke 24:49), if He really wanted them to meet Him in Galilee?\" Actually, it is an assumption to assert that Jesus made the above statement on the same day that He arose from the grave. One thing we must keep in mind as we study the Bible is that it normally is not as concerned about chronology as modern-day writings. Frequently (especially in the gospel accounts), writers went from one subject to the next without giving the actual time or the exact order in which something was done or taught (cf. Luke 4:1-3; Matthew 4:1-11). In Luke 24, the writer omitted the post-resurrection appearances of Jesus in Galilee (mentioned by both Matthew and John). However, notice that he never stated that Jesus remained only in Jerusalem from the day He rose from the grave until the day He ascended up into heaven.\n \n According to Luke 24 verses 1,13,21,29, and 33, the events recorded in the first forty-three verses of that chapter all took place on the very day of Jesus' resurrection (cf. 24:1,13,21,29,33). The last four verses of Luke 24 (vss. 50-53), however, took place (according to Luke) more than five weeks later (cf. Acts 1:1-12). But what about verses 44-49? When were these statements made? The truth is, no one can know for sure. Luke gives no indication (as he did in the preceding verses) that this particular section took place \"on the first day of the week\" (24:1), or on \"the third day\" since Jesus' crucifixion (24:21). All we know is that verses 44-49 took place sometime before He ascended into heaven (vss. 50-51). Simply because Luke used the Greek conjunctive particle de [translated \"and\" (ASV), \"then\" (NKJV), and \"now\" (NASV)] to begin verse 44, does not necessarily denote a close connection between the two verses, but only a general continuation of the account and a brief statement of what Jesus said. Even though many twenty-first-century readers assume that the events recorded in Luke 24:44-49 occurred on the very day Jesus rose from the grave, the text actually is silent on the matter.\n \n Apologetics Press - To Galilee or Jerusalem?\n \n The question is: Did Jesus say he would FIRST meet with the disciples in either Jerusalem or Galilee? Did he say one was supposed to be FIRST? If so, which one, and what scripture # is it that says that that particular place would be FIRST? If not, there is no contradiction. I'll check back tomorrow.\n\n \n Just wanted to clarify the above sentence. Haven't you stated a number of times that the Gospels are 4 independent accounts of Jesus' life and ministry? The sentence in question, which you have given as an authoritative source, doesn't seem to agree with you about that. Any comment?

   "And why won't you answer question 3 (the most glaring of all contradictions)? There is no real way to explain that one away...is there? \n\n \n Sure there is. And you didn't look very hard either, like I suggested. I just wanted the world to see that you are lazy. \n \n From Apologetics Press:\n \n Since Matthew 27:5-6 says the chief priests used the betrayal money that Judas threw on the temple floor to purchase the potter&#8217;s field, critics contend that a contradiction exists because Acts 1:18 indicates that Judas purchased the field with the blood money. Obviously, Judas could not have purchased the field because he gave the 30 pieces of silver back to the priests before hanging himself. Thus, to say that Judas bought the potter&#8217;s field is incorrect&#8230;right? Wrong!\n \n I suppose if common sense and unbiased reasoning were omitted from this discussion, then one might conclude that these differences represent a legitimate contradiction. If one believes it is wrong to say a father bought a car for his son, when in actuality the son purchased the car with $5,000 his father gave him, then I suppose that Acts 1:18 and Matthew 27:5-6 are contradictory. If one believes that it is wrong to say an employer purchased a meal for his staff, when it really was one of the employees who handed the money to the waiter, then the events recorded in Acts 1:18 could be considered fictitious. But what reasonable person would reach such conclusions as these? \n \n Acts 1:18 simply informs us that Judas furnished the means of purchasing the field. One is not forced to conclude that Judas personally bought the potter&#8217;s field. As in modern-day writings and speeches, it is very common for the Scriptures to represent a man as doing a thing when, in fact, he merely supplies the means for doing it. For example, Joseph spoke of his brothers as selling him into Egypt (Genesis 45:4-5; cf. Acts 7:9), when actually they sold him to the Ishmaelites (who then sold him into Egypt). John mentions that &#8220;the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John (though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples)&#8221; (John 4:1-3). And when the Bible says, &#8220;Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him&#8221; (John 19:1), most people understand that he simply ordered Jesus to be scourged, not that he actually did the scourging himself. The same principle is recognized in law in the well-known Latin maxim, &#8220;Qui facit per alium, facit per se&#8221; (&#8220;he who acts through another is deemed in law to do it himself&#8221;).\n \n Whether one says that Judas &#8220;purchased a field with the wages of iniquity&#8221; (Acts 1:18), or that the chief priests &#8220;bought with them the potter&#8217;s field&#8221; (Matthew 27:7), he has stated the same truth, only in different ways.\n \n Apologetics Press - Who Bought the Potter&#8217;s Field?\n \n \n Because I am intelligent enough to realize that it could not have been both (David and Jeremiah). It is one or the other. Nice try.\n\n \n That won't cut it. You'll have to come up with some good reason why 2 different prophets couldn't have prophesied on that. Perhaps your godless bias is clouding your judgment.\n \n \n\n That explanation is nothing short of pathetic. Regardless, it still doesn't change the fact that Matthew says one thing and Acts says another.\n\n \n Complementary accounts, Jack. Don't give me that \"either or\" rubbish.

   "Sure there is. And you didn't look very hard either, like I suggested. I just wanted the world to see that you are lazy. \n \n From Apologetics Press:\n \n Since Matthew 27:5-6 says the chief priests used the betrayal money that Judas threw on the temple floor to purchase the potter's field, critics contend that a contradiction exists because Acts 1:18 indicates that Judas purchased the field with the blood money. Obviously, Judas could not have purchased the field because he gave the 30 pieces of silver back to the priests before hanging himself. Thus, to say that Judas bought the potter's field is incorrect...right? Wrong!\n \n I suppose if common sense and unbiased reasoning were omitted from this discussion, then one might conclude that these differences represent a legitimate contradiction. If one believes it is wrong to say a father bought a car for his son, when in actuality the son purchased the car with $5,000 his father gave him, then I suppose that Acts 1:18 and Matthew 27:5-6 are contradictory. If one believes that it is wrong to say an employer purchased a meal for his staff, when it really was one of the employees who handed the money to the waiter, then the events recorded in Acts 1:18 could be considered fictitious. But what reasonable person would reach such conclusions as these? \n \n Acts 1:18 simply informs us that Judas furnished the means of purchasing the field. One is not forced to conclude that Judas personally bought the potter's field. As in modern-day writings and speeches, it is very common for the Scriptures to represent a man as doing a thing when, in fact, he merely supplies the means for doing it. For example, Joseph spoke of his brothers as selling him into Egypt (Genesis 45:4-5; cf. Acts 7:9), when actually they sold him to the Ishmaelites (who then sold him into Egypt). John mentions that \"the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John (though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples)\" (John 4:1-3). And when the Bible says, \"Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him\" (John 19:1), most people understand that he simply ordered Jesus to be scourged, not that he actually did the scourging himself. The same principle is recognized in law in the well-known Latin maxim, \"Qui facit per alium, facit per se\" (\"he who acts through another is deemed in law to do it himself\").\n \n Whether one says that Judas \"purchased a field with the wages of iniquity\" (Acts 1:18), or that the chief priests \"bought with them the potter's field\" (Matthew 27:7), he has stated the same truth, only in different ways.\n \n Apologetics Press - Who Bought the Potter's Field?\n\n Really? That's the best you could do? The Apologetics Press? LOL. Ok, if that's the best you can do. emoticon_rolleyes Frankly, I think it is pathetic. Why are you so unwilling to admit that the bible contains contradictions? \n \n \nComplementary accounts, Jack. Don't give me that \"either or\" rubbish. That's why you have such a stunted view of things on issues like this.\n\n Weren't you the one who claimed the NT as \"multiple and independent\" sources of verification? Now you are saying that they are \"complimentary and interdependent\". Are you serious? \n \n \nYou may have read the Bible, but Satan knows scripture too, and he's still deluded also.\n\n So I'm like satan?\n \n \nLet me tell you what your problem is: \n \n \"The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.\" - 1 Corinthians 2:14 (New International Version)\n\n Yep...that's my problem. I guess god screwed up and created me without a spirit. \n \n \n \nIt's up above, and you're busted on all 3 of your arguments. \n \n No Easy, I'm not. Dismissing logical arguments with rediculous hypothetical conjecture does not \"bust\" the argument. \n \n \nJesus is Lord!!\n\n Good for him.",

The idea that Homer was responsible for just the two outstanding epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey, did not win consensus until 350 BC.[38] While many find it unlikely that both epics were composed by the same person, others argue that the stylistic similarities are too consistent to support the theory of multiple authorship. One view which attempts to bridge the differences holds that the Iliad was composed by \"Homer\" in his maturity, while the Odyssey was a work of his old age. The Batrachomyomachia, Homeric Hymns and cyclic epics are generally agreed to be later than the Iliad and the Odyssey.\n \n Most scholars agree that the Iliad and Odyssey underwent a process of standardisation and refinement out of older material beginning in the 8th century BC. An important role in this standardisation appears to have been played by the Athenian tyrant Hipparchus, who reformed the recitation of Homeric poetry at the Panathenaic festival. Many classicists hold that this reform must have involved the production of a canonical written text. wiki\n \n As with all ancient documents, scholars today argue over their authenticity.

End of story.\n \n Let's face it also that, given the above, 'proving' the resurrection never happened is impossible by any means available either.\n\n \n I agree that given what is available to date it cannot be said without doubt if the events happened, happened as described, did not happen at all or are partially accurate. Many Christians seem unwilling to accept this though, as if to do so undermines their faith. They seem willing to hold onto defend or deny any attempts to reach a conclusive (if possible) end to such questions.\n \n \n \nOn the other hand, the fact that the Apostles went from cowed and fearful men upon the death of their Messiah, to absolute Lion's of God only a few days afterwards and later became veritable martyrs in the name of Christ, if not proof, certainly indicates some authenticity. \n \n Do not forget that not only the recorded Apostles were responsible for spreading the word, but also, those hundreds of people whom it was recorded in the Gospels as having seen Christ upon His resurrection. These people fervently believed what they saw and Rome felt that belief dangerous enough to feed them to the lions.\n\n \n And the followers of Mohamed, Buddha and Krishna as well as the Jews would have an equal if not better claim. The actions of believers or the survival of the belief I don't think carries much weight in this case. Of course it's not meaningless, but just not as meaningful given the history of it. This is where the credibility of the early church has caused the most damage and having done it to themselves I don't see it being overcome easily.",

   "Oh, my.. You make claims, and don't want to present your evidence. When I look up to see what we have that is more than just Christian claims about the Appostles , I see conflicting claims among Christian sources, and no secular sources.\n \n You do make such wonderful straw men. I accept the bible exists, but, it has the earmarks of a narrative story, rather than historical reality. I use the same criteria for that evaluation that I would for any other ancient writing. \n \n There is this little thing missing known as 'convergence of evidence' when it comes to the stories in the New Testament. The old testament is missing much of that also, but has a lot more when it comes to certain aspects.\n \n Let's see, we have the illiad and the oddesy, we have the works of Sirach. We have the letters of Philo of Alexandria , which are older than the Gospels.\n We even have copies of the essays of Archimedes where he describes his method of figuring out volumes of spheres and cones. \n \n You are also making the logical mistake that if we have 'lots of copies' of a series of books that it means those books were true to begin with.\n\n \n Totally off topic, but interesting side note. Archimedes writings were kept safe by the Church. Not out of respect for the knowledge, but because his book was torn in half the writing bleached/washed out, turned sideways and made into a prayer book. \n \n How much farther our civilization would be had this knowledge been available to someone like Newton can only be speculated.

   "Probably be screaming his name like the 13 year old cheerleader Easy appears to have become.\n \n That is probably an exaggeration, I don't scream and Easy isn't that old, but still yes.\n\n \n If you even remotely knew about the Holy Spirit and Jesus Christ you would be dancing like King David. But you're immature in your spirit, so what do you know?\n \n \nAnd if it could be shown beyond doubt it wasn't would you accept it? What about parts of it? Say remove all of Paul.\n\n \n Why remove Paul? He and Jesus have much in common, or didn't you know?\n \n Did Jesus and Paul teach the same thing?\n \n Some critics of Christianity try and set Paul against Jesus. They will often claim that what Paul taught is not what Jesus said and that present-day Christianity is derived not from Jesus, but from Paul's teaching. This is an erroneous claim that does not fit the facts. It is easy to take various scriptures out of context and try and set one person against another -- as many critics of Christianity have done. Nevertheless, we can confidently expect that Jesus and Paul taught the same thing. Granted, Paul focused more on theological issues than Jesus did, but nothing Paul said is contrary to Christ. \n \n Luke wrote both the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts. In Acts 9 Luke records the events surrounding Paul's conversion. We see that Jesus himself called Paul and sent him to be an apostle. If Paul and Jesus are not in agreement, then why would Jesus call Paul to be his apostle? Jesus is God in flesh and would therefore know all things. Jesus would certainly have known what Paul would teach which, it seems, is one of the reasons Jesus called him.\n \n In addition, we can quickly see by examining what Jesus said and finding parallels in what Paul said. Following is a brief alphabetical list comparing the words of Christ with the words of Paul. We can clearly see that they were indeed in agreement and that the critics who would set Paul against Christ don't know what they're talking about.\n \n Alive in Christ\n \n Jesus\n \"For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes,\" (John 5:21). \n \n Paul\n \"For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive,\" (1 Cor. 15:22). \n \n Anxiety\n \n Jesus\n \"For this reason I say to you, do not be anxious for your life, as to what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor for your body, as to what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body than clothing?\" (Matt. 6:25). \n \n Paul\n \"Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God,\" (Phil. 4:6). \n \n Atonement\n \n Jesus\n \"I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep,\" (John 10:11) \n \n Paul\n \"and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you, and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma,\" (Eph. 5:2).\n \n Deity of Jesus\n \n Jesus\n \"Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am,\" (John 8:58). Compare with Exodus 3:14, \"And God said to Moses, \"I AM WHO I AM\"; and He said, \"Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'I AM has sent me to you.'\"\n \n Paul \n \"For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form,\" (Col. 2:9). See also, Phil. 2:5-8. \n \n Forgiveness\n \n Jesus\n \"For if you forgive men for their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you,\" (Matt. 6:14). \n \n Paul\n \"And be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you,\" (Eph. 4:32).\n \n Jesus is the only way\n \n Jesus\n \"Jesus *said to him, \"I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but through Me,\" (John 14:6). \n \n Paul\n \"For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,\" (1 Tim. 2:5). \n \n Justification by faith\n \n Jesus\n \"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life,\" (John 5:24). See also John 3:16-18; Luke 18:9-13. \n \n Paul\n \"Therefore having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,\" (Rom. 5:1). \n \n The Law\n \n Jesus\n \"Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill,\" (Matt. 5:17).\n \n Paul\n \"Do we then nullify the Law through faith? May it never be! On the contrary, we establish the Law,\" (Rom. 3:31).\n \n \"What I am saying is this: the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise,\" (Gal. 3:17). \n \n Living the Law\n \n Jesus\n \"You shall not commit murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; 19 Honor your father and mother; and You shall love your neighbor as yourself,\" (Matt. 19:18).\n \n Paul\n \"Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law. 9 For this, \"You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,\" and if there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this saying, \"You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\" 10 Love does no wrong to a neighbor; love therefore is the fulfillment of the law,\" (Rom. 13:8-10) \n \n Resurrection\n \n Jesus\n \"The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men; 23 and they will kill Him, and He will be raised on the third day,\" (Matt. 17:22-23). \n \n Paul\n \"For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,\" (1 Cor. 15:3-4).\n \n Rewards and Punishment\n \n Jesus\n \"For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father with His angels; and will then recompense every man according to his deeds,\" (Matt. 16:27). \n \n Paul\n \"who will render to every man according to his deeds,\" (Rom. 2:6).\n \n Sinfulness of man\n \n Jesus\n \"For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, slanders. 20 \"These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man,\" (Matt. 15:19). \n \n Paul\n \"There is none who understands, There is none who seeks for God; 12 All have turned aside, together they have become useless; There is none who does good, There is not even one,\" (Rom. 3:11-12). \n \n Tradition\n \n Jesus\n \"And why do you yourselves transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?\" (Matt. 15:3).\n \n Paul\n \"See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ,\" (Col. 2:8). \n \n Works Righteousness denied\n \n Jesus\n \"Many will say to Me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?' 23 \"And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness,\" (Matt. 7:22-23).\n \n Paul\n \"Now that no one is justified by the Law before God is evident; for, \"The righteous man shall live by faith,\" (Gal. 3:11). \n \n Did Jesus and Paul teach the same thing? | Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry\n \n You didn't know all this, did you?

   "Really? The idea that Homer was responsible for just the two outstanding epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey, did not win consensus until 350 BC.[38] While many find it unlikely that both epics were composed by the same person, others argue that the stylistic similarities are too consistent to support the theory of multiple authorship. One view which attempts to bridge the differences holds that the Iliad was composed by \"Homer\" in his maturity, while the Odyssey was a work of his old age. The Batrachomyomachia, Homeric Hymns and cyclic epics are generally agreed to be later than the Iliad and the Odyssey.\n \n Most scholars agree that the Iliad and Odyssey underwent a process of standardisation and refinement out of older material beginning in the 8th century BC. An important role in this standardisation appears to have been played by the Athenian tyrant Hipparchus, who reformed the recitation of Homeric poetry at the Panathenaic festival. Many classicists hold that this reform must have involved the production of a canonical written text. wiki\n \n As with all ancient documents, scholars today argue over their authenticity.

Had it been the prophets who (as we are told) had formerly prophesied of these things, they must have had a great deal to say. They could have told us everything, and we should have had posthumous prophecies, with notes and commentaries upon the first, a little better at least than we have now. Had it been Moses, and Aaron, and Joshua, and Samuel, and David, not an unconverted Jew had remained in all Jerusalem. Had it been John the Baptist, and the saints of the times then present, everybody would have known them, and they would have out-preached and out-famed all the other apostles. But, instead of this, these saints are made to pop up, like Jonah's gourd in the night, for no purpose at all but to wither in the morning. -- Thus much for this part of the story.\n",

Only through faith in Christ can one be redeemed.\n \n And like I stated earlier this is my personal belief.

   "Pappillion -\n \n I'd like to see you read this because it's how believers are justified / declared righteous in Christ. It's extremely important.\n \n JUSTIFICATION\n \n Justification: \"1: the act, process, or state of being justified by God; 2. the act or an instance of justifying.\" (Webster 628)\n \n Justification: \"To justify or make just, by which sanctification is included under justification; to set right; correct a wrong thing done; to deem right or approve. Justification is, in Pauline language, synonymous with reconciliation. God is not imputing to men their trespasses, but declaring them righteous. The means (of justification) is the vicarious expiatory death of Jesus Christ. The sole condition is faith ... in Jesus Christ.\" (Hastings 510)\n \n Justification: \"To prove or show to be just; to vindicate as right; to declare free from guilt or blame; to absolve, to clear; to pardon or clear from guilt; to acquit; declare righteous; pronounce sentence of acceptance.\" (Conner 269) Conner goes on to quote J.R. Gregory (\"The Theological Student\"), who defines justification as, 'That act of God by which He accepts as righteous the penitent sinner who believes on Christ for salvation.\"\n \n With the above definitions and quotes as our starting point, we can now delve into one of the most dynamic and unselfish works in the history of creation - the work of Jesus Christ, who became our righteousness because we had none of our own. Author Kevin Conner explains it this way:\n \n \"When Adam sinned, all that he was and all that he did was 'imputed' to the whole, unborn human race. Sin left a debit on the books (Genesis 3:1-16; 2:17; Romans 5:12; 6:23). In Adam all sinned, and all died, spiritually and physically (I Corinthians 15:22). When Christ died on Calvary, the sin of Adam and the whole human race was 'imputed,' or put to Christs' account. And because God imputed our sin to Christ, He suffered our penalty, which was death. All our liabilities were transferred to Him....(and) Christ's righteousness was 'imputed' to us. His righteousness is credited to us, put to our account (Psalm 32:8; Romans 4:8). Justification pronounces the sinner legally innocent, freeing him from condemnation.\" (Conner 272) \n \n Romans chapters 3-4 contain the magnificent statements of justification for those who place their faith in Jesus Christ. Romans 3:21-22 states:\n \n \"But now a righteousness from God, apart from (observing) the\n law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets\n testify. This righteousness from God comes through faith in\n Jesus Christ to all who believe.\"\n \n A few sentences later, Paul declares, \"For we maintain that a man is justified (righteous in the eyes of God) by faith apart from observing the law.\" (Romans 3:28)\n \n In Systematic Theology, Wayne Grudem makes the point that, \"the word 'justify' in the Bible indicates that justification is a legal declaration by God. Paul says, \"Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies; who is to condemn?\" (Romans 8:33-34). Grudem continues, \"In God's legal declaration of justification, He specifically declares that we are just in His sight. This (legal) declaration involves two aspects. First, it means that we have no penalty to pay for sin, including past, present, and future sins. The second part of justification is that God must declare us not to be merely natural in His sight but actually to be righteous in His sight. In fact, He must declare us to have the merits of perfect righteousness before Him.\" (Grudem 724-25)\n \n When considering the implications of legal declarations, we have to acknowledge that there is a substantial body of judicial law which was given to us by God. I'm speaking, of course, not only of the Ten Commandments, which comprises the moral law, but also the civil, dietary, and ceremonial laws of the Old Testament. This 'weighty' and seemingly inflexible array of commandments can surely be viewed as a burdensome yoke of oppression for humanity. In Old and even New Testament times, man considered his salvation as being inexorably linked to his 'keeping' of the law. To the degree that he kept the Lord's rules and regulations, that was the degree to which he calculated his chances of salvation. Yet the keeping of the law was and is an exercise in futility. In Galatians 3:10-11, Paul addresses this contentious issue:\n \n \"All who rely on observing the law (as a means of achieving salvation or righteousness) \n are under a curse, for it is written: 'Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do every-\n thing written in the Book of the Law.' Clearly, no one is justified\n before God by the law, because, 'The righteous will live by\n faith.\" \n \n The law was powerless to justify anyone righteous in the eyes of God for the simple reason that no mortal human was able to keep the law.\n \n \"There is no one righteous, not even one...no one who seeks God.\n There is no one who does good, not even one.\" (Romans 3:10-11)\n \n \"I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he\n is obligated to obey the whole law.\" (Galatians 5:3)\n \n One might sweat out an entire lifetime trying to keep only one of God's laws, much less all of them. No, keeping the law was not the way to justification. The law had four major purposes:\n \n 1. It shows us the moral character of God\n 2. It serves as a tutor to lead us to Christ, by defining what sin is.\n 3. It is a guide for Christian living.\n 4. Knowing the law can keep us from suffering the adverse consequences of sin.\n \n SELF- JUSTIFICATION IN SCRIPTURE\n \n It seems clear from scripture that there are only two possible sources of obtaining justification: from one's own self, or from an outside source. Mark chapter 10 gives us an illustration of one man's attempt to justify himself before God (before Jesus). A rich young man is asking Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life. In verse 18 Jesus responded by stating, \"Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.\" Jesus goes on to list a number of the Ten Commandments as the standard by which the young man must measure his actions. The young man remarked, \"Teacher, all these I have kept since I was a boy.\" To which Jesus then said, \"One thing you lack. God, sell everything you have and give it to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\" The story ends when the young man's face fell and he went away sad, because he had great wealth. \n \n There are a number of lessons in this story. One of these was that the young man was trying to justify himself before Jesus by indicating he was \"keeping the law,\" when in reality he was in violation of the commandment not to make for one's self any idols. Money was the young man's idol, and thus he had already broken the law. Perhaps some other young man might have listened to Jesus reciting the commandments and come to realize that not only could he not keep them in the future, but he had already broken many of them in the past. The conversation might well have then taken a different turn. He might have said something like, \"Teacher, I confess that I have not kept the whole law, and I guess I need to be truthful and tell you that I don't think I can keep it in the future either. What then can I do?\" I'm fairly sure that Jesus would have told him to believe in Him, and then he will receive eternal life. One other note: later in the story of the rich young man Jesus noted that, \"It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\" When the disciples asked, \"Who then can be saved?\" Jesus responded by saying, \"With man this is impossible, but not with God. With God, all things are possible\" (v. 27). The crux of the message was that it is impossible for a rich man to justify himself, especially when he is engaging in idol worship. Though man might possess great wealth, and achieve tremendous influence in the worldly system, he still has two major problems: one, he still is unable to keep the law; and two, he is completely helpless in justifying himself before God - he needs divine assistance. Only God can justify a person righteous. And it's not by the works of man that this is achieved, but by God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9).\n \n Two other examples of men seeking to justify themselves before God can be found in Luke 16:15 and 18:11. It is from these types of Biblical references that the Bible paints an exceedingly clear picture that man, of himself, has no means of self-justification. Only God is able to perform that work.  \n \n PAUL AND JAMES - Are they in agreement with each other?\n \n Much has been said over the years about salvation, justification, and works, and their relationship to each other. I think it is best to look at this from a chronological perspective, starting with the words of the apostle Paul in Ephesians 2:8-9:\n \n \"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this\n not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that\n no one can boast.\"\n \n Paul makes the following points:\n \n 1. You are saved by (God's) grace through faith (in Jesus Christ).\n 2. This salvation did not originate from yourselves.\n 3. It is the gift of God (therefore it cannot be earned).\n 4. This salvation is not by any type of works that a man can perform.\n \n \n Back in Romans chapter 4, Paul gave an illustration from Genesis 15:6 concerning Abraham's justification:\n \n \n \"If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something\n to boast about - but not before God. What does the scripture\n say? 'Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as\n righteousness.\" (Romans 4:2-3)\n \n Now, going forward to James chapter 2 we read:\n \n \"What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but\n has no deeds (works)? Can such faith save him? Faith, by\n itself, if it is not accompanied by action (works - KJV), is dead.\n You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds\n is useless? Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous\n for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? You\n see, a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone.\"\n \n James is clearly referring to Genesis chapter 22 as the point where Abraham was justified righteous. What we see here is an illustration that James uses to answer those people who are claiming to have saving faith but no works. Specifically, he states, \"Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to him, 'Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed,' but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? (what good is that man's faith?)\" In effect, James is saying, \"You claim to have faith? You claim that God has saved you, put His Holy Spirit in you, and sealed you for redemption? You claim all these things and yet you let the poor go without food or clothes? What kind of a faith is that? I, James, will tell you quite frankly that if you possess the kind of saving faith that results in regeneration and changes a person's life, the Holy Spirit will do a work in you and cause you to follow the Lord's decrees (Ezekiel 36:27) and feed and clothe the poor.\" \n \n Well, what then does Paul state about works as proof that a person's life is changed? Perhaps not surprisingly, he agrees with James:\n \n \"I preached that they should repent and turn to God and prove\n their repentance by their deeds.\" (Acts 26:20)\n \n So why did Paul state in Ephesians that a person is saved by grace through faith, and not by works? And why did he refer to Genesis 15:6 as the point of Abraham's justification and not Genesis 22? Initial saving faith is the precursor to works. Abraham was not saved (justified righteous) by performing works, he was performing works because he first was saved and regenerated by faith. Works are the result of our regeneration and salvation, not the cause of it. Faith by grace is the antecedent of works. It chronologically occurs first. Once the Holy Spirit indwells a believer at the point of salvation, He starts the process of progressive sanctification (see Ezekiel 36:25-27), and one of the effects of the indwelling Spirit is that of causing, or compelling a person, by a change of heart and mind, to perform works of a Godly nature. James' argument addresses that time period of a person's life, following true salvation and regeneration, when good works are supposed to be in evidence. He is saying, \"Now that you claim to be saved, we should be seeing some good works out of you. However, if these good works are not apparent, then your initial faith was probably not genuine, and you were never, either in the eyes of God, nor in the eyes of man, justified righteous.\" \n \n Another way to illustrate this is to consider the thief on the cross next to Jesus - the one who stated, \"Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.\" Then Jesus responded by saying, \"I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise\" (Luke 23:42-43). It was at this particular moment that the repentant thief received his salvation, and was justified righteous in the eyes of God. This particular moment would also coincide with Genesis 15:6, when Abraham believed God and it was credited (imputed to his account) as righteousness, and would also coincide with what Paul stated in Ephesians 2:8-9. Note that there is no evidence that the thief had performed any good works in his life. To the contrary, his works were more of a criminal nature than a Godly nature. That was the very reason he was being crucified. Even as he initially hung from his cross, he heaped insults on the Lord (Mark 15:32). But then the sky darkened, his pain and suffering magnified, and the words Jesus spoke on the cross hit their appointed target, and the thief had a change of heart and believed on the Lord. At that point, the thief received his salvation and justification. \n \n Now, if by some means the thief could have come down from the cross, prior to death, and continued on with his life, then eventually his saving faith would have produced good works (corresponding to Abraham in Genesis 22 and James chapter 2). There is a progression whereby salvation leads to good works. In the eyes of God, Abraham was genuinely justified righteous in Genesis 15:6. Because his faith was genuine, it produced his works in Genesis 22, whereby he was seen as being justified righteous in the eyes of men. James and Paul, though they approach the issue of justification from two different points in time and two different perspectives (the perspective of God and the perspective of man), nevertheless are in total agreement with each other.",

   "Pappillion -\n \n I'd like to see you read this because it's how believers are justified / declared righteous in Christ. It's extremely important.\n \n JUSTIFICATION\n \n Justification: \"1: the act, process, or state of being justified by God; 2. the act or an instance of justifying.\" (Webster 628)\n \n Justification: \"To justify or make just, by which sanctification is included under justification; to set right; correct a wrong thing done; to deem right or approve. Justification is, in Pauline language, synonymous with reconciliation. God is not imputing to men their trespasses, but declaring them righteous. The means (of justification) is the vicarious expiatory death of Jesus Christ. The sole condition is faith ... in Jesus Christ.\" (Hastings 510)\n \n Justification: \"To prove or show to be just; to vindicate as right; to declare free from guilt or blame; to absolve, to clear; to pardon or clear from guilt; to acquit; declare righteous; pronounce sentence of acceptance.\" (Conner 269) Conner goes on to quote J.R. Gregory (\"The Theological Student\"), who defines justification as, 'That act of God by which He accepts as righteous the penitent sinner who believes on Christ for salvation.\"\n \n With the above definitions and quotes as our starting point, we can now delve into one of the most dynamic and unselfish works in the history of creation - the work of Jesus Christ, who became our righteousness because we had none of our own. Author Kevin Conner explains it this way:\n \n \"When Adam sinned, all that he was and all that he did was 'imputed' to the whole, unborn human race. Sin left a debit on the books (Genesis 3:1-16; 2:17; Romans 5:12; 6:23). In Adam all sinned, and all died, spiritually and physically (I Corinthians 15:22). When Christ died on Calvary, the sin of Adam and the whole human race was 'imputed,' or put to Christs' account. And because God imputed our sin to Christ, He suffered our penalty, which was death. All our liabilities were transferred to Him....(and) Christ's righteousness was 'imputed' to us. His righteousness is credited to us, put to our account (Psalm 32:8; Romans 4:8). Justification pronounces the sinner legally innocent, freeing him from condemnation.\" (Conner 272).........\n \n\n \n The fatal flaws here are that Jesus cannot be in heaven if he has taken upon himself all sin or the belief that sin cannot enter Heaven is wrong.\n \n If the penalty of sin is death, physical and spiritual, and Jesus took upon himself the penalty for our sins then he cannot be alive physically or spiritually or he did not take away all our sins or the doctrine of sin is flawed.\n \n What is the point of allowing man to fall, punish him for it so that later God can appear to sacrifice himself leaving us in the same place physically and potentially spiritually?\n \n How does believing that Jesus is God merit salvation that nothing else will?

What does 'rebuilt' mean? It means with the Third temple intact.\"\n \n J?lem posters call for 3rd Temple\n \n (note: The \"Temple Mount Faithful\" have already hewn out the cornerstone\n \n The Temple Mount Faithful Presents the Cornerstone for the Temple Mount on Jerusalem Day)\n \n Prophecy will soon be fulfilled again.",

   "Nothing in the Bible supports that assertion and you know it. sexual immorality =/= homosexuality. \n\n \n Illicit gay sex is a sin in the Bible and you SHOULD know it if you don't already. And Jude 7 confirms sexual immorality and perversion in Sodom and Gomorrah.\n \n Pro-Gay Argument #1:\n \n Sodom was destroyed because of the inhospitality of its citizens, not because of homosexuality. \n \n Professor John Boswell, in Christianity, Social Tolerance and Homosexuality (University of Chicago Press 1980), supports this view, basing it on two assumptions: first, that Lot was violating Sodom's custom by entertaining guests without the permission of the city's elders,[75] thus prompting the demand to bring the men out \"so we may know them\"; second, that the word \"to know\" did not necessarily have a sexual connotation.\n \n The Hebrew word yada appears 943 times in the Old Testament; it carries a sexual meaning perhaps 10 of those 943 times. The argument, then, is that the men of Sodom had no sexual intentions towards Lot's visitors.\n \n Response: \n \n The argument makes no sense in light of Lot's responses. His first response, \"Don't do this wicked thing,\" could hardly apply to a simple request to \"get to know\" his guests. His second response is especially telling: he answered their demands by offering his two virgin daughters- another senseless gesture if the men wanted only a social knowledge of his guests. And why, if these men had innocent intentions, was the city destroyed for inhospitality? Whose rudeness was being judged-Lots', or Sodom's citizens? \n \n The theory raises more questions than it answers. While Boswell and Bailey are correct in pointing out the seriousness of inhospitality in Biblical times, inhospitality alone cannot account for the severity of Lot's response to the men, or for the judgment that soon followed.\n \n Pro-Gay Argument #2:\n \n Sodom was destroyed for attempted rape, not homosexuality.\n \n This argument is more common; it is proposed by lesbian author Virginia Mollenkott and others, and is far more plausible than the \"inhospitality\" theory.\n \n \"Violence-forcing sexual activity upon another- is the real point of this story,\" Mollenkott explains.[76] Accordingly, homosexuality had nothing to do with Sodom's destruction; had the attempted rape been heterosexual in nature, judgment would have fallen just the same. Violence, not homosexuality, was being punished when Sodom fell.\n \n Response: \n \n The argument is partially true; the men of Sodom certainly were proposing rape. But for such an event to include \"all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-both young and old,\" homosexuality must have been commonly practiced. Mollenkott makes a persuasive case for the event being much like a prison rape, or the kind of assaults conquering armies would commit against vanquished enemies,[77] but her argument is weakened by Professor Thomas Schmidt's cited evidence in early literature connecting Sodom with more general homosexual practices:\n \n Responding to Pro-Gay Theology",

   "Let it not be said the grace of God for salvation in Jesus Christ is not freely available. Today, and until the day you die, God's grace and salvation for eternal life in heaven are available to you. Here's how to receive your salvation:\n \n 1. Understand that God LOVES you and offers a wonderful PLAN for your life. \n \n \"For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life\" (John 3:16 NIV). \n \n 2. Man is SINFUL and SEPARATED from God. Therefore, he cannot know and experience God's love and plan for his life. \n \n \"All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\" (Romans 3:23). \n \n 3. Jesus Christ is God's ONLY provision for man's sin. Through Him you can know and experience God's love and plan for your life. \n \n He Died in Our Place - \"God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us\" (Romans 5:8). \n \n He Rose From the Dead - \"Christ died for our sins...He was buried...He was raised on the third day, according to the Scriptures...He appeared to Peter, then to the twelve. After that He appeared to more than five hundred...\" (1 Corinthians 15:3-6).\n \n He Is the Only Way to God - \"Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but through Me'\" (John 14:6). \n \n 4. We must individually RECEIVE Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord; then we can know and experience God's love and plan for our lives. \n \n We Must Receive Christ - \"As many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even to those who believe in His name\" (John 1:12). \n \n We Receive Christ Through Faith - \"By grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, that no one should boast\" (Ephesians 2:8,9). \n \n When We Receive Christ, We Experience a New Birth - Read John 3:1-8) \n \n We Receive Christ by Personal Invitation - [Christ speaking] \"Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any one hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him\" (Revelation 3:20). \n \n God Loves The World\n \n The Apostle Paul wrote: If you confess with your mouth, \"Jesus is Lord,\" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. As the Scripture says, \"Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame.\" - Romans 10:9-11\n \n Repent of your sins, and then don't forget to forgive others (very important):\n \n \"For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.\" - Matthew 6:14-15\n \n Finally, a sample prayer for salvation:\n \n Dear Lord, \n \n I admit that I am a sinner. I have done many things that don't please you. I have lived my life for myself. I am sorry and I repent. I ask you to forgive me. I believe that you died on the cross for me, to save me. You did what I could not do for myself. I come to you now and ask you to take control of my life, I give it to you. Help me to live every day in a way that pleases you. I love you, Lord, and I thank you that I will spend all eternity with you.\n \n In Jesus name I pray, Amen.\n \n A Prayer for Salvation\n \n Thereafter, always remember 1 John 1:9 - If we confess our sins, he (God) is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.",

   "God relates Jesus' future mission to the Gentiles: \n \n \"It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will give you as a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.\" (Isaiah 49:5,6) \n \n Jesus fulfills Isaiah's prophecy concerning his revelation to the Gentiles of Galilee: \n \n Matthew 4:13 Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali-- 14 to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah: 15 \"Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way to the sea, along the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles-- 16 the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.\" \n \n Jesus preaches to large crowds of Gentiles and heals many: \n \n Matthew 5:23 Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. 24 News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed, and he healed them. 25 Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and the region across the Jordan followed him. \n \n Jesus heals the Gentile Centurion's servant:\n \n As he entered Capernaum, a centurion came forward to him, beseeching him and saying, \"Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, in terrible distress.\" And he said to him, \"I will come and heal him.\" But the centurion answered him, \"Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this,' and he does it.\" When Jesus heard him, he marveled, and said to those who followed him, \"Truly, I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.\" (Matthew 8:5-10) \n \n Jesus heals a deaf Gentile: \n \n Mark 7:31 Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis. 32 There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man. 33 After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue. 34 He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, \"Ephphatha!\" (which means, \"Be opened!\"). 35 At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly. \n \n Jesus witnesses to the Greeks: \n \n John 12:20 Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast. 21T hey came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. \"Sir,\" they said, \"we would like to see Jesus.\" 22 Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus. 23 Jesus replied, \"The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. 24 I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. 25 The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. 26 Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me.... 34 The crowd spoke up, \"We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever, so how can you say, `The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this `Son of Man'?\" 35 Then Jesus told them, \"You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. The man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going. 36 Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light.\"\n \n Jesus visits Samaria and teaches there: \n \n John 4:39 Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, \"He told me everything I ever did.\" 40 So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. 41 And because of his words many more became believers. \n \n Jesus commands his disciples to take his Gospel to all nations: \n \n Matthew 28:19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. \n \n Elsewhere, Jesus heals the Gentile Woman's daughter (Matthew 15), appoints Paul as a witness to the Gentiles (Acts 9:15), and suffers on the Cross of Calvary for the sins of all men (Jew and Gentile alike).",

Ez you need to read this stuff, it might help with some of that Delusion you have.\n \n God is Imaginary - 50 simple proofs \n \n \n If Jesus is God, then why didn't Jesus use his omniscience and omnipotence to actually do something magnificent and beautiful on earth rather than squandering his \"power\" as he does in the Bible? \n \n Think about all the problems that Jesus could have solved. At the very least, Jesus could have transcribed passages into the Bible that would have ended sexism, racism and slavery forever.\n \n As the simplest example, think of all of the suffering that slavery has caused. Millions upon millions of people have suffered through the bondage and the remarkable brutality of slavery because Jesus and his Bible fully support it. If Jesus had simply made a clear statement -- \"Slavery is forbidden, free all the slaves\" -- he could have prevented all of that suffering. Yet Jesus did nothing of the sort. Instead, Jesus endorsed slavery.\n \n In the same way, Jesus could have chosen women to be six of his apostles and made several speeches on the topic of women's equality. By doing that, he would have put a huge dent in sexism. Because Jesus did not do that, we still see the effects of Jesus' sexism in our society today.\n \n At a larger level, if Jesus were God, he could have performed so many real miracles. He could have, for example, eliminated smallpox and a host of other diseases that science is busy eliminating today. Jesus could have given the people of Israel the knowledge that they would need to start a technological society and raise themselves above the primitive living conditions of the day. Jesus could have taught the Israelites about metallurgy, chemistry, biology, physics, manufacturing, mathematics, medicine, engineering, etc., etc., etc. He could have also taught them how to responsibly use these technologies to solve the problems of pollution and habitat destruction that so often accompany them today.\n \n Jesus could have made clear statements to deter nuclear proliferation.\n \n The argument could be made that Jesus did try to solve poverty when he said that you should sell everything you own and give it to the poor. However, in saying this, Jesus showed a complete misunderstanding of human nature. Do you know of anyone who has sold all their possessions and given the money to the poor? As a result, half the people on planet earth today live in abject poverty, supporting themselves on less than $3 per day. Instead, Jesus could have taught mankind to effectively share wealth so that the immense problem of global poverty that we see today would have been solved long ago. Jesus could have also laid down a template for governance that would have ended monarchies, dictatorial regimes and warlords forever.\n \n Most importantly, Jesus could have made his message so clear, and the proof of his godliness so obvious, that all six billion people on the planet would have aligned with him, rather than fragmenting into dozens of bizarre and often warring religions. By doing this, Jesus could have completely prevented the Crusades and 9/11, among many other things.\n \n Jesus, if he actually were God, could have done so much. He could have prevented massive amounts of human suffering with his words and deeds. Instead, he did none of this. To any rational person, these problems make it painfully obvious that Jesus was a normal human being. The fact that Jesus was a normal human being renders the entire New Testament of the Bible meaningless, and in the process shows us that the God of the Bible is completely imaginary.",

   "http://www.philosophy-religion.org/handouts/homophobia.htm (among many other sources)\nWASHINGTON -- Psychoanalytic theory holds that homophobia -- the fear, anxiety, anger, discomfort and aversion that some ostensibly heterosexual people hold for gay individuals -- is the result of repressed homosexual urges that the person is either unaware of or denies. A study appearing in the August 1996 issue of the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, published by the American Psychological Association (APA), provides new empirical evidence that is consistent with that theory.\n \n Researchers at the University of Georgia conducted an experiment involving 35 homophobic men and 29 non-homophobic men as measured by the Index of Homophobia scale. All the participants selected for the study described themselves as exclusively heterosexual both in terms of sexual arousal and experience.\n \n Each participant was exposed to sexually explicit erotic stimuli consisting of heterosexual, male homosexual and lesbian videotapes (but not necessarily in that order). Their degree of sexual arousal was measured by penile plethysmography, which precisely measures and records male tumescence.\n \n Men in both groups were aroused by about the same degree by the video depicting heterosexual sexual behavior and by the video showing two women engaged in sexual behavior. The only significant difference in degree of arousal between the two groups occurred when they viewed the video depicting male homosexual sex: 'The homophobic men showed a significant increase in penile circumference to the male homosexual video, but the control [non-homophobic] men did not.'\n \n Broken down further, the measurements showed that while 66% of the non-homophobic group showed no significant tumescence while watching the male homosexual video, only 20% of the homophobic men showed little or no evidence of arousal. Similarly, while 24% of the non-homophobic men showed definite tumescence while watching the homosexual video, 54% of the homophobic men did.\n \n When asked to give their own subjective assessment of the degree to which they were aroused by watching each of the three videos, men in both groups gave answers that tracked fairly closely with the results of the objective physiological measurement, with one exception: the homophobic men significantly underestimated their degree of arousal by the male homosexual video.\n \n Do these findings mean, then, that homophobia in men is a reaction to repressed homosexual urges, as psychoanalysis theorizes?\n \n While their findings are consistent with that theory, the authors note that there is another, competing theoretical explanation: anxiety. According to this theory, viewing the male homosexual videotape may have caused negative emotions (such as anxiety) in the homophobic men, but not in the non-homophobic men. As the authors note, 'anxiety has been shown to enhance arousal and erection,' and so it is also possible that 'a response to homosexual stimuli [in these men] is a function of the threat condition rather than sexual arousal per se. These competing notions can and should be evaluated by future research.'\n \n Article: 'Is Homophobia Associated With Homosexual Arousal?' by Henry E. Adams, Ph.D., Lester W.

Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - \"Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\"\n \n 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - &#8220;But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine&#8230;&#8221;\n \n Jude 7 &#8211; &#8220;In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.&#8221; \n \n There's no gay marriages in the Old Testament; No gay marriages in the New Testament; no gay sex approved anywhere in the Bible. Just the opposite - gay sex is condemned in both testaments. God is consistent on that.\n \n And to close:\n \n &#8220;Whosoever shall be guilty of Rape, Polygamy, or Sodomy with man or woman shall be punished, if a man, by castration, if a woman, by cutting thro' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least.&#8221; - Thomas Jefferson - A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments\n \n Come out of Sodom. Come out of Gomorrah. Flee from the coming wrath.",

God NEEDED to START OVER, why would a perfect omnipotent God need to redo something? He would have done it right the first time wouldn't you agree? Probably not since it isn't possible for you to be wrong because you are spiritually enlightened. Then why do you keep getting these things wrong?\n \n \n \nGen 6:4 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown.\n\n \n They being fallen Angels is not the only theory, who exactly they were is unclear they might be Angels, they might be the sons of Seth or they might be another group, yet you know. To bad all those people who have been looking at this stuff their whole life don't have the spirit to provide the answers to them. By the way I don't recall them being mentioned as coming on the Ark, but I guess it wasn't necessary to name them although how they managed to procreate again must have been very different kind of marriage back then. The mighty men who were of old, men of renown. Doesn't really convey a sense of fallen or rebellious people does it? Why is that?\n \n \n \nGen 6:5 Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.\n\n \n \n Why does this disappoint God? Wasn't this part of the plan? You know an appearance earlier may have prevented all that wickedness. I know keeping Satan away from the kids or at least watching over them would have saved a lot of people a lot of grief, especially Jesus.\n As for what the Nephilim were? Look it up and learn something for yourself. \n \n \n \n \nOh well, good luck with that.

Is that why you are so bitter? I mean you just make up whatever comes to mind or blindly accept the first thing that sounds ridiculous enough to work, but not enough to be just a complete fabrication.\n \n I mean seriously why do so many who have the spirit fail to agree on so few things. Sure they mostly have the basics down but there is no excuse for that many differences. Although I am sure you will think of something.\n \n \nHe didn't say that what He would do was unbelievable, He said that you wouldn't believe the works He will accomplish in the last days, see? \n\n \n Isn't that because he did things that were unbelievable?

But you wont and can't hear us because you are deaf, blind and spiritually dead to Gods truths.

I refuse to accept the man made version of him that you have. I refuse to accept that God finds the idea of his creation living a life thinking they are worthless and undeserving. That they are so broken that they cannot ever be self sufficient and are such a disappointment that they must beg Jesus to convince God to pity us because even though we know we didn't earn heaven we want it anyway and this is they way we think is best. \n \n That is what I will not hear nor attribute to God. And before you say it there is no man is better than God in what I said. Think of your kids, if you have them or if you did what would be your desire for them? Confident (not egotistical or narcissistic) self sufficient leading meaningful lives or thinking they can only be so much and will most likely never achieve even that living off the generosity of others?

We philosophers know that question as the \"Problem of Evil\": Given that God is all-powerful, it would seem he could eliminate evil; given that God is perfectly good, it would seem he should want to eliminate evil; why then is there evil?\n \n Traditional answers appeal to free will, but that only explains the moral dimension of the problem (sin), not the natural dimension of the problem (suffering). But of course, free will raises a whole host of problems of its own, as I'll address momentarily in a post to Easyrider.\n \n In any event, Job is certainly trying to address the question. But the best \"answer\" it comes up with is, \"Trust me, there's an answer, I'm just not going to give it to you, as you couldn't understand it anyway.\" Blind trust, acceptance of ignorance, outright infantilization -- Job is a fascinating text, filled with imagery and irony, but it's completely dissatisfying as a solution to the problem it discusses.\n \n And the utter insolubility of the problem in theological terms is exactly why I became an atheist.

And because his foreknowledge is perfect, he can't be wrong.\n \n Hence, God already knows what you're going to do, and there is no possibility -- none whatsoever -- that you will do otherwise. So how can there be \"free will\" in any meaningful sense?\n \n Indeed, since God already knows whether any individual will be granted grace and accept it, he even already knows who'll be saved and who'll be damned. Which raises another interesting question in its own right: Why go through the trouble of creating the world in the first place, when the outcome is in no doubt at all? What's the point?\n \n Personally, I say, so much the worse for theism at this point. It's not atheists who've robbed life and the world of meaning.

It is just some nonsensical words strung together for Christians to absolve their concept of God from the woe and misery in the world.\n\n \n Agreed. Here's Nietzsche's take on it. It's one of my favorite passages in his body of work, and even in all of philosophy. As insightful -- and scathing -- as anything gets. And the last line is a brilliant gem.\n \n All italics in the passage below are found in Nietzsche's original. I've bolded that final sentence, because frankly, it just rocks.\n \n -----\n \n Error of free will. -- Today we have no sympathy anymore for the concept of \"free will\": we know only too well what it is -- the most disreputable of all the theologians' tricks, designed to make humanity \"responsible\" in the theologians sense, that is, to make it dependent on them... Here I am simply offering the psychology of all making-responsible. -- Wherever responsibilities are sought, what tends to be doing the seeking is the instinct of wanting to punish and rule. One has stripped becoming of its innocence when some state of being-such-and-such is traced back to will, to intentions, to acts: the doctrine of the will was essentially invented for purposes of punishment, that is, for purposes of wanting to find people guilty. All the old psychology, the psychology of will, is predicated on the fact that its originators, the priests in the elites of ancient communities, wanted to create a right for themselves to inflict punishments -- or wanted to create a right for God to do so... Human beings were thought to be \"free\" so that they could be ruled, so that they could be punished -- so that they could become guilty: consequently, every action had to be thought of as willed, the origin of every action had to be thought to lie in consciousness (and thus the most fundamental act of counterfeiting in psychologicis was itself made into the principle of psychology...). Today, when we have started in the opposite direction, when we immoralists are trying with all our strength to get the concepts of guilt and punishment back out of the world, and to purge psychology, history, nature, social institutions, and sanctions of these concepts, there is in our eyes no opposition more radical than that of the theologians, who, with the concept of the \"moral order of the world,\" go on infecting the innocence of becoming with \"punishment\" and \"guilt.\" Christianity is a metaphysics of the hangman...\n \n -- Friedrich Nietzsche, Twilight of the Idols",

You can't say God gives salvation to those who do x but eternal punishment for those that do y and think free will exists. God uses salvation or damnation to influence behavior, that is not free. Choosing action contrary to what God wants doesn't remove or negate any influence a person has been subjected to. \n \n As a Christian you have only two choices in everything you do. Would God approve and therefore you do or he won't and therefore you don't. Sometimes your wants differ from God's, what keeps you from doing what you want is God's influence that tells you no.

You don't want to be mindless robot, eh? 'Course not. But don't blame God for all the evil in the world when you know one (evil) can't exist without the other (freedom).\n\n \n You're missing the point, in at least three ways.\n \n 1. Rejection of the traditional notion of \"free will\" is not equivalent to denying \"freedom\" as such. The former -- in its traditional terms -- is a metaphysical idea that is largely incoherent in the eyes of many. But freedom can simply be conceived in terms of acting without external control. One can accept that freedom is good without affirming that traditional \"free will\" makes a lick of sense.\n \n 2. Atheists are perfectly happy to attribute moral evils to human beings and their choices. There is a second aspect to the Problem of Evil, and that's natural evil: suffering caused by non-human events, like diseases or natural disasters. These atheists attribute to non-human mechanisms. Both sorts of evil admit of natural causes, so that's what atheists appeal to. There is no explanatory problem for them.\n \n 3. Theists, however, do have an explanatory problem. The entire difficulty arises if and only if all this moral and natural evil -- all this sin and suffering -- is believed to be governed by an ostensibly omnipotent and benevolent deity. If one denies that there is such a deity in the first place, as atheists obviously do, then the problem disappears. But if one believes in such a deity, then why that deity would allow such evils is a major problem. Why does he put up with it? Why are these evils parts of his perfectly good plan?...\n \n Or to put it another way: Atheists dont' blame God for the world's evils, because we don't believe in God in the first place. The question is, given what theists believe about God in relation to the world, why shouldn't they?...",

Zorba, EZ, youre the resident religious nutters on this forum, answer me!!\n\n \n It's really kind of obvious for anyone with an ounce of common sense. Adam and Eve was placed in a Garden Paradise where all of their physical needs were met. They were as innocent and guileless as lambs but they possessed the gift of free will. In order for them to appreciate that choice of self determination, God placed the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the center of the garden as the one fruit they must not eat because knowledge of evil would infect their souls and separate them from God through spiritual death.\n \n I mean, of what value would free will be to Man if God had placed us in a completely antiseptic world where no option to disobey Him existed on any level at all? But with the tree of knowledge of good and evil, not only did a very real choice of obedience exist, but it was a choice with immediate consequences if they disobeyed Him, That being spiritual death. \n \n The fact is that the deceiver and tempter who lied to them believed that by getting them to eat of the fruit they would physically die and he would defeat this creation of Man who God made in His own image in its infancy, But God had different plans and the death He warned them of turned out to be a spiritual death resulting in all of Adam and Eves descendants being born with the fallen, or sinful natures which resulted in them eating of that Tree in the center of the Garden.\n \n That is the beauty of what Jesus did on the Cross as He undid what occurred in the Garden as the unblemished Lamb of God. A truly acceptable sacrifice who was worthy to die for the sins of Man once and for all time, forever nullifying the need of repeated animal sacrifices which the Jews had instituted so long ago as followers of the living God. That is why it is written:\n Rom 5:12 Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned-\n Rom 5:13 for [fn] until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law.\n Rom 5:14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam, who is a [fn] type of Him who was to come.\n Rom 5:15 But [fn] the free gift is not like the transgression. For if by the transgression of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many.\n Rom 5:16 The gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned; for on the one hand the judgment arose from one transgression [fn] resulting in condemnation, but on the other hand the free gift arose from many transgressions [fn] resulting in justification.\n Rom 5:17 For if by the transgression of the one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.\n Rom 5:18 So then as through one transgression [fn] there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one act of righteousness [fn] there resulted justification of life to all men.\n Rom 5:19 For as through the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous.\n Rom 5:20 [fn] The Law came in so that the transgression would increase; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,\n Rom 5:21 so that, as sin reigned in death, even so grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n As for you labeling me and EZ as religious nutters?

   "God ordained salvation in Christ before the world was created (Revelation 13:8). Here's God's plan as I laid it out some years ago:\n\n \n Years and this is what you end up with? Not time well spent.\n \n \n1. Man was to be created in the likeness and image of God (Genesis 1:26).\n\n \n Man is created in the likeness of God, there is no was to be.\n \n \n2. Part of this \"likeness\" was a knowledge of good and evil (Genesis 3:22 - And the LORD God said, \"The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil.)\n\n \n Really then what is the point of the punishment? We got what we came for or we really aren't like God are we.\n \n \n3. For Adam to be truly \"like\" God, he had to acquire a knowledge of good and evil.\n \n 4. The means to that end was eating of the tree of the knowledge of good \n and evil.\n\n \n God can make a brain, a nervous system and cognition all from plain old dirt, but knowledge of Good and Evil can only come from eating a fruit. This makes sense as reasonable for an omnipotent being that desires the best for us.\n \n \n \n5. To do that a \"tempter\" was likely needed to entice Adam into sin.\n\n \n Because without him Adam would not sin. He was already made like God and was perfect and innocent.\n \n \n6. God provided, or allowed, Satan as the tempter.\n\n \n Satan was doing the good work of God, which was necessary and vital to God and was in the best interest of man.\n \n God caused evil to enter the world, had he not acted so there would be no evil in the world. He purposefully and intentionally caused evil to come into the world. What would have happened if Adam had said no to Eve?\n \n \n7. God knew in advance what the outcome would be, but allowed it anyway.\n\n \n Why not say here eat this? \n \n So in the beginning man was more pure than God and it wasn't until God conspired with Satan that man fell from his position at the top. No allow implies he could have stopped it, but was not the cause. God was the cause, it was his plan to subject man to evil and let him fall to a place in which he could never recover the innocence and purity God did not want him to have.\n \n \n8. God knew atonement would be required, and ordained Jesus Christ as the\n \"Lamb slain from the foundation of the earth\" (Revelation 13:8).\n \n\n \n Shortly after declaring laws such as not to murder, drink blood, make graven images of the things in heaven, eat human flesh and that a third person can not atone for another persons sins among others he then sends a third person to atone for everybody else's sins by having his chosen people murder his son who now is draped over the neck and displayed in every christian and their houses of God where the remember this act by eating and drinking a representation of his flesh and drinking his blood. I would also add that despite this forgiveness we have been granted nothing is changed and there is no expectation for anything to change until God decides it is time to kill everybody who doesn't worship and adore him for all the things he has done while never being seen or heard the last 2000 years. This is especially true for the people who he did not choose to speak with and covenant with who have managed to break almost every law he gave to his chosen people. \n \n \n9. Man achieves the likeness of God, acquires a knowledge of and overcomes\n evil, partakes of Christ (the \"tree of life\"), and is reunited in paradise with \n God. Man, like God, is now an overcomer.\n\n \n Could there be a more inefficient less effective waste of time than this plan? How does the concept of a life of punishment and hardship for all generations fit into this. Why didn't Jesus just say don't do it when Satan and Eve were picking fruit to eat. Plucked it right off sweet baby Jesus and he never said a word.\n \n \n \nThe key to all this remains, \"Is acquiring a knowledge of good and evil a prerequisite to coming into the likeness and image of God? If the answer is yes, I think Adam has to eat from that tree, and God has to make it happen. \n\n \n So you admit you may be wrong and none of this was necessary. Could he not just ask if Adam wanted some?\n \n \nIf the answer is no, then I think you have to look back to Genesis 3:22 and reconcile that with Genesis 1:26, explaining how Adam is \"like\" God, but at the same time lacks a knowledge of good and evil. Also, how does man acquire that knowledge without eating of the fruit of that tree? \n\n \n If there is no evil what is the purpose of bringing it into the world if there is no good either? Again we were actually better than God, but he fixed that for us. \n \n How about God causes us to already know or can God not do that?\n \n \nGod's plan is awesome.\n\n \n How would you know, you have not the least bit of an idea what it may entail",

No one is obliged to show it's not a relationship or that it is anything else.\n\n \n But good enough for whom? If you honestly believe that you are in a relationship with a transcendent and supernatural deity, I have no problem with that whatsoever.\n \n I don't agree with it, of course. Muslims can claim a relationship with Allah, Hindus with any number of their deities, Shintoists with long-deceased ancestors. I'm sure that's good enough for them, too. And I have no problem with that, either.\n \n But I do have a big problem with any religious believer demanding that people who don't believe they have the same kind of relationship, or even any such relationship at all, behave as if they had it. And I have an even bigger problem when such demanding believers further demand that those who don't share their faith accept laws based upon it.\n \n This, quite frankly, is what I see \"conservative Christianity\" doing in America.\n \n \nBy always demanding proof over something for which proof is no obligation, you're making an issue out of something that is not one.\n\n \n It's not an obligation, until the point at which it is demanded that everyone must follow the rules of that for which no proof has hitherto been offered. Once it is demanded that everyone accept laws derived from such a religious view -- that the nation's abortion laws be modelled on the conservative Christian view of abortion, or her marriage laws reflect conservative Christian views of marriage and sexuality -- then there is absolutely an obligation to prove the point.\n \n \nAnd of course, no amount of proof would suffice anyway for you, so it's moot anyway.

If the relationship was a personal one that was prominent in the individuals life and minimally spilled over everything would be fine. For many people of faith this is actually the way it is, but a large minority believe there must be conformity to what they believe. When this happens people want to know why what is being promoted as necessary or for their best interest is so. This is where the desire to have claims validated stems from. When that minority, which is large enough to have a political voice, speaks to come as close as it can to making society as they see it should be it goes against self interest to not oppose it. This group is not open to agreeing to disagree or comprise, their religion does not permit it and it happens not as a preferred choice.\n \n The aspect of a relationship is difficult as it cannot be shown to be real. The believer just has a feeling or a sense that is attributed to God, with no physical way to establish if it is true or not. It may be, but Christians are not open to that. That is questioning one's faith and is frowned upon in any religion. The anti-theist is actually open to religion, but not when it doesn't make sense and can't be proven in any way shape or form that does not require faith. For the most part they are a response that only recently has started to be proactive.",

   "A most revealing post, ARCHANGEL.\n \n You see, I came to the conclusion several months ago, that I could no longer in good conscience call myself a Christian. I still have a great deal of respect for Christianity and for religion more generally, when they are practiced by reasonable people with a sense of common human decency. But I decided it was no longer something I could do myself. It was an extremely difficult decision, on a number of levels, but I'm glad I made it.\n\n \n Thanks for confirming everything Archangel said about you in his many exchanges with you about your claims of being a believer in Christ. Apparently you think one can go from having a personal relationship with Christ to atheism through some process of reversed enlightenment. \n \n The fact is though, that the process only occurs in the opposite direction. People go from unbelievers to born again in every single salvation experience that takes place while true born again believers never turn away from the God who's Holy Spirit indwells them. So you have just confirmed that all of your repeated claims of having been a true christian was nothing more than posing as a believer while possessing none of the attributes of true salvation.\n \n That's why you accepted evolution, abortion and every other secular humanist philosophy that's out there in opposition to the believers.\n \n \nAs I have not identified myself as anything other than an atheist since my recent return, long after your \"first\" posts, I find it interesting that you felt it necessary to go through the little charade below.\n \n You saw through nothing then, and see through nothing now: I really was a Christian at the time, but am a Christian no longer.\n\n \n Stop lying to yourself Matthew, and then to us. If you were ever a true christian you would understand what having a personal relationship with God means and that nobody walks away from Him after possessing His Holy Spirit which you obviously never possessed. So you may have been a self declared christian poser but you were never a believer which is the distinction archangel clarified with you in every debate. \n \n \nI'm going to spare us both further headaches and just put you on ignore.\n\n \n Thank you very much.",

You think just because someone has turned to atheism they have never experienced religion ?.. Like Matthew I was at one time a Born again Christian.. For over 10 years I lived the life of religion, did all the things a good little christian is supposed to do, and I didn't suddenly just turn Atheist overnight. My beliefs now come from many years of reading, using \" Rational\" thought, and the FACT that my eyes were simply opened to the truth , and that truth is that GOD is not real . You Christians have your belief, I have no problem with you believing in Fiction. My problem is when you try to force your beliefs on others. You Judge others who choose not to believe and you believe that you are somehow in a higher place simply because you put all your faith in a God. That is Arrogant. \n You are the ones who need to wake up. God don't exist, Never has, never will. Prayer doesn't work, there is no heaven or hell, when you die you are dead, get over it. \n \n Yes I was \" Saved\". But I realize now that I am awake to reality that it was all just a big brainwash thrust upon me by the people in my community, my Family and peers who were simply brainwashed themselves in the same way. \n \n Easy way to prove your GOD don't exist is to simply take a close look at the World around you. If the GOD in the Bible truly existed this world would be a much better place to live in. So at the least , if there is a GOD, then he is a Miserable failure. An ALL POWERFUL, ALL KNOWING , JUST, LOVING , GOD, Would never allow the things that go on around us every day. You can preach till the Cows come home. You can go on forever praying and believing in the invisible Man. But one thing you or anyone else on this planet CANNOT do is PROVE that he is real. Saying it and believing it doesn't make it true. and there's approximately 4 billion other Humans on this planet who agree with that...",

The problem is that you demand unreasonable evidence that people generally don't demand for other things. You demand anything associated with religion hold to a higher standard of proof, IMO out of a subconscious prejudice.\n\n \n The standard of proof isn't any higher at all. What does God look like? What does his voice sound like? And what sorts of inferences should any observer be able to make about him, based on nothing more than logic? Don't just talk about a subjective belief: provide some objective evidence, verifiable by the investigations of other subjects.\n \n The problem that I have with God, in evidentiary terms, is exactly the same problem that I have with all transcendent metaphysics, from Plato to Hegel: none of it is even in principle empirical to begin with -- and that means the metaphysician in question can say whatever logically consistent stuff he wants, but without conferring a scrap of knowledge in the process. It's essentially the critical position first elaborated by Immanuel Kant.\n \n For what it's worth, Kant was not an atheist. He just didn't think that transcendent metaphysical claims could be proved, including claims about the existence of God. He thought God's existence was a matter of faith. He even thought that beliefs held on faith could be rational, in the sense that they could certainly be consistent with knowledge imparted through empirical means, so long as faith was not held to trump that empirically derived knowledge. Guess what? I completely agree on all counts! But unlike Kant, I'm just not willing to make the leap of faith, because I see no reason to.\n \n \nThe really funny thing is that there is actually outlandish stuff that people will say in scientific circles (quantum physics, dark matter, etc.) that hasn't been viewed either, and you'd more readily believe in it. It's pretty hard to take you seriously when you demand an \"appearance\", frankly, because no doubt you don't apply that standard in other areas.\n\n \n But they're not the same sorts of claims or inferences. Claims about quantum physics and dark matter and the like remain empirical and material (i.e., natural) claims, derivable from other claims of exactly the same sort. The closest that theology comes to this is the argument for design, but while that argument starts with natural evidence, it ends by shifting to a supernatural conclusion, a metaphysical claim that goes far beyond what empirical evidence can justify. A completely different type of argument to begin with.\n \n \nBut regardless, if you don't want to believe in God, then don't believe in God. Let the chips fall where they may and don't worry about it.\n\n \n And as I've already said, I just wish more conservative Christians' policy positions reflected a commitment to exactly this attitude. Unfortunately, while they might say \"go ahead and believe what you want about religion,\" they advocate policies that reflect only their religions. Even if I disagree with them about when life begins, or when a being acquires a soul, they demand that I accept their view of such matters when it comes to abortion law. Even if I disagree with them about the morality of homosexuality, or the sacramental status of marriage, they demand that I accept their view of such matters when it comes to civil marriage law.\n \n In short, I simply don't believe conservatives when they advise lightening up about this stuff.\n \n \nI'll bank on there being a God, and if there isn't, I've lost nothing. Pascal's wager. Careful though, he was an adherent of reason AND faith.\n\n \n Pascal's Wager, indeed -- or, as many of my own Christian philosophy students quickly realize without any prompting at all: the reduction of religious belief to petty self-interest.

   "Are there only Three Horsemen in the Revelation of John the Divine?\n \n Revelation 9:17-18 (King James Version)\n 17And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone. \n 18By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.\n \n Verse 9:18 begins with \"By these three\". This obviously does not fit in with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalyse as proposed in Chapter 6 of the Revelation. Why did the editors of the New King James Version add the word \"plagues\" after \"By these three\"? Did they want to hide the inconsistencies in the extant Revelation? The editors of the New King James Version even italicized their added word \"plagues\"! However, \"By these three plagues\" is an obvious non sequitur.\n \n Revelation 9:18 (New King James Version)\n 18 By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed-by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which came out of their mouths.\n \n It is clear that the (Three) Horsemen of the Apocalypse caused the fire, smoke and brimstone. Verse 9:18 has nothing to do with plagues. Since when do plagues have mouths? It doesn't make any sense!\n \n There are many Theologians who interpret the White Horse as Jesus Christ. The suggestion according to A.S. is that Jesus Christ was indeed revealed in the First Seal but was not on a horse. The Three Horsemen of the Apocalyspe would therefore consist of the Three Horsemen revealed in the Second, Third and Fourth Seal.\n \n Many will say that this is not enough evidence to question the validity of the extant Revelation. To these people I suggest to also take a look at verses 22:18-19. \n \n Revelation 22:18-19 (King James Version)\n 18For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:\n 19And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.\n \n According to A.S.: These verses contain a curse upon those who would dare to make any changes to the book! These two verses contain the threat of dark arts, which is pure sorcery. This contradicts many of the warnings against sorcery and all forms of dark arts that appear throughout the Bible. These two verses, in and of themselves, should have alerted any thinking theologian that something is very wrong with the extant version of the Revelation.\n \n Incidentally, in the case that verses 22:18-19 are indeed the word of god as revealed to his servant John the Divine, then the editors of the New King James Version as well as many other bible editors are in deep trouble, as they added the word \"plagues\" to the Revelation. Ironically, this would add plagues unto them according to verse 22:19.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Is this part of the Original Revelation?\n \n \"And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder. And I saw, and behold Jesus, majestically radiant, and clothed in white raiment and he had a sword; and a warrior's protective helmet was given unto him.\n \n And he opened the second seal. And there went out a rider in brown raiment on a horse that was light chestnut brown: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.\n \n And when he opened the third seal I beheld, and lo another rider in black raiment on a black horse; and he that sat on him held in his hand a black lantern that shineth not.\n \n And he opened the fourth seal. And I looked, and behold a rider in silvery-grey raiment upon a grey horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.\n \n And three of the riders had with them huge armies. The army led by the rider on the brown horse was exceedingly strong and fresh. The rider on the black horse fell to the ground, as if dead. Then cometh the rider in the silvery-grey raiment to lift up the black rider. The black rider and his army mingled with the silvery-grey army led by the rider in silvery-grey raiment. Together, they fought against the rider in brown raiment and its army. The army of the silvery-grey rider and the army led by the rider in black raiment were determined yet tired. As the brown, black and silvery-grey armies engaged in battle, Jesus calmly watched on.\"",

   "Deist Roots of America\nIt is between fifty and sixty years since I read it [the Book of Revelation], and I then considered it merely the ravings of a maniac, no more worthy nor capable of explanation than the incoherencies of our own nightly dreams ... I cannot so far respect them as to consider them as an allegorical narrative of events, past or subsequent. There is not enough coherence in them to countenance any suite of rational ideas.... And pardon me if I say, with the candor of friendship, that I think your time too valuable, and your understanding of too high an order, to be wasted on these paralogisms. You will perceive, I hope, also that I do not consider them as revelations of the supreme being, whom I would not so far blaspheme as to impute to him a pretension of revelation, couched at the same time in terms which, he would know, were never to be understood by those to whom they were addressed.\n -- Thomas Jefferson, letter to General Alexander Smyth, January 17, 1825\n",

IF* you die and there is no heaven to go to, would you have wasted your life?\n \n *IF is a keyword that denotes a query. i could have said \"if you died and went to heaven...\" and that would also not be an assumption, because im questioning there being a heaven. however, if i had asked that question, i get the feeling you would not respond the same way. here, let me ask my original question and a new question and id like to see how you respond.\n \n if you died and there was no heaven to go to, would you have wasted your life?\n \n if i died and went to hell, would i have wasted my life?\n \n if you dont answer the second question with the same response as you answered the first, then it is YOU who is assuming - youre assuming there is a heaven and a hell, but ill ask again - and please respond to this too - \"excuse me, were you there?\"",
