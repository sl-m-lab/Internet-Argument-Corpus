   "I yank it on a daily basis. I yank it when it is politically conveinent... even as a filibuster tactic when needed. Although I am a conservative, I yank it to issues that dont usually agree with that stance. When yanking it I usually recite the Preamble to the constitution... replacing the important words with \"yank\"...such as \"We the yankers of the United States, in order to form a more perfect yank...\" You get the idea.\n \n Election day (Which I call Yanking Day) is a big day... I am the first on line in my town to Yank it.. I usually dress up in a suit so it counts more. I love it when there are people outside the building as I walk in, trying to talk me into yanking it to their candidate.. I tell them \"My mind is made up... I know who I am yanking it for!\" I then go in, close the curtain...and...thats right... I vote.\n \n There... That'll yank 'em...",
