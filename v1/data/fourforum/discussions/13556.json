   "This is either a lie, or it's an admission of spamming. That is: either you posted the 'facts' with context and implications in mind, or they aren't relevant (as no facts are, without context) and shouldn't have been posted in the first place.\n \n However, if you want to go down that route: my response was pointing out the simple fact that no conclusions could be drawn from your 'facts'. Nothing else.\n\n \n No criminal shootings until after the defensive guns were banned. Why?\n \n \nIn both of these cases you're speaking as if there can be no uncertainty about this issue. The clear fact that many places are doing just fine without a written Constitution, along with the fact that there are a great many who disagree with your view in several different ways (see this poll for an example) implies that you should be arguing your case, rather than stating it as if it were already an agreed issue.\n\n \n Just fine by who's definition, yours?\n \n Without a constitution to restrict the reach of the government, you're not doing fine, nor are you safe from government interference.\n \n \nSince when was I a politician? I'm the one currently explaining my standards for quality of life.\n\n \n Your standards aren't shared by everyone else. Therefore your standards shouldn't be seen as a measuring stick.\n \n \nAlthough come to that, I'd be interested to see if you can support your claim that politicians regularly break laws that apply to 'everyone else'.\n\n \n How about everyone in the Obama administration that hasn't paid their taxes?\n \n \nWell, given that it's been a significant amount of time since the UK last had a Constitution, and we still have lawyers on every case, I'd say it would be really quite a long time. Given also the US' recent track record springing out of it's War on Terror, I wouldn't say you're on the most stable ground here...\n\n \n We at least have a groundwork for stability. The UK on the other hand, has no groundwork. The fact that you still have lawyers is irrelevant as that standard could easily be wiped out if your government decides that it's prudent, and you'd have no legal recourse.\n \n \nI'm never sure how the belief that a piece of paper protects you from tyranny actually works. Either a government is not tyrannical, in which case you have nothing to worry about, or it is - in which case what prevents them from overturning the Constitution just like any other law?\n\n \n They don't have the power to overturn the Constitution. Doing such would require an amendment by amendment approach, requiring a two thirds vote for each overturning. There's no way something like that could be kept under wraps, and the backfire from voters would be overwhelming.\n \n \nI'm a person with three reasons why you shouldn't, none of which you have commented on.\n\n \n The history of nations disagrees with you.\n \n \nHey, you brought up the ad hom, use it how you will. I shall simply comment.\n\n \n Whatever.\n \n \nSo... you feel that the sale of a type of gun could not have been banned if people didn't need permits in the first place?\n You seem to be confusing correlation and causation again.\n\n \n It's all a matter of how it started, how government gained the authority to do such. And they did it one piece at a time.\n \n \nYour claimed difference between the two is simply your point of view. As I've said above, that doesn't make it a fact, nor does it mean I should be sharing that POV.\n\n \n Well let's look at the facts of the matter.\n \n When it comes to things like cars, registration of the vehicle, as well as acquiring a driver's license, aren't requirements for actually owning the car.

What you view as catholicesque is actually the wisdom of our FF. Wasn't it Jefferson who said the best government is the one that governs least? From the buffoons passing laws I don't believe they are thinking of consequences.\nThe FF were men, just like the rest of us. Empire-founding, but still men. Attempting to decide the laws of a country by fitting different interpretations onto the writings of dead men sounds definitely Catholic-esque to me.\n \n As for 'one mans improvement...' - when I say 'with quality of life in mind', I mean 'quality of life for the population as a whole'. I've written that elsewhere, but should have included it in my earlier posts too; my bad.\n \n My argument has always been that gun control would bring more improvements than poison - although some poison would be inevitable.\n \n \nSome how I don't think following the mechanism to change the constitution is unconstitutional. \nNor do I. However, there are those with different opinions...\n \n \nNo criminal shootings until after the defensive guns were banned. Why?\nAnd now we get the context/implications - so much for 'stating the facts, nothing more'.\n \n As I said above (initially), you are confusing correlation with causation. The idea of a school shooting didn't become vogue until after it had been done for the first time - I doubt that many of those who commit school shootings are worried about whether they will be shot at or not, especially if they plan on committing suicide at the end of it. Schools are simply chosen because that is the place where they spend most of their time - just like people who bring guns to their workplace for a spree.\n \n As a counter-fact, the UK hasn't had any school shootings since defensive guns were banned; the ban being put in place after (and largely due to) a school shooting. There's some rationale there that's actually applicable - the law put in place to stop a school shooting seems to have done it's job.\n \n \nJust fine by who's definition, yours?\n \n Without a constitution to restrict the reach of the government, you're not doing fine, nor are you safe from government interference.\nI don't have any definition to use but my own...\n \n I don't lack any more rights than you do that I would miss. I have no desire to own a gun; and I wouldn't be able to take one to my work in any case, even if I were in the US.\n By what standards would you measure 'just fine'? Avoiding tautologies, if you can.\n \n \nYour standards aren't shared by everyone else. Therefore your standards shouldn't be seen as a measuring stick.\nSee above - I'd rather use my standards than anyone else's to make a sweeping generalisation from (as laws must do). You are just as guilty of this - your standards are no more universal than mine.\n \n Ideally, each person could choose to live by their own standards. However, that leaves no room for laws. I doubt you'd want a country entirely without law...\n \n \nHow about everyone in the Obama administration that hasn't paid their taxes?\nThere isn't a lot of point in this, seeing as they get paid directly from taxes - and set the amount at which they are paid.\n \n \nWe at least have a groundwork for stability. The UK on the other hand, has no groundwork. The fact that you still have lawyers is irrelevant as that standard could easily be wiped out if your government decides that it's prudent, and you'd have no legal recourse.\n \n ...\n \n They don't have the power to overturn the Constitution. Doing such would require an amendment by amendment approach, requiring a two thirds vote for each overturning. There's no way something like that could be kept under wraps, and the backfire from voters would be overwhelming.\n\n Tryannical government, remember? They don't have to obey the laws. The Hand of God isn't going to come and slap them on the wrists if they do something unConstitutional - they might get voter fallout, but that's assuming a tyrannical government cares about votes and plans to have an election ever again.\n \n Furthermore, the UK government faces exactly the same problems - but there isn't this 'constitutional' rider on top of everything else. Laws are judged on their own merit, not on how Constitutional they are. Voter backlash is still a major issue, as the last set of MEP elections showed.\n \n \nThe history of nations disagrees with you.\n ...\n It's all a matter of how it started, how government gained the authority to do such. And they did it one piece at a time.\n\n Well, that's an argument against my first point - showing that A always leads to B. You still have two points remaining to deal with.\n \n Furthermore, it's hardly proof against that first point. Gun control has not always expanded ever outwards - the history of the US shows that, with the laws of various states continuously rising and falling.\n \n \nWell let's look at the facts of the matter.\n \n When it comes to things like cars, registration of the vehicle, as well as acquiring a driver's license, aren't requirements for actually owning the car. You don't even have to register a car for use on private property, only on public streets and highways.\nSo you wouldn't object to a law that didn't prohibit gun ownership, but did prohibit unregistered gun use in a public place?\n \n Congratulations, you are now pro-CCW licences.",

   "This has very good incite, and this is ONLY a teaser. Something that the Clinton Administration did and is very worth the read.\n \n   Preventing School Shootings -- A Summary of a U.S. Secret Service Safe School Initiative Report \n There is no one reason why school shootings occur, and no one type of student who becomes a shooter. This article dispels the myths and stereotypes about school shooters. \n \n Children who attack can be any age and from any ethnic group, race, or family situation. Contrary to assumptions that some of our youth \"just snap\"-they don't. They plan.\n \n The National Institute of Justice has joined forces with the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S. Department of Education to assess ways to prevent school shootings. The Secret Service has a long tradition of protecting our Nation's leaders by identifying, assessing, and managing persons who might pose a threat of targeted violence Targeted violence is a term developed by the Secret Service to refer to any incident of violence where a known (or knowable) attacker selects a particular target prior to the act of violence. Because of the Secret Service's expertise in the study and prevention of targeted violence, the Secretary of Education asked the agency to conduct a similar operational study of school shootings. \n \n The findings clearly emphasize the importance of paying attention and listening to America's young people. More than a handful of adults, parents, teachers, school administrators and counselors, coaches, and law enforcement-can make an important contribution to and play a key role in preventing violence on school grounds. Young people who need help often do not keep it a secret. They may exhibit obvious warning signs either through behavior or remarks, such as voicing problems or grievances, complaining about persecution or bullying, or showing signs of depression or desperation. \n",

Something's not quite right there, and if you ignore one of the possible solutions you may never fix it.\n \n There is a fair amount of evidence that gun control is effective as crime control. However, it's only in small-scale situations. On a country-wide scale, there are simply too many factors to link correlation and causation, as I've been saying - and this works for both sides of the argument.\n \n \nI don't think you can make that claim. Other forces are at work. Look at all of the gun control in these places. It didn't prevent any of these. Possibly \"you are confusing correlation with causation.\"\n\n Firstly, that correlation != causation was my point. The UK fact was just supporting evidence that NATO's claimed causation was not accurate.\n \n Secondly, I had a look at your link. There are 58 shootings on that list, and you had to delete 43 of them in order to 'copy' a list that was made up entirely of non-US shootings (you also deleted a few extra, by the looks of it). That gives almost 75% of all the school shootings on the list which are in the US, compared with the rest of the world. If you want to imply anything from that list, it won't be in your favour.\n \n \nThis has very good incite, and this is ONLY a teaser. Something that the Clinton Administration did and is very worth the read.\n\n You are entirely correct. I had a look for a better version rather than the google cached one; the link is here. My notable findings:\n \n 1. The report opened with mention of a shooting that took place in 1974 (I suspect it refers to this one). That made me question NATO's initial assertion that 'there were no school shootings prior to 1990': a quick google gives me this incredibly relevant list.\n Looks like your initial 'fact' was actually a lie, NATO. Any comment?\n \n 2. There is a section (starting on page 4 on the pdf, or page 13 in the journal) entitled \"Attackers had easy access to guns\". Some quotes:\n Most attackers had used guns previously and had access to guns. In nearly two-thirds of the incidents, the attackers obtained the gun(s) used in the attack from their own home or that of a relative.\n ...\n A threat assessment inquiry should include investigation of weapon access\n ...\n The large number of attackers who acquired their guns from home highlights the need to consider issues of safe gun storage.\n \n \nAccording to this, you guys have either been doing something right or you have been extremely lucky! I wish I knew which. Maybe it is something social that we could copy, but it is clear, that the firearms are still available.\n\n Firearms are indeed still available. That's never going to change; you can never wipe out a market entirely. However, it is reducing. From the article:\n \"The figures contrast with those nationally, where gun crime is still falling in known hotspots. On Merseyside, gun crime is down by 27%; nationally, firearms offences have fallen by 5%.\"\n \n \nBull hockey! You digress from absurdity into abject insanity. There is no doubt what our FF meant nor what the executive, courts, and Congress jobs are and their powers and duties are enumerated in Articles I, II, and III.\n\n Unfortunately, there are a great many issues where the Constitution is unclear; for example, on abortion issues, or gay rights issues. Even on gun issues; if it was clear-cut, there would have been a unanimous decision on the Heller ruling.\n \n \nYou don't understand that a right doesn't have registration in many States. One of those is Texas and as far as I know there are no \"registered guns\" in the whole, entire State. Wanna try again? A public place belongs to the people not to any branch of government.\n ...\n Nope, not necessary. Murdoch vs. Pennsylvania, amoung other cases, ruled that it is unconstitutional to require a license tax or fee to exercise a Constitutional right.\nYou look like you need some context for my quote.\n \n NATO claimed that the actual difference between car registration and gun registration (other than the 'its a right' thing, which I had just given an argument against) was that you only needed a licence to actually use a car, not to own one. My response was that if that were the case, he shouldn't be complaining about CCW licences.\n \n By showing that you still do object to CCW licences, all you are doing is underlining my point. The only actual difference between cars and guns is that guns were around to be protected when the FF wrote their paperwork - as such, they are considered a 'right'.\n \n \nYou really have no concept of the power of the Supreme Law of the Land do you? You think politicians can change it in which case I would refer you to Article the VIth. You understand you are trying to impose your foreign will on a Republic don't you?

However, it isn't 'the' fundamental document for UK law; there are none. As my handy link states; \"no official constitution was ever written down, because the political system evolved over time, rather than being changed suddenly in an event such as a revolution.\".

No, we don't have to bend the interpretation of law. Heller wasn't the first case touching on the 2A.

It's a sliding scale.\n \n As for Heller, my point was not that it was unique, but that it was not unanimous - thus proving that there is no definitive 'interpretation' of the constitution.\n \n \nYour country has greater freedom to \"set laws\"; and you deem that a good thing? Ours are bound by the Constitution. Government here was always supposed to be weak and the less of it the better. You do understand that 50 States also have Constitutions too don't you?\nI certainly deem that a good thing. It gives the government the power to respond in a flexible manner to whatever long-term challenges may arise.

Which would you rather do - never travel in a car again, or never touch a gun again?\n \n Cars are more lethal than guns - but they improve quality of life exponentially more than guns do.\n \n EDIT: OldSarge posted. Reply is on it's way...\n \n \nNow in most circles that would be known as a strawman. The murder rate is not caused by a broken constitution otherwise you'd have proof of it. You need to find what causes a high murder rate. Is it a joke of a criminal justice system? The break down of morals and family? The constitution is working just fine in spite of evidence free claims to the contrary.\n\n I wouldn't describe it as a straw man; I'd describe it as supporting evidence. It was certainly neither an attempt to divert attention from the main topic nor a false representation of your argument, which are the two definitions of a 'straw man'.\n \n With regards to the bold; this simply isn't true. There are plenty of things that exist despite the fact that no proof of them has been found - scientific discovery is based on this principle. Furthermore, it's irrelevant, as I hope to be about to show.\n My argument is that there is something wrong with the US murder rate - something which I think we both agree on. As we have both stated in previous posts, there are lots of potential causes for this. However, the difference between us is that you refuse to admit that one possible cause for the high rate is the US' lack of gun control. It's not proof that 'its broke', but it is evidence that it might be. There is also evidence that 'fixing it' may well reduce homicide rates - a further implication that because it can be fixed, it may well be broke.\n \n \nMore strawman here? Gun control sure works in gun free zones. We saw the proof of that in the muslim terrorist attack. Gun control sure worked for the late mayor of Hiroshima gunned down in a gun controllers wet dream of an island nation. The rising fate of gun crime in another island nation is sure proof. It sure worked in gun ban Washington DC while across the river in Arlington VA the murder rate was ooops lower.\n\n Again, not a strawman - except for possibly on your part. I have never said that gun control is 100% effective - in fact, I have repeatedly said the opposite - so listing shootings in 'gun free zones' does not affect my argument, because you have no way of knowing how much worse (or better) it would have been with different laws. Comparing DC and Arlington is also flawed - DC has always had higher homicide rates, so the fact that it still did when gun control was about does not make it the fault of gun control. Furthermore, there is evidence directly linked to this situation which favours my side, not yours: link.

   "An ad hominem argument ... is an argument which links the validity of a premise to a characteristic or belief of a person advocating the premise. ~Wikipedia\n\n \n Which is entirely accurate in it's portrayal of your position. Stomp you little feet and keep demanding that we do away with our Constitution and accept muther England's where the Queen is still the figurehead and her control is awesome.\n \n \nFor example, implying that because I live under a 'totalitarian government', I must 'dislike the freedoms you have' and that this is further evidence for the fact that I neither 'know, understand, or have read the Constitution' (paraphrased).\n\n \n It is apparent you have NOT! You continue to prove that...\n \n \nIt's not what you told me, it's the evidence you presented in order to support this claim. A claim which I reject, in case you didn't notice - as the only other bit of evidence you supplied (that 'I think politicians can legally change the Constitution on their own') was a lie.\n\n \n Look subject, you implied it could be changed and should be changed because \"old guys wrote it and we don't know what it means.\" There is your lie!\n \n \nIt's still here. However, it isn't 'the' fundamental document for UK law; there are none. As my handy link states; \"no official constitution was ever written down, because the political system evolved over time, rather than being changed suddenly in an event such as a revolution.\". And the 'UK constitution' can continue to evolve over time, with far greater ease than the US'.\n\n \n Yep, you have no idea where it is, what it says, or where it will wind up. Your law will probably be written finally by a foreign invader. Don't call us, we will be busy.\n \n \n \nNo, all laws are set at some point between totalitarianism (total legal control) and anarchy (zero legal control). It's a sliding scale.\n\n \n Ours aren't, plain and simple but it is still possible to get a tyrant that would attempt to change our Constitution and our FF wisely saw the benefit of every man being armed.\n \n \nAs for Heller, my point was not that it was unique, but that it was not unanimous - thus proving that there is no definitive 'interpretation' of the constitution.\n\n \n It is unanimous in that it IS AN INDIVIDUAL RIGHT. 9-0.\n \n \nI certainly deem that a good thing. It gives the government the power to respond in a flexible manner to whatever long-term challenges may arise. Even the US has it's own short-term version of flexibility - but requires a re-writing of The Constitution before anything else can change.\n\n \n uh huh, and that is what the Posse Commitatus Act is all about, to prevent such occurances.

Which would you rather do - never travel in a car again, or never touch a gun again?\n\n \n Which is merely taxed to pay for the roads.

The cities share a border with each other, divided by a river. If gun control worked to any significant extant then the two would have similar murder rates at the very least. One would expect that at the very least the DC side would be lower. Gee your source claims 47 deaths were prevented. No wait it suggests they were prevented. Now what in the world does suggest mean?

There is a section (starting on page 4 on the pdf, or page 13 in the journal) entitled \"Attackers had easy access to guns\". Some quotes:\n Most attackers had used guns previously and had access to guns. In nearly two-thirds of the incidents, the attackers obtained the gun(s) used in the attack from their own home or that of a relative.\n ...\n A threat assessment inquiry should include investigation of weapon access\n ...\n The large number of attackers who acquired their guns from home highlights the need to consider issues of safe gun storage.\n\n But I pointed out this!

London gun crime rises as shootings nearly double -- Teenage boys with cheap guns involved in 'respect shootings' to blame for increase, say experts\nShooting incidents in London have almost doubled compared with the same period last year, prompting grave concerns that gun crime in some areas is out of control.\n\n Just like the list of school shootings that I Listed of countries with school shootings with VERY SERIOUS GUN CONTROL!

The fact it was written a long while ago and is still open to interpretation doesn't mean that it could or should be changed, in and of itself - it's simply a criticism of the constitutional system as a whole. \n We both know it can be changed (after a process), and I believe it should be changed because I see it as doing more harm than good.

(Please note that my description should not be taken to imply a dichotomy of one-or-the-other; there is plenty of happy middle ground!)\n \n As for the importance of being able to keep guns 'just in case you want to rebel' - this argument conflicts heavily with another pro-gun favourite, that if guns were banned it would be a simple task to acquire them from the black market. Furthermore, I seriously doubt that an open rebellion would have any success, especially with today's military weapons. Also, if that was the case you should be complaining that you aren't allowed to carry your RPG around town just in case a quick insurrection is needed.\n \n \nIt is unanimous in that it IS AN INDIVIDUAL RIGHT. 9-0.\n\n Yes, but it wasn't unanimous overall.

The lower crime rate couldn't have anything to do with gun control could it?

   "Quite - despite the fact that cars are more widely used, more frequently used and benefit a populace more (I could probably do some maths for this, but really don't have the time right now).\n \n All this demonstrates is that the constitution is out of date.\n \n So you would prefer to have a car than a gun?\n \n You, like OldSarge, are avoiding the question. Which would you rather, cars or guns?\n\n \n I don't understand what your hangup is with the privilige of owning a car. It adds nothing to your claim our constitution is broken. Nor have you provided any evidence of same. Rather some off the wall medical study and claimed that as proof or pointing toward proof. Cars have nothing to do with your claim. It was pointed out that cars kill more people than guns and now you are off on a car strawman. I am not avoiding your question just ignoring it as it has nothing to do with a broken constitution. Which so far you are failing miserably in proving. I'd point out that a crime problem has nothing to do with a constitution and civil rights but it would go right on past. So focus on your claim please. So far you have demonstrated nothing other than conclusions and leaps of faith on your part. Do show where our constitution is broken or admit defeat and go onto other pursuits. My preference is in self defense via firearms. A car is not necessary in my life as I have mass transit, taxicabs and delivery service available. ",
