   "WEF Warns Of Pending US Slump\n \n by Stewart Douglas\n \n Story link: WEF Warns Of Pending US Slump\n \n The World Economic Forum has today announced that it envisaged a recession in the US over the next year, which could lead to problems for businesses stateside and further afield, and would require firms everywhere to reconsider their risk management strategies over the immediate short term.\n \n In its annual report entitled 'Global Risks 2008&#8242;, the Forum highlighted what it sees as a major threat to business activity in light of growing uncertainty over the health of the economy in the US following the sub-prime collapse and the problems derived from the spectacular crash of the summer months onwards.\n \n The situation in the US, according to the report, is likely to get worse before it starts to get better, as the growing impact of the credit crunch compounds housing market instability and the disaster of the banking industry at the moment, all of which has mounted to dent consumer cofidence and harm the overall economy.\n \n Ultimately it is predicted that the vicious circle of problems will lead to a US recession, which will give rise to problems for business across the world, all of which have been advised by the report to prepare for the impending storm likely to emerge from the US fallout.",

Not good for the dollar.\n Housing slump is expected to continue for 08. Mortgage crisis increases. The Dow's plumeting daily.\n \n \n Makes my black heart seep oil...which will be worth something as the cost of oil increases and demand exceeds production. $4 USD a gallon for gas this year...",
