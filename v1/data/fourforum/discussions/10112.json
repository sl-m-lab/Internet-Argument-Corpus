Is a little honesty from him, for once, too much to ask?\n \n Bowling for Columbine is a movie that should have been made, and should have been made better, really tried to answer the question of what motivated these kids to do what they did, instead we had a pointless gun-control debate in which Moore refuted his own points, and the inane conclusion that \"Americans are stupid and belligerent racists\", which doesn't really help anything or have anything to do with the most poignant part of the movie, the actual columbine incident.\n \n Farehnheit 9/11 was pointless and didn't address any controversial questions.\n \n I haven't seen sicko yet, but I'm not expecting any better from it or this latest creation.",

   "Yet another example of why I despise this guy, his recent CNN interview here:\n \n http://rawstory.com/news/2007/Michael_Moore_shames_CNN_Blitzer_on_0709.html\n \n He makes a good point about CNN's reporting, in fact he's absolutely right about their reporting being inaccurate, but this is marred by his habitual dishonesty, for example when he accuses the mainstream media of only rarely putting him on air, and then the host reveals Moore has in fact been invited on several times in the last few years, but turns them down.\n \n Why is it not possible for him to just stick to the facts AND have his rant about the mainstream media, he was going real well until he decided to just make some #### up to make his story sound better. And he never got around to addressing any of the factual points the intro made, for example about Cuba's ranking in the same system he uses to deride the standing of US health care, instead focusing on insulting the character of one of their journalists. So instead of having a point, and getting to it his way, his initial blowup looks more like a coverup, as if by being angry enough he can avoid dealing with the hard questions.\n \n Of course, he promises his website will get around to answering them, but if his history of doing this is any indication, he will answer perhaps one or two straight, misinterpret or sidestep answering others, and the harder ones won't be answered at all.",
