   "It is nice to hear insight from some one like that, who knows all sides of this issue.\n \n I think this stuck out from that article and explains a lot (especially with regards to \"global leadership\"):\n \n \nThe claim that oil was the motivation for the war on Iraq has been controversial. Do you think oil had anything to do with it?\n \n The US is importing 55-60% of its oil needs, and the percentage is expected to reach 70% in 10 years. That means the US needs oil for its own use and as an economic card.\n \n We should not forget that Europe does not follow the US as many think. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Europe is no longer in need of the US, and the US realises that.\n \n In the eastern hemisphere we have China whose GDP (gross domestic product) is expected to overtake America's in the future.\n \n Knowing that Europe and other big players are trying to book a place for themselves in tomorrow's world, the US is interested in disrupting oil flow to such huge competitive blocs.\n \n I think it is vital for any power to control the world's most important resource - oil.\n\n \n XXXXXXit, that explains everything. \n \n .",
