Just as gays should have the same rights as straights, shouldn't bachelors have the same rights as the married? The real solution to this is of course to roll back marriage as a legal institution altogether, which it should never have become, thus instantaneously fixing the whole controversy, but this is a herculean task, and the alternate ways forward up until that point are unclear to me.\n \n 2) A few of the more, shall we say \"militant\" gay rights advocates concern me, with apparent demands for the legal enforcement of equal treatment for gays in private business. I believe it is just as unjust to force those who have an aversion to homosexuality to \"tolerate\" it, in language, thought and action, as it is to enforce sodomy laws. The principle of \"freedom of association\" holds here, where two consenting adults should be able to do with each other whatever they want, the key word being \"consenting\". Homophobic business owners should not be required to hire gay staff, nor should gay business owners be required to hire homophobic staff. Neither should free speech be censored, and those fundamentalist Christians should be able to continue preaching about the \"sinfulness\" of anal sex, while gays should continue to be free to present their side of the story. I personally believe that in the long run, rational argument will win out over bigotry, and it's a sign of a weakness of an argument that it requires the government to prevent the opponent from opening his mouth.\n \n I trust, since the gay rights advocates on this board are on the whole quite intelligent, these comments will not be taken the wrong way.",

The real solution to this is of course to roll back marriage as a legal institution altogether, which it should never have become, thus instantaneously fixing the whole controversy, but this is a herculean task, and the alternate ways forward up until that point are unclear to me.\n\n \n Whether same-sex marriage is legalized or not, this possible inequality between single and married people exists. Legalizing same-sex marriage would grant equality between homosexuals and heterosexuals. Since this is the case, do you not agree that the best solution is to legalize same-sex marriage now, then consider removing marriage later? Certainly we can legalize same-sex marriage much sooner that we can remove marriage as a whole, and legalizing same-sex marriage would make it no more difficult to remove marriage as a whole if we decided to.\n \n I saw that you said that your view of the gay rights movement was less positive, but remember that neither side is advocating true equality, and the gay rights supporters are advocating more equality than their opponents.\n \n I should also say that I do not think we should remove marriage. It may help to understand marriage as a legal contract people can engage in. This contract allows two individuals to effectively add each other to their immediate families in the eyes of the law. Certainly it does not make sense to restrict the contract based on the gender of the people involved. But should we get rid of the contract alltogether because it only benefits two people and not single people? I don't think that's a good enough reason; marriage makes people's lives easier, and that makes it worth keeping. Single people should get all of the benefits that are possible for a single person. The benefits of legal marriage should be things specific to two people, like extended health care to your spouse's family members, property rights, etc. So in my opinion, any marriage benefit that a single person could want should be granted him without having to engage in marriage, but marriage should not be dissolved as a legal institution.\n \n \n2) A few of the more, shall we say \"militant\" gay rights advocates concern me, with apparent demands for the legal enforcement of equal treatment for gays in private business.

I personally believe that in the long run, rational argument will win out over bigotry, and it's a sign of a weakness of an argument that it requires the government to prevent the opponent from opening his mouth.\n\n \n I can see what you're saying about how people shouldn't be forced to hire gays. I think that would be a long and difficult debate to engage in, and I would currently suggest that the government should only intervene if so many companies are refusing to hire gay people that gay people are struggling to live in America. Perhaps if we're going to continue this discussion, we should start a new thread.\n \n I don't think anyone here is suggesting that free speech should be violated, but I could be wrong.",
