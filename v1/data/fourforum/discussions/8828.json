   "Grave news is that our soul is a breath of life from God's own body. As such, it is indestructible. Our soul is buried alive sealed inside our coffin. Our flesh is the only part of our corporeal that dies. Our soul has senses same as our flesh. It can sense pain and suffering or torment.\n \n The centripetal force of earth's gravity can pull our soul towards its magma chamber. Molten rock melts to lava temperatures that range from 700 to 1200 degrees centigrade. It is impossible for the heat to destroy our soul. Yet it can torment our soul for as long as it remains here on earth. The magma chamber is the Lake of fire.\n \n Christ, through the power of the Holy Ghost acts as a centrifugal force to resurrect us from the dead and lift us up into the Kingdom of Heaven.\n \n Soon, God our Father will call for each of us to come home. He will succumb us with a deep sleep as we're buried in our graves. It is vital that we do not tremble. Our Comforter will come into our coffin to comfort us as we await Christ.\n \n Listen for Jesus' voice. He will call to resurrect us from the dead. Those, who haven't received the baptism of the Holy Spirit may quiver. They may not hear him call out their names. \n \n May God have mercy on their souls.\n \n \nJohn5\n [25] Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.\n\n Hallelujah!",

Is a cheap and vicious threat of that nature going to make him suddenly appear Godly to those who don't believe? It makes him appear to be a lunatic with self esteem issues.\n \n \n \n \n \n That's your spin.

And please tell me what good comes of casting the hard hearted non believer into the pit? Would it not be wiser to find out why a person did not believe? Or better yet find out why people do believe. The fear factor and the greed factor. Your scared not to believe and you also want a reward for the servitude to your master. You are similar to a corporate \"yes man.\" The type that will agree to anything that comes out of the boss man's mouth. For all the painful tongue biting the \"yes man\" endures he never receives what he is actually longing for from the boss, which is \"respect\". For all you know the reward in the afterlife could be given to those who refuse to accept a God who didn't have the common decency to let himself be known to all of mankind throughout all time. Perhaps the countless and inaccurate translations, along with the additions and eliminations from the original texts produce have produced a holy book that God expects people to reject because he gave them a mind which they are expected to use. Tell me what is accomplished when everything you need to know is in the bible? There is nothing to figure out if you follow the book. So then why did God create mankind? Is he that desperate for something to occupy his time? Has there ever been a greater monster then this God you worship? Not in my humble opinion. When someone (God) decides to have billions of children over millions of years they either don't care or they aren't REALLY there. If you had a child that never saw you in person until they were just about to die would you expect that child to love, respect, and delight in the fact that you were his dad? I didn't think you would. But wait,,,,,,,,, you left a book with all the things he needs to do to spend eternity in the afterlife with you. You may see that as divine, but in this world you are considered a \"deadbeat dad.\" But how could you be anything but that, when the God you worship sets the same example?\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Otherwise heaven would resemble hell, with all the Christ-and-Christian bashers running amok.\n \n \n \n \n \n I would like to know how many times an atheist in a suit, either walking or bicycling while holding a book, has come up to you and said, \"Are you aware that there is no God?\" Before you have a chance to respond, he begins reading passages from his little leather bound \"atheist manifesto\" that offers you undeniable proof that God does not exist. It doesn't happen like that. But if it did then you would hear atheists whining about \"atheist bashing\". If you did not challenge, trivialize, and deny beliefs that do not line up with your own the Christian bashing would cease. The aggression that you do encounter is a defensive reaction to an offensive assault.",

I always thought it was a blended pagan/Christian holiday. emoticon_confused \n \n\n The true origins of Halloween lie with the ancient Celtic tribes who lived in Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Brittany. For the Celts, November 1 marked the beginning of a new year and the coming of winter. The night before the new year, they celebrated the festival of Samhain, Lord of the Dead. During this festival, Celts believed the souls of the dead-including ghosts, goblins and witches-returned to mingle with the living. In order to scare away the evil spirits, people would wear masks and light bonfires. \n \n When the Romans conquered the Celts, they added their own touches to the Samhain festival, such as making centerpieces out of apples and nuts for Pomona, the Roman goddess of the orchards. The Romans also bobbed for apples and drank cider-traditions which may sound familiar to you. But where does the Christian aspect of the holiday come into play? In 835, Pope Gregory IV moved the celebration for all the martyrs (later all saints) from May 13 to November 1. The night before became known as All Hallow's Even or \"holy evening.\" Eventually the name was shortened to the current Halloween. On November 2, the Church celebrates All Souls Day. \n \n http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Oct2001/Family.asp\n \n",
