   "It's not all that hard to understand, actually.\n \n Generally, things work out as intended. People pay for what they buy, people are left alone and so on. Law is obeyed, but it is never actually activated. Law thus only gets into focus when things go wrong.\n \n However, this means that people only get into contact with the law \"at a bad time\". Law and lawyers may not create problems, but are just called into action when problems arise, but this does not prevent the general public from associating the law and the lawyer with everything bad that happens in these circumstances.\n \n A side issue is that law is generally impartial, which means it is never actually completely on \"your\" side, and with common \"either with me or against me\" psychology, this results in the law being accused of taking \"their\" side.\n \n Of course, the fact that being a lawyer demands some serious education and that services of hghly educated people are generally quite expensive. Especially since everyone feels that justice should be free, especially to the one that is right, i.e. the one who is making the opinion.\n \n Next, we get to what that means in practice. Look at my post in the topic below for an explanation of why things are done as they are.\n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=201711#post201711",

The fact that a fledgling attorney has admitted that the mistrust exist and ask for \"views\" as to why it exist is all that I need submit. I don't think applying stats will sway anyone's opinion on my suspicion. Nor is it a vendetta for me. \n The only stat that I can offer anyway is my own distain for the craft and the seemingly acceptable practices that occur within it. \n The actions that many attorneys take in the name of justice for a client is disturbing. When an attorney becomes convinced of his client's guilt they should have an avenue of escape from representing that client. Without damage to their record or reputation. Lawyers work within a system created by \"lawyers\". Created \"in my opinion\" for the sake of monetary ends rather than justice for those who need it most. Victims.",
