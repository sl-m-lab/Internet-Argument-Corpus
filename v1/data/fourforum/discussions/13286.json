   "Here's an excerpt from the WSJ on Obama's speech\n \n\n Fact-Checking the President on Health Insurance \n His tales of abuse don't stand scrutiny.\n By SCOTT HARRINGTON\n ......\n To highlight abusive practices, Mr. Obama referred to an Illinois man who \"lost his coverage in the middle of chemotherapy because his insurer found he hadn't reported gallstones that he didn't even know about.\" The president continued: \"They delayed his treatment, and he died because of it.\" \n \n Although the president has used this example previously, his conclusion is contradicted by the transcript of a June 16 hearing on industry practices before the Subcommittee of Oversight and Investigation of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The deceased's sister testified that the insurer reinstated her brother's coverage following intervention by the Illinois Attorney General's Office. She testified that her brother received a prescribed stem-cell transplant within the desired three- to four-week \"window of opportunity\" from \"one of the most renowned doctors in the whole world on the specific routine,\" that the procedure \"was extremely successful,\" and that \"it extended his life nearly three and a half years.\"\n \n The president's second example was a Texas woman \"about to get a double mastectomy when her insurance company canceled her policy because she forgot to declare a case of acne.\" He said that \"By the time she had her insurance reinstated, her breast cancer more than doubled in size.\" \n \n The woman's testimony at the June 16 hearing confirms that her surgery was delayed several months. It also suggests that the dermatologist's chart may have described her skin condition as precancerous, that the insurer also took issue with an apparent failure to disclose an earlier problem with an irregular heartbeat, and that she knowingly underreported her weight on the application. \n These two cases are presumably among the most egregious identified by Congressional staffers' analysis of 116,000 pages of documents from three large health insurers, which identified a total of about 20,000 rescissions from millions of policies issued by the insurers over a five-year period. Company representatives testified that less than one half of one percent of policies were rescinded (less than 0.1% for one of the companies). \n Scott Harrington: Fact-Checking the President on Health Insurance - WSJ.com\n \n\n \n The man that claims that Republicans are using scare tactics and lies to derail socialized medicine should look in the mirror.",

   "Health insurance industry shill Scott Harrington, American Enterprise Institute for Public Research.\n \nThe American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research (AEI) is an extremely influential, pro-business, conservative think tank founded in 1943 by Lewis H. Brown. It promotes the advancement of free enterprise capitalism, and succeeds in placing its people in influential governmental positions. It is the center base for many neo-conservatives. \n\n American Enterprise Institute - SourceWatch\n \n For example, the Institute has been active in muddying the waters on the issue of global warming:\n \nCasting Doubt on Global Warming\n In February 2007, The Guardian (UK) reported that AEI was offering scientists and economists $10,000 each, \"to undermine a major climate change report\" from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). AEI asked for \"articles that emphasise the shortcomings\" of the IPCC report, which \"is widely regarded as the most comprehensive review yet of climate change science.\" AEI visiting scholar Kenneth Green made the $10,000 offer \"to scientists in Britain, the US and elsewhere,\" in a letter describing the IPCC as \"resistant to reasonable criticism and dissent.\" \n \n The Guardian reported further that AEI \"has received more than $1.6m from ExxonMobil, and more than 20 of its staff have worked as consultants to the Bush administration. Lee Raymond, a former head of ExxonMobil, is the vice-chairman of AEI's board of trustees,\" added The Guardian.\n",

   "Yeah, to be fair he really didn't lie on those issues but he did stretch the truth a bit. Saying the person died because of the insurance company seems a little unfounded. Furthermore, it is known this is a rare event and I'd venture a guess that it is no different with Medicare given the correct denial rates I posted in another thread. \n \n The real fact check is here: Obama&#8217;s Health Care Speech | FactCheck.org\n \n I'd like people to go to the insurance competition part. FactCheck corrected Obama but really the point remains and I actually agree with Obama on that issue. The thing Obama fails to realize is that federal regulation actually causes the lack of competition. Insurance companies for health have to be located within the state (like Anthem Alabama) so while Anthem is everywhere it is actually 50 different companies..or however many states they are in. This hinders growth and makes it difficult for a small company to compete. The overhead on following that many different rules is unreal. Combine that with the mountains of regulation you have to follow and no wonder you have Anthem controlling 75% of Alabama. Allow policies over state lines, give the policies back to the people...you will get competition and lower costs while only paying for care that is needed. \n \n Also, Obama wants to kill the competition anyway! I'm not sure why he brings it up like it's a problem. No insurance company can compete with a federal government who has an unlimited budget.",

   "Here's an update on the man from Il. that Obama used in his speech.\n \n\n SEPTEMBER 17, 2009 \n Obama Used Faulty Anecdote in Speech to Congress \n By JONATHAN WEISMAN \n WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama, seeking to make a case for health-insurance regulation, told a poignant story to a joint session of Congress last week. An Illinois man getting chemotherapy was dropped from his insurance plan when his insurer discovered an unreported gallstone the patient hadn't known about.\n \n \"They delayed his treatment, and he died because of it,\" the president said in the nationally televised address.\n \n In fact, the man, Otto S. Raddatz, didn't die because the insurance company rescinded his coverage once he became ill, an act known as recission. The efforts of his sister and the office of Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan got Mr. Raddatz's policy reinstated within three weeks of his April 2005 rescission and secured a life-extending stem-cell transplant for him. Mr. Raddatz died this year, nearly four years after the insurance showdown.\n Obama aides say the president got the essence of the story correct. Mr. Raddatz was dropped from his insurance plan weeks before a scheduled stem-cell transplant.\n \n In a letter, Babs Waldman, medical director of the Illinois attorney general's office, excoriated the insurer, Fortis Health, which is now Assurant Health. Mr. Raddatz \"suddenly faces not only life-threatening illness but now the inability to afford the only treatment that may help him,\" Dr. Waldman wrote to the insurer May 3, 2005.\n \n Peter Duckler, a spokesman for Assurant Health, said the company \"can never comment on an insured's coverage due to confidentiality issues.\"\n \n The patient's sister, Peggy M. Raddatz, testified before the House Energy and Commerce oversight subcommittee June 16 that her brother ultimately received treatment that \"extended his life approximately three years.\" Nowhere in the hearing did she say her brother died because of the delay. Ms. Raddatz didn't return calls seeking comment.\n Obama Used Faulty Anecdote in Speech to Congress - WSJ.com\n \n",
