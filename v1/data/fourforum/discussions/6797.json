That caused the ice age to begin and from the time of the FLUD to the time of Peleg there were lots of glaciers. But then, most of it melted and left the world as we see it today.",

   "I remember being fascinated as a school kid about Lake Agassiz, it being a part of Minnesota and thus having a special connection with me. I've had a chance to visit the area around Red Lake, which is a remnant of that mighty prehistoric lake. \n \n But I had never heard of Glacial Lake Missoula, and the cataclysmic event that shaped so much of the Northwest. I googled around a bit and enjoyed taking the virtual tour of the area affected by the lake and its runoff.\n \n It's too bad Creationists can't enjoy the wonder of this natural event. It's so much more satisfying to consider that a ice dam broke and caused the ensuing flood rather than contemplating a petulant god having a temper tantrum. Understanding how giant boulders caught a ride on ice floes and hitched a ride over great distances from their origin is more fascinating than trying to imagine two penguins waddling thousands of miles to catch a ride on a stupid wooden boat. Channeled scablands are better appreciated, IMO, as a result of rushing water and gravity than supposing a god carved it with his holy finger.\n \n In short, if you want to be filled with awe, take your superstitious blinders off.",

   "The only clear evidence we have is for one Ice Age.\nFalse. Funny how you talk about Oard but don't mention the authors of the article that you cite, Batten, Ham, Sarfati, and Wieland. Who could doubt the work of Oard?\n \n Of course, \"work\" and research are two quite different things, and Oard has done a lot of \"work\" in writing books with ad hoc answers but no research. First there was a lot of heat from the warm oceans, the hot subterranean water, volcanic activity (and Oard doesn't mention the latent heat released by the condensation of the vapor canopy), and then a cloud of ash shielded the earth from the sun (no such cloud mentioned in the Bible) and caused the ice age. If you are puzzled, so am I. This cloud reflected solar radiation back into space, Oard tells us, and caused the ice age. No mention of what happened to all of that other heat. Also, it doesn't explain how all of that ice could form and them melt again in about 700 years. And of course, this volcanic winter must have been a gread inconvenience to animals migrating back to their homelands from the ark. My bet is that real meteorologists get a good laugh out of that.\n \n If you notice, Mike Oard writes books about the Bible and not science.\n \n Anyone interested can get a short booklet from the USGS. That booklet begins, \"The Great Ice Age, a recent chapter in the Earth's history, was a period of recurring widespread glaciations.\" And that is just the last of the ice ages. For example, the Illinois State Museum states that \"...over 20 glacial advances and retreats have occurred during the last 2 million years.\" They seem to think that there is clear evidence for more than one ice age. I think that the difference may be that the USGS and the ISM actually looked at the ground and saw the multiple moraines, etc.\n \n For those of you interested in some real information about the last ice age you can get the USGS booklet here: The Great Ice Age\n \n If you are studying foolishness, then what will you be when you finish?",

In order to summarize something, you must first have something to summarize.

This brought him to mind.\n \n \nOf course, \"work\" and research are two quite different things, and Oard has done a lot of \"work\" in writing books with ad hoc answers but no research...If you notice, Mike Oard writes books about the Bible and not science.\n\n \n Have you read his books?

Learn what science is and how it operates. Ad hoc stories based on no evidence is not doing science. He may be working very hard at literary research in order to make his mythology sound scientific, but he isn't doing scientific research.\n \nOr do you mean that the genesis flood is not science?\nThe genesis flood is mythology.

What else would you research?\nI read the article that you linked that offered an ad hoc explanation. I didn't see any evidence of anyone doing scientific research. All I saw was evidence of some guy who knew the answer before he asked any questions, and who did some \"work\" at inventing alternate explanations of reality that ignored the facts.\n \nBy laying out the creation model for the Ice Age, Mike was simultaneously refuting the propaganda mixed with science that linked to. He addresses the uniformitarian models. Exactly what do you think he was writing about?\nHe was writing about biblical mythology. I thought he was selectively presenting facts that could be presented to support an invented story. There can't have been more than one ice age because the YEC mythology doesn't allow time, therefore there was only one ice age that lasted 700 years. Funny that no one mentioned it in the Bible.\n \nAn agnostic. :p\nThen read faster and hopefully you will mature past the foolish part.",
