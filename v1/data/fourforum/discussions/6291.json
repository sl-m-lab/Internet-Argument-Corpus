It is a good temporary measure that will give the financially savvy a chance to get out and dump the problem on those who are not as knowledgeable about economic matters. In the end that is pretty much all it can possibly do. This has not even hit the derivatives market yet. It will...it HAS to, it just isn't there yet.",

   "I believe there is such a high percentage of our population that will be damaged by the housing issue, that the Fed. will indeed damage the value of the dollar to accommodate the over priced houses on the market. If you think about it, its the Obi Wan Canobi (\"Our only hope\": Stars Wars) of the mortgage industry. The more financial institutions that claim bankruptcy directly means there are dollars in the economy that will never be redeemed to the Fed. This alone would deflate the dollar but this will not be enough to bounce housing into marketability. If housing stays unmarketable and people are forced into actually having to pay a note on their homes, the economic catastrophe will be one for the worlds history books. The scale of families living in homes they could never finance conventionally is massive. This is fine if housing where to continue its climb. But if at any point, housing stagnates, huge populations of home owners would be crushed when their respective special financing comes to term. When buying a home, it might be a good idea to see what the average income is for the area your buying. How many people in your area have the ability to come in behind you and carry the note? Looking at the average home costs in an area against the average incomes...Clearly one can see an issue that is not going away with out some painful readjusting. What does it mean in the end?? Fixed income people had better get used the the taste of cat food.",
