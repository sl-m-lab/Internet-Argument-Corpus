In my opinion, it's ludacrous to convict someone in the case of rape or murder on eyewitness testimony alone. I just think we need some format in place that holds our justice system accountable when it does make a mistake. I mean, hell, the agents of the system are human and will make errors!!",

The victim is an innocent who was executed on death row after being wrongly convicted of a crime.\n \n \n Recently I was reviewing a case I covered on Nightline a week back about the murder of Jarrod Davidson by his estranged (ex?) inlaws in a Parental Alienation case where his wife alleged sexual abuse.\n During the trial of the mother inlaw, the defense and prosecution were prohibited from mentioning motive in the murder case (revenge over alleged sexual abuse).\n Such events happen more often than not, where one side in court is prohibited from using evidence or justifications. You can often bias a jury with or without such, changing the outcome of a case.\n \n In the above event, the MiL was convicted of murder.\n \n Many people don't know how to deal with the police when questioned. In properly dealing with them, many think you're guilty and trying to cover your butt. \n Confessions are coerced...or even tossed out by decree later.\n Evidence suppressed for any number of 'technical' reasons.\n \n In the end, you'll have apologists claim 'Sure our system isn't perfect, but it's the best out there/' as a defense for mistakes that set the guilty free or punish the innocent.\n \n In the case of the death penelty, my personal experience at being falsly arrested (when a crime didn't even happen, someone just said one did) and the evendince the liberals pushed forward (*gasp* they didn't even whine about it or sound irrational when they did) led me to believe we can eliminate the death penalty (I still favor the idea) until we have a better system of judging.\n \n Most who support the death penalty, IMO, sound overly emotional and use the same tactics and rhetoric those who oppose the right to bear arms do.\n \n I see compensation for wrongs done by the gov't (representing the people) over miscarriages of justice as no different that wrongs don't by individuals or the gov't when other damages are done. \n It's neglegence quite often.\n \n Already forms of compensation exist for these cases.

   "First of all, as the individual who started this thread, I take offense to your comment relating to Nancy Grace. Since I don't watch TV, I don't know anything about the show. \n :xbanghead \n \n \nIn particular to the current topic, wrongful convictions occurring in our justice system is a fact!\nCongratulations! We all know this.\n \n \nHowever, the DA is partly to blame for wrongful conviction cases and whoever assumes that position should be held accountable for their actions. More importantly than simply placing blame on agents of the justice system, compensation for the wrongful convicted should be the main focus.\nPerhaps the jury, judge, DA, police, and defense attorney should pass around a hat?\n \n \nLastly, I know this is an open forum in which anyone can provide his/her opinion, based on grounded facts or speculation. But, I would encourage you to develop a rational and informed opinion on a specific matter before simply saying anything that sounds good. When you don't provide an informed opinion, you lose credibility.\n Touching emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nAbove all else, I just hope you are not in a position where you can influence changes or make decisions relating to this matter or any issue in the criminal justice system, because it's such irrational attitudes that are causing more harm to the system than actually progressing it.\nYes, it certainly is irrational to not want to punish someone for doing their job. \n \n Give me a break. You got a smarta-- post by me because you fail to do the same things you claim I am not doing.",

   "No compensation for the wrongly convicted. I'd support programs to get them back on their feet but to award damages is not going to solve anything. Wrongful convictions is a risk of the judicial system and to try and place blame is just stupid and solves nothing.\n \n Seems not many folks here know a DA or are a DA so naturally many might think that they are all malicious and out to convict you with no facts. Truth is, that is insanely rare and it isn't even in the interest of the drastically under paid DA to convict people that are innocent. \n \n Time to stop watching \"Nancy Grace\" on TV and get with what really happens.\n\n \n Two words:\n \n Mike Nifong",

Its like capturing someone who owed you money off the street, putting him in your basement, torturing him, then making him pay for the instruments you used for torture. People should not be forced to pay for things they don't want. If you don't want a convict to stay in prison because it is a financial burden, then let him out. Thats the way it works. If you want to have a working justice system, it will take some financial sacrifice.",

Why shouldn't the same happen for attorneys?\n \n \n \n \nThat doesn't pay the bills.

The idea is idiotic to even bring up in my opinion.\n\n \n There are cases when the prosecutor has gone overboard and has cost innocent men and women suffering. Also, the state is the one that put the person behind bars wrongly in the first place. That person deserves to be compensated, no question about that. My opinion is, if no individual can be held accountable, then the state must compensate the wrongly convicted, since they put him/her behind bars in the first place. If a person was convicted wrongly, then there must have been an error somewhere. There is no \"perfect framing\" where there were no discrepancies in the investigation or prosecution.\n \n \n \n \nIf the price of compensating wrongfully convicted felons is for DAs to stop seeking justice for those that actually did it then the system is broken in a more dangerous manner.\n\n \n What evidence do you have that this will happen? It didn't with doctors, what makes you think it will happen with prosecutors? I say we only blame the prosecutors if they were responsible for the wrongful conviction. If they are not, then it is the state's duty to compensate.",
