   "Jewish leader in Commonwealth of Independent States and Baltic States and president of Eurasian Industrial Association Mashkevich is trying to cover up his crime tracks in Berlin. \n As it's known on February 13, 2006 Kazakhstan opposition's strongman Altinbek Sarsenbaev was killed. Some time later the body of Mahomet Balaev (Chechen refugee, former field commander of Chechen rebels) was found in the forest near Berlin. Those murders in differing ends of the world turned out to be just links of one chain. The fact is that Berlin police succeeded in arresting of the killer. He is native of Kazakhstan. And there's strong rumor among Kazakhstan's &#1081;migr&#1081; strata here that he was hired by Mashkevich to eliminate Balaev as a participant of the bloody crime in Kazakhstan. To put it plain Balaev could make quite unpleasant revelations relating Jews' role in killing Sarsenbaev.\n It's well-know that Kazakhstan opposition leader Sarsenbaev crossed Jews' representative Mashkevich way who then ordered to kill him. Well, many people think that Sarsenbaev was not the man American Jewish lobby wanted to head opposition forces in Kazakhstan. Sarsenbaev's activities infringed on Jewish interests in Central Asia. I guess Jewish lobby in Washington has got some mighty rivals. And interests of the two opposing forces clashed in Central Asia in Kazakhstan. Well, they say Mashkevich organized Sarsenbaev's murder by using Berezovsky's ties with Chechen rebels.",
