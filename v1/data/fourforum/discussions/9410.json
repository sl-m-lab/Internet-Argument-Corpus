The few that come to mind are:\n 1. Was it a right decision to invade in the first place?\n 2. Now that we are there and things have progressed as they have, is it a right decision to stay for the time being or should we leave now?\n 3. Are we running the war in Iraq well?\n \n Anyway, many other posters have mentioned that you need to be more specific. I am just adding my own comments on that point.",
