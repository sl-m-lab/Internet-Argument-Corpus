   "While I think that the ruling was absolute garbage and nonsense, in any case, despite what all the liberal activists want to think, it was based on the STATE Constitution, and not the Federal Constitution. \n \n Do you know why?\n \n Because the text of the Federal Constitution and numerous court decisions have explicitly ruled that States are free to limit marriage to One man and One Woman, if they wish to do so.\n \n Further, all of the Full Faith and Credit claims by those on both the left and the right, are simply out of place.\n \n The General plan from the Homosexual Activists, is to get one or two states to legalize homosexual \"marriage\", then attempt to use the Full Faith and Credit Clause to force all other states to recognize their \"marriage.\"\n \n Guess, what, Constitutionally this is pure nonsense:\n \n Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state. And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts, records, and proceedings shall be proved, and the effect thereof.\n \n The United States Congress, with the 1996 Defense of Marriage act, Has done just that. They have ruled that no other state has to accept a homosexual \"marriage\" or \"civil union\" from states that choose to exercise stupidity. \n \n The United States Supreme Court was explicit in this fact in it's ruling in Williams V North Carolina 317 U.S. 287 (1942)\n \n Article IV, 1 of the Constitution not only directs that 'Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and Judicial Proceedings of every other State' but also provides that 'Congress may be general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.' Congress has exercised that power. By the Act of May 26, 1790, c. 11, 28 U.S.C. 687, 28 U.S.C.A. 687, Congress has provided that judgments 'shall have such faith and credit given to them in every court within the United States as they have by law or usage in the courts of the State from which they are taken.\n \n The Full Faith and Credit portions of DOMA were addressed by Federal Courts.\n \n As Judge Moody Found in Wilson v Ake, in regards to the Full Faith and Credit Clause:\n \n \"Congress' actions in adopting DOMA are exactly what the Framers envisioned when they\n created the Full Faith and Credit Clause. DOMA is an example of Congress exercising its\n powers under the Full Faith and Credit Clause to determine the effect that \"any public act,\n record, or judicial proceeding of any other State, territory, possession, or tribe respecting a\n relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage\" has on the other\n States. 28 U.S.C. \u00a71738C. Congress' actions are an appropriate exercise of its power to\n regulate conflicts between the laws of two different States, in this case, conflicts over the\n validity of same-sex marriages.\n \n Adopting Plaintiffs' rigid and literal interpretation of the Full Faith and Credit would\n create a license for a single State to create national policy. See Nevada v. Hall, 440 U.S. 410,\n 423-24 (1979)(\"Full Faith and Credit does not . . . enable one state to legislate for the other\n or to project its laws across state lines so as to preclude the other from prescribing for itself\n the legal consequences of acts within it.\")(quoting Pacific Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident\n Comm'n, 306 U.S. 493, 505-06 (1939)); Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U.S. 287, 296\n (1942) (\"Nor is there any authority which lends support to the view that the full faith and\n credit clause compels the courts of one state to subordinate the local policy of that state, as\n respects its domiciliaries, to the statutes of any other state.\"). The Supreme Court has clearly\n established that \"the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not require a State to apply another State's law in violation of its own legitimate public policy.\" Hall, 440 U.S. at 422 (citing\n Pacific Ins. Co, 306 U.S. at 493). Florida is not required to recognize or apply\n Massachusetts' same-sex marriage law because it clearly conflicts with Florida's legitimate\n public policy of opposing same-sex marriage. See infra pp. 9-18; Fla. Stat. \u00a7 741.212.6\n \n Allow me to further expand on Judge Moody's ruling.\n \n In Pacific Employers Ins Co V Industrial Accident Commission of California 306 US 493 (1939) The United States Supreme Court ruled : \"we think the conclusion is unavoidable that the full faith and credit clause does not require one state to substitute for its own statute, applicable to persons and events within it, the conflicting statute of another state, even though that statute is of controlling force in the courts of the state of its enactment with respect to the same persons and events.\"\n \n The court restated this principle in Sun Oil CO V Wortman 486 US 717 (1988) where it stated \"The Full Faith and Credit Clause does not compel a state to substitute the statutes of another state for its own statutes dealing with a subject matter concerning which it is competent to legislate.\"\n \n DOMA only clarify's the state's rights in statute. The right is inherent. It already exists. This is what I am afraid my fellow representatives don't realize, either out of complete ignorance of Constitutional law, or purposeful misinformation. States have always been free to disregard the laws of other states that conflict with their own strong public policy.\n \n Let me further expound on this, An important legal principle called the Conflict of Laws, allows states or nations that have a strong public policy exception to the laws of another state or nation, to enforce their own principles.\n \n The Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws #283(2) (1971) states the general rule as follows:\n \n A marriage which satisfies the requirements of the state where the marriage was contracted will everywhere be recognized as valid unless it violates the strong public policy of another state.\n \n Despite the basic rule that a marriage valid where contracted is valid everywhere, the courts and validation statutes have universally recognized a number of exceptions, In Fattibene v. Fattibene, 183 Conn. 433, 441 A.2d 3 (1981) (The court ruled that Connecticut need not recognize marriage that violates strong public policy of state).\n \n In re Estate of Loughmiller, 229 Kan. 584, 629 P.2d 156 (1981) (The Court listed exceptions to validation statute, including marriage that is polygamous, incestuous, or prohibited by the state for public policy reason).\n \n K. v. K., 90 Misc. 2d 183, 393 N.Y.S.2d 534 (Fam. Ct. 1977) (The court was called upon to decide whether law of Poland, which requires civil ceremony in addition to religious ceremony, was repugnant to the public policy of New York).\n \n Kelderhaus v. Kelderhaus, 21 Va. App. 721, 467 S.E.2d 303 (1996) (The Court ruled that marriage's validity is to be determined by law of state where marriage took place, unless result would be repugnant to Virginia public policy).\n \n So long as a State Has either a State Constitutional Amendment OR a Public Policy Exception then it would be safe from activists redefining marriage in that state. Homosexuals whose \"marriage\" were conducted in Massachusetts WOULD NOT be valid in other states, Provided the state has a Public Policy Exception or State Constitutional Amendment. (Even the harshest Critics of The Defense of Marriage act have acknowledged this fact.)\n \n Let me refer back to Williams V North Carolina 317 U.S. 287 (1942)\n \n The Constitution of the United States, however, reserves authority over marriage and divorce to each of the forty-eight states. That is our starting-point... We are not authorized nor are we qualified to formulate a national code of domestic relations.There may be some who think our modern social life is such that there is today a need, as there was not when the Constitution was framed, for vesting national authority over marriage and divorce in Congress, just as the national legislatures of Canada and Australia have been vested with such powers. Beginning in 1884, numerous proposals to amend the Constitution to confer such authority have been introduced in Congress. But those whose business it is to amend the Constitution have not seen fit to amend it in this way.\n \n \n The only way Activists can impose a Homosexual \"marriage\" on all 50 states, is to do so with an Amendment. \n \n Congress cannot impose ANY federal domestic relations code on the states, and neither can the Supreme Court.",

(2/3 of states)\n \n A country that uses judges to determine such sweeping things as redefining marriage is a \"legistocracy\", which we are quickly turning into as a nation.

But that doesn't mean we should have to redefine marriage to do it.\n \n As I said, states have the ability to amend their constitution to protect the institution of marriage from redefinition, and 13 states have already done so--many others are working on it. You should probably get used to it. Marriage is just too important to too many people to be redefined so easily.",

   "From the ruling:\n \n http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=581839\n \n \n\"The state's protracted denial of equal protection cannot be justified simply because such constitutional violation has become traditional,\" \n\n \n \n \n \nDo the words \"govt. by the people and for the people\" not matter to you at all? Furthermore, to say that the constitution shouldn't be allowed under the vote of the people itself in unconstitutional, since that's the only way the Constitution CAN be amended. (2/3 of states)\n\n \n If it means that all it takes is a popularity contest to deny civil rights, yes, it is wrong. Whats next? The Roman Catholics decides to ammend the constitution to establish itself as the state religion? It is convievable. I think it is disgusting to even consider using the constitution to deny anyone civil rights based no nothing more than \"tradition\", which is all the antis have.\n \n \nA country that uses judges to determine such sweeping things as redefining marriage is a \"legistocracy\", which we are quickly turning into as a nation. Even though judges are supposed to interpret the constitution, it's still putting the fate of the people in the hands of individuals regarding their laws. This is not very far removed from monarchy. Personally, I think our founding fathers and the Constitutional framers are rolling over in their graves right now.\n\n \n I think they \"are rolling over in their graves right now\" to think the constitution would be used as a weapon to deny such a basic right.\n \n \n \n \nYours is the voice of a bitter gay person talking, who has only seen one side of things (probably hardship). But there are many good examples of the population being informed and doing things right. In fact I think typcially, the populace DOES take care of people--I think Americans are generally pretty humanitarian people. That's my opinion.\n\n \n I agree, the Americans are generally a humanitarian people. I also think that most Americans are truly uninformed when it comes to the issue of same sex marriage. They are prejudiced based on \"traditional\" religious dogma they have been conditioned to believe since childhood, and are either unwilling or unable to think for themselves in a rational, objective manner.\n \n \nI think the reason there has been resistance to redefine marriage is that people really know  that this is not a civil rights issue, despite attempts by the gay lobby to paint it that way.

You should probably get used to it. Marriage is just too important to too many people to be redefined so easily.\n\n \n Marriage is too important to be left to the whims of a popularity contest based on \"traditional\" religious dogmatic prejudice. As I mentioned above, assuming such a constitutional ammendment would pass, what is the next right to be denied to which group, simply because they lack more than a 2/3 popularity opinion?",

   "Do the words \"govt. by the people and for the people\" not matter to you at all? Furthermore, to say that the constitution shouldn't be allowed under the vote of the people itself in unconstitutional, since that's the only way the Constitution CAN be amended. (2/3 of states)\n\n \n Those words mean a lot to me, but they don't mean \"majority rule\" they mean government designed to protect all of its people. The Federal government is designed in a manner which will ensure that; it is not the majority which has the power to ammend the Federal Constitution, it is 2/3 of state legislatures. On the Federal level, the power of the majority is kept in check by the power of the Federal government and the power of the Federal government is kept in check by the power of the majority. The founders of our country knew what they were doing. That doesn't happen on state levels; in states the majority tends to reign supreme, and if the majority decides to perscute, the majority will persecute.\n \n In our country, the \"voice of the people\" is made out to be such a great thing, but the voice of the majority needs to be kept in check too. The voice of the majority sometimes says we should keep slavery, put groups of people with a different set of beliefs to death, deny freedom of religion, deny freedom of speech, or one of many other horrors as seen throughout history. Sometimes it says good things too, but the voice of the people is as likely to tyrannize as it is to bring freedom.\n \n \nA country that uses judges to determine such sweeping things as redefining marriage is a \"legistocracy\", which we are quickly turning into as a nation. Even though judges are supposed to interpret the constitution, it's still putting the fate of the people in the hands of individuals regarding their laws. This is not very far removed from monarchy. Personally, I think our founding fathers and the Constitutional framers are rolling over in their graves right now.\n\n \n In truth, I don't know what our founders would think; I do not believe that they would be happy with the form of our state governments, but I do feel they designed the courts to prevent government from stripping away freedom and equality from the minority, and that is what the court is doing. Although the founders intended the courts to interpret the Constitution, they intended the Constitution to protect rights, not to be a mere reflection of the will of\n the majority.\n \n \nYours is the voice of a bitter gay person talking, who has only seen one side of things (probably hardship). But there are many good examples of the population being informed and doing things right. In fact I think typcially, the populace DOES take care of people--I think Americans are generally pretty humanitarian people. That's my opinion.\n\n \n My words may be bitter, and you're right that I've likely only experienced one side of things. But I agree that Americans are pretty humanitarian, I understand that the majority has probably done some good, and I apologize for not focusing on the good things the majority has done. But my point is that the majority is not always good. I do think the majority tries to take care of its people, and I do think they've got good intentions. But the majority is rarely informed; few understand that government exists to protect freedom, equality, and happiness, not to make sure others live as you see fit. Their choices are often arbitrary, and the majority too often feels that it is in the best interest of others to be forced to live like the majority.\n \n \nI think the reason there has been resistance to redefine marriage is that people really know that this is not a civil rights issue, despite attempts by the gay lobby to paint it that way. I will say this though: gay people need to be treated as well as anyone else in this country and acts of violence should not be permitted. We should all be able to get along. But that doesn't mean we should have to redefine marriage to do it.\n\n \n I think it does; I mean, one is not doing the good thing to claim that a specific group of people should be protected from violence if it is followed up by \"But they should not have access to the same rights that we have.\" And in truth, I don't understand that the claim is not a civil rights issue. Marriage is a civil right, and we're talking about extending it. We should all be able to get along, and we should be able to get along because no one is denied the same rights that another person has without a really good reason for it.\n \n \nAs I said, states have the ability to amend their constitution to protect the institution of marriage from redefinition, and 13 states have already done so--many others are working on it. You should probably get used to it. Marriage is just too important to too many people to be redefined so easily.\n\n \n Yet the marriage of those people is not being redefined; what is important to them is staying the same, we're just allowing more people to participate. Trust me when I say that I am used to the voice of the majority hurting people. I have not seen it do anything else. I don't doubt that the majority will change the Constitution to take away rights from the minority; they always tend to do it at first, but that does not mean I won't try to work with what I've got, to change that voice.",
