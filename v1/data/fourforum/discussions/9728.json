   "I don't think you can steriotype the gun control debate when it comes to religion. Stances on the issue of Firearm ownership differ wildly all over the place. Opinions mostly seem to be drawn from a person's individual experiences. \n \n For instance: people who have has to deal with a personal tragedy involving gun violence are likly to have like opinions to the anti-gun crusaders due to having a strong emotional need for justice against something they blame for their personal pain. It's far easier to just blame the gun then deal with the real issues. Followers always take the path of least resistence. \n \n Also you have the causeheads. The folks that get themselves all worked up about some cause or annother just to get attention. \n \n Anti-gun sentiment is always emotionaly driven with no real facts or data or any kind of rational thought to back it up. Religion has little to do with it. There are many people of All sects of religous denominations that are heavily anti-gun as well as many Athiests and Agnostics. Religion has little bearing. \n \n The Steriotype that perpetuates religion and gun-ownership I think comes from the phrase \"Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition\" which is originally a lyric in a song written by Frank Loesser in 1942 in response to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Nothing to do with Gun ownership. It was simply a battlecry of WW2.",
