   "We are facing a number of serious problems. Have Obama and his team spend to much time and effort on Health Care and not enough on other issues? Just to list a few such as:\n \n Unemployment\n Economy\n Financial Reforms\n Homeland Security\n Foreign Relations\n Middle East Peace\n Illegal Aliens\n Afghanistan\n National Debt\n \n Health care appears to be dead. Unemployment is still at 10%. The economy is stagnant. Financial reforms are in the works. Homeland security needs to be improved. Foreign relations and peace in the ME seems to have come to a grinding halt. Illegal aliens are still here.\n Afghanistan will continue for many years. The national debt is out of control and keeps on rising. \n \n Where are the lights at the end of the tunnel? Endlessly blaming GWB, corrupt politicians on both sides, greedy bankers and power hungry union bosses does nothing to improve these issues. Washington is out of control and the citizens are becoming restless and angry. Between now and November both parties will make major efforts to protect or increase their turf rather than working together for the benefit of the country. \n \n WHAT NEXT?\n \n Obama's State of the Union message should be very interesting.",
