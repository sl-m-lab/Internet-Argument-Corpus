   "I'm reposting an argument I've already made to show why, if the homosexual community really wanted to just attain certain rights which married couples have, they could accomplish those rights without forcing the redefining of marriage on the larger straight community in America. But it isn't so much marriage they seek than the express normalization of their lifestyle be forced on the larger community.\n I concur that each person in our society deserves equal rights. But redefining marriage is not about equal rights but about adding special rights to our laws and Constitution. Currently we all have the same right to marry a person of the opposite sex who is of a certain age and background. We don't give people the right to marry their siblings. We don't give people the right to marry a young child. As a society we have placed certain limits on marriage but give everyone the equal right to marry under those specified conditions.\n \n When we redefine marriage, then all sorts of new relationships will also vie for social acceptance. Already the legalization of same-sex marriage in one state had resulted in the call for the legalization of polygamy. Some gay activists are calling for the legalization of polyamory (multiple sexual relationships with multiple partners) because they see that as a two pronged approach to get what they want. \n \n We should also realize that the government is not prohibiting homosexuals from engaging in their behavior or even having a partner. All government is saying is that it is not going to redefine marriage to include same-sex relationships. And when citizens of this country have been given an opportunity to vote on a constitutional amendment in their state defining marriage, they have overwhelmingly approved of the traditional definition of marriage.\n \n As we have already noted, the push for same-sex marriage has been more about respect and acceptance than it has been about rights. If government recognizes the legal validity of gay marriage, then that places government's \"seal of approval\" on homosexuality.\n \n Often when gay activists are calling for equal rights, they are really asking for special benefits. Homosexuals have the same right to marry as heterosexuals. They have the right to marry a qualified person (age, marital status) of the opposite sex. Homosexuals and heterosexuals cannot marry someone of the same sex, someone who is too young, someone who is already married, etc.\n \n But the activists argue that because they cannot marry someone of the same sex, they lose out on certain benefits. But that is not a justification for redefining marriage. It may be a justification for reconsidering the benefits we provide as a society as Sarah Palin did as Governor of Alaska, but it isn't a justification for changing the definition of marriage.\n \n Consider the issue of visitation rights. Gay activists argue that government needs to grant same-sex marriage rights to homosexuals so they will have visitation rights. But again, this may be an argument for changing the laws concerning visitation as Sarah Palin did in Alaska, but it isn't an argument for redefining marriage.\n \n A bigger question is whether this is really a problem. In this day where major corporations and governmental entities are granting domestic partnership rights, it is difficult to see this as a problem. If such a case were brought to light people could use public pressure to force the hospital to change its policies.\n \n So redefining marriage is another attempt by homosexual activists to normalize homosexuality in the larger social context because it isn't necessary to redefine marriage in order to deal with the social issues which are seen as inequities by the homosexual community. Can you deny that these arguments are valid, rational and correct regarding the downside of redefining marriage for the sake of offering your small community special rights?",

People are really noticing internationally what is happeneing. Much more so than when marriage simply, quietly, passed the first time. Everyone is engaged, right now like never before.

The fact protesting is constitutional is COMPLETELY beside the point here. NO WHERE am I claiming or arguing it's not constitutional for you to do so. Yes, it's constitutional. We all know that. Not even sure what the POINT of you bringing that up here was.\n\n The point is this.\n It's not a case where you tell \"everyone on the street\" that they are stupid.\n You tell SPECIFIC PEOPLE who are ALREADY PREJUDICED AGAINST YOU that they are \"stupid\" (to continue using the analogy)...\n \n One clear sign of bigotry is how the Prop 8 proponents put out GROTESQUE LIES about what not having Prop 8 will do. \n *Forcing churches to perform gay marriage*???\n *Children taught gay marriage in school*???\n When you have these people LYING about what your equal rights will do, what chance do you think there is that they were EVER going to vote for your rights in the first place?\n \n As for the OTHER people in the street...\n The ones who aren't being called \"stupid\", they should recognize what is REALLY going on here instead of taking offense cause somebody else is being called \"stupid\". Can the other people EXPLAIN WHY those people who are lying about gay marriage are not \"stupid\" (to continue using the analogy)???\n \n With that said, there are some protest actions I have already clearly stated that I do not support.\n \n \n \nWho said I don't think it's repugnant for Christians to lie about gays or anything else??

   "But Jewish or Christian behavior obviously needs protection...\n I am routinely struck by how people who argue against such protections do little more than reveal their own prejudice for homosexuality.\n\n \n You cannot [fundamentally] exercise prejudice against a behavior... that is not logical. But judgment is, and yes... judgment is reserved [as a basic element of human character and faculty of reason] is specifically there just for that - to render decisions based on what is right, wrong, good, bad... healthy, unhealthy... etc. That argument is never going to going that argument to reasonable to people. Homosexuality is a behavior, and like all behavior is subject to evaluation based on moral principle, personal expedience, social acceptance... and a host of other considerations like all other behavior and its value is subject to personal self valuation, but what is commonly known as beneficial or not beneficial. \n \n So, yes... they do reveal a moral judgment on the behavior consistent with their convictions and are not double-minded about it.\n \n \n \n \n\"knowing it's wrong\" The anti-gay mind typically simply PRESUMES its wrong,\n\n \n That is the twisted pathology of the mind that supports the deviant sexual proclivity. The only presumption is the erroneous moral equivocation that goes on with the the mind that is entrenched in the indulgence. If your were truly correct... there would have been social changes to support your opinion throughout history - before the day were are living in, I know of abolitionists who put their lives and property on the line for their convictions about the equality of ethnicity... but you don't hear a peep from the purveyors of this behavior because they cannot show cause in the historical moral equivocation and moral [as well as] social support of this sex act. History will only bear out individual choice and the prime motivator... and that is all it is today. Their cannot be two truths here, either one is right and the other is wrong... but both cannot be true and there simply is not evidence to support the feeling that homosexuality is anything more that one's own personal indulgence.\n \n \n \neither by the fact they have been told to believe that or by religious indoctrination, which is the same thing. There is no \"knowing it's wrong\". If there were, you could SHOW WHY homosexuality is \"wrong\".\n\n \n You have a glaring ignorance of religion and shouldn't be opening your mouth about it... with the intent of supporting a debate talking point. Because you'll find you are indulging you're \"religion\" of lawlessness when you come to understand the what the word means. The word is a Koinae Greek word... the prefix: \"re\" means \"return to\" like recycle... that main body: \"legios\" - \"the law\" or for short \"return to the law\". Well the question would be who's law\" As religion is a purely man made institution. The ignorant secularist points the finger in in complete rebellion over what he feels is in the way of him living his life in the manner he wants... and cites often [like a child put on restriction] the reason why they are angry. No different here... you have big children ticked off because they have to behave and an overwhelming majority of people despise the behavior anyway. Not understanding that to the Christian [who gets picked on the most without cause] knows [if they know their Word] just how God feels about religion... He is no fan of it, as a matter of fact quickly reduces it to nothing more than human benevolence in the Book of James... there are other references scripturally that let us know in no uncertain terms how The Almighty feels about our humane \"righteousness\"... so we don't hang anything on religion either. \n \n The dumb Christian cannot defend his position and is in clear violation of scripture by the Apostle Peter, so he loses his witness right there, and will be [spiritually] be held accountable for it. Now the \"law\" for the humanist is lawlessness... they are governed by an aspect of the 2nd. law of thermodynamics... entropy. They are in a constant state of flux and decay. They reasoning is unreasonable, clarity is disparity to them because it calls for them to draw clear distinction between right and wrong... common sense is the common enemy because it is too pervasive, and cannot hide form that - it is only survived by the consensus of like-minded moral reprobates in a position to act to support their view point - we call them liberal legislators or judicial activists. \n \n \n \n \nOne of the other things that dominates in too much anti-gay posting is the obvious lie that gays are \"already protected\" or already have \"equal rights\".\n\n \n You speak out of rank ignorance... gays are people first, people have rights... and protections, which you have - not behavior always. You don't need a separate set of laws to cover the behavior. Laws draw lines for what behavior is right and socially justifiable.., and those which are socially detrimental. The latter is clearly... if left unchecked will be the very end of us, it was for Greece and Rome... you have your historical models there, we don't need to follow suit. You have \"equal rights\" as a human being... you do not have an equal right to be gay. \n \n \n \n \nWe supposedly have \"protections under the law\", but then explain to me how gay men still get fired for being gay. \n\n \n You do... it is the nature of that depravity that sets people off, and an employer has the right to set a tempo for quality or moral fortitude of their work environment. Do you think a murderer will stay employed very long after they are discovered? No... same with a pedophile, drug dealer or any other social deviant. Law protects the ability to reason not what is right in your own eyes... but what is set forth by the existing laws of the land and look at what is fundamentally self destructive - therefore socially destructive if not addressed... that is the whole premise of law, I think you miss that and is the fundamental difference between conservative legal arguments which are based on the notion of lawfulness [morally clear] and liberals [legality...or \"fiat\" meaning \"let it be\" ...for me] which is woefully one-sided in its approach to understanding law and striking a balance with society at large, the behavior you defend has never, ever historically done that.\n \n \n \n \nExplain to me how we have legislation that prevents people from adopting if they are gay.\n \n \n Easy... ever wonder why states issue marriage licenses? They do it because as an institution, marriage is responsible [in principle] for bringing the next generation, and is inherently heterosexual by nature. Adults... who start off as children [in case you ever wondered] need to have the same familiar upbringing as children who did not have that. They can make whatever \"choices\" they want to when they become adults, but same rules apply. Not every decision is going to be a popular one... this is one of them, marriage licenses [like all state issues licenses] are granted on the bases that relationship will be held in faith and managed by sound moral turpitude, and can be [just like a sales or drivers license] revoked if violated... marriage is a privilege not a right. \n \n \n \nExplain to me how we used to have laws which prevent gay sex.\n\n \n \n Laws banning sodomy are logic based, and should [in my opinion] should be reinstated. If you loose the law on the books.. you revise the level of social relevance. It was wrong for Texas and a few other states to remove the laws. But it does reinforce the line drawn that levels your argument that it ever had social relevance here until recently. If it has a benefit... the benefit would be timeless, but if it is a detriment... the ill will be timeless - resolved.\n \n \n \nOh wait. The last one WAS stricken down by the \"protections\" under the constitution. The ones that people like DR complain about when they argue \"homosexual behavior\" has no \"place at the table with liberties so many of our forefathers laid their lives down for\".\n\n \n That was one of the ill effects of the Texas high court ruling, but... it look outside of US law to come up with that ruling. French \"humanist\" law has no bearing here, and if it is determined that it is overall, bad law - which it was... it will get repealed and overturned.\n \n \n \nCause you see, people like DR argue at it from both ends. They proclaim that we supposedly \"have\" protections, and that it is depraved for us to have protections... Yeah. I know. It's got to border on absurd if not a full fledged resident...\n\n \n \n No, there's and has only been one truth here, and the burden of proof on the alternative lifestyle crowd is in fact proving to that lifestyle is protected by the US Constitution... I see they still haven't found that yet.\n \n \n \n \n\"sexually promiscuous\"?\n One of the other things that strike me about DR and Archie is how they repeatedly utilize obvious excuses for their tactics.\n\n \n \n One thing that is clearly evident in the baseless defense for a behavior you attempt to trivialize or play down that is commonly known as anything other what you are claiming the behavior you support is. Remember... other people have to see this the way your do... and they just don't. And all these riots and civic unrest and grand mal hissy fits they are having isn't reinforcing a \"struggle\" for equal rights... but as lawless looking for a fight. They just may get it... and if so, you won't have a leg to stand on.\n \n \n \nPersonally, if somebody wanted to talk about discriminating against \"sexually promiscuous\", that's ANOTHER SUBJECT. My partner and I are monogamous. I have pointed to research in the past which demonstrates most gays are NOT \"sexually promiscuous\". But the anti-gay approach typically doesn't care...\n\n \n \n The behavior is inherently promiscuous... you either dismiss or do not understand what the word truly means, monogamy has nothing to do with it.\n \n \n \nMoreover, you have STRAIGHT people who are sexually promiscuous, and people like DR and Archie don't demand that the government discriminates against them like they want the government to discriminate against gay people.\n\n \n I never made a distinction between the two as that is not the argument... there are laws that openly [and should[ discriminate against wanton, lascivious behavior regardless of hetero or homo... but the latter cannot be explained to children when they see PDA's on the street... \n \n \n \nDemonstrating, their claimed excuse is a lie.\n It has nothing REALLY to do with \"sexually promiscuous\", except as an excuse to harass gays...\n\n \n \n This statement by yours is irrational and is nothing but baseless talking points, let me set the record straight before you start itching and glithcing... if homosexuals were truly treated one tenth as bad as the rhetoric and propaganda would lead others to falsely believe. Do you really think we'd be having this discussion right now? Do you think there would be a gay lobby? Truth is your are doing nothing but propagating a lie... and nothing more, and your points may be convenient to your perspective but have no rational basis for consideration.",

Prejudice and bigotry THRIVE in the deep, dark caverns of blatant ignorance and delusion.\n WE ARE LIVING in the history of changing societal opinion.\n Throughout history, we have had MANY examples of essentially MODERN prejudice revolutions.\n \n What you don't seem to get is that MOST prejudices have a LONGER history of existing than they have a history of being overturned by government.\n Blacks have a LONGER history of employment discrimination than they have a history of having employment discrimination protection.\n \n Your self-proclaimed \"evidence\" is not only lacking in REAL perspective, it lacks reality!\n \n \n \nYou have a glaring ignorance of religion and shouldn't be opening your mouth about it...\n\n blah, blah, blah...\n You have this habit of talking, but saying incredibly little.\n NONE of your follow-on rant has any relevance to the topic.\n NONE of your follow-on rant shows ANYWHERE where I was wrong or \"ignorant\" of religion.\n \n My point was simple, and you completely avoided it.\n There is no REAL REASON for discriminating or looking down upon gays.\n Religion TELLS people how to think, and that is THE major source for prejudice against gays...\n \n \n \nYou speak out of rank ignorance... gays are people first, people have rights... and protections, which you have - not behavior always.\n\n By this idiotic reasoning, we don't need protection for ANYBODY.\n After all, blacks, Jews, women, handicapped, etc, etc, are \"people first\" and \"people have rights\".\n Ergo, we don't need protection against religious, racial, gender, etc, etc, discrimination.\n \n I can't help but think that if people would stop and THINK, they wouldn't try to say the stuff you try...\n \n \n \nYou don't need a separate set of laws to cover the behavior. Laws draw lines for what behavior is right and socially justifiable..\n\n You are very incomplete there.\n Our constitution is more concerned with establish PROTECTION of people from societal prejudice.\n If society doesn't find \"Jews\" or \"blacks\" socially acceptable, our constitution PROTECTS the minority.\n \n \n \n...and those which are socially detrimental. The latter is clearly... if left unchecked will be the very end of us, it was for Greece and Rome...\n\n More false claims.\n Just cause a civilization allowed homosexuality and that civilization ended does not mean it ended because of homosexuality.\n In reality, Rome moved towards CHRISTIANITY in its last century, which condemned homosexuality. By your logic, that move should have SAVED the civilization.\n \n Like many people who oppose homosexuality without intelligent reasons, you see two things and automatically claim \"cause and effect\" without putting one iota of thought into it.\n \n \n \nWe supposedly have \"protections under the law\", but then explain to me how gay men still get fired for being gay. \n\n \nYou do... it is the nature of that depravity that sets people off, and an employer has the right to set a tempo for quality or moral fortitude of their work environment. Do you think a murderer will stay employed very long after they are discovered?\n\n 1) I want people to notice exactly how DR has flipped on his earlier statement.\n He claimed gays have \"protections under the law\", and when I point out we DO NOT have full protection under the law, he quickly turns around AND TRIES TO JUSTIFY the lack of protection under the law.\n I've seen this trick pulled on anti-gay people dozens of times before, and it amazes me how quickly they fall for it.\n They try to pretend we aren't discriminated against, and then when you POINT OUT actual discrimination, they quickly run to JUSTIFY what they claimed didn't exist... emoticon_ic\n \n 2) Murder is illegal.\n Homosexuality is not.\n REALLY bad example.\n \n \n \nEasy... ever wonder why states issue marriage licenses?\n\n No.\n I know why states issue marriage licenses.\n It started shortly after the civil war when people realized that blacks and whites could conceivably \"marry\".\n Marriage LICENSES were quickly instituted in order to provide the government a way to say \"no\".\n Marriage licenses started out AS A FORM OF DISCRIMINATION.\n \n Your follow-on blather was inaccurate and unfounded, so I'm just going to correct you and move on...\n \n \n \nthis is one of them, marriage licenses [like all state issues licenses] are granted on the bases that relationship will be held in faith and managed by sound moral turpitude, and can be [just like a sales or drivers license] revoked if violated... marriage is a privilege not a right. \n\n I'm sorry, but WHAAAAT????\n No. Marriage licenses are not \"revoked\" by the state.\n A PARTICIPANT in the marriage can ask the state for legal recognition of dissolution, but the STATE ITSELF doesn't give a damn what happens inside that existing marriage.\n The wife and husband could be only into anal sex. The state doesn't care.\n The wife and husband could both be sterile and incapable of having kids. The state doesn't care.\n The wife and husband could be VERY fertile, but proceed to abort every pregnancy. The state doesn't care.\n \n Furthermore, marriage is NOT a \"privilege\". It IS a right.\n Your ignorance of that fact is just one of many examples of how you don't have a clue what is going on around you...\n \n Loving v Virginia: \"The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.\"\n \n \n \nLaws banning sodomy are logic based, and should [in my opinion] should be reinstated.\n\n The only \"logic\" involves somebody who prizes the capability of society to perpetuate prejudice over protecting civil liberties.\n It has no \"benefit\" to society, except to satisfy the prejudice of those who don't like gays.\n \n \n \nThat was one of the ill effects of the Texas high court ruling, but... it look outside of US law to come up with that ruling. French \"humanist\" law has no bearing here, and if it is determined that it is overall, bad law - which it was... it will get repealed and overturned.\n\n Dishonesty is to be expected...\n The ruling like MANY court rulings, did look at foreign law.\n But its core FIRMLy resides in the U.S. constitution and U.S. legal precedent.\n We did not overturn sodomy laws just cause of the French.\n \n Furthermore, I welcome you to point out where in the ruling it made ANY mention of \"France\".... emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nNo, there's and has only been one truth here, and the burden of proof on the alternative lifestyle crowd is in fact proving to that lifestyle is protected by the US Constitution... I see they still haven't found that yet.\n\n Again, very wrong.\n The constitution requires the government to show a \"legitimate state interest\" before the government is allowed to discriminate.\n If you LOOK at the 14th amendment, it does not specify race. It does not specify gender. It does not specify religion.\n It mentions none of those.\n \n The standard is simple...\n The constitution requires the government to show a \"legitimate state interest\" before the government is allowed to discriminate.",

Prejudice and bigotry THRIVE in the deep, dark caverns of blatant ignorance and delusion. WE ARE LIVING in the history of changing societal opinion.\n Throughout history, we have had MANY examples of essentially MODERN prejudice revolutions.\n\n \n You are living for an age of social acceptance.. therefore openly wage war against that which has universally condemned what you find so impoirtant... which has been useless for society in general regardless of culture. No one cares but you... and book produced by minds like yours need to be ignored so don't even go there. Yes, you are right the deep, dark, craven.. lust filled, myopic caverns of self willed delusion are for those who need a society to be off guard to accept their lifestyle. Problem is... you can't fool genetics and you cannot fool straight people - they aren't buying it. Your lifestyle just does not have the social standing you feel it ought to... attrition is not going to help you - though that is your hope, but you hope in vain. The people have spoken and they have said no! We are not bigiots because of the natural reposne we have to homosexual activity - you are bigots because you act against your nature and despise it... you are far closer to the natural definition of bigotry that those who reject your behavior.\n \n \n \n \nWhat you don't seem to get is that MOST prejudices have a LONGER history of existing than they have a history of being overturned by government. Blacks have a LONGER history of employment discrimination than they have a history of having employment discrimination protection.\n\n \n Moot argument... and irrelevant, you behavior has nothing to do with someones ethnicity. The fact that you still drag that tried old argument to the surface to defend rank and disgusting behavior is is abject stupidity.

Reinforcement of positive behavior is proof of acceptance of good behavior and rejection of bad behavior is proof of non-acceptable behavior there buddy.. it has always been that way. It's pretty simple, but only figures you don't even get that. \n \n B) Homosexual behavior is and will always be rejected behavior for the most common sense reasons. Now, what we don't' know about you - preserves you. What we do know about you may be your own undoing if outside the the societal norms of that culture. Here homosexuality is not healthy nor normal... and has been categorically rejected, but are survived by the grace of those who live and let live. Grace should be sufficient.\n \n \n \n \nBy this idiotic reasoning, we don't need protection for ANYBODY.\n After all, blacks, Jews, women, handicapped, etc, etc, are \"people first\" and \"people have rights\". Ergo, we don't need protection against religious, racial, gender, etc, etc, discrimination.\n\n \n The \"right\" to freely engage in a deviant sexual proclivity is not yours. The fact that you cannot separate you from the sex act is disturbing in itself... we have a word for that - pathological.\n \n \n \n \nYou are very incomplete there.\n Our constitution is more concerned with establish PROTECTION of people from societal prejudice. If society doesn't find \"Jews\" or \"blacks\" socially acceptable, our constitution PROTECTS the minority.\n\n \n \n No, you in vain try to stretch those protections to cover a multitude of ridiculous behavior it was never designed to protect. For the last time... refrain from trying to drag people of color into dirty little muckfest... your behavior is wrong, not their color.\n \n \n \n \nMore false claims.\n Just cause a civilization allowed homosexuality and that civilization ended does not mean it ended because of homosexuality.\n In reality, Rome moved towards CHRISTIANITY in its last century, which condemned homosexuality. By your logic, that move should have SAVED the civilization.\n\n \n \n Yes it does... once you grey the lines between morally acceptable and personally acceptable. Their is no morel \"truth\" and the truth became what is right in the eyes of the person doing whatever. When moral clarity collapses - so does society. Read Pricipa Ethica by G.E. Moore... it'll shed some light on that.\n \n \n \nLike many people who oppose homosexuality without intelligent reasons, you see two things and automatically claim \"cause and effect\" without putting one iota of thought into it.\n\n \n \n Don't even go there... there is not logical reason to support bio-illogical behavior. So stop it, if your natural biological disposition doesn't do it enough... gee, what do you need as proof?

I used other references including marriage. Those licenses can get revoked on grounds of moral turpitude, marriage is dissolved for the same thing... it's called divorce. You have no argument here... \n \n \nFurthermore, marriage is NOT a \"privilege\". It IS a right.\n Your ignorance of that fact is just one of many examples of how you don't have a clue what is going on around you...\n\n \n \n No... the proof that just shut your mouth mouth is that fact that you have to have a license issued.

Rather than listen to your listless lip dribble... please provide proof that religion is a religion, and do so without your typical subterfuge. Do that or kindly shut it.\n\n Religion is a behavior. I have already explained why. If you're looking for proof, stop ignoring what you have already been given.\n You ignored my reasons, and simply repeat yourself with nonsensical additions.\n I don't hate religion. I am simply observing that \"behavior\" is not an automatic safe haven for discrimination.\n By your mentality, our government could \"discriminate\" against people that wear yarmulkes.\n \n \n \nNo, that is what you do... and voices like yours.

Your feelings and ideals are not facts, you conclusions are as random and arbitrary as the theories you base them on.\n\n Over and over again you do the same thing. Your replies often consist of little more than chest beating and denial without explanation.\n So, I am simply going to label them as such, and repeat the argument you avoided.\n \n I gave a definition for \"secular\" to counter your claim that it involves \"lawlessness\".\n You ignored that and replied with the above chest beating and denial without any substantiation.\n \n \n \nJudgment is specifically for behavior, and prejudice doesn't apply to behavior insomuch as your application is subjective.\n\n False. There is no definition of the term \"prejudice\" or \"judgment\" which limits their application as you describe.\n Judgment can be applied to non-behavior things as well. If a person shows up to a job interview with a mohawk, that can be \"judged\".\n Prejudice towards behavior? Interracial marriage is clearly a \"behavior\", and yet it obviously experienced prejudice.\n \n \n \nPrejudice is subjective... and applied for no reason.\n\n Those are your personal connotations, ignoring the actual denotations of the word.\n Like I mentioned, you're making up your own definitions...\n \n \n \nYou are living for an age of social acceptance.. therefore openly wage war against that which has universally condemned what you find so impoirtant...\n\n Honestly, I could care less about your \"social acceptance\". You have sufficiently revealed yourself as somebody who has an opinion that I do not lose sleep over.\n There are plenty of other people who condemn me for being gay, while having absolutely no clue as to who I actually am. People judging one another based on just one characteristic is mindless and old as human time itself.\n There is no point in being bothered by people who cannot change due to their own mental deficiencies.\n \n \n \nProblem is... you can't fool genetics and you cannot fool straight people - they aren't buying it.\n\n The genetics of homosexuality has already been demonstrated. You are peeing into the wind on that issue, pretending it's other people who get wet.\n And as for \"fooling straight people\", I have already demonstrated the polls on the issues.\n You ONLY have \"gay marriage\". That's it.\n And your numbers continue to drop over the years.\n \n Whether or not you realize any of that is truly irrelevant to me.\n \n \n \nWe are not bigiots because of the natural reposne we have to homosexual activity - you are bigots because you act against your nature and despise it... you are far closer to the natural definition of bigotry that those who reject your behavior.\n\n Oy Vey! Where to begin?\n 1) Homosexuality IS natural. It's found in many species throughout nature.\n To cut through the inevitable obfuscation, what you're probably doing is trying to substitute \"natural\" in for your own moral judgment of \"good\", but that's a different issue.\n 2) \"bigots cause we act against our nature\"?\n That's nonsensical as well. Just because a person may be inclined to do one thing, and not do that thing, doesn't make him a bigot.\n And that's ignoring the fact that being gay IS a part of the homosexual's nature in the first place.\n \n \n \nMoot argument... and irrelevant, you behavior has nothing to do with someones ethnicity. The fact that you still drag that tried old argument to the surface to defend rank and disgusting behavior is is abject stupidity. The historical record here is the same as it always has been - we reject homosexuality. \n\n Chest Beating.\n Failing to actually address the analogy, but proclaiming to unilaterally reject it without substantiation.\n You would have had just as much substance if you had said \"nuh-uh\".\n \n The black / gay analogy exists because the SAME FLAWED LOGIC that condemned blacks is attempted in application to gays.\n \n \n \nA) As people we learn right from wrong when people act or react to behavior is presented before us. Reinforcement of positive behavior is proof of acceptance of good behavior and rejection of bad behavior is proof of non-acceptable behavior there buddy.. it has always been that way. It's pretty simple, but only figures you don't even get that. \n\n That's a pretty pathetic standard!\n Bigotry towards blacks can provide a \"reinforcement\" of slave behavior, and \"reinforcement\" when the slave works hard.\n That provides absolutely NO moral evaluation of the situation, but rather simply assumes that the status quo is somehow perfect to begin with.\n \n By your standard, NO prejudice would ever change, cause we would all \"learn right from wrong\" by how the previous generation applied it, never questioning the issue.\n I realize that such a situation would be perfect for you, since you can't explain condemnation of homosexuality without abusing the English language and demanding your opinion be assumed as true, but it's just not how the world works.\n \n \n \nB) Homosexual behavior is and will always be rejected behavior for the most common sense reasons. Now, what we don't' know about you - preserves you. What we do know about you may be your own undoing if outside the the societal norms of that culture. Here homosexuality is not healthy nor normal... and has been categorically rejected, but are survived by the grace of those who live and let live. Grace should be sufficient.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n Except your claims are long since outdated.\n Homosexuality is not \"always\" rejected. In fact, like I keep pointing out but you refuse to realize, gays have MAJORITY APPROVAL FOR EQUALITY on all issues with only one exception. Gay marriage is the ONLY exception.\n \n There is nothing \"unhealthy\" about homosexuality.\n \"Normal\" is meaningless. An IQ above 130 is not normal, but definitely desired.\n \n It's like in addition to your own language, you construct your own fantasy to escape the changes that are occuring around you...\n \n \n \nThe \"right\" to freely engage in a deviant sexual proclivity is not yours.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n Yes. It is. Lawrence v Texas clearly demonstrated that right, and it's protected.\n Again, you delude yourself.\n \n \n \nThe fact that you cannot separate you from the sex act is disturbing in itself... we have a word for that - pathological.\n\n The fact that you can't accurately recognize what is REALLY going on here is what is \"pathological\".\n I can define myself by many characteristics. \"Gay\" would be just one of them, and by no means the most important.\n But TO YOU, it's the one YOU fixate on. It's the one that PEOPLE LIKE YOU look to as a SOLE EXCUSE to say \"he can't serve in the military\" or \"he can't adopt\" or \"he's not what we want in this apartment\".\n \n I just want to live my life like everybody else. I don't prance around the office and say \"Did I mention I'm gay\" every five minutes.\n My sexual orientation rarely comes up at the office, unless somebody asks about my spouse or some similar casual chit chat.\n \n But for people like you, that ONE thing is what defines me...\n \n \n \nFor the last time... refrain from trying to drag people of color into dirty little muckfest... your behavior is wrong, not their color.\n\n Really?\n So when I continue with the analogy in the future, you'll not mention your complaint again?\n Naw. Didn't think so.\n \n \n \nMore false claims.\n Just cause a civilization allowed homosexuality and that civilization ended does not mean it ended because of homosexuality.\n In reality, Rome moved towards CHRISTIANITY in its last century, which condemned homosexuality. By your logic, that move should have SAVED the civilization.\n\n \nYes it does... once you grey the lines between morally acceptable and personally acceptable. Their is no morel \"truth\" and the truth became what is right in the eyes of the person doing whatever. When moral clarity collapses - so does society.\n\n Except it DID NOT save the civilization, did it.\n And moreover, can I just say it is hilarious how you proclaim \"their is no morel 'truth' (multiple sic)\" and then you turn around and pretend to give moral truth.\n \n Additionally, I am NOT saying morality is \"what is right in the eyes of the person doing whatever\".\n I believe in some clear boundaries of \"right\" and \"wrong\".\n It is patently absurd how some people go from \"we don't agree on *morality* and *homosexuality*\" to *you believe people should do whatever they want*.\n \n \n \nDon't even go there... there is not logical reason to support bio-illogical behavior. So stop it, if your natural biological disposition doesn't do it enough... gee, what do you need as proof? There is no rational reason for homosexualities existence other than choice. \n\n #1, your reply is a complete nonsequitur.\n I said: \"Like many people who oppose homosexuality without intelligent reasons, you see two things and automatically claim \"cause and effect\" without putting one iota of thought into it.\" I was challenging your assumption that Rome's fall was caused by homosexuality.\n And then you completely fail to justify your claim.\n Moreover, there have been MANY civilizations that have fallen over the course of history. Some people believe that civilizations have some means of \"life\" whereby they either die out or fade to relative obscurity (compared to their previous power).\n What you just did is like saying \"John died cause he was gay\" when in fact John died of old age, just like many other people do...\n \n #2 Rational reason for homsoexual existence?\n As previously discussed in other threads, gays can aid society without contributing to over-population. In times of under-population, gays can help society by assisting in procreation. Gays can serve as a \"safety valve\" to help adopt kids when heterosexuals produce more than they can care for.\n There are plenty of reasons for gay existence.\n \n \n \nThat is not a flip-flop, it is morally consistent. Don't' even think you are displaying anything convincing.\n\n Chest Beating.\n Blind denial while you give NO reason for anybody to believe your position.\n \n To re-state what you didn't address...\n I want people to notice exactly how DR has flipped on his earlier statement.\n He claimed gays have \"protections under the law\", and when I point out we DO NOT have full protection under the law, he quickly turns around AND TRIES TO JUSTIFY the lack of protection under the law.\n I've seen this trick pulled on anti-gay people dozens of times before, and it amazes me how quickly they fall for it.\n They try to pretend we aren't discriminated against, and then when you POINT OUT actual discrimination, they quickly run to JUSTIFY what they claimed didn't exist...\n \n \n \nCompletlely irrelevant.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n You ask me if I know why we have marriage licenses.\n I answer your question, and all you do in reply is say \"irrelevant\" to an answer I gave because YOU ASKED???\n \n \n [quote=DR]You are ignorant of the law... you read what I said. I used other references including marriage.[/quoet]\n You didn't \"reference\" anything.\n Over and over again, your posts REPEATEDLY reference nothing but your opinion.\n You didn't show any \"ignorance\" on my part at all. No evidence that anything I said was wrong.\n Nor do you explain what SPECIFICALLY I said that you think was wrong.\n \n \n \nThose licenses can get revoked on grounds of moral turpitude, marriage is dissolved for the same thing... it's called divorce.\n\n A divorce is granted IF ONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS REQUESTS it.\n And there does not have to be ANY grounds, so saying \"grounds of moral turpitude\" is pointless. A person could get a divorce on \"grounds of moral perfection\" if they wanted to.\n \n \n \nNo... the proof that just shut your mouth mouth is that fact that you have to have a license issued. You do not have a right it is a privileged...\n\n I already disproved this nonsense so I don't know why you're still babbling, other than you love your delusions...\n Loving v Virginia: \"The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.\n \n \n \nbecause not all those who want to get married [straight] have licenses granted.\n\n This is a ridiculous standard.\n Not everybody who wants to buy a gun can.\n Not everybody who wants to vote is allowed.\n Not everybody who wants to walk freely on public property is allowed to.\n \n Rights CAN BE restricted. That doesn't mean they stop being rights.\n Can you name me ANY right which has NO restriction?\n \n \n \nLoving v Virginia: \"The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.\n\n \nand?\n\n I prove that marriage is a right in the U.S., and DR can't even recognize he has been proven wrong...\n Amazing!",

Koenig 1 , Matt McGue 1 , Robert F. Krueger 1 and Thomas J. Bouchard, Jr. 1 \n \n \n Abstract\n Estimates of the degree of genetic and environmental influences on religiousness have varied widely. This variation may, in part, be due to age differences in the samples under study. To investigate the heritability of religiousness and possible age changes in this estimate, both current and retrospective religiousness were assessed by self-report in a sample of adult male twins (169 MZ pairs and 104 DZ pairs, mean age of 33 years). Retrospective reports of religiousness showed little correlation difference between MZ (r=.69) and DZ (r=.59) twins. Reports of current religiousness, however, did show larger MZ (r=.62) than DZ (r=.42) similarity. Biometric analysis of the two religiousness ratings revealed that genetic factors were significantly weaker (12% vs. 44%) and shared environmental factors were significantly stronger (56% vs. 18%) in adolescence compared to adulthood. Analysis of internal and external religiousness subscales of the total score revealed similar results. These findings support the hypothesis that the heritability of religiousness increases from adolescence to adulthood.\n",

Fraternal, or \"dizygotic\", twins happen when Mom releases two eggs (either at the same or different times during her cycle), and different sperm fertilize each egg. Fraternal twins share up to 50% of their genes, and are no more alike or different than any two siblings would be. The similarity between fraternal twins can be close to identical - there are many fraternal twins that look identical - even more identical than some identical twins!\n The difference between fraternal and identical twins is that fraternal twins are two separate eggs fertilized by two separate sperm to form two separate embryos and then make two separate babies. Identical twins are formed when one fertilized egg divides into two separate embryos to make two babies.Facts About Fraternal Twins",

   "Genes contribute to religious inclination - 16 March 2005 - New Scientist\n\n \n When you can find me the \"Christian\" gene that compels people to worship Jesus, I'll take your views seriously! Or even a twin effect.\n \n It is true that some scholars have suggested that religiosity, or the propensity to experience religious faith, is genetically or biologically influenced. Drugs do affect this, and certain kinds of physical or mental trauma can also result in hyper-religiosity. So I am happy to accept that our willingness to abandon our reason to unsubstantiated faith may have a biological component, though thankfully, most of us aren't in thrall to it.\n \n However, any analogy between the evidenced biology of sexual orientation and the alleged biology of believing in miracles and people who rise from the dead is stretched. I am biologically compelled through my sexual orientation to pick men rather than women as prospective life or sexual partners -- when I have a free choice not punished by social or religious bigotry. I am not biologically compelled to pick Jesus over Buddha, and intellectually, I'd plump for Buddha any day. \n \n Sorry, but while religiosity may have a biological basis in our psyche -- again, thankfully not all of us are handicapped by this burden -- it is far more an intellectual or emotional choice. You do get religious converts quite frequently: converts by sexual orientation are few and far between, if they exist at all.",

Yet that trait of real reason is the opposite of what we see here by so many of these so-called 'reason' advocates.\n\n \n That's a pretty uinreasonable rant. I do wish religious believers were more prone to using reason. Then they wouldn't get bent all out of shape at the prospect of equal rights for gay people.\n \n As it is, I can only judge religious believers by their actions. Whenever they oppose the legitimate aspirations of gay human beings, they abandon reason for religious zeal. Then they are offended when they are justly criticised for being unreasonable!\n \n \nOften these so-called adherents to reason appeal to the enlightenment, as if their attitudes and approaches have anything in common with most of the religion-tolerant giants of the enlightenment. These giants ... Locke, Bacon, Franklin, Jefferson, Hume, even Voltaire ... while unapologetic in their disabelief over religion when it applied, were not about the business of constantly belittling it or demonstrating intolerance toward it. They were willing to live side-by-side with it and accepted it as part of the marketplace of discourse and ideas, nonetheless. Anti-theists would never do that, without kicking and screaming, anyway.\n\n \n O spare us the self-righteous breast-beating. We atheists are perfectly happy to live alongside deists and theists, if only those theists were perfectly happy to live alongside us. But no, they carp, criticise and complain incessantly, then criticise us when we defend ourselves against their bullying.\n \n \nAnd most of those enlightenment examples don't even include all the religious scientists, like Newton, Kepler, Boyle, Faraday, etc. who are great examples that religion and reason are hardly juxtaposed concepts, certainly not somehow inversely proportional as some of the more virulent 'reason' adherents would portend. There are only two sorts of people for which religion and reason can't co-exist: religious fundies and anti-theist-fundies, and so fundamentalist anti-theists are in the same category as religious fundamentalism. They're of the same grimy cloth. Intolerance is still intolerance, even if it tries to dress itself up and attempt to invoke the term 'reason.'\n \n Pfft. 'Reason', my rump. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n Religious believers do not use reason to justify their beliefs. They use faith. Faith is by definition the absence of reason. That puts you in the same boat as the religious fundies, and not in the one with the scientists of the Enlightenment.\n \n Criticism is NOT intolerance, my intolerant friend. You would be wise to learn the difference. Intolerance is the father and mother of attempts to curtail the legitimate rights of gay people. Whenever you oppose marriage for gays, under the guise of some arcane religious excuse, you express your intolerance of gay people. We can all see it. Why can't you?\n \n :xbanghead",

Typically watering down what they are doing themselves (and I speak not of gays, but THEM), but playing up in worst possible terms the people they oppose.

I understand what you're saying, but I think you'd be wise to not go by the likes of the few virulent posters here in the way you see gays, Arch. Most gay people are good people; they aren't out to be belligerent and pick fights, constantly accuse others of what they're consistently guilty of themselves, nor are they out to say bad things about religion when they can. I think most are more willing to accept religion around them, even when it disagrees with them. (As most people understand that not everyone is going to agree with them!) Keep in mind that some of these are the fringe folk of the gay rights movement here. Just as forums like this sometimes attract the more far ideologies of religion or other ideologies. Forums present an outlet for the more fringe ideologues, and it's easy to forget that most people aren't like that. IOW, I think some of this dogged argumentativeness and contemptuousness on display here is indicative of how some of these folks aren't like most people (including gays). If you had Fred Phelps or Jerry Falwell in a room trying to discuss something with them, they too could easily give someone a wrong impression of, say, Christians. \n \n Look, there's no sound basis to refuse benefits to people just because they are gay, and giving benefits to them is the compassionate thing to do. Refusing to mistreat them and opposing discrimination against people is a compassionate thing. The only disagreement I have is in terms of redefining marriage; there'd be no issue to me otherwise. I don't agree with your approach of calling them 'evil' and some of the other things you've called them. That's not Christian compassion, Archie. no offense, but I think there are times you've demonstrated virulence too. I also don't agree with you that this is a case of \"supporting evil.\" Gay people who marry are not \"evil.\" It's just something I disagree with constitutionally. My religion is a personal one; what people choose to do with their life is their business. I've go no interest in condemning people, and if that's what you call 'compromise', then so be it.",

   "First, faith:\n A definition from Merriam Webster.\n firm belief in something for which there is no proof\n Notice, the word isn't \"some\" proof, but rather NO proof.\n Reason provides SOME level of proof.\n Religion (and faith) relies on \"no proof\".\n\n \n There are several gaping holes in the application of that definition to this context.\n \n - Why should anyone accept that reason requires \"proof\" to qualify as \"reason\"? Why is merely EVIDENCE not sufficient to qualify?\n \n - What constitutes both \"proof\" AND \"evidence\" depends on the standard for any given person. It's not like there's a central committee out there that determines what evidence or proof IS valid to constitute evidence and proof. For the theist, nature (for instance) points to the existence of God. For the atheist, it points to the non-existence of God. \n \n And for that matter, if a person weighs the evidence as he or she sees it, and comes to the conclusion that it's God that was behind it, how is that not using reason?? It's not like there aren't billions who believe in God, and therefore to think that the numbers of those who came to conclusions based on evidence are not significant is unrealistic.\n \n - Finally, if something isn't even a proof-related issue to begin with, why should this apply? Because that IS where faith most often comes into play. The very REASON faith has to deal with things is because they are often areas proof can't even be provided in the first place. For instance, in regards to the existence of God, it's not that there's \"no proof\" of it, or proof that God doesn't exist. It's that it's not a provable issue, to begin with. It CAN'T be proven OR disproven. It's not an issue in the realm of the empirical to begin with.\n \n \nIf I have a reason to believe the sun will rise in the east, it isn't \"faith\" that it will do so.\n\n \n But that's an issue that is of the empirical type, to begin with. It's an issue for which measurements, light, telescopes, etc. can give us quantifiable information. How are you going to get quantifiable information concerning the existence of God? How will you measure that? Or the belief that any spiritual being exists? You see, those are issues that are addressed by faith because they are not reason-based issues. Now it's true that at one time, some considered the rising of the sun a spiritual issue. But it's a different sort of issue than believing God exists--a belief that comes about due to religious experience the world over. You just refuse to accept the idea of their experience to begin with because you can't measure them as events. (And such experiences are why the belief in God is a different sort of issue than the examples given like \"tooth fairies\", \"unicorns\", or whatever other known mythological examples are given to try and associate belief in God with what most of humanity considered imaginary. People aren't having religious experiences with tooth fairies or unicorns, after all.) \n \n \nWhile Jyoshu may not like it, that is THE NATURE of \"faith\".\n\n \n While Foundit may not like it, none of this means faith is defined as a lack of reason, for the reasons I've just given. \n \n \nThat's how things like \"Thou shalt not work on the Sabbaoth\" or \"slavery\" or \"genocide\" or \"misogyny\" get phased out. REASON EVENTUALLY trumping \"religion\".\n 'Nuff said...\n\n \n Er, hate to tell you this, but in point of fact those are all cases where RELIGION trumped religion. Read your Bible. Christ taught against the idea that being legalistic about working on the sabbath is wrong. Christ ... the religious figure. And he taught about loving our enemies and emphasized adherence to an elevated form of the reciprocity ethic, which would not allow for enslaving them or commiting genocide, or being misogynistic.\n \n Now you will probably try and make the case that these teachings of Christ WERE examples of reason, but I'm not arguing they weren't. This point in fact only helps make MY case, which is that faith/religion doesn't mean lack of reason. In these cases, it incorporated reason. It held a cooperative relationship with it. \n \n \nI ask you to prove a claim of yours. You ignore me.\n \n (P.S. Didn't I say earlier that Jyoshu WOULD try to respond back to me when he thought he had some point he could win... emoticon_ic\n His passive-aggressive tactics are just that. Tactics.\n A means of trying to pretend he isn't running from a conversation he clearly lost...)\n\n \n Foundit, the ONLY reason I chose to cease the earlier exchange is because you became extremely hostile, as you often do. I made that clear. It's one reason Steeeeve abandoned you, and the reason Phyllis pointed out your hostility in another thread. I also don't view this as you seem to do--according to your comments--as something to \"win\" or lose as if it were a football game; it's a conversation as far as I'm concerned. Regarding getting responses, if you act in a friendly, civil manner, and willing to accept points I'm making that may not be in direct narrow-according-to-what-you-demand responses to what you're saying, you'll get more responses--perhaps from others too. It's a rather natural thing. And it's entirely up to you. I'm more than HAPPY to respond to you and carry on a conversation with you if you are non-hostile and friendly in the process. Keep it above the fray, and I'll be glad to converse. Don't do so, and I'm not interested--you will indeed be ignored. You name it ... This post was more even keeled and not hostile by the terms I've mentioned, so I'm responding.\n \n Now, what claim, specifically, did you want proof for? I'm not going to read back through the hostile posts of earlier; would you please repeat what it is you want proof for?\n \n \nBut to substantiate my point, I think your attempt to pretend that the Castro group running the Christians out of the Castro was somehow equivalent of \"gay rights groups\" is a perfect example. emoticon_xgood\n\n \n How is that \"bashing gays\"? What did I say that \"bashed\" them, exactly, Foundit?",

   "Wow. Well, there you have it--prejudice (and arrogance, to say that about a scientist such as Newton) on display.\n \n \n Ala, it's true. Newton, for all his brilliance, was handicapped by his religious obsessions. He spent more time on those and alchemy than he did on maths and physics.\n \n \nNo it's not. The idea that one means the lack of another is fallacious. That's because reason and faith deal with different realms of emphasis. (And just because each unfortunately crosses into the other from time to time doesn't disprove this, either.) You have a rather unrealistic black and white view of things, that (thank goodness) isn't the way most people are. How does belief in God, for instance, indicate a lack of reason, when reason can't address whether God exists or doesn't exist in terms of proof? Faith deals in things reason can't handle, and reason deals in things faith can't handle. It's actually a, er, reasonable arrangement. :) The only way one could think faith equates to lack of reason would be if you are prejudiced toward it (and therefore those who use faith). \n \n \n Nope. Reason would simply acknowledge that there are gaps in our knowledge, and that there probably always will be. It's faith, faith like yours, for example, that populates those gaps with mythical inventions.\n \n \nI'd love for Foundit to back up this claim and show where I'm \"bashing gays\", FWIW. These sort of claims are flat-out tactically hyperbolic, and is the sort of disingenuous approach a religious fundie would use.\n\n \n I think your attitudes towards gay people are reflected in the tone of your posts. You never miss an opportunity to attack gay activists with smug self-satisfaction when they occasionally do something foolish, as all people occasionally do. You take an unwholesome -- and may I say, unchristian -- glee in it. :)",

   "There are several gaping holes in the application of that definition to this context.\n - Why should anyone accept that reason requires \"proof\" to qualify as \"reason\"? Why is merely EVIDENCE not sufficient to qualify?\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n I have no idea what you think you just said.\n \"Reason\" is one example of \"evidence\" or \"proof\".\n If I were to argue that X+Y=Z, and I gave the logical reason sequence justifying my claim, that would be \"evidence\" or \"proof\".\n \n \n \n- What constitutes both \"proof\" AND \"evidence\" depends on the standard for any given person. It's not like there's a central committee out there that determines what evidence or proof IS valid to constitute evidence and proof. For the theist, nature (for instance) points to the existence of God. For the atheist, it points to the non-existence of God.\n\n No.\n You're claiming that the SAME ITEM (i.e. nature) can both provide evidence FOR and AGAINST God?\n The logical person would realize that the item in question is NOT REALLY proof then in the first place.\n \n Suppose Mary went to a court of law and got in the witness stand, and then held up a stick of carrot as proof for why James couldn't have committed the assault?\n Would that make any sense?\n \n A lack of REASON is involved in your example.\n The theist and the atheist use that as part of their FAITH, but it's not really \"proof\" of anything.\n \n \n \nAnd for that matter, if a person weighs the evidence as he or she sees it, and comes to the conclusion that it's God that was behind it, how is that not using reason??\n\n emoticon_wow\n So by your logic, Mary would be said to have used \"reason\" in her defense of James???\n No.\n \n Part of the problem is that some people have so INCREDIBLY LITTLE regard for \"reason\" and \"science\" that they think that what they do somehow magically qualifies when it just plain does not.\n Mary is not using \"reason\" to say that the stick of carrot proves James is innocent. She's using FAITH.\n \n \n \nIt's not like there aren't billions who believe in God, and therefore to think that the numbers of those who came to conclusions based on evidence are not significant is unrealistic.\n\n And a lot of people believed that the earth was flat.\n The historical number of people who supported inequality and misogyny of women dramatically dwarfs those who actually support equality of women.\n \n What people \"believe\" doesn't provide proof of anything.\n Quite frankly, THAT would be more apt to go back to those \"genetic\" links you were tossing out there without any attempt at an explanation as to what you thought you were doing...\n \n \n \n- Finally, if something isn't even a proof-related issue to begin with, why should this apply? Because that IS where faith most often comes into play.\n\n emoticon_wow\n I was simply trying to explain how \"reason\" and \"faith\" were mutually exclusive.\n This should be a no-brainer analysis.\n It's not meant to show disdain for anything, but rather just to accurately categorize things.\n \n \n \nThe very REASON faith has to deal with things is because they are often areas proof can't even be provided in the first place.\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n Over 5,000 years ago, people were talking about the age of earth.\n What is wrong with just saying \"I don't know\"?\n Cause that would have been THE TRUTH!\n Instead, the Judeo-Christian religion put out a false statement as a \"faith\".\n And today, EVEN THOUGH REASON PROVIDES proof, \"faith\" freaks out and can't handle it.\n \n I can understand your statement on a SMALL number of statements. Like if a woman is in financial trouble and she doesn't know if she can make it, \"faith\" can help her to believe that she will live to see a better day.\n But that is only helpful if she WORKS to that better day.\n With \"faith\", too often it starts getting jealous because \"science\" starts analyzing HOW the better day can come...\n \n \n \nFor instance, in regards to the existence of God, it's not that there's \"no proof\" of it, or proof that God doesn't exist. It's that it's not a provable issue, to begin with. It CAN'T be proven OR disproven. It's not an issue in the realm of the empirical to begin with.\n\n Why is that question of any REAL importance in the first place?\n Is it because some have created stories of how not believing as they proclaim can cause you future harm, because you didn't worship a being who was going to torture you forever if you didn't?\n \n \n \nBut that's an issue that is of the empirical type, to begin with.\n\n Yes. It is.\n And whether or not homosexuality \"harms\" society is another empirical question, but that doesn't stop \"religion\" from making up all sorts of lies about the situation. Or \"BLOWI\" if you prefer to label it as such...\n \n Part of the problem is that RELIGION KEEPS STICKING ITS NOSE where it doesn't belong.\n And when religion GETS IT WRONG, it hampers advancement of society.\n Like with slavery, genocide, and misogyny, the \"bible says so\" kept these ideas going for CENTURIES.\n And on the issue of \"gay rights\", religion is ALSO sticking its nose where it doesn't belong.\n Now I'm not trying to say that a religious person can't do what they want IN THEIR OWN LIFE. That's their prerogative.\n But when it comes to civilized society recognizing equality and practicing it, religion is once again getting in the way...\n \n \n \nHow are you going to get quantifiable information concerning the existence of God?\n\n Why do I care?\n \n \n \nYou see, those are issues that are addressed by faith because they are not reason-based issues.\n\n See, right there you recognize a dividing line between religion and reason. How they ARE DIFFERENT.\n Now for the bonus round.\n \n 1) Can you get that we have NO CONFLICT on the existence of this dividing line?\n 2) Can you get that the dividing line is TWO WAY?\n Can you get the fact that while \"faith\" is applied to non-reason issues, that also \"reason\" is not applied when the issue is faith-based?\n If \"reason\" were applicable, it wouldn't be just \"faith\" anymore...\n \n \n \nWhile Foundit may not like it, none of this means faith is defined as a lack of reason, for the reasons I've just given. \n\n I quote this only because it answers my item #2 above.\n I welcome people to compare the last two quoted items from Jyoshu.\n He gets that \"reason\" is not applied to \"faith\" issues.\n But he doesn't recognize the converse of that statement as ALSO being true...\n \n \n \nEr, hate to tell you this, but in point of fact those are all cases where RELIGION trumped religion. Read your Bible. Christ taught against the idea that being legalistic about working on the sabbath is wrong. Christ ... the religious figure.\n\n I've read the excuse Christians try to use on that issue. It's nonsense.\n Jesus got busted for breaking the law. A law the bible claimed he would keep PERFECTLY.\n But instead of keeping it perfectly, he just said \"it doesn't apply\" when it got inconvenient.\n \n I believe we have already discussed that issue, and we can do so again if you like, but Jesus was giving excuses for a standard that GOD HIMSELF put into practice. GOD HIMSELF gave the legal precedent with Moses and the manna from heaven, where God established that gathering the manna on the sabbaoth was still a violation.\n \n \n \nAnd he taught about loving our enemies and emphasized adherence to an elevated form of the reciprocity ethic, which would not allow for enslaving them or commiting genocide, or being misogynistic.\n\n No.\n Slavery was practiced all around Jesus, but he NEVER condemned it.\n Misogyny is endorsed in the bible all over the place. New and Old Testament.\n \n This \"approach\" of yours is typically how Christians try to weasel around what their bible says. They find some way to find a \"new\" interpretation that supports their philosophy change, and then they abandon the old and explicitly written in favor of what they KNOW is better.\n Not because the bible TOLD them to do it this way, but rather IGNORING what the bible EXPLICITLY explains, to do it the other way.\n \n Something similar is happening with gays. Eventually Christianity will adapt or die on the issue. It cannot sustain the level of animosity it has shown towards gays and survive. Not when the youth are increasingly recognizing that animosity as something they will have no part of.\n \n But while I recognize an end in sight, I also realize the REAL mechanism at work...\n \n \n \nNow you will probably try and make the case that these teachings of Christ WERE examples of reason, but I'm not arguing they weren't. This point in fact only helps make MY case, which is that faith/religion doesn't mean lack of reason. In these cases, it incorporated reason. It held a cooperative relationship with it.\n\n No.\n Faith tells people what to do. It told common sense to go sit in the corner and shut up cause women were supposed to be restricted. The bible EXPLICITLY states that.\n Reason filtered into the SITUATION, and in spite of faith blindly following what it is told to do, people began to realize that they WERE BLIND with faith.\n They don't have a \"cooperative\" relationship.\n Only one concept can win out there.\n \n \"Apologetics\" is not \"reason\", but rather a fanciful explanation from Mary as to why the carrot had to mean that James COULDn'T have done it...\n \n \n \nFoundit, the ONLY reason I chose to cease the earlier exchange is because you became extremely hostile, as you often do. I made that clear.\n\n You made your excuse clear. That much is true.\n But over and over again, you make some of the most ABSURD excuses for what you claim is \"hostile\".\n In one thread, I pointed out how many posts you make and you cried like a stuck pig.\n I would STILL love to drag you back to that nonsensical excuse you made (I think it was one of the best examples of your passive-aggressive attempts), but you have habitually refused.\n OVER and OVER again when I try to challenge you on whether or not what you CLAIM is an \"insult\" is actually an insult, you refuse.\n \n \n \nIt's one reason Steeeeve abandoned you, and the reason Phyllis pointed out your hostility in another thread. I also don't view this as you seem to do--according to your comments--as something to \"win\" or lose as if it were a football game; it's a conversation as far as I'm concerned.\n\n Steeeeve abandoned me cause he couldn't take me pointing out his strawman.\n I POINT-BLANK CHALLENGED HIM to a moderated debate, whereby we would have a moderator restrict any \"insults\" that the moderator saw from me, BUT ALSO STEEEEVE's strawman arguments would be curbed.\n Steeeeve chickened out.\n And then Steeeeve showed his TRUE colors by continually bringing me up and DIRECTLY INSULTING ME, but of course YOU had ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM with Steeeeve making inexcusable attacks against me.\n You joined him and stated that you thought I should be banned!\n \n So whether you want to admit it or not, you and Steeeeve are JUST AS MUCH A PART of this.\n \n And furthermore Jyoshu, how many people have \"abandoned\" discussions with you over the years? On this message board, and others? emoticon_ic\n \n \n \nNow, what claim, specifically, did you want proof for? I'm not going to read back through the hostile posts of earlier; would you please repeat what it is you want proof for?\n\n emoticon_wow\n I REPEATED THE REQUEST in that very post you responded to earlier.\n It was RIGHT THERE, and you want me to repeat it... emoticon_xdonno\n I mean, you HAD TO CUT IT OUT of your earlier post in order to post what you said earlier, but now you are acting like you don't know what I'm talking about.\n \n Here it is. For the third time now...\n jyoshu: It's interesting how Lesz and Foundit re-represent intolerance as 'criticism' isn't it?\n foundit66: Can you explain (please quote what you're referring to) what we are doing that is ACTUALLY intolerant, and not just criticism?\n \n \n \nHow is that \"bashing gays\"? What did I say that \"bashed\" them, exactly, Foundit?\n\n I've answered your question, which I did for the benefit of others.\n If you actually answer my challenge issued earlier, and repeated for the third time above, I'll consider entertaining your redundant queries.\n But only with quid pro quo.",

   "\"Reason\" is one example of \"evidence\" or \"proof\".\n If I were to argue that X+Y=Z, and I gave the logical reason sequence justifying my claim, that would be \"evidence\" or \"proof\".\n\n \n Come on. You know very well that not all areas of evidence are that cut and dry. You used a slam-dunk evidence = proof example and that only applies in such situations as mathematics. Because not all issues of evidence are like a math problem where EVERYONE will agree that the correct answer is a certain thing, because there are set rules in place for mathematics. The I see evidence that a given historical battle was fought primarily with spears, then other evidence that it was fought primarily with swords, there's no slam dunk answer there. THAT'S the sort of issue that religion often has to get into, and people have to be able to (personally at least) use religious experience as their evidence. Your example is an over-simplification. Evidence and proof are not the same concept, necessarily, but REASON can be about evidence rather than slam-dunk proof. That's the point I was making. \n \n \nYou're claiming that the SAME ITEM (i.e. nature) can both provide evidence FOR and AGAINST God?\n\n \n Foundit, you're missing a critical component here .... evidence is in the eye of the beholder. There's no central committee that determines which evidence is valid. Many religious people find there's PLENTY of evidence to show that God exists. You just reject out of hand their evidence.\n \n \nPart of the problem is that some people have so INCREDIBLY LITTLE regard for \"reason\" and \"science\" that they think that what they do somehow magically qualifies when it just plain does not.\n\n \n So who gets to decide what evidence qualifies as valid?\n \n \nAnd a lot of people believed that the earth was flat.\n \n The historical number of people who supported inequality and misogyny of women dramatically dwarfs those who actually support equality of women.\n\n \n See, you're conflating an issue for which observation gives proof with a subjective sociological issue. It's much harder to determine the line someone crosses where a given behavior turns into bona fide misogyny. This is a tactic I see all the time by those who argue a given side of controversial social issues. You can no more compare gay-related or gender-related issues to determining the shape of the earth than you could someone's opinion on Religion's stance on controversial SOCIAL issues is of a much different type than, say, it's insistence at one time to the Ptolemaic model of the universe. One is a distinctly MORAL issue. The other is a distinctly scientific one. One can easily be proven or disproven by mere observation (with the right equipment anyway). The other is a point-of-view issue that falls under the category of subjectivism. It's like taking a.) that stealing is wrong, b.) the speed of light ... and comparing them. They are separate types of issues entirely, and it makes for a good example of religion/faith dealing with an issue for which reason can't adequately deal with either. Reason can deal just fine with the speed of light, which is determinable by observation. It can't deal with saying behavior X is immoral (a subjective question), particularly if it's a grey area issue. \n \n \nemoticon_wow\n I was simply trying to explain how \"reason\" and \"faith\" were mutually exclusive.\n This should be a no-brainer analysis.\n It's not meant to show disdain for anything, but rather just to accurately categorize things.\n\n \n Foundit, I'm not saying they aren't mutually exclusive--frankly, I think you're wasting a lot of attention here on something no one is arguing. The claim made that I took issue with was that faith equates to LACK OF REASON, not that they aren't mutually exclusive. \n \n \nOver 5,000 years ago, people were talking about the age of earth. What is wrong with just saying \"I don't know\"?\n\n \n Again, two different kinds of issues.\n \n THAT'S an issue where religion did intrude on something verifiable with observation. Unless you can observe God, you can't verify IT. Or moral questions. One is a reason-based issue. Others are not. \n \n With \"faith\", too often it starts getting jealous because \"science\" starts analyzing HOW the better day can come...\n \n Well, faith isn't some sentient entity that could experience an emotion. It's just a way of approaching some things. I suppose it's possible there has been \"jealousy\" at times toward reason, but that's only in cases where religion was trying to explain an issue verifiable via observation. Frankly, I'd chalk up the slowness to come around on scientific issues--like what Galileo was doing, for instance---to human nature and people's natural aversion to change. We see this sort of thing in the scientific community sometimes too.\n \n \nWhy is that question of any REAL importance in the first place?\n Is it because some have created stories of how not believing as they proclaim can cause you future harm, because you didn't worship a being who was going to torture you forever if you didn't?\n\n \n Huh? emoticon_confused Whether or not God exists? If I see things that indicate to me a creator or see the work of a being in my life that's just way too much to be coincidence, there comes a point one has to come to a conclusion that something is there. It makes no difference what the \"importance\" of the question is. I'd be ignoring the obvious to me if I pretended there wasn't something there.\n \n \nAnd whether or not homosexuality \"harms\" society is another empirical question,\n\n \n But not whether morality should be based only on whether something is harmful ...\n \n \nPart of the problem is that RELIGION KEEPS STICKING ITS NOSE where it doesn't belong.\n\n \n Yes, I already said problems come into play when one crosses over into the other. That doesn't mean they aren't mutually exclusive concepts. Reason sticks it's nose into religion TOO, when it starts trying to concern itself with religious-only questions and trying to make people question faith for no good reason. It's never going to prove or disprove the existence of God, or prove/disprove the historical Jesus, for instance.\n \n \nAnd on the issue of \"gay rights\", religion is ALSO sticking its nose where it doesn't belong.\n Now I'm not trying to say that a religious person can't do what they want IN THEIR OWN LIFE. That's their prerogative.\n But when it comes to civilized society recognizing equality and practicing it, religion is once again getting in the way...\n\n \n And at that point, you beg the question. That's much of the WHOLE gay-related-issue debate, after all--whether or not gay-related issues--or more importantly--morality as it pertains to such issues--fall under such a category. I agree with you that churches have stuck their nose into issues they shouldn't. But I think often what people such as yourself react to as churches going too far is often just people speaking about their moral beliefs. The only way people could just \"keep that belief in their own life\" without influencing anyone is to make it a point to do it only in secret. A secret belief. And that's unrealistic and overly restrictive toward religious people. The issue politics in churches and the issue of being open to share their beliefs are not the same thing necessarily, and yet here you don't seem to be limiting your stance against religion only toward the former--politics in churches. If I knew you were satisfied by the stopping of only churches engaging in OFFICIAL sanctioning of political issues or support of candidates as an organization or pastors in pulpits, that would be fine. But I think you know that if religious people are going to be allowed to speak their mind in public (and they have to be), then this isn't going to go away.\n \n (Incidentally, I thought gay marriage wasn't supposed to be a \"political\" issue, according to some who defend it. But the basis for which prop 8 opposers are opposing Mormons is that they were engaging in politics as a church.) \n \n \nSee, right there you recognize a dividing line between religion and reason. How they ARE DIFFERENT.\n Now for the bonus round.\n\n \n Of course I recognize that 'dividing line.' Again, this is something we haven't disagreed on here.\n \n \nCan you get the fact that while \"faith\" is applied to non-reason issues, that also \"reason\" is not applied when the issue is faith-based?\n If \"reason\" were applicable, it wouldn't be just \"faith\" anymore...\n\n \n No, because there are issues for which reason can't reall deal with. It's a completely moot point to be even speaking in terms of reason being able to apply toward knowing some things. \n \n \n \nI've read the excuse Christians try to use on that issue. It's nonsense.\n\n \n Er ... it's what Jesus said. Not an excuse Christians are using ... emoticon_confused\n \n \nI believe we have already discussed that issue, and we can do so again if you like, but Jesus was giving excuses for a standard that GOD HIMSELF put into practice. GOD HIMSELF gave the legal precedent with Moses and the manna from heaven, where God established that gathering the manna on the sabbaoth was still a violation.\n\n \n In Christianity, when Jesus says something, it IS God speaking. You might as well be saying God clarified what he meant. (Though I think you'll call it \"making excuses\" because that's more negative.)\n \n \nThis \"approach\" of yours is typically how Christians try to weasel around what their bible says. They find some way to find a \"new\" interpretation that supports their philosophy change, and then they abandon the old and explicitly written in favor of what they KNOW is better.\n Not because the bible TOLD them to do it this way, but rather IGNORING what the bible EXPLICITLY explains, to do it the other way.\n\n \n Again, it's fascinating how critics of religious people hold them to a more legalistic standard than religious people THEMSELVES often hold to. The WHOLE point of Jesus elaborating to saying \"love God and love your neighbor\" and love your enemies, etc. was so that people CAN use their brains (reason!!) in terms of the OT law. He's pointing out basic stuff, freeing them from legalism. That much is obvious.\n \n \nThey don't have a \"cooperative\" relationship.\n Only one concept can win out there.\n\n \n No. The existence of religious scientists proves that wrong. That's modern intolerance of faith talking on your part, not a genuine recognition of reality which often plays out differently.\n \n \nYou made your excuse clear. That much is true.\n But over and over again, you make some of the most ABSURD excuses for what you claim is \"hostile\".\n In one thread, I pointed out how many posts you make and you cried like a stuck pig.\n\n \n And there you go again. There is absolutely NO reason for that sort of rhetoric \"cried like a stuck pig.\" Why can't you just have a conversation? A straight, basic, friendly conversation without things like that? Is it really asking so much?\n \n \njyoshu: It's interesting how Lesz and Foundit re-represent intolerance as 'criticism' isn't it?\n foundit66: Can you explain (please quote what you're referring to) what we are doing that is ACTUALLY intolerant, and not just criticism?\n \n\n \n Since you ask, when Lesz says he's against Christianity or religion, he's not taking into account that the real problems are SOME in the religion. IMO that's a form of intolerance. it's like someone saying \"I'm against gays\" because of the actions of the gays in Castro. \n \n When you demand Christians criticize Christians, but don't, for instance, demand that gays criticize gays, IMO it reveals intolerance and prejudice on your part. Christians should no more have to spend time calling down other Christians that they really don't have much in common with than other gays should spend time calling down other gays. \n \n When you misrepresent Christians going by what Jesus says as \"making excuses\", you are revealing an intolerance. A give-them-no-benefit-of-the-doubt approach. Biased to begin with.\n \n \nI've answered your question, which I did for the benefit of others. If you actually answer my challenge issued earlier, and repeated for the third time above, I'll consider entertaining your redundant queries.\n\n \n And I answered yours (mainly for the benefit of others as well).",

   "Fraternal twins are not 50% genetically identical. The article is wrong.\n \n Fraternal twins are twins that were born at the same time to the same mother, but in fact are two different eggs fertilized by two different sperm. Identical twins, however, are born when one egg is fertilized by one sperm, but two embryos develop. On the surface it seems logical that two fraternal embryos would be 50% genetically identical, but eggs and sperm do not separate genetic material into \"Set A\" and \"Set B\". There are infinite numbers of combinations of genes that two people can produce and fraternal twins are no more or less genetically identical than normal siblings. If we all divided our genetic material the same way in every egg/sperm we produce, each pair of people would only be able to produce 4 combinations.\n \n In short, the results of the questionnaire are based on a flawed premise and are therefore inconclusive.\n\n \n Great. You should have linked to the member who posted the link then. All I did was discuss the content.\n \n \nGenes contribute to religious inclination - 16 March 2005 - New Scientist\n\n \n And I also commented on your concern also.\n \n \nNot sure what part of \"deliberately obtuse\" and \"mocking\" you don't understand. And what is an identical fraternal twin?\n\n \n Regarding the bolded, I don't know. I always thought that fraternal twins couldn't have identical DNA.

   "Come on. You know very well that not all areas of evidence are that cut and dry.\n\n I'm sorry, but your example gave \"evidence\" that works just as well for the \"pro\" as the \"anti\" side.\n That's not \"evidence\".\n It's a difference in how people interpret facts. The fact that it can apply just as well EITHER way should show it's not really \"evidence\" at all.\n It's like John seeing a red car in a garage, and saying \"That shows that there is a God\".\n Mark sees the same red car in the same garage, and says \"That shows there is no God\".\n The rational conclusion out of all this is that the red car doesn't mean ANYTHING conclusive about the existence or absence of God.\n \n \n \nYou used a slam-dunk evidence = proof example and that only applies in such situations as mathematics. Because not all issues of evidence are like a math problem where EVERYONE will agree that the correct answer is a certain thing, because there are set rules in place for mathematics.\n\n Not \"everyone\" will agree, but when there is NO VALID DISCERNING MECHANISM for determining the superiority or inferiority of one approach / interpretation over another, THAT shows that it's not even really \"proof\" in the first place.\n \n \n \nThe I see evidence that a given historical battle was fought primarily with spears, then other evidence that it was fought primarily with swords, there's no slam dunk answer there.\n\n See what you just did?\n You just changed the \"evidence\" to two SEPARATE pieces of evidence. NOT the same piece of \"evidence\" that doesn't REALLY show any \"evidence\" at all.\n And I'm not saying that \"evidence\" is always conclusive and definitive.\n My point was over what evidence WAS NOT, like \"nature\" IS NOT \"evidence\" of the existence or absence of God. Such a belief is as valid as reading chicken bones or saying a \"rorschach\" is somehow \"evidence\".\n The rorschach provides information about the person MAKING THE CLAIM, which is similar to what is going on in your original analogy.\n \n \n \nTHAT'S the sort of issue that religion often has to get into, and people have to be able to (personally at least) use religious experience as their evidence.\n\n Why?\n There is no \"have to be able to\" about this.\n You WANT to say that \"religious experiences\" have evidence, but the truth is that it's just interpreting chicken bones or rorschach tests.\n The REAL thing going on is \"evidence\" (or information) about the person MAKING the claim.\n \n \n \nEvidence and proof are not the same concept, necessarily, but REASON can be about evidence rather than slam-dunk proof. That's the point I was making.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n Let's look at your statement there. \"Evidence and proof are not the same concept, necessarily, but REASON can be about evidence rather than slam-dunk proof.\".\n If that HAD been \"the point you were making\", I probably wouldn't have responded.\n Anybody can look at your claim and realize that it clearly was NOT the real \"point\" by simply observing that your sentence includes absolutely NO MENTION of religion.\n This whole discussion was about RELIGION and FAITH's role in \"reason\" and \"evidence\".\n \n And now you try to uproot the goalposts...\n \n \n \nFoundit, you're missing a critical component here .... evidence is in the eye of the beholder. There's no central committee that determines which evidence is valid. Many religious people find there's PLENTY of evidence to show that God exists. You just reject out of hand their evidence.\n\n Rorschach and chicken bone readings are not \"evidence\".\n It's people looking at things and seeing things that they WANT to see there.\n \n REAL evidence, and REAL REASON, don't allow such ridiculously subjective interpretations.\n \n \n \nSo who gets to decide what evidence qualifies as valid?\n\n I can see you're trying to pull this conversation back into THAT direction, and I'm not biting...\n The reality of the situation is that you and I just GIVE OUR REASONS WHY we have our positions (and what evidence qualifies as valid), and then people can judge for themselves.\n \n \n \nSee, you're conflating an issue for which observation gives proof with a subjective sociological issue. It's much harder to determine the line someone crosses where a given behavior turns into bona fide misogyny.\n\n Attempting to vague-ify the discussion. Another repeated tactic.\n Let's get to specifics...\n \n Eph 5:24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so [let] the wives [be] to their own husbands in every thing.\n \n 1Ti 2:11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.\n 1Ti 2:12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.\n 1Ti 2:13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.\n 1Ti 2:14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.\n 1Ti 2:15 Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.\n \n We'll keep it short for now, since I doubt this conversation will even go anywhere.\n I contend these bible passages demonstrate EXPLICIT misogyny.\n Moreover, if ANY INDIVIDUAL (non-religious) had espoused these positions, recognizing them as misogynistic would be easy. It is ONLY your religious attachment which prevents you from admitting the obvious.\n Do you dispute that?\n \n \n \nReligion's stance on controversial SOCIAL issues is of a much different type than, say, it's insistence at one time to the Ptolemaic model of the universe. One is a distinctly MORAL issue. The other is a distinctly scientific one.\n\n And again your obfuscation sets in.\n I never said this misogyny (and refuting it) was \"scientific\".\n The point was that REASON and NOT religion was responsible for the Christianity's misogynistic \"end\".\n \n \n \nFoundit, I'm not saying they aren't mutually exclusive--frankly, I think you're wasting a lot of attention here on something no one is arguing.\n\n I have provided a variety of posts lately, and THIS TOPIC is the one you chose to stop ignoring me on...\n You're the one providing the focus, ignoring other issues. Not me...\n \n \n \nThe claim made that I took issue with was that faith equates to LACK OF REASON, not that they aren't mutually exclusive.\n\n I think you need to draw a Venn diagram to explain how you think that works... \n But I'll leave it up to you to provide your own explanation...\n \n \n \nTHAT'S an issue where religion did intrude on something verifiable with observation. Unless you can observe God, you can't verify IT. Or moral questions. One is a reason-based issue. Others are not.\n\n 1) I am not saying that \"science\" can quantify \"moral\" questions, so please be more careful about delineating the different angles of this issue.\n 2) Reason CAN BE applied to \"moral\" issues. If that needs to be said, it's said.\n 3) The point was simply this. \"Faith\" starts from somewhere, and in religion's case too often it begins with \"this old guy who thought burning bushes talked to him many thousands of years ago told us to do this\".\n Now, applying REASON to that situation would cause one to realize that if somebody TODAY had said something like that, we would ask what drugs he was on.\n But because there is \"history\" to this, some people follow it.\n Where is the \"reason\" that tells you that following the words of men who has been shown wrong in SOOOO many ways is intelligent?\n \n \n \nWell, faith isn't some sentient entity that could experience an emotion.\n\n I'm not talking about \"faith\", but rather LEADERS of faith who make proclamations and throw people in jail for saying \"the earth is round\" or restrict other people from church cause they don't like how they voted on certain issues.\n It's about POWER and the EXERTION of that power. Too many religions are about CONTROL, which is one of the problems with a LOT of Christianity's approach to the \"gay\" thing.\n THAT is the \"sentient entity\" I was referring to.\n \n \n \nI suppose it's possible there has been \"jealousy\" at times toward reason, but that's only in cases where religion was trying to explain an issue verifiable via observation. Frankly, I'd chalk up the slowness to come around on scientific issues--like what Galileo was doing, for instance---to human nature and people's natural aversion to change.\n\n Really?\n Cause I've got a variety of examples of how RELIGION has impeded science.\n Can you provide examples of how AGNOSTICISM or ATHEISM have impeded science?\n \n I mean, if it's just \"human nature\", this should be a no-brainer...\n \n \n \nBut not whether morality should be based only on whether something is harmful ...\n\n 1) You speak of \"morality\"?\n You fail to recognize I am referring to the U.S. CONSTITUTION.\n Legitimate state interest and the like.\n \n 2) Don't change the goal-posts.\n Anti-gay Christianity often tries to cloak their anti-gay prejudice in the pretense of \"harm\".\n If you want to start rebuking THEM by telling THEM that they are using the wrong morality, then please do so.\n Otherwise, your interest is too obviously one-sided...\n \n \n \nYes, I already said problems come into play when one crosses over into the other. That doesn't mean they aren't mutually exclusive concepts.\n\n They are, for the reasons I have already stated.\n Rorschach and chicken bones are not \"evidence\" or \"reason\".\n \n \n \nReason sticks it's nose into religion TOO, when it starts trying to concern itself with religious-only questions and trying to make people question faith for no good reason.\n\n Please. Name me some \"religious-only questions\" that \"reasons\" has stuck its nose into... \n I'm already addressing your follow-on example of...\n \n \n \nIt's never going to prove or disprove the existence of God, or prove/disprove the historical Jesus, for instance.\n\n And I agree completely.\n Reason WILL NOT prove or disprove the existence of God. Of some CLAIMS REGARDING God (like when he created the earth), yes.\n People who try to say otherwise are (IMO) abusing the claim to \"reason\". And my above statements regarding \"reason\" and exclusivity with \"faith\" apply just as well to that example you just gave.\n \n \n \nAnd at that point, you beg the question. That's much of the WHOLE gay-related-issue debate, after all--whether or not gay-related issues--or more importantly--morality as it pertains to such issues--fall under such a category. I agree with you that churches have stuck their nose into issues they shouldn't. But I think often what people such as yourself react to as churches going too far is often just people speaking about their moral beliefs.\n\n Quote me.\n You claim to \"think\" that, but you just said something that I will demonstrate is an obviously false statement.\n Over and over again, my reactions are ROUTINELY regarding churches \"going too far\" because they try to get the GOVERNMENT to DISCRIMINATE against gays.\n \n \n \nThe only way people could just \"keep that belief in their own life\" without influencing anyone is to make it a point to do it only in secret. A secret belief.\n\n That's another false statement.\n I am not talking about restricting their first amendment free speech. Over and over again, I have demonstrated PROTECTION of their right to free speech.\n I mean, I hear you and Archie talk about how you are against \"homosexual sex\", but that sure as heck doesn't influence me.\n \n The \"influence\" I have EXPLICITLY demonstrated is the OVERT ACTION to try to force the government to enact or maintain discrimination of gays.\n \n You are trying to MISREPRESENT the situation to pretend that my comments or desires are \"infringing\" upon you or others, but that is absurdly false.\n \n \n \n(Incidentally, I thought gay marriage wasn't supposed to be a \"political\" issue, according to some who defend it. But the basis for which prop 8 opposers are opposing Mormons is that they were engaging in politics as a church.) \n\n Quote what you are referencing, otherwise I have no clue as to where your confusion lies.\n \n But at face value, where is the contradiction in your comment?\n If I were to say \"Gay marriage shouldn't be a political issue\", and then I argue against \"Mormons engaging in politics on the gay marriage issue in their church is wrong\", that's not a contradiction.\n They are entirely consistent, and \"gay marriage shouldn't be a political issue\" is obviously ONE POSSIBLE REASON for saying \"Mormons engaging in politics on the gay marriage issue in their church is wrong\".\n \n \n \nCan you get the fact that while \"faith\" is applied to non-reason issues, that also \"reason\" is not applied when the issue is faith-based?\n If \"reason\" were applicable, it wouldn't be just \"faith\" anymore...\n\n \nNo, because there are issues for which reason can't reall deal with.\n\n So what?\n WHERE is the contradiction?\n \n Reason can't deal with the existence of God, which is a \"faith\" issue.\n That is CONSISTENT with my explanation. It contradicts nothing I have said.\n Reason CANNOT deal with those issues, and faith (mutually exclusive in BOTH directions) DOES deal with those issues.\n That would be incidental evidence of my point!\n \n \n \nEr ... it's what Jesus said. Not an excuse Christians are using ... emoticon_confused\n\n Jesus pulled the Jedi mind trick, and it worked for you guys.\n The legal standard DID exist, and it was long-standing. Jesus was busted in breaking it.\n He DID break it. But then, Jesus said something that SOME Christians interpret as \"these aren't the droids you're looking for\", and the Christians readily agree \"hey! we don't want these droids\".\n \n But the truth is simple.\n 1) The legal standard was ESTABLISHED BY GOD. \n 2) It was incontrovertibly defined as something Jesus was guilty of violating.\n 3) NOTHING Jesus said demonstrates that the \"no work on the Sabbaoth\" commandment no longer applies.\n He made some historical references to previous people breaking the law FOR SPECIFIC REASONS, which in no way justifies the law's abolishment.\n \n \n \nIn Christianity, when Jesus says something, it IS God speaking. You might as well be saying God clarified what he meant.\n\n We already have discussed that too, and you lost.\n God ALREADY CLARIFIED what he meant with Moses and MANNA IN THE DESERT.\n God CLEARLY established that gathering food (manna) that was lying on the ground WAS A SIN.\n There was no \"clarification\" here. Jesus violated that standard.\n \n \n \nAgain, it's fascinating how critics of religious people hold them to a more legalistic standard than religious people THEMSELVES often hold to.\n\n Let's rephrase that to be MORE accurate.\n \"... religious people THEMSELVES often hold THEMSELVES ACCOUNTABLE to\"\n Cause Jesus spoke EXPLICITLY about the restrictions on divorce, yet evangelicals have the HIGHEST divorce rate.\n \n But when it comse to \"gay marriage\", Jesus NEVER SAID ANYTHING about prohibiting it. He never said you can't let OTHERS do it.\n He never said \"You can't allow gays to adopt\". He never said \"Gays can't serve in the military\".\n \n Religious people (specifically in this case, Christians) CREATE legalistic standards to infringe upon other people's lives...\n ... and you'll turn around and proclaim \"but that's what they believe\" ...\n ... but when it comes to what the bible TELLS THE CHRISTIANS THEMSELVES, they'll move heaven and earth to avoid the inconvenient and disagreeable commands.\n \n \n \nThe WHOLE point of Jesus elaborating to saying \"love God and love your neighbor\" and love your enemies, etc. was so that people CAN use their brains (reason!!) in terms of the OT law. He's pointing out basic stuff, freeing them from legalism. That much is obvious.\n\n No. What is obvious is how you are READING the chicken bones.\n Cause you see, people in Jesus' time, WHO WERE THERE when Jesus spoke, read something COMPLETELY different.\n They saw the chicken bones as saying \"I can love my slave, but he still has to serve me. I can also sell him off to other people.\"\n They saw the rorschach as saying \"I can love my wife and other women, but the bible espouses the standards the women must live by. They cannot teach. They are inferior to man's superiority\"\n \n This APOLOGETIC junk came later, after SOCIETY evolved and Religion started looking for \"apologetics\" to justify why they were coming up to speed.\n \n What is REALLY interesting is how you try to EXCUSE people who INFRINGE UPON GAY LIVES as \"just a belief\", when the bible NEVER tells them to act that way...\n ... but when the bible DOES EXPLICITLY tell them how to act, you ignore that they ignore it and look for apologetic \"reasons\" for why.\n \n \n \nNo. The existence of religious scientists proves that wrong.\n\n I said the CONCEPTS are mutually exclusive. I never said that PEOPLE couldn't use both.\n What just happened is I said \"red is not green and green is not red\", and you try to contradict that by pointing to a coloring box that has both a red and green crayola.\n \n \n \nAnd there you go again. There is absolutely NO reason for that sort of rhetoric \"cried like a stuck pig.\" Why can't you just have a conversation? A straight, basic, friendly conversation without things like that? Is it really asking so much?\n\n Let's put this in perspective by giving you a dose of your own medicine.\n \"And there you go again. There is absolutely NO reason for that sort of rhetoric \"foundit66 is insulting\" Why can't you just have a conversation? A straight, basic, friendly conversation without things like that? Is it really asking so much? Can you stop trying to pretend that I am being \"insulting\"?\"\n \n \"Cried like a stuck pig\" is not saying you are a pig. It's an analogy of the over-emotionality (i.e. passive-aggressiveness) you put into my simple NON-INSULTING comment of an observation on how much you post on the gay thing.\n I never judged you for it. But you cried \"insult!\" anyways.\n \n \n \nWhen Lesz says he's against Christianity or religion, he's not taking into account that the real problems are SOME in the religion. That's a form of intolerance. it's like someone saying \"I'm against gays\" because of the actions of the gays in Castro. \n\n I asked you to \"please quote what you're referring to\", and without surprise you don't.\n If that description is true, it's more an issue where religion HAS A FLAWED MECHANISM which leads to this response.\n It's like not using iron for a water design, because it rusts. And while you might be able to point to areas that don't have the rust, it's all susceptible to it.\n Religion and faith, like I have been pointing out, ARE SEPARATE from \"reason\". \"Reason\" leads to advancements in science and medicine, and would have moved a lot more smoothly if \"religion\" had just stayed out of the way.\n \n \n \nWhen you demand Christians criticize Christians, but don't demand that gays criticize gays...\n\n Yup. There is it.\n Big Ol' BLOWI\n Can you point to ANY substantiation of your claim \"but don't demand that gays criticize gays\"?\n Cause considering I and others have REPEATEDLY criticized Matthew's approach, that statement is just plain false.\n \n \n \nChristians should no more have to spend time calling down other Christians that they really don't have much in common with than other gays should spend time calling down other gays.\n\n Oh COME ON.\n Wrong on SOOO many levels.\n \n 1) The Nazis should spend no more time calling down other Nazis than the Jews spend time calling down other Jews.\n While the analogy is NOT meant to be indicative of the degree of the disparity, it IS indicative of a fundamental flaw with the issue.\n \n 2) Do you seriously not get how much time that gays have ACTUALLY spent on these boards criticizing other gays and gay rights approaches?\n OVER and OVER and OVER again on the \"disrupted church services\" threads, gay rights supporters OPPOSED such actions.\n On the \"christians run out of castro\" thread, gay rights supporters OPPOSED such actions.\n But this sub-section of the forum is MORE FILLED with the heinous actions of anti-gay christians, and the routine thing we get out of you is \"but it's their belief\" and other pointless observations.\n \n So, to put it in a nut-shell, even thought Christians have MORE to warrant Christian mutual correction, Christians spend LESS TIME DOING that then gays spend on gay mutual correction.\n \n \n \nWhen you misrepresent Christians going by what Jesus says as \"making excuses\", you are revealing an intolerance.\n\n By that logic, when you misrepresent gays as \"being intolerant\" supposedly \"just because we disagree\", then you are revealing intolerance.\n \n \n \nAnd I answered yours (mainly for the benefit of others as well).\n\n And for the further answer of YOUR intolerance, I utilize the standard you just created out of thin air above.\n When you misrepresent gays as \"being intolerant\" supposedly \"just because we disagree\", then you are revealing intolerance.\n I invite you to continue arguing with your own imaginary standard...",

   "For the sake of brevity, I'm going to condense and only going to respond to major points and not participate in the 'personal-about-you' type discussions. I just don't have time to spend on these long, long posts.\n \n First, let's get this one quick item out of the way ... (hopefully you're starting to see I'm going to keep calling you on this sort of thing)\n ROFLMAO!\n\n There's no need to laugh at people. No need to be hostile. But at least you didn't make a whole post of 'em this time.\n \n \n On to the rest ....\n \n \n Evidence ....\n \n Yes, sometimes there are \"SEPARATE\" pieces of evidence for things; that's an inconsequential distinction. \n \n The \"Rorschach and chicken bone\" examples are another one of taking an extreme example. Come on, venture out .... try on miracles and healings that couldn't happen otherwise; visions, and the like, on for size. (In my experience, there will always be given an non-spiritual excuse by the critic/skeptic to explain it away, even to the point of the excuse becoming less likely than the spiritual explanation. Visions? Drug use [even when there's evidence against the idea that drugs were used]. Healings with things that shouldn't heal? Oh, you know, the body does amazing things sometimes!) The question has been asked 'at what point WOULD you accept religious experience as evidence? Usually, the point is still missed upon hearing that question. And besides, who decides Rorschach and chicken bone don't count? Who made skeptics the ones who get to define what counts as evidence? If I have a pair of dice, and I pray \"Lord, if you want me to do so-and-so, let me roll snake eyes 5 times in a row\" and it HAPPENS, why is THAT not evidence that something (e.g. God) influenced the dice roll? At some point, the practically impossible occurrence has to be considered evidence of something, rather than demanding more evidence on evidence on evidence.\n \n At any rate, taking one's experiences and making a determination based on that evidence IS using reason. That's the bottom line.\n \n What matters is when something from \"reason\" CONTRADICTS faith. That's the ONLY time this is an issue, and the only time faith exists as a LACK of reason. Because reason isn't lost if it's not an issue to begin with. If reason says the earth is billions of years old (something determinable by observation) then it contradicts faith that says the earth is 6000 years old. THAT I would agree is an example where reason is lacking. But if we take the question of whether God created the universe--a much more general question--there's no contradiction. There's no loss of reason there to believe that. None of the processes observed are ignored by having that belief: the evidence of the big bang, the direction of out-moving matter, the cooling of the universe, the evidence of the age of the earth, etc.\n \n \n \n Logic-based observation issues versus subjective ones ....\n \n It's true that reason can be applied to morality, but not to any definitive end. What is moral in one culture may not be in another, after all. Two cultures may judge the other immoral based on competing forms of reason standards. It's still not like applying reason to \n \n \n \n Jesus' words and other Bible quotes ...\n \n It's interesting that when critics WANT to judge Christianity by the Bible, they define the religion as THAT. When they want to judge it by the actions of Christians instead, they define it THAT way instead of by the Bible. Look, it's one or the other--you can't have your cake and eat it too here. When it's convenient you play up the differences between Christians and the Bible, or use the actions of Christians as the standard of how you're defining the religion at the time. On the other hand, then you use the Bible if you want to define it by something negative you see there. (Sort of sounds like how a fundie might approach things, huh?)\n \n Yes, there are passages that come across as misogynistic in our culture. But that doesn't change what Jesus said. We read Jesus as saying love others and clarifying things because that's what he said, not because we want him to have said that and it's convenient at the time (which seems to be part of your claim). And SINCE that's what he said, when people mistreat women, they aren't abiding by what he said. It's really not that complicated. If someone says to be loving toward other people, and then you go and mistreat them, you aren't being loving toward other people. It's not rocket science, ya know. The thing is, as thick a book as the Bible is with multiple authors addressing numerous situations, at some point something's going to be found that can be used against it. \n \n Re. the sabbath thing, look, how does God violate something God puts in place? Or more importantly, how does that violation matter? It's like saying a state legislature makes a law, then claiming they are \"violating\" the law by going back later and changing it or updating it. No, they CREATED that law; they can certainly come back around and change it or revise it anytime they want. No one is saying he abolished the idea that we shouldn't work on the sabbath. I already pointed that what he was dealing with was approaching rules like that from a LEGALISTIC standpoint. He was saying you don't need to be LEGALISTIC about it. It's ok to get your ox out of the ditch.\n \n \n \n The claim that \" influence ..... is the OVERT ACTION to try to force the government to enact or maintain discrimination of gays\" ....\n \n Now hold on a second... How exactly has anyone tried to force the government to do something here? People were trying to influence a VOTE. You might as well be claiming that, by saying we should vote for Obama, someone is trying to \"force\" the government to have Obama as president. It's a rather strange way of wording it; no one is holding a gun to anyone's head here. \n \n By that standard, ANYTIME anything is voted for, it's trying to \"force\" the government to do something. If that's all you mean, then sure. No problem there--that's the process. I certainly wouldn't word it that way, (\"force\" is a rather negative term, and that may very well be why you use that terminology.)",

   "It doesn't matter if reason is no worse the wear for it, and there's no loss. It's not like there's any less reason in your examples than it would be otherwise. Frankly, not everyone wants to live this cold, calculated way of thinking that can't allow for believing in something fun or mysterious. Faith can be there ALONGSIDE reason acknowledging there are \"gaps in our knowledge\"--and ironically, that's often the case. Frankly, you just won't let faith win, for anything, even if there's no loss of reason going on! If it's ONLY used in area where reason isn't even applicable, you still attack it on this basis, even when reason couldn't even BE applicable! And that refusal to let something like that ever have the benefit of the doubt is the stuff of fundies and ideologues, really.\n\n \n It's one thing to retreat into a fantasy world of Star Trek or whatever for fun and mystery. It's entirely another to grow to think that world is real.\n \n Faith is devoid of reason because it has nothing for reason to get a grip on. It might not be unreasonable to believe, say, that there was a prime mover that began the universe we inhabit. However, Christians and other fideists go far beyond that. Christians want us to believe that there was a prime mover; that \"he\" made \"man\" in \"his\" own image; that he was born human of a virgin woman; that he died and rose from the dead; that he will come again and forgive the sins of those who believe in him; that those believers will have eternal life; that infidels will perish in hell; that this god is fascinated by our behaviour, especially our sexual habits; that he takes an intimate and personal interest in all our daily doings; etc., etc., etc.\n \n Where, for god's sakes, is there an ounce of reason in ANY of that? There isn't any at all. It is all pure fantasy, that Christians like to believe is real. That is no better than Trekkies at a convention, and frankly, I think it's a lot worse -- at least Trekkies mostly know they are fulfilling a fantasy... they don't really think they are graduates of some Space Academy. They actually do it for fun, and nothing wrong with theatrics like that, so long as you keep in mind they are theatrics.\n \n Faith does not exist \"alongside\" reason. It exists in opposition to it. The mindset needed for the practice of faith is contrary to that needed for the exercise of reason. This doesn't mean that all people of faith are necessarily unreasonable in everything they think or do, just that in some aspects of their lives they prefer to abjure reason for leaps of faith.\n \n I am not of their number, and I don't accept their faith beliefs are reasonable at all.",

   "For the sake of brevity, I'm going to condense and only going to respond to major points and not participate in the 'personal-about-you' type discussions. I just don't have time to spend on these long, long posts.\n\n Why do I suspect that \"major points\" are going to be ignored.\n Especially when your paraphrasement of my \"major points\" are going to get ignored, especially since you \"paraphrase\" my entire post down to a measly 36 words...\n \n \n \nThere's no need to laugh at people. No need to be hostile. But at least you didn't make a whole post of 'em this time.\n\n 1) I wasn't laughing at you.\n I was laughing at your ARGUMENT.\n That should have been plain when I proceeded to talk about \"your STATEMENT\".\n 2) That's not hostile.\n 3) The \"whole post of 'em\" is as grotesque a misrepresentation as \"36 words\" is a grotesque misrepresentation of my points.\n \n \n \nEvidence ....\n Yes, sometimes there are \"SEPARATE\" pieces of evidence for things; that's an inconsequential distinction. \n\n No. Not \"inconsequential\".\n THE EXAMPLE YOU GAVE, which I was responding to, was an example of \"'separate' pieces of evidence for things\".\n I pointed out THAT was the flaw in your attempted analogy. Of course, when you just try to summarize my statement with one word of \"evidence\", that misrepresentation of yours was very easy, huh....\n \n \n \nThe \"Rorschach and chicken bone\" examples are another one of taking an extreme example. Come on, venture out .... try on miracles and healings that couldn't happen otherwise; visions, and the like, on for size.\n\n People used to think Halley's Comet was some sort of mystical occurrence.\n Before they knew better...\n \n The \"Rorschach and chicken bone\" examples are right on. \"Miracles\" are one of those great urban legends that get passed around, like that pesky \"They're going to / have removed 'Touched by an Angel' cause it includes prayer\".\n Why is it that independent and objective verification of these things habitually fails?\n \n And for the record, you have moved past the earlier bench-mark into the realm of \"we have no CURRENT explanation, so we're going to put our own interpretation into the situation instead\".\n Just cause \"reason\" hasn't gotten an answer yet doesn't make the issue the realm of \"religion\".\n \n \n \n(In my experience, there will always be given an non-spiritual excuse by the critic/skeptic to explain it away, even to the point of the excuse becoming less likely than the spiritual explanation. Visions? Drug use [even when there's evidence against the idea that drugs were used].\n\n 1) Don't move the goal-posts. Don't substitute \"spiritual\" when the issue is RELIGIOUS.\n 2) Look up \"ergot poisoning\" and the Salem Witch trials.\n After that, look up \"schizophrenia\".\n After that, \"Jim Jones\" and \"cults\".\n \n \n \nHealings with things that shouldn't heal? Oh, you know, the body does amazing things sometimes!)\n\n I have no problem admitting to real connections between mind and body.\n But that doesn't mean a \"God\" did it instead...\n \n \n \nThe question has been asked 'at what point WOULD you accept religious experience as evidence?\n\n That question, in and of itself, is an oxymoron.\n \"Religious *experience*\" is not \"evidence\".\n In the above situations, your interpretation is that God did it, *even to the point of the excuse becoming less likely than the religious (my substitution) than the reasoned approach to an explanation.\n Your idea of \"evidence\" is that you propose an IDEA THAT HAS NO REASON behind it, and pretend it's just as valid (if not supposedly more) than simply saying \"we don't know\".\n Just cause you make up an answer doesn't mean it's more valid than \"we don't know\".\n \n \n \nUsually, the point is still missed upon hearing that question. And besides, who decides Rorschach and chicken bone don't count? Who made skeptics the ones who get to define what counts as evidence?\n\n Yup. There is that repeated attempt at misdirection.\n NOBODY \"made skeptics the ones who get to define\"...\n I used MERRIAM-WEBSTER's definition.\n I pose an argument that makes sense.\n \n Don't pull this lame junk where you whine and pretend it's an argument. You are JUST AS CAPABLE of providing your own definition of \"what counts as evidence\".\n Your problem is that you're subconsciously admitting (by pulling that stunt) that you KNOW your definition is inferior.\n It's that religious jealousy thing. Religion wanting to pretend it's more than it truly is.\n \n \n \nIf I have a pair of dice, and I pray \"Lord, if you want me to do so-and-so, let me roll snake eyes 5 times in a row\" and it HAPPENS, why is THAT not evidence that something (e.g. God) influenced the dice roll?\n\n Jyoshu.\n I will consider that as evidence WHEN and ONLY WHEN you are able to say that, roll five times and it DOES NOT happen, and that makes you realize \"that's evidence that there is no God\"...\n WHY is it that ALL the \"evidence\" comes up as ACCEPTING the existence of God, but NEVER refuting???\n THAT is part of the reason claiming \"experience\" as any kind of indicator of \"evidence\" towards God's existence is wrong.\n \n And the other thing people like you don't seem to realize is that \"rolling snake eyes five times\" is just as possible as any other specific roll. That has the SAME probability of rolling a 2 and a 3, a 5 and 1, a 6 and 2, a 4 and 5, and a 1 and 3.\n It's just that you mistakenly give more importance to one over the other...\n Why isn't God's presence determined by that die roll?\n Cause you personally attach no significance to it.\n \n \n \nAt some point, the practically impossible occurrence has to be considered evidence of something, rather than demanding more evidence on evidence on evidence.\n\n Getting hit by lightning is practically impossible.\n Winning the lottery is practically impossible.\n Those things still happen.\n \n \n \nAt any rate, taking one's experiences and making a determination based on that evidence IS using reason. That's the bottom line.\n\n Not when somebody can look at the SAME EVIDENCE and just as validly comes up with a different interpretation.\n What you call \"experience\" is typically code for allowing a long list of OTHER mis-identifications to proceed unchallenged.\n \n \n \nWhat matters is when something from \"reason\" CONTRADICTS faith. That's the ONLY time this is an issue, and the only time faith exists as a LACK of reason. Because reason isn't lost if it's not an issue to begin with.\n\n Actually, it is.\n People didn't know the earth went around the sun. But when people started saying \"Yeah it does\", people who had \"faith\" that it had to be something else spoke up and prevented the others.\n The problem is that the people PRETEND that the \"reason isn't lost\", when the truth is that it just HAS NOT BEEN FOUND yet.\n And when people start asking the REAL question, and using REASON to look for it, people with \"faith\" get in the way.\n \n \n \nIf reason says the earth is billions of years old (something determinable by observation) then it contradicts faith that says the earth is 6000 years old. THAT I would agree is an example where reason is lacking. But if we take the question of whether God created the universe--a much more general question--there's no contradiction. There's no loss of reason there to believe that.\n\n Just as much \"loss of reason\" as to believe the flying spaghetti monster \"feetflower\" sneezed the universe out his nose.\n It's just that your \"faith\" is more accepted, while the fact that the spaghetti monster has as much validity and as much \"evidence\" is disregarded because he ain't the popular \"faith\" answer.\n \n \n \nLogic-based observation issues versus subjective ones ....\n It's true that reason can be applied to morality, but not to any definitive end. What is moral in one culture may not be in another, after all. Two cultures may judge the other immoral based on competing forms of reason standards. It's still not like applying reason to \n\n Funny how another \"major\" issue of mine is addressed by a non-sequitur.\n \n \n \nJesus' words and other Bible quotes ...\n It's interesting that when critics WANT to judge Christianity by the Bible, they define the religion as THAT. When they want to judge it by the actions of Christians instead, they define it THAT way instead of by the Bible.\n\n That's just as interesting as the fact that Christians DO THE SAME THING to their convenience...\n Actually, my point is more interesting cause I personally try not to judge the religion by the actions of its self-proclaimed followers.\n Can you show me where I judged Christianity (the religion) by the actions of Christians?\n \n \n \nLook, it's one or the other--you can't have your cake and eat it too here.\n\n Same right back atcha.\n \n \n \nYes, there are passages that come across as misogynistic in our culture. But that doesn't change what Jesus said.\n\n And more importantly, what Jesus said DOES NOT CHANGE THOSE OTHER PASSAGES.\n The passages I quoted (which you obviously ignored) came AFTER Jesus from Jesus's followers.\n How is it that they KNEW what Jesus said, and some of them HEARD his words (or knew people who did), and yet they came away with an entirely different interpetation?\n \n Your interpretation IGNORES sections of the bible.\n \n \n [quoet=jyoshu]We read Jesus as saying love others and clarifying things because that's what he said, not because we want him to have said that and it's convenient at the time (which seems to be part of your claim). And SINCE that's what he said, when people mistreat women, they aren't abiding by what he said. It's really not that complicated.[/quote]\n But here's the thing.\n Who says that they were \"mistreating women\"?\n That's by your MODERN standards, that you achieved INDEPENDENT of the bible.\n Do you see any bible passage on \"equality\" in the bible? Definitely NOT for equality between the genders.\n They did not think they were \"mistreating\" women by preventing them from being teachers.\n Some Christians even today think that women should be subordinate to men, and they see no \"mistreatment\".\n ESPECIALLY since the women involved would be partaking of their social order BY THEIR OWN CHOICE.\n \n You CLAIM \"mistreatment\" cause you need an out. You need a way to explain away the civil violation of the bible, which modern man recognizes.\n And you do so by stating something that Jesus NEVER even really hinted at...\n \n Tell me. If I were to search a variety of concordances for \"Love thy neighbor\", how many of them are going to say ANYTHING about gender???\n \n \n \nThe thing is, as thick a book as the Bible is with multiple authors addressing numerous situations, at some point something's going to be found that can be used against it.\n\n Are you admitting to Biblical self-contradiction?\n \n \n \nRe. the sabbath thing, look, how does God violate something God puts in place?\n\n Simple.\n I hearby state that from here-on out, NO word shall be used that has the letter \"e\" in it.\n You hear me? NOBODY gets to use any word that has the letter \"e\" in it.\n \n See? Easy enough!\n \n \n \nOr more importantly, how does that violation matter?\n\n And there's the real issue.\n Christians have come to \"realize\" that Jesus's words on divorce \"don't matter\".\n They have stated that God's words on working on the Sabbaoth \"don't matter\".\n They have come to a variety of conclusions where \"violation\" doesn't \"matter\".\n \n \n \nIt's like saying a state legislature makes a law, then claiming they are \"violating\" the law by going back later and changing it or updating it.\n\n Jesus wasn't saying he was \"updating\" the law.\n Do you want to quote what Jesus ACTUALLY said?\n He was REWRITING HISTORY in his statements.\n The legal precedent was clear. You aren't even trying to question it!\n \n \n \nI already pointed that what he was dealing with was approaching rules like that from a LEGALISTIC standpoint. He was saying you don't need to be LEGALISTIC about it. It's ok to get your ox out of the ditch.\n\n And what happened with Moses and the manna in the desert.\n \n Like I predicted, you are quoting \"36 words\" in order to ignore major points...\n \n \n \nThe claim that \" influence ..... is the OVERT ACTION to try to force the government to enact or maintain discrimination of gays\" ....\n Now hold on a second... How exactly has anyone tried to force the government to do something here?\n\n Prop 8.\n And please don't quibble over the word \"force\".\n I could use all sorts of synonym words to replace that one there, and my REAL point would remain.\n \n You DID NOT address my main points.\n You addressed what points you thought you could hit for YOUR MAIN interest and achievement.\n \n In that section, you only fixated on ONE WORD that wasn't even my point!\n That's just plain lame!",

They don't seem to have any problem with it as you do.\n\n \n Well, the bible taught many Christians to be bigots. I leave that to you to reason out. Or not.\n \n \nNope, nobody has claimed faith 'was based on reason.' You, on the other hand made the claim that it's the absence of reason, and that religion and faith aren't alongside each other, remember? The claim that flies in the face of people of faith who use both alongside each other all the time.\n\n \n Sorry, but people of faith do NOT use reason in justifying their faith. Reason has always failed them there. They use emotion. Perhaps your own emotion clouds your awareness of this reality.",

You have persuaded me you haven't any serious argument to offer in favour of religion, or its homophobic manifestations. It's all just bluster.\n \n You've never seen any light.

   "\n They aren't unique to religious believers, let alone Christians. they are humanitarian because they are compassionate human beings, not because they believe in Jesus. Jesus is the way they rationalise it to themselves. All the atheists I've known have been equally compassionate.\n\"If we did a good act merely from the love of God and a belief that is pleasing to him, whence arises the morality of the Atheist? It is idle to say, as some do, that no such thing exists. We have the same evidence of the fact as of most of those we act on, to wit: their own affirmations, and their reasonings in support of them. I have observed, indeed, generally that while in Protestant countries the defections from the Platonic Christianity of the priests is to Deism, in Catholic countries they are to Atheism. Diderot, D'Alembert, D'Holbach, Condorcet are known to have been among the most virtuous of men. Their virtue, then, must have had some other foundation than love of God.\"Thomas Jefferson, letter to Thomas Law, June 13, 1814",
