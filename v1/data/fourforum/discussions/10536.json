   "Straffas original paper:\n http://cupid.ecom.unimelb.edu.au/het/sraffa/sraffa26.htm\n \n And Steve Keen's summaries:\n http://www.debunking-economics.com/Maths/Present_for_Sraffa.htm\n http://debunkingeconomics.com/Value/Actual/Index.htm\n http://debunkingeconomics.com/Value/capacity.htm\n \n As Steve Keen (professor in economics and finance, Uni of West Sydney) puts it, the consequences of this are as follows:\n \n \"Strange as it may seem . . . this is a very big deal. If marginal returns are constant rather than falling, then the neo-classical explanation of everything collapses. Not only can economic theory no longer explain how much a firm produces, it can explain nothing else.\" \n \n \"Take, for example, the economic theory of employment and wage determination . . . The theory asserts that the real wage is equivalent to the marginal product of labour . . . An employer will employ an additional worker if the amount the worker adds to output -- the worker's marginal product -- exceeds the real wage . . . [This] explains the economic predilection for blaming everything on wages being too high -- neo-classical economics can be summed up, as [John Kenneth] Galbraith once remarked, in the twin propositions that the poor don't work hard enough because they're paid too much, and the rich don't work hard enough because they're not paid enough . . . \"\n \n \"If in fact the output to employment relationship is relatively constant, then the neo-classical explanation for employment and output determination collapses. With a flat production function, the marginal product of labour will be constant, and it will never intersect the real wage. The output of the form then can't be explained by the cost of employing labour. . . [This means that] neo-classical economics simply cannot explain anything: neither the level of employment, nor output, nor, ultimately, what determines the real wage . . .the entire edifice of economics collapses.\" [Debunking Economics, pp. 76-7]",
