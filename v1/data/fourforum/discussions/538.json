   "I decided to make this thread in light of a recent thread *on the old forum* in which many people felt that 'technology' was in some way a bad thing. It is not a direct response to anything in the thread, but only my thoughts on this matter in general.\n \n Firstly, we must ask ourselves, what is our Goal? What is the one thing we must do? The answer is, of course, to escape from this planet. It is fairly easy to hypothesise that this is in fact the reason we exist - merely as a tool in Life's great struggle for survival.\n \n Put simply, it is plain that we have all our eggs in one basket. We are simply at too much risk here. The threat of nuclear war will hang over our heads, and although I don't suggest for one minute that a nuclear war is likely, or that it would destroy all life, it is still possible. There is also the risk of being hit by a comet, which we will be unable to protect ourselves against for a while yet. Humans have been lucky to inhabit a time-space in which no major worldwide extinctions have taken place. But from the fossil record we can see that there have been many such catastrophes throughout time, most famously the Dinosaurs, and even earlier than that, 95% of all life was exterminated at one point - a major setback if ever there was one. This is not to mention the unknown risks of 'global warming', whether it is caused by humans or not, and also possible 'super-diseases' in the future which may simply catch us unawares and take us by storm.\n \n Presumably, the Luddites that want to regress to an era of minimal technology do not mean that they would like this only to last for a short time. They mean they would like this Luddite attitude to permeate the whole of human life in the future. \n And if, by some extraordinary chance, we stay on this planet, at one with nature, revelling in our simple lives, for a million years? What then? Ten million? Is this concievable? If it is not, let's say that the Luddites at least postulate that it would be DESIRABLE. So, what of when this planets time is up? If you say that by such an obscenely distant point in the future, we will have colonised other planets by then, then how do you justify your anti-technology philosophy? Why should we put off the march of technology at all, if you concede that eventually we will have to bow to necessity and get our act together?\n \n Of course, the march of technology can never actually be stopped, so to philosophise about stopping it is a purely academic pursuit. But are there more reasons why it is a bad philosophy? \n \n What is it that humans have done throughout their entire history? Living and dying, breeding and dreaming, these things belie our hunger for improvement. \n A human will look at something, and say, 'How can I make it better?' It is this that has lead our species to dominate the planet, to knock aside all resistance, and eventually, to even begin to domesticise the raw process of 'natural selection'. \n For that is the key - although we came from this world, and belong to it as it belongs to us, we yearn to be separate from its dispassionate mechanisms. A Luddite will go camping or grow vegetables, and claim that this modern world is 'forgetting the basics, denying our true instincts' and so on. But would this same person be content to live from second to second, fighting for survival every day, and to be ultimately bound by natural selection (that is, the weak or frail, or the abnormal would be rooted out and at the very least fail to contribute to the gene pool). \n This is how our ancestors lived.\n That's the crux of it - they want to feel as if they are somehow part of the 'nature', yet they would not for a minute care to give up medicine, electricity, advanced forms of transport, computer technology and so on. The fact is, we have always advanced and we live to advance. To go back now would be a terrible mistake. \n \n And the Luddite argument relies on the assumption that current methods of producing energy will somehow always remain. This is not the case. Although current methods pollute and are harmful, it is clear that they will not last, and soon we will be forced to use renewable sources in greater abundance. Would they oppose future technology if it did not pollute in any way? Yet we need current technology in order to research for future technology.\n \n Although it may be pointed out that I may be misusing the term 'Luddite' here, as there are actually very few real Luddites around, I am in fact attacking the rather flimsy, 'trendy' attitude that many people seem to have that 'technology' is nasty and 'nature' is the way to go. I feel I have shown this view to be somewhat misguided. Technology is the culmination of millions of years of life's evolution, so that life might not be doomed to die on this planet. \n \n *mistakenly posted on old forum*",
