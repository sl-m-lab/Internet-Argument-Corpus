   "Whatever happened to real conservatives? They allowed themselves to be sucked in with a bunch of self-serving fringe groups. Politics makes strange bedfellows? It sure does. Since I don't think that these new \"conservatives\" necessarily subscribe to all portions of the platform, the new Republican party could better be called the \"something for everybody\" party.\n \n Let's look at who is in this group.\n \n 1. The small business owners (some of which are actually well-to-do elitists) - who are actually just in it for the money. The smallest of the small businesses frequently don't even offer health insurance.\n \n 2. The \"average\" guy who just wants lower taxes. He's in it for the money, too. He's the guy that voted for the $300 rebate in 2000. Who, if successful, will impact the ability to give the money to the small-businesses.\n \n 3. The pro-lifers, who, if successful, will cost everybody a small fortune supporting unwanted children and impact the ability to give the money to both the small business and the average guys.\n \n 4.

   "Conservative\n \n by Charley Reese\n \n Some letter writer, basking in the reflected glory of George Bush's re-election, included me in a list of what he called \"limousine liberals.\" His mistake was in his apparent definition of \"conservative,\" which he seems to think is somebody who is in favor of foreign wars and against gay marriage and abortion.\n \n So, let me explain what a conservative is. A conservative believes that not only should the Supreme Court strictly construe the Constitution, but so should the president, the House, the Senate, governors, mayors and everybody else. A conservative does not approve of wars, except in defense of the land and the people, and only upon a declaration of war by both houses of Congress. A war to liberate somebody else from a nasty government is unconstitutional, illegal and immoral.\n \n A conservative is against foreign aid. Nowhere in the Constitution is Congress authorized to tax the American people and then hand their money to a foreign government as either a gift or a loan. Nowhere in the Constitution is the federal government authorized to provide welfare, health care, housing or education.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.lewrockwell.com/reese/reese140.html\n \n \n Nation-Building Is Not Conservative\n \n by Rep. Ron Paul\n \n A recent study by the Pentagon's Defense Science Task Force on Strategic Communications concluded that in the struggle for hearts and minds in Iraq, \"American efforts have not only failed, they may also have achieved the opposite of what they intended.\" This Pentagon report flatly states that our war in Iraq actually has elevated support for radical Islamists. It goes on to conclude that our active intervention in the Middle East as a whole has greatly diminished our reputation in the region, and strengthened support for radical groups.\n \n These recent reports are not the product of some radical antiwar organization. They represent the U.S. government's own assessment of our \"progress\" in Iraq after two and a half years and the loss of thousands of lives. We are alienating the Islamic world in our oxymoronic quest to impose democracy in Iraq.\n \n This demonstrates once again the folly of nation-building, which is something candidate Bush wisely rejected before the 2000 election.\n \n Non-interventionism was the foreign policy ideal of the Founding Fathers, an ideal that is ignored by both political parties today. Those who support political and military intervention in Iraq and elsewhere should have the integrity to admit that their views conflict with the principles of our nation's founding.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.antiwar.com/paul/?articleid=4159\n \n \n \n .",

I think that the conservatives in this country should have voted libertarian or constitution party and let Kerry be president for a term. He could not POSSIBLY do worse than Bush in the economic arena, and we would have been fairly well shielded against any outrageous actions since, as a first term president, he really couldn't afford to do anything too crazy, especially since we already pretty much knew that the republicans were going to controll congress.\n \n Bush, on the other hand, is a second term president and has absolutly no incentive to keep his spending or his idiotic foreign policy under control. Couple this with the fact that he is working with a republican controlled congress which seems willing to take their marching orders from Bush (they are not even discreet about it) in the name of showing a united front, and I think that the potential for damage with Bush in the whitehouse is exponentially worse than when kerry was there.\n \n We need to rememebr that without the approval of congress, the president does not have much power on his own. It is not just Bush that scares me, it is the rubber stam that congress has been giving to very bit of legislation that he tosses their way.\n \n The newest antiterrosim bill was over 3000 pages long, and they didn't even bother to distribute a finished draft before voting on it.

His record AND rhetoric tell otherwise.\n \n\n On NBC's Meet the Press in April, Kerry said, \"I'm not going to cut Social Security benefits. I'm not going to extend the retirement age. ... And we're not going to have to raise the premiums.\"\n \n If benefit cuts, retirement-age increases, personal retirement accounts, and tax hikes (raising the \"premiums\") are off the table, there are only two options left: increase the debt by $11 trillion or cut all other government programs by 20 percent. And since Sen. Kerry has routinely criticized President Bush for increasing the debt, one can deduce he's not about to come out in favor of increasing the debt by $11 trillion. http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tuffnell200407290914.asp \n\n That doesn't sound like a good idea to me, but most of Kerry's plans were nothing more than either increasing taxes on everybody or smoke and mirrors that could never work. Lots of promises, but promises without a means of paying for them is nothing more than BS. \n \n Show me one shred of proof that Bush was involved in any kickbacks. Your shallow accusations don't mean didly. Show me the money. \n \n \n\n Kerry's own personal wealth is signifcently less the Bush's.

The problem of tax code complexity is admittedly annoying, the problem of growing debt and decreasing revenues are the result of an administration that can't control their spending.

Fat lot of good it actually does us. George s right, though, that this is one of those things that, if people actually cared, could be implemented on a state level a LOT easier than on a national level, and in some cases HAS been implemented in many states. \n \n George, your analogy of the shell game is right on target. There are so many non issues flaoting around out there distracting us from things that actually matter that it is a wonder we ever actually get to see any real issues.\n \n How many people heard about national ID cards being included in the intelligence reform bill? Most americans don't seem to care much about this, but it was made quite the issue in the media. A few things Americans SHOULD care about that are in the 3000 page bill (which congress passed wihtout a fuinished version ever being made available):\n \n All guidlines regarding the classification of public documents are gone. The Excutive branch now has sole authority to decide what should be classified and what should not.\n \n The director of the central intelligence agency and the new intel czar are EXEMPT from federal requirements to include givfts from foreign nationals in their finacnial disclosure statements, which from now on will be CLASSIFIED.\n \n A new office has been created due to fears that peoples civil rights will be violated. The new postion is \"Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties of the National Intelligence Authority\". They are to be appointed by the president. They are subordinate to the National Intelligence Director and report to him. There is also a privacy officer, who also reports to the National Intelligence Director and is appointed by the national Intelligence director. These positions were created becuase there was concern of abuses by the office of the National Intelligence Director and the origanisations he oversees. In both cases, the \"watchdogs\" are directly subordinate to the NID, and in one case, the NID appoints his OWN watchdog. The foxes watching the foxes watching the hens.\n \n The FBI has a new function. They have been mandated to set up a domestic intelligence office. Tehy are now going to do what the CIA has never been allowed to do (and for good reason). They are there soley to spy on US citizens. The military is to set up a similar office witht he same goals. At first glance it lookas a lot like the MVD (soviet internal security) when you really look at the org chart, though, you realise that these organisations are both under the \"supervision\" of the above mentioned Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties of the National Intelligence Authority, who is the subordinate of the NID, who is responsible for the actions of the new FBI and Military domestic spy organisations. This means that essentially, there is no external oversight. The new NID and the agencies that are subordinate to him operate on their own and are responsible for policing themselves. Seen in this light, the new organisational setup is nothing like the soviets old MVD, which was ultimatly subjegate to the civil authority. This new setup is FAR more like the Vecheka, which was NOT responsible to the civil authority (rather falling under the sole authority of stalin).",

Conservatism of that day is nothing like that of the 50s and 60s. Know your history before opening your mouth. Besides, Washington's comment was in dealing with the early years of the country, where it's economy and military were in no shape to tangle with the European superpowers of the time.

Come on, lets all play nice (I feel I can tell you this because I can recall you tellim gme the same thing before when I got a little too riled up)/ \n \n \nWhich \"poor\" get refunds on taxes that they haven't paid in the first place?\n\n \n Bushs proposed reform has NOTHING to do with this. He is not talking about changing anything important in the tax code, he is simply talking about simplifying the paperwork. \n \n \nIf you make it a state-by-state issue then ambulance chasers will just shop venues for their frivilous class action lawsuits. In order to be effective, it HAS to be a Federal initiative.\n\n \n Why? There is no federal law that says you have to have a drivers license. Every state issues drivers licenses, though. There was no federal mandate required to get that rolling, so why should a federal mandate be required to get tort reform passed in the states?\n \n And in reality, does tort reform really matter? Sure, we have all heard about the lady who got millions for spilling her Mc Donalds coffe in her lap. This kind of thing is the exception, not the rule, and that was a few paltry millions against revenues in excess fo a billion dollars. \n \n Sure, tort reform is a good idea, because there are evil ambulance chasing lawyers out there who are just out looking for the quick buck. On the other hand, tort reform is a bad idea becuase US corporations have a pretty long track record of doing some pretty rotten things to people, and when a corporation intentionally adopts policies which they KNOW are going to hurt people, they deserve to be severely punished. \n \n The problem is that companies that intentionally do irresponsible things, or that intentionally do things that are downright WRONG are not being severely punished, even in teh face of multi million dollar verdicts. Their liabilty insurance goes up a bit and it is back to business as usual. Maybe a better idea would be to abolish corporate liability insurance. This way when companies are called ot the mat, they have to pay, and pay dearly, and a company that is really irresponisble or really evil will not last long in the face of a few big settlements.\n \n The other problem with trot reform is that it may be unconstitutional. It has long been held that the constitution, in recognising the right to a trial by jury in law suits which involve over $20, allows that the jury should decide damages in the case. In the 20's the supreme court ruled a law that put limits on damages related to the oil industry was unconstitutional. The tort reforms they are discussing today are almost carbon copies of that 1920's law. YOUR REPRESENTATIVES KNOW THIS. These guys who are up there calling for damage caps and such KNOW the supreme court has already ruled them unconstitutional, and they KNOW that if they do manage to pass sucha law, it is almost certain that the supreme court will strike it down the minute it hits the docket. They are just trying to score talking points. None of them actually cares about tort reform. They know that these damages are not being paid by companies directly, they are being paid out by the insurance industry, which as a whole is posting multi trillion dollar annual profits.\n \n \nAnd do you understand that as the dollar weakens against foreign currency American-made goods gain a cost advantage over those countries? The global economy isn't a zero sum game. It is possible to both win and lose at the same time.\n\n \n You are about half right here. In the past, short term drops in the value of the dollar have indeed been a long term boost tot eh economy. As the dollar drops, our goods are more competitive on foreign markets. In the past, we have liquidated on hand stocks, and when the dollar went back up (and it always did), we would have all that money we picked up in the dip. It was little more than currency speculation on a national scale.\n \n The problem with this scenario anymore is 2 twofold. First off, we do not produce most of our own raw materials anymore. We do not even produce tool steel in this country anymore. So, our manufacturers buy their raw materials overseas at elevated prices (becuase the dollar is low) and then when we sell them, in order to \"take advatage\" of the low dollar as benifit, they have to sell at the lower price. So you are essentially looking at a situation where in order for those who claim the low dollar is a boon to the economy to be correct, you have to decide that higher overhead in the face of lower profits is a good thing. I think you are going to have trouble convincing anybody who has taken even a basic economics class of this.\n \n The other problem with the scenario outlined abov eis that the old patterns no longer hold true. There is absolutly no indication that the dollar is simply in a dip. It appears that the decline of the dollar is likely a permanent thing. Traditionally we have raised interest rates to control infaltion. This isn't working now (we can start another thread about why not if you would like). \n \n This means that even in cases where US manufaturers are using on hand materials, if they sell for the same price, it is HIGHLY unlikely that the dollar will be coming back up any time in the forseeable future, so they are not going to benifit from a \"temporary low\" like they used to.\n \n In the face of this, the price of US exports are GOING UP. There is no competitive advantage being gained because those guys who run our companies realise that the whole line of thinking you are laying out here is a bunch of BS feel good economic theory and has no place in an economic strategy.\n \n This is one of those things that makes me wonder if our entire nation is not descended from retarded apes. People hear that our exports are more competitive due to the lower dollar. They go \"wow, I guess that is a good thing\" and never think about it again. If you really think that line of reasoning through, it is almost impossible to not realise that YOU ARE STILL LOOSING MONEY.",

It also brings out the Mr Hyde in me. <:-)\n \n\n Bushs proposed reform has NOTHING to do with this. He is not talking about changing anything important in the tax code, he is simply talking about simplifying the paperwork. \n\n While I would agree that the goal is for the reform to be revenue neutral, it gives control back to the wage earner. I can CHOOSE not to spend X dollars and thus avoid a percentage of X in taxation. That gives ME a level of control over my taxes that doesn't exist today.\n \n\n Why? There is no federal law that says you have to have a drivers license. Every state issues drivers licenses, though. There was no federal mandate required to get that rolling, so why should a federal mandate be required to get tort reform passed in the states?\n\n I believe that it has to be a Federal initiative because lawyers would be able to file frivilous lawsuits in states that haven't adopted tort reform. For example, if 49 states passed tort reform that forbid a patient from suing a drug manufacturer, the crafty patient/lawyer could file in the one remaining state that still allowed that sort of lawsuit and circumvent the entire safeguards instituted by Tort Reform in the first place. It only takes one hole in a dike to let water through. \n \n\n And in reality, does tort reform really matter? Sure, we have all heard about the lady who got millions for spilling her Mc Donalds coffe in her lap. This kind of thing is the exception, not the rule, and that was a few paltry millions against revenues in excess fo a billion dollars. \n\n How about the hundreds of billions in lawsuits against tobacco companies?

Do you know what the costs of a class action lawsuit, filed 30 years after a change in regulation can do to a healthy company, even one with liability insurance? I do. I work for a company who had the misfortune of buying another company with skeletons in its closet as a result of ever-changing environmental regulations. What was legal in 1965, for example, resulted in a Multi-Million dollar windfall 30 years later after the rules of the game were changes retroactively.\n \n\n The other problem with trot reform is that it may be unconstitutional.

They may be ruled unconstitutional in the future, in which case, we may have to go the Constitutional Amendment route.\n As for the notion that big companies facing huge class action payouts don't pay any of these costs directly, you're in error. Case in point, one company who was involved in the recent asbestos class action suit paid out $500Million in corporate funds as its share of a total liability of ~$2Billion.

But, if OPEC goes off the dollar and onto the Euro, we're in for some serious long-term trouble.

There is no competitive advantage being gained because those guys who run our companies realise that the whole line of thinking you are laying out here is a bunch of BS feel good economic theory and has no place in an economic strategy.\n\n You paint with too broad of an economic brush. Only parts of the export market are hiking prices. With our biggest trading partner, Canada, the favorable exchange rate between our currencies is a boon to Canadian shoppers in the US and a bust to US shoppers in Canada.\n \n\n This is one of those things that makes me wonder if our entire nation is not descended from retarded apes.

   "I \n Currencies fluctuate all of the time. I'm not ready to play Chicken Little just yet. Why, this year alone, my 401K grew by almost 30%. A couple more years like that and I'll be able to retire young.....relatively speaking.\n\n \n This isn't a new issue, the problem being that the dollar has been in decline for over 30-years. The acceleration of that decline in the past four years due to excessive public debt is the scary factor. \n \n Here's a quick look at the currencies of Japan (Yen) and China (Yuan), the two primary countries that purchase our treasury issues and literally keep us financially afloat:\n \n Dollar to Yen\n 1980- 239.23\n 1990- 128.45\n 2000- 112.75\n now- 104.33\n \n Dollar to Yuan\n 1980- 1.53\n 1990- 5.2323 \n 2000- 8.2768\n Now- 8.2765\n \n Japan floats the Yen, showing the deterioration of the dollar. China, following prudent monetary policy in an economy expanding like a rocket, saw what was happening to the US and does not allow the Yuan to float. \n I don't care if Americans are living on the ground with no shelter, China will not be affected by the declining dollar supposedly allowing more US exports while Japan hedges their US currency losses with expanded markets in - China! Are you getting the picture that a 30% paper increase in US equity assets doesn't mean a whole lot in future value with debt levels that wipe out the purchasing power of that currency when those assets are utilized? Or that tax levels necessary to keep the government solvent when redeemed might be three times current 'tax free' levels? \n \n The single biggest concern for people who have accumulated what looks like a comfortable nest egg should be future, not net present value, based on inflation factors and, now, currency exchange rates.

   "I thank you for the elloquent explanation, but be careful with the \"french socialist\" characterization. It's my handle, but NOT my philosophy. ;) \n\n \n Sorry. Couldn't resist.\n \n \nAgreed. Too many times in our recent past our leaders haven't applied our constitutional principles to international entanglements.\n\n \n This seems to be a problem with far reaching implications. By refusing to apply constitutional principals to our foreign policy, we have ended up supporting dictators and doing some pretty evil things throughout the world. That has brought us international anti american sentiment on a grand scal. \n \n I\n believe that it has to be a Federal initiative because lawyers would be able to file frivilous lawsuits in states that haven't adopted tort reform. For example, if 49 states passed tort reform that forbid a patient from suing a drug manufacturer, the crafty patient/lawyer could file in the one remaining state that still allowed that sort of lawsuit and circumvent the entire safeguards instituted by Tort Reform in the first place. It only takes one hole in a dike to let water through. \n \n \n Only if said crafty patient/lawer were from that state and had conducted business with said company in that state. This is unlikely to be a problem. If 75% of the states enacted tort reforms, you could almost bet that companies would quite doing business in those states. You see this already in some states in regards to gun parts (washinton comes to mind) where posession of \"machine gun parts\" are illegal. Many gun part makers/distributors simply refuse to ship ANY parts or accessories to those states.\n \n \nHow about the hundreds of billions in lawsuits against tobacco companies? Or the cumulative effects of ALL physicians practicing defensive medicine? \n \n \n Hudreds of billions in lawsuits against a companies posting trillions in profits, who had done something wrong, which killed people. Seems a little lopsided to me, in favor of the tobacco companies.\n \n Cases like this, and like the Mc Donalds/hot cofee lawsuit, are generally decided by a jury. 12 people, and at least 9 of them (in most states) were convinced that the actions of the defendant were sufficiently heinous, or sufficiently irresponsible, to warrant these huge settlements. Have you ever sat on the jury in a high stakes lawsuit? I did once, and it changed my viewpoint forever. We handed out a 700 million dollar settlement. Following, people in our state were outraged at the size of the settlement and there was a long round of \"we need laws to protect against settlements like this\". Bull, they werent sitting in the courtroom. I was. My only regret is that we couldn't put the bastards in prison.\n \n \nTort Reform isn't an all or nothing proposition. You can eliminate frivilous lawsuits without removing needed safeguards. \n \n \n But who decides what are needed safegaurds and what are frivilous lawsuits? The same folks who are pushing tort reform (if you follow lobbying money, it quickly becomes apparent that the only people who are really pushing it are big business, especially the insurance companies)? \n \n The most effective tort reform I have seen are laws that allow defendants in lawsuits to countersue the plaintif for their attorneys fees in the event that they (the defendant) wins. These cases run concurrent to the lawsuit in question, so the result of a defendants ruling is a big legal bill for the plantiff (in addition ot their own legal bill). \n \n \nI believe that company officials who break the law should go to jail, not pay huge fines. Do you know what the costs of a class action lawsuit, filed 30 years after a change in regulation can do to a healthy company, even one with liability insurance? I do. I work for a company who had the misfortune of buying another company with skeletons in its closet as a result of ever-changing environmental regulations. What was legal in 1965, for example, resulted in a Multi-Million dollar windfall 30 years later after the rules of the game were changes retroactively.\n\n \n Most company officials who break the law do not even pay fines. The company pays the fines. Nothing happens to the XXXXXX who actually make the decisions.\n \n In your example here, the problem is NOT tort law, the problem is retroactive changes to the rules.\n \n \nYou're only partially right here. They may be ruled unconstitutional in the future, in which case, we may have to go the Constitutional Amendment route.\n\n \n Good luck on that one. If ruled unconstitutional, in order to enact such a constitutional ammendmnet, you would have to repeal one of the articles of the bill of rights. Not likely, especially since, following the supreme courts traditional view that the bill of rights does NOT grant rights, it merely recognises natural rights, it is unlikely that it is even POSSSIBLE to repeal somethig from the bill of rights. A couple of supreme courts have said it absolutly is not.\n \n Are you really willing to do this in any event? By removing the right to trial by jury in the case of lawsuits, and by extension the right of that jusry to assign penalties, you are effectively removing the concept of citizen justice from civil cases. You are OK with this? \n \n \nAs for the notion that big companies facing huge class action payouts don't pay any of these costs directly, you're in error. Case in point, one company who was involved in the recent asbestos class action suit paid out $500Million in corporate funds as its share of a total liability of ~$2Billion. That's \"real money\" paid out by a real company with real effects to its bottom line and future health.\n\n \n Then they were either:\n \n A. Self insured, which means they had enough cash reserves that the $500 million was not that big a deal\n B: uninsured, in whcih case they were XXXXXX and deserve to go out of business.\n \n Most class action suits against asbestos companies are based on the fact that the companies KNEW, ABSOLUTLY KNEW that asbestos was KILLING people and not only did they not say anything, they took pains to hide it from the public so they could continue selling it. For all intents and purposes, they made the decision to kill people for money. If this is the case, and the plantiff can convince a jury of this, they get no sympathy from me when they get hit with a huge lawsuit. I just wish that jury could vote to throw the ****ers who made those decisions in jail.\n \n \nI believe that the biggest portion of our exports are foodstocks. These are US raw materials. We have lost much of our manufacturing base a long time ago. What we export most, aside from food, is knowledge, knowledge in the form of engineering for the most part.\n\n \n The price of food (especially for export) has gone through the roof. This happened when the price of oil went up, since we effectively eat oil. Our exports of \"knowledge\" are next to nil. Service exports (which include not only knowledge but on site consulting, etc....) are in reality less than 15% of our total exports. This is because the Japanese are years ahead of us as far as electronics go, and europe is years ahead of us as far as mechanical and industrial design. \n \n US schools rate pretty close to the bottom in the western world. With our manufacturers going out of business or jumping ship to other countries, and our economy sinking down the tubes as a result, who wants to buy such knowledge? Interestingly enough, the largest export of \"knowledge\" last year was PR and political advisors. Apparently there are leaders and politicians in other countries who would like to learn to lie to their populations or refocus their attention at will from politically unpleasant moves. \n \n \nIt's too soon to say with any degree of certainty. But, if OPEC goes off the dollar and onto the Euro, we're in for some serious long-term trouble. Also, as China grows and competes more in the world market for oil and other natural resources, we could be in for even more problems.\n\n \n It is not so much theri competition for resources that re likely to cause us problems. China has vast reserves of easily exploitable resources, with the excation of oil. They have already made their deal as far as oil goes. They will be purchasing it (with cash) from the russians and piping it in a pipeline that is already under construction. They have already paid down on enough of the russian reserves to keep them running for a couple of decades. \n \n The place we really need to worry about them being competition is as a consumer nation. Currently our status as the world largest consumer market is the ONLY thing keeping our economy afloat. Other nations whose primary exprt trade is the US (Japan, China, Taiwan, etc...) have done about all they can to stabilise the dollar and foat our national debt so we can continue to provide a consumer market for their goods. The minute they have a better market for their goods (one that they DON'T have to prop up in order to keep it afloat) that is about all she wrote for our economy. Without the stabilization efforts of foreign governements for the dollar, it would have delcined nearly 60% this year. The Japanese are already changing output production to meet the demands of the Chinese market as opposed to the American market, and their efforts to stabilise our economy have dropped proportionally. This is not (even close to ) the first year that foreign nations have propped up our economy and our currency in order to keep the Us consumer in the buying game. \n \n Since rougly 200-2001, their intervention has dwindled as they find new markets for their goods and see less and less benifit to propping up US markets. Theis last year, that has accelerated. 2004 saw less intervention than past years as the chinese come on line as consumers and the EU has taken some steps to prove stability (lack of percieved stability in the EU has always been a big negative in counting on EU as a trading partner). \n \n The japanese and chinese governments have already as much as stated that starting next year, they will not be taking steps to stabilise the dollar. Already nations are consolidating their cash reserves (which have traditionally always been held in dollars) and some nations have dumped the dollar as a resaerve currency alltogether.\n \n \nSince we're evolving into a more and more service-oriented economy, one can argue that manufactured goods will play a lesser role in our future economic health.\n\n \n Certainly. We don't manufacture squat, and it will lead to an inevitable breakdown in our economic health. The idealistic scenario where we export \"knowledge\" and don't need to produce anything has ALREADY come crashing down. Didn't you hear the swirling noise as IBM's consultancy business went down the toilet? It joined the efforts of GE, GM, Black and Veatch, and a hundred other companies who really htought they would be able to replace real value goods with knowledge on the owrld market. The new schem for American businesses like GE (I am sure you have seen adds for this on TV) is corporate and commercial financing. Take a look at some of their lending reports. Less than 5% of the comapnies they are lending money to are US companies. What they essentially are doing is sending their cash overseas to protect it form the US economic fall. GE corporate financing just loaned half a billion dollars to FN (belguim arms maker....they make the P-90). One of the stipulations of the loan was that it be repaid in Euros, not dollars. From this we can certainly infer which way the GE thinks the dollar, and the american economy, is going.\n \n I have heard the argumet for \"knowledge\" exports before. I think Rod Eddington (CEO of British Airways) summed it up best. He was asked by an Amercian reporter during a press confrence if his company would be using TWA's consultancy service (Yes, TWA was yet another US compnay with delusions that they may be able to sell their knowlege). His reply was \"Why would we take management advice from a company that relies on constant government bailouts to stay in business?\"\n \n That pretty much sums it up. Why would foreign automakers want to hire US consultants? US automakers are int he unique position of having to bribe theri consumers through use of low or no interest financing in order to get people to buy their product. Why would ANY foreign manufaturer want to hire US consultants? Americans are the only ones who have managed to delude themselves into believeing that our economic and industrial infrastructure are worthy of replicating. The rest of the world has watched it fail miserably, and recognised a miserable failure when they saw one.\n \n \nYou paint with too broad of an economic brush. Only parts of the export market are hiking prices. With our biggest trading partner, Canada, the favorable exchange rate between our currencies is a boon to Canadian shoppers in the US and a bust to US shoppers in Canada.\n\n \n I am missing your point here.\n \n \nCurrencies fluctuate all of the time. I'm not ready to play Chicken Little just yet. Why, this year alone, my 401K grew by almost 30%. A couple more years like that and I'll be able to retire young.....relatively speaking.\n\n \n Your 401K has nothing to do with currency markets. On the subject of your 401K, I have some bad news for you. Taking into account projected tax increases to pay off our current debt, as well as losses in the value of the dollar (nobody that I am aware of is projecting a rise in the dollar any time soon), you lost 13% this year assuming you leave the money in your 401K for another 10 years. \n \n This is the problem with Bushs tax cuts and subsequent increse in deficit spending. I have yet to see a single projection that suggests we will be able to meet our debt obligations without a tax increase. Even guys who are supportive of Bushs policies have admitted that the tax cuts have not spurred real economic output (production) by even 10% of the level needed. The good news is that your 401K money going in is tax free. The bad news is that taxes always go up, and you get to pay the taxes on not onlyt the original moey you put in, but on the money that you made with the 401K. This is why the governemnt has pushed 401K's so hard. If you are the one who gets to collect the taxes, they are a GREAT scam.\n \n Sure, currency fluctuates. If we were just talking fluctuations, there would be nothign to worry about. We are not talking fluctuations. We are talking a 30 years downtrend which has acellerated. Most projections show a cliff at the end of the hill, and we are running for it flat out.",

When I occasionally look at balance sheets of 'hot' issues showing abnormal equity gains or paying above normal dividends (day trader and fund fodder), I usually see booked assets far exceeding actual asset value. I get a particularly good laugh out of heavy goodwill and licenses booked from the acquisitions that make them glamorous. \n \n Do any currently defined conservative investors of tax-deferred equity issues ever stop to consider that their fragile investments are secured by nothing but confidence in the market, easily shattered, not some magic formula?

Factoring in the higer interest rate, and adjustment for inflation, and it is not that difficult to pull 20-30 percent on your money by just parking it.

With the low interest rates in our recent past driving peopel to refinance their homes or take out home equity loans, and traditional down payment requirements being crushed in order for lenders to sell their loans in a competitive market, over 50% of americans have less than 10% equity in their homes.

A far different picture than most brokers pitch, but one way day traders and others make money. For a public company or government entity, their bond rating or commercial paper and comments usually, but not always, paint a clear picture of their financial health. \n \n Back to the conservative topic, most conservatives formerly watched their money, personal and public, very closely. That no longer seems to be the case, regardless of their profession. I know engineers as well as finance people who caught the fund bug because when funds became popular markets were strong and it was hard to deny the employer contribution attractiveness if one took the max. I can remember people saying 'what a relief, now all I have to watch is a couple of numbers'. Even after Black Thursday and the dot.com bust people had gotten into the habit of letting someone else, usually a fund, take care of their money, just as they've let the government think for them. Neither group has what I'd call a stellar long-term record. \n \n Stock and bond traders who know what they're doing make an awful lot of money and seldom take on new clients. Look at any private brokerage structure, its divided into investment levels and you don't walk in the door with anything under way into seven figures and get the best talent working for you. Research provided to the bulk of brokers to make decisions for their clients is where the good brokers private staff gets started on analysis. \n \n For those of you devoted to funds, don't forget Enron, World.com and a slew of others.

In today's politically volatile environment, who can predict economical stability anywhere?\n 5) I live in the US, so catastrophic market occurrences will be hard to escape. The declining dollar will negatively impact my ability to purchase foreign currencies.\n 6) the \"overvalued\" housing market is probably the result of several years of artificially low interest rates. People have borrowed all they can to buy as much home as possible which has created a sellers market. This in turn has driven up the price of all homes. Obviously, this can't go on forever, and those leveraged on floating rates will be hit hardest as rates rise. Basically, we have been subsidizing the housing market, and like all good things, that will inevitably come to an end. Americans have embraced the idea of debt in all facets of their existence, and our government has been the best teacher. I don't know where all the smoke will settle on this point, but I figure as long as people need homes, there will be a demand for them, and I've always been partial to investments that I can see, especially when I can live in one.\n \n Anyway, just a few thoughts.",

Many people, obviously not yourself, still firmly believe that the US is what it was before global market strategy began developing the US as the world's largest consumer market.

Unless one is in a position of income from blue chips, which will survive even losing a world war as proven with German companies, investment timing is everything, and aside from loansharking with Bruno as a collector, nothing is a sure bet. The only criterion for most real investors is cash flow, with equity increases being a plus for future generations. Equity funds such as 401k types generally, at this point, don't have much demand for withdrawals, which gives them breathing room to recoup losses, often hidden in cooked books as is now surfacing with demands for increased regulation. With interest rates so low, property ready to take a big hit and equity markets far overvalued, domestic investment diversification is rapidly coming down to the decision of whether to bury gold or silver.",

Many countries (\"most countries\" would probably be a more honest assesment) are converting their cash reserves at least partially to Euros, and are positioning themselves to ditch the dollar alltogether as a reserve currency in the next decade. \n \n There are two advantages I can see to the Euro as a long term investment. First, due to the diversified nature of the Euro, specifically the fact that it is not tied to any particular nations well being, it is difficult to really envision a series of events (lacking a world war) which is likely to cause massive fluctuation in its value. Second, nations which are taking pains to change their reserve currency to Euros can be counted on to take pains to stabilise the Euro and protect their investment. \n \n The third reason I think the Euro is a good investment right now is that the EU has taken great pains over the last few years to position themselves for growth, even at the expense of current growth numbers (you gotta give it to those folks, they DO think in the long term). By forging trade relationships with third tier nations like Syria, they have gained access to a large pool of semi skilled, well educated, low priced labor, but without the usual difficulties involved in exploiting thrid world workers (rebellions, restrictive trade agreements etc....). \n \n \n5) I live in the US, so catastrophic market occurrences will be hard to escape. The declining dollar will negatively impact my ability to purchase foreign currencies.\n\n \n True enough, but unless you either believe that the dollar is going to recover (doubtful) or are financially savvy enough to pull a high ROI on domestic investments (also dobtful....sorry, but you said yourself above that you are the \"average man on the street\", and the \"Average man on the street\" in America can almost always be counted on to make the wrong decision when it comes to money), there is no better time to transfer away from the weak and droppiung dollar than now.\n \n \n6) the \"overvalued\" housing market is probably the result of several years of artificially low interest rates. People have borrowed all they can to buy as much home as possible which has created a sellers market. This in turn has driven up the price of all homes. Obviously, this can't go on forever, and those leveraged on floating rates will be hit hardest as rates rise. \n \n \n First, interest rates have not been artificially low. The fed dropped them to the point they needed to be dropped in order to get the desired result. In reality, they did NOT get the desired result, but taking interest rates any lower would have driven many banks out of business. Now we are raising rates as a necessity in order keep pushing our treasury issue, not as a method of cntrolling growth. \n \n \nBasically, we have been subsidizing the housing market, and like all good things, that will inevitably come to an end. Americans have embraced the idea of debt in all facets of their existence, and our government has been the best teacher.\n \n \n True enough.\n \n \nI don't know where all the smoke will settle on this point, but I figure as long as people need homes, there will be a demand for them, and I've always been partial to investments that I can see, especially when I can live in one.\n\n \n \n COME ON. Are you from Lenexa or not? Don't you remember the Ag land crash of the early 80's? Everybody was saying the same thing \"the bottom can't fall out of the market. Land is a secure investment......they're not making it anymore\". Six months of enduring those stupid jokes and the bottom fell out of the market. Land that had been selling for $2500 and acre was selling for $200 an acre. Those who saw it coming sold at $2500 and acre then re-bought the land at $200 and acre a year later. Now average price for Ag acerage isn KS is about $800. \n \n As a local example of out of control house prices, 6 years ago I built 10 houses by 135th and Antioch to use as furnished corporate leases (Sprint). I paid $83,000 each for the site and their construction, then another $20,000 each to funish them. Part of Sprints lease was a replacement of all furnishings at the end of the lease period (which was this year). They replaced the furnishings with nice stuff (the original stuff was nice stuff, too), but not extravagent by any means. Last week I signed the papers on the last of them. It sold for $235,000.00. In reality, adjusted for inflation, and with all the furnishings, it should have gone for about $95,000.00. The Johnson county real estate market is just SO overpriced that people are spending rediculous amounts of money on relatively cheap housing (my father owns one of the larger residential consturction companies in Ks, trust me, most of the new housing in JoCo is cheap junk).\n \n If you get on 69 hwy and head towards the arboretum (sp?), keep a sharp lookout on the right side of the highway fro the 2 signs announcing Rodrocks new developments. I will save you the trouble. They are gone. They took them down last month. Even Darol Rodrock, who is hands down the largest developer in the Kansas City area, is pulling out of the Johnson County market. It appears that the project at the old peterson ranch (there by shawnee mission park) will likely be his last major project until after the bubble bursts. \n \n Sure, people are always going to need housing. The wuestion is, who gets caught holding the bag when the market crashes? I know it won't be me. \n \n If I were you, I would be especially careful to hedge, living in Johnson County. I know that for years tehy have been telling you that you have some of the best values in housing in the country. This is a flat out lie. Three rules of real estate....Location, Location, location. the fact that a nice 4 bedroom house costs a million bucks in Miami has nothing to do with the vaslue of one in Johnson County, Ks. People actually WANT to live in Flordia, and the minimum wage in the Miami area is around 11 bucks, so a yuppie in Miami can afford to shell out a million bux for a 4 bedroom cookie cutter house. \n \n In the last several years I have put in 3 500+ house developments down by old stanley (now annexed by Overland park). they re like licenses to print money. You can't build them fast enough. Bad news for the JoCo homebuyer, though. We (JoCo developers) know we are selling you cheap junk at inflated prices. We like it that way, and will continue to stagger output to ensure that the \"housing shortage\" (what a joke) continues.",

   "Put the LLC together to hold irrevocable trust fixed assets and a smattering of negotiable securities such as stocks and bonds, another LLC to hold the trust LLC for purposes of trust management fees and do your liquid deposits into a separate, offshore LLC. Most offshore financial institutions will then issue credit cards secured by the deposits, using interest paid to the LLC to pay charges in a different country. Your domestic K filings show little, if any taxable income. That's the reason IRS was after international divisions of VISA and MC to allow them access to real time offshore transaction records.

Right, the 1040EZ forms will be revised.\n\n \n \n The traditional down side to offshore banking, atrocious credit card fees ($15 ATM transfer fees, $4 transaction fee for all other purchase, etc...), has even been rectified.\n \n As offshore banks began to recognise that many of the Americans who were inquiring about their services were not criminals looking to hide funds, but instead well to do Americans who were looking for a place that offered better interest than the local cap fed, and a currency that offers a little more stability than the dollar, their offers became mroe competitive. Apparently they saw an advantage to having Americans opening long term accounts. \n \n The latest set of Debit cards I got from my offshore bank have a $0 cash advace transaction fee, and a $0 regular transaction fee.

   "What Became of Conservatives?\n \n by Paul Craig Roberts\n \n I remember when friends would excitedly telephone to report that Rush Limbaugh or G. Gordon Liddy had just read one of my syndicated columns over the air. That was before I became a critic of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration, and the neoconservative ideologues who have seized control of the U.S. government.\n \n There was a time when I could rant about the \"liberal media\" with the best of them. But in recent years I have puzzled over the precise location of the \"liberal media.\"\n \n Not so long ago, I would have identified the liberal media as the New York Times and Washington Post, CNN and the three TV networks, and National Public Radio. But both the Times and the Post fell for the Bush administration's lies about WMD and supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq. On balance, CNN, the networks, and NPR have not made an issue of the Bush administration's changing explanations for the invasion.\n \n In the ranks of the new conservatives, however, I see and experience much hate. It comes to me in violently worded, ignorant, and irrational e-mails from self-professed conservatives who literally worship George Bush. Even Christians have fallen into idolatry. There appears to be a large number of Americans who are prepared to kill anyone for George Bush.\n \n Delusion is still the defining characteristic of the Bush administration. We have smashed Fallujah, a city of 300,000, only to discover that the 10,000 U.S. Marines are bogged down in the ruins of the city. If the Marines leave, the \"defeated\" insurgents will return. Meanwhile, the insurgents have moved on to destabilize Mosul, a city five times as large. Thus, the call for more U.S. troops.\n \n There are no more troops. Our former allies are not going to send troops. The only way the Bush administration can continue with its Iraq policy is to reinstate the draft.\n \n When the draft is reinstated, conservatives will loudly proclaim their pride that their sons, fathers, husbands, and brothers are going to die for \"our freedom.\" Not a single one of them will be able to explain why destroying Iraqi cities and occupying the ruins are necessary for \"our freedom.\"\n \n Full article:\n \n http://www.antiwar.com/roberts/?articleid=4056\n \n \n Related Threads:\n \n How to Identify Neoconservatives\n \n Pat Buchanan's New Book Blasts Neocons\n \n Bush and Neocons Planned \"Regime Change\" Before 9/11\n \n \n \n .\n\n \n Pat Buchanan is one of the last prominent \"real conservatives\" left. Unfortunately, the media has managed to marginalize him, because he had the audacity to refer to the \"Amen corner of Israel in congress\", a comment that was nothing more than the truth. The fact is that many of our problems today are because of our blind support of Israel, no matter what they do. Israel is a country that routinely spies on us, has attacked a ship of ours, tried to kill all survivors to cover it up, resorts to storm trouper tactics, and pressures and blackmails many of our politicians. Bush has sold out, as have most other conservatives and liberals, when it comes to equal treatment of the mid-east problems. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of blame to go around. It takes two to tango, but perhaps we should withdraw our troups, and let them fight it out to the death, letting God or Allah sort it out.",

Now we are raising rates as a necessity in order keep pushing our treasury issue, not as a method of cntrolling growth. \n\n \n Actually, let me define more clearly what I meant. The historically low interest rates allowed home buyers the opportunity to \"super-size\" their home purchase by increasing the principal portion of the payment directly in relation to the savings in the interest rate. Homes that would have never been affordable at 8-12% interest were possible at 4-5%. Granted, the job growth never materialized, but consumers lucky enough to have a job probably talked themselves into up-sizing. After all, if someone's gonna lend you money at 4-5%, you can't afford to pay cash.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCOME ON. Are you from Lenexa or not? Don't you remember the Ag land crash of the early 80's?

I quit buying the properties in the mid 90's when values started to exceed earning potential and have always considered the appreciation to be a mixed blessing. I don't harbor any misconceptions about the local housing market. I work here, and therefore I live here. I bought my house in the early 80's, and the good news is the value has nearly doubled. The bad news is the county uses that value to figure my property taxes and I'd have to spend appreciably more than that to buy anything better.

   "This isn't a new issue, the problem being that the dollar has been in decline for over 30-years. The acceleration of that decline in the past four years due to excessive public debt is the scary factor. \n \n Here's a quick look at the currencies of Japan (Yen) and China (Yuan), the two primary countries that purchase our treasury issues and literally keep us financially afloat:\n \n Dollar to Yen\n 1980- 239.23\n 1990- 128.45\n 2000- 112.75\n now- 104.33\n \n Dollar to Yuan\n 1980- 1.53\n 1990- 5.2323 \n 2000- 8.2768\n Now- 8.2765\n \n Japan floats the Yen, showing the deterioration of the dollar. China, following prudent monetary policy in an economy expanding like a rocket, saw what was happening to the US and does not allow the Yuan to float. \n I don't care if Americans are living on the ground with no shelter, China will not be affected by the declining dollar supposedly allowing more US exports while Japan hedges their US currency losses with expanded markets in - China! Are you getting the picture that a 30% paper increase in US equity assets doesn't mean a whole lot in future value with debt levels that wipe out the purchasing power of that currency when those assets are utilized? Or that tax levels necessary to keep the government solvent when redeemed might be three times current 'tax free' levels? \n\n The US has invested heavily in China, especially in the auto industry. That is one area in which Japan is trailing Europe and the US badly. Of over 4Million cars made in China, only ~500k have been partially Japanese-based vehicles. The predominant number have been German and US joint ventures and the numbers are growing rapidly. China's car production will exceed the US' in 20 years and it's mainly US and EU companies that will benefit from the huge growth.\n \n\n The single biggest concern for people who have accumulated what looks like a comfortable nest egg should be future, not net present value, based on inflation factors and, now, currency exchange rates. Traditional conservatives are mostly long-gone because the government has stated they're taking care of everyone and people actually believe that load of fertilizer.\n\n \n My portfolio isn't just filled with US stocks; it has a significant International content. I'd be a fool to put all of my nest eggs in one basket. :)",

   "\n This seems to be a problem with far reaching implications. By refusing to apply constitutional principals to our foreign policy, we have ended up supporting dictators and doing some pretty evil things throughout the world. That has brought us international anti american sentiment on a grand scal. \n \n\n No argument there. Our foreign policy has been schizophrenic at best. \n \n\n Only if said crafty patient/lawer were from that state and had conducted business with said company in that state. This is unlikely to be a problem. If 75% of the states enacted tort reforms, you could almost bet that companies would quite doing business in those states. You see this already in some states in regards to gun parts (washinton comes to mind) where posession of \"machine gun parts\" are illegal. Many gun part makers/distributors simply refuse to ship ANY parts or accessories to those states.\n\n Come on now, you don't really think that companies could refuse to do business in some states, do you? Let's say your a big pharmaseutical company that just came up with THE CURE. You sell it to anybody that can afford it, regardless of where they live. THAT makes you vulnerable to a lawsuit from one of the non-tort reform states. It's not feasible to exclude sales in targeted states. What if you did and patient X crossed into state Y to buy his drugs, but lived in state Z? You'd be screwed. \n \n\n Hudreds of billions in lawsuits against a companies posting trillions in profits, who had done something wrong, which killed people. Seems a little lopsided to me, in favor of the tobacco companies.\n\n Tobacco warnings have been on cigarette packs for 40 years. Anyone who claims that they didn't know it was hazardous to their health is an XXX. Period.\n Do we allow lawsuits to procede against alcohol manufacturers? After all, drunken drivers and alcoholics themselves die in record numbers as a result of their products. We could also make the same claim against McDonald's greasy Big Macs. Where does personal responsibility begin and adsurd transference of blame end with you? \n \n\n Cases like this, and like the Mc Donalds/hot cofee lawsuit, are generally decided by a jury. 12 people, and at least 9 of them (in most states) were convinced that the actions of the defendant were sufficiently heinous, or sufficiently irresponsible, to warrant these huge settlements. Have you ever sat on the jury in a high stakes lawsuit? I did once, and it changed my viewpoint forever. We handed out a 700 million dollar settlement. Following, people in our state were outraged at the size of the settlement and there was a long round of \"we need laws to protect against settlements like this\". Bull, they werent sitting in the courtroom. I was. My only regret is that we couldn't put the bastards in prison.\n\n Need I remind you that 12 jurors found OJ not guilty despite a pile of DNA and other irrefutable evidence? Surely you aren't claiming that juries are infallable, are you?\n As for your particular trial, if their actions were unlawful, then they should go to jail, not force their stockholders to lose everything that they have invested. What justice is served by decreasing shareholder value by $700Million? Throw the guilty corporate officiers in jail instead. \n \n\n But who decides what are needed safegaurds and what are frivilous lawsuits? The same folks who are pushing tort reform (if you follow lobbying money, it quickly becomes apparent that the only people who are really pushing it are big business, especially the insurance companies)? \n\n And the obverse is true. Those preventing reform are trial lawyers who prey on those companies. I'm more inclined to try to keep industries healthy more than I am to keep trial lawyers rich. \n \n\n The most effective tort reform I have seen are laws that allow defendants in lawsuits to countersue the plaintif for their attorneys fees in the event that they (the defendant) wins. These cases run concurrent to the lawsuit in question, so the result of a defendants ruling is a big legal bill for the plantiff (in addition ot their own legal bill). \n\n Couple that with the removal of \"contingency\" lawsuits and you might have something. Nobody suing another person should be able to do so for free or on speculation.\n \n\n Most company officials who break the law do not even pay fines. The company pays the fines. Nothing happens to the XXXXXX who actually make the decisions.\n\n I don't know if I'd say \"most\", but certainly some.\n \n\n In your example here, the problem is NOT tort law, the problem is retroactive changes to the rules.\n\n Actually, it's both. If ridiculous damages weren't allowed, then the changing of the rules retroactively wouldn't have any effect.\n \n\n Good luck on that one. If ruled unconstitutional, in order to enact such a constitutional ammendmnet, you would have to repeal one of the articles of the bill of rights. Not likely, especially since, following the supreme courts traditional view that the bill of rights does NOT grant rights, it merely recognises natural rights, it is unlikely that it is even POSSSIBLE to repeal somethig from the bill of rights. A couple of supreme courts have said it absolutly is not.\n\n There are many ways to skin a cat. Just look at how effective the anti-gun fanatics have become and the Second Amendment is still law as far as I know. \n \n\n Are you really willing to do this in any event? By removing the right to trial by jury in the case of lawsuits, and by extension the right of that jusry to assign penalties, you are effectively removing the concept of citizen justice from civil cases. You are OK with this? \n\n I don't see limiting damages as being unconstitutional. Every state has a small claims limit, for example, and all are constitutional. As for removing the right to trial by jury, judges make that call daily now. They are obligated to prevent frivilous lawsuits. The problem is that they don't exercise their power nearly enough. They cop out and let a jury decide if a case has merit and that's not a jury's decision to make. Grand jury and judges are charged with that responsibility.\n \n\n Then they were either:\n \n A. Self insured, which means they had enough cash reserves that the $500 million was not that big a deal\n B: uninsured, in whcih case they were XXXXXX and deserve to go out of business.\n\n Neither. They were required to put up a portion of the settlement money from their own funds. Insurance covered those claims in excess of the companies payout.\n \n\n Most class action suits against asbestos companies are based on the fact that the companies KNEW, ABSOLUTLY KNEW that asbestos was KILLING people and not only did they not say anything, they took pains to hide it from the public so they could continue selling it. For all intents and purposes, they made the decision to kill people for money. If this is the case, and the plantiff can convince a jury of this, they get no sympathy from me when they get hit with a huge lawsuit. I just wish that jury could vote to throw the ****ers who made those decisions in jail.\n\n Asbestos is another example of retroactive laws being applied with grave consequences. The dangers of asbestos were found long after the first \"victims\" were exposed, but ALL victims could join in the lawsuit. So, while you could make a case that selling asbestos AFTER the health consequences were found, I think that alowing victims exposed prior to that time to sue is wrong.\n \n\n The price of food (especially for export) has gone through the roof. This happened when the price of oil went up, since we effectively eat oil. Our exports of \"knowledge\" are next to nil. Service exports (which include not only knowledge but on site consulting, etc....) are in reality less than 15% of our total exports. This is because the Japanese are years ahead of us as far as electronics go, and europe is years ahead of us as far as mechanical and industrial design. \n\n My area of expertise is in the auto industry and Japan is trailing badly in investment in China. China will be the savior of the US auto industry over the next generation. As China's economy grows, so does their thirst for US goods and services. I read somewher that the biggest auto imports INTO China were luxury cars.\n \n\n US schools rate pretty close to the bottom in the western world. With our manufacturers going out of business or jumping ship to other countries, and our economy sinking down the tubes as a result, who wants to buy such knowledge? Interestingly enough, the largest export of \"knowledge\" last year was PR and political advisors. Apparently there are leaders and politicians in other countries who would like to learn to lie to their populations or refocus their attention at will from politically unpleasant moves.\n\n While our grammar schools and high schools may be close to the bottom in the western world, our colleges and universities are the best in the world. I've spoken with many international colleagues, particularly Germans, who stated that if a person was really serious about his science, he went to grad school in the US. Unfortunately, most of those grad schools are populated with foreigners taking that advice.\n \n\n It is not so much theri competition for resources that re likely to cause us problems. China has vast reserves of easily exploitable resources, with the excation of oil. They have already made their deal as far as oil goes. They will be purchasing it (with cash) from the russians and piping it in a pipeline that is already under construction. They have already paid down on enough of the russian reserves to keep them running for a couple of decades. \n\n Russia doesn't have enough available oil to quench China's growing appetite. \n \n\n The place we really need to worry about them being competition is as a consumer nation. Currently our status as the world largest consumer market is the ONLY thing keeping our economy afloat. Other nations whose primary exprt trade is the US (Japan, China, Taiwan, etc...) have done about all they can to stabilise the dollar and foat our national debt so we can continue to provide a consumer market for their goods. The minute they have a better market for their goods (one that they DON'T have to prop up in order to keep it afloat) that is about all she wrote for our economy. Without the stabilization efforts of foreign governements for the dollar, it would have delcined nearly 60% this year. The Japanese are already changing output production to meet the demands of the Chinese market as opposed to the American market, and their efforts to stabilise our economy have dropped proportionally. This is not (even close to ) the first year that foreign nations have propped up our economy and our currency in order to keep the Us consumer in the buying game. \n \n Since rougly 200-2001, their intervention has dwindled as they find new markets for their goods and see less and less benifit to propping up US markets. Theis last year, that has accelerated. 2004 saw less intervention than past years as the chinese come on line as consumers and the EU has taken some steps to prove stability (lack of percieved stability in the EU has always been a big negative in counting on EU as a trading partner). \n \n The japanese and chinese governments have already as much as stated that starting next year, they will not be taking steps to stabilise the dollar. Already nations are consolidating their cash reserves (which have traditionally always been held in dollars) and some nations have dumped the dollar as a resaerve currency alltogether.\n \n \n \n Certainly. We don't manufacture squat, and it will lead to an inevitable breakdown in our economic health. The idealistic scenario where we export \"knowledge\" and don't need to produce anything has ALREADY come crashing down. Didn't you hear the swirling noise as IBM's consultancy business went down the toilet? It joined the efforts of GE, GM, Black and Veatch, and a hundred other companies who really htought they would be able to replace real value goods with knowledge on the owrld market. The new schem for American businesses like GE (I am sure you have seen adds for this on TV) is corporate and commercial financing. Take a look at some of their lending reports. Less than 5% of the comapnies they are lending money to are US companies. What they essentially are doing is sending their cash overseas to protect it form the US economic fall. GE corporate financing just loaned half a billion dollars to FN (belguim arms maker....they make the P-90). One of the stipulations of the loan was that it be repaid in Euros, not dollars. From this we can certainly infer which way the GE thinks the dollar, and the american economy, is going.\n \n I have heard the argumet for \"knowledge\" exports before. I think Rod Eddington (CEO of British Airways) summed it up best. He was asked by an Amercian reporter during a press confrence if his company would be using TWA's consultancy service (Yes, TWA was yet another US compnay with delusions that they may be able to sell their knowlege). His reply was \"Why would we take management advice from a company that relies on constant government bailouts to stay in business?\"\n \n That pretty much sums it up. Why would foreign automakers want to hire US consultants? US automakers are int he unique position of having to bribe theri consumers through use of low or no interest financing in order to get people to buy their product. Why would ANY foreign manufaturer want to hire US consultants? Americans are the only ones who have managed to delude themselves into believeing that our economic and industrial infrastructure are worthy of replicating. The rest of the world has watched it fail miserably, and recognised a miserable failure when they saw one.\n\n \n As I've stated above, my area of expertise is in the auto industry. We don't have to make cars for China in the US and export them. We own a piece of China's auto market and it is growing daily. You'd be surprised at how much US money is funding Chinese industry. And do you think we're not doing it to make a profit? 80% of Chinese auto customers pay CASH for their cars right now. Imagine the cash flow from that alone.\n \n\n I am missing your point here.\n\n With a strong Canadian dollar, more Canadians are coming into the US to shop. Living near the border, I see an ever-increasing number of Canadian license plates in the mall parking lots. Unfortunately, since we buy more oil from Canada than any other country, the trade balance is lopsided.\n \n\n Your 401K has nothing to do with currency markets. On the subject of your 401K, I have some bad news for you. Taking into account projected tax increases to pay off our current debt, as well as losses in the value of the dollar (nobody that I am aware of is projecting a rise in the dollar any time soon), you lost 13% this year assuming you leave the money in your 401K for another 10 years. \n\n I heard doom and gloom scenarios far worse just before the Republicans took over Congress in the 1994 election. Within two years, they were talking about how to spend the large surplus. Our national debt as a % of GDP is far less than the average US citizen's personal debt and, I don't know about you, but I'm far from going belly up. \n \n\n This is the problem with Bushs tax cuts and subsequent increse in deficit spending. I have yet to see a single projection that suggests we will be able to meet our debt obligations without a tax increase. Even guys who are supportive of Bushs policies have admitted that the tax cuts have not spurred real economic output (production) by even 10% of the level needed. The good news is that your 401K money going in is tax free. The bad news is that taxes always go up, and you get to pay the taxes on not onlyt the original moey you put in, but on the money that you made with the 401K. This is why the governemnt has pushed 401K's so hard. If you are the one who gets to collect the taxes, they are a GREAT scam.\n\n If it wasn't for 9-11, we'd be in a very healthy economy and money would be flowing like water. As a result, our stock market tanked and we spent $Hundreds of Billion in military-related expenditures, but these are temporary abberations, not permanent trends IMO.\n \n\n Sure, currency fluctuates. If we were just talking fluctuations, there would be nothign to worry about. We are not talking fluctuations. We are talking a 30 years downtrend which has acellerated. Most projections show a cliff at the end of the hill, and we are running for it flat out.\n\n Americans, and particularly American businesses, are resourceful. We adapt to changing business climates. If the money's in the EU, we'll nvest there. If it's in China, we'll invest there. If it's on the Moon, we'll invest there. As long as the US has real wealth, which it does, we will survive despite the doom and gloomers.",

   "On the subject of 401K's, I would say that the single biggest factor in accumulating wealth is time. Allowing the maximal amount of your investments to stay sheltered from taxation for the longest time seems to be better than paying your taxes up front and compounding a smaller number. Since none of us have a crystal ball as to what the tax structure will be in 10 years, 20 years, or beyond, I'm comfortable deferring all the income I can to some future date and using the maximal amount today to compound itself at even a modest rate. Once you pay it, it's gone forever, why not work it as long as possible?\n\n \n It's hard to lose money in a 401K when your employer matches your contributions at a 50-120% rate up to 6% of your income.",

   "Put the LLC together to hold irrevocable trust fixed assets and a smattering of negotiable securities such as stocks and bonds, another LLC to hold the trust LLC for purposes of trust management fees and do your liquid deposits into a separate, offshore LLC. Most offshore financial institutions will then issue credit cards secured by the deposits, using interest paid to the LLC to pay charges in a different country. Your domestic K filings show little, if any taxable income. That's the reason IRS was after international divisions of VISA and MC to allow them access to real time offshore transaction records.

   "Actually, let me define more clearly what I meant. The historically low interest rates allowed home buyers the opportunity to \"super-size\" their home purchase by increasing the principal portion of the payment directly in relation to the savings in the interest rate. Homes that would have never been affordable at 8-12% interest were possible at 4-5%. Granted, the job growth never materialized, but consumers lucky enough to have a job probably talked themselves into up-sizing. After all, if someone's gonna lend you money at 4-5%, you can't afford to pay cash.\n\n \n Ok, I see waht you are saying now. Absolutly correct. Add the new \"interest only\" home loans to this (which have by all accounts been wildly sucessful) and it seems that you have a LOT of folks out there living in homes they cannot really afford. Most people who went the \"interest only\" route tied themselves to homes that they can only afford to pay the interest on, and only at the low rates we have seen in the last year. These are variable rate loans. What kind of crack are these people smoking?\n \n \n \nI agree with everything your saying about the local market. I don't invest in land, I invest in income producing properties, more specifically, residential rentals. I quit buying the properties in the mid 90's when values started to exceed earning potential and have always considered the appreciation to be a mixed blessing. I don't harbor any misconceptions about the local housing market. I work here, and therefore I live here. I bought my house in the early 80's, and the good news is the value has nearly doubled. The bad news is the county uses that value to figure my property taxes and I'd have to spend appreciably more than that to buy anything better. \n \n \n The real estate market in Johnson County absolutly amazes me. It is so far out of whack with surrounding markets that it is just incredible. I attribute this to two things. First, when sprint moved basically their entire management structure to Overland Park, they brought in a LOT of people from all over the country, mostly the East and West coasts. On the east or West coast, housing costs are high. They (the new folks) showed up on the scene and rather than actually doing some market research regarding home values in the area, they just grabbed whatever agent they could find and headed out to look at properties. These were folks who were used to paying more for housing than the Kansas real estate market usually demands, and their foolishness, coupled with the fact that there were so many of them all house shopping in such a short time frame, drove prices up significantly. \n \n The other reason I see for the incredibly overpriced real estate market in Johnson county is the idiot yuppie scum who live there. All those soccer moms bopping around int heir SUVs. Women whose stupidity is only exceeded by the stupidity of their husbands. A lot of the real estate market there, and in large part the automobile market and many of the other consumer markets, are dirven by the compulsion for every more impressive status symbols. I have never seen anything quite like it anywhere else in the country. I talk to the employees of my dads construction company who say that it is not at ALL uncommon to go back to repair something on a home and find 2 new cars in the drive way of a $250,000.00 house. They go inside and the living room sports a 42\" plasma screen TV. Go upstairs and you find that they are sleeping on an air matress and their clothes are stacked in cardboard boxes. Kitchen cabinets are full of ramen noodles and tuna fish. They spend all their money on new cars (unquestionably the worst investment you can make), and overvalued house, then can't afford food and furnishings beyond what is absolutly necessary to impress the neiborghs. It is pathetic.\n \n \nAs for the quality of workmanship in today's homes, let's just say the goal is quantity not quality with respect to square footage. Bigger is better.\n\n \n Yep. I got a crash course this year in how low construction standards have sunk. My fatehr had a heart attack and I went up there for a few days to get his companies in order and make sure everything was running smoothly. There were a couple of problems with the construction company and I went out to a job site to meet with a foreman that has worked for dad for 20+ years (I wanted to pull him back into the office for a couple weeks to run things). As I wandered around what was to become a million dollar house, I was struck by the shoddy quality of the work. By the time I found the guy, I was ready to fire him. I thought \"surely dad doesn't know what is going on here\". When I pointed out that, with the quality of workmanship involved, I would not let my dog live in that house, he was rather indignant. he said \"you go take a look around at some of these other houses. We cut a lot of corners, sure, but we build the best houses in the city\". \n \n Long story short, I went and looked aorund, and he was aboslutly correct. MY BARN is better constructed than the houses in JoCo that are selling for a million plus dollars. I shudder to think what kind of house somebody who can only afford a couple hundred thousand gets. \n \n The upside is they DO LOOK GOOD from the street, if you are moving fast enough and happen to like cookie cutter houses.",

   "Come on now, you don't really think that companies could refuse to do business in some states, do you? Let's say your a big pharmaseutical company that just came up with THE CURE. You sell it to anybody that can afford it, regardless of where they live. THAT makes you vulnerable to a lawsuit from one of the non-tort reform states. It's not feasible to exclude sales in targeted states. What if you did and patient X crossed into state Y to buy his drugs, but lived in state Z? You'd be screwed. \n\n \n But they already do. Check out how many manufaturers of gun parts/accessories prohibit their dealers as part of their purchase agreements from shipping any parts or accesories to washington state, new york, and in many cases even california. \n \n You can bet that the first time a drug company that comes up with \"the cure\" and refuses to sell it in states with no tort laws, you WILL SEE tort laws.\n \n \nTobacco warnings have been on cigarette packs for 40 years. Anyone who claims that they didn't know it was hazardous to their health is an XXX. Period.\n Do we allow lawsuits to procede against alcohol manufacturers? After all, drunken drivers and alcoholics themselves die in record numbers as a result of their products. We could also make the same claim against McDonald's greasy Big Macs. Where does personal responsibility begin and adsurd transference of blame end with you? \n \n \n According to the constitution, that is for a jury to decide. \n \n \nNeed I remind you that 12 jurors found OJ not guilty despite a pile of DNA and other irrefutable evidence? Surely you aren't claiming that juries are infallable, are you?\n\n \n Nope, but either you have citizen justice, where people from society as a whole are activley involved in the legal system, and thust are given the opportunity to influence the kind of society they live in, or you don't. End of story. That is ultimatly the question. I vote for citizen justice. \n \n \nAs for your particular trial, if their actions were unlawful, then they should go to jail, not force their stockholders to lose everything that they have invested. What justice is served by decreasing shareholder value by $700Million? Throw the guilty corporate officiers in jail instead. \n \n \n One of the \"advantages\" of the burecratic system is lack of accountability. This is why we rarely see individual responsibility in such cases. It is almost impossible in a company if any size to actually pin down who made any one particular, catastrophic decision, at any particular time. I have trouble doing htis in my own company, and It is fairly small. They generally can't track such things internally, much less in a JD probe. Memos fly back and forth adn ideas evolve and that is that.\n \n Screw the stockholder. The stockmartket is fraught with risk. If the stock holders were worht anything, they would have jumped ship at the initial litigation, punishing the company even more.\n \n \nAnd the obverse is true. Those preventing reform are trial lawyers who prey on those companies. I'm more inclined to try to keep industries healthy more than I am to keep trial lawyers rich. \n \n \n Actually the problem with tort reform is that in every poll I have seen, Americans put it WAY at the bottom of their priority lists. Tehre are just more important things to think about. The only reason it is an issue at all is the billions in PR and lobbying money that has been spent on it. This is similar to \"campaign finance reform\". At the height of the finance reform argument, less than 2% of americans rated it as \"a concern\". It was on the new every night, though. It wasn't until after the act was passed and revealed for what it really was, an incumbet protection law which virtually assured a two part monopoly in the US for the forseeable future, that the public cared at all, and even after that the number was still less than 10%. And you think there is some chance of getting a contitutional ammendment passed regarding this?\n \n \nI don't know if I'd say \"most\", but certainly some.\n\n \n Most. Anybody worth their salt has legal protection built into their contract. The only time it costs corporate officers personally is in the even of criminal prosecution, which is in most states exempted from such agreements by statute.\n \n \nThere are many ways to skin a cat. Just look at how effective the anti-gun fanatics have become and the Second Amendment is still law as far as I know. \n \n \n Yes, but there is not already a plain language supreme court ruling directly contrary to their argument. \n \n \nI don't see limiting damages as being unconstitutional. Every state has a small claims limit, for example, and all are constitutional. As for removing the right to trial by jury, judges make that call daily now. They are obligated to prevent frivilous lawsuits. The problem is that they don't exercise their power nearly enough. They cop out and let a jury decide if a case has merit and that's not a jury's decision to make. Grand jury and judges are charged with that responsibility.\n\n \n Whether an item ends up in small claims court is entirely at the discression of the plaintiff. \n \n Dismissing a lawsuit for cause before the trial is not quite the same as denying the right to a trial by jury.\n \n \nNeither. They were required to put up a portion of the settlement money from their own funds. Insurance covered those claims in excess of the companies payout.\n\n \n Yes, whihc they deducted from their taxes. This would be another good step to holding companies accountable. make legal settlement payouts non tax deductible, and exempt them from bankrupcy proceedings.\n \n \nAsbestos is another example of retroactive laws being applied with grave consequences. The dangers of asbestos were found long after the first \"victims\" were exposed, but ALL victims could join in the lawsuit. So, while you could make a case that selling asbestos AFTER the health consequences were found, I think that alowing victims exposed prior to that time to sue is wrong.\n\n \n This is a decision that was made by the judge, and the defendant in the class action suits. It was cheaper for the defandats to do it this way. the amounts of money involved in class action lawsuits sounds incredibly high, but when you consider actual individual payout amounts and cost of defending the suit, they are cheap.\n \n Shortly after sprint moved their international headquarters to Overlan Park, Ks, they cam under fore for their billing practices. The problem affected thousands of customers and they were projecting liabilities in excess of a billion dollars for direct damages assuming that half the affected people filed suit (probably a low number all things considered). They fought a few cases in different courts, which ended up establishing case law against them. \n \n Some genius in their legal department dropped a line to a local attorney about the cases, including a list of affested parties. THe attorney got a class action case up against sprint, Sprint lost, and ended up paying $350 million. Everybody involved in the class action got a check for a few hundred bucks, the lawyer who set the thing up got abig check, and the folks who were dumb enough to sign on to the class action lawsuit signed away their right to sue on their own.\n \n After the cases of folks who refused to sign were settled, the total cost to sprint was close to $400 million. Local politicians and the local republican party latched onto this \"Huge settlement\" as proof that tort refoms were needed. It was not until a small local paper published an article pointing out that sprint has orchastrated the lawsuit against themselves, and it actually saved them a BILLION dollars when they KNEW they were wrong that the \"we need tort reforms\" folks shut up. Tort law is meant to punish companies who knowingly do wrong. People hear about 200 and 300 million dollar suits, or even billion dollar suits, and are up in arms with it. These are generally folks who have absolutly no concept of the money theya re talking about. Is $400 million a lot of money to you? Yes. Is $400 million a lot of money to a company like sprint? NO. They have over a trillion dollars in liquid or semi liquid assets. When ther BILLION dollar super ATM based voice/data/internet project crashed and burned, they shrugged and walked away. No big deal. $400 million is less than they spend yearly on toilet paper and paper clips.\n \n Have you ever worked in upper management at a large company? If not, I can see how you would be outraged at these \"huge\" lawsuits. If so, you should know better, and frankly you are just trying to screw the little man and remove corporate responsibility and I think very little of you as a man for it. \n \n \nMy area of expertise is in the auto industry and Japan is trailing badly in investment in China. China will be the savior of the US auto industry over the next generation. As China's economy grows, so does their thirst for US goods and services. I read somewher that the biggest auto imports INTO China were luxury cars.\n\n \n Yes, with Lexus, Jaguar, and mercedes leading the curve. The japanese have already made their deal as far as the chinese auto industry goes. They have tariff free imports, by treaty, forever. American automobiles imports are certainly not tariff free. American auto makers can't sell their junk here. People are buying hondas and toyotas from japan, and still doing just fine on them despite the fact that it costs thousands to ship them here. To ship a car from Japan to China costs less than $100. To ship the same car from the US to china costs over $3000, and then they get hit with a 25% tariff (future, currently it is higher, it is expected to drop to 25% by 2006) before they are even allowed off the boat.\n \n Current trends in luxury automobiles in china are based on their current wealth distrobution. your average chinese family CANNOT afford a new car, much less a luxury car. the japanese are waiting to gear up production for the chinese market until there is a big enough market base for their product to justify expenditures. They have also forged alliances with chinese comapnies, to the tune of 30% ownership of chinas domestic auto comanies which American automakers have been prohibited from doing on anywhere near that scale. Currently there are 115 automobile manufacturers, 525 installation and changing manufacturers and 10 motor manufacturers in china, and the chinese governemtn has already publicly stated that they will take any measures necessary to protect their domestic manufacturers. The germans, swedes, and japanese are designing the factories and supplying talent in the form of production consultants and management consultants. \n \n The thought that the chinese markets will \"save\" the us auto industry over the next generation are nothing short the wishfull thinking of a desperate industry. If this is what you are banking on, you are in for some long, hungry years. \n \n \nRussia doesn't have enough available oil to quench China's growing appetite. \n \n \n Russia is only producing at 30% of currently avialable capacity because for all intents and purposes, their oil has already been sold to China. The deal included MORE than enough oil for chinas domestic needs for the next ten years even if chinas growth is much higher than projected. You have to keep in mind that China is not nearly as energy hungry as the US. They have invested heavily in renewable energy (especially hydroelectric). Electricity in china is FAR cheaper than in the US, and they have nearly 4x the generation capacity that they can currently use, and all their projects have been designed in such a manner that they can double their current output with minimal investment. Their current trend in automobiles (notwithsatnding the surge we have seen in luxury cars over the last year and a half) is rougly the same as other asian nations, where small, fuel efficient vehicles are heavily preferred in the market. In the last decade, the most sucessful consumer level vehicle sold has been a 34 HP lorry that gets nearly 70 miles to the gallon. \n \n This is the problem with dealing with a nation that has been around for a couple thousand years. They understand long term planning.\n \n On the other side of the coin, should the chinese start to produce automobiles for the US market, I can certainly see them drivng the US automakers out of business in short order, just like they have the majority of American shop tool manufacturers. Like most asian cultures, they value efficiency. since they have such an excellent power generation setup, their industrial energy costs are less than 1/4 what American manufaturers are paying. Unlike the japanese who have precious few domestic natural resources the chinese have massive quantities, and they are much cheaper to exploit than similar resources in the US. Also, just like with the toolmakers, the chinese are placing heavy tariffs on US goods, and we dont DARE put similar tariffs on chinese good since we NEED low cost chinese goods to feed the needs of our consumers as theri revenue declines.\n \n \n \nAs I've stated above, my area of expertise is in the auto industry. We don't have to make cars for China in the US and export them. We own a piece of China's auto market and it is growing daily. You'd be surprised at how much US money is funding Chinese industry. And do you think we're not doing it to make a profit? 80% of Chinese auto customers pay CASH for their cars right now. Imagine the cash flow from that alone.\n\n \n Almost 2%, and the Chinese governemnt says they will cap that at 5%. Nope, we are not going to do that hot. In addition, foreign owned factories in china are still subject to import trade tariffs. \n \n Current level of US funding for chinese industry overall is less than 1% realistically. The chinese have several hundred billion in cash reserves, and more expansion capitol than they know what to do with. They have so much left over capitol after expansion requirements are met that they are propping up the US dollar right now in order to maximise year end export profits, as wella s floating a fairly large percentage of our national debt to keep our consumer markets buying until they can get their average incomes high enough to support their own manufacturers through domestic consumption.\n \n foreign investment in chinese businesses requires government approval, and that is pretty difficult to get, and has proved doubly so for US comanies. Liek pretty much every other nation on the planet, the Chinese recognise a sinking ship when they see one and certainly do not want to see their comanies dragged down by foreign interests. \n \n \nWith a strong Canadian dollar, more Canadians are coming into the US to shop. Living near the border, I see an ever-increasing number of Canadian license plates in the mall parking lots. Unfortunately, since we buy more oil from Canada than any other country, the trade balance is lopsided.\n\n \n Incredibly lopsided, and we don't just buy more oil than canada than their tourists re spending here. we buy more EVERYTHING from canada than they buy from us. It is not even close.\n \n When you are counting on foreign tourists taking advantage of your worthless currency to keep you afloat, you are in deep trouble.\n \n \nI heard doom and gloom scenarios far worse just before the Republicans took over Congress in the 1994 election. Within two years, they were talking about how to spend the large surplus. Our national debt as a % of GDP is far less than the average US citizen's personal debt and, I don't know about you, but I'm far from going belly up. \n \n \n What would it really take to put you belly up? Loosing 30% of your income to inflation and a 40% drop in the value of your home, coupled to a subsequent 25-30 percent drop in the stock market would certainly do it for most folks, and that is a VERY realistic scenario. The first 2 are ALMOST CERTAIN to happen (OK, the first one is absolutly gauranteed, the second one may only be a 20% decline based on your location). The drop in the stock market following a 2 trillion dollar \"correction\" in teh real estate market is also assured.\n \n The \"gloom and doom\" predicted in 1994 is here. they were not talking immediate and drastic downfall of the US economy. \n \n This is the problem, for years people have been predicting gloom and doom for th eUS economy, and they have been right, and it is here. We haev been loosing over a trillion dollars a year and we are finally running out of money. Our national wealth is all but gone. Our \"knowledge\", which many argued would save us, has proven to be an undesirable commodity, and at this point there is not enough money left in the entire coutnry to bring our industrial infrastructure back up to needed levels. \n \n Nobody listend for years, now it is time to pay the piper.\n \n \nIf it wasn't for 9-11, we'd be in a very healthy economy and money would be flowing like water. As a result, our stock market tanked and we spent $Hundreds of Billion in military-related expenditures, but these are temporary abberations, not permanent trends IMO.\n\n \n Bull. 9/11 ended up spurring the economy. It is only through massive governemtn spending, including defense spending, that we managed to raise our GDP. While not really a good indicator of growth in an economy where it is falsely inflated by governemnt spending and debt driven consumer spending, a negative GDP in an economy driven by debt spending IS ALWAYS a bad thing. If you subtract 9/11 related spending form our GDP for the last 4 years, we have had \\negative growth every year. 9/11 gave the politicians a license to spend, which, on paper, pulled us out of the recessionw er were in. The upside to this is that we get to enjoy a few more years of carefree living. The downside is that instead of a grdaul recession ending in a ruined economy, we are now headed towards a cliff ending in aruined economy. it will be a much greater shock to the US public. I am not sure why. Even people who recognise that we have been runnign a negative trade balance for years, admit that our equity markets are badly overvalued, and accept the fact that our currency is rapidly turnign into fire starter material, somehow have trouble accepting that these things, while each abd on their own, can only have disasterous consequences together.\n \n \nAmericans, and particularly American businesses, are resourceful. We adapt to changing business climates. If the money's in the EU, we'll nvest there. If it's in China, we'll invest there. If it's on the Moon, we'll invest there. As long as the US has real wealth, which it does, we will survive despite the doom and gloomers.\n\n \n Americas \"real wealth\" has run out of the country a trillion a year for the last several decades, and that is just trade imbalance and securing trade. This doesn't even account for the tirllions spent on little military projects around the globe. \n \n China and the EU have both taken pains to ensure Americans keep their money to themselves. They don't wnat to be dragged down wiht us.\n \n I am glad to see your completely unsupportable, blind enthusiasm is still intact.",

   "In regards to the automotive industry in China. Almost every foreign manufacturer who sets up house in China is required to do so with a domestic Chinese Partner. For GM and Volkswagen that is Shanghia Automotive ( not the full name) and Shanghia generally owns the majority share. What this is allowing China to do is develop its auto industry and experience quickly and relatively cheaply. Dont think that for one minitute that Shanghia is not planning on becoming a full and independant auto manufacturer. If I recall correctly they have recently bought the remenants of a near bankrupt South Korean manufacturer. Also the profits in China for the auto industry are declining fast as supply increases, and of course the lack of intelectual property rights also is a problem ( see Cherie autos in China and a near direct copy of a small GM car ( based on a Daewoo design I believe.\n \n Overall the US auto industry (big two and a half ) is headed for extremely hard times. China is not going to be a saviour, more like the final nail. GM and Ford, untill they start producing cars that people generally really want because they are good cars, not because they are either very cheap (discounts) or for patriotic reasons (buy American) the decline is going to go further and harder as they can no longer afford the generous benifit packages that their unions have negotiated.\n \n \n \n Overall the US government and most of its companies have been very shortsighted in regards to economic policies and the results are finally going to hit home in the next few years",

   "The US has invested heavily in China, especially in the auto industry. That is one area in which Japan is trailing Europe and the US badly. Of over 4Million cars made in China, only ~500k have been partially Japanese-based vehicles. The predominant number have been German and US joint ventures and the numbers are growing rapidly. China's car production will exceed the US' in 20 years and it's mainly US and EU companies that will benefit from the huge growth.\n :)\n\n \n Toyota is now in the middle of constructing what will be China's largest vehicle production facility, one of four planned over the next few years. No outsider will ever know the actual operating and ownership terms, but if it follows other such agreements, China has legal controlling interest, profits are evenly split, the foreign entity supplies all capital and all assets revert to Chinese ownership when the agreement expires, most around 2021, when China's currently publicized 10-year plan for that period culminates. With foreign companies supplying virtually all capital for business, China is putting their profits into domestic infrastructure improvements at such a high level that they've created world shortages of steel, cement and other construction basics. And buying much of it with US trade dollars to shed some of that burden. When completed, their industrial efficiency will make much of the world appear as modern as a Model T Ford. These are not juicy deals for US and Euro companies, they're a means of survival and the ability to possibly retain their corporate identity in what shows every indication of easily displacing the US as the world's largest economy in not all that many years. \n \n Conservative? Most conservatives now seem to be in China, where debt is shunned, government participation in commerce is to enhance expansion and advanced education is still directed to outstanding students who will make contributions without concern of stressing equality to develop mediocrity. Sound like the US of not that many years ago? Of course it does.",

We have just lost our political party to foks who don't even know what a conservative is. \n \n I think the party that most closely represents real conservatives is most likely the libertarian party (that's right, George, as a true conservative you have been relegated to the lunatic fringe).\n \n \n The appeal of a nanny state has just been too much for many to resist. Think of the benifits! A nation where you don't have to think, where no matter how stupid you are, your government can be counted on to watch your back. And all they ask is for your freedom and liberty. \n \n I think a quote from Alexander Tyler is in order here:\n \n \"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves money from the public coffers. From that moment on, the majority always votes for political candidates promising the most money from the public treasury, with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, followed shortly by a dictatorship.\"\n \n \n I must admit that for a lot of years, I thought he was wrong. Now I am fairly certain he was dead on. This latest round of elections, if nothing else, showed that a trillion dollar social program aimed at a large voting block, followed by promises of 3 trillion in additional social spending in the next term is a winning combination. And as Americas national wealth disapears, you can certainly see governemtn controlls tightening (they have been for years) as the governemtn moves to ensure that they are in a position to keep a disillusioned public under their thumb.\n \n Of course, this brings to mind another quote, this one by thomas Jefferson:\n \n \"God forbid we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion [Shays's Rebellion]. The people cannot be all, and always, well-informed. The part which is wrong will be discontented in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive. If they remain quiet under such misconceptions, it is a lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty. We have had thirteen States independent for eleven years. There has been one rebellion. That comes to one rebellion in a century and a half for each State. What country ever before existed a century and a half without a rebellion. And what country can preserve its liberties if its rulers are not warned from time to time that the people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms! The remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure. \"\n \n I find myself becoming more militant as the years pass and our nation falters. A nation once founded on (what we would today call) libertarian ideals has decayed to the point that it is little more than an nanny state. A nation where the senator from georgia was once hung from a lampost in the streets of atlanta for lying to his constituency has degraded to the point that our politicians lie to us so often we are used to it. We hardly take notice. \n \n Unfortunatly, I think that traditional conservative thinking has gone from the realm of percieved common sense to that of idealistic mumbojumbo with no place in the real world. Sdaly, I think there are engouh Americans out there that feel this way that it is likely to late to change it by working the system. Too many people WANT to be absloved of personal responsibility in all matters. To many people all to willingly line up and swallow the \"for the public good\" line when the special interest whores that we send to washington to represent us run roughshod over our personal liberties.\n \n To many people have forgotten that \"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people\". And even in forgetting the 9th amendment, our politicians cant keep their damn hands off of the rights which ARE specifically enumerated in the bill of rights. They are too powerful. With nothing but those rights, a governemtn can be brought to ruin. Our governement \"of the people\" was replaced years ago by a government of power hungry special interest whores who care just engouh about the people to be re-elected so they can sell their congressional votes to the highest bidder.",

What most Americans fail to realize is that the surface actions, legalities, conversation, publicity, etc. have nothing to do with the actual deal. That is a totally different world. Honda successfully suing China for patent infringement could mean a number of things, the most likely being public acknowledgment of Honda as a winner while China was picking up an extra 5-10% on the licensing agreement. China is calling the shots and Japan is perfectly happy to get what they can, as are most manufacturers after a piece of that pie that's so big it'll eventually make the US economy at its peak look like a banana republic.\n \n As an example, a friend and business associate was using the finance arm of one of the companies that dominate Japan's industrial empire to provide the equity (leverage) portions of aircraft leases to major airlines. He had the production of two short-range aircraft companies supposedly financed for a three-year period. Shortly before the end of the first year, the Japanese equity player came to him and stated they would end their participation at the close of that US calender year. Why? Because their turn was up. My friend was instructed to approach another of the Japanese giants for the next year's equity because it was the 'new' company's turn at the money trough to take the aircraft depreciation and offset taxable profits of their US subs. \n \n Unusual? No. Very common. Our public (US) definitions of democracy (Japan) and communism with developing capitalism (China) differ as wildly from reality as our comprehension of business agreements. Just as we obviously know nothing about ME and Asian resolve, consisting of historical patience in the pursuit of goals foreign to our immediate gratification society, we're so wrapped up in ourselves we often make assumptions on business developments that are worthless.\n \n For a really graphic example, Take a look at how easy it is for our professional politicians deceive the public on a continual basis.",

I explained to him he was correct about the first part of his assumption but that I didn't care one bit about the rights of the little man beyond keeping him from damaging or taking my property and providing defense cannon fodder and considered equality basically a guilt trip being utilized by so-called political representatives to suppress the cream of the crop of all nationalities and ethnic groups in an effort to produce controllable mediocrity. \n \n He couldn't defend Iraq beyond the asinine 'possible' WMDs, forcing democracy in the ME, attempted to tie Bin Laden with Iraq, justify the 'No idiot left behind' bill and didn't have a glimmer of knowledge about the US economy other than reciting some government growth and employment statistics, all of which I quickly fed back to him with some reality.

Honda successfully suing China for patent infringement could mean a number of things, the most likely being public acknowledgment of Honda as a winner while China was picking up an extra 5-10% on the licensing agreement. China is calling the shots and Japan is perfectly happy to get what they can, as are most manufacturers after a piece of that pie that's so big it'll eventually make the US economy at its peak look like a banana republic.\n\n Currently, even if Honda does win, it's a token fine and then busines as usual.\n Lately, China's government has given lip service about strengthening its intellectual property rights statutes, but I don't see it cracking down wide-scale and killing the goose that lays the golden eggs for it. Piracy is big business in China and the ChiComs are certainly getting their piece of the action.\n Recently, I found myself \"volunteered\" for the unenviable task of being the US conduit for technology transferred to a new Chinese partner. It's like being given the responsibility to saw off your own leg to avoid starvation. You know that no good can come of it, but the alternative sucks as well.\n \n\n As an example, a friend and business associate was using the finance arm of one of the companies that dominate Japan's industrial empire to provide the equity (leverage) portions of aircraft leases to major airlines. He had the production of two short-range aircraft companies supposedly financed for a three-year period. Shortly before the end of the first year, the Japanese equity player came to him and stated they would end their participation at the close of that US calender year. Why? Because their turn was up. My friend was instructed to approach another of the Japanese giants for the next year's equity because it was the 'new' company's turn at the money trough to take the aircraft depreciation and offset taxable profits of their US subs. \n\n One of the biggest stumbling block to more US companies competing in Asia is our corporate business ethics. We have them and EU and Asian companies that we compete against don't. It's as simple as that. The EU and Asia work via kickbacks and bribes and US-based companies refuse to play the game, in general. \n \n\n Unusual? No. Very common. Our public (US) definitions of democracy (Japan) and communism with developing capitalism (China) differ as wildly from reality as our comprehension of business agreements. Just as we obviously know nothing about ME and Asian resolve, consisting of historical patience in the pursuit of goals foreign to our immediate gratification society, we're so wrapped up in ourselves we often make assumptions on business developments that are worthless.\n\n When a US business goes to China to negotiate, the Chinese company checks the US company's reservations at the hotel and find out when the delegation is scheduled to leave. They, then, stall negotiations until just before its time for the US delegation to leave. By doing this, they have placed additional stress on the US delegates to act quickly and not get the most favorable terms. A smart US negotiating team uys one-way tickets to China, keeps an open-ended hotel reservation and doesn't allow the Chinese company to employ such tactics. (That story came directly from a Big Three Auto negotiator) \n \n\n For a really graphic example, Take a look at how easy it is for our professional politicians deceive the public on a continual basis.\n\n \n Are you surprised that a politician that promises to be all things to all people gets elected? Even if people know they are compulsive liars? I'm not.",

It's as simple as that. The EU and Asia work via kickbacks and bribes and US-based companies refuse to play the game, in general. \n \n\n \n US public companies open themselves to stockholder litigation if they stray too far from their articles of incorporation. It worked fine when we dominated virtually all world mass markets with no competition. Now we're scrambling for business in markets where the primary manufacturer has a tight hold and has established how business will be conducted. Those individuals with marketing responsibilities including product for public US companies have to be under stress leading to serious addictions or failed health. Their hands are tied to the point of China not requiring a pistol to get what it wants. When the bribes aren't paid up front, normally political considerations at the upper level but cash is always king, the weakened negotiator has to relinquish margin to do business. Pay now or pay later.\n \n China likes our involvement in the War on Terror and Iraq situation because it provides distraction. China isn't at war with anyone. Nor is Japan. They have the world's largest economy at their beck and call. I have no solutions to offer, we simply don't have the means or direction to compete with China. I think we've joined that group that watched the US go through our period of great prosperity and rode in back. Some prospered by positioning themselves to take advantage of our windfall, like Japan, some didn't. How gracefully we go through this change is, to me, the only question.",
