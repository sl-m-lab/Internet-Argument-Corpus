Now they want to be our friends again... they're sorry. Too bad. I don't think we should let these guys have contracts in Iraq... I don't think the Iraqis will either. Germany supplied a lot of arms and WMD equipment to Iraq, and France, Russia, and China have big oil deals and are big trading partners. They've been funding Saddam. \n \n Too late to be sorry... you just want to make more money in Iraq and American boycotts to end. I hope it doesn't happen.",

We will make the world safe from terrorism, one way or the other. We do not need to wait until more innocent Americans die before we act. That is like trying to get out of your car after the train has already hit it, it is too late once we have another 9/11.
