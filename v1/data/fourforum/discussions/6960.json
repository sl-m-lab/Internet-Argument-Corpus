   "That recent article on selling Alaska back to Russia of well-known columnist Steven Pearlstein, it made me tense. If it was meant as kind of satire, the humor was fully lost on me. If he was earnest, then it's worth debating. Perhaps they are right, those people talking of the article as targeted on swindler republican MP T. Stevens. Imo it was mainly trial balloon to explore public inclinations and visions. These are hard times for America. It's on the verge of scaring crisis. Add there huge sums spent on Iraqi war and elsewhere in the world. Coupled with the enormous foreign debt of America it amounts to economical dead-end. What I'm driving at is that administration could be exploring every chance even some 'unrealistic ideas' to survive. If so 'Alaska Would Be More at Home in Russia'. But this perspective is boring imo.",

   "I think rather, a good start would be to discontinue the payments the US government makes to those who live there, just for living there. In 2003, 600,000 residents received a payment of $1,107!! That's a lot of people, and a lot of money. I wish I got paid for living where I do!\n \n http://www.uaf.edu/journal/extreme/pfd/",

The state government does.\n \n Alaska has HUGE mineral and oil reserves. The state is paid royalties for allowing them to be mined/pumped/etc...\n \n In the real world, there is little or (mroe probably) no hope of developing industry in Alaska. The winters are simply too harsh and shipping costs for finished goods are prohibitive.\n \n So, the state has a huge income, and nothing to spend it on. So, they kick it back to the people. \n \n What would you suggest they do with that money? Theya red essentially int he same boat as most of the Middle East. They have no real industry or realistic expectations of growing one. What they DO have is massive natural resources. In the ME they did things a little different. 90% of the oil revenues go to 2% of the people, and everybody else ends up dirt poor.",
