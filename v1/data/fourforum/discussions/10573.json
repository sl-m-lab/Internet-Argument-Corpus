   "What moral attitude should we take toward Globalism?\n \n From the American workers view the positive side of Globalism is that many workers worldwide in very poor countries will experience a significant increase in their standard of living because the manufacturing of certain products that were manufactured in America are manufactured in their country.\n \n From the American workers view the negative side of Globalism is that the standard of living of many Americans will decline significantly because of the work that has gone to poor countries. \n \n From the American capital owning and financial brokerage view Globalism is the best thing since sliced bread.\n \n What moral judgment should all Americans take toward Globalism? I have no answers to this very difficult question. This is the type of question that leads some people, like me, to duck their moral principles. \n \n I suspect that Americans with capital will reap great advantage from Globalism but working Americans will be net losers. The workers and the capital owning citizens in poor countries will be large net winners.",

   "What is globalism & globalization?\n \n \n \n Joe Nye, former Dean of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, informs us: Globalism describes the existence of various forms of networks that interconnect multi-continental distances while globalization describes the degree of globalism. In short, Nye considers \"Globalism as the underlying basic network, while globalization refers to the dynamic shrinking of distance on a large scale\"... globalization is the process by which globalism becomes increasingly thick and/or intense. \n \n There are four distinct dimensions of globalism: economic, which is the flow of goods and services; environmental, which is the effect upon the worlds environment and health; social, which is the flow of ideas and the effect of those ideas and ideologies upon the worlds cultures; and of course, there is the military dimension where power is displayed world wise by all cultures with such power.",

   "The Global society has been beneficial to humanity as a whole. It isn't a new concept and is the factor that brought the US its wealth in the first place.\n It can be traced back at least to the time of the East India Company in the 1600s and took Britain to the dominant position of global power from 1814 to 1939. At this point history favoured the US model which has held the dominant position since then though it has abandoned its original strengths and others are now looking to exploit the opportunities it leaves.\n It may be that the US fails to understand the nature of their own position which leaves them vulnerable to foreign moves as Britain was in the 1920s.\n The Global market is open to exploitation which includes everything from Asian sweat shops to the Slave trade into the Southern US.\n That doesn't make it evil, it also opens people to other cultures and ideas which would otherwise be cofined to far off places, eg. Curry, Chop Suey, Manga, Bollywood, Westerns (Foreign to a European audience), etc. \n In all it is neither good or bad, that is only the viewpoint of individuals.",

I also believe many people are over paid in this country (US) for the work they do and that financial education is 100% lacking for most resulting in frivelous waste on consumables and indebtedness.\n I think mega corporations only are concerned with the bottom line of profit for share holders and unless pressured by consumers, would do nothing in regards to long term planning for the world as a whole (beyond planning to increase profits in the future).",

   "Morality must be safeguarded by the citizens\n \n I was listening to the radio the other day and the speaker said something to the effect 'let the market decide the value of our higher education system...and the market appears to think that our higher education system is doing a good job'.\n \n Is it wise to allow the market to set the standard of value for our colleges and universities?\n \n Philosopher, tycoon, philanthropist, author, and international political activist George Soros said in his book \"Open Society\" that as an anonymous market participant I never had to weigh the social consequences of my action. \"Still my decisions had social consequences...When I sold sterling short in 1992, the Bank of England was on the other side of my transactions, and I was in effect taking money out of the pockets of British taxpayers...Britain would have devalued sterling whether I had been born or not.\"\n \n Soros makes clear that he recognizes that the argument 'If I didn't do it someone else would' holds true only for financial markets. Anonymous market participants are immune from moral considerations as long as they play by the rules. In this sense financial markets are not immoral; they are amoral.\n \n There is a difference between immorality and amorality. Amorality makes markets more efficient and without this difference such markets could not flourish. Soros argues that such an argument applies to the person who considers her or him self as being a moral person or not.\n \n Collective values must be safe guarded by collective political and civic actions and institutions. The amorality of the markets makes it essential that social values find expression in the rules that govern financial markets.\n \n Rules are made by the authorities and the authorities are chosen by the citizens. Morality must be safeguarded by the citizens. If the citizen fails to meet some minimum level of civic responsibility, is that citizen acting in an amoral manner or in an immoral manner?",

   "I believe it immoral to make profits overseas by exploiting the lack of labor and environmental protections in many developing countries.\n\n \n Is it more immoral to let millions suffer in extreme poverty? In 50 years South Koreans have moved from the absolute 3rd world to the first by engaging in globalization and trade. Yes they suffered environmental degradation along with other problems, but look where they are now. You will not find a single industrialized nation that did not damage its environment or exploit its cheap labor to get where it is now. In fact, historically that is how they got rich. \n \n \nIf we mean to walk the walk then we must not import products that are produced in environments that would be illegal if they were in this country.\n\n \n The problem is that they wouldn't be produced there and the deflationary effect of globalization wouldn't exist, thus our quality of life would decrease in the West and opportunities and development in the 3rd and periphery would slow. Allegedly globalization has added 10% to the US economy. South Korea is essentially built entirely on globalization.\n \n The model works. It's not perfect, but it is better then merchantism.",
