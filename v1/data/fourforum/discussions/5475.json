   "I've looked this list over. I would agree with most of it. I would have added another book but that was from the 7th century. That would probably have topped my list.\n ======================\n Ten Most Harmful Books of the 19th and 20th Centuries\n \n Posted May 31, 2005\n \n HUMAN EVENTS asked a panel of 15 conservative scholars and public policy leaders to help us compile a list of the Ten Most Harmful Books of the 19th and 20th Centuries. Each panelist nominated a number of titles and then voted on a ballot including all books nominated. A title received a score of 10 points for being listed No. 1 by one of our panelists, 9 points for being listed No. 2, etc. Appropriately, The Communist Manifesto, by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, earned the highest aggregate score and the No. 1 listing.\n \n 1. The Communist Manifesto\n \n Authors: Karl Marx and Freidrich Engels\n Publication date: 1848\n Score: 74\n Summary: Marx and Engels, born in Germany in 1818 and 1820, respectively, were the intellectual godfathers of communism. Engels was the original limousine leftist: A wealthy textile heir, he financed Marx for much of his life. In 1848, the two co-authored The Communist Manifesto as a platform for a group they belonged to called the Communist League. The Manifesto envisions history as a class struggle between oppressed workers and oppressive owners, calling for a workers' revolution so property, family and nation-states can be abolished and a proletarian Utopia established. The Evil Empire of the Soviet Union put the Manifesto into practice.\n \n 2. Mein Kampf\n \n Author: Adolf Hitler\n Publication date: 1925-26\n Score: 41\n Summary: Mein Kampf (My Struggle) was initially published in two parts in 1925 and 1926 after Hitler was imprisoned for leading Nazi Brown Shirts in the so-called \"Beer Hall Putsch\" that tried to overthrow the Bavarian government. Here Hitler explained his racist, anti-Semitic vision for Germany, laying out a Nazi program pointing directly to World War II and the Holocaust. He envisioned the mass murder of Jews, and a war against France to precede a war against Russia to carve out \"lebensraum\" (\"living room\") for Germans in Eastern Europe. The book was originally ignored. But not after Hitler rose to power. According to the Simon Wiesenthal Center, there were 10 million copies in circulation by 1945...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=7591",

I didn't wish to leave that impression. I have not taken the time to read his works. Actually I admire him in many ways. Some years ago there was a television series on his journeys to South America and his subsequent theories. I essentially agree with the central thrust of what he is saying. However, it is impossible to conclude at this point of our knowledge base that evolution can explain the original source of the universe and life as we know it.

   "I think that this list is bizarre at best. Some of them seem to be based on bad results: Des Kapital etc. Then Mein Kampf is included, which had no influence whatsoever, and then feminists and progressive economists and politicians. In the honourable mentions is J S Mill's 'on Liberty'. What's wrong with that?",

   "I see nothing wrong with most of these books.\n \n What kills me is their corresponding blurbs:\n \n About Das Kapital:\n He could not have predicted 21st Century America: a free, affluent society based on capitalism and representative government that people the world over envy and seek to emulate.\n The only reason we've lasted this long is because of socialist measures to check capitalism. You know, things like the 40-hour work week, 8 hour work day, the minimum wage. Actually, who works 40 hours a week anymore? But anyway, there are socialist modifications to US capitalism, and that's pretty much the only reason we don't have an economy like we did in the late 19th century.\n \n About Democracy and Education:\n His views had great influence on the direction of American education--particularly in public schools--and helped nurture the Clinton generation.\n What the hell is the \"Clinton generation\"?\n As if Clinton spawned an entire generation of American youth himself (not ruling this out...)\n \n About The Feminine Mystique:\n In The Feminine Mystique, Betty Friedan, born in 1921, disparaged traditional stay-at-home motherhood as life in \"a comfortable concentration camp\"--a role that degraded women and denied them true fulfillment in life. She later became founding president of the National Organization for Women. Her original vocation, tellingly, was not stay-at-home motherhood but left-wing journalism. As David Horowitz wrote in a review for Salon.com of Betty Friedan and the Making of the Feminine Mystique by Daniel Horowitz (no relation to David): The author documents that \"Friedan was from her college days, and until her mid-30s, a Stalinist Marxist, the political intimate of the leaders of America's Cold War fifth column and for a time even the lover of a young Communist physicist working on atomic bomb projects in Berkeley's radiation lab with J. Robert Oppenheimer.\"\n \n They try to tie women who didn't become housewives to Stalinism somehow?\n \n About The Course of Positive Philosophy:\n He did so while theorizing that the human mind had developed beyond \"theology\" (a belief that there is a God who governs the universe), through \"metaphysics\" (in this case defined as the French revolutionaries' reliance on abstract assertions of \"rights\" without a God), to \"positivism,\" in which man alone, through scientific observation, could determine the way things ought to be.\n Yeah! I'll bet he's burning in HELL!!! Buhahaha! emoticon_angry \n \n About Beyond Good and Evil:\n The Nazis loved Nietzsche.\n Yeah, they also loved Werner Heisenberg, as he was their chief nuclear physicist working for them on an atomic bomb.\n That means we should scrap all his theories.\n \n About General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money:\n FDR adopted the idea as U.S. policy, and the U.S. government now has a $2.6-trillion annual budget and an $8-trillion dollar debt.\n WAIT A MINUTE!! I THOUGHT:\n 21st Century America [was a] a free, affluent society based on capitalism and representative government that people the world over envy and seek to emulate.\n emoticon_wow",
