Sadly, there are many who think like you out there, and while they really like Nader's stance on the issues better, they will vote for Kerry or Bush simply because they don't think Nader can win. And what terrible things has Bush done in office? Personally, I have never voted for the simple fact that there has not been a candidate yet since I have been 18y/o that I would be able to say I am proud that I helped elect to the white house. If one comes along, I will vote. If I elect some crook who screws up the country, would I not partially be to blame? I think Bush is doing an OK job with the hand that was dealt to him. I certainly don't think from what I have seen of him that Kerry could have done any better, nor even come close to handeling things as well as Bush. Bush can at least make up his mind on the issues, Kerry trys to play both sides of the record at the same time.

Voting other than your conscience is wasting your vote. If everyone said \"well geez, if my guy doesn't win I am just wasting my vote, I guess I better vote for the guy that is ahead in the polls\", one candidate would get 100% of the vote. Sadly, there are many who think like you out there, and while they really like Nader's stance on the issues better, they will vote for Kerry or Bush simply because they don't think Nader can win. And what terrible things has Bush done in office? Personally, I have never voted for the simple fact that there has not been a candidate yet since I have been 18y/o that I would be able to say I am proud that I helped elect to the white house. If one comes along, I will vote. If I elect some crook who screws up the country, would I not partially be to blame? I think Bush is doing an OK job with the hand that was dealt to him. I certainly don't think from what I have seen of him that Kerry could have done any better, nor even come close to handeling things as well as Bush. Bush can at least make up his mind on the issues, Kerry trys to play both sides of the record at the same time. Personally, I think Edwards would have done a better job than both of them, I guess we will have to wait another 4 years or so to find out.\n\n \n Um, sorry I haven't been here to stick up for myself in a while. Vacation. Now, okay, I still stand strong with the fact that voting for Nader would be the wrong choice. And no I don't think that the person should vote for whomever is at the top of the poll, just not the 8% person who really has no chance of winning. And I'm sorry that I was 'telling' people who to vote for, I guess it should have been more like a suggestion.\n \n And I am sorry that I did not include a source of all the terrible things I believe Bush has done so...eh...I don't quite know how to add a source so bear with me here..\n http://politicalhumor.about.com/library/blbushresume.htm\n \n Well, yeah, that's all.

   "MESSAGE TO AMERICA'S STUDENTS FROM RALPH NADER\n Nader: The War, The Draft, Your Future\n \n \n We have been down this road before.\n \n U.S. troops sent to war half a world away. American foreign policy controlled by an arrogant elite, bent on projecting military power around the globe. A public misled into supporting an unconstitutional war founded on deceit and fabrications. \n \n As the death toll mounts, we hear claims that the war is nearly won, that victory is just around the corner. But victory never arrives.\n \n As the public loses confidence in the government, the government questions the patriotism of any who express doubt about the war. \n \n When a presidential election arrives, both the Democrat and Republican nominees embrace the policy of continued war. \n \n The military draft comes to dominate the lives of America's young, and vast numbers who believe the war to be a senseless blunder are faced with fighting a war they do not believe in, or facing exile or prison. \n \n The year was 1968. Because voters had no choice that November, the Vietnam War continued for another six years. Hundreds of thousands of Americans like you died, were maimed, or suffered from diseases like malaria. A far greater number of Vietnamese died.\n \n Today, the war is in the quicksands and alleys of Iraq. Once again, under the pressure of a determined resistance, we see an American war policy being slowly torn apart at the seams, while the candidates urge us to \"stay the course\" in this tragic misadventure. Today's Presidential candidates are not Nixon and Humphrey, they are now Bush and Kerry. \n \n Once again, there is one overriding truth: If war is the only choice in this election, then war we will have. \n \n Today enlistments in the Reserves and National Guard are declining. The Pentagon is quietly recruiting new members to fill local draft boards, as the machinery for drafting a new generation of young Americans is being quietly put into place.\n \n Young Americans need to know that a train is coming, and it could run over their generation in the same way that the Vietnam War devastated the lives of those who came of age in the sixties.\n \n I am running for President, and have been against this war from the beginning. We must not waste lives in order to control and waste more oil. Stand with us and we may yet salvage your future and Americas' future from this looming disaster.\n \n - Ralph Nader",
