Its a very strict and uncaring culture, and this isn't true just in school, its true also in the work place. Do we want our kids to grow up to have that to look forward to? Why would we take away one of the advantages this nation has, in order to try and compete on someone else's level?\n \n I'd like to end by saying that I don't think uniforms are a good idea, and I don't think they're a solution, just another half-measure that tries to make the government take over certain jobs and responsibilities of parents.",

   "Thirty one years in the same district, now reitred.

Yeah, I think they are very worthwile.\n \n [FWIW, I went to a private elementary; we had to wear skirts and tops with collars and sleeves, both solid; bottoms navy or black; guys had to wear at least dress chinos in navy or black and shirts with collars and cuffs. My biggest problem? Being \"creative within the confines of the no-uniform-uniform\". It was fun...and I don't find myself supressed by the experience.... in fact, I still tend to buy navy or black classic clothes and they last forever -I dress it up with jewelry, its a new outift....you can't say that in another year about lime and turquoise or pink and orange paisley georgette!]\n \n Uniforms - Yes, with latitude of some choices (like I had)",

   "Mum and dad were saying again how they don't like school girls wearing tiny skirts to school. This is what I think on the issue:\n \n Girls were one of the highlights of being at school and if they made girls wear longer skirts boys would miss out on the fun of seeing girls in short skirts. That was one of the highlights. Plus school is boring enough without taking away one of the highlights.\n \n I don't believe in the word whore. That word is a piece of ####. If women who are prostitutes (who have sex safely) or escorts want to have sex in a job and look sexy then that is their choice. The word whore is an insult. You can't call schoolgirls whores because that is bad.\n \n Arguing that school girls uniforms should be made longer is also stupid when young girls and teenage girls go to nudist camps. No-one complains about that.\n \n The way I see it. People who are saying schoolgirls skirts should be made longer are gay and old fashioned. Girls in short skirts at school is one of the highlights and gives schoolboys an experience in the world of sex and sexy. It is a time when boys at high school start masterbating. That is another reason why schoolgirls should always wear very small skirts to school.\n \n Thankyou.\n \n If you want to contact me email me at abgop@aol.com or join me online on messenger with these addy's:\n \n MSN: ezrafire@hotmail.com\n YAHOO: smoogiemassive@yahoo.co.uk\n AOL OR AIM: abgop@aol.com\n \n Aron",

It is mandatory, therefore that is a completely moot point, and not all parents can afford homeschooling.\n \n \n And let me say that I have attended a uniform school. Uniforms have the opposite effect that they're supposed to. They take focus off education, and turn administrators into clothes Nazis. No uniforms will not draw any attention to student's clothes. At my high school no one cares what other people are wearing unless its ridiculous. Why should good students who get good grades and always obey the dress code be made to wear a uniform? Why should they suffer for other people's actions. If uniforms are going to be used at all, they should be used for the kids who violate the dress code. The decision should ultimately be up to students and faculty, because they know what its like now, and they know what works best for their school. It shouldn't be decided by overzealous parents or beurocrats.\n \n \n If you want students to rebel, then put them in uniforms, because thats all that uniforms are good for.",

As long as they have a little control they will be happy. As long as the school system is getting the message that students do have some control over their lives, it will not encourage rebellion. If the school sets reasonable regulations, however lets the students have some control (IE leaving campus for lunch, or any other time not in class, not having a minimum number of classes that must be taken, just a credit requirement) will let them know that they do have a say in what goes on in their lives.

What if the government argued that they were not infringing freedom of speech, but merely infringing the \"freedom not to say anything bad about the president\"?\n \n And also, freedom of speech means you can't yell fire in a crowded movie theater, just as you can't come to school naked and painted blue.\n \n \n \n \n \nContradictory much?\n I guess the answer to your first would be 'well, that's too bad, isn't it'.\n\n \n Right, because leaving everyone they know and care about behind will really help them in biology emoticon_rolleyes.\n \n \n \nThe answer to the second would be that school uniforms also serve a purpose.\n\n \n School uniforms serve no purpose, therefore this is moot.\n \n \n \n \nClose enough?\n\n \n No.\n \n \n \nWhy not?\n\n \n The same reason freedom of speech isn't a reward.\n \n \n \nNote that this isn't a change from 'no expression' to 'some expression', it is just a small increase in your freedom - you are already hugely free to do as you please, regardless of how you may feel. Ask your parents (or, more likely, their parents) about corporeal punishment in schools.\n\n \n Should I also ask them about slavery? Should we have also told blacks that they should be grateful that we were only segregating them and not enslaving them? That even though segregated, they could still do as they please?",

   "Personally, I think school uniforms are a great idea. Even though some people may say that argument about kids getting teased for not being 'fashionable' is untrue, I know for a fact that the kids in the schools I went to did. I grew up in some pretty run lower end communities and you got laughed at if you came to school in dirty sneakers or if your fitted cap wasn't fresh. Mocked if your clothes weren't up to their standards even if it's because your parents just can't afford to dress you in $100 sneakers or $80 jeans.\n \n It's really just from my personal experience that I agree with school uniforms being made mandatory. I've heard some pretty messed up things being said about genuinely nice people just because they were poor and everyone knew it because of their shoes or messy clothes. Maybe the uniforms wouldn't change that completely, but it'd still give the bullies one less thing to harp about.\n \n My only issue with uniforms is their usual plain and ugly look. I have no clue why these companies insist on making them so boring and unflattering so often. From what I've seen and worn, they generally pick the worst color combination you could think of--especially with plaids. I dreaded the dark blue and putrid green plaid skirt I had to wear in my freshman year of high school and tended to stick to wearing the boring grey pants.

   "I think it really depends on the dynamics of the school. Each school is different due to socio-economic status, multicultural diversity, location, etc. I teach at a school where in the last 5 years or so we went from a 95% caucasian school to about a 50% caucasian school and we have been trying to help build bridges across multiple cultures. It's a hard job. \n \n We have seen a huge increase in gang activity and there are a lot of cross culture issues. The weird part is that the gang culture here is mixed together, so we don't have segregation among the gang culture, but we don't want the gang culture in the first place. If uniforms will help decrease gang affiliation then I'm all for it because I'm tired of all the fights that occur due to gang activity. \n \n I think we need to focus on the most important thing, which is feeling safe in school. There are other ways of expressing individuality besides how you dress. Yeah it does take away some individuality, but which is more important, safety or individuality? Look at the numbers in decreasing amounts of violence that have occurred from implementing school uniforms. If clothes define exactly who you are, then this is a pitiful world. \n \n In addition to that a lot of people will go on about how if we have parents just step on in and discipline their kids then we won't have to worry about it, well then more power to you, but if parents aren't doing anything now, when will they start? Also I have worked with parents who do discipline their children and have tried everything and are pulling their hair out in frustration because they don't know what to do with their child, even good parents have children that make bad choices. Also I have parents who try their best, but due to their socio-economic status they are working two to three jobs and it is really hard for them to be there for their children. So to sum it all up I think it is worth a shot to see if uniforms really do help to cut down on disciplinary problems. When disciplinary problems are cut down it helps to enhance learning. I have personally improved in my discipline since I began teaching, I try to treat all my students the same, but I let my students express themselves individually. There are other ways of self-expression besides clothes.",

   "There were a lot of things I saw that I disagreed with and a few I did agreed with but I thought the easiest way to reply to it all would be to just post my opinion and let everyone else respond.\n \n I do not think that under any normal circumstance should uniforms be made mandatory in public schooling required by the government. If you want to institute a uniform, go ahead, but make it mandatory and I will give you a war. The public school system (which is funded by the government and must abide by the governments requirements of freedoms and such) should never be given the power to require that something as basic as the clothing you wear match within a very small poll of options. Children weren't given the option to come to school, the government said they had to. And for you people out there that will scream about school vouchers, private schools and homeschooling, lets be realistic. Most parents (knowing that almost all dads AND moms now have to work full time jobs to pay for the cost of living) simple don't have the time/energy after everything else to put their children somewhere else or the money. \n \n Now, this is from my own personal experience, but I go to what is commonly referred to as a \"rich kid\" school district. However, we actually have a good part of our district that serves middle class neighborhoods and even some on the poor side. I have never been bullied over my clothing, and I am not one of the rich kids (I can promise you that ;)). Now, if you came in and all your clothing my super-dirty you would get a few looks and people may avoid you, but they aren't going to come right out and bully you. Most of the bullying that actually happens in my school is between the super rich kids over boyfriends and such. Clothing rarely comes in as a factor anymore in rich vs. poor bullying. \n \n Now I know that there may be schools out there that truely are having problems educating their students because of disruptions, some of which may be associated with clothing. If thats the case, trying out a unifrom policy is understandable in my opinion, but you better have an opt-out policy that is as simple as the parent filling out a form.\n \n Thats my take, anybody have anything to say on it?",

And instead of attempting to eliminate ways a child may be picked on, why not eliminate those who are doing the picking? Again, teach individual responsiblity to people, even the bullies.

Rules are meaningless unless applied in a fair and consistent manner. You would think that adults in charge of children should be able to be fair and consistent. Don't punish the children for the immaturity of the adult. \n \n \nThat being said, uniforms can contribute to a more balanced society.\n\n How?

   "For me I think it depends on the school. In middle school I was for them to fit in with everyone else. There was this one girl in particular who would torture me. Then I would wear sweat shirts to school and stay after because I was afraid of talking in class because I spoke very quickly and was teased for that. Now that I stop to think about it it was probably jealousy. At that point, my parents and extended family were involved in my school life. That year I was getting my own room (I shared with my little brother before), and I was out of class a lot and was a staff favorite and I had bad asthma and this year I was at the nurses a lot for the whole asthma thing. My grade had experienced an asthma attack which had the teachers checking on me every class and making sure I had my inhaler and had my nurse mother on speed dial. They even moved my desk so I was by the windows for fresh air. This girl would even tell me not to go to the pencil sharpener until I got some designer clothes and then come see her. \n \n But in high school I was against them as it was not my clothing style after freshman year at all. I got in with the goth crowd and the Gay Straight Alliance. I had friends. I lost a lot by then (my maternal grandmother who was more my mother than my mom and stuff I will leave out as I don't want to turn this debate into something other than what it's meant to be) but I had gained friends and people I could talk to. I fit in with my friends. I didn't need to fit in. I was and am a creative person. If I wasn't able to express myself through my clothing I would have had my sketchpad out and my hand drawing all day instead of me going to the classes I did and saving that for movies and study periods. \n \n Anyways, for me it depended on the school and when I had friends.",

   "I disagree, both school and society work best when people cooperate to achieve positive outcomes for everyone.\n\n \n BullXXXX. Throughout the history of mankind, have citizens of any civilization worth mentioning collectively accomplished anything? No. Even the elections demonstrate that citizens will never work together to make a collective accomplishment. Every accomplishment throughout history was mostly made by either an individual, or a relatively small group of people. You can't have greater levels of success by having the creative and ingenious dragged back by those who lack creativity and ingenuity.\n \n It's the way of nature. Those with good traits (work ethic, ingenuity, creativity, adaptability, intelligence, etc.) will succeed more than those without good traits. As brutal as it may sound, there are and always will be those who are simply better than most others. Those people, given the right opportunities, will become our politicians, our inventors, our businessmen, our professional people, our artists, etc.\n \n Why limit their success in the name of the \"common good?\" If everyone had been only supporting others and nobody had been having their own personal successes, we'd be living in the iron age, at best.\n \n \n\n Students actually learn best when they help each other and cooperate. Working in isolation is one of the least effective methods of learning. Collective identity helps foster respect, and behaviour is better when students feel that they have a collective reputation to uphold.\n\n \n You're confusing cooperation with collectivism. Just because people cooperate with one another doesn't mean they're a collective. \n \n What would be collectivism is if all students were working for a common grade, which would mean the teachers would average the grades and apply the average grade to every student, regardless of their personal achievements. Perhaps some smarter students would get somewhat higher grades, but part of their grade would be determined by the less successful students, and their academic success would be stunted. How much sense would that make?\n \n One of my favorite quotes, again:\n \"There is all the difference in the world between treating people equally and attempting to make them equal.\" &#8211; Friedrich Hayek \n \n \nUniforms contribute to this.\n\n \n And that's exactly why I'm against them.",
