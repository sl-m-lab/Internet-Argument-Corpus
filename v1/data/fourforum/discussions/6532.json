Citizens are naturalized or natural born.\nThat's been the customary point at which protection of the state is granted, although 'citizenship' often implies the ability to formally participate in public decisions (at least in democracies). Society evolves; at one time we did not allow slaves, indentured servants, or women the right to be full citizens, and now the question is whether the protection of the state should be extended to the unborn. It's always been a legal gray area because public opinion has been so strongly against it that no laws were required, but now that the question has come up - particularly the public financing of it through welfare - that the decision properly belongs in the political arena, not the legal arena.",

The case didn't establish a 'right to abort' it said that the state couldn't stop a woman from getting one.\n \n When the Court uses a precedent, it doesn't have to be a case about the same thing, but simply a related case. Griswold was related because it established that a woman could decide whether or not to bear a child, and that absolutely applies after conception and to the abortion issue. It has nothing to do emanations and penumbras. That is how the Court is supposed to work.\n \n \n\n I see that the \"emanations\" and \"penumbras\" that that guided Griswold are still with us.

You have to have an amendment giving the gov't the power to interfere with a woman's pregnancy, I don't have to have one to prevent them. The Constitution guarantees that any power not listed in itself the gov't does not have, and any freedoms not listed within itself the people have. There is absolutely no Constitutional support for a national ban. I challenge you to find it :)\n \n \n\n We were doing just fine as a nation when the issue was left up to the states.\n\n \n ... abortion laws were fairly recent, from what I've read.

It would be within the Supreme Courts authority to rule that State law unconstitutional (nowadays at least) even if there was nothing at all mentioned in the Constitution about voting. Under the equal protection clause of the 14th, laws must apply equally to all citizens. Of course you would cry \"OMG they created a right\".\n \n It isn't analogous because they were eligible for every Constitutional right when they met the criteria for citizenship. My point is that there was nothing preventing women to vote in the Constitution and all the rights in the Constitution applied to women because they met the criteria. That they were prevented by other laws is besides the point. A fetus doesn't even meet the criteria.\n \n Strictly speaking, an amendment wasn't needed to allow women to vote since the equal protection clause can be interpreted to allow women to vote. A clear amendment was needed so that the Court couldn't interpret anything other than women having the right to vote.\n \n \n\n Abortion was following that path, until the court derailed it.

Two would be to look at \"evolving standards of deceny\" and at the time of roe, how would they have known who supported abortion rights? They take a vote? A poll? Seems like we are getting into legislative grounds here. As an aside, I don't believe the courts get to decide what is a fundamental freedom. The legislative has pretty much already done this.\n \n \n\n There's little I can say if you disagree with the last 100 years of decisions.\n I'm not sure it was 100yrs..but close. Pretty much since we got a Governor as the chief justice. \n \n \nConversely, where does the Constitution of the United States forbid abortion?\n it doesn't talk about abortion...thus left up to states.\n \n \nIn other words, it's another one of those indirect but inevitable logical consequences of what's in the constitution. You're making the same mistake as before, just at a different level. Just because the line leading from the bill of rights to privacy to abortion requires a greater attention span than that of a three-year-old to follow doesn't make it any less real.\n logical consequence? Where do yo uget this stuff from? \"The only possible reason why we have specific things in the constitution regarding privacy is because the founders and later legislative body were too stupid to actually realize the word \"privacy\" can be put into the document. Not only that, no one realized it was there for a good 100yrs. But out of no where, the Supreme Court comes and says \"look!!! if take all these amendments and look at their common bond it makes a kind of right to privacy. Wow, this is amazing. The legislative is just slowly putting the right to privacy in so we will just speed up the process and declare there to be one\". Wow, what a great Supreme Court we have.

It isn't some mysterious code they put in there to see if people were too stupid to realize it being there. You then go on to say they were implicit in prior court decisions...well, besides this not being true, the court decisions are not the constitution. So i'm not sure what connections you are looking for? Are we connecting the dots or something? Maybe connecting amendments together to mean something they don't mean.\n \n \nWhen the constitution says that states may not declare war by themselves, it follows logically that they may not hire mercenaries to prosecute wars on their behalf. It would be irrational to argue that the constitution doesn't explicitly mention mercenaries. Similarly, if you had actually read Griswold v. Connecticut you'd know that it refers (among others) to Boyd v.

If so, you're living in a dream world. The right of privacy is real, and guaranteed by the constitution even if it's not mentioned by name.\n\n \n Griswold mentions the Boyd case ONE time I might add. Then griswold states that \"The Fourth and Fifth Amendments were described in Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 630 , as protection against all governmental invasions \"of the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life\" I like the quote they gave from Boyd which actually was a quote from someone else. All this aside, I believe Justice Black said it best..\n \nThe Court talks about a constitutional \"right of privacy\" as though there is some constitutional provision or provisions forbidding any law ever to be passed which might abridge the \"privacy\" of individuals. But there is not. There are, of course, guarantees in certain specific constitutional provisions which are designed in part to protect privacy at certain times and places with respect to certain activities. Such, for example, is the Fourth [381 U.S. 479, 509] Amendment's guarantee against \"unreasonable searches and seizures.\" But I think it belittles that Amendment to talk about it as though it protects nothing but \"privacy.\" To treat it that way is to give it a niggardly interpretation, not the kind of liberal reading I think any Bill of Rights provision should be given. The average man would very likely not have his feelings soothed any more by having his property seized openly than by having it seized privately and by stealth. He simply wants his property left alone. And a person can be just as much, if not more, irritated, annoyed and injured by an unceremonious public arrest by a policeman as he is by a seizure in the privacy of his office or home.\n \n One of the most effective ways of diluting or expanding a constitutionally guaranteed right is to substitute for the crucial word or words of a constitutional guarantee another word or words, more or less flexible and more or less restricted in meaning. This fact is well illustrated by the use of the term \"right of privacy\" as a comprehensive substitute for the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against \"unreasonable searches and seizures.\" \"Privacy\" is a broad, abstract and ambiguous concept which can easily be shrunken in meaning but which can also, on the other hand, easily be interpreted as a constitutional ban against many things other than searches and seizures. I have expressed the view many times that First Amendment freedoms, for example, have suffered from a failure of the courts to stick to the simple language of the First Amendment in construing it, instead of invoking multitudes of words substituted for those the Framers used. See e. g., New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 293 (concurring opinion); cases collected in City of El Paso v. Simmons, 379 U.S. 497, 517 , n. 1 (dissenting opinion); Black, The Bill of Rights, 35 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 865. For these reasons I get nowhere in this case by talk about a constitutional \"right of privacy\" as an emanation from [381 U.S. 479, 510] one or more constitutional provisions. 1 I like my privacy as well as the next one, but I am nevertheless compelled to admit that government has a right to invade it unless prohibited by some specific constitutional provision. For these reasons I cannot agree with the Court's judgment and the reasons it gives for holding this Connecticut law unconstitutional. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAt the time, some states did allow it. As I recall, about 40% of the population lived in states that allowed abortion to one degree or another and the number had been increasing for some time. A proper court would have shown judicial restraint and allowed the question to continue working itself out in the public arena, but the activist court decided to get ahead of the pack and race to the answer. If Roe is overturned, the issue will be returned to the states and society can continue to evolve normally.\n Yeah, it was like 38 states that restricted abortion to pretty much all but the \"hard cases\". So if they were to go by that \"tradition\" you would think they would have found it to be the other way.",

In it are included codes for abortion. Under that abortion reference in the index of the ICD-9-CM, it records \n ''abortion, illegal (homicidal)''. And that refers to any trimester, any time at all. Right in black and white, the diagnosis codes that physicians and hospitals use to describe the diagnosis for patients who have had an abortion \"outside of the medical professionals control\", describes abortion as the medical profession classifies it... homicide! I ask, ''if an ''illegal'' abortion is a homocide, according to the medical profession, what would make a ''legal'' abortion not a homicide''? A homocide is a homicide no matter who performs it. The only difference is that doctors make money on ''legal'' abortions, so how and why would they say that the abortions they perform are homicidal? They wouldn't, of course. That would be ''shooting themselves in their own foot''. So, if the medical profession calls abortion ''homicide'', who is anyone else to argue that fact? I know I'm not qualified to argue that fact. After all, who can disagree with the ones who perform the ''legal'' homicides? If you have any doubt about what is put forth in this paragraph, and before you make any reply in ignorance, please consult a medical ICD-9-CM book which is available to the public through many channels. Oh. And if you don't like the fact that the medical profession classifies abortions as homicide, you could always take up an argument with the American Medical Association. (Those are the folks who write the ICD-9-CM). Is homicide legal or constitutional?",

   "You're quoting selectively again. The exact phrase is \"construed to deny or disparage....\" It's a way of saying that rights not enumerated in the text of the constitution may exist and may not be denied under that constitution. If the authors of the constitution had intended for it to be the kind of document that the so-called originalists claim it is, there wouldn't be a ninth amendment. As I said, they knew what they were doing and did it for a reason, and for you to assume otherwise is to reveal your contempt for this country's basic institutions.\n NO what it says is that the list of rights in the constitution can't be construed to deny or disparage to deny other rights. So the question becomes...under your view...why did they construe a right given in the constitution to make a blanket right to privacy. No one said it was one of those rights....cause there is no way to prove that...they just contrued an amendment to say so. This aside, could we make one of these \"rights retained by the people\" a blanket right to life?

   "Supposing you are correct in saying that the ninth amendment says that rights not enumerated in the text of the constitution may exist and are still protected under the constitution, is there any limit to the quantity of those rights? I mean, it seems to me that reading the ninth amendment that way gives license for somebody to grant whatever rights they feel like granting.\n\n That's a reasonable observation, and to a certain extent correct except that the \"somebody\" is not the courts. In other words, any state can grant its citizens new rights not mentioned in the federal constitution, but they can't take away rights mentioned there. At the federal level, the legislature may do the same. The courts may not and, by and large, do not. What the courts do is apply reasoning to what the constitution and statutory law do say, working out their logical consequences as they apply to particular cases or areas of application. Sometimes, admittedly, they do have to stretch a little, because they have to render a decision and the laws are often sketchy. They can't wait for new laws (especially where that would violate the sixth amendment) so they do they best they can.\n \n Sometimes they screw it up. I think Kelo and Grokster were both decided wrongly, for example, and I've written about both on my website. I also happen to think Marbury v. Madison went astray when it went from showing how the Supreme Court may overrule a law as it applies to a specific case to (purportedly) giving the Court authority to reject a law in its entirety. However, I think that overall they get it right and in all but a very few cases they were trying to interpret and not make law. The complaint about \"activist judges\" \"legislating from the bench\" is mostly fiction. It's just not the right kind of activism for some people, and not the result they want, but that's because those people don't understand or don't respect the constitution and the Court's role within it.\n \n1) I would assume that steeeeeve is taking the same line as you are here: mainly that he likely believes, just as you do, that he is defending the country's basic institutions, not expressing contempt for them. So I think that implying otherwise just isn't fair.\n\n I have two answers to that. The first is that at a certain point incompetence becomes indistinguishable from malice. We as citizens have a responsibility to understand how our government works and support that even if we don't like some of the outcomes it provides. There is always room for legitimate criticism, but Steeeeve's objections have been based on such a litany of misrepresentation that they cannot be taken as good faith.\n \n My second answer is that I'm trying to make a point. I'm sick of hearing how the left and/or the Court are trying to destroy everyone's sacred liberty, when in both cases they are trying to preserve it. I think that accusation applies at least as much to the right, and it's good to see that the point has been made. If you want the accusations of hating freedom to stop, start taking Steeeeve and Diogenes and Basxhole and the other wingnuts to task for them. They're still way ahead in that department. Don't complain just because my accusation has more substance than theirs.\n \n2) It doesn't seem likely that somebody who is constructing an argument based upon the constitution is doing so in order to express their fundamental contempt for our country's basic institutions.\n\n But Steeeve's arguments are not based upon the constitution. They are based on a misrepresentation - or, at best, highly selective reading - of the constitution. He denies things that are clearly in there - about the nature of rights, about the role of the Court, etc. and he denies the clearly expressed intent of the framers that reason should be applied to the constitution even as he bleats about originalism. He may love the constitution that exists in his own mind or that of the pundits he prefers, but that constitution is so different from the one that actually exists that he cannot love both. As I've pointed out, to disparage a necessary conclusion is to disparage an axiom, and Steeeeve's attitude toward the effects of the constitution being as it really is does seem to be marked with contempt.",

A state may grant rights not in the Constitution to the citizens of the said state, so long as those rights granted do not violate a specific prohibition within the U.S Constitution.

However, when a citizen of the State challenges State law, the case is under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court (read Article III). They then have the authority to decide whether the State law is Constitutional. They decided it was not in Roe.\nAnd they decided wrongly, by drawing inferences that should not have been drawn. It was not a rational decision, where the reasoning leads to the conclusion; it was a decision with the argument created to rationalize it.\n \n \nI do know this. You keep missing my point, the Constitution did not forbid either group from having full rights (with the possible exception of counting slaves as 3/5ths of a person). Neither group is analogous to a fetus not having rights, because a fetus doesn't even meet the criteria while both women and blacks do. That womenwere prevented by State laws is besides the point, and any laws preventing them should have been struck down by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional.\nWhat are you talking about? How is the Equal Protection Clause and saying that women should have the law applied equally to them as to men assigning words whatever meaning suits my purpose?\nVoting eligibility was left up to the individual states as one of their prerogatives.

The only defenese for this Platypus has showed is that Griswold said a right to privacy exists because other courts have been hinting towards it (yet none of them found it to be there). For this he sites a case sited in Griswold that (that was only mentioned briefly and misquoted at that) merely said something about privacy. Realizing that the 4th amendment just won't cut it, he moved on to the 9th amendment which has been shown to provide no help as well. But back to the 4th amendment. Let us just quote it directly so Platypus doesn't accuss me of misrepresenting again.\n \nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n Now what Griswold did was take the first part (secure persons, houses, etc..) and then combine it with a subsitute for \"unreasonable search and seizure\". Griswold said that it can be easily assumed that this really can mean privacy. Justice Black was correct in pointing out that using privacy instead really just misrepresents what the amendment is for. Can one unsecure someones house so long as it is not privatly done? How many witnesses do I need to make it public? Maybe a news crew? However, griswold didn't just say the 4th amendment had privacy but rather a \"zone of privacy\". Like the first amendment means freedom to associate...which is privacy? Lets replace the word to the definition....\n \n I have the freedom to join or union together with others.\n I have the freedom to be free from unsanctioned intrusion.\n \n Anyone wanna tell me how those are one in the same? Now the ability to be able to associate with others without having the government intrued on you might be considered a \"privacy\" act. However, not only is this not absolute, but you could use any other word beyond privacy. For the 4th and 1st amendment, couldn't I use the word \"interference\". Not the same as privacy but will \"work\" for both. Or instead of interference why don't we use the word \"freedom\". Oh wait, WE DID. Freedom is used for a reason and privacy is left out for a reason. The only \"penumbra\" coming out of all the amendments is \"freedom\" and this can't be replaced with \"privacy\" even if it is similiar in some areas. Just face it, a blanket right to privacy doesn't exists in the constitution. A concept of freedom does but privacy can only be used in some cases and doesn't work for others (like someone invading your home in public).",

Let us just quote it directly so Platypus doesn't accuss me of misrepresenting again.\n\n If you don't want to be accused of misrepresentation, stop misrepresenting everything in sight. You could start by not trying to misportray my argument as \"realizing the 4th amendment won't cut it\" etc. My argument all along has been that the right to privacy results from a combination of provisions. It's a little thing we like to call logic - A and B, therefore C. If an integer is greater than six and less than eight then it must be seven, even if it's not explicitly stated to be seven. The fourth- and fifth-amendment provisions regarding seizure of property, combined with the ninth-amendment injunction against not disparaging other rights, defines a territory in which no conclusion that denies a right to privacy remains possible. I'm sorry if that's too complicated for you.\n \nNow what Griswold did was take the first part (secure persons, houses, etc..) and then combine it with a subsitute for \"unreasonable search and seizure\". Griswold said that it can be easily assumed that this really can mean privacy. Justice Black was correct in pointing out that using privacy instead really just misrepresents what the amendment is for.\n\n Your mistake, along with many others', is in considering \"search and seizure\" only in a law-enforcement context where the two are combined. What about other kinds of seizures? Here the fourth only underscores what is more explicit in the fifth - \"nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\" The repetition, which occurs often in the constitution, illustrates how it represents a coherent system within which interpretation should occur. Your \"originalism\" disassembles that system into a set of unrelated parts that may not be connected or extrapolated as logic would dictate, clearly contrary to the intent of the founders. They intended the constitution to be a foundation on which more sophisticated legal and social structures could be built, not as the be-all and end-all forever limiting jurisprudence to simplistic terms and conclusions.\n \n Oh, and thanks for falling into that trap. Maybe if you were more inclined to think about the issues instead of attempting to \"score points\" where you think your favorite pundits have left you well prepared (they haven't) that wouldn't keep happening to you.",

   "With that sort of generalization, the Second Amendment could be construed to allow citizens to be armed with everything up to and including nukes. Do think that's likely to happen?\n\n \n The case certainly could be made for that, but this argument must be tempered by a few things. The second amendment reads: A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. \n \n Firstly, the founders never anticipated the sheer destructive power of a nuclear weapon. Given the unacceptable (to all reasonable people) risk to citizens, it is reasonable to say that nukes are outside the perview of the 2nd amendment.\n \n Secondly, the intent of the amendment was so ordinary citizens could rise up against an oppressive gov't (if you do not see that, there is no hope for you). This logically would then allow ordinary citizens access to military grade weapondry of the sort an oppressive gov't would use to oppress us. Nuclear weapons are exteremly unlikely to be used to oppress citizens; additionally, the intent was that we were to be able to fight back and there is no fighting back against a nuke even were we to have them ourselves. You die. That's all. Therefore it is reasonable to say that nuclear weapons are outside the perview of the 2nd amendment.\n \n Thirdly, ordinary citizens are unlikely to have the equipment to maintain a nuclear weapon, leaving them soley in the hands of a rich minority, something the founding fathers would never have intended. Therefore it is reasonable, though not as strong in this case, to say that nukes are outside the perview of the 2nd amendment.\n \n Fourthly, how do you know you cannot own one? The material to fuel it is hazardous and restricted for private ownership, I believe, but the shell might be salable. I've never tried.\n \n I honestly think the amendment needs to be changed to reflect this, however the fanatics that form the base of the Republican party would go insane if anyone even mentioned changing it, the fanatics that form the base of the Democratic party would want to go to far and restrict virtually all weapons and our representatives don't want to disturb the status quo unless they have something to gain by it. So we are left with what we have and the Court provides us the happy medium where the fanatics get to keep their guns and everyone else is secure in the knowledge that when the apocalypse comes the guys with the guns will kill each other off :)\n \n The 14th is a lot more general than the 2nd. The 2nd, while it can be interpreted this way and that, deals with guns. The 14th deals with freedom, which is a much more abstract and general subject. There is really little comparison.",

It was not a rational decision, where the reasoning leads to the conclusion; it was a decision with the argument created to rationalize it.\n\n \n I don't agree, obviously. However, whether or not you think they were wrong, they had the authority to decide this case.\n \n \n\n Voting eligibility was left up to the individual states as one of their prerogatives. In both cases, society evolved to grant rights and privileges to members that had previously been denied those rights and privileges. In both cases, the matter was clarified by a Constitutional amendment adopted by means of the process specified in the Constitution.\n\n \n It clarified, but was not strictly required. Once the 14th amendment was ratified, no state could Constitutionally forbid one group of citizens the right to vote while protecting another group of citizen's right to vote under the Equal Protection Clause (and probably elsewhere in the Constitution if I cared to look). The amendment was necessary so that bigots could not interpret it any other way.\n \n Women were always eligible for Constitutional rights because they meet the requirements of citizenship. Fetuses do not meet the criteria, and thus are not eligible for any Constitutional rights. Women did not need an amendment specific to them to have equal rights, fetuses do.\n \n \n\n Are you seriously suggesting that the finest legal minds of the time (ca. 1870-1920) overlooked such an obvious argument? Obviously one of us has no idea how the Constitution is supposed to work...\n\n \n So tell me why the Equal Protection Clause would not have worked?

   "I am a professional medical coder. I would like to expose something regarding the medical field that few people, who are not part of the medical field know. It is this. The medical profession recognizes abortion as homicide. Let me explain. The ICD-9-CM, is the coding format that every physician and hospital in the United States uses to code diagnosis for every condition and disease that a human being can have. In it are included codes for abortion. Under that abortion reference in the index of the ICD-9-CM, it records \n ''abortion, illegal (homicidal)''. And that refers to any trimester, any time at all. Right in black and white, the diagnosis codes that physicians and hospitals use to describe the diagnosis for patients who have had an abortion \"outside of the medical professionals control\", describes abortion as the medical profession classifies it... homicide! I ask, ''if an ''illegal'' abortion is a homocide, according to the medical profession, what would make a ''legal'' abortion not a homicide''? A homocide is a homicide no matter who performs it. The only difference is that doctors make money on ''legal'' abortions, so how and why would they say that the abortions they perform are homicidal? They wouldn't, of course. That would be ''shooting themselves in their own foot''. So, if the medical profession calls abortion ''homicide'', who is anyone else to argue that fact? I know I'm not qualified to argue that fact. After all, who can disagree with the ones who perform the ''legal'' homicides? If you have any doubt about what is put forth in this paragraph, and before you make any reply in ignorance, please consult a medical ICD-9-CM book which is available to the public through many channels. Oh. And if you don't like the fact that the medical profession classifies abortions as homicide, you could always take up an argument with the American Medical Association. (Those are the folks who write the ICD-9-CM). Is homicide legal or constitutional?\n\n \n \n You want to get into law and the Constitution? Homicide is the killing of another person. By the 2nd amendment, all people have the right to a gun, right? Are you defending the right of a fetus to own a gun? Whether you agree or disagree with abortion it is not homicide.\n \n By the way, doctors DO NOT make money on legal abortions, place they work does. Doctors get a fixed pay, not based on the work they do.",

The Bill of Rights does not strictly apply to States unless it specifically states such, but incorporation through the Due Process Clause (and through substantive due process) allowed many to be applied against the States(though not, interestingly enough, the Second). \n \n The Due Process Clause not only limits how the law operates but also what the law can prohibit, and helps protect the minority from being controlled by the majority. It was developed as an idea in the nineteenth century when many, including James Madison, realized that the Magna Carta, which the Due Process Clause was descended from, did not forbid Parliament from doing anything, but forbad the King from disobeying Parliament. The Courts do not have a list, but instead decide on a case by case basis whether a law requires 'strict scrutiny' of the State's justification or not.\n \n \n\n Without \"substantive due Process\" the courts really couldn't do anything because a law is \"due process\" .

The decision could have been made without any 'right to privacy', imo, though as you rightly point out it could not have been made without substantive due process. That was much more central to the decision.\n \n I have to do no such thing, since neither substantive due process nor 'right to privacy' were interpreted in Roe. You must dismantle substantive due process and the defense of laissez-faire economics that used it as a doctrine since it was first used in 1856, as well as dismantle the incorporation of the Bill of Rights against the States.\n \n \n\n The constitution can be easily looked at.

I said \"Preventing abortion through legislation legally requires women to remain pregnant.

If you have problems with precedents that were created by other cases, I don't know that I can help you.\n \n \n\n Convicted felons are denied legal ownership of firearms by the states, to one degree or another. The ban against private ownership of fully automatic weapons (and on up to WMD) is a federal one - but at least it is a law passed by the people and their elected representatives, and not a ruling passed at the whim of the court.\n\n \n And it is controversial because the Federal Gov't has no place infringing on the right to bear arms with the auto weapon ban, whether or not it was passed by \"the people and their elected representatives\".\n \n \n\n Constitutional arguments in support of this position have to rely on originalist thinking that these weapons were not in contemplation at the time the amendments were adopted.\n\n \n And are you not an originalist?

The Court had jurisdiction, you simply disagree with them. Unless you can point out where they used precedent or procedure incorrectly, you have no factual basis.\n \n \n\n I very much doubt that any state would ban it completely, but there would be differences in the circumstances under which it would be allowed, differences in the requirements of parental notification and/or consent in the case of minors, and the like.\n\n \n This is already the case. Roe ends at viability.\n \n \n\n Those differences are a matter of public policy, and should be resolved in the political arena as society evolves. I question your polls, because the ones where I've seen the questions are usually loaded questions which do not allow for nuances and a variety of options.\n\n \n Then you haven't been paying attention very much. Polls have been address in this forum before. Click here. Here are some highlights:\n \n \n\"Whatever your own personal view of abortion, do you favor or oppose a woman in this country having the choice to have an abortion with the advice of her doctor?\"\n % \n Favor 69 \n Oppose 24 \n Don't know 7 \n\n and\n \n\"The 1973 Supreme Court decision called Roe v. Wade made abortion in the first three months of pregnancy legal. Do you think the Supreme Court should overturn Roe v. Wade or let it stand?\" \n\n \n The formating won't come over too well, but the answers to the second question are 26% in favor of overturning, 59% in favor of upholding and 15% are not sure.\n \n \n\"The United States Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision in 1973, called Roe versus Wade, which legalized abortion. Generally speaking, are you in favor of the Supreme Court decision which permits a woman to get an abortion from a doctor at any time, or are you opposed to that, or are you indifferent on the subject -- or haven't you heard enough about that yet to say?\" \n\n \n Again, the formatting won't come through. \n \n The answers were: 46% in favor, 11% indifferent, 37% opposed, and 6% either didn't know or didn't know enough. They also broke it down by party, these are combined totals. The majority of people support the Roe decision.\n \n \n\n And of course I disagree with your selective choice of philosophy (i.e., situational ethics) for interpreting the constitution in different cases. Society evolves as the times change, and it is up to the people to adapt the constitution to meet the evolution. That is the whole purpose of the amendments, and is illustrated by all of the amendments from 11 on.\n\n \n And what of the Second?
