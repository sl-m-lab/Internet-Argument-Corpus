   "Abortion, It's an unspeakable tragedy.47 million babies have died since January 22, 1973 as a result of an unconstitutional supreme court decision. That number is higher than the population of some countries. That would be wiping out a number of whole states. The world was appropriately horrified and shocked when we lost about a couple thousand people on Sept. 11.... What we're talking about here is that sort of loss multiplied dramatically but in this case we are killing our own people.\n \n Most of the people reading this right now have consciences that are seared by growing up in societies where death is the default rather than letting someone live. Its just a normal thing to them. This to me only reveals their lack of knowledge on the subject, but also their lack of moving past preconceived ideas that they get from their own intellect and actually asking the question, \"do i really care about human life or do i just only care about my own?\"\n \n Our society needs to put in context the enormous amount of loss that we've suffered -- the enormous amount of intelligence, the enormous amount of creativity, the enormous amount of productivity. This is genocide and we have to stop it.",

   " \"It is kinda hard to know the numbers prior to that...\"\n\n \n That isn't an acceptable excuse...numbers that tally legal abortions aren't even accurate either. \n \n \n \n\n \"...but he was giving a date in reference to the supreme court case. To infer anything beyond that is not needed.\"\n\n \n It is unless you personally feel legal abortions only kill a human being. This is what the poster implies; only fetuses killed by legal abortion matter, never criminal ones. So why did the poster only provide the number aborted since Roe v Wade? Shouldn't we incorporate all abortions? \n \n \n \n\n \"For example if you say \"10,000 people died in a car accident last year\" you don't downplaying the ones that died in 2004\"\n\n \n But you know it is more then just that. The poster gave a specific date that is relevant to when abortion was legalized. It shows the poster is being selective and may hold prejudice to fetuses who aren't aborted by legal abortions. You see, it is the pro-life movement's selective outrages that makes me think they aren't serious about abortion as a whole. \n \n \n \n\n \"Why does this matter? Is this your own personal view of what a person is?\" \n\n \n No, this is more of an ethical stand point. A fetus is incapable of feeling outraged or offended by being aborted then why is it an outrage by others to begin with? The only party that stakes out a vital rule in condemning abortion is the fetus...and unfortunately for that minority the fetus is a neutral party. \n However clinical signs of life do define us as a living person. Not conception. So no living people is being aborted...at least in the majority of abortion cases.",

   "No, this is more of an ethical stand point. A fetus is incapable of feeling outraged or offended by being aborted then why is it an outrage by others to begin with? The only party that stakes out a vital rule in condemning abortion is the fetus...and unfortunately for that minority the fetus is a neutral party.\n However clinical signs of life do define us as a living person. Not conception. So no living people is being aborted...at least in the majority of abortion cases.\n\n I would first like to note that I haven't read the rest of the thread since you posted this...\n \n That being said, is this your own personal view point of why a fetus is not a human or person? If so, why do you think that viewpoint should be inflicted upon others...mainly the fetus. Secondly, you talk about clinical signs of life and claim that the unborn is not a living person (a fetus would be as it has signs those brain waves and heart beats to which I believe you are referring to). If the early unborn is not \"living\" then we either have dead or doesn't exist....or if you want to refer to \"life\" and \"death\" as human entities then your claim would leave that the unborn is dead, non-existent, or part of another such as a liver. The unborn is not dead though as something that is dead for 9 months doesn't come back to life normally. The unborn surely exists as we are talking about he/she. The unborn is not a liver or a heart as he/she has its own set of DNA and in fact does seperate from the mother after 9 months and lives...if you take your liver out after 9 months it will not live. \n \n In the end, how can you claim something is not a human when you can't establish what a human is. I obviously can't go around saying everyone from Canada is not a human and then claim that the people from Canada have no say in deciding this because they aren't human. It comes down to what is reasonable field of things we should call human. Since you can't pinpoint exactly when it happens it is probably best to go from the earliest point a human is growing another human to the point of death. I doubt you would find one person that thought it might be earlier than that (in other words 100% of people think that life and death begins somewhere between conception and death)....that seems like the most reasonable and fair approach.",

   "I wonder how many people care about the principle and how many actually care for all those people.\n \n You see, it's easy to condemn the \"killing of innocents\", especially in the rhetoric. However, actually caring for all those people is quite another thing. Caring about them means thinking about programmes to help poor families. it means thinking about low cost schooling. It means thinking about counteracting the employers' monopoly and eliminating the \"reserve unemployed pool\". This is what caring for all those people is.\n \n And if we were to extend this a bit, we get to thinking about aid to Africa and other third world countries, where overpopulation is a serious issue. It means thinking of all those \"illegal aliens\" that will do ANYTHING to get to the \"promised land\".\n \n Seen from this point, I think people don't really care about all those dead.

   "I'm new to the forums and I can be both liberal and conservative depending on the issue (pro death penalty, but pro choice for example).\n \n Basically there's really only one thing I can pick at pro-life people, because they have some good arguments definitely. And in all abortion debates I participate in, I refuse to debate when a baby is alive or if the baby has rights or any of that stuff that's ridicously open to intrepretation based on the individual. The one thing that bothers me however is pro life advocate's innate sense of self-righteousness. If you're pro life, you believe that people getting abortions are obviously murdering babies. That belief can be reasonably justified I suppose, but the fact of the matter is, it's not you that's getting an abortion. So let a girl (and perhaps with support from her boyfriend) go get an abortion and soil her/their hands with \"murder\" and let them be damned to hell or whatever. \n Pro life people appear to be afraid either that someone they aren't being \"good\" and letting babies be killed or they are somehow better than everyone else and have the right to interject and \"save\" the \"lives\" of babies. On a personal level, go slap happy advising your friends not to get an abortion because you think it's bad. That's ok, why? Because you care about your friends and your friends' unborn kids. But the second you start wanting amendments/laws dictating for the entire nation, you are now essentially just looking down at complete strangers and playing Jesus or some other savior, in an effort to make yourself feel better that you did something \"good\" and \"right.\" And you know what, perhaps you guys are right, and abortions are awful in the eyes of God or some other code of ethics, but I would rather kill a kid before she/he is anywhere close to consciousness than let them suffer a life of poverty, abuse and general despair (this is assuming obviously poor, unchangeable conditions, which isn't always the case for everyone pondering an abortion, I realize that), even if it means I hurt my own reputation/karma, because I just don't want my kid to suffer like that.\n As to the argument about killing potential future talented people, that's a rather illogically cynical view of humankind. Perhaps the abortion that my friend just got ended the life of a modern day Beethoven, but that's not to say there is absolutely no chance of a modern day Beethoven being born by someone else, somewhere else. That's like saying since that one baby who hasn't even been born yet, much less decided on a career path, was, is and will be the only one ever in all of eternity who could be a modern day Beethoven. It doesn't bother her because it wouldn't make sense to be bothered. That's like getting a glance at some person once at a party, then going home and crying because you missed out on the love of your life. Even if an all seeing entity knows that person is the one, you as a person do not since you never even talked to them and got to know them.",

   "Oh and to answer the topic question, yes I do really care about human life.

Also, if you consider this attitude selfish, it doesn't matter to me because this system of caring about the people you know and that's it actually works to maintain a healthy society because everyone has people they want to look out for. It's not like your friend who I don't know needs me to care about her potential abortion or not, it's you who needs to advise her (if you so choose to advise her at all).
