That's more than five defenseless animals every day. Not counting the dogs and cats PETA spayed and neutered, the group put to death over 90 percent of the animals it took in during 2005 alone. And its angel-of-death pattern shows no sign of changing. \n \n ....\n On its 2002 federal income-tax return, PETA claimed a $9,370 write-off for a giant walk-in freezer, the kind most people use as a meat locker or for ice-cream storage. But animal-rights activists don't eat meat or dairy foods. And during a 2007 criminal trial, a PETA manager (testifying under oath) confirmed the obvious -- that the group uses the appliance to store the bodies of its victims. \n \n In 2000, when the Associated Press first noted PETA's Kervorkian-esque tendencies, PETA president Ingrid Newkirk complained that actually taking care of animals costs more than killing them. \"We could become a no-kill shelter immediately,\" she admitted. \n \n PETA kills animals. Because it has other financial priorities. \n \n PETA rakes in nearly $30 million each year in income, much of it raised from pet owners who think their donations actually help animals. Instead, the group spends huge sums on programs equating people who eat chicken with Nazis, scaring young children away from drinking milk, recruiting children into the radical animal-rights lifestyle, and intimidating businessmen and their families in their own neighborhoods. PETA has also spent tens of thousands of dollars defending arsonists and other violent extremists. http://www.petakillsanimals.com/petasdirtysecret.cfm",

   "IMO in the US a lot of the problem is that they make it such a pain in the butt to \"adopt\" and animal that people don't watn to mess with it.\n \n I was looking for a rat terrier a while back and went to the local shelter. To adopt a dog, there was a $170 fee, you had to fill out a 4 page application, and they had the right to come visit your home anytime they wanted for the next four years. I have taken out loans for several hundred thousand dollars that involved less paperwork and asked less invasive questions. Eventually I ended up just buying a puppy for $100. Less hassle, less money, no problems. \n \n If shelters want to adopt out anumals, they need to pull their heads out of their collective butts and make it EASY. Walk in, point at the one you want, walk out with it. The argument seems to be that they want to ensure that the animal will be kept humanely. At the local shelter, they are basically kept in concrete boxes until either they are adopted or killed. Real humane. At least if you let them walk out the door with somebody that have a CHANCE. Any chance is better than none.",

Babies take the same risk when they are born. If the alternative to taking a chance is killing the animal or keeping it in a shelter its entire life, take the chance. \n \n Can you imagine the outrage if I showed up at a hospital nursery and announced that I intended to kill any baby who did not have what I considered to be suitable parents...or if we decided to keep babies whose parents did not meed our standards? People would be bouncing off the walls at the mere suggestion that it might be more humane to kill a baby than to sentence it to a life with its crack whore mother. \n \n \nwe have adopted 4 dogs from a lady who ran almost single handed an animal rescue organisation.
