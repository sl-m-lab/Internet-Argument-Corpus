   "So begins what promises to be another epic flame thread. emoticon_xhoho\n\n \n Want to bet how fast a creationist here is going to try change the subject? \n \n It's still a valid point though. You don't see the kind of anti-evolution bull**** posts on the reviews for textbooks like you do for political/religious books. And this applies to other online sellers too. That to me says that creationists aren't going to respectable sources to learn about a theory they declare false, instead getting their information from politics and religion. Going through Campbell's biology 7th and 8th editions, people are moaning about high costs, poor structuring, and how heavy the book weighs. \n \n Interesting how those who decry evolution don't take their argument to the textbooks that teach it.",

John William Dawson (1868) described a classic Carboniferous-age locality at Joggins, Nova Scotia, where there are upright giant lycopod trees up to a few metres tall preserved mainly in river-deposited sandstones. These trees have extensive root systems with rootlets that penetrate into the underlying sediment, which is either a coal seam (i.e. compressed plant material), or an intensely-rooted sandstone or mudstone (i.e. a soil horizon). Dawson considered and rejected anything but an in situ formation for these fossils, and his interpretation is closely similar to current interpretations of sediments deposited on river floodplains. An interesting feature of these examples is the presence of vertebrate fossils (mostly small reptiles) within the infilling of the stumps.\n \n The reason I am using Dawson rather than a more recent reference is to emphasize that many supposed \"problems\" with conventional geology were solved more than 100 years ago using very basic principles. The people suggesting these \"problems\" exist are so out of date that even 19th-century literature refutes their presentations. \n \n\n \n Since the answer was shown to be answered in 1868, it shows that effort to use that 'conundrum'' is rather dishonest and ignorant.",

   "explain to me how creationists not writing reviews on some arbitrary book mean they're not educated\nCould it be that creationists don't actually read books on real science? Could it be that they lack the education to make any comment, intelligent or otherwise, about science text books?\n \n In fact, several polls, even those by fundamentalist, young earth creationist, George Gallup, have shown that there is a negative correlation between education and belief in creationism.

It explains that in detail.\n\n \n I assume that this little paragraph sums up what your point is.\n The trees grew there and were buried in a floodplain b4 they were able to rot. Not too difficult.\n Did they calculate the amount of water and sediments to bury the trees b4 they rotted, form the strata and form the coal?\n How big was this river?\n \n \"It is evident that when we find a bed of clay now hardened into stone, and containing the roots and rootlets of these plants in their natural position, we can infer, 1st, that such beds must once have been in a very soft condition; 2ndly, that the roots found in them were not drifted, but grew in their present positions; in short, that these ancient roots are in similar circumstances with those of the recent trees that underlie the Amherst marshes [these are local tidal marshes, some with recently-buried forest layers in the peat and sediment]. In corroboration of this, we shall find, in farther examination of this [stratigraphic] section, that while some of these fossil soils support coals, other support erect trunks of trees connected with their roots and still in their natural position.\" \n So yes I did read the article. It was long on agenda and short on explanation. \n Did you think the article through? or did you accept it as an explanation because you were 'told' to accept it?\n \n \n The figure 6 problem was not explained by a 'river' and they in fact offered no solution. They river here of course would have to be huge an trees would have to stand without decay for at least long enough for the next forest to mature b4 the next 'river' comes along and buries it again in sediments. 31 different times.\n At least they did NOT try to play that game.\n \n \"Some observers have suggested that the petrified trees originally grew on the hillside and thus give the impression of multiple layers of trees one above another.
