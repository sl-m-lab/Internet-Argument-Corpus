   "Yeh, cheap imports are the worst thing in the world.\n \n \nA PETITION From the Manufacturers of Candles, Tapers, Lanterns, sticks, Street Lamps, Snuffers, and Extinguishers, and from Producers of Tallow, Oil, Resin, Alcohol, and Generally of Everything Connected with Lighting.\n To the Honourable Members of the Chamber of Deputies.\n \n Gentlemen:\n You are on the right track. You reject abstract theories and little regard for abundance and low prices. You concern yourselves mainly with the fate of the producer. You wish to free him from foreign competition, that is, to reserve the domestic market for domestic industry.\n \n We come to offer you a wonderful opportunity for your -- what shall we call it? Your theory? No, nothing is more deceptive than theory. Your doctrine? Your system? Your principle? But you dislike doctrines, you have a horror of systems, as for principles, you deny that there are any in political economy; therefore we shall call it your practice -- your practice without theory and without principle.\n \n We are suffering from the ruinous competition of a rival who apparently works under conditions so far superior to our own for the production of light that he is flooding the domestic market with it at an incredibly low price; for the moment he appears, our sales cease, all the consumers turn to him, and a branch of French industry whose ramifications are innumerable is all at once reduced to complete stagnation. This rival, which is none other than the sun, is waging war on us so mercilessly we suspect he is being stirred up against us by perfidious Albion (excellent diplomacy nowadays!), particularly because he has for that haughty island a respect that he does not show for us [1].\n \n We ask you to be so good as to pass a law requiring the closing of all windows, dormers, skylights, inside and outside shutters, curtains, casements, bull's-eyes, deadlights, and blinds -- in short, all openings, holes, chinks, and fissures through which the light of the sun is wont to enter houses, to the detriment of the fair industries with which, we are proud to say, we have endowed the country, a country that cannot, without betraying ingratitude, abandon us today to so unequal a combat.\n \n Be good enough, honourable deputies, to take our request seriously, and do not reject it without at least hearing the reasons that we have to advance in its support.\n \n First, if you shut off as much as possible all access to natural light, and thereby create a need for artificial light, what industry in France will not ultimately be encouraged?\n \n If France consumes more tallow, there will have to be more cattle and sheep, and, consequently, we shall see an increase in cleared fields, meat, wool, leather, and especially manure, the basis of all agricultural wealth.\n \n If France consumes more oil, we shall see an expansion in the cultivation of the poppy, the olive, and rapeseed. These rich yet soil-exhausting plants will come at just the right time to enable us to put to profitable use the increased fertility that the breeding of cattle will impart to the land.\n \n Our moors will be covered with resinous trees. Numerous swarms of bees will gather from our mountains the perfumed treasures that today waste their fragrance, like the flowers from which they emanate. Thus, there is not one branch of agriculture that would not undergo a great expansion.\n \n The same holds true of shipping. Thousands of vessels will engage in whaling, and in a short time we shall have a fleet capable of upholding the honour of France and of gratifying the patriotic aspirations of the undersigned petitioners, chandlers, etc.\n \n But what shall we say of the specialities of Parisian manufacture? Henceforth you will behold gilding, bronze, and crystal in candlesticks, in lamps, in chandeliers, in candelabra sparkling in spacious emporia compared with which those of today are but stalls.\n \n There is no needy resin-collector on the heights of his sand dunes, no poor miner in the depths of his black pit, who will not receive higher wages and enjoy increased prosperity.\n \n It needs but a little reflection, gentlemen, to be convinced that there is perhaps not one Frenchman, from the wealthy stockholder of the Anzin Company to the humblest vendor of matches, whose condition would not be improved by the success of our petition.\n \n We anticipate your objections, gentlemen; but there is not a single one of them that you have not picked up from the musty old books of the advocates of free trade. We defy you to utter a word against us that will not instantly rebound against yourselves and the principle behind all your policy.\n \n Will you tell us that, though we may gain by this protection, France will not gain at all, because the consumer will bear the expense?\n \n We have our answer ready:\n \n You no longer have the right to invoke the interests of the consumer. You have sacrificed him whenever you have found his interests opposed to those of the producer. You have done so in order to encourage industry and to increase employment. For the same reason you ought to do so this time too.\n \n Indeed, you yourselves have anticipated this objection. When told that the consumer has a stake in the free entry of iron, coal, sesame, wheat, and textiles, ``Yes,'' you reply, ``but the producer has a stake in their exclusion.'' Very well, surely if consumers have a stake in the admission of natural light, producers have a stake in its interdiction.\n \n ``But,'' you may still say, ``the producer and the consumer are one and the same person. If the manufacturer profits by protection, he will make the farmer prosperous. Contrariwise, if agriculture is prosperous, it will open markets for manufactured goods.'' Very well, If you grant us a monopoly over the production of lighting during the day, first of all we shall buy large amounts of tallow, charcoal, oil, resin, wax, alcohol, silver, iron, bronze, and crystal, to supply our industry; and, moreover, we and our numerous suppliers, having become rich, will consume a great deal and spread prosperity into all areas of domestic industry.\n \n Will you say that the light of the sun is a gratuitous gift of Nature, and that to reject such gifts would be to reject wealth itself under the pretext of encouraging the means of acquiring it?\n \n But if you take this position, you strike a mortal blow at your own policy; remember that up to now you have always excluded foreign goods because and in proportion as they approximate gratuitous gifts. You have only half as good a reason for complying with the demands of other monopolists as you have for granting our petition, which is in complete accord with your established policy; and to reject our demands precisely because they are better founded than anyone else's would be tantamount to accepting the equation: + x + = -; in other words, it would be to heap absurdity upon absurdity.\n \n Labour and Nature collaborate in varying proportions, depending upon the country and the climate, in the production of a commodity. The part that Nature contributes is always free of charge; it is the part contributed by human labour that constitutes value and is paid for.\n \n If an orange from Lisbon sells for half the price of an orange from Paris, it is because the natural heat of the sun, which is, of course, free of charge, does for the former what the latter owes to artificial heating, which necessarily has to be paid for in the market.\n \n Thus, when an orange reaches us from Portugal, one can say that it is given to us half free of charge, or, in other words, at half price as compared with those from Paris.\n \n Now, it is precisely on the basis of its being semigratuitous (pardon the word) that you maintain it should be barred. You ask: ``How can French labour withstand the competition of foreign labour when the former has to do all the work, whereas the latter has to do only half, the sun taking care of the rest?'' But if the fact that a product is half free of charge leads you to exclude it from competition, how can its being totally free of charge induce you to admit it into competition? Either you are not consistent, or you should, after excluding what is half free of charge as harmful to our domestic industry, exclude what is totally gratuitous with all the more reason and with twice the zeal.\n \n To take another example: When a product -- coal, iron, wheat, or textiles -- comes to us from abroad, and when we can acquire it for less labour than if we produced it ourselves, the difference is a gratuitous gift that is conferred up on us. The size of this gift is proportionate to the extent of this difference. It is a quarter, a half, or three-quarters of the value of the product if the foreigner asks of us only three-quarters, one-half, or one-quarter as high a price. It is as complete as it can be when the donor, like the sun in providing us with light, asks nothing from us. The question, and we pose it formally, is whether what you desire for France is the benefit of consumption free of charge or the alleged advantages of onerous production. Make your choice, but be logical; for as long as you ban, as you do, foreign coal, iron, wheat, and textiles, in proportion as their price approaches zero, how inconsistent it would be to admit the light of the sun, whose price is zero all day long!\n \n ----\n \n Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat (1801-1850), Sophismes \u00e9conomiques, 1845\n\n \n If cheap shoes are bad, surely free sunlight must be even worse. It's \"Dumped\" in America half of every day.\n \n The idea it is good to send things abroad, and bad to get them sent in is moronic. If you could export nothing and yet import half the world, you would become rich beyond reckoning without work.\n \n \nYou have stumbled into the truth. It certainly not the same as \"collapse.\"\n\n \n Yes, it has different emotive content, that is, it makes you feel bad. You prefer the truth to be sugar coated.",

   "China revaluing its currency vs the US dollar would in all likely hood have very little impact on the US trade deficit now or in the near to intermediate future.\n \n Other then the truely cheap consumer items, ( pots, pans etc) China's exports to the US are generally only assembled in China. These items are not likely to be built or assembled in the US at any rate, to high a cost structure in the US. \n \n When China does go to a fully floating currency ( within two years in all likely hood) China would actually benifit if as the US government says China' Yuan is undervalued. Imports of oil, steel, raw materials in general would be cheaper for China and its consumers, further leading to productivity growth in China.\n \n \n As for the US and its economic policy, I do believe that its goal is to inflate away its problems of large debts and overvalued assets. A steady and relatively slow hidden decline in the standard of living for many Americans will be missed by many Americans more caught up in the last episode of the Simple Life. The US generally cannont allow the high priced US assets fall in value and keep any of the future promises to retirees ( hello baby boomers ). That the future promises in todays real dollars will be far lower will be missed by those same baby boomers.\n \n \n As for the likelyhood of the current US administration of being able to perform this tricky task correctly, I have my doubts. With almost no strong economisits or good business people on board, the probablity of a serious error in economic policy being passed through ( say for a short term boost in 2006 for the elections) is much stronger, especially as Greenspan (the great balancer ) is retiring very soon.",

   "Let me try this again. If all of the taxes are collected that should be collected, it can and should result in a tax decrease to the rest of us who DO pay our taxes. If the government needs $2.7 Trillion to run its operation, getting an additional trillion from the tax cheaters or non-payers can by law reduce taxes on the rest of us by the like amount. You do like lower taxes, do you not? Based on your reasoning, you evidently enjoy paying higher taxes than would otherwise be necessary. I don't.\n \n As to China, that's a huge market that cannot be ignored. It is in our national interest that the currency be fairly valued.\n\n \n I understand your thinking, I am just less optimistic about the odds of the government implementing tax cuts in the event that such a thing took place. I think you are looking at this from the wrong side (JMO). We need to be looking more at how much we are spending as opposed to how much we are collecting, or how much is potentially escaping collection. Ideally, we need to see how much we are collecting, then make some kind of effort to reconcile that number with our spending (balance the budget).\n \n Currently, with well over $70 trillion in unfunded federal obligations (and that is the conservative number) not including debt service, ANY tax cut is frankly foolish. Look at the original tax cuts by the bush administration. While they did a really neat job of increasing GDP, since GDP is just a count of transactions with no real meaning in a non industrialized economy, the trade deficit also increased proportionally (above its expected increase) because people used that new money to run out and buy a bunch of imported ****.\n \n While I am certainly all for lower taxes (I could have bought a new house with what I paid in federal taxes last year), I only want it if it is not going to be at the expense of my children. While I realize that shrugging off responsibility and passing the buck to the next generation has become the norm, I really don't agree with it, since you are essentially stealing from your kids, and frankly I have too much integrity for that.",

   "http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Global_Economy/GD20Dj01.html\n \n \n Now for some of the positive and negative effects of the fast rising assets prices, in this case specifically in the US from this article.\n \n \nThe southern California housing crisis, of course, has a sunnier side as well. In the past five years median home values have increased 118% in Los Angeles and an extraordinary 137% in neighboring San Diego. Homes, as a result, have become private automated teller machines (ATMs), providing their owners with magical, unearned cash flows for purchasing new sports utility vehicles, making down payments on vacation homes, and financing increasingly expensive college educations for their kids. Second mortgages and home refinancings, according to a Wharton Business School survey, have generated an astounding US$1.6 trillion in additional consumption since 2000\n To me the use of second mortgages for anything but asset diversification is idiotic, and yet it appears that many people are using them to support thier lifestyles.\n \n [quote]The current US housing bubble is the bastard offspring of the stock-market bubble of the mid-1990s. Housing prices, especially on the west coast and in the east's Bos-Wash (Boston-Washington, DC) corridor, began to rocket in the second half of 1995 as dot-com profits were plowed into real estate. The boom has been sustained by sensationally low mortgage rates, thanks principally to the willingness of China to buy vast amounts of US Treasury bonds despite their low or negative yields. Beijing has been willing to subsidize US mortgage borrowers as the price for keeping the door open to Chinese exports.[quote] \n \n \nThe bubble has already burst in San Francisco, and the April 11 issue of Business Week headlined fears that a general deflation - perhaps of international magnitude - is nigh. What will life be like in the United States (or Britain or Ireland) after the home-equity ATM shuts down? \n \n The business press, as always, reassures passengers that they are headed for a \"soft landing\", a slowdown rather than a crash, but even a mild jolt may be sufficient to end the current anemic recovery and throw all the dollar-pegged economies into recession. More ominously, some eminently respectable Wall Street economists, like Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley, have been warning of a dangerous negative-feedback loop between the foreign-subsidized housing bubble and the huge US trade and budget deficits. \"The funding of America,\" he has written, \"is an accident waiting to happen.\" \n \n \n\n \n This is the first time I have heard the bubble bursting in San Fran, but generally not suprised",

   "\n \n As for the US and its economic policy, I do believe that its goal is to inflate away its problems of large debts and overvalued assets. A steady and relatively slow hidden decline in the standard of living for many Americans will be missed by many Americans more caught up in the last episode of the Simple Life. The US generally cannont allow the high priced US assets fall in value and keep any of the future promises to retirees ( hello baby boomers ). That the future promises in todays real dollars will be far lower will be missed by those same baby boomers.\n \n \n As for the likelyhood of the current US administration of being able to perform this tricky task correctly, I have my doubts. With almost no strong economisits or good business people on board, the probablity of a serious error in economic policy being passed through ( say for a short term boost in 2006 for the elections) is much stronger, especially as Greenspan (the great balancer ) is retiring very soon.\n\n \n That's current administration thinking, 'elastic' debt absorbed by inflation. Bush booted O'Neil as sec treasury because he understood the ramifications of unlimited debt on creditworthiness and the American consumer in the form of diluted currency and made the mistake of voicing his rational opinions. No way to win an election. Instead of a graceful decline in US standard of living for the masses, they're in for some unpleasant surprises. Those people who are mentally plugged into a cheap dollar lowering product costs are as gullible as they were about WMDs. But they refuse to believe the masses of cheap US dollars out there won't be used to totally bury what remains of US manufacturing, so let them continue their attempts of mentally resurrecting the 'good old days' of the American Dream as promised by their politicians. They'll need something to occupy their minds. Even Greenspan is again harping on deficits and debt, which means maybe he's trying to regather some shreds of his reputation for history books before retirement.",

   "Oh, please. Take a ride down to the local Honda dealer and look at the Accord. It is made in Marysville, Ohio. I own two near new Fords and they have been near perfect. Toyota is almost an American company with eight plants here. Nissan's new pick-up is 85% domestic content. \n\n \n Yes, and then all production profits go back to japan. We don't care about overhead prices, those are just shifting money from the consumer to the assembly worker. What we need to keep are the PROFITS, and preferably PROFITS that are generated overseas. For every car that Toyota builds and sells here, our trade deficit widens. It widens slower than it would if they were building them overseas (since in that case the labor costs would be going to Japanese workers instead of American workers), but it still widens. These companies built plants here under threat of tariff. They (wisely) calculated that when you consider shipping costs of a vehicle, and the proposed tariffs on imports at the time, it was cheaper to pay the US labor rate and then purchase raw materials overseas from wholly owned subsidiaries at an inflated price in order to screw the federal government out of their piece of the pie. From a practical standpoint, we probably would have been better off to keep their production overseas, require that they use US shipping companies, then impose a tariff at the dock. \n \n National wealth is created though value added manufacturing. The Japanese are taking all the \"value added\" and leaving with it.\n \n \nOur \"foreign policy?\" What does that have to do with this? \n \n \n Do you rememebr a couple months ago when there was the big explosion in Iran and there was conjecture that it may have been a US strike? The dollar dropped over 300 pips in 3 minutes, then hovered there until we were certian it was NOT a US strike. Besides being a pretty good indicator of what the rest of the world thinks about the odds of a US victory in a war in Iran, it si an excellent example of how our foreign policy, even when you are not talking foreign economic policy, effects our economy.\n \n \nOur \"out of control national debt?\" At 64% it is about in the middle. Japan's is twice ours. Our deficits do matter but at the current time our debt to GDP is not unmanageable.\n\n \n The difference is that the Japanese have a dedicated revenue stream to repay their debt, and a positive trade balance. Additionally, they have reserves that equal nearly their entire debt. So, why do they issue debt instead fo using those cash reserves? Simple. Their long term bonds generally run between 1.3 and 1.6%. They invest thier reserves in higher paying bonds, and essentially make money on their debt. Currently, US bonds (long term) are running between 4.3% and 4.6%. So, they hold onto their cash, sell bonds at 1.5%, then invest their cash in US bonds at 4.5%, and make 3% on the deal.\n \n A little smaller scale example....\n \n Last year I bought a new minivan for hauling the kids around. Total price was $21,400.00. I had the $21,400 in savings, but opted to finance the van instead. In fact, I charged it on a Citibank card that has a fixed interest rate of 1.2%. I then took the $21,400 out of savings and put half of it into my forex account, and half of it into my standard brokerage account. It has been a good year, and that $21,400 has shown a profit of 44.15%. I effectively MADE 42.95% by financing the van instead of paying for it out of pocket.\n \n This is what the japanese are doing with their debt.",

   " To me the use of second mortgages for anything but asset diversification is idiotic, and yet it appears that many people are using them to support thier lifestyles.\n\n \n BUT, that is what people have been doing. The recent low interest rates have had the effect of increasing second mortgages and home refinancing by a huge amount. \n \n \nThe current US housing bubble is the bastard offspring of the stock-market bubble of the mid-1990s. Housing prices, especially on the west coast and in the east's Bos-Wash (Boston-Washington, DC) corridor, began to rocket in the second half of 1995 as dot-com profits were plowed into real estate.

Beijing has been willing to subsidize US mortgage borrowers as the price for keeping the door open to Chinese exports.\n \n \n There are 2 problems presented here. The first is the 3 trillion dollar housing bubble, which represents over 10% of total US real estate value. Each half point we raise interest rates effectively prices about 8% of prospective buyers out of the market. Additionally, it puts roughly 8% of those who have already purchased their homes on variable rate mortgages in houses that they cannot afford. 4.5% by the end of the year. Let me say that again for clarity 4.5% BY THE END OF THE FRIGGING YEAR. Couple that with massively increased energy costs, add a dash of negative wage pressure, and top it off with crippling credit card debt. the homeless shelters are going to be busy this winter.\n \n The second problem with that is that the minute it becomes unprofitable for the chinese to prop up our economy, they will stop. The second they find alternative markets to move their goods to, or the US finally reaches that point where they have to invest more in floating us than they get out, they will stop. BOOM over. One day. No gentle decline. Suddenly, we cannot finance our debt.

We issue more debt to service our debt, like consumers paying credit card interest with new credit cards or expanded credit lines. \n 5. Ford is experiencing the same liquidity and product rejection (other than light trucks and SUVs, now also declining in sales) problems as GM. Chrysler was bailed out by the government and aborted most of their excessive cost labor and benefit contracts at that time. Otherwise Benz would never have purchased them. Benz has also replaced a majority of Chrysler's senior management to break the fiefdom mentality that pervades GM and Ford.

What stays here will flow into the system and disappear until the standard of living for workers reaches the point of employees of a US owned facility in Mexico.

It had its desired effect, which was to curb the fall of the dollar ont he back of such dismal numbers. Like nearly everything else he said in the speech, it was a lie. the consumer is only the winner as long as the consumer still has money to spend.\n \n I don't know why this concept is so difficult for peopel to grasp. Whent here is no more money left in our country, that is a BAD thing. If we keep sending more money out than we take in, there will eventually be no more money left int he country, which is a BAD thing. \n \n If you have a basket of apples, and every day you take out 2 and put back one, eventually the basket will be empty.

I fail to understand how you can claim that a net los to the coutry is a good thing. Keep it up, though.\n \n So far my ROI this year across the board has been nearly 60%. For every dollar I make, someone, somewhere looses one. How do I do it? I assume that politicians lie, the dollar is going to fall, and the numbers will be bad. then it is just a matter of math.

   "Sure, there is economical benefit to the country in question, but if the company is alien to that nation (meaning based and founded in another nation), the net profits almost always flow back to that nation and the respective stockholders. \n \n Look at microsoft. It operates in virtually every decent market, and look where the money is flowing back into: the US. \n Or the golden arches. McDonald's exists everywhere. Yet all of the net profit is reinvested into the company or given as a dividend to the respective owners, which are a majority in the US. The net profit flows back into the country of origin. Look at Lloyd's of London. They will insure anything if you have the right assets. Where does that money flow back to? The owners of Lloyd's of London. Or let's consider Koch Industries. A privately owned colgoermate that is estimated to be worth high triple digit billions. It operates all over the world, yet where does the net profit ultimately collect? in the account of Koch and his investors. Sure, there is economic benefit to the country of operation, but the net profit almost always flows back to the country of origin, which usually has the largest number of owners either private or public.\n \n What my first post is merely how accounting has been done for decades. \n As for economics, Kensyian economics is still be taught. What has died in most schools is Supply Side. If we must discuss that, there is economic benefit to both the country of operation and the country of origin. while there may be zero economic profit (different from financial accounting remember), oh boy, here comes the jargon, the company in question wouldn't be operating in the country of orgin unless there was a chance for profit. There is no reason for that company to keep the profit in the country of origin. Any investments that came from the retained earings (btw, I'm using accounting and economic terms at the same time so try to keep up) are not counted in net profit, which i believe you are confusing. The company invests and usually causes benenficial economic outcomes, but that is counted in the assets of the company, not daewoo's \"production profits\" which he is substituting for net profits. \n \n Remember net profit is gross profit - operating expenses, and those expenses include wages.",

I don't care if you trade the same amount of money back and forth ten million times, it's originally provided from within and doesn't increase in size, period.

You either export products or locate your product production to take wealth from another country or don't replace the wealth, an eventual fiscal dead-end.

If the ROI, stockholder after-tax profit, is 10% and it leaves the country, you're left with $9, which means the $1 can and will be redeemed by another country, leaving your government with $9 of the issued $10. \n \n Forget capital investment. The country paying for the product is not getting any return on that capital, it gets jobs that generate sales providing the capital investors their profit. So you have all these jobs, with each $10 of goods produced being reduced by $1. Then your government has to print more money to make up the $1 taken out of national wealth. Do that enough times and that $1 is worth less each time its printed as your government has to pay interest to generate that new dollar, making it worth $1 less the interest cost. Do that enough times and the game becomes your government scraping up enough interest money to service the debt on all those new dollars.

A 100% of nothing is still nothing. Those people had nothing. Now they have their wages, the multiplying of the money throughout the fledgling economy and the long-term investment of the foreign capital.\n\n \n When we locate factories in other nations, especially unindustrialized nations, we do so for the cheap labor.

US companies build factories there, and hire workers at slave labor prices (which is pretty good pay for the are) to make clothing, that they ship back to the US and sell at wally world. We are creatign exports for that nation. \n \n What you are loosing sight of is the fact that the end consumer pays all costs. Your textile mill in indonesia is paid for by the end consumer, as are all the labor costs involved. This means that an American consumers dollars are going to pay an indonesian workers salary. That is money going into indonesia, and staying there, that started out in an american pocket. It is a net gain for indonesia, a net loss for america. The net profit ends up in pocket of the American company, but since those are American dollar to begin with, that is economically neutral. \n \n The situation you describe as far as japanese auto makers locating factories in the US is ENTIRELY different. The automobiles produced in America are slated solety for the domestic market. Foreign automakers do NOT make cars in the US to ship to other countries. This means that the end consumer is American. Since yourr end consumer pays all cost associated with production, that means that American dollars are being used to pay American workers wages. That is economically neutral. It is merely american dollar shifting around inside the country. It neither increases nor decreases the total amount of money in the country. \n \n The net profit, though, goes back to Japan.

That's the only way you can analyze company performance using operating profit as a component of return on assets and capital without diluting the calculation. A company might have a bad quarter or three but still be a strong performer and if only net profit (dividend) per share is used they (income taxes and extraordinary expenses) wouldn't be visible as a line item buried above the line. That also provides footnote justification to define material items affecting net income. If you're taking a really close look at a company, burying expenses or income taxes above the line will also distort standard percentages by industry for operating expenses and stand out like a sore thumb.
