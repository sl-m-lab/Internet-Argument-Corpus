   "Evil tricks about plums\n The evil tricks of some conspirators or hegemonies are not really soothing to our non-altered souls. How they give birth to our fleshes and our nerveless souls waiting to purify. AS they know that we are hungry or thirsty then they mentioned that there are pabulums or plums were ready in some where. I just realized that wafer and holly lily was not better than hamburgers\n It was our ancestors who struggled and sacrifice for us and these are given being. Hatred and love stimulated and surround us so we are obligated to struggle for living on. We hope for better days but needed not to be so painful always as to go to heavens to prove there could no lies or liars ever there. Our ancestors live in human -lairs not paradises. We hunt or eaten by other animals and this is the basis of our life. What are our fleshes. Not matter how fantastic is holly gases and mud but we called them cells and tissues. Further division will be used to call them codes or nuclear or atoms.\n Finally Gods give no equal for men and women and also human to animal so this is why they are competed for fitness. If we accept true love that will mean that we have to subdue and submit to our masters. The way of Gods is the ways of every strong people. If true love is for example having dropped off some honors then every Gods are not our masters. At first there are two main classes that were our Gods and Adolf then what happened now is just a logical extension of powers and minds. \n There came Kings and peoples. We also have ginseng and radish also soldiers and whores before we have a flourishing populations. Finally your God is a sexism who is not complete with the highest-ranking concubines. No teddy girls are so foolish as to be conceived for God s kisses. Do you know why some supreme free matters create Christ because they are so foolish and set all nuts free. I have been stupid Gilbert stop hanging on Christ and there are no more stones in my trysts that are dreadful. Thank you the free matters which create Gods then in turn support condoms that are full of the smells of flowers. Jesus make flowers grow from stones instead of a verbal loving condom. When Jesus dead on an erected cross that is his bed he did not cried out straight but did he groan for pleasures of our salvations. He spoke mainly of his father but not mother. This does not mean that he was not subdues to death otherwise he was not to forgot the tenderness of his mother. When some body face death he will forgot all his happiness .So Jesus hope for the mercy of giant penis but not beautiful soft vagina. His head is by his father s legs not by his mother s legs\n Sorry for women Christ is like Shakspares who had mentioned: \" women your name is weakness.\" Sexism is some of our anarchic periods but also that might be the sins of our Christ. Why always the outmost God is male. What is the meaning of our muscles. Do Gods power mainly relay on that. Are Jesus feel shame before his mother. To my words Jesus death is the anatomy by my observations that is the faults of the ancient society for a half manic leader of Israel.
