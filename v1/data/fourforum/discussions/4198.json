   "I am not sure what you are asking. Is money necessary to provide education? Of course. \n First, I admire anyone with the courage to run for or sit on a school board. I live near a major Texas city with a $billion dollar school budget. About 60% of the students are Hispanic, 30% are black and the remaining 10 % are whites, Asians and a few other ethnicities. Of roughly 100,000 Hispanic students, about half do not speak English well or at all, causing a huge drain on resources. It is not going to happen, but I would like to see English as the official language used in school curriculum's and public documents. If English becomes official, perhaps our President, who had the benefit of a very expensive education, can at last grasp the true meaning of the word \"illegal\".\n Sorry to wander from the subject, but it is related somewhat.\n Dono",

First of all there's the fact that if rich people donate to the school, it will have more resources and be a better school.

Lastly, if a person is rich, they likely had a good education and understand the importance of a good education.

Very similar, but not quite the same. \n And as said before, it matters A LOT when it comes to how the money's spent.\n It's a vicious circle. A lot of the good teachers are going to be at the rich schools because they're paid more. Now I know there are a lot of VERY good teachers who prefer to work at lower income schools, because it's 'their calling', or they do it for the student, or they love the job, if you will. At the same time, the rich schools are only going to hire the best.

   "Regarding money buying happiness\n \n I tend to see money as both freedom and security. It offers the individual the freedom to pursue his/her dreams and whishes. It also offers personal security from many of the ills and hardships that life throws at you. This is why income and wealth distribution is so important. If money had merely been a luxury item, there would have been no need have the government involved\n \n Regarding money buying education\n \n I agree that education should be viewed as any other good (or rather investment) and that individuals should be free to spend their money however they want. There is however one dicouraging aspect of education as an investment. Generally education is viewed as an investment in the way that it increases the students productive capabilities, and therefor results in a higher wage for the individual once the education is completed. If more money spent on education means a sharper increase of the students productive capabilities and consequently a higher wage increase, all is good and well. However, it is not certain that this view of education is correct. One could also view education as a signal system where completed education signals a highly productive individual rather than creating the excess productivity. If this signal effect is significant, one could question how much individuals (and society) should spend on education as it doesn`t create much other than competativity for the sake of competition. For the individual, it might still be profitable to invest heavily in education (in order to come out on top), but this would only encourage others to invest more, etc etc. And instead of increasing the international competativity and productive capabilities of the workforce, you end up with a bucketload of squandered resources and years wasted on internal competition. \n \n \n Hmmm... did I get off tangent? :p",

When the western world is unable to compete with other countries like China and India for industrial production due to high wages, one need to find a way to justify the wages economicly. By investing resources in the populace, one could hope to achieve higher productivity overall. This is in stark contrast to the theory of education as predominantly a signal tool. In order to be able to achieve this higher overall productivity, education needs to be a real investement that actually increases productivity rather than merely showing who is allready productive to begin with. I hope that the human-capital theory (as it is commonly called) is correct. But I fear that the signal theory might become more and more \"accurate\" for certain educations and jobs. I don`t really know how one could reverse this process though, but perhaps it would be appropriate to re-consider the government funding for certain non-productive educations in order to direct resources to those that actually makes a difference in economic/political opportunities and work-force productivity. Making it less attractive (and necessary) for students to pursue two (or three) diplomas/examinas could perhaps go a long way too...",
