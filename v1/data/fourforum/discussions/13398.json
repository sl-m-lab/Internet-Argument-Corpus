In Chapter Four, the authors noted that &#8220;None of the rifles, shotguns, or handguns connected with this study were obtained from gun shows or related activities.&#8221;\n \n About ten years ago, another study for the Justice Department revealed that less than one percent of armed criminals got their guns from gun shows. \n\n \n   Results of the USDOJ study about gun shows \n\n Meanwhile, a study released by the Justice Department suggesting background checks at gun shows would do little to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals. \n \n The study noted the number of criminals who obtained guns from retail outlets was dwarfed by the number of those who picked up their arms through means other than legal purchases. The report was the result of interviews with more than 18,000 state and federal inmates conducted nationwide. It found that nearly 80 percent of those interviewed got their guns from friends or family members, or on the street through illegal purchases. \n \n Less than 9 percent were bought at retail outlets and only seven-tenths of 1 percent came from gun shows.\n\n They are criminals.
