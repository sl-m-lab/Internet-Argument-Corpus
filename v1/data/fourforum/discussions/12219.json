Israeli Jews are firmly behind the government&#8217;s conduct of the war, with the human rights groups representing a small minority.\n The good news is that the majority of Israeli's understand the propaganda game being waged against them, and they support hitting the terrorists where their weapons are fired from. Their attitude is, if the Palestinians don't care about their citizens enough to protect them from the line of fire, and consciously place them in harms way for their propaganda value, then why is it Israel's responsibility to worry about them during a shooting war? The answer is, it isn't. Here is a paper written by another famous American liberal regarding the game Hamas is playing with the lives of their innocent citizens. Here's an excerpt from that paper:\n The Hamas war crime strategy\n \n By Mr. Dershowitz, law professor at Harvard. Hudson, January 8, 2009.\n \n As Israel persists in its military efforts - by ground, air and sea - to protect its citizens from deadly Hamas rockets, and as protests against Israel increase around the world, the success of the abominable Hamas double war crime strategy becomes evident. \n The strategy is as simple as it is cynical: provoke Israel by playing Russian roulette with its children, firing rockets at kindergartens, playgrounds and hospitals; hide behind its own civilians when firing at Israeli civilians; refuse to build bunkers for its own civilians; have the TV cameras ready to transmit every image of dead Palestinians, especially children; exaggerate the number of civilians killed by including as \"children\" Hamas fighters who are 16 or 17 years old and as \"women,\" female terrorists.\n \n Hamas itself has a name for this. They call it \"the CNN strategy\" (this is not to criticize CNN or any other objective news source for doing its job; it is to criticize Hamas for exploiting the freedom of press which it forbids in Gaza). The CNN strategy is working because decent people all over the world are naturally sickened by images of dead and injured children. When they see such images repeatedly flashed across TV screens, they tend to react emotionally.\n \n Rather than asking why these children are dying and who is to blame for putting them in harms way, the average viewer, regardless of their political or ideological perspective, wants to see the killing stopped. They blame those whose weapons directly caused the deaths, rather than those who provoked the violence by deliberately targeting civilians. They forget the usual rules of morality and law. \n For example, when a murderer takes a hostage and fires from behind his human shield, and a policeman, in an effort to stop the shooting accidentally kills the hostage, the law of every country holds the hostage taker guilty of murder even though the policeman fired the fatal shot. The same is true of the law of war. The use of human shields, in the way Hamas uses the civilian population of Gaza, is a war crime - as is its firing of rockets at Israeli civilians. Every human shield that is killed by Israeli self defense measures is the responsibility of Hamas, but you wouldn't know that from watching the media coverage.\n \n The CNN strategy seems to work better, at least in some parts of the world, against Israel that it would against other nations. There are many more protests - and fury - directed against Israel when it inadvertently kills fewer than 100 civilians in a just war of self defense, than against Arab and Muslim nations and groups that deliberately kill far more civilians for no legitimate reason. The Hamas war crime strategy - Likud of Holland / Likoed Nederland\n \n If you had any sense of justice or balance at all, you would recognize and acknowledge the responsibility which falls squarely on the shoulders of this terrorist group for the human carnage it is causing. But like a blind man you lash out at the IDF for simply defending itself against the rockets fired from those locations where civilians have been placed as sacrificial lambs to allah, the demon god they worship. Which of course explains why you side with the terrorists. How proud you must be to defend those who refuse peace as you condemn those who took thousands of unanswered rockets before responding to end these unending rocket attacks from these terrorists.",

This has resulted in eight (8) Israeli deaths.&#8221;\n \n So in fact, according to Israeli sources, 23 Israelis have been killed by Occupied Palestinian mortar and rocket attacks.\n\n \n My numbers are a little different. And the harm done goes much deeper than just the dead and injured since these are acts of terror.\n Massive rocket fire against Sderot and the Western Negev commenced in January 2001, and has caused significant damage to homes and property, while injuring 433 Israeli residents and traumatizing thousands of adults and children.\n \n 22 people have been killed in the Western Negev region by the rocket attacks, including 9 residents of Sderot, three of whom were children.\n \n Qassam rocket fire poses a major threat to Israel from Palestinian terrorist organizations who are based in Gaza. As of January 2008, over 8,000 rockets have been launched at Sderot and the Western Negev. \n And I thought you were worried about civilians and specifically children? Why doesn't that concern include the 8000 rockets which have been fired at civilian communities for the past 8 years? Where is your compassion for the truly innocent who haven't done anything to deserve to live in fear every day of their lives? Are you aware of the affects of that on the children? Do you care about them?\n MENTAL HEALTH: The mental health of Sderot residents has severely deteriorated over the past seven years as each rocket attack results in psychological turmoil. In the past year and a half more than 1,600 instances of stress were reported. Approximately 70% of Sderot residents suffer from signs of post traumatic stress disorder which include extreme stress and anxiety. According to a recent Natal report, between 70% to 94% of Sderot children show symptoms of PTSD. The Natal study found 28 percent of adults and 30 percent of children in Sderot actually have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n \n Approximately 3000 patient files have been opened in the Sderot Mental Health Center due to the rocket fire environment. In the year 2007 alone, 1,117 trauma victim files were opened, up significantly from 2006. Anxiety symptoms among children often include sleeping difficulties, nightmares, sweating, development regressions, wetting beds, and fear of the outside. There are only 4 psychologists on call in Sderot. Therefore, many Sderot trauma victims do not receive the proper, if any, psychological therapy and care.\n How long is Israel expected to subject their people to this without responding in force with one goal in mind? That goal being to permanently stop these attacks once and for all time? Wouldn't any weaker a response just prompt these terrorist to continue on as they have since no degree of talking has ever accomplished anything lasting or real? Are you so bigoted against Jews that you will support terrorists if that's what it takes to accomplish your hateful goals? \n \n AND WHY IS THE ONLY ARAB ON THIS FORUM, ONE OF THE ONLY PEOPLE WILLING TO STAND UP AND DEFEND ISRAEL AGAINST THESE OBVIOUS CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY WHICH THEY HAVE SUFFERED UNDER FOR SO LONG BEFORE RESPONDING WITH FORCE, WITH NARY A MENTION FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY? ARE EVEN THE JEWS HERE AFRAID TO SPEAK UP FOR THEIR OWN PEOPLE AND COUNTRY?",

There are also plenty of UN resolutions making it quite clear the Israeli settlement of the West Bank and Gaza is unacceptable, and the UN charter specifically recognises the right to self-determination, which must necessarily include not being subject to military occupation. If you want to claim that Israel was legally founded based on UN decisions, then you must also accept that the decisions when they are against what Israel is doing. Otherwise we can go back to 1948 and ask why Israel was, by means of terrorism, allowed to appropriate a chunk of Palestine and expel most of the lawful residents.",

Would they continue to kill all the innocent, poor, angelic civilians?

Didn't they democratically VOTE to empower Hamas? Doesn't voting for people who lob rockets INDESCRIMINATELY obligate you towards the consequences?\n \n 4) There is no question Hamas is INDESCRIMINATELY firing rockets. They are. So this obviously means their tatget is RANDOM. How is this NOT terrorism?\n \n 5) There is no question Isreal is targeting SPECIFIC ACTS OF MILITANCY. It just so happens, these militants are hiding behind the PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR THEM. Since they are firing at military targets, (hiding behind civilians) how is this terrorism? You can't honestly believe they shouldn't fire when civilians are near, right? How would this NOT invite a barrage of rockets from every hospital, mosque, and school in Gaza? Hamas is firing from these places UNDER FIRE! What do you think would happen if they didn't have to worry about that small problem?\n \n If Hamas is indifferent to their targets, and indifferent to who dies when they are targeted, WHY ARE YOU HOLDING ISREAL TO A DIFFERENT STANDARD? \n \n The world knows who the terrorists are.
