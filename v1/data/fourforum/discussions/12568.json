   "Think about this. If a man wants to have sex with a woman, he will more likely do so if he knows the woman can just get an abortion. If abortion remains legal, more men will continue to use women as simply sex objects. The man will have no responsibility, as even if \"safer sex\" practices do not work, abortion is always the back-up escape plan.\n \n If abortion were illegal, men would not be as likely to use women as objects for sexual pleasure.

Unless he really loves the woman and wants to be with her, he will have absolutely no desire to pay for a child for any portion of his life.\n \n It takes both a man and a woman to have a child. Over 90% of the time both are willing to have sex, and nothing is forced upon the woman. Only 1% of pregnancies are a result of rape. The woman can just say NO.

Is it right for a man to simply want women for sex? Is that right? Don't women deserve respect for their sexuality? If you cannot see the wrong in men only desiring sex, and nothing else from a woman, you have a serious problem.\n \nWhy shouldn't two peole who are attactive to each other have sex?\nPeople cannot just go have sex with any person they want. They have to make a commitment to care for the child that may result. That is why. Imagine a world where all that matters is sex, and children are devalued? There is nothing wrong with two people having sex, but in doing so they must make the commitment to care for the child that will result from their actions. Its called responsibility. Having an abortion is the easy way out, a path that is provoked by the lack of caring for anyone else but oneself. For both the man and the woman. Should I have had sex with my 16 year old girl friend in high school? Why not? We were both attracted to each other? If that really is your logic, then any sense of morality you may have had is completely lost.\n \nWho are you to say that, if it results in a pregnancy, that you know better than the pregnant woman how to determine the future of that pregnancy?\n\n Not the future of the pregnancy, the future of the CHILD. The future of the developing human being who has the opportunity to live, which is better than death before birth can even be achieved. The woman made a choice to have sex with a man. She should have known that a child would be a possible outcome. If she did not want to have the child, all she had to do was practice abstinence. Then there would be no issue of what to do with an unwanted pregnancy.\n \nWhat is it that makes you think that your word should be law in the universe?\nMy word as law? Why should any murder be illegal? The reason is because people come to understand what is fundamentally right and what is inherently wrong. People who rob banks often need money to support their families. But it is not right to rob a bank. Other people are involved. Abortion is similar to a robbery, but the life of the baby is stolen instead of money.\n \n I understand where you are coming from. You believe that everyone should be able to choose whether or not they think abortion is wrong. You believe that if a woman thinks abortion is fine, she can go through with it. But that is not what I believe. That is not what millions of Americans believe. We believe that a fetus is a human life. We cannot rest our consciences until that life is protected, just as all human life deserves to be protected.

There are numerous ways to support this claim, I will start out with the following:\n \n Men having sex with women will produce children. With abortion legal, abortion thus becomes another option. So let us review the statistics of the number of births in the United States during the years 1960 and 2005.\n \n According the the census of 1960, there were 4,257,850 live births.\n \n According to 2005 data, there were 4,138,349 live births.\n In 2005 there were also 1,200,000 abortions.\n Add that up and you get roughly 5,338,349 pregnancies in the year 2005, and 4,257,850 pregnancies during the year 1960.

When the goal not to get pregnant fails, they simply end the result of the pregnancies as the back door.\n A man skydiving has a parachute because he does not want to get killed. The man is not killed if the parachute fails because he has a backup parachute. The backup parachute allows him to achieve his main goal of living. An abortion does not stop a woman from getting pregnant. But that is simply another strawman argument.\n \nWrong. See, this is where it helps to check some numbers.

   "Congratulations on once again basing your arguments on the personal attack fallacy.\n\n None of my arguments are based on this observation. Not a single one. It's simply an observation, and one that's spot on.\n \n \nEvery issue involves people \"thinking\". Don't tell me you don't think about anything?\n\n And you accuse me of building strawmen? I did not say not to think; I said that your claim was not one that can be justified merely with thought. You made a positive claim about a worldly cause; that position requires evidence for it, not just a willy-nilly thought experiment about how it conceptually could be true.\n \n \nMen having sex with women will produce children. [snip]\n\n Apparently, I've got children, because I've had intercourse with the opposite sex. Lakrite says that's what happens. Thing is, I'm pretty sure I would have noticed.\n Please check the other active thread for my comments about gross oversimplification, which has bitten you right in the XXX once again. And I don't mean with just this statement; I mean with the rest of the argument, too.\n \n As a reminder, let's see the claim Lakrite is trying to support:If a man wants to have sex with a woman, he will more likely do so if he knows the woman can just get an abortion.\n\n \n[continuing later]Add that up and you get roughly 5,338,349 pregnancies in the year 2005, and 4,257,850 pregnancies during the year 1960. This evidence supports the claim that men are more likely to get a woman pregnant if abortion is an option.\n\n This \"evidence\" also says that men are more likely to get a woman pregnant when the calendar year starts with \"20\" than when it starts with \"19.\" (We should rework the calendar to reduce pregnancy! Wow, who'da thunk we could solve an overpopulation issue with a new calendar?)\n The only thing you've shown here are numbers of pregnancies. You have not shown numbers for instances of sexual intercourse to show a correlation. You have not shown any numbers for likelihood of having sex. You also haven't shown how many of these pregnancies were planned, unplanned, and/or unwanted. Even if you did, though, you've forgotten the age-old mantra, \"correlation does not mean causation.\" Your numbers do not constitute evidence. Your claim refers to desire, likelihood, and pregnancy, so you need to establish a relationship between all three.\n \n You said that there are numerous ways to support your claim, but you led with this? This is trash; this is scientifically worthless. This is laughable and pathetic. Can you actually support your claim with one of these \"numerous\" ways?\n \n \nThe man will have no responsibility, as even if \"safer sex\" practices do not work, abortion is always the back-up escape plan.\n\n This is like saying that skydiving with a parachute is irresponsible because the skydiver has a backup 'chute.\n\n Except that backup parachute is intended to save the life of the man. Abortion is intended to end the life of a developing human.\n\n My original objection was based on the soundness of your argument in a philosophical sense, not on the effect. However, I think I might have previously misinterpreted what you meant by \"responsibility,\" but you can let me know by giving some clarification if my new understanding is incorrect.\n If you're using \"responsibility\" as hyperbole for accountability then it seems that you're arguing that an abortion wrongly relieves a man of the accountability of impregnating the woman.\n Let's presume that this interpretation is correct so that I can continue. What if the man pays for an abortion the woman is willing to have? Then he has accepted accountability for his actions. If the woman accepts such an offer, how does that qualify as abuse? Further -- though not to discount the physiological effect of an abortion -- why doesn't the woman bear accountability in the same way? You anti-choicers are always screaming that it takes two to tango, so why do we now hear that the man must be abusing the woman?\n \n \nBut that is simply another strawman argument.\n\n Once again, my (probably now defunct) objection was not based on results but on the wording of the argument itself, which should have been clear from the emphasis I used via font style. You took what I said and ran it in a different direction; if either of us is guilty of the strawman fallacy, it's you.\n \n \nIn places were abortion is illegal most laws aren't followed anyway. <<\n\n Oh, look another positive claim. If it actually had any relevance to the discussion, I'd ask you to provide numbers. I don't think you can, because I think you pulled this idea right out of your bum. I find myself wondering why it is that you associate abortion-prohibiting countries with rampant crime yet still want to make this country abortion-prohibiting.\n \n \nThere will still be people who break the law, but there will be a large number of people who respect it\n\n What the hell does this mean? It means squat. It's irrelevant. Random rambling, stumbling, and bumbling to stall and hope that I can't produce the numbers to support my point. You're in for a rude awakening.\n \n \nShow me your statistics, go ahead.\n\n See below, after I finish responding to your statements.\n \n \nYou also need to show statistics that prove my claim wrong.\n\n No, I don't. I have to show statistics that support my claim. You have to show statistics that support your claim. You haven't. In fact, you said that you could, you said that you could do it multiple ways, and you selected a \"way\" that showed nothing relevant to the conversation. How pathetic.\n \n \n Read the following article regarding a study from the WHO.\n Legal or Not, Abortion Rates Compare\n \n Published: October 12, 2007\n \n ROME, Oct. 11 - A comprehensive global study of abortion has concluded that abortion rates are similar in countries where it is legal and those where it is not, suggesting that outlawing the procedure does little to deter women seeking it.\n \n Moreover, the researchers found that abortion was safe in countries where it was legal, but dangerous in countries where it was outlawed and performed clandestinely. Globally, abortion accounts for 13 percent of women's deaths during pregnancy and childbirth, and there are 31 abortions for every 100 live births, the study said.\n \n The results of the study, a collaboration between scientists from the World Health Organization in Geneva and the Guttmacher Institute in New York, a reproductive rights group, are being published Friday in the journal Lancet.\n \n \"We now have a global picture of induced abortion in the world, covering both countries where it is legal and countries where laws are very restrictive,\" Dr. Paul Van Look, director of the W.H.O. Department of Reproductive Health and Research, said in a telephone interview. \"What we see is that the law does not influence a woman's decision to have an abortion. If there's an unplanned pregnancy, it does not matter if the law is restrictive or liberal.\"\n \n But the legal status of abortion did greatly affect the dangers involved, the researchers said. \"Generally, where abortion is legal it will be provided in a safe manner,\" Dr. Van Look said. \"And the opposite is also true: where it is illegal, it is likely to be unsafe, performed under unsafe conditions by poorly trained providers.\"\n \n The data also suggested that the best way to reduce abortion rates was not to make abortion illegal but to make contraception more widely available, said Sharon Camp, chief executive of the Guttmacher Institute.\n \n In Eastern Europe, where contraceptive choices have broadened since the fall of Communism, the study found that abortion rates have decreased by 50 percent, although they are still relatively high compared with those in Western Europe. \"In the past we didn't have this kind of data to draw on,\" Ms. Camp said. \"Contraception is often the missing element\" where abortion rates are high, she said.\n \n [snip]\n Here are the compiled numbers and conclusions.\n \n \n Follow the link and read the whole thing. Three things become obvious:\n 1. Outlawing abortion does very little -- if anything -- to actually reduce the number of abortions.\n 2. If you want to reduce the number of abortions, educate the citizenry about contraception and make contraception widely available. This means that asinine abstinence-only education needs to end and that sex needs to be un-demonized by the ultra-conservatives so that people aren't ashamed of obtaining contraception and aren't afraid of punishment for possessing it.\n 3. If you want to reduce the number of complications from abortions, those abortions should be legalized procedures performed by standard medical protocol and subject to standard medical oversight.\n \n So when we look at the rightwing nutjobs who say they're trying to save the unborn and the psychological health of mothers, but they protest Roe v. Wade and promote abstinence-only sex ed, they're actually having an effect opposite of their stated desire.\n \n Upon being shown this information, do they change their tactics?\n Well, Lakrite, will you?",

I don't think you can, because I think you pulled this idea right out of your bum. I find myself wondering why it is that you associate abortion-prohibiting countries with rampant crime yet still want to make this country abortion-prohibiting.\n\n A known fact is that the fast majority of all countries that have abortion outlawed are in South America and Africa. Countries in these regions are developing countries, and developing countries tend to have increased poverty and crime rates. The few that do allow abortion still have high crime rates. South Africa has very high crime rates, a known fact. You cannot compare the statistics of a developing country with the United States.\n \n \nOutlawing abortion does very little -- if anything -- to actually reduce the number of abortions.\n\n Outlawing anything does very little in developing countries. However, in more recent years, crime rates have began to decrease in developing countries, but the abortion statistics I was given in the article were from 2003, when developing countries did have higher crime rates.\n \n But even if all of what I said above is totally false, you still cannot compare the abortion rates of developing and developed countries. The economic systems are entirely different. One reason for abortion is poverty, and developing countries have more poverty and would be more willing to break that law and have an abortion.\n \n In order to more fairly compare abortion rates, we must look not at countries in Africa but countries in Europe. This article explains why it makes little sense to say that by making something that had been legal illegal, more people will do that something. Ironically, it disputes the actual source of evidence you cited in your argument. Even if that evidence is completely valid, your own source disproves the point you are trying to make.\n \n Time to compare countries in Europe with more similar economic structures. Let us compare not Africa and the United States, but Ireland (Illegal Abortion) with England and Wales(Legal abortion)\n \nEven if we take the Guttmacher numbers at face value, however, the claim that criminalization does not effect the abortion rate does not bear scrutiny. Abortion in Ireland, for example, is illegal in most cases, whereas across the pond in England and Wales it is basically legal (though with more restrictions than in the U.S.). According to Guttmacher, the abortion rate for Ireland in 1996 was 5.9. For England and Wales, 15.6. That is, by Guttmacher&#8217;s own numbers, the abortion rate for England (where abortion is legal) is several times what it is in Ireland (where it is not). Presumably the lower Irish rate is not due to the country&#8217;s fanatical devotion to sex education and contraception.\n\n \n Actually, upon reading the whole article, it is stating what I was stating at the start of the post. Read the whole article, it touches on the main points that:\n 1. Abortion rates are higher in developing countries whether or not it is illegal or legal.\n 2. Developed countries have lower abortion rates.\n 3. When comparing developed countries with illegal and legal abortion rates, countries with illegal abortion have less abortions than countries with legal abortion.\n \n \n3. If you want to reduce the number of complications from abortions, those abortions should be legalized procedures performed by standard medical protocol and subject to standard medical oversight.\n\n This point is correct, but the problem is that women should not be getting abortions when abortion is illegal. That is their own fault for breaking the law. It reminds me of court cases were burglars sued homeowners for slipping on their sidewalk when trying to break into their house. If people do damage to themselves as a result of breaking a law, that is their own problem.\n \n I have more to say, but I do not have time right now to type anything else or even proofread this post for typos etc. So I will be back later tonight to finish up.",

For example, I could say, \"It's a known fact that brown-eyed people should be exterminated.\" Pretty dumb, huh? Provide some actual evidence.\n \n \nYou cannot compare the statistics of a developing country with the United States.\n\n I most certainly can. The fact that those statistics don't always work out in your favor is just tough beans for you. You conveniently ignored this line, written in plain and simple English for plain and simple people like you:On the other hand, a woman's likelihood of having an abortion is similar whether she lives in a developed or developing region; in 2003, there were 26 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 in developed countries compared with 29 per 1,000 in developing countries.\n\n \nOutlawing anything does very little in developing countries.\n\n Is that so? Then you can show the difference of the effects on outlawing something in a developing country versus outlawing something in a developed country. Or can you?\n \n \nBut even if all of what I said above is totally false,\n\n or irrelevant...\n \n you still cannot compare the abortion rates of developing and developed countries. The economic systems are entirely different. One reason for abortion is poverty, and developing countries have more poverty and would be more willing to break that law and have an abortion.\n\n Now this is interesting. You think that we can ignore the fact that these people who want abortions will get them regardless of the law. You want to gloss over it because you have made an unsubstantiated claim that these people do so because they live in poverty. Thus, I propose a new plan that you can promote: Instead of outlawing abortion, give poor pregnant women who lean toward abortion free money. I know that idea'll catch on like wildfire in rightwingville.\n \n Seriously, you're making so little sense, you're actually making other conservatives look bad; now that's impressive.\n \n \nIn order to more fairly compare abortion rates, we must look not at countries in Africa but countries in Europe. This article explains why it makes little sense to say that by making something that had been legal illegal, more people will do that something.\n\n It makes little sense to argue against a strawman, unless of course you can't argue against the facts.\n You and your blogger buddy have made a humongous, boneheaded mistake. Nowhere do the data -- or the interpretation -- suggest that outlawing abortion increases the rates. The study shows that the rates compare; that is, there is no significant correlation between abortion rates and abortion's legal status.\n Seriously, that's damn near as dumbass a mistake as somebody can make. I mean, you've already made yourself look downright moronic with your inability to understand numbers, but this is comedy gold.\n \n \nEven if that evidence is completely valid, your own source disproves the point you are trying to make.\n\n Only to those who are scientifically illiterate. That'd be you and your buddy.\n \n \nTime to compare countries in Europe with more similar economic structures. Let us compare not Africa and the United States, but Ireland (Illegal Abortion) with England and Wales(Legal abortion).\n\n Cherry picking. Let me help you out once again:Legal restrictions on abortion do not affect its incidence. For example, the abortion rate is 29 in Africa, where abortion is illegal in many circumstances in most countries, and it is 28 in Europe, where abortion is generally permitted on broad grounds. The lowest rates in the world are in Western and Northern Europe, where abortion is accessible with few restrictions.\n\n \nRead the whole article, it touches on the main points that:\n 1. Abortion rates are higher in developing countries whether or not it is illegal or legal.\n\n This is not in dispute; what is in dispute -- among other things -- is how large that disparity is. The numbers show a difference, but certainly a small one.\n \n \n2. Developed countries have lower abortion rates.\n\n Once again, true. Yet, first, the disparity is once again not as large as I suspect you'd like to hope; second, I'm pretty damn sure my reason for citing the article was to contest the rationale behind outlawing abortion.\n \n \n3. When comparing developed countries with illegal and legal abortion rates, countries with illegal abortion have less abortions than countries with legal abortion.\n\n Please provide the specific data you used to draw this conclusion, and explain why your conclusion follows from those data.\n \n \nbut the problem is that women should not be getting abortions when abortion is illegal.\n\n No, the problem is that abortion should not be illegal. Can't you keep up?\n \n \nThat is their own fault for breaking the law. It reminds me of court cases were burglars sued homeowners for slipping on their sidewalk when trying to break into their house. If people do damage to themselves as a result of breaking a law, that is their own problem.\n\n What the hell are you talking about now? Did I miss a memo about a recent rash of formerly pregnant women who have sued their abortion doctors for \"damage\"?\n \n \nI have more to say, but I do not have time right now to type anything else or even proofread this post for typos etc. So I will be back later tonight to finish up.\n\n I hope you read my post first. Any more of your rubbish without realizing your mistakes will just be a waste of time.",

For example, I could say, \"It's a known fact that brown-eyed people should be exterminated.\" Pretty dumb, huh? Provide some actual evidence.\n\n South Africa DOES have high crime rates. That fact is not disputable, just as the fact that the earth has oxygen is not disputable. I do not need to display charts of oxygen levels in the air to prove oxygen is on earth.\n Just because you do not know something that many people know does not make me wrong.\n Here is a site with many crime rate statistics looked at, specifically South Africa.\n South Africa's Position in Africa's Crime Rankings - African Security Review Vol 9 No 4, 2000\n \n \nI most certainly can. The fact that those statistics don't always work out in your favor is just tough beans for you. You conveniently ignored this line, written in plain and simple English for plain and simple people like you:\n\n Remember when you said you cannot simply \"think\" about something? Well you cannot just show evidence and not analyze it either. Although a wikipedia article, the following\n does help explain characteristics and locations of developing vs. developed countries.\n Developing country - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Now you must understand that developing countries have totally different social, political, and economic structures than developed countries. It would be more accurate to compare the United States to Europe than to compare the United States to Africa.\n It is fallacious to say the failure of something in Africa will result in failure in the United States, especially considered how Ireland (pretty much the only illegal abortion country in Europe besides Poland, which also has similar results)has succeded in reducing abortions while abortion is outlawed.\n \nOn the other hand, a woman's likelihood of having an abortion is similar whether she lives in a developed or developing region; in 2003, there were 26 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 in developed countries compared with 29 per 1,000 in developing countries.\n\n I didn't ignore it...and I don't ever recall saying that abortion rates in developing countries and developed countries are not similar. They are similar, but not equal. What I said:\n \nAbortion rates are higher in developing countries whether or not it is illegal or legal\n\n Is true, as shown by your and my evidence. My main point is that you cannot justify the effects of outlawing abortion in the US by citing comparisons in Africa.\n \nWhat we see is that the law does not influence a woman's decision to have an abortion. If there's an unplanned pregnancy, it does not matter if the law is restrictive or liberal.\"\n\n This conclusion is invalid. It assumes that:\n 1. Outlawing abortion in Africa and other developing countries has little effect on the number of abortions in Africa. False In order to assume this you must have the number of abortions that took place in Africa while abortion was legal. It is logical to say that if abortion were made legal in developing countries, more people would have them.\n 2. Therefore if abortion were illegal in the United States the abortion rate would be about the same as it is now. Once again, incorrect. You must compare the amount of abortions during a time period in which abortion was legal and one in which abortion was illegal IN THE SAME COUNTRY.\n \n The argument made is essentially this:\n \n 1. Abortion is illegal in most developing countries\n 2. Abortion is legal in most developed countries.\n 2. The abortion rate of developing and developed countries is similar.\n 3. Therefore, the legality of abortion in developing and developed countries not affect the number of abortions that take place.\n Just because the legality of abortion seems to have no affect on Africa does not mean it will not have an affect on other countries. This logic is very similar to the fallacy of composition.\n \n So to judge the likelihood of illegal abortion creating less abortion rates in the United States, we must now turn to comparing data within the United States.\n \n But how does one find illegal abortion rates? They are illegal, and thus they will not be reported. In a murder or rape, somebody reports them, so those rates do exist. But nobody would report or even find out about an illegal abortion. To get an idea, we can look at women dying from illegal abortions, but then again we could not use that data as we do not know how many abortions a woman would have before she died.\n This article explains in detail the problems with finding illegal abortion statistics.\n \nOne study quoted in the U.S. Senate debate was authored by Dr. T. Hilgers from Creighton University, who estimated the figure probably was at or somewhere near 100,000 abortions annually in the U.S. prior to legalization.\n\n This site shows numerous abortions statistics.\n In 1960 there were 292 legal abortions, with roughly 100,000 illegal abortions, coming out to 100,292 total. That is compared to 1,206,000 abortions today. There are 12 times the amount of abortions today now that abortion is illegal than in a time when it was illegal. Even if I said that there were 1,000,000 abortions occurring illegally in 1960, there would still be 206,000 more abortions today. That is a 20% increase in the number of abortions, which, despite the fact that the numbers 1 million and 1.2 million are similar in size, is not insignificant at all. \n \n It is impossible to give actual illegal abortion rates during the 1960s because of the fact that they of course would not be recorded. The estimated number of illegal abortions is the only data to go off of.",

You've shown precisely nothing.\n \nSouth Africa DOES have high crime rates. That fact is not disputable, just as the fact that the earth has oxygen is not disputable.\n\n You missed my point entirely. Your post was laced with phrases like \"known fact\" as if that's a freebie. The statement can be challenged, so when someone asks you for data, you'd better provide them.\n \n \nI do not need to display charts of oxygen levels in the air to prove oxygen is on earth.\n\n If someone challenged you to provide evidence that there is oxygen on the earth, you could provide said evidence in a number of ways. A chart is not a necessary component. Citations and experiments work equally well.\n \n \nJust because you do not know something that many people know does not make me wrong.\n\n The irony here is that you get all pissy when I point out that you'd better have data when you're challenged, so you provide data for this claim that I didn't actually dispute (why would I? I've argued and still maintain that it's irrelevant), yet you continue to take the conversation farther and farther away from the original challenges I made to you.\n \n \nNow you must understand that developing countries have totally different social, political, and economic structures than developed countries. It would be more accurate to compare the United States to Europe than to compare the United States to Africa.\n\n Look, I posted the quotation right in my post for you to read. The numbers do compare. Have I -- or has anyone -- tried to argue that legislation is the only factor at work? Absolutely not; not even you would come out and make that accusation. Instead, you just imply it.\n \n \nIt is fallacious to say the failure of something in Africa will result in failure in the United States, especially considered how Ireland (pretty much the only illegal abortion country in Europe besides Poland, which also has similar results)has succeded in reducing abortions while abortion is outlawed.\n\n What's wrong, Lakrite? You don't know what cherry picking is? You're pointing at one example and raising it above the rest without justification. That, Lakrite, is so fallacious that it has its own name.\n \n But, hey, if you demand to compare the abortion rate of North America (defined by this study as the U.S. and Canada) to those of Europe instead of to those of Africa, we could do that:\n 2003 abortion rate in North America: 21\n 2003 abortion rate in Europe: 28\n Is North America's abortion rate lower because North America has outlawed abortion? Considering North America hasn't outlawed abortion, I'm pretty damn sure the answer is no.\n \n Some interpretation:The most dramatic decline in abortion incidence occurred in Eastern Europe, a region where abortion is, for the most part, legal and safe: the rate fell from 90 to 44.\n\n \nThe lowest rates in the world are in Western and Northern Europe, where abortion is accessible with few restrictions.\nThe study makes it clear over and over again: The legal status of abortion is a lousy predictor of abortion rate. A factor with a larger impact on abortion rate is availability of contraception (including knowledge of its proper use).\n What the anti-choicers are doing is akin to trying to move a pile of sand by throwing one grain at a time up in the air -- such that it might be moved away by wind, but might not -- while refusing to use a shovel and a wheelbarrow.\n \n \nMy main point is that you cannot justify the effects of outlawing abortion in the US by citing comparisons in Africa.\n\n Even if we suppose that your main point is correct, that's not what I'm doing. I'm citing worldwide evidence. You're pretending that I'm cherry-picking.\n You insisted that we compare using Europe instead of Africa, so I did, and it didn't help you.\n \n \nThis conclusion is invalid. It assumes that:\n 1. Outlawing abortion in Africa and other developing countries has little effect on the number of abortions in Africa. False In order to assume this you must have the number of abortions that took place in Africa while abortion was legal.\n\n No, those numbers are not required. We have data for countries where abortion is legal and where it is not. It is a valid contrast.\n \n \nIt is logical to say that if abortion were made legal in developing countries, more people would have them.\n\n Only if you can provide evidence for such.\n \n \n2. Therefore if abortion were illegal in the United States the abortion rate would be about the same as it is now. Once again, incorrect. You must compare the amount of abortions during a time period in which abortion was legal and one in which abortion was illegal IN THE SAME COUNTRY.\n\n 1. This is not a lab experiment. We can't manipulate the system and take measurements before and after as if trying to burn a match in an anaerobic atmosphere and then trying with oxygen present. In non-lab examples such as this one, we take large sample sizes and use the law of large numbers to increase the reliability of the data. This is simple statistics.\n 2. There is fluctuation of abortion rates within single countries when abortion's legality is not changing. A huge one is the availability of contraception.\n 3. Finally, and most importantly: You call this italicized statement a required assumption, but it is nothing of the sort. In fact, the argument here is that the legal status has minimal impact on the abortion rate; thus, the \"assumption\" you've created is antithetical to the position.\n \n \nThe argument made is essentially this:\n \n 1. Abortion is illegal in most developing countries\n 2. Abortion is legal in most developed countries.\n 2. The abortion rate of developing and developed countries is similar.\n 3. Therefore, the legality of abortion in developing and developed countries not affect the number of abortions that take place.\n\n Ignoring your apparent inability to count... your argument is a strawman. Statement 3 is not the argument, nor is it the basis for the argument. The low abortion rate in Western and Northern Europe -- definitely not developing countries -- deals a serious blow to your arguments.\n \n \nJust because the legality of abortion seems to have no affect on Africa does not mean it will not have an affect on other countries. This logic is very similar to the fallacy of composition.\n\n Please try to pay attention, Lakrite: You can try all the special pleading and cherry picking your little heart desires, but Europe's numbers show that your overall conclusion is wrong.\n \n \nTo get an idea, we can look at women dying from illegal abortions, but then again we could not use that data as we do not know how many abortions a woman would have before she died.\n\n So you're saying that we could be counting a woman only once when she might represent multiple abortions, meaning that we've establish minimum values? So rates in countries that outlaw abortions might be even higher than thought? (I'm actually guessing not, because I presume the statistics used in the report used some model to account for this, but I don't know that methodology. I just thought it would be humorous to readers to show Lakrite the consequence of the rationale for his objection.)\n \n \nIn 1960 there were 292 legal abortions, with roughly 100,000 illegal abortions, coming out to 100,292 total.\n\n Thank you for proving your statistical ignorance. High school science teaches about significant figures, which should have instilled in you the understanding that 292 plus around 100,000 does not mean 100,292. It means around 100,000.\n Evidence for statistical ignorance, part II: You're comparing absolute data instead of comparing rates. Shame on you. \n Evidence for statistical ignorance, part III: You missed the part where the numbers represented by your source do not represent all states. Even through the 70s, not all states' abortion statistics are available, meaning the real numbers are higher.\n \n \nThat is compared to 1,206,000 abortions today. There are 12 times the amount of abortions today now that abortion is illegal than in a time when it was illegal.\n\n And there are only about two-thirds as many abortions (rate-wise -- after all, that's the honest way to compare) today than nearly thirty years ago, when abortion was also legal.\n Considering the rate was going up before Roe and continued going up well after Roe, then declined, it's clear that there are factors other than legality. You're champing at the bit to refer to developing vs. developed, and you insist that we must compare time when legal vs. time when illegal, but you want to ignore the other effects of that time change, such as actual birth and abortion rates (as evidenced by your citing absolute data), availability of abortion, safety of abortion, stigma of abortion, availability of contraception and comprehensive sex education, etc.\n \n \nIt is impossible to give actual illegal abortion rates during the 1960s because of the fact that they of course would not be recorded. The estimated number of illegal abortions is the only data to go off of.\n\n By the way, I didn't see where you got the 100,000 number. Where was this from? Did it include the states that didn't report any numbers at all? How large would this number be if it represented the entire country? To what abortion rate does that correspond?",

It's not even a phenomenon restricted to the U.S. As these \"family planning\" options became understood, safe, and affordable, the demand for them increased, irrespective of law.\n\n \n Along with the availability of contraception, came the denial that an abortion kills a child. That having an abortion was tantamount to murder or manslaughter, etc.\n \n Much of that denial was due to the Courts ignorance on things like genetics, the science regarding aging and \"when a person's life begins\", etc.\n \n So, YES,.. the demand for elective abortion grew as a result of the ignorance and denials of the court. (Specifically the Supreme Court)\n \n There is a cause and affect relationship between the finding and conclusions of our courts and the tolerances of society as reflected in our laws.\n \n That being said,.. were the courts to overturn Roe v. Wade, recognize the scientific evidence regarding genetics, aging, etc... and establish the fact that an abortion kills a child and that it is tantamount to \"murder\" or manslaughter,... The laws and tolerances reflected in our society would be likewise reflected.\n \n This is different from prohibitions like banning booze, because there is no recreational value in having an abortion. And an abortion, unlike having a beer is not a \"victimless\" crime.\n \n To suggest that the demand for abortion would INCREASE as a result of banning it is therefor unsubstantiated.\n \n \n To claim that I've argued that the numbers will increase as a result of elective abortion being banned is not only not supported by the historical facts, it's a big fat lie. Your insinuation is awfully dishonest. Why do you have to build a strawman to attack? Is it because you can't counter my actual argument?\n\n \n I was responding to Lakrite's post, not yours. If you do not believe that the demand for abortion will increase as a result of it being banned,... all you had to do is say so. \n \n It seems as though you agree that the demand will not increase as a result of abortion being recriminalized.

   "Ok electrolyte. Now please, actually answer the question.\nWhat is the logic behind the idea that outlawing abortion will not reduce the number of abortions?\n\n\n There is no need to \"answer\" this question. It's the fallacy of the complex question. First, my argument is not that there is some logic that -- taken alone -- makes it reasonable to accept my point. The data support my point.\n Second, whether or not there is \"logic\" behind the observed phenomenon is irrelevant. We already have the observed phenomenon. What you're asking for is like asking for an explanation of gravity before you'll accept the plethora of evidence that an egg released from four feet above the ground will travel toward the center of the earth.\n \n \nYour \"evidence\" can be caused by a number of factors.\n\n I never denied that there are multiple factors at work. In fact, I explicitly said as much. But the bottom line is that when you tried to apply your interpretation to argue that we should compare North America to Europe instead of Africa, I showed that your viewpoint is still not supported.\n \n \nYou now need to explain why the legality of abortion does not affect the number of abortions. Evidence is nothing without analysis.\n\n Okay, I'll use your analysis. You lose.\n \n \nThe problem seems to me (especially considering the bulk of your last post was full of personal attacks and yet another strawman argument) that you have no logical explanation.\n\n The only reason the problem seems to you to be anything besides your lack of support is the fact that [i]you[i]'re the one making the losing argument. I clearly provided an analysis of the data that supported my conclusion, including a rebuttal to your invalid argument. You then decided to change horses midstream.\n \n \nHmm...thats hypocritical of you. You did the exact same thing only minutes ago.\n\n How does my previous response to you construct a strawman? You asked for \"logic,\" which is an asinine request considering that we have the data. I explained that there is no need to provide a logical prediction of data when those data are already available. What is so hard to understand about this?\n If what you're really looking for (but can't express it well) is an interpretation of the data, I don't even have to do that. Using your own interpretation, your argument still fails miserably.",

What else would you call it?\n \n \nThis is an arena for the battle of ideas. I'm encouraging all those who are willing to investigate for themselves; the things I claim.\n\n But I have, and I still challenge you.

Genetics and other observations so far seem to support that determination. \n\n Perhaps you're used to railroading people who don't have a good understanding of science. I want to discuss the science. I don't want a formal debate, where the objectives of learning and teaching unfortunately become secondary to convincing the judges who is correct.\n Specifically, I challenge your logic: First, we can define \"aging\" in a number of ways. For example, we can determine the \"age\" of a rock via a (and I'm taking some descriptive liberties here) chemical clock, but we don't call that rock alive. Alternatively, we can look at \"aging\" as a result of telomeric shortening, which will begin as soon as mitosis starts. Why does this necessitate the attribute of \"life\"?\n \n \nBeing that I read the 5th and 14th Amendments as pertaining to the \"biological aspects of \"personhood\" <<\n\n Once again, what the hell do you mean by \"biological aspects of personhood\"? You've shown no actual connection (and certainly not a scientific one) between \"aging\" and \"personhood.\" Your argument amounts to, \"because A has B, I conclude C.\"\n \n \nYou can't prove a negative (that a pre-birth child is not a person) but have fun with your attempts.\n\n Ugh. And you say you have a background in logic. What poppycock.\n You're thinking of the impossibility of proving a universal negative. Proving negatives happens all the time. If you want me to show you, thus making you look like a complete imbecile, I'll be happy to. For this post, I'll instead simply point out that your assertion, \"you can't prove a negative,\" which you have presented as fact, is itself a negative.\n But that's really not even the issue. It's not my job to prove a negative. He who has the positive claim has the burden of proof. If I want to argue that an embryo does not qualify as alive, that burden of proof is upon me. If you want to argue that embryos have life, or personhood, or rights, then the burden of proof is upon you.\n \n \nHowever, you should be aware that every fact that proves they are individual human beings (persons) severely undermines your efforts.\n\n See, this is the BS I'm sick of dealing with. I repeatedly challenge your \"scientifically\" based conclusions, but all you do is repeat the claim and say that it's a fact. You should be aware that such a statement is meaningless unless you can draw a necessary correlation between these facts and the idea that embryos are legally \"persons.\"",

I know they have been justified and I don't need your acceptance to know it to be so. If anything, your outrage and personal attacks re-affirm my conclusions even better than any reluctant tacit acknowledgment ever would.\n \n \n You say that you disagree with the conclusions? That's fine with me.\n\n \n \n I do. \"Therefore, zygotes are persons\" is not a logical conclusion of \"aging begins at conception.\" The whole point here is that I do object. You just got through saying that this is a forum for discussion of viewpoints, and now you're saying that you're not interested in pursuing that discussion?\n\n \n When scientists determine that a person's aging process begins at their conception, they are (whether they like it or not) adding justification to the claim that a person's life begins at conception. AND to the claim that \"personhood\" begins at conception as well. \n \n \nWhat you set as your threshold for \"necessary correlation\" is not a template for everyone else to follow. Nor is my threshold at template for others, for that matter.\n\n \n \nI noticed. Plenty of people are just like you in that they see some information and decide that it confirms what they believe. You repeatedly brought up genetics and biology and how they allegedly support your point, so I told you that I wanted to talk about them in detail. Strangely enough, you've balked repeatedly at the offer.\n\n \n You have been wasting a lot of time talking about talking,... when you could have been asking questions which get to the specifics of the points you are trying so desperately to make. (that's why it's so tiresome)\n \n \n Your personal attacks on myself, my logic, etc. are fast growing tiresome. If you have a position that you feel is better supported by the facts. A position that is complete with your \"necessary correlation?\" Let's hear it. Hopefully you will be better at answering questions about the specifics of that position than you have been about forming questions about my own.\n\n \n \n 1. You opened the door when you referred to your \"background in logic.\" You proceeded to make a statement that you thought was a tenet of logic but was actually not, so I called you on it. You don't get to complain for being exposed as illogical.\n\n \n No matter how desperate you are to make it so,.. an attack on or the questioning of someones logic is not quite the same thing as refuting it.\n \n Try again.\n \n \n 2. Your continual reference to \"biological facts\" that you pretend actually support your point is tiresome, too. I keep calling you on it, and you keep pretending that it's not an issue. Given the opportunity to discuss the both the scientific findings and the conclusions that might be drawn from them scientifically (versus philosophically) with somebody who is qualified to do so, you're running away.\n\n \n I accepted your challenge to debate the specifics of the issue and it was YOU who ran from the debate challenge. Not I. (and for a pretty lame reason, I might add) \"I don't want a formal debate, where the objectives of learning and teaching unfortunately become secondary to convincing the judges who is correct.\" A total insult to the builders of this site who (I'm confident) has every intention of keeping formal debates genuinely directed towards a significantly meaningful conclusion and not just a \"gold star of the day\" recognition for the one who made the best attempt at a presentation.\n \n \n 3. My previous post addressed a number of points -- some of which you introduced -- including interpretation of the Constitution, personal rights, and bait-and-switch terminology, but you elected to respond to none of them.\n\n \n Yeah,... I'm saving some of that for a more formal debate. \n \n Until then!",

You cannot just throw out numbers and just make a claim without making an analysis. \n \n Let me teach you how to actually make an argument.\n \n Thesis (The legality of abortion has no effect on the number of abortions.)\n Which is supported by:\n Claims (Why the thesis is true)\n because of:\n Warrants (Why the evidence supports the claims)\n Finally all supported by\n Evidence (Developed countries and developing countries have similar abortion rates)\n \n You skipped the claims and warrants and created a thesis with no thoughts.

But wait...a theory is essentially claims and warrants.\n \n All you have to tell me is why the legality of abortion has no effect. If you have a thoughtful argument it should be no challenge to you. As you can see, your argument is quite empty without analysis.\n \n Why is it that the legality of abortion has no effect on the number of abortions? Abortion rates are similar, but legality is not the only variable in play. (ie: contraceptives, etc.) You are wrongly assuming that legality is the only variable. It isn't. You must therefore explain why legality has no effect. Abortion rates may be higher or lower for a number of reasons. I state legality is one of them and gave my reasons why above. I gave evidence. You have stated legality is not one of those variables. Yet you have no reasons, and your evidence is not strong at all. Answer the question.",

That would be the same as saying contraception has no effect.\n One can say that the number of abortions will increase without contraception because more people will become pregnant. Therefore, contraception has an effect. Outlawing abortion will cause the availability of abortion to decrease. Therefore, it too has an effect on the number of abortions. If country A has something that decreases the number of abortions (contraception) and something that increases the number of abortions (legal abortion) are present at the same time, and Country B has something that decreases the number of abortions (illegal abortion) and increases the number of abortions (illegal contraception) at the same time, the two countries should have relatively similar abortion rates. And they do. The why is important. If you, as a science teacher, cannot understand that, then you should not be teaching science.\n \nI've stated that legality is not an impactful variable.\n\n Thats exactly what I said you stated. You aren't reading everything I am saying.\n \nAbortion rates may be higher or lower for a number of reasons. I state legality is one of them and gave my reasons why above. I gave evidence. You have stated legality is not one of those variables.\n\n \"one of those\"=variables that do effect abortion rates, as clear from my paragraph in context.\n \nI never said that it was the only variable in play. In fact, I explicitly mentioned, multiple times, that it's not the only variable.\n\n If that is true, then you DO have to explain why it is that legality is not one of the many variables that effect abortion rates. The evidence you showed may be caused by a number of variables, so now tell me why legality is not one of them.\n \nAnother lie.\n\n You still haven't. You can't be that ambiguous. You must literally say that A=this and B=this. You have to define the variables first.\n \n \nI agree! But simple logic appears to be too complex for you. You don't understand parody as a method of logical refutation.\n\n So you are willing to admit that there is no logical reasoning behind your argument? \n \n I see no reason to continue showing particular patience with people who won't answer questions. \n\n Oh the irony! emoticon_rolleyes I spy a hypocrite! You then must be impatient with yourself, for you have yet to answer my question.\n \n Why would the legality of abortion have no effect on the number of abortions? All common sense says it does. Think about it. Yes, think. I hate to tell you that people actually need to think.\n Abortion is legal:\n 1). People have access to it almost anywhere.\n 2). It is safe; more people will take the risk.\n 3). There is no legal punishment.\n \n Abortion is illegal:\n 1). Access is limited to illegal \"undercover\" operations.\n 2). It is dangerous; less people will take the risk.\n 3). There is legal punishment if caught.\n \n You cannot honestly tell me that you think abortion rates would be the same. It defies logic completely. Tell me why your evidence applies to your thesis.\n Why would the legality of abortion have no effect on the number of abortions? Like you, I have little patience with people who can't answer a question.",

Otherwise he would argue in favor of infanticide since obviously mother knows best.

   "Actually I made no value judgements at all. \n\n So then explain to me what on earth it is you are thinking.\n The only difference between a baby born premature after 6 months and an unborn baby at 6 months is the location of the baby. One is in the womb, the other is not. If a baby of the same age can be killed in a womb, but not outside of it, you are putting more value on the born baby. You actually are making a value judgement. You need to explain why a baby can be killed inside the womb if another baby totally equal in all respects cannot be killed outside of the womb. Ownership seems to be the only possible reasoning, which would make the fetus property, thus devaluing it. Please clarify your position if it is not inline with what I am stating. Don't be circuitous, simply state your position clearly.\n \nTo deny a person complete autonomy in regards to their body is a limitation of freedom.\n\n I can say the same exact thing about a fetus...and by the way, a fetus is NOT part of the woman's body. It has a separate brain, separate organs...nobody would say that a mother has two separate hearts while pregnant; the baby has one, she has the other. A baby growing inside of a mother often does not even have the same blood type. People cannot have more than one blood type. So explain to me how a fetus is part of the mother's body. Furthermore, the fetus is not even of the same DNA. It has DNA of the father and mother. It is not at all a part of the mother's body. The fetus is simply living inside of the mother.\n \nPlease. Its not like I picked up my womb at the Wal-Mart.\n\n I didn't buy my house at wall-mart either. People do not have to buy what they own. \n \nDecisions regarding my life and health will be mine and mine alone.\n\n Of course! But the problem lies in the fact that a fetus is a separate life, as demonstrated by its unique DNA and blood type.\n \nNot up for discussion. Ever. I will not negotiate that. Period. \n\n That is the attitude of a close-minded person. You have to be open to knowledge and ideas. I have been convinced against my own positions before because I allowed an open mind. \n Close-minded people often ignore key facts and points and deny logic rather than try to understand it.\n \nNow that said - abortion is horrible and I am keenly interested in how that can be fixed. But you are not.\n\n Perfect example of the denial of logic. You say abortion is horrible, and you also say that it kills. You don't know how to fix it, and claim that I am not trying to. The logical thing to do to lessen the number of abortions would be to outlaw it. You deny that as a solution by bringing up the \"woman's body\" argument when it has continually been disproved. Outlawing abortion will be effective, as evidence shows in the only developed countries with outlawed abortion. \n \nYou, like most people on both sides of this issue, are more interested in the argument than the issue.\n\n Not a very sensible post. The issue is abortion and the life of the child. Obviously, if people argue for or against abortion they care about the issue.\n \nIt really isn't rocket science to figure out that villifying and disempowering women are hardly effective ways to fix anything - - at all.\n\n Enough with that argument already! I suppose that all pro-life women want to disempower themselves? That argument has been disproved countless times. But just to reinforce its invalidity, let me sum up why it is ridiculous to say abortion disempowers women.\n 1. Disempowering anyone to perform the act of killing is not a bad thing. Abortion empowers women and allows them to kill the developing child within them. The right to kill the innocent is not a power anyone should have.\n 2. Abortion disempowers men. There are several cases in which men want the child. Why is the woman the sole decider in what happens to the child? Often the argument is \"woman's body\" but the child is NOT the woman's body. If somebody is in my house, that person does not become my house...\n \n Would you like to state why abortion disempowers women? What rights does it actually take away from them? Control over their body? I think not; a woman's body cannot have two blood types or two unique DNA's...\n \n \n The ISSUE is the right to life of a child, born or unborn.\n The Pro-Choice side makes the issue about the rights of the woman.\n Pro-Life advocates understand the \"woman's body\" and \"disempowerment\" talking points, but most Pro-Choicers wont even argue against the right to life, and ignore the issue of the Pro-Life side.",

It is simply because we are a nation which values life and is dedicated in every other instance to preserving and protecting it. Only do the voiceless unborn have no equal protection against being murdered and denied life for committing no wrong at all. \n \n In fact, they are allowed to be killed by the very person who precipitated the alleged problem of their conception. That is neither Just nor an equitable sollution for the inconvenience of taking personal responsibility for the situation the participants caused for a few hours of physical pleasure. Or in your case, a few seconds. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n So to be specific in my answer to you, we're not asking the nanny state to deny women any rights, we're asking the Government to protect the innocent unborn from the mass infanticide which kills approximately 1.3 MILLION UNBORN BABIES PER YEAR IN AMERICA ALONE.\n \n \nDoes it stem from a fear of women, or a hatred of them?\n\n \n Actually, you soulless mysoginist, It is for love and respect for women that we feel as we do. Have you forgotten that fully half of the murdered unborn are women? And that the side affects from abortions which you so easilly ignore are very real and damaging to the spiritual and emotional security of the women who fall victim to this culturally encouraged and accepted form of genocide? \n \n \nBTW, Archie, your header says it all.

It's not fair to equate any of us to the S.0.B. that attacked you on any level. Some of us (speaking for myself mainly) have put and kept women on pedestals our whole life. When my friends would want to go to t-itty bars for bachelor parties (even my own) I opted out... because I've always felt that those women were being taken advantage of, degraded etc. Then I had the chance once to try to talk some out of the profession. \n \n THAT was quite a learning experience!\n \n Still I revere women. Still I revere THOSE women. Including those who have had abortions. \n \n I seek those to point out to my daughter; who is and who is not a good role model for her as a woman,... and I try to explain to her why they are good role models.\n \n You don't know how much ANY of us have in the way of respect for women, Jitobear.\n \n We can't undo the terrible things that happened to you. But I guarantee every decent guy you ever gave the ability to... would rather see that S.0.B. dead than to see him hurt another the way he hurt you.\n \n But where I draw the line (speaking only for myself here) is this; I will not sit quietly by and let someone use the unfortunate set of circumstances in something like a rape,... to justify the denials of the personhood and basic human rights to a child which was created NOT by a rape but by a consentual act of the (would be) mother.\n \n Children have a right to their life and they have a right to their life from the moment it begins. Not just from the moment that you or others like you can't stomache or justify the denial anymore. And you, I or no-one else can deny a child's life or rights except by due process.\n \n There IS (religiously supported or not) a Constitutional justification for allowing an abortion in cases of rape. \n \n Why that isn't enough to appease your concerns on this issue is certainly frustrating.

Don't be circuitous, simply state your position clearly.\n\n \n I don't know. Maybe it is a kind of value judgement - but not between the babies. Each person deserves autonomy, freedom and personal rights. Pregnancy is a unique situation where two individuals are involved. If those two individuals needs are in conflict and only the rights of one can be supported - I believe that the fetus loses. The mother's rights supercede the fetus' - every time.\n \n \nI can say the same exact thing about a fetus...and by the way, a fetus is NOT part of the woman's body. It has a separate brain, separate organs...nobody would say that a mother has two separate hearts while pregnant; the baby has one, she has the other. A baby growing inside of a mother often does not even have the same blood type. People cannot have more than one blood type. So explain to me how a fetus is part of the mother's body. Furthermore, the fetus is not even of the same DNA. It has DNA of the father and mother. It is not at all a part of the mother's body. The fetus is simply living inside of the mother.\n\n \n I don't disagree with any of this but quit trivializing pregnancy. It impacts the health of the mother, drawing nourishment from her, changing her moods. The physical and emotional impacts of pregnancy are huge. It is not a benign relationship.\n \n \nThat is the attitude of a close-minded person. You have to be open to knowledge and ideas. I have been convinced against my own positions before because I allowed an open mind. \n Close-minded people often ignore key facts and points and deny logic rather than try to understand it.\n\n \n Having complete and total control of my body is non-negotiable.\n \n \nPerfect example of the denial of logic. You say abortion is horrible, and you also say that it kills. You don't know how to fix it, and claim that I am not trying to. \n\n \n Actually, I have a LOT of ideas. They have to do with education, health care, mentorship, addressing needs, and birth control.\n \n \nThe logical thing to do to lessen the number of abortions would be to outlaw it. You deny that as a solution by bringing up the \"woman's body\" argument when it has continually been disproved. Outlawing abortion will be effective, as evidence shows in the only developed countries with outlawed abortion. \n\n \n Actually you need to research that better. Half the world's abortions are unsafe or illegal abortions. The lowest incidences of abortion in the world are in developed nations, where there is access to health care, there are resources for expecting mothers and abortion is safe and legal. This information comes from the Guttmacher Institute. They are women's health organization that works with the WHO. They are frequently used by both pro-life and pro-choice organization for their information.\n \n There are ways to prevent unplanned pregnancy. Education and empowerment of women and girls is critical. Even in developed nations girls get the message that a woman without a man is a failure. Who wants to be a failure? Where do you think that will lead? Girls who are poor are at particular risk. They need mentorship. They need opportunity. \n \n Also - there are reasons women seek abortion. Addressing those reasons would also be a good start. Trivializing the realities of their life as \"selfish\" and removing their ability to make their own choices will not help.\n \n I got pregnant during college due to a birth control issue (slipped between when I was changing method). I was living in New Mexico at the time. I was a) worried about finishing my degree, b) I was told I could not get health care (I did not have insurance).\n \n Now someone could have come along and called me selfish, beat me over the head with a bible and showed me pictures of aborted fetuses OR my professors could have worked with me to ensure I was able to complete school and a clever and a non-judgemental woman at the state could have figured out to get me access to medical care. I will give you ONE GUESS as to which solution made it possible for me to have my baby. \n \n Now I am old broad, who doesn't date (or screw), is safe and has her tubes tied. That said, if I were to get pregnant today and that pregnancy were a) a serious threat to my HEALTH (not just my life), b) a serious threat to my livlihood or c) the result of rape - it will be ended. Laws be damned - it will be ended. \n \n Most women have their line in the sand. Now you can work with them, or rail against them and tie the hands of doctors which threatens women's access to complete and effective health care.\n \n \nNot a very sensible post. The issue is abortion and the life of the child. Obviously, if people argue for or against abortion they care about the issue.\n\n \n Then why continue with these ineffective methods? Criminalization will just make abortion unsafe and give lifers a reason to pat themselves on the back, nor will you win hearts and minds with villification and trivialization.\n \n \nEnough with that argument already! I suppose that all pro-life women want to disempower themselves? \n\n \n They can be. Many women are misogynistic. My father's mother comes to mind.\n \n \nAbortion disempowers men. There are several cases in which men want the child. Why is the woman the sole decider in what happens to the child? Often the argument is \"woman's body\" but the child is NOT the woman's body. If somebody is in my house, that person does not become my house...\n\n \n But it does not mean they can stay when you want them to go. And although this situation sucks it is greatly over-shadowed by the number of women seeking abortion with either the support of the father or who are all alone.\n \n \nWould you like to state why abortion disempowers women? What rights does it actually take away from them? Control over their body? \n\n \n Yep.\n \n \nI think not; a woman's body cannot have two blood types or two unique DNA's...\n\n \n Don't be daft. Forcing a woman through a pregnancy against her will is controlling HER body.\n \n \nThe ISSUE is the right to life of a child, born or unborn.\n The Pro-Choice side makes the issue about the rights of the woman.\n Pro-Life advocates understand the \"woman's body\" and \"disempowerment\" talking points, but most Pro-Choicers wont even argue against the right to life, and ignore the issue of the Pro-Life side.\n\n \n I get that. I just don't believe that the fetus' right to be born supercedes the rights of woman to have complete and total autonomy of their body.",

You are essentially arguing that because the mother is in an unfortunate situation she has the right to kill her child to make that situation go away. The mother will not DIE during childbirth. You are not choosing between the life of the fetus and the life of the mother. In the case of a pregnancy where the mother would die, of course she can choose her own life because death to either the mother or her child would be certain.\n \n \n \n \nI don't disagree with any of this but quit trivializing pregnancy. It impacts the health of the mother, drawing nourishment from her, changing her moods. The physical and emotional impacts of pregnancy are huge. It is not a benign relationship.\n\n The effect of an abortion on the mother's growing child is far worse than mood swings and any emotional impacts. And think about this. A newborn baby ALSO puts emotional and physical stress on a woman. Crying all night long? Tiring the woman out? Changing diapers? That would surely be stressful. Hyper children running around the house would be physically and emotionally tiring for women. Why do the rights of the woman to kill the child not continue throughout the child's life? Pregnancy is not at all the only time in life where women experience physical or emotional stress. Whether it be the woman's child or her boss at work, just because she is stressed does not mean she can kill that boss or child.\n \n \n \n \nHaving complete and total control of my body is non-negotiable.\n\n Thats fine.

This information comes from the Guttmacher Institute. They are women's health organization that works with the WHO. They are frequently used by both pro-life and pro-choice organization for their information.\n\n I have already gone into depth about the inaccuracy of stating that legality has no effect. Reread earlier posts. It is not accurate at all to compare developing countries with developed countries and then determine that because something doesn't seem to work in a developing country it wont work in a developed one. Ireland has one of the lowest abortion rates out of all the developing countries...and guess what? It has illegal abortion. It is also pretty much the only developed country with illegal abortion throughout.\n \n \nThere are ways to prevent unplanned pregnancy. Education and empowerment of women and girls is critical. Even in developed nations girls get the message that a woman without a man is a failure. Who wants to be a failure? Where do you think that will lead? Girls who are poor are at particular risk. They need mentorship. They need opportunity. \n\n Of course. This should be done. But it does not justify at all the right to kill a fetus ever.\n \n \nAlso - there are reasons women seek abortion. Addressing those reasons would also be a good start. Trivializing the realities of their life as \"selfish\" and removing their ability to make their own choices will not help.\n\n Of course there are reasons. But the reasons do not matter. Whether the woman is afraid, has a bad family relationship, is worried her education will be hurt, her career, her parents, her own social life...all of that really isn't what matters most which is human life. The life being lost here is the life of the fetus.\n \n \nI got pregnant during college due to a birth control issue (slipped between when I was changing method). I was living in New Mexico at the time. I was a) worried about finishing my degree, b) I was told I could not get health care (I did not have insurance).\n \n Now someone could have come along and called me selfish, beat me over the head with a bible and showed me pictures of aborted fetuses OR my professors could have worked with me to ensure I was able to complete school and a clever and a non-judgemental woman at the state could have figured out to get me access to medical care. I will give you ONE GUESS as to which solution made it possible for me to have my baby. \n\n You do realize that institutes that help women cope with pregnancy are quite often pro-life? Nobody is advocating that the best solution to helping a woman get through her pregnancy is condemning her. If you believe that is the Pro-Life message you are completely off the message (not a surprise, the media tries to demonize pro-lifers)\n \n \n \n \n \n \nThen why continue with these ineffective methods? Criminalization will just make abortion unsafe and give lifers a reason to pat themselves on the back, nor will you win hearts and minds with villification and trivialization.\n\n Once again, refer to earlier in this discussion. Country's that outlaw abortion see decreases in abortion rates. Do you have logic for why outlawing abortion would have no effect?\n \n \n \n \nThey can be. Many women are misogynistic. My father's mother comes to mind.\n\n So pro-life women are pro-life because they don't want women to have rights...please. Try again. Pro-life women realize that abortion is killing.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nDon't be daft. Forcing a woman through a pregnancy against her will is controlling HER body.\n\n Forcing a woman through pregnancy. Read that line. Forcing. Nobody forced the woman to get pregnant. Nobody forced her to have sex. And for the sake of God get it in your head that a fetus is NOT PART OF HER BODY! Yes, pregnancy effects women in many ways but abortions do not attempt to relieve these attitudes, their purpose is to kill an individual child.\n \n \n \n \nI get that. I just don't believe that the fetus' right to be born supercedes the rights of woman to have complete and total autonomy of their body.\n\n The fetus is not her body. She has every right to control her own body. When having sex, she knew that pregnancy was a possible option. She chose what to do with her body in the act of sex. Now she is faced with the responsibility of a child due to that sex. That child is NOT part of her body. She has absolutely no right to kill it.\n \n I understand that you believe women should have control over their bodies.\n I understand the many reasons women have abortions such as career, poverty, fear, and even guilt or shame when faced with family.\n I agree that we must educate people more about pregnancy and encourage people to practice abstinence if they do not want a child.\n I understand that a pregnancy can be both physically and emotionally hard for a woman. I understand every point made in favor of abortion.\n \n But each point ignores the main reason pro-lifers believe abortion is wrong. It kills a growing human being that is inside of the woman because of the natural process that is occurring due to sex. That child has every right to live! You shock me when you say that a baby born six months into pregnancy can not be killed but a baby in the womb after six months can be. That is honestly reminiscent of the idea of slavery. Two people, the only difference being skin color. Now the only difference is where the child is. The same idea of ownership over property is used today, but property is substituted with body.\n \n When slavery was abolished the southern plantation owners suffered terrible economic problems as the economy was destroyed. POVERTY.\n \n They were emotionally hurt as the witnessed their entire life crumble before them and watch as slaves that they paid for left. I can imagine how devastating it must have been for their entire families to go through. EMOTIONAL.\n \n But did those negative effects justify slavery? NO.\n Does the economic status and emotional effects of pregnancy on a woman justify abortion? NO.\n \n At least draw the parallel and acknowledge why abortion is so morally evil.",

I do not value the fetus more. I value the life of the fetus and the mother equally. If I had to choose between the LIFE of the fetus and the mother, I would most likely choose the mother.

Your analogy actually supports my point that the two are equal...\n \n \n \n \nAny child already born can be given to somone else to care for. You can't hand your pregnancy over to someone else to manage for awhile.\n\n Most parents will not hand over their newborn infants to someone else to take care of so they can have a break.

Are you trying to claim that pregnancy has nothing to do with a woman's body? If so, you need a biology lesson.\n\n Odd you would think I am trying to claim that, considering I have acknowledged the affects of pregnancy on a woman's body. My claim is that a fetus is NOT part of the woman's body. You apparently agree. Which would mean your position is in favor of killing a human being for the benefit of the woman.\n \n \n \n \nAnd I question your conclusion. The Guttmacher Institure is a well-respected organization that has been around a long time. They work with the WHO. People on both sides of this issue trust them. I also know me. The legality of abortion would not impact my decision to have one. I know my line in the sand.\n\n The evidence Guttmacher gave was for the most part correct. The problem was within the analysis. It claimed that because abortion rates were similar in developed countries and developing countries, the legality of abortion therefore made little or no difference. The problem is, developing countries have such different societies and governments that they really cannot accurately compare to developed countries. Furthermore, the study didn't even compare abortion rates in countries were abortion was legal and illegal. It just said that \"most\" developing countries have illegal abortion and \"most\" developed countries have legal abortion. The countries that do not fall into that \"most\" can affect the outcome of the results. Even with this said, it is only fair to compare developing countries with legal abortion to developing countries with illegal abortion, or do the same for developed countries. We need to try to isolate the \"legality\" variable as much as possible.\n The most accurate way to determine the effects of the legalization of abortion would be to compare two similar countries of similar economic status or simply compare the US with its past. Comparing both, the legalization of abortion has created a higher abortion rate. I already made this point and explained it in depth with electrolyte. He had no response to it other than \"thinking doesn't matter\". He has since fled the conversation.\n \n \n \n \nWasn't using it as justification.\n\n Odd...why is it that you keep saying a woman has the right to an abortion because she has control of her body? Abortion kills the fetus of a woman, which is not part of her body. \n \n \n \n \nAnd this is where I stop this debate with you. I will let you figure out why.\n\n Because you are at a loss of what to say. You ignored the majority of my post. I presume you either didn't read it or simply didn't want to try to accept it. This is the EXACT type of close-mindedness I am talking about that so many Pro-death advocates have.\n Say I was having emotional problems so I killed my son. Is that ok because of the reasons?\n Say I needed more money, so I killed my grandfather and received my inheritance. Does that reason justify anything?\n I am worried that my parents will discover a child that my girlfriend already gave birth to. Does that fear justify at all the killing of it?\n The reasons for having an abortion really DONT matter. They don't at all justify the fact that an innocent life is being taken away. You quit this argument because it is to my current understanding that you cannot find away to argue against this.",

   "Gee Lakrite, I guess Jito has gone MIA in regard to responding to these posts. emoticon_xchicken emoticon_xbye \n \n \nIts nothing personal. Its honestly how I feel. The idea that you, the government, or any other stranger would usurp my right to make intimate medical decisions for myself puts me in a panic. Its like a strangle-hold on my throat. Its a violation. As a matter of fact when W became president I was so worried about my reproductive rights that I got my tubes tied. I wasn't even sexually active at the time. I'm still not. (Maybe you have caught on to the fact that I am brutally independent.)\n\n \n What you are is incredibly emotional, paranoid and over reacting in your fear of even the expectation of being required to take responsibility for your own actions in the face of even the possibility of not being able to kill an innocent child who did nothing to create the perceived problem his potential existence represents to such narcissistic women.\n \n \nGirls whose lives will be meaningless if they do not have liberty. I don't believe you have respect for women at all. I think many lifers do, but not you. Your next statement would be why.\n\n \n Only in the mind of a true fascist is the loss of the right to kill innocents for the sake of the responsible parties personal comfort and actions considered a loss of liberty. You attempt to sound patriotic, deep and soulful when everything you say results in and represents the death of the totally innocent who have no voice to defend themselves. \n \n \nA) This is really patronizing and you can take it and go to hell. Grown women are perfectly capable, intelligent beings. They don't need a some misogynist daddy figure telling them whats best for them.[/]\n\n \n Really? I would worry more about myself and where I'll end up if I were you Jito. You call women who contribute to the deaths of at least 1 million healthy babies per year intelligent and perfectly capable? If they are so capable then why do they choose to kill their own children rather than take responsibility for them? And before you fall back on the ole rape excuse, they represent less than 1% of annual abortions.\n \n Here is more evidence of the reprobate world view you embrace Jito. What is at all patronizing or misogynistic about this statement? I said this: And that the side affects from abortions which you so easily ignore are very real and damaging to the spiritual, physical and emotional security of the women who fall victim to this culturally encouraged and accepted form of genocide?\n \n This is an expression of concern and compassion, yet you interpret it as patronizing and misogynistic since it doesn't embrace your desire to allow only women out of every segment of our population to make the decision to kill perfectly healthy babies for reasons of personal convenience.\n \n \nB) Nobody is out there encouraging women to have abortions. They always have and always will. They can just do so safely and legally now -- if they choose to.\n\n \n Really? You actually believe that statement in bolded print? You are either completely naive, totally uninformed or willfully ignorant Jito. Get a load of this as just one investigatory example that the purveyors of death represent when they think nobody is watching. Here are numerous examples on video and with explanations so you can see that it isn't the welfare of children or a public health service which these monsters are dedicated to, but the all mighty dollar at any and all cost for this billion dollar industry. \n \n And it is mindless sheeple like you, chester, simone and antonia whom they brainwash and rely on to defend their philosophy of death on forums like this. You must be so proud when you see the quality of people you are defending. Just remember Jito, that makes you one of them. You must take personal responsibility for supporting what you endorse as right and good. Watch these videos and read the articles if you have the courage to see the practices that you are defending.\n \n Planned Parenthood gets caught covering up statutory rape... again (Wizbang) \n \n And here's the most recent case just exposed last week, I believe. This one is about a girl they believe is 14 years old who was a victim of statutory rape by a 31 year old man and told to lie about her age in order to qualify for an illegal abortion. I suppose in your mind that qualifies as a public service, huh!\n \n Lila Rose catches Planned Parenthood covering up another case of statutory rape (Wizbang)\n \n Go on Jito, make excuses and justify these atrocities and examples of the human carnage endorsed and supported by liberals as you dare to call me the misogynist. emoticon_ic\n \n AND DON'T BLAME ME IF YOU FIND THIS POST PERSONALLY INSULTING, BECAUSE NOTHING I HAVE WRITTEN IS A PERSONAL ATTACK AT ALL.

   "As to who is the true fascist herein... yes.\n \n As to whether or not Jitobear is a responsible person, from my observations, she most assuredly is. Simply labeling someone as irresponsible doth not make it so.\n \n As to who is very, very patronizing, I need say no more...\n \n And as to the rest of the folderol...\n\n All I can do in response to this drivel is to repost the the original response which you are referring to, and which Jito has run away from responding to. That alone should show how clueless you are in your biased opinion.\n \n =========================================================================================================\n \n \nIts nothing personal. Its honestly how I feel. The idea that you, the government, or any other stranger would usurp my right to make intimate medical decisions for myself puts me in a panic. Its like a strangle-hold on my throat. Its a violation. As a matter of fact when W became president I was so worried about my reproductive rights that I got my tubes tied. I wasn't even sexually active at the time. I'm still not. (Maybe you have caught on to the fact that I am brutally independent.)\n\n \n What you are is incredibly emotional, paranoid and over reacting in your fear of even the expectation of being required to take responsibility for your own actions in the face of even the possibility of not being able to kill an innocent child who did nothing to create the perceived problem his potential existence represents to such narcissistic women.\n \n \nGirls whose lives will be meaningless if they do not have liberty. I don't believe you have respect for women at all. I think many lifers do, but not you. Your next statement would be why.\n\n \n Only in the mind of a true fascist is the loss of the right to kill innocents for the sake of the responsible parties personal comfort and actions considered a loss of liberty. You attempt to sound patriotic, deep and soulful when everything you say results in and represents the death of the totally innocent who have no voice to defend themselves. \n \n \nA) This is really patronizing and you can take it and go to hell. Grown women are perfectly capable, intelligent beings. They don't need a some misogynist daddy figure telling them whats best for them.[/]\n\n \n Really? I would worry more about myself and where I'll end up if I were you Jito. You call women who contribute to the deaths of at least 1 million healthy babies per year intelligent and perfectly capable? If they are so capable then why do they choose to kill their own children rather than take responsibility for them? And before you fall back on the ole rape excuse, they represent less than 1% of annual abortions.\n \n Here is more evidence of the reprobate world view you embrace Jito. What is at all patronizing or misogynistic about this statement? I said this: And that the side affects from abortions which you so easily ignore are very real and damaging to the spiritual, physical and emotional security of the women who fall victim to this culturally encouraged and accepted form of genocide?\n \n This is an expression of concern and compassion, yet you interpret it as patronizing and misogynistic since it doesn't embrace your desire to allow only women out of every segment of our population to make the decision to kill perfectly healthy babies for reasons of personal convenience.\n \n \nB) Nobody is out there encouraging women to have abortions. They always have and always will. They can just do so safely and legally now -- if they choose to.\n\n \n Really? You actually believe that statement in bolded print? You are either completely naive, totally uninformed or willfully ignorant Jito. Get a load of this as just one investigatory example that the purveyors of death represent when they think nobody is watching. Here are numerous examples on video and with explanations so you can see that it isn't the welfare of children or a public health service which these monsters are dedicated to, but the all mighty dollar at any and all cost for this billion dollar industry. \n \n And it is mindless sheeple like you, chester, simone and antonia whom they brainwash and rely on to defend their philosophy of death on forums like this. You must be so proud when you see the quality of people you are defending. Just remember Jito, that makes you one of them. You must take personal responsibility for supporting what you endorse as right and good. Watch these videos and read the articles if you have the courage to see the practices that you are defending.\n \n Planned Parenthood gets caught covering up statutory rape... again (Wizbang) \n \n And here's the most recent case just exposed last week, I believe. This one is about a girl they believe is 14 years old who was a victim of statutory rape by a 31 year old man and told to lie about her age in order to qualify for an illegal abortion. I suppose in your mind that qualifies as a public service, huh!\n \n Lila Rose catches Planned Parenthood covering up another case of statutory rape (Wizbang)\n \n Go on Jito, make excuses and justify these atrocities and examples of the human carnage endorsed and supported by liberals as you dare to call me the misogynist. emoticon_ic\n \n AND DON'T BLAME ME IF YOU FIND THIS POST PERSONALLY INSULTING, BECAUSE NOTHING I HAVE WRITTEN IS A PERSONAL ATTACK AT ALL. YOU ARE CONVICTED BY THE TRUTH OF THIS POST, NOT BECAUSE IT IS DIRECTED ONLY AT YOU. BECAUSE THIS IS DIRECTED AT EVERY SINGLE PRO ABORTION ADVOCATE OUT THERE. NUFF SAID!!! ",
