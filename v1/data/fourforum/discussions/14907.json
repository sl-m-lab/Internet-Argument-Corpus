   "sprint cars are so weird. i dont understand how they work! i always assumed that huge spoiler would add too much drag.\n\n \n It's not really a spoiler, it's an upside-down wing. It creates downforce by that pulls the car down into the track. The faster you go, the more downforce you create. The tip plates on the sides of the wing create sideforce that pushes (and pulls) the car to the inside of the track. This is important because it allows better cornering at higher speeds, and helps prevent the car from flipping towards the outside of the track. They also prevent air from \"leaking\" around the edges of the wing and destroying the downforce that the wing is creating. \n \n The nose wing helps to keep the front end planted on the track. Both wings do add a bit of drag, but it is really negligible when compared to the horsepower that a 360 sprint car engine produces (700+). A 410 sprint car engine can pump out about 810 horespower when tuned properly! It's about the same HP Nascar stock cars have, in a car that weighs considerably less than a stock car.",
