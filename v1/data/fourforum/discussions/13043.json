Certainly people are going to abuse it, but we shouldnt dwell on that.\n\n \n \nYou gotta understand that the system cannot allow everyone to be doing well all at the same time.\n\n \n Why? Why, if everyone makes good decisions and is accountable for their own actions, can't the system \"allow\" everyone to be doing well at the same time? Explain how the system distinguishes between those who succeed and those who fail if those being judged all make the right decision. \n \n \nSo we collectively enacted a system to help those people that are not doing well.\n\n \n WHY are they not doing well? This is vague. Not doing well because they made BAD CHOICES, or not doing well because of EXTERNAL CAUSES? I have no problem with supporting those who make good decisions and face hardship from external causes. They aren't responsible for things that affect them through no fault of their own. If someone applies themselves, makes good decisions, and lives a productive and law abiding lifestyle, there should be a mechanism for support. Although unemployment benefits are socialistic in nature, I have no problem with the existance of unemployment benefits. However, where's the justification for offering support to those who suffer hardship through their own CHOICE? Since they CHOOSE to drop out of school, since they CHOOSE to develop a criminal record, since they CHOOSE not to apply themselves for their own betterment, WHY SHOULD THEY BE OFFERED A SUPPORT MECHANISM other than to enable them to continue making bad choices and continue receiving support?\n \n \nCertainly people are going to abuse it, but we shouldnt dwell on that.\n\n \n KAPOW! Of course! There's an 800 pound gorilla in the room and your remedy is to not \"dwell on that\".\n \n Yeah. If a complete and utter failure of a program I supported was staring me in the face, I wouldn't want to dwell on that either. When faced with the options #1) wonder WHY it is a failure or #2) stick my head in the sand, I would choose #1.\n \n Does anyone wonder why, when given the option of making difficult choices in order to work for you own benefit, or doing nothing and receiving those benefits anyway, there will be those of us who will readily choose the EASY WAY, even though it is to the detriment of those who choose the hard way?\n \n Do you think, maybe, if we stop REWARDING lazyness, there might be some incentive to BE PRODUCTIVE?\n \n Or, as you reccommend, should we just not \"dwell on that\"?",

I see a thread in another forum category stating \"The rich are NOT superior!\"...\n \n .......Absolutely correct. Then, if they are not superior, why are they responsible for supporting everyone else? Why do people believe that taxing the rich is morally superior to taxing them at the same percentage as everyone else? After all, they're not superior are they? Take a look at various foundations. The Bill Gates Foundation, the Tiger Woods Foundation, The Joe Schmo Foundation.....all these foundations that cost BILLIONS of dollars and who's sole purpose is to benefit the less fortunate. Look up the top 10.....heck the top 1000 donations to any charity and you will find.....at the end of your search......a rich person.\n \n Yet these people are just puppets of huge, heartless, corporations who's sole purpose is to sponge money out of the poor, at the expense of the working man, right?\n \n Take a good long look from a distance.

   "When I wrote \"you get hate & envy acted out under the guise of moral indignation & virtue\" I wasn't thinking about the thread entitled \"The rich are NOT superior!\". I was thinking more about the thread entitled, \"Extremism, hate speech & moral equivalency.\"\n \n Be that as it may. I agree it's wonderful that there are wealthy people that do good things for those less fortunate through charitable organizations & the like. However, when you wrote, \"We strut around like Joan of Arc. We're all heros in our own minds, out to slay the dragon of the \"evil rich\" all the while holding our hands out to catch the droppings of gold,\" I immediately thought of the belief system/economic theory known as voodoo, trickledown, supply-side, etc. That is the underlying belief of the voodoo system, that is, give more to the rich so they can trickle down the droppings of gold to everyone else. \n \n I don't hate or envy the rich. But I also do not believe they are supporting everyone else. If that were the case ... Rather I think more along the lines that they are people just like anyone else, some inclined to be this way or that, they haven't escaped human nature.

Socialism (where the government controls ALL the resources and it's people rely solely on the government's \"charity\" aka \"welfare\") is extremely problematic.\n \n This is why I advocate a free market.

   "I think the USA is best described as a mixed economy. There are facets of both capitalism & socialism (& more) in the present inter-related systems. \n \n The entanglement of politics, economics & religion continues to vex.

I don't believe there is any one system or sub-system that will act as \"savior.\" It's sort of disturbing to me when I hear the mantras or to hear \"believers\" in various economic theories sometimes referred to as \"faithful disciples.\" bbbrrr\n \n I think these sort of faith-based belief systems, which look to one system as \"savior,\" sometimes lead to a way of thinking similar to a plantation or serfdom mentality. When these types of systems were the status quo, very few people could imagine a better way of doing things, & of course, things could always be worse. When THAT is the mind-set, it may become a self-fulfilling prophecy & things remain that way, i.e., the status quo. \"The status quo bias is a cognitive bias for the status quo; in other words, people tend not to change an established behavior unless the incentive to change is compelling.\" (unsure of source? wikipedia?)\n \n I think it takes courage to imagine a potentially better, albeit different way of doing things.
