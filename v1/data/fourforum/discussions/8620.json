   "In the USA, a large part of the crime rate is caused by a too-lenient justice system. Most of the crimes are committed by a very small percentage of the population. It's the same guys who commit the crimes, are sometimes caught and prosecuted, and are back out on the streets very soon to do it all over again, and again, and again.\n \n The solution to crime rates is long, long, looong prison sentences. Taking that small percentage of people who commit crimes repeatedly and locking them away from society reduces the crime rate drastically. \n \n Almost every crime we read about is committed by someone who has a long record of arrests.The very FIRST time someone commits a crime that involves even the threat of violence, they should be taken off the streets until they are too old and feeble to do it again. That is the ONLY way to bring crime rates down. Anything else is just playing a game.\n \n Not all crimes are committed with guns. The bad guys wll commit crimes with or _without_ guns.\n \n If they can't get guns, they use knives, clubs, or they just gang up on their victims and prevail by sheer weight of numbers.\n \n Often, they simply use superior muscle, as in cases in which elderly people are victimized in their homes by intruders. I think of this example because I am growing old and would have a tough time fighting off a younger, stronger guy with my stiff, arthritic joints. But I can still see and I can still shoot accurately. (I've had to resort to lighter-recoiling, smaller-caliber pistols to ease the pain in my wrist when I practice my shooting skills -- I'd rather have my old .40 caliber, but my 9mm pistol is adequate.)\n \n But dealing with violent criminals is not a sporting contest -- even a young, healthy, strong man is taking a foolish chance if he thinks he can deal with a violent criminal without a weapon of his own. The last thing a potential victim should want is a fair fight. You should want an \"unfair\" advantage. Life-threatening confrontations are rare, but they DO HAPPEN, and no one is immune. \n \n Women living alone particularly need something to give them an advantage over an attacker who has superior physical strength. \n \n A handgun with which one is familiar and proficent is an equalizer. It makes a physically weak person capable of self-defense in situations in which they would be helpless victims if they were unarmed.\n \n Laws that attempt to make guns generally unavailable only deprive people who obey laws of effective self-defense weapons. The criminals will still have the advantage. They will get guns if they want them, and even without guns they still have an advantage over the victims they choose. And they are emboldened if they can feel pretty sure their victim does not have a gun. \n \n When the law disarms everyone who obeys laws, the criminals know they can attack with little chance of being hurt.",
