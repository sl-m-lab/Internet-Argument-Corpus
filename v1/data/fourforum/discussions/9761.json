   "Is this the best way type of sex-education???\n \n (New York City) A national HIV/AIDS activist organization says that the Bush administration is to blame for a major increase in the number of drug-resistant cases of gonorrhea.\n \n \"The Bush administration's response to STDs in the US has ranged from apathetic to actively harmful,\" Sean Barry, Director of Prevention Policy for the Community HIV/AIDS Mobilization Project said in a statement.\n \n The organization blames the administration, and the formerly GOP-controlled Congress of under funding HIV education and the promotion of Abstinence Only programs in schools.\n \n The Community HIV/AIDS Mobilization Project, known as CHAMP, has offices in New York, Los Angeles, and Providence, Rhode Island.\n \n It said that sex education is a concern for activists who fear that advances that have been made in reducing the rates of some STDs \"are being reversed due to the Bush administration's focus on so-called abstinence-only programs.\"\n \n A 2004 report by Congressman Henry Waxman's staff found that federally-funded abstinence-only-until-marriage curricula contained \"major errors and distortion of public health information,\" including inaccurate information about STDs.",

When did it become the \n governments responsibility to educate children on the subject of STD's and sex?\n A dedicated parent would teach their children about sex and the drawbacks of the loose penis/vagina.STD's. Sex used wrong can kill you. I do think that human sexuality is a part of biology and offered at the high school level. Parents also need to keep the relationship with the teens so that this communication is possible. But, I still think this is a parents responsibility.",
