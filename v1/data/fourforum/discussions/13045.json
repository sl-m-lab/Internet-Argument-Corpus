   "I was wondering if there was anyone else that believes as I do that women should be given a choice but still hope they choose life.\n \n I have two sisters, one who is into witchcraft and the other who is married to a golf professional. Both sisters had almost the same as my own upbringing (Christian home, kicked out around 15 years old, redeemed back around 17), but we all three chose different paths as we hit our later teen years.\n \n One sister watched the move \"the craft\" and decided to follow Wicca. She became pregnant around the age of 20 and was not married. She chose to have her child and offered it up for adoption; the child was adopted by a very wealthy family of studio execs that live in Hollywood. She later had a nude wedding and was married to her husband. She had another child which she decided to keep. Her style of mothering is... unorthodox to say the least. She openly cursed around her child so that he would not see the words as special and would not seek to use them as any child does with what is \"forbidden\". It didn't work; the child is ignorant to the point that some teachers think he is mentally handicapped and is a total brat- a creative brat, but a brat.\n \n The other sister was more into drugs and for several years my mother told me she was a prostitute and forbade me to speak to her. I later found out that she had become pregnant and decided to raise her child as a single mother and cleaned up. She used to hustle men to get money, but never did anything involving sex which is where my mother got the notion of prostitution which in a way it was, but she stopped this practice after having a child. This sister was a social outcast from my family despite being, in my view at least, the most intellectual. She later met a retired motorcycle side-car racer who was presently a teaching golf professional. They later became married and live in a wealthy neighborhood; she provides all the best that she can afford for her son, whom I am convinced is destined for greatness. This kid was beating me in monopoly when he was five and I was fifteen, and I am now in school for my Astronautical Engineering major.\n \n Since I am a male, my views may be somewhat twisted in that I have a fourth option however immoral it might be: run as fast as I can. For the sake of focus, I'm taking it off of the table.\n \n I was kicked out of my house three times throughout my childhood. As such, I learned to be very self-sufficient and somewhat emotionally-detached at a very early age. I've been to more high schools than there are grades in school for a doctor. I've been to several parties too many and never been on the safe side of things. Suffice to say, I don't think I could have the courage my sisters did if faced with a similar situation even though I am in a much better place than they were at this age by the grace of God and the forgiveness of my father. Thankfully, I have never had to worry about an accidental pregnancy, but God knows I've freaked out several times when I thought I might be.\n \n I say all of this because any of these situations could seem like a textbook abortion scenario and it ended in life. Whether for good or for worse I am thankful to live in a country where there is a choice, even if I wish for all to choose life regardless of the consequences.",

For the life of me, I can not see how you can defend your position using the Constitution but I guess that's something you don't want to explore any further than we already have.\n\n \n \n I'm glad to be your hero. I don't know how much impetus I'm feeling to defend my position since the Supreme Court and the law of the land seem to agree with me.\n \n \nSo, why? iI it's all so settled with you and you don't want to have to explain or defend your position (or provide a basis for your claims),.... why do you bother engage in these discussion at all?\n\n \n Again, you keep asking me to explain and 'defend' my position and I have. My position is that a woman's right to walk into a Doctor and make decisions about her body does not require nor ALLOW us to interpose ourselves into the exam room. She should have the right embryo removed and control her own body. That's my explanation. My defense is US Law. \n \n \nHonestly, If I had your position and was as convinced as you seem to be,... I would get the hell out of here and other threads like it and move on to something else. In fact, that's the most tempting and appealing aspect of your comments!\n\n \n I'm still hear waiting for your answer to my questions, namely...\n \n Should we then appoint lawyers to represent the fetuses in cases of rape or incest? If they're constitutionally protected they have the right to due process. What about when the mother's life is at stake? How would that mitigate the constitutional rights of the fetus?",

READ THAT AGAIN. \"The reason that I support a \"rape \n exception\" to any \"ban on elective abortions\" is because I view \"ALL\n \"ALL\" pregnancies as a THREAT to a woman's life.\" AND AND AND\n Because I see a CLEAR distinction that can be made, between a \n THREAT to a woman's life that she \"consents to\" (consentual sex). \n And a threat to her life that was FORCED upon her (RAPE).\n \n In my opinion, which NO-one has to accept, unless they are compelled \n by my reasoning,....

If the child is putting your \n life in imminent danger, and you did not invite that threat??? \n \n In my opinion, in that case (Rape),... sad as it is to see a child killed...\n In cases of rape, it's justified as \"self defense\". But, also in my opinion,\n you can't INVITE (consent) a child into your pressence and then Kill them \n for being a threat. \"WITHIN REASON\".\n \n Because, I also support the \"life of the mother exception\". Where-in, \n even in a \"consentual\" pregnancy a \"normal\" \"managable\" amount of risk \n (threat) can become \"un-managable\".

   "Ok Chuz, if all pregnancies are a threat to the woman's life and she must consent to the threat, what about in cases of failed birth control? Must a woman be either celibate or raped to control the threats to her life?\n\n \n It's a valid question.\n \n I believe I also addressed this in that old debate; \n \n Rocket continued<<< And I further note that you won't come out and clearly state that your position means that possessing birth control pills should be a crime. Birth control pills stop pregnancy in a number of ways, including stopping the implantation of a zygote. Which means they kill people, according to your understanding of what makes a person a person.\n \n  I don't know how many times I have to repeat myself. \"IF IT KILLS THE CHILD AFTER IT IS CONCEIVED I AM AGAINST IT\". On the surface, it seems cut and dry, given my position. IT SHOULD BE BANNED. But of course, it's not that simple. Because, while I believe YES that a fetus is a \"person deserving of his/her right to their life from the moment of their conception\".... I also have to consider that the \"pill\" (birth control pills) are taken \"prior to conception\" with the intent of preventing the pregnancy. And not with the intent of killing a child. \n \n So, there's that aspect to consider. Another aspect that I consider is that while a child has a right to their life, from the moment their life\n begins,... they may NOT have a right to live off their mother's body,... if she's done everything she could do to prevent it. But alas,. the woman takes the \"pill\", Knowing full well that the \"pill\" is NOT 100% effective in preventing pregnancy. So, in \"taking the pill\", and consenting to sex,... She (and her partner) assume the responsibility, along with the risk.\n \n That's a lot to consider.\n \n \n Rocket asks<<< Is it too much to ask that you at least be up front about your desires? Say it: you believe that the Pill should be outlawed.\n \n Nope. it's not too much to ask at all. In fact, it's one of the best questions that you have asked yet. Keeping in mind that I believe that a person's life begins at their conception,.. I do NOT believe the Pill should be outlawed. And that is because I believe that using the pill (as prescribed) is with the INTENT of preventing pregnancy and not with the INTENT of killing a child. \n \n That being said, I believe that the \"pill\" should be studied, refined, improved upon etc.... to minimize the likelyhood of conception taking\n place. \n \n Time for another analogy. Every year children drown in pools. having a pool at your house with no fence, no safety guards, nothing to keep a child safe from drowning in it makes you liable if it happens. But if you have a fence. Post signs, and do everything you can (within reason) to prevent children from falling in,.... and somehow a child gets in and drowns in spite of your efforts, you are not liable. \n \n Do you see what I am getting at here? \n \n \n Rocket demands<< Make that admission clearly, and then call me names and tell me how this isn't about women, but about the rights of the unborn... despite the fact that you have already stated that the only important issue is what the mother was doing and saying immediately prior to having intercourse.\n \n Admission? Even that's a loaded word. I don't have to \"admit\" my positions, Rocky. They are what they are. And I've explained them as best I can above. If the \"pill\" is desinged to \"prevent pregnancy\" by \"preventing implantation\" I would say \"ban it\". because it kills a life after it's began. But if the design of the pill is to \"preven pregnancy\" by \"preventing fertilization\", It should (in my opinion) remain legal. EVEN if it occasionally \"prevents an implantation\". And, all efforts should be made to improve the pill to keep that from happening. --Wednesday, December 24, 2003 3:27 AM ",

How can you and Steve approve of killing a human-being just because its father was a bad guy? If the woman shouldn't be able to 'kill' a fetus that stems from consensual sex, why should she have a right to kill a rape fetus? Isn't that saying that the 'baby' isn't innocent? Isn't that taking away its rights? Isn't that murder?\n \n \n \n Update...I see Steeeve's answer further up the thread...thanks.",

Even in cases of rape; as Steeeve is speaking in their defense presently in this thread. And as we eventually got to in the ACLU forums,... and as you eluded to in your remark that you oppose \"late term abortions,\"... The long a raped victim waits to report the attacks,.... the louder the voice in defense of the child will be. And this is consistent with most other crimes. If someone breaks into your house and you wait a year to report it,.... you somehwat own the consequences. \n \n 3 Steeeve and I do not agree on the justifications for an abortion in cases of rape, Cunx. Not yet, anyway. And I don't know that we ever will. But for my part, when an woman aborts her child in a rape pregnancy it's not to punish the child for the acts of his/her father. That's a total mischaracterization of what's taken place. A woman has a right to protect herself against threats against her health and life that have been forced upon her. In fact, forcing a woman who is pregnant as a result of being raped is tantamount to raping her all over again. \n \n 4 Already explained this. \"You can't invite someone into your home and then kill them for tresspass and claim it was self defense.\" \n \n 5 Only if you twist it to make it seem so. You see our laws regarding 'self defense' do not require (as I said earlier) that 'guilt or innocence' be established. Only that one acts on the 'reasonable belief' that the threat is real and can't be avoided and that subsequently excessive force will not be used. \n \n 6 No more so than the killing of anyone else in an act of self defense can be twisted around to make it seem as though the attackers rights are being denied. No.\n \n  7 No. A justified act of self defense is not murder even if the person killed was not intentionally threatening or aware that they were posing a threat.\n \n Tragic? \n \n Yes. But in these cases it is the Rapist who is ultimately responsiblefor the child's death. Not the raped- victim/ woman.",
