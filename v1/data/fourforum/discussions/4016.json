   "I watched a \"based on a true story\" documentary last night on ch. 49 , about a family in Georgia that had moved in to a house they said had hants (ghosts) in it. Now, a religous person may believe those people when they see the show , and believe what that family went though in their home with the visiting entities, as being true. But, I wonder what the non - believers will say, if and when , they choose to see it ? Is this \"true story\" given by the terrified family a testimony of a \"real\" afterlife gone wrong ? Or, are we to just take the show as pure sensationalism in its entirety, and write it off as babble ??",

   "What ??? No takers on this topic ?? We have a forum here full of biblical scholars that have taken the art of cut and paste to the highest level. :) Hundreds of thousands of words have been posted here quoting scripture , like the poster is reading it from the NY Times. Is there no one here willing to tread on the paranormal side, and debate about what these people are saying that happened to them ? Hmmm now, maybe you guys are afraid it may conflict with your biblical beliefs.... \n \n After all, if what these people from Georgia experienced is true, then that would mean \"spirits\" are indeed living in another realm here on earth now . And if they are, that kind of shoots the old , \" The dead will be raised again on judgement day \" scripture, in the foot eh ???? And if the entities are walking among us, does that mean they have already been judged and the earth will be their eternity ?? Is it not true that the whole foundation of the Bible is built on the promise of a great herafter for our souls, if we do what our Christian teachings have taught us, while living in our mortal bodies? What happened to these ghostly visitors , if they indeed exist , that they were not allowed to lie in their entombments until judgement time ??",

This is the second time I have watched these people, the first time they were on a show on TLC about America's most haunted places. These people were just a rural blue collar family, trying to set up a home in a modest little ranch house. \n \n As I watched them being interveiwed , you could see the fear and troubled look in these peoples eyes, as they described their experiences with their new homes \"visitor's\". They may have been looking for media fame, I dont know, but we all know that when a person speaks of ghosts or UFO\"S publically, they are subject to be escorted away by the guys that install those designer jackets, the ones that button up in the back . Seems like risky media grabbing to me ....\n \n I could be wrong, but they seemed to have just wanted to live a peaceful life, and keep their small kids safe in their new home.
