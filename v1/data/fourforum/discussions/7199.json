   "Here is the latest.\n The Bush administration is punishing six companies in China for selling weapons to Iran. (You go Bush)\n Sactions are taking place cause the state department says there is credible evidence. These companies sold chemical weapons material, and this is not good.\n Two companies are Indian and Austrian. The state department said today, \"The United States will not provide export licenses, and will ban U.S. government purchases from these companies.\"\n China denies that it's government or it's companies have sold any sort of weapons to Iran. The CIA knows that Iran is persuing a nuclear and chemical weapons program. They have proof that the state department says was presented to congress last year.\n What the heck do sanctions do anyway? I don't understand that. Now, great rumors are speculating. My neice called and said the political section of her newspaper said the Bush administration was going to ask Iran one last time to give up the weapons, or a military strike would be made.\n I agree with a military offensive against Iran. Mainly because they are a threat. They have threatened Israel, (Wipe off the map bull) and so on.\n Some say, \"Oh, they are a little kid asking for attention. They would never nuke Israel because we would launch a bunch back at them and so on.\"\n Well, I think, they would have the nerve to attack Israel. I really do. Now, I am just speculating and thinking out loud. But, I could be wrong.\n But, why not? Iran is not the only country that hates the Israelites. Many Arab countries hate Israel. I think if Israel was attacked by an arab country ever, they would all unite in battle or something. Come on. Defend a pupose right?\n Anyway. This is scary. What are we doing? I think another thing is if we went to war with Iran or even attacked them, China would get ###### off. China and Iran have had a alliance for a long time. There is no denying it. For god sakes. We caught China giving chemical and nuclear bomb making material. \n lET ME KNOW.",
