   "(Read what banks do first!)\n \n Virtual Electronic Banks\n The basic idea of a bank is to first accept deposits from customers and then use those deposits as a basis for extending credit. The catch is that, instead of actually giving away their customers deposits, banks merely duplicate the money and back the duplicate dollars with the original deposit dollars. My idea is to allow consumers to do the same thing on their own.\n \n Private individuals could open virtual electronic banks directly with the Fed. These virtual banks would be purely electronic and entirely managed by the Fed. Individuals would not have any access to or control over them.\n \n Deposits\n Individuals who choose to open virtual banks with the Fed could then appeal to their employers to open deposit accounts in their virtual banks. By depositing funds into their employee's virtual banks, employers would create a reserve balance which their employees could use as a basis upon which to extend their own credit. These accounts would be just as liquid as any regular bank account, however, by depositing funds into their employee's virtual banks, employers would eliminate the payrolls of those employees.\n \n Credit\n Consumers who have virtual banks would be creditors instead of spenders at every point of sale. Whenever they buy something, they would be extending credit to the merchant for the price of goods. The goods they buy would immediately repay them for the credit they are extending to the merchant- transactions are balanced. Because we are extending credit, our bank reserve balances would not change nor would our deposit account balances change. The money would literally be created (duplicated) at the point of sale.\n \n Limitations\n Consumption is normally limited by income. Income is normally expressed as a certain amount of money over a certain period of time. But, consumers with virtual banks would not have incomes so, the Fed would need to limit their rate of consumption by restricting the rate at which they can extend credit. In other words, the Fed would only allow consumers with vitual banks to lend a certain percentage of their deposits- their lending potential- over a certain period of time- a lending period.\n \n There should be no problem allowing individuals with virtual banks to extend credit to themselves and each other as long as their credit is soley based on gross employer deposits. Otherwise, they could multiply their deposits indefinitely. This also serves to preserve the incentive to work. When people extend credit to themselves, they would only be converting their credit into personal income. Notice that if people didn't spend their full credit within the established lending period, their remaining credit would not roll over to the next lending period but, their income would. Of course, this could also expose them to income taxes, however, everyone could also control their income and thus govern how much income taxes they pay.\n \n Benefit\n How would this benefit our economy?\n \n ? The elimination of payrolls would greatly increase business profit margins.\n \n ? Reducing overhead would help small business a lot.\n \n ? Employment would increase especially since labor would be virtually free. This too would help small business a lot.\n \n ? If enough consumers chose to do this, income taxes alone would eventually become insufficient to meet government demand. The introduction of a transaction tax would probably be the only practical solution.",

   "This ingenious scheme looks like a large scale (and more complex) version of a Social Credit Union - which are established to help low income people with no collateral security, get access to credit without resorting to loan sharks.\n \n I'm doubtful that many individuals would be happy to relinquish personal control over their incomes/expenditures and allow \"the Fed\" to manage their money in the ways that you describe.\n \n I don't have the techical expertise to criticise this scheme purely on its financial feasibility, but my hunch is, despite its plausible ingenuity, it's really an idealistic proposal that will not appeal to the average consumer, spender, or saver.",

   "Some overall details about the US banking system:\n \n Banks haven't depended on deposits as a lending base since we went off the gold standard. Most deposits are transit funds, checking accounts in particular, where the bank makes a small profit lending that money out on an overnight basis to large scale borrowers. \n \n Loans are funded by federal reserve funds, the bank borrowing from the federal reserve, adding on a profit for consumer and business transactions. The banks primary function being the determination of creditworthiness and executing documentation, the fed controlling money supply by cost of funds loaned to banks.\n \n Fee income is any charge a banks levies on customers other than interest, and long being the most profitable segment of banking activity. \n \n 1. Much of what you're proposing already transpires with creditworthy customers, individuals and business entities. For my post, we'll consider them one and the same as other than transaction labels and consumer lending disclosure laws, they're no different to a bank.\n \n 2. The primary obstacles to your plan are:\n \n a. A lack of savings (the US has the lowest rate of savings of any developed nation), there are no actual reserves. For liquidity purposes, a bank's reserves are calculated as a percentage of liabilities to assets, operating cash for the bank to stay in busliness. \n \n b. No bank could pay out all depositor money, savings and transit funds, on demand. Nor could the federal reserve supply enough money on short notice, hence federal deposit insurance on accounts. Other than legalized gambling, illicit activites and the poor, we already live in a virtual money society controlled by the federal government. \n \n c. What you're proposing is idealistic from the viewpoint of creditworthiness. Safety controls, banks, credit unions, etc. would be eliminated and responsibility passed to individuals, not chartered entities. To comprehend the federal government extending loans to the poor (including businesses) and others based on purchases would provide absolute federal control of every citizen's wealth or lack of same, in essence every citizen would be considered equal and living at a standard limited only by transaction tax revenue. Where would the motivation to work be in the equation?\n \n d. The US is no longer a creditor nation. Where would the new wealth come from to expand the money supply to achieve this equality?",

   "There's are several contradictions in the original post, but stating any surplus credit doesn't roll over, IMO, makes it complete socialization.\n \n This type of monetary system was touted in science fiction novels 50-years ago, but with the additional step of one galactic currency distributed by class designation in the form of credits - complete and absolute control over any populous. \n \n Trusting any government to assume responsible control over a nation's wealth is Russian Roulette with all cylinders loaded. In a democracy such as the US, once the citizenry discovers it can vote money to itself by electing those who promise the most all semblance of fiscal responsibility vanishes. As we're currently experiencing.",
