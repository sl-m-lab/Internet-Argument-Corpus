   "*John Kerry meets with the Queen of England. He asks her, \"Your Majesty,\n how do you run such an efficient government? Are there any tips you can\n give to me?\"\n \n *\"Well,\" says the Queen, \"the most important thing is to surround\n yourself with intelligent people.\"\n \n *Kerry frowns. \"But how do I know the people around me are really\n intelligent?\"\n \n The Queen takes a sip of tea. \"Oh, that's easy. You just ask them to\n answer an intelligent riddle. \" The Queen pushes a button on her\n intercom. \"Please send Tony Blair in here, would you?\"\n \n *Tony Blair walks into the room. \"Yes, my Queen?\"\n \n *The Queen smiles. \"Answer me this, please, Tony. Your mother and father\n have a child. It is not your brother and it is not your sister. Who is it?\"\n \n *Without pausing for a moment, Tony Blair answers, \"That would be me.\"\n \n *\"Yes! Very good,\" says the Queen.\n \n *Kerry goes back home to ask John Edwards, his vice presidential choice\n the same question.\n \n *\"John. Answer this for me. Your mother and your father have a child.\n It's not your brother and it's not your sister. Who is it?\"\n \n *\"I'm not sure,\" says John Edwards. \"Let me get back to you on that one.\"\n \n *Edwards goes to his advisors and asks every one, but none can give him\n an answer. Finally, he ends up in the men's room and recognizes Colin\n Powell's shoes in the next stall. Edwards shouts, \"Colin! Can you answer\n this for me?\n \n *Your mother and father have a child and it's not your brother or your\n sister. Who is it?\"\n \n *Colin Powell yells back, \"That's easy. It's me!\"\n \n *Edwards smiles, and says, \"Thanks!\" Then, Edwards goes back to speak\n with Kerry. \"Say, I did some research and I have the answer to that\n riddle.\n \n *It's Colin Powell.\"\n \n *Kerry gets up, stomps over to John Edwards, and angrily yells into his\n face, \"No, you idiot! It's Tony Blair!\"",

Here's another one:\n \n George W. Bush takes his fancy new hot air balloon out for a ride. After soaring over the country side for an hour he realizes he is lost. After spotting a young girl on a farm below he descended and shouted, \"Hey little girl, can you help me? I promised a friend an hour ago I would meet him, but I don't know where I am.\" The young girl replies, \"You are in a hot air balloon over my daddy's corn field making a racket and scaring the chickens!\" Peeved, Bush says, \"Your daddy must be a Democrat.\" \"He is,\" says the girl, \"but how did you know that?\" \"Well,\" answers Bush, \"everything you told me is technically correct, but I still have no idea what to make of your information, and the fact is I am still lost. You aren't being much help.\" The girl below responds, \"You must be a Republican.\" \"I am,\" replies Bush, \"but how did you know?\" \"Well,\" says the girl, \"You're way up there full of hot air looking down on the world, you don't know where you're at and you don't know where you're going. You promised something to somebody you can't deliver on, and you were in this spot before we met but somehow your predicament is all my fault.\"",
