   "This guy has been debating me for almost a year now...I thought I would share one of his post with you. What do you guys think? The pictures did not come out...sorry about that.\n \n Ever since my debate with Raastee has ended, many talkings have been going on between me and him about this subject. So now I take the time to write once more that evolution is not science and creation makes more sense. But this isn't just for him and I; you are all welcome to comment and post questions of your own.\n \n Evolutionists have constructed the Geologic Column in order to illustrate the supposed progression of \"primitive\" life forms to \"more complex\" systems we observe today. Yet, since only a small percentage of the earth's surface obeys even a portion of the geologic column, the claim of their having taken place to form a period of rock--life--time over the earth is therefore fantastic and imaginative thinking. The lack of transitional series cannot be explained as being due to the scarcity of material. Out-of-place artifacts have been found in earth's sedimentary layers which disrupt the supposed evolutionary order. The deficiencies are real, they will never be filled. This supposed column is actually saturated with \"polystrate fossils\" (fossils extending from one geologic layer to another) that tie all the layers to one time-frame. To the unprejudiced, the fossil record of plants is in favor of special creation. Man-made artifacts, such as: the hammer in Cretaceous rock, a human sandal print with trilobite in Cambrian rock, and human footprints and a handprint in Cretaceous rock, all point to the fact that all the supposed geologic periods actually occurred at the same time in the recent past. \n \n Creation had to happen quickly as well. If we speak of the magnetic field, we would have to conclude that design is the only rational thinking. Scientists have made many careful measurements of the magnetic field over 150 years. These measurements show that the magnetic field is slowly shrinking. The intensity of the field decreases by half in 1400 years. This means that as time goes on we have less protection from cosmic radiation and the solar wind. In 560 A.D., the field was twice as strong as it is now. In David's kingdom it was four times as strong. In Noah's time it was eight times as strong. There are limits to how intense the magnetic field could have been. If we assume that the field has been decaying at the same rate for 10,000 years, the field would have been more intense than that of a magnetic star. The heat and electrical extremes from such conditions would have made life on earth impossible. This presents a significant problem for evolutionists and their belief in a 4.6 billion-year-old earth. Their answer is the dynamo theory, which assumes that the core of the earth is made of molten metal (which is an iron-nickel mixture). Molten material inside the earth is far hotter than the Curie point, which means that the earth as a whole is not a permanent magnet; it must be an electromagnet. The dynamo theory is that slow, internal convection currents or planetary rotation generates the magnetic field, and that this mechanism has operated for the assumed 4.6 billion years. This theory also claims that the field reverses over extremely long periods of time. But evolutionists still have a problem here. As sediment accumulates or as molten rock cools, the earth's magnetic field is believed to have aligned the magnetic domains within the material as it hardened, locking in a record of the orientation of the geomagnetic field at the time. Measurements of the magnetic-field polarity in ancient volcanic lava flows show that Earths magnetic field gyrated wildly at one point in time. Other evidence for a change is that the residual magnetic fields in rock formed on the ocean floor where the great tectonic plates are pulling apart show a number of different orientations. The traditional assumption here is that these processes went on at the same rate in the past as we observe today. However, during the flood, when cataclysmic geologic events were occurring at a rapid pace, these processes may have been recording what happened to the magnetic field over weeks or months instead of hundreds of thousands of years. So we see that if the earth's magnetic field moved at the same rate for all of this time except for one instance in time (when the flood occurred), then the magnetic field must only be a few thousand years old than \"millions and millions of years.\" \n \n Did you know that isolated radio halos of plonium-214 exist in crystalline granite? From physicist Robert Gentry's observations on this subject, the half-life of this element is 0.000164 seconds! To record the existence of this element in such short time span, the granite must be in crystalline state instantly. This runs counter to evolutionary estimates of 300 million years for granite to form. \n \n Petrification happens quickly too. Here are some pictures I found that prove this:\n \n Petrified Fish Giving Birth\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Petrified Chopped Wood\n \n \n \n Petrified Hat\n \n \n \n Petrified Cowboy Boot, With Petrified Leg in it \n \n \n \n Petrified Dog in Tree\n \n *\n \n So as you can see, petrification is out of the question for proving evolution. \n \n If we look into the Bible, we can find that there are many instances where it talks of things we never knew of before until today.\n \n Hydrologic Cycle, Ecclesiastes 1:7; Isaiah 55:10\n \n Evaporation, Psalms 135:7; Jeremiah 10:13\n \n Condensation Nuclei, Proverbs 8:26\n \n Condensation, Job 26:8; 37:11, 16\n \n Precipitation, Job 36:26-28\n \n Run-off, Job 28:10\n \n Oceanic Reservoir, Psalms 33:7\n \n Snow, Job 38:22; Psalms 147:16\n \n Hydrologic Balance, Job 28:24-26\n \n Springs in the Sea, Job 38:16\n \n Geology Principle of Isostasy, Isaiah 40:12; Psalm 104:5-9\n \n Shape of Earth, Isaiah 40:22; Job 26:10; Psalm 103:12\n \n Rotation of Earth, Job 38:12,14\n \n Gravitation, Job 26:7; 38:6\n \n Rock Erosion, Job 14:18,19\n \n Glacial Period, Job 38:29,30\n \n Uniformitarianism, II Peter 3:4\n \n Dinosaurs, Job 40,41\n \n Astronomy Size of Universe, Job 11:7-9; 22:12; Isaiah 55:9; Jeremiah 31:37\n \n Number of Stars, Genesis 22:17; Jeremiah 33:22\n \n Uniqueness of Each Star, I Corinthians 15:41\n \n Precision of Orbits, Jeremiah 31:35,36\n \n Meteorology Circulation of Atmosphere, Ecclesiastes 1:6\n \n Protective Effect of Atmosphere, Isaiah 40:22\n \n Oceanic Origin of Rain, Ecclesiastes 1:7\n \n Relation of Electricity to Rain, Job 28:26; Jeremiah 10:13\n \n Fluid Dynamics, Job 28:25\n \n Biology Blood Circulation, Leviticus 17:11\n \n Psychotherapy, Proverbs 16:24; 17:22\n \n Biogenesis and Stability, Genesis 1:11,21,25\n \n Uniqueness of Man, Genesis 1:26\n \n Chemical Nature of Flesh, Genesis 1:11,24-2:7;3:19\n \n Cave-men, Job 12:23-25; 30:3-8\n \n Physics Mass-Energy Equivalence, Colossians 1:17; Hebrews 1:3\n \n Source of Energy for Earth, Psalms 19:6\n \n Atomic Disintegration, II Peter 3:10\n \n Electrical Transmission of Information, Job 38:35\n \n Television, Revelation 11:9-11\n \n Rapid Transportation, Daniel 12:4**\n \n According to Raastee, the scientific method perfectly complies with evolution.*** Not true. The steps of evolution have never been observed. Stephen Jay Gould (evolutionist) said, \"In the fossil record we view our data as so bad that we never see the very process we profess to study.\" Life has never been made in the laboratory. Any random change in a complex, specific, functioning system wrecks that system. And living things are the most complex functioning systems in the universe. Science has now quantitated that a genetic mutation of as little as 1 billionth (0.0000001%) of an animal's genome is completely fatal.The genetic difference between human and his nearest relative, the chimpanzee, is at least 1.6% Calculated out that is a gap of at least 48 million nucleotide differences that must be bridged by random changes. And a random change of only 3 nucleotides is fatal to an animal. Evolution can't work, and is not scientific.\n \n This is what evolutionists believe to make a long story short (and tell me if this is real science):\n \n nothing + nothing = two elements + time = 92 natural elements + time = all physical laws and a completely structured universe of galaxies, systems, stars, planets, and moons orbiting in perfect balance and order!\n \n This fairy tale is not only stupid, but also dangerous. The common atheist believes in evolution because it is the only logical thinking they can fall back to. Let me illustrate:\n \n A creation teacher is teaching about creation when an atheist student raises his hand.\n \n \"Yes?\" says the teacher.\n \n The student explains, \"Teacher, I'm an atheist. There is no god.\"\n \n \"Then what is 'right and wrong'? You have to have standards to these thoughts or being an atheist is irrational.\" declares the teacher.\n \n The student replies, \"That's easy. I'm the god of my own universe. \"\n \n \"Well that's just wonderful because I am going to shoot you in 5 minutes.\" claims the teacher.\n \n The student exclaims, \"You can't do that!\"\n \n \"Oh yes I can. See, I'm the god of my own universe. \"\n \n Now tell me, what is wrong with this logic? If evolution is true, then you can decide anything for yourself. Nothing stops you. This is what has caused such events as the Columbine Highschool shootings. The ones who did the murders did the shooting on Hitler's birthday on purpose. One of them had the words, \"Natural Selection\" engraved on his shirt. They shot a girl because she believed in God, and a another guy because he was black. Raastee has said that natural selection proves evolution because scientists have observed kale, kohlrabi, brussels sprouts, broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower \"evolving\" from a common ancestor called brassica oleracea. This is true that they changed from this original plant, but this does not prove natural selection. All of the plants that came from brassica oleracea were made deliberately by man over the years, and they bred the plants that way on purpose. They did not \"select\" this to happen, and they were not made by chance. I do not need to discuss this further.\n \n I have already proved the Big Bang to be a big dud, so we need not go over this subject again (unless Raastee or anyone else has objective evidence for this theory.\n \n \n This is (as I have said in the subject's name) part 2 of \"Creation vs. Evolution.\" If anyone will step up to the stand and prove me wrong (and science for that matter), then please do so. I only ask that you don't take anything that I have said out of context, and especially do not post things unrelated to the subject (like Raastee has done by saying that I just \"won't accept science\"). This debate is not over--only just beginning. Creation is the answer. Not a fairy tale.\n \n \n \n *http://www.homestead.com/davidgoliathministries/proofofrapidpetrification.html\n \n **From Defender's Bible, by Dr. Henry M.

   "Against my better judgment, I will waste some time on some of this nutjob's argument.\n \n \nThe steps of evolution have never been observed.\n\n \n False. Random mutation and natural selection have been observed in the lab using bacteria; in some cases the researchers even determined exactly which mutations in the genomes produced the advantageous changes.\n \n \nStephen Jay Gould (evolutionist) said, \"In the fossil record we view our data as so bad that we never see the very process we profess to study.\"\n\n \n Worthless quote. Creationists are known for grossly quoting out of context, as well as relying on outdated sources, and, the Creationist doesn't even give a source in order to anyone to check up on his quote.\n \n Here's a Creationist-style quote for him: the Bible says, \"There is no god\". \n \n \nLife has never been made in the laboratory.\n\n \n That's not evolution. Life has evolved in the lab, many times.\n \n \nAny random change in a complex, specific, functioning system wrecks that system.\n\n \n False. Beneficial mutations in bacteria have been observed in the lab. Far from wrecking the system, they allowed the system to continue to live while those without the mutations died: the mutations improved the system's ability to survive and perpetuate itself.\n \n \nScience has now quantitated that a genetic mutation of as little as 1 billionth (0.0000001%) of an animal's genome is completely fatal.\n\n \n Bull XXXX. \n \n Best I can tell, our Creationist is confusing CAN with CERTAINLY WILL. In certain cases, a specific single nucleotide change CAN be lethal, but that's not at all what the Creationist is claiming. Although this is an imperfect analogy, to see the general flaw in his logic, consider this statement: \"Science has now shown that being in a car accident is completely fatal.\" \n \n \nThe genetic difference between human and his nearest relative, the chimpanzee, is at least 1.6% Calculated out that is a gap of at least 48 million nucleotide differences that must be bridged by random changes.\n\n \n Recent comparisons between the complete chimp genome and the human genome have found that possibly fewer than 3 million nucleotide differences exist in functional DNA.\n \n \nAnd a random change of only 3 nucleotides is fatal to an animal.\n\n \n More bull XXXX. \n \n First, our Creationist seems to forget that many millions of bases in the human genome are nonfunctional. Why would random changes to 3 or 4 of those nucleotides be fatal? They wouldn't.\n \n Besides, our Creationist is trying to make it seem like all of the millions of mutations he references - which is an invalid number - would occur in a single animal?!?!?!??!?! No, the ~1.5 million nucleotide changes in the human lineage (half the nucleotide differences between the chimp and human genomes) would have had about 6 million years to accumulate.\n \n Finally, our Creationists seems to be aware of the fact that humans differ among themselves at about 1 out of every 200 base pairs. By his reasoning, shouldn't we all be dead?\n \n \nLet me illustrate:\n \n A creation teacher is teaching about creation when an atheist student raises his hand.\n \n \"Yes?\" says the teacher.\n \n The student explains, \"Teacher, I'm an atheist. There is no god.\"\n \n \"Then what is 'right and wrong'? You have to have standards to these thoughts or being an atheist is irrational.\" declares the teacher.\n \n The student replies, \"That's easy. I'm the god of my own universe. \"\n \n \"Well that's just wonderful because I am going to shoot you in 5 minutes.\" claims the teacher.\n \n The student exclaims, \"You can't do that!\"\n \n \"Oh yes I can. See, I'm the god of my own universe. \"\n\n \n The claim that only through a belief in the Biblical God - or any God - can right and wrong be known is completely stupid. \n \n 1) Ever hear of humanism? \n \n 2) EVEN CHIMPS HAVE A SENSE OF BEING TREATED RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY! AND EVEN CHIMPS HAVE BEEN SEEN TO DO FOR OTHERS WHAT THEY WOULD WANT DONE FOR THEM!\n \n EDIT: Excuse, I double checked and I was wrong ... but that's BAD news for the Creationist!\n \n EVEN CAPUCHIN MONKEYS - WHICH ARE NOT AS RELATED TO HUMANS AS ARE CHIMPS - HAVE A SENSE OF WHETHER THEY ARE BEING TREATED FAIRLY OR NOT!!!\n http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/09/030918092951.htm\n \n Chimps take this one step farther by adding into the mix how closely their social bonds are to the other participant. So chimps have a more complex sense of fairness than do capuchin monkeys.\n http://www.whsc.emory.edu/press_releases2.cfm?announcement_id_seq=2819\n \n \nNow tell me, what is wrong with this logic? If evolution is true, then you can decide anything for yourself. Nothing stops you. \n\n \n What's wrong with that? Lots!\n \n Rational thought alone keeps a person from doing just anything s/he wants. Should I, an atheist, kill another person's children just to see if that person will then hate me? No, I shouldn't. Doing so would be grossly immoral. I guess God couldn't figure that one out for himself ... poor Job ... poor Job's children.\n \n There's also the simple fact that we moral humans recognize the difference between being treated fairly and unfairly, and we even feel empathy, both of which even chimps seem to do at at least a rudimentary level. So do you argue that chimps must already believe in God?\n \n It doesn't take religion to know of fairness or to be able to put oneself in another's shoes and consider how that person would feel based on our actions. \n \n \nThis is what has caused such events as the Columbine Highschool shootings.\n\n \n And religion is what caused the Crusades and most other wars in the past, and many wars, and bloody disputes, to this very day. Many, many, many, many, many more people have died in the name of religion than in anything that could be called \"in the name of atheism\".\n \n \nThey shot a girl because she believed in God ...\n\n \n And the religious have killed many millions more because the others did not believe in the \"right\" God.\n \n \n[They shot] another guy because he was black.\n\n \n And religious folk in the south used the Bible to justify enslavement of thousands or millions of blacks, and also to justify their treating blacks as mere property. I suppose (but am not familiar enough with all of the details to know for sure) that some even used the Bible to justify linching blacks.\n \n \nRaastee has said that natural selection proves evolution because scientists have observed kale, kohlrabi, brussels sprouts, broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower \"evolving\" from a common ancestor called brassica oleracea. This is true that they changed from this original plant, but this does not prove natural selection. All of the plants that came from brassica oleracea were made deliberately by man over the years, and they bred the plants that way on purpose. They did not \"select\" this to happen, and they were not made by chance. I do not need to discuss this further.\n\n \n Yes you do! The only thing that differed here was that selection was performed by humans instead of by nature. The same underlying rules apply in nature as in this case: if some form of a trait makes an organism more fit in a given environment, then the environment will tend to select - to preserve - that form over others, in that environment. Over time, many small changes can accumulate such that two different lineages end up with very different phenotypes. It's still selection working on top of inherited genetic variation; it's still confirmation of the underlying mechanisms involved.\n \n \nI have already proved the Big Bang to be a big dud, so we need not go over this subject again (unless Raastee or anyone else has objective evidence for this theory.\n\n \n Wow, you PROVED the Big Bang to be a big dud? I didn't see this clear refutation of a longheld scientific theory written up in any of the peer reviewed scientific journals. I must have overlooked it.

   "Evolutionists have constructed the Geologic Column in order to illustrate the supposed progression of \"primitive\" life forms to \"more complex\" systems we observe today. Yet, since only a small percentage of the earth's surface obeys even a portion of the geologic column, the claim of their having taken place to form a period of rock--life--time over the earth is therefore fantastic and imaginative thinking.\n\n \n This does not mean that the column is fantastic nor imaginative. It may very well be that not all areas of the earth accumulated all types of rock that form the column; this does not mean that the years at which similar columns were deposited in different places in the world are not similar. And of course, even if the Geologic column is not true, this provides no evidence of creationism.\n \n \nThe lack of transitional series cannot be explained as being due to the scarcity of material.\n\n \n If transitional species is a large issue to overcome, I will post my rather lengthy explanation of the lack of transitional species, but perhaps it should suffice to say that we have found some evidence of transitional species, and even if we had not, the lack of transitional species provides no evidence of creationism.\n \n \nTo the unprejudiced, the fossil record of plants is in favor of special creation.\n\n \n This is not true or requires at least more justification.\n \n \nall point to the fact that all the supposed geologic periods actually occurred at the same time in the recent past.\n\n \n Which again provides no evidence of creationism.\n \n \nCreation had to happen quickly as well. If we speak of the magnetic field...\n\n \n I don't think what he says here follows at all. He appears to claim that the Earth's magnetic field would be too strong if it had been continuously degrading at its present rate. He follows it by saying that the earth's magnetic field has not been degrading at that rate. He states that at one point, it was gyrating randomly, but makes no indication of what it was doing at any other point. So even if we were to accept his findings as science (and I am almost certain proper science disagrees with him), his statements prove nothing.\n \n \nDid you know that isolated radio halos of plonium-214 exist in crystalline granite? From physicist Robert Gentry's observations on this subject, the half-life of this element is 0.000164 seconds!\n\n \n The idea that this proves a young Earth is incorrect. This link can help explain that:\n \n http://www.skepticfiles.org/evolut/gentrypo.htm\n \n \nSo as you can see, petrification is out of the question for proving evolution.\n\n \n This neither disproves evolution nor provides evidence of creationism.\n \n \nIf we look into the Bible, we can find that there are many instances where it talks of things we never knew of before until today.\n\n \n As metioned in a post above mine, these verses prove nothing, and they certainly do not suggest creationism.\n \n \nAccording to Raastee, the scientific method perfectly complies with evolution.*** Not true. The steps of evolution have never been observed.\n\n \n Whether the steps of evolution have been observed is unrelated to whether evolution complies with the Scientific Method. The scientific method is used to provide evidence for a hypothesis by perform a study that could disprove that hypothesis. Evolution has passed every scientific test that could disprove it to date.\n \n \nAny random change in a complex, specific, functioning system wrecks that system. And living things are the most complex functioning systems in the universe.\n\n \n This is absurdity. I suppose then that medicine should wreak my body. How about viruses? Am I destroyed by them?\n \n \nScience has now quantitated that a genetic mutation of as little as 1 billionth (0.0000001%) of an animal's genome is completely fatal.The genetic difference between human and his nearest relative, the chimpanzee, is at least 1.6% Calculated out that is a gap of at least 48 million nucleotide differences that must be bridged by random changes. And a random change of only 3 nucleotides is fatal to an animal. Evolution can't work, and is not scientific.\n\n \n Ah, no this isn't true at all. Not even close, actually. The Human Genome project has never discovered anything of the sort. The average human has far more than three mutations. Just take a look here:\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mutations.html\n \n Where you may find the quote:\n \n \n The average human being has about 50-100 mutations\n\n \n Almost every human today is living fine with 50-100 mutations.\n \n \nThis is what evolutionists believe to make a long story short (and tell me if this is real science):\n \n nothing + nothing = two elements + time = 92 natural elements + time = all physical laws and a completely structured universe of galaxies, systems, stars, planets, and moons orbiting in perfect balance and order!\n\n \n Evolutionists do not likely believe we started with nothing nor with two elements nor do they believe that combining elements with time created physical laws or anything else metioned. The author here either does not believe this and is intentionally misrepresenting his opponents, or he is grossly misinformed about evolution, or both.\n \n \nThe student explains, \"Teacher, I'm an atheist. There is no god.\"\n \n \"Then what is 'right and wrong'? You have to have standards to these thoughts or being an atheist is irrational.\" declares the teacher.\n \n The student replies, \"That's easy. I'm the god of my own universe. \"\n\n \n Uh... What? This sort of response could only be dreamed up by a religious zealot looking for a reason to oppose atheism. No atheist would ever respond with \"I'm the God of my own universe.\"\n \n Further, the idea that \"you have to have standards to these things or being an atheist is irrational\" makes no sense. That sentence doesn't even mean anything at all.\n \n Unless this conversation was intended to show two people repeating nonsense to one another, it is useless.\n \n \nNow tell me, what is wrong with this logic? If evolution is true, then you can decide anything for yourself. Nothing stops you.\n\n \n And what does stop you? You could decide that for yourself. But that wouldn't make the action just or moral. That action would still hurt people, and it would still be evil.\n \n So perhaps I should ask, if God were not threatening religious people with Hell, would they still be good people? Or are all of the selfless and generous actions of religious people stemmed from the selfish desire to get into heaven? If they are not stemmed from their own selfish desire to enter heaven, then they are they not rooted in that individual's own desire to help others. This exists in some people.\n \n For those in whom it does not exist, we have the law. We create governments to do that which is in our best interest and that which is in our best interest is that which helps everyone. For that which harms someone else might soon be that which harms us.\n \n I have oversimplified what is a very complex understanding of morality, but the point is that the morality of an atheist does not begin with the desire to enter heaven, it begins with the desire to help others or create a society which will help everyone.\n \n \nThis is what has caused such events as the Columbine Highschool shootings. The ones who did the murders did the shooting on Hitler's birthday on purpose. One of them had the words, \"Natural Selection\" engraved on his shirt. They shot a girl because she believed in God, and a another guy because he was black.\n\n \n An amount of violence miniscule in comparison to the violence caused by Christians intolerant of other religion; look to the Crusades and the Inquisition if you please. Look at the justification for the slaughter of Native Americans. Look even today at the ruthless murders of gay people.\n \n But just as I would not judge all Christians by the actions of some, it is inappropriate to judge all evolutionists by the actions of some.\n \n Overall, I don't think this author brought up any legitimate point against evolution except for the lack of transition species, which is an interesting topic in itself.\n \n However, if the author had proven that the world is young, the most logical explanation would be that evolution occurred in a shorter span of time, for all of our scientific evidence points toward evolution. If the author had proven that evolution hadn't occurred, then the most logical explanation that some similar, natural process is the cause. But it is a great leap of faith to suggest that Creationism is correct.\n \n See, the author has made a mistake fatal in debate: he has attack his opponent's viewpoint, then stated that since his opponent is wrong, he is correct. But that is not true, for he has not provided any reason for us to believe that he is correct.\n \n I, for example, might be contending that a bunch of Vampires carried stones together to form the Earth, then used their magic powers to make those stones into our world today. I could have then stated exactly all of the things this author stated, only replacing those Biblical quotes with writings about Vampires, and I could have come to the same conclusion. Since the evolution is wrong, then I am right.\n \n But that's just not good enough. Even if he had proved evolution were wrong, there is no more reason to believe in the supernatural than there is to believe in Vampires, Dragons, Pixies, or any other mythological creation. This doesn't mean that those things don't exist, just that there is no reason to believe in them.",
