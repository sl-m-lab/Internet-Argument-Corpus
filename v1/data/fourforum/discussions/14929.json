   " Lugar: Reinstate the Assault-Weapons Ban \n Last week, Kevin argued that an assault-weapons ban would not have prevented the Tucson shooting. On this front, Sen. Richard Lugar (R., Ind.) breaks from the Williamson camp &#8212; he told Bloomberg News over the weekend that the ban should be reinstated:\n \n LUGAR: I believe it should be, but I recognize the fact that the politics domestically in our country with regard to this are on a different track altogether. As a matter of fact, it appears that ammunition has been purchased from stores all over the country subsequent to this by many Americans feeling that somehow the Congress might take action that would somehow limit the amount of ammunition or the types of ammunition people could have.\n\n FBI Uniform Crime Report.  These figures are for all rifle homicides, not just the so-called Assault Weapons. \n All Rifles not just so called assault weapons. \n 2003 = 392 Equaling .027 of all murders\n 2004 = 403 Equaling .028 of all murders \n 2005 = 445 Equaling .029 of all murders \n 2006 = 438 Equaling .029 of all murders \n 2007 = 450 Equaling .03 of all murders\n  2008 = 380 \n 2000 = 348 \n \n Personal weapons (hands, fists, feet, etc.)\n 2003 = 962 \n 2004 = 943 \n 2005 = 905 \n 2006 = 841 \n 2007 = 854\n  2008 = 875 \n 2009 = 801\n \n Blunt objects (clubs, hammers, etc.) \n 2003 = 650\n 2004 = 667 \n 2005 = 608 \n 2006 = 618 \n 2007 = 647\n  2008 = 603 \n 2009 = 611\n \n Knives or cutting instruments \n 2003 = 1,828 \n 2004 = 1,866 \n 2005 = 1,920 \n 2006 = 1,830 \n 2007 = 1,796\n  2008 = 1,888 \n 2009 = 1,825 \n \n All of which are higher but are not even regulated like so called Assault Weapons are! Maybe your priorities are backwards, Senator. After all, they pose less of a threat than Knives, hammers and Hands and Feet! \n \n Maybe crime is out of control? \n  Crime in the United States -- by Volume and Rate per 100,000 Inhabitants, 1990&#8211;2009 \n High = 1991 \n Violent crime rate = 758.2 Murder rate = 9.8\n Low = 2009\n Violent Crime Rate = 429.4 Murder rate = 5.0 \n \n \n  January to June 2010 \n Percent Change -- for Consecutive Years\n 2010/2009 Violent crime rate change = -6.2 Murder Rate Change = -7.1\n \n But do, Senator, concentrate on the least of all murders.

It doesn't matter how tough you are, a .30-06 is a hell of a lot tougher.\n \n \nMy point is that this isn't a 2A issue at all.\n\n \n Actually yes it is a Second Amendment issue. The magazine is a vital component to the proper functioning of many firearms, and without them they're rendered useless. You don't get to play the size argument and claim that this vital component can only be allowed in certain sizes and configurations that you agree with.\n \n Neither you nor anyone else has the authority to determine that once magazine capacity goes above a certain size, no citizen has a legitimate need for it, and that it's appropriate only for the military and police.\n \n This is nothing more than a divide and conquer attempt. Various groups realize they can't go after the guns anymore so they're going to try and go after the components. It's no different than the groups who petitioned the EPA to bad lead ammunition, knowing it's deal a death blow to firearms ownership.\n \n You can try and claim it's not a Second Amendment issue all you want.

   "You again Galileo? And once again practicing the false dichotomy of the militia argument?\n \n I usually offer up cited examples to show a point that has been made previously because I like to fight with facts on my side. But you've made this militia argument so many times, and been rebuked by everyone to the point of ad nauseam that it would be an exercise in futility to offer up anywhere near the number of previous arguments you've made and ultimately lost on this board.\n \n You've continually made this militia argument your primary argument. You've put forth every scholar that seems to agree with you on this point in an attempt to overwrite the history of gun ownership being seen as worthy of protection. And not once have you ever proven your point and shown that you're right.\n \n In light of the Heller ruling, which specified in clear and uncomplicated terms that gun ownership was not dependent on service in a government sanctioned militia, you don't have any legal ground to stand on. The argument isn't yours anymore. It's a matter of what's known as settled law. You've been told this already.\n \n \nA few observations:\n \n 1) I don't think it really matters if it is a Second Amendment issue because I no longer think that the Second Amendment is being practiced. We no longer live in a nation where you're expected to enroll in the militia at age 18 with your local militia officer. We no longer are expected to show up for militia muster on certain days of the year with our weapon. We are no longer expected to be prepared to defend the nation against invaders if Congress calls upon the militia to do so.\n\n \n I believe that when the Supreme Court ruled on the Heller matter, stating that DC's ban on handgun ownership (rather than the prohibition against serving in a militia) violated the Second Amendment, they made it clear what the nature of the amendment was. Gun ownership, not militia service, was the goal.\n \n A while back Bryan rebuked you for citing Supreme Court Justice Breyer and his dissenting opinion on the Heller ruling. I'm going to cite that now because I feel it's relevant to you ignoring your previous handling.\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/420243-post10.html\n \n \"Assume you are correct when you argue \"the motivation for writing the Second Amendment had more to do with fears that the militia would be neglected by the federal government, that the federal government would fail to arm the militia and thus leave it in a state of being unarmed as Patrick Henry worried would happen.\" My answer is this:\n \n Congress has the power-and under the Article VI supremacy clause, it wields that power exclusively-to organize, arm, and discipline the militias. The states are forbidden to do any of these things without Congressional consent.\n \n How does the 2nd. Amendment protect the militias against this power? Neither Stevens nor Breyer can explain this. Neither can, for example, show how the 2nd. Amendment was intended to amend Article I Section 8 to make disarmament impossible. If the Amendment was intended to repeal or modify Congressional power to arm (and thus disarm) the militias, then the 2nd. Amendment is very poorly worded to suit that purpose. And, if there is no hidden agenda-if Madison is only doing what the states demand-then he has no reason not to be very plain and concise. He could and should have simply said the states have a concurrent power to arm their militias if Congress fails to exercise its power to do so. And yet he didn't. But looking further, if-as Stevens argues-the Amendment only protects the state's militias against congressional disarmament, then what use is this protection if Congress also retains the unilateral power to choose who will be and who will not be a member of the militia-when Congress can deliberately set its size so ridiculously small that protecting their right to carry arms in this small body of men is hopelessly inadequate to protect the state's interests?\n \n And so I argue that if the Amendment was intended only to protect the militia from virtual disarmament and impotency by congressional neglect, then the Amendment is very poorly written and wholly inadequate to this purpose. It is no wonder that not a single founder (including Madison) could be found to have said the 2nd. Amendment means what Stevens claims-forcing Stevens, for want of direct evidence, to merely \"assume\" it must be so-all the while carefully avoiding the direct statements from our founders that show the amendment recognizes an individual right unconnected with militia service.\"\n \n You were told right there that the Second Amendment is too poorly written to qualify as having any relation to the militia and how it can be formed, regulated and disciplined. Did you simply forget that fact? I didn't.\n \n \n2) Again, we see a gross inconsistency in logic in the arguments of pro-gun activists- arguing that a high capacity magazine makes no practical difference in the hands of someone like Loughner, but also claiming that they may need such a magazine for self defense.\n\n \n Let's put aside the issue of the size of the magazines used by Loughner. For the moment let's focus on the term \"high capacity ammunition magazine\" that's usually thrown around when it comes to this discussion. And now let's look at the definition of what qualifies as a so-called \"high capacity ammunition magazine\" under the Violence Crime Control and Law Enforcement Bill Text - 103rd Congress (1993-1994) - THOMAS (Library of Congress)\n \n `(A) means a magazine, belt, drum, feed strip, or similar device manufactured after the date of enactment of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 that has a capacity of, or that can be readily restored or converted to accept, more than 10 rounds of ammunition;\n \n Right there it says that the definition of a \"high capacity ammunition magazine\" is any magazine capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. That means even an 11 round magazine (which does exist, and is made by the Glock company Glock Magazine Glock 27 40 S&W 11-Round Polymer Black - MidwayUSA) is considered a \"high capacity ammunition magazine\" despite the minor difference in terms of overall capacity.\n \n Magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition are nothing new or revolutionary. Nor are they unique or exclusive to the military. The first widespread magazines capable of holding over 10 rounds were found on the Browning Hi-Power pistol, designed back in 1914 and made available in 1935. We're talking about the era of the Great Depression, showing that the roots for such accessories and components go back a very long time. There's even information to suggest that such magazines weren't used by the military until near the end of World War Two, which means they were on the civilian market long before they were seen as viable by the military.\n \n So we have a long history of availability of \"high capacity ammunition magazines\", and the fact that the term is very broad in nature and arbitrarily sets the cut off point at an amount of 10 rounds of ammunition. We have no explanation for how such an amount was deemed acceptable when it's far lower than the capacity of standard issue magazines that were made at the same time of the guns they were made to work with. 13 and up have been standard for magazine capacity since the 9mm caliber caught on as a viable cartridge for both official duty and personal defense. Go back as far as the double stack magazine and you'll see amounts greater than 10 have been the norm since almost the beginning. To claim they're somehow unsuitable now is disregarding decades of history.\n \n And now I have questions for you Galileo. And I ask you since you've adopted these positions as your own.\n \n The first question is perhaps the most obvious. Why is is that these magazines, which have been available to the public since the Great Depression, have somehow been determined to be unsuitable for sale and possession by the general public in the late 20th and early 21st century? What changed?\n \n The second question is more in depth and I'm sure it'll be ignored because it's too hard to explain. Under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, a person was breaking the law if they attempted to sell or buy a newly manufactured magazine capable of holding 11 rounds. How exactly do you justify criminal prosecution of a person when their offense amounts to one round of ammunition? Or how about two rounds of ammunition?",

Does that sound reasonable and rational to your mind? (Sorry I couldn't help myself. Sorry. :))\n \n Actually I think I can do that. \n \n In 2000 to 2002 The CDC conducted a systematic review of scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of firearms laws in preventing violence, including violent crimes, suicide, and unintentional injury. The systematic review development team identified 51 studies that evaluated the effects of selected firearms laws on violence and met the inclusion criteria for this review. No study was excluded because of limitations in design or execution.\n \n  What did they find?  \n &#8220;the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.&#8221; \n\n The CDC did suggest more studies. Then a few years later the CDC got a second bite at the apple with The National Academy of Sciences studies. They, along with the Anti-gun Joyce foundation funded, the study. Data on Firearms and Violence Too Weak to Settle Policy Debates; Comprehensive Research Effort Needed\n \n Here is an article about the study Link  who issued a 328-page report based on 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study. \nIn short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns. \n\n \n 51 of the best gun control studies, 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study have already been done.\n \n Fundamental Right Law test.\n \nThe test requires proof of a compelling interest for the law, that the law is targeted, narrowly and specifically at addressing the compelling interest at stake, and that the law is also the least restrictive (of the right, that is) way to deal with the compelling interest.\n\n \n However, I do have some correct solutions, but I don't think you are going to like them. There isn't a gun control proposal in the bunch. Well, except for the first suggestion. \n \n For your very own protection, and maybe that of your family and others. Carry Concealed. (Gun Control. Use two hands) Get very well trained!\n \n As to what would prevent assignation attempts. The Senate's Sargent at Arms, and the assistant former director of the FBI says there is no way to prevent someone who is committed to carry it out. However, and having said that, here is an idea. Quit this partisan politics, and needless taking of people rights. And I don't mean the SLICK just say the right words stuff either. You might find that people are more reasonable when you quit trying to steal from them.\n \n Missed signs. In every occasion, when something like this happens, we always find out about the missed signs. Make Mental Health easier to get, and without stigmas attached. The American Psychiatry Board, whatever they are called, published an article before the NICS improvement act, stating that if people think they will lose their rights for seeing a mental health professional, they likely will not go. Thus risking the unintended consequences of making the problem worse and not better. \n \nI seem to remember soldiers being given advice here to conceal their PTSD for fear of losing their 2A rights.

   "It would appear that the \"existing stock\" and \"private sales\" loopholes are closed with the latest proposed law. All transfers would become illegal.\n\n \n I was going to cite several sections of the Gun Control Act of 1968 to show the language defining the illegal offense of transfer of a firearm to a prohibited individual, and the punishment such an offense can earn a person. However I'm having trouble finding the language covering the punishment and what the prison term would be.\n \n (b) It shall be unlawful for any licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector to sell or deliver- \n \n (2) any firearm to any person in any State where the purchase or possession by such person of such firearm would be in violation of any State law or any published ordinance applicable at the place of sale, delivery or other disposition, unless the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the purchase or possession would not be in violation of such State law or such published ordinance;\n \n While I can't properly cite the number of years a person can serve in prison for violate this section of the law, there's sufficient proof that knowingly transferring a firearm to a known or suspected prohibited person is a felony offense.\n \n What does any of this have to do with the issue? It's to show that even though this act is illegal it's still being carried out. There are those who are knowingly selling guns to individuals they know can't legally own them in the name of turning a quick buck.\n \n There's simply no reason to believe that should the private transfer of magazines be outlawed that said transfers will simply stop.\n \n As I said to Brady in a previous thread in response to his parroting of Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center talking points:\n \n \nAs we know, in the time leading up to the 1994 ban on \"high capacity ammunition magazines\" the various gun manufacturing companies in the country increased production to basically flood the market with more pre-ban examples than they ever normally produced. Since the end of the law in 2004 regular production has resumed and the market has become even more saturated with magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. And if McCarthy's bill is voted into law then production will just be revved up and the market flooded all over again. By the time the new law goes into effect there could very easily be tens of millions, if not potentially billions, of these magazines held in private hands, and there's not a thing you or McCarthy or law enforcement can do about it.\n \n Add to the fact that magazines, unlike the receiver of a gun, includes no traceable serial number for registration purposes, making it impossible to tell who legally owned any such magazine before the new ban, and who didn't, so there will be no way to prosecute someone for selling such a magazine to another individual.\n\n \n It's been said before and I'm going to reiterate the point. All currently possessed magazines in the hands of the civilian market have no serial numbers or other method of identification that would enable registration to any particular individual. That means currently the federal government has absolutely no way to determine who did own a \"high capacity ammunition magazine\" before the ban and who didn't, and this fact would make enforcement of the transfer ban impossible.\n \n Complicating the matter is a lack of authority by congress to pass any law that would enact a retroactive requirement that all currently owned magazines be equipped with identifying marks to ensure registration to a specific individual.\n \n In the end this \"private transfer ban\" amounts to a paper tiger. There's no way to enforce it and no way to effectively prosecute someone for violating the law. And if someone isn't prosecuted for knowingly transferring a firearm to a felon I fail to see how illegal transfer of a magazine would be anymore likely to get prosecution.\n \n Do you see the fallacy here?\n \n \nWho do you suppose fought for those loopholes in the first place? I bet I can guess.\n\n \n I don't know about you but I'm far more interested in facts that can be readily cited and presented as evidence than I am in finger pointing, accusations, insinuations and allusions to some supposed conspiracy.\n \n \nI just happen to believe that if we stop making them, importing them and selling them that it will make them scarce over time. Like anything else discontinued.\n\n \n Over time? Exactly how many decades are there in this over time scenario you're presenting? And what should we do about the meantime, during the time line in which your children will be reaching puberty and eventually early adulthood?\n \n It's nice to have something that you can believe in. But believing in something isn't sufficient evidence to prove a point when it comes to a debate like this. What's needed is proof that can be readily cited and presented as evidence and able to stand up to scrutiny and analysis by professionals trained in finding fault in matters.\n \n I choose not to naively assume that criminal entrepreneurs are ignorant of the law. This bill presented by Carolyn McCarthy has received a lot of media coverage in just the past few days. It would be foolish to believe that black market dealers aren't somehow planning for the possibility that it might become law, and stocking up on as many currently available magazines as they can, which they'll later turn around and sell to whoever is willing to pay the prices they ask.",

   "I seem to remember soldiers being given advice here to conceal their PTSD for fear of losing their 2A rights. You agree with that Mr. Tither?\n\n Vet disarmament act ramifications\n Q&A On The Veterans Disarmament Act\n -- How the new law will affect you and where we go from here\n \n Gun Owners of America E-Mail Alert\n 8001 Forbes Place, Suite 102, Springfield, VA 22151\n Phone: 703-321-8585 / FAX: 703-321-8408\n Gun Owners of America - Gun Owners Of America\n \n Tuesday, January 8, 2008\n \n \n As most Americans were preparing for the Christmas holidays last\n month, the U.S. Congress pulled another fast one when only few people\n were watching.\n \n It was December 19. Most Congressmen had left town and were either\n at the airport or in the air returning home. They weren't in\n Washington, DC, because their party leadership had told them that all\n the major votes were over... that the only legislative business left\n related to non-controversial issues, such as when Congress would\n return from Christmas break, etc.\n \n But it was then, with most of the Congress gone, that the House and\n Senate passed the Veterans Disarmament Act without a recorded vote.\n It was a huge deja vu, as this was the method that a previous\n Democratic Congress used -- together with compliant Republicans -- to\n pass the original Brady Law in 1993.\n \n \n WHO IS TO BLAME?\n \n In the fury that resulted from this \"fast one,\" many Americans have\n wanted to blame the entire lot of them... all 535 congressmen. And,\n to be sure, there is an extent to which they all share some blame.\n \n But to be fair, no one congressmen can camp out on the floor of the\n House or Senate chambers, every day, 24/7. It's a physical\n impossibility, which is why members of each party rely on their\n leadership to protect their interests and keep them informed. And\n that's where the betrayal occurred.\n \n No Unanimous Consent agreement can pass the House or Senate without\n the leaders of both parties signing off. And on December 19, the\n leaders of each party sent their members home for the Christmas\n holidays, while forging Unanimous Consent agreements in each chamber.\n \n As such, the immediate ire should be directed at the following\n legislators: Democrats such as Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi\n (D-CA) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV); Republicans such\n as House Minority Leader John Boehner (R-OH) and Senate Minority\n Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).\n \n Obviously, the backers of the Veterans Disarmament Act should be held\n to account, as well. Most of the lead sponsors were Democrats --\n such as Rep. Carolyn McCarthy (D-NY) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY).\n \n But there were a few key Republicans who helped cosponsor the\n legislation: Representatives Michael Castle (DE), Christopher Shays\n (CT) and Lamar Smith (TX). And dishonorable mention goes to Tom\n Price of Georgia who was physically present on the House floor on\n December 19. It was Rep. Price who asked for the Unanimous Consent\n agreement to pass the Veterans Disarmament Act without a vote.\n \n Finally, many of you know that Senator Tom Coburn (R-OK) held up the\n bill in the Senate for several months. His intentions were laudable\n as he desperately wanted to protect Second Amendment rights and cut\n unconstitutional spending.\n \n Unfortunately, not one pro-gun senator chose to stand with Coburn...\n not one. In fact, GOA felt just as alone as Coburn did. While two\n veterans groups (and several pro-gun state groups) sided with us, GOA\n was the only pro-gun group at the federal level that actively fought\n this legislation week after week, while another and bigger\n organization was working behind the scenes to help pass the Veterans\n Disarmament Act.\n \n Standing alone, Senator Coburn decided to negotiate for a better\n bill. GOA was asked for input and made a few contributions to the\n bill, but not enough to justify support for the Veterans Disarmament\n Act.\n \n Add to this fact that GOA was prevented from seeing the final version\n of the bill before the brokered Schumer-Coburn compromise was taken\n to the floor under a Unanimous Consent agreement.\n \n As a result, Senator Coburn spoke in favor of the compromise bill on\n the floor of the Senate -- something that was a huge mistake, for\n many of the glaring problems with the bill still remained untouched.\n \n So chalk up a victory for Chuck Schumer... and for Carolyn McCarthy\n as well, as she told CBS News, \"This is the best Christmas present I\n could ever receive.\"\n \n \n WHAT DOES THE BILL DO IN GENERAL?\n \n It would be a mistake to under-react -- or over-react -- to the\n passage of the Veterans Disarmament Act. On the bad side, this bill\n statutorily validates BATF regulations which could potentially disarm\n millions of Americans. This is a VERY DANGEROUS turn of events which\n will have huge ramifications over the next several decades.\n \n The extent to which its unconstitutional potential will be realized\n will be clear only over time -- and perhaps a long time -- and will\n depend on whether pro-gunners or anti-gunners are in power. For\n example, it took a full thirty years for language in the 1968 Gun\n Control Act to be used to disarm veterans.\n \n On the other hand, GOA was able to secure a few modest concessions\n which should provide some protection to gun owners -- though NOT\n NEARLY ENOUGH PROTECTION TO JUSTIFY SUPPORT of this bill.\n \n So having said that, what are the implications of this legislation\n for Americans with psychiatric diagnoses?\n \n Although we succeeded in forcing the deletion of the ratification of\n the BATF regulations, per se, section 101 (c) (1) (C) contains new\n language which could make you a \"prohibited person\" (unable\n to own a\n gun) based solely on a medical finding (by a psychiatrist or\n psychologist), provided:\n \n * That you had \"an opportunity for a hearing by a court, board,\n commission or other lawful authority\"; and\n \n * In the future, that you had notice that you would be made a\n \"prohibited person\" as a result of the agency action (section\n 101 (c)\n (3)). [NOTE: This was added pursuant to negotiations over GOA's\n objections to the bill.]\n \n However, even these modest gains have severe limitations. Up to\n 140,000 veterans had their gun rights taken away as a result of a\n diagnosis of a mental disorder such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder\n (PTSD). But this new law does not require two important things for\n those 140,000 people:\n \n 1. The new law does not require that a veteran needed to have any\n knowledge of the ramifications of the \"diagnosis\" in the past\n -- and\n the fact that this diagnosis could disarm him or her for life. How\n many veterans suffering from PTSD simply went to Veterans Affairs,\n hoping to get treatment, but now face a lifetime gun ban because of\n the new law?\n \n 2. Also, the act does not require that the disarmed vets even knew\n they had a right to appeal their diagnosis. Many of the 140,000\n Americans who have now lost their Second Amendment rights first\n received a letter from Veterans Affairs telling them that, due to\n their diagnosis, a \"guardian\" was being appointed for them to\n handle\n their affairs. As stated above, how many vets realized that this\n action would deem them as \"mental defective\" under the 1968 Gun\n Control Act and strip them of their gun rights?\n \n Moreover, how many vets realized they could challenge this action by\n appealing the diagnosis? If they didn't realize the significance of\n this VA letter, most likely, the vets did nothing, as they were more\n concerned with getting the monetary benefits that such a diagnosis\n would bring. But, whether they knew these things or not, this new\n law would still validate the removal of their Second Amendment\n rights.\"\n \n \n Sounds pretty much like they were screwed,blued and tattooed.",

You are all dangerous! \n \n   Grandfathering Meaningless in McCarthy&#8217;s Ban \n We have the final language of the McCarthy Bill, as introduced in Congress. A key aspect to this proposed law, which I have not touched on before, is perhaps the most important aspect of it:\n \n (v)(1)(A)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), it shall be unlawful for a person to transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device.\n \n The law begins with the default presumption that it is illegal to possess a &#8220;large capacity ammunition feeding device.&#8221; That you possessed the magazine prior to the ban would be an affirmative defense to the charge in court that you possessed a magazine with 11 rounds or more. You could be arrested and charged for possessing one, and be forced to prove in court that you owned it prior to the ban. The original assault weapons ban contained this:\n \n (4) If a person charged with violating paragraph (1) asserts that paragraph (1) does not apply to such person because of paragraph (2) or (3), the Government shall have the burden of proof to show that such paragraph (1) applies to such person. The lack of a serial number as described in section 923(i) of title 18, United States Code, shall be a presumption that the large capacity ammunition feeding device is not subject to the prohibition of possession in paragraph (1)\n \n McCarthy&#8217;s bill contains no such exemption, which puts the burden on you to prove you fall under one of these two exemptions. Carolyn McCarthy has been on NPR saying that the things bloggers have been saying about her bill aren&#8217;t true. She knows damned well they are true, and so do the anti-gun groups. The purpose of this bill is to try to get more of us thrown in federal prison.\n \n ... By removing the original grandfathering and protections that were in the original 1994 ban, the effect is vastly different than what we lived under with that regime. ..... unless you have proof you possessed them prior, at the arbitrary discretion of the authorities.

I would have voted for him and I think he could have pulled enough votes to win. I hope he can be encouraged to run this time. I think he has a better shot than anybody else the republicans could find to run. Things have finally gotten bad enough that the American people are concerned about things like the federal deficit and what the folks at the federal reserve are doing, and what the consequences will be. \n \n America is in for a terrible time over the next several years. We will be lucky to come out the other side as a single nation. Paul is the guy we need leading us through this period.\n\n \n Are you talking about Ron Paul or his Tea Party Son?...\n \n Ron Paul did run as an independent. In fact I almost voted for him but He had no chance in reality so I did the old lesser of two evils and Voted Obama. Palin was the reason I also could not support McCain. Once he chose her I was sure he had lost his senses.\n \n Edit: I didn't know Ron Paul wasn't included, apparently he was only on some ballots but not his own doing. Mostly state agencies were having him added as a write in such as California, or other states where he was on the ballot under the \" constitution\" party. He was on the ballot here in my state though I don't remember if it was under independent or not.",

A lot of people encouraged him to run as an independent at that point, but he did not because he was afraid he would split the republican vote and hand the democrats a victory.\n \n Paul has the distinction of being the only presidential candidate every forcibly placed on a ballot. The Constitution Party of Montana removed their chosen candidate from the ballot and inserted Pauls name after he lost the republican nomination. He requested that his name be removed from the ballot and the Montana secretary of state refused. He also received more write in votes than any candidate in history, despite the fact that he actively discouraged the practice.",

He was on the ballot in a few other states as well such as here in my state but he wasn't the one putting his name on the ballots., I didn't know that. It's a shame too because If he could make a serious run I would vote Conservative for the first time. Hopefully he'll try again in 2012, although he really should be out building up steam early.",
