   "Okay, I am a Christian but I don't know where in the bible it says to go kill people in the name of the Prince Of Peace. Could someone tell me where it says Jesus wants me to go kill people for no reason other than in his name. Oh, and please give me a reference from a translation other than KJV. Any English translation other than that one.\n Why would God want the Christians to go kill people when it says in Leviticus, repeated by Jesus, and also referenced by Paul to Love Your Neighbor as yourself. In fact, the bible says that the most important commandments are 1) Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your strength (or mind) and\n 2) Love your neighbor as yourself.\n The people who kill in Jesus's name are either delusional or misinterpreting the Bible in the first place. But no human is perfect. I'm protestant and so a part of me says that the ones leading the Crusades were the leaders of the Catholic church who were basically messing with the people during that time anyway. Possibly the best thing to have come from the Crusades were texts of the Eastern world. I'm going to stop because I'm starting to go off onto a tangent.

   "Just a wee bit of evidence that the Roman Catholic Church hasn't done enough penance yet:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/13/international/europe/13ireland.html\n \n November 13, 2005\n Irish Report on Sexual Abuse by Priests Stokes Outrage \n By BRIAN LAVERY\n DUBLIN, Nov. 12 - An independent report on sexual abuse of children by Roman Catholic priests in Ireland has led some members of Parliament to call for a severing of the formal ties between the Irish government and the Roman Catholic Church and has led the justice minister to promise new child-protection laws and a nationwide audit of how the church handles such cases. \n \n The report, by a three-member panel appointed by the Irish government, showed that the Catholic Church hierarchy in Ireland was only one part of a system that enabled cover-ups allowing known sexual predators to retain their positions within the church - and their access to young victims. \n \n Before 1990, the panel found, the police were reluctant to investigate claims of sexual abuse by the clergy because they were fearful of challenging the privileged position of Roman Catholic Church authorities. \n \n Most schools in Ireland are run by the Catholic Church, so even lay teachers found it difficult to sound alarms. In addition, public health authorities failed to follow up on some accusations of abuse and cut short other inquiries. \n \n For nearly three years, the commission, led by a former Supreme Court judge, heard more than 100 accusations of abuse against 26 priests over a 40-year period in one diocese, Ferns, on Ireland's southeast coast. \n \n One-fifth of the report's 271 pages is taken up by testimony, often verbatim and frequently explicit, from the victims. It includes accounts of priests at a Catholic boarding school who measured boys' penises at night, of boys who were forced to perform oral sex on priests and of girls who were molested during confession, one even on a church altar.\n \n The sense of outrage that has simmered in Ireland since the late 1990's, when abuse cases began coming to light in the United States, here and elsewhere, has reached the boiling point with the release of the report. Newspaper headlines and angry pub conversations have referred to Ferns as \"the most evil diocese in the world\" and to abusive priests as \"the Devil's disciples.\" \n \n An investigation of 60 accusations of abuse in the Dublin archdiocese began this week, and a public debate has begun about whether to end the Catholic Church's role in the Irish education system. About 95 percent of Ireland's elementary schools are state-financed but run by Catholic authorities.\n \n Internationally, victims' support groups and campaigners for changes within the Catholic Church have hailed the Ferns report as a watershed in the history of the sexual abuse scandals. \n \n \"We at last now have a government coming out on the record against this institution,\" said Paul Baier, a director of Bishop Accountability, a nonprofit group based in Boston that documents cases of sexual abuse by priests. \"It is showing what a lot of us know, that this is a worldwide problem.\"\n \n The inquiry uncovered greater detail than six recent American grand jury investigations, said David Clohessy, director of Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, which is based in St. Louis. \n \n \"Tremendous secrecy is still the norm,\" Mr. Clohessy said. \"Any external peek into how it works is very rare and very valuable.\"\n \n Pope John Paul II, who was pope when many of the sexual abuse scandals became known, said in 2002 that he was \"deeply grieved by the fact that priests and religious have themselves caused such suffering and scandal among the young.\" \n \n His successor, Pope Benedict XVI, has given no response to the Ferns report, in keeping with Vatican policy of refusing to comment on specific cases.\n \n Few people in Ireland have been as instrumental in exposing the scale of the abuse as Colm O'Gorman, who said he was abused as a boy in Ferns by Sean Fortune, who became known as Ireland's most notorious pedophile priest. \n \n After Mr. Fortune committed suicide in 1999, while facing 66 criminal charges of sexually abusing boys, Mr. O'Gorman founded One in Four - the name refers to the concept that one in four people is a victim of sexual abuse - a counseling and support organization. Lobbying by Mr. O'Gorman's group was integral to setting up the Ferns inquiry.\n \n \"On a professional level, there is a real sense of relief,\" Mr. O'Gorman, 39, said in an interview after the report's release. \"Nobody will ever be able to say again, 'We didn't know.' Nobody will ever be able to say again, 'We didn't understand the implications,' or 'This is best left to the church.' \"\n \n (More)",

   "As in the United States, the Catholic Church in Ireland has financially compensated many victims of abuse to avoid legal proceedings, including Mr. O'Gorman's own settlement for $350,000 in 2003. At the time, an admission of church negligence was read by Bishop Eamonn Walsh into the Irish High Court record. Bishop Walsh, who was appointed to Ferns after the scandal broke, has publicly accepted the findings of the report and repeated his apology to victims.\n \n The Irish government's publications office has sold more than 3,000 copies of the report, and thousands more have been downloaded from that group's Web site, www.bishop-accountability.org. The government declined to publish the report online for fear that doing so could expose it to defamation lawsuits in other countries, including the United States.\n \n The report's harshest judgments were against Donal Herlihy, the former bishop of Ferns, who has since died, and his successor, Brendan Comiskey, who resigned in 2002 after the BBC broadcast a documentary about Mr. O'Gorman. \n \n The Ferns report also touched on the Vatican's demand for secrecy in sexual abuse cases - on pain of excommunication - and revealed how Bishops Herlihy and Comiskey repeatedly placed priests whom they knew to be pedophiles in positions that made it easy for them to abuse children.\n \n \"Bishop Herlihy's failure to take even basic precautions to protect children from men known to have abused in the past must be seen as inadequate and inappropriate,\" the report said. \"He does not appear to have recognized that the wrongdoing was a serious criminal offense. Neither he nor the medical and health care community appreciated the grave damage which child sexual abuse can cause to its victims.\"\n \n In the 1970's, Bishop Herlihy knew that two men studying in the local seminary had been accused of sexually abusing children, but still ordained them as priests. When additional accusations against them emerged, Bishop Herlihy sent the two for psychiatric treatment, then made the \"inexplicable\" decision to appoint them to curacies despite their \"manifest unsuitability,\" the report said. \n \n Bishop Comiskey continued similar practices, the report said, appointing known abusers to manage elementary schools as late as 2002.\n \n The report referred to the 15 priests it investigated by Greek letters, like \"Father Alpha,\" which left many victims feeling that the reckoning was incomplete. \"It has been very difficult for people whose abuser hasn't been named publicly,\" Mr. O'Gorman said.\n \n Even accusations against Greek letters are damaging to the Catholic Church, which is at the lowest point in its history in Ireland. For the first time, the Dublin archdiocese will not ordain any new priests this year. \n \n Gina Menzies, an Irish theologian and author, said she suspected that the government might next choose to investigate religious orders. \n \n \"This is only the tip of the iceberg,\" she said, referring to the report.",

He also told her to \"go and sin no more.\" It seems odd to expect Christians to have an anything-goes worldview, and not have moral disapproval of things they view as immoral that they see around them. \nI agree with that to an extent, but it is not addressing my point of the hypocritical way many Christian preachers rebuke, judge and condem the one and simply denounce the other.

We condemn the Muslim Imams because they do not condemn the radical so-called Muslims in a loud enough voice. The same is true now of Christianity. The Christian theologians and teachers do not condemn the radical so-called Christians with a loud enough voice - they don't condemn actions of their own congregation with a loud enough voice.\n \n \nAnd that's just as wrong as when those fundamentalist Christians make generalizations about, say, gay people. And again, there is a big difference between supporting things like bombing abortion clinics and having a moral belief that abortion is wrong. \nThe question is why does the \"moral belief\" that abortion is wrong or the gay lifestyle is wrong, lead preachers and church groups to rebuke, judge and condemn gay men and women with so much more self-righteous indignation and rage than is expressed when denouncing a group that commits or supports violence against abortion gays?\n \n \nIt's just not right to expect Christians to be the only ones in society to not form value judgements on actions they see around them.\nBut it is right to expect that the leaders of the Christian community preach the commandments of Jesus, not the hate and vitriol that has become associated with Christianity.",

   "There is little doubt about this. Religion's role is rarely if ever to be the true cause of aggression; it is far more likely to be the excuse, the ostensible cause, the proclaimed but not the real casus belli. Waging war for religious principle sounds so much more noble and justifiable than admitting you're just after the other side's goods and territory.\n \n But before we conclude that this exonerates christianity from any responsibility for the crusades, we need to examine just how willing were the church leaders of the day for their religion to be hijacked in this materialistic cause.

   "I guess somethings never change. If the Crusades were really for political reasons but preached to the people as \"Taking back the Holy Land from the Godless heathens (or something like that)\" by the leaders at the time, isn't that similar to today, when people blindly follow a leader into a war that doesn't have anything to do with anything? Bush lead America [astray] to Iraq to fight about something that didn't even exist. Then the country just blindly followed him into a mistake. There were multiple reasons said for going to war and a majority of the people believed that lier. So are we in a Crusades now?

   "Is more energy and money spent on denouncing the bombers of abortion clinics than is spent rebuking, judging and condemning homosexuals?\n\n \n Howard, again you are generalizing here. Let's be honest--you and I both know that fundamentalism does not make up that large of a percentage of Christendom. It just happens to be the loudest, as fumdamentalism often is. (But at least Christians fundies use the airwaves instead of body-strapped explaosives to get their condemnation across, but that's another debate.) Disapproval of gay relationships is not the same as condemnation. Disapproval of abortions is not the same as condemnation of people who have abortions. You are doing the very same things I talked about in my last post by lumping all this together. \n \n I don't disagree with you that Christians should denounce abortion clinic bombing more often. But I'm not going to get into a comparison game either, and start trying to see which one-ups the other. The problem I have with you view is that you seem to think ALL the fault lies squarely with Christians. And that's just not a rational position. The reality is that, yes, some Christians have given Christianity a bad name, but also society has not been very honest at times in noting that it's really some Christians doing these things and not all of them. Not even most of them. \n \n Christian hypocrisy is too often an excuse to say something spiteful about Christians. \n \n \nYou find a great many preachers who preach that gay men and women will burn in hell.\n\n \n Actually, no there aren't that many anymore. Not everyone is Fred Phelps. I was in conservative churches for many years, and I never heard a single sermon saying that gays will go to hell. I never even heard a sermon about gays, period. \n \n \nI don't think that you saying that you have never heard a preacher say that aids is a punishment from God on the gay community?\n\n \n I most certainly can say it. I heard awhile back that Pat Robertson had said it once, but I'm not a Pat Robertson fan--a lot of what he says isn't true.\n \n \nHave you never heard a preacher say that the World trade Center bombings are God&#8217;s punishment of New York because the Gay lifestyle is accepted and a woman has the right to chose? \n\n \n Nope. Another PatRobertsonism I believe.\n \n \n . . . and a woman will burn in hell if she has an abortion? \n\n \n No, I haven't, but I'm starting to wonder what sort of church you've been in. It sounds like much of your view of Christianity is colored by extreme fundamentalism. \n \n \nHave you heard preachers voices raised with such intensity and such money behind them and on such a regular basis when it comes to violence against women, or child abuse, or incest or violence against gays? \n\n \n Yep. I've heard some powerful sermons on protecting children, women, orphans, the homeless, etc. I've seen more than one banquet hall full of people commit monetarily to help stop such horrible things.\n \n \nNo, what they are saying is that coming from the Christian community (as it exists today) it is the pot calling the kettle black. We have lost our moral authority, ceded the moral high ground as it were, to duplicitous preachers and hypocritical self-righteousness.\n\n \n It's impossible for the church to lose it's moral Authority. The problem I have with your view is that it's misplaced. If you really want to see such preachers stopped and quieted, then I would think you would direct your condemnation at them and not everyone else. Take it to the source.\n \n \nI know it is a human shortcoming, but we should strive to &#8220;Judge not&#8230;&#8221; our preachers should preach about the &#8220;beam in our own eye&#8221;.\n\n \n Jesus didn't mean we can't form moral opinions. You are again muddying the waters between moral opinions and condemnation. I'd agree with you that condemnation is bad. But you are preaching about judgementalism, toward people that form moral views. Those are 2 different things.\n \n \nThe perception is not that it is &#8220;some Christians&#8221;, the perception is (and it is not unfounded) that no one vigorously denounces those whose preaching are anti-Christian.\n\n \n Then it's a wrong perception that's not true. I hear people denounce them all the time. I've denounced them a number of times myself in these forums (such as my comments on Pat Robertson lying and Fred Phelps) and I've seen others who are Christian do it too. At some point we have to admit that we can only do so much to get people to not be anti-Christian. Some people are going to always see hypocrisy even when it's not even there. The fault also lies with some people who have a real and irrational prejudice against Christians. \n \n I think what you're really getting at (but perhaps don't quite know how to say) is that people in the evagelical movement don't always denounce fundies enough, and that's probably true. But there are several large denominations that do, such as episcopalians. I go to a non-denominational church myself, but we can't stand fundies when it comes to social issues. I don't let my kids listen to American Family Radio even though it seems like it's everywhere around here, because all they talk about is how bad gay people are instead of more important issues such as the fact there are milions of people in poverty in the world. So you see, I agree with you in large part . . . I just don't think your generalizations are healthy and accurate. If you want people to get a better impression of Christianity, then take the time to show them the good things about it rather than engaging in the same sort of condemnation that fundies do.",

No one but me has seen the new History Channel show on this? Or is that Christians wish their brutal past were swept under the rug, as if it never happened?\n\n \n Simply a blanket statement about \"the Christian savagery of the Crusades.\" No real depth or breadth there. No attention to the pre-history of the Crusades which is significant. No mention that the 1st Crusade was called in part because the Fatimid caliph of Egypt destroyed the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and ordered the destruction of all Christian churches. No mention that the Muslim army had been aggressively attacking Christian lands for hundreds of years. No mention that the Christian lands of Syria, Iraq, the Byzantine Empire, and even as far as Spain and France had been attacked by Muslims. No mention that Islam had its origins in conversion by conquering with Mohammed. Christians had to respond.\n \n Look at this timeline if you have any doubts about the aggressive military endeavors of Islam. The attack on Christian lands by Muslims 400 years prior to the 1st Crusade wasn't the only event.

It is impossible to say the Bracha and not consider whether a prayer against wickedness includes yourself, because each of us, far from perfect, has some wickedness in us. Therefore the modification of the Bracha to destroy wickedness but not the wicked is self-serving and reminds us to ask for G-D's help in removing the evil from ourselves as well as from our enemies. Is it not possible for a person to be their own enemy? Only in the extreme do we want wickedness overcome by destruction of the person himself, whether that person is another or ourselves.\n \n",

Well, there's really no such thing as today's Christianity, there are Christianities. ...\n\n \n Well what do you know...one or more reasons to \"bash\" Christians just popped in my local paper.\n \n \nLetters to the Editor, Thursday, November 24, 2005\n \n Offended\n \n I will express my sentiments on Wal-Mart removing its greeting of \"Merry Christmas\" and replacing it with \"Happy Holidays.\"\n \n I feel we Christians are too apathetic in matters we should be deeply concerned with.\n \n My family does not plan to spend any money with them this Christmas and I think if enough people would do the same, they will have a new approach next year.\n \n They say they do not want to offend anyone, yet I feel offended by their choice.\n \n We have been celebrating Christmas for more than 200 years on Dec. 25.\n \n If others want to celebrate other holidays, they should choose another date for that. If they are offended by our celebration of Christmas, they can go back to their homeland and celebrate to their heart's desire!\n I believe having Bill O'Reilly on their case will make a huge negative impact on their sales.\n \n Dick Barr\n Dothan\n \n\n \n I've written a response letter to the editor, but don't know if it will get printed because I live in the buckle of the Bible belt.\n \n \nIn his Nov. 24 letter about WalMart's switching to 'Happy Holidays', Dick Barr makes several ridiculous comments. He says, \"We have been celebrating Christmas for more than 200 years on Dec. 25. If others want to celebrate other holidays, they should choose another date for that\". First, Jesus was not born on Dec. 25, so what exactly are the Christians celebrating on \"Christ's birthday\"? Second, the Christians effectively stole Dec. 25 from the pagans, who had already been celebrating that date for hundreds of years. Third, Jews - who do not recognize Jesus as the Christ - have been celebrating Hanukkah in December for more than 2000 years.\n \n Mr. Barr says he is offended by the change, but is he so insensitive to other people's feelings that he's incapable of seeing how Muslims, Jews, and Hindus that live here could be offended by the splashing of Christ-mas all over the place? Would Dick happily accept WalMart's putting up banners celebrating the major Muslim, Jewish, and Hindu holy days throughout the year? Why should the Christian religion get special treatment in a country that purports equal rights to, and equal treatment of, all people regardless of their religion? \n \n Mr. Barr goes on to say, \"If they are offended by our celebration of Christmas, they can go back to their homeland and celebrate at their heart's desire!\". Perhaps Dick doesn't realize that the Constitution - the actual founding document of our nation - is a secular document and makes no references to Jesus, Christ, or God (and the only two references to religion are exclusionary, stipulating what the government cannot do). This is not a Christian nation, and all religions are equally welcome. So where do Christians get off telling others to leave? What makes Christians think this is their home, only?\n",

A fragment from the Arch of Titus, Rome.Jerusalem became the birthplace of Christianity in the first century CE. According to the Bible it is the location of both the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n \n After a brief period of Roman rule, the city was ruined when a civil war, accompanied by the Great Jewish Revolt against Rome in Judea, led to the city's sack yet again, at the hands of Titus in 70 CE. The Second Temple was burnt and all that remained was a portion of an external (retaining) wall that became known as the Western Wall.\n \n After the end of this first revolt, Jews continued to live in Jerusalem in significant numbers, and were allowed to practice their religion. In the second century, the Roman Emperor Hadrian began to rebuild Jerusalem as a pagan city while restricting some Jewish practices. Angry at this affront, the Judeans again revolted, led by Simon Bar Kokhba. Hadrian responded with overwhelming force, putting down the revolution, killing as many as a half million Jews, and resettling the city as a pagan polis under the name Aelia Capitolina. Jews were forbidden to enter the city but for a single day of the year, Tisha B'Av, (the Ninth of Av, see Hebrew calendar), when they could weep for the destruction of their city at the Temple's only remaining wall.\n \n For the next 150 years, the city remained a relatively unimportant Roman town.

   "@ Bradante\n \n I don`t think you understand my question. Are you trying to justify the barbarity of the christian crusaders, do you think that the frankish knights acted in self-defence or do you think that Pope Urban called the crusades in order to pretect the Roman catholic church from future enemies?\n \n As for your description of history, I must say that I don`t think your description of the historic events and circumstances is very accurate. Grouping together various independant civilisations and kingdoms as merely \"christian\" and \"muslim\" is terribly simplistic and makes your description of the events sorely lacking. Individual kingdoms, peoples, tribes and empires warred with eachother, regardless of religion and faith. \n \n The Byzantine Empire was the remains of the large Roman empire. As the Roman empire crumbled to Germanic invasions, the Byzantine Empire held on to its territories. But the empire had many enemies. Huns, Bulgars, Slavs and Avars (mongols) all raided the Byzantine Empire as well as conquered land and territory, but none of them managed to break Constantinople itself. The Sassanid Empire and The Byzantine empire waged numerous wars without either of them coming out on top. \n \n After the various Arab tribes had managed to unite under Muhammed and expanded their civilization beyond the deserts of the arabic peninsula, both the Byzantine Empire and the Sassanid Empire where exhausted from fighting eachother. The Arabs conquered the eastern parts of the Greek-Byzantine Empire as well as it`s territories in North Africa. The Sassanid Empire was completly destroyed and conquered by the Arabs. With them, the arabs brought Islam, allthough due to the religous tolerance (or disinterest) of the Arabs, no attempts to unite the religion of the conquered peoples where made by force. By 750 AD, the Arabs had established an empire that spaned from Spain in the west, to the border of modern-day India. \n \n In 755, the Arabic empire started to fall apart. The province of Cordoba (modern day Spain) broke away from the Caliphate and was established as an independant kingdom. As did modern-day Egypt and formed an independent caliphate of the Fatimids. In 1055, Seljuk Turks from Turkestan in Central Asia surged westward and fell upon both the Abbasid caliphate as well as the Byzantine Empire. The Greek armies where defeated, as where the armies of the Abbasid caliphate. Baghdad was conquered and the Abbasid caliphe was made a puppet to the new Seljuk Turk masters.\n \n At the end of the 11th century, the Turks managed to conquer Jerusalem from the Muslim rulers, something that led to the exclamation of outrage that the city was \"in the hands of unbelievers\" from the papacy. Nevermind that the city had been in the hands of Muslims since the 9th century...\n \n So, the Arabs, that had conquered the middle east from the Greece-Byzantine empire in the 7th century where not the ones threatening the Byzantine empire in the 11-12th centuries. And as always, the people living of the land and in the cities where the one that faced the brutality of the crusaders so the idea that one could justify the barbarity and evil of the crusades based on events and acts that took place 400 years prior and involving different actors (both individually and in regards of civilisations) is just morally reprehensible. The idea that the Frankish knights acted to protect \"christendom\" as in protecting the Byzantine Empire is baseless. Heck, even Constantinopel, the capital of the supposed ally of the Frankish knights was sacked and put to the torch. The idea that the Frankish knights acted in self-defence for themselves or the Roman catholic church is also ludicrous. The Frankish kingdom was never threatened by the Seljuk Turks, nor was the Roman church. The \"muslim\" kingdoms and peoples where fighting eachother and all the gains for the Seljuk Turks was made at the expense of the Abasidd caliphate. \n \n So, I ask again, what is your point? If you are looking for justifications, there are none. If you are looking for exlpanations, look at the events in Europe and how the Roman Catholic church was embroiled in the worldly affairs of various kings and emperors.",

Are you trying to justify the barbarity of the christian crusaders, do you think that the frankish knights acted in self-defence or do you think that Pope Urban called the crusades in order to pretect the Roman catholic church from future enemies?\n ....... \n\n \n The answer is \"yes\". Pope Urban II gave the crusaders two goals: 1. Rescue the Christians in the East 2. liberate Jerusalem and the other places made holy by the life of Christ.\n \n\n Pope Urban II called upon the knights of Christendom to push back the conquests of Islam at the Council of Clermont in 1095. \n http://www.crisismagazine.com/april2002/cover.htm \n\n \n I suggest that anyone interested in the truth read the above reference. There are lots of misconceptions about the Crusades and the Crusaders, but what is known for certainty is that they were generally wealthy men who undertook the task of regaining the Holy Lands, not for profit, but as penitance for their sins.\n \n \n\n So, I ask again, what is your point? If you are looking for justifications, there are none. If you are looking for exlpanations, look at the events in Europe and how the Roman Catholic church was embroiled in the worldly affairs of various kings and emperors.\n\n \n Islam, from its very inception, relied on war to expand its position in the world. From the 7th Century to the 11th, Islam grew by conquest. As this conquest grew closer to Europe and engulfed the Holy Lands, Europeans began to take note. The early Crusades slowed the spread of Islam, but it didn't stop it. Throughout the 14, 15 and 16th centuries, Muslims became more powerful. When the Ottomans gained control of the Muslim world, it turned its efforts towards Europe. In 1529, the Turks laid seige to Vienna. They were already at Europe's doorstep. The Holy League 1571-73, between Pope Pius, Spain and Venice defeated the Ottomann fleet at Lepanto.\n (An interesting sidenote: even back in the 16th Century, France was making secret alliances with Europe's enemies from the East).\n It was these Holy Leagues that kept the Turks out of Europe until Europe became so wealthy that they no longer had to fear Turkish invasions.\n \n As a politician once quipped \" History will be kind to me for I intend to write it.\"\n The Crusades were about stemming the spread of Islam. Were there acts of barbarianism along the way? You bet. On both sides. There were mass slaughters of men, women and kids, beheadings, rapes, etc., perpetuated by Christians in the name of God and Muslims in the name of Allah.

   "That's deconstructionism at its most dumb.\n \n It's an attempt to deny any meaning to the word \"Islam\" because one can't define what it is.\nHere is a website that lists over 70 Islamic sects.

I have not read, so therefore cannot agree or disagree with their version of Islam or their translations of the Qur'an.\n \n http://www.real-islam.org/73_8.htm\n \n Other sources say that there are over 150.

They are not representative of all Moslems, and therefore there might in fact be a different number. Thus I apply your deconstruction argument against your evidence.\n \n\n Other sources say that there are over 150. So my \"dumb\" &#8220;deconstructionism&#8221; may be more accurate than you realize. Also, I&#8217;d appreciate it if you would tone down the invectives.\n \n As far as \"defining\" the word Islam, why not tell me what you think the word &#8220;Islam&#8221; means.\n\n Again here you are simply applying a particular argument when it suits you.\n \n Further to that, the fact that they recognise them all as Islamic, means that the term 'Islam' has a meaning; in that they all conform to it. Thus you still defeat yourself with your deconstruction non-sense... by citing an site that recognises all of them as Islamic; it's akin to arguing that there's 'x' ammount of cells in the body, and someone else argues there's 'y', and regardless, they're ALL cells of the body. Even if the cells are diversified. There is still commonality enough for them all to be grouped under the label 'cells of the body'.\n \n Thanks for trying to introduce some evidence, though. No wonder it's not been forthcoming because it leads to the laughable situation of you citing evidence is that it argues against you.\n \n You've cited a site that proclaims...\n \"So it becomes quite clear that there is no doubt about the authenticity of this hadith and great scholars of Islam like al-Baghdadi regarded this hadith to be an authentic one.\"\n http://www.real-islam.org/73_2.htm\n \n Thus when I mention about Aisha's age, you've now cited a site that agrees with me over the accuracy of the evidence I stated. Thanks again for arguing against yourself. It also suggests that there's a commonality of ideas here too, so your cite argues against you on two different subjects: Aisha's age, and a definition of belief in Islam! emoticon_xclown\n \n Whilst I'm on this, although it's of that other thread...\n Hadith accepted by Sunni Islam\n \n The Sunni canon of hadith took its final form four to five centuries after the death of Muhammad. Later scholars may have debated the authenticity of particular hadith but the authority of the canon as a whole was not questioned. This canon includes:\n al-Bukhari (d. 870) included 7275 hadiths\n Muslim b. al-Hajjaj (d. 875) included 9200.\n Abu Da'ud (d. 888)\n al-Tirmidhi (d. 892)\n al-Nasa'i (d. 915)\n Ibn Maja (d. 886).\n \n al-Bukhari and Muslim are usually considered the most reliable of these collections. There is some debate over whether the sixth member of this canon should be Ibn Maja or the Muwatta of Imam Malik, which is the earliest hadith canon but predates much of the methodology developed by the classic hadith scholars.\n \n Adherents of some contemporary Sunni movements, both Salafis and liberals, tend to base their arguments solely upon al-Bukhari and Muslim, and disregard all the weaker collections, as well as the four legal schools (madhhab) based in part upon these collections. More traditional Muslims accept the legal schools and value all the collections.\n Hadith accepted by Sunni Islam\n \n The Sunni canon of hadith took its final form four to five centuries after the death of Muhammad.

   "Given this assumption about Islam I asked you why did they launch a war against the Roman Empire. They did this. They did this at a time when the Roman Empire was fighting another war with the Persian/Parthian area.\n \n SO, if Islam only advocated defensive wars, what made them attack the Roman Empire.\n \n\n \n You didn't get it.... just because Muslims started a war deosn't mean they were following the techings of Islam. Just as the crusaders weren't following the teaching of christianity.\n \n Awful condicending for someone who just had a major point go right over their head.\n \n \nIt means struggle. I've already noted this. Struggle can be by war, which I also noted.\n\n \n Jihad is not, EVER war. Anyone who thinks it is or can be has a profound misunderstanding of the Islamic teachings.\n \n \nI agree up to a point. Islam does teach that EVERYONE must submit to Islam. In fact, Islam translates to \"submission\".\n\n \n The bible says the exact same thing, and Islam really means surrender, as in surrender to god.",
