   "Of all of the millions of words posted on here debating Christianity, the truth of it, the fallacy of it, here is a simple test for both believers and non-believers. A simple test for those REALLY wanting to know , whether they are ever going to understand the message of Christ, or if HE ever existed at all. ...\n \n If they will sit quietly and listen to the singer Leann Rhimes sing AMAZING GRACE acappella, and if a tear does not come to their eyes while listening to her, they need to go and.....\n \n Sell their bible to the local used book store. Stop posting their INTELLECTUAL reasonings on BBS boards, because they do not have in them  what it takes to comprehend the Words of Christ. THAT, being a human spirit. ",

   "Well, I found that a 280 piece marching band did a quite wonderful job on Amazing Grace. The crowd that had continued to chatter and chatter through the preformances of other bands was stunned to silence, and some had tears in their eyes. The band director muted the brass sections at one point by having them execute some complicated wheels that turned them 180 degrees from the stands. Being brass, they were still audible, but as soft harmony for the clarinets, saxes, and flutes. In the finalle, the brass had moved to a position where another massive wheel formed an inverted chevron facing the stands and marching slowly straight forward, with more than 20 trombones right in the middle surrounded by the other brass. Even the judges froze and stopped taking notes.\n \n Both of my sons played trombone in that band and neither understood the power to their performance. When they finished the director had the biggest smile on his face that you can imagine. The band received top marks. But I still don't see what that has to do with anything more than an laughable and unfounded reference to Christ.\n \n Some music can be very moving. No question. I have found that many performances of \"Oh, Danny Boy\" have almost brought me to tears. I guess that means that the Irish must be favorites of Christ, even though he never mentioned them. Or what about \"Imposible Dream\" from \"The Man of La Mancha?\" That one gets me every time. So explain to me how that is related to Jesus.",

The test results are based on ones ability to be moved from the gentleness of the words and the deep meaning the song presents. If one is not moved by that song, especially when sang acappella by Leann, they have some cement in their soul. I stand by that statement...\n \n I think we all know here you are a devout Christian and are very well versed in the doctrines. So no one can really \"offend\" your faith, it stands on its own merit. In my simpleton little \"test\" I was trying to make a point that unless one has the soft heart, open mind , and human \"spirit\" to recieve the Word, ALL of the text, links, etc, expressed by the intellects on here, will never be comprehensible to those , seaching for the truth. ...\n \n I think you know what I am saying, but when one is out on the defensive limb here all the time, a believer finds themselves stuck in that mode of thinking, and reacts that way instinctively.
