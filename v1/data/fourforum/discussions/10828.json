   "I've asked this on an evolution vs creationist forum and got no play, so here it is:\n \n Creationists often attack uniformitarianism, yet seem to have no problems using it in their own claims for the age of the Earth. Yet when attacking uniformitarianism, they claim that a different set of physics existed prior to the entry of the current laws of physics yet can provide no good reasoning or evidence for this.\n \n My question is, how can you determine the age of the Earth when your belief operates on the premise of two different sets of laws of physics, one of which cannot be determined in the way it functions? And are the dates given by creationists who DO use uniformitarianism essentially hypocritical?",

All we science folks ask is read, read, read the science behind the conclusion and go off the beaten path to get answers.

In science you make your observations, tabulate your data, and see if you can come up with an equation that fits the data. That's how Newton got F=ma, for example. Creationists are sorta doing the same thing, but instead of basing their \"observations\" on the universe, they're taking them out of the Bible. They then try to come up with equations that fit their Biblically derived age for the universe of 6000 years, or whatever is in vouge at the moment. Of course no equation will explain modern observations and give you an age of 6000 years for the universe, so they have to say that the laws of the universe were changed during the flood or resurection or something.",
