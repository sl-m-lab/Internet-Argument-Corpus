   " So atheists! No matter how you feel about Religions now, sooner or later you will believe ;) and for all those other kids who read this...that does not mean you can go out and do whatever and think that there will be no consequences...you will pay for the sins you commit but in the end you will all be saved.\n\n \n The Bible doesn't teach that. They must repent and receive Christ as their Lord and Savior for the remission of their sins.\n \n &#8220;Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.\" - John 3:36\n \n &#8220;I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am the one I claim to be, you will indeed die in your sins.\" - John 8:24\n \n &#8220;Jesus answered, \"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.&#8221; - John 14:6\n \n &#8220;But unless you repent, you too will all perish.&#8221; - Luke 13:3\n \n Jesus on Hell\n \n From Luke 16 - The Rich Man and Lazarus: \n \n 19 \"There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day. 20 At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores 21and longing to eat what fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores. \n \n 22 \"The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried. 23 In hell, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. 24 So he called to him, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.' \n \n 25 \"But Abraham replied, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. 26 And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.' \n \n 27 \"He answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father's house, 28 for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.' \n \n 29 \"Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.' \n \n 30 \"'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.' \n \n 31 \"He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.' \"\n \n In Matthew 13:42, Jesus says: \"And shall cast them into a FURNACE OF FIRE: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\"\n \n In Matthew 25:41, Jesus says: \"Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting FIRE. . .\"\n \n Jesus Christ says in Mark 9:43-47, \n \n 43 And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:\n 45 And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:\n 47 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:\n \n WHAT JESUS CHRIST SAYS ABOUT HELL! \"fire\" Matt 7:19, 13:40, 25:41 \"everlasting fire\" Matt 18:8, 25:41 \"eternal damnation\" Mark 3:29 \"hell fire\" Matt 5:22, 18:9, Mark 9:47 \"damnation\" Matt 23:14, Mark 12:40, Luke 20:47 \"damnation of hell\" Matt 23:33 \"resurrection of damnation\" John 5:29 \"furnace of fire\" Matt 13:42, 50 \"the fire that never shall be quenched\" Mark 9:43, 45 \"the fire is not quenched\" Mark 9:44, 46, 48 \"Where their worm dieth not\" Mark 9:44, 46, 48 \"wailing and gnashing of teeth\" Matt 13:42, 50 \"weeping and gnashing of teeth\" Matt 8:12, 22:13, 25:30 \"torments\" Luke 16:23 \"tormented in this flame\" Luke 16:24 \"place of torment\" Luke 16:28 \"outer darkness\" Matt 8:12, 22:13 \"everlasting punishment\" Matt 25:46\n \n Jesus Christ gave a solemn warning in Matthew 7:21-23\n \n \"Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven. . . MANY will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.\" \n \n Jesus also said, \"Do not fear those who can kill the body, but fear Him who can kill the body and soul in hell.\"\n \n Watch \"23 Minutes in Hell\" Video - Bill Wiese\n \n 23 Minutes in HELL, by Bill Wiese, he explains the torments of what Hell is like\n \n Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God - A Great Awakening Revival Sermon\n \n Select Sermons | Christian Classics Ethereal Library\n \n Atheists repent!

   "For all of those who send that they will not be saved I only have one verse to show you.\n \n Rom.3:23: \"For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God\"\n \n If this is true then none of us diserve salvation. Yes, it is true that us Christians repent so that we may be saved but admit it. I know you have not repented for every sin in your entire life. If this is true then wouldn't you believe that we should all be going to hell?\n \n Let's put it this way. Sins are like building blocks. As time passes you stack more and more up until you have a wall. Repenting is one way of ridding yourself of that wall...somewhat. No matter who we are we cannot get rid of the whole thing. I believe that on our final day when we come to be judged is when we can make our final decision on whether or not we believe. As for us Christians our decision should be quite simple. But if you are an atheist and saw Heaven wouldn't you want to repent then. I do not believe it is ever too late to repent even after death. If they do not repent after seeing this then i do believe that they will burn for their transgressions...but I also believe HE will save them no matter when or where they are at the time they repent.",

Jesus taught, \"Forgive us our trespasses (sins) as we forgive those who trespassed against us.\" That and your regular prayers should cover it.\n \n There is a Hell, and Jesus said there would be a great deal of weeping and gnashing of teeth, etc. (see my previous post for all the particulars).",
