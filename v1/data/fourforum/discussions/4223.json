   "I'm starting a research paper for my Sociology class. The research is to understand, who becomes a Creationist, why, where your from etc. Your help is most appreciated.\n \n Please give basic background:\n Age, State of residence, Marital status, Education Level, Religious Affiliation, Occupation.\n \n What type of Creationist are you? Examples:\n \n Flat Earthers - believe that the earth is flat and is covered by a solid dome or firmament. Waters above the firmament were the source of Noah's flood. This belief is based on a literal reading of the Bible, such as references to the \"four corners of the earth\" and the \"circle of the earth.\" Few people hold this extreme view, but some do.\n \n Geocentrism - accept a spherical earth but deny that the sun is the center of the solar system or that the earth moves. As with flat-earth views, the water of Noah's flood came from above a solid firmament. The basis for their belief is a literal reading of the Bible. \"It is not an interpretation at all, it is what the words say.\" (Willis 2000) Both flat-earthers and geocentrists reflect the cosmological views of ancient Hebrews. Geocentrism is not common today, but one geocentrist (Tom Willis) was intrumental in revising the Kansas elementary school curriculum to remove references to evolution, earth history, and science methodology.\n \n Young Earth Creationists - claim a literal interpretation of the Bible as a basis for their beliefs. They believe that the earth is 6000 to 10,000 years old, that all life was created in six literal days, that death and decay came as a result of Adam & Eve's Fall, and that geology must be interpreted in terms of Noah's Flood. However, they accept a spherical earth and heliocentric solar system. \n \n Old-Earth Creationists - accept the evidence for an ancient earth but still believe that life was specially created by God, and they still base their beliefs on the Bible. There are a few different ways of accomodating their religion with science.\n \n Day-age creationists - interpret each day of creation as a long period of time, even thousands or millions of years. They see a parallel between the order of events presented in Genesis 1 and the order accepted by mainstream science. Day-Age Creationism was more popular than Gap Creationism in the 19th and and early 20th centuries.\n \n Evolutionary Creationism - differs from Theistic Evolution only in its theology, not in its science. It says that God operates not in the gaps, but that nature has no existence independent of His will. It allows interpretations consistent with both a literal Genesis and objective science, allowing, for example, that the events of creation occurred, but not in time as we know it, and that Adam was not the first biological human but the first spiritually aware one.\n \n Theistic Evolution - says that God creates through evolution. Theistic Evolutionists vary in beliefs about how much God intervenes in the process. It accepts most or all of modern science, but it invokes God for some things outside the realm of science, such as the creation of the human soul. This position is promoted by the Pope and taught at mainline Protestant seminaries.\n \n Materialistic Evolution - differs from Theistic Evolution in saying that God does not actively interfere with evolution. It is not necessarily atheistic, though; many Materialistic Evolutionists believe that God created evolution, for example. Materialistic evolution may be divided into methodological and philosophical materialism. Methodological materialism limits itself to describing the natural world with natural causes; it says nothing at all about the supernatural, neither affirming nor denying its existence or its role in life.\n \n Philosophical materialism - says that the supernatural does not exist. It says that not only is evolution a natural process, but so is everything else.\n \n Vedic Creationism\n Hinduism speaks of a very ancient earth. One book influenced by Hindu belief argues that anatomically modern humans have existed for billions of years.\n \n Finally, What brought you to believe what you believe?\n \n Your help is most appreciated.",

I grew up attending several different churches ranging from baptist, nazarene, apostolic, pentacostal, and Assembly of God. I've chosen the Assembly of God doctrine which fits as close to my views as possible. I'm also a caddy at a private golf course. Although I've lived 18 years, I've been way more than any 18 year old should have to go through. One thing is that I could never deny the existence of God. I've studied and studied hoping to prove their is no God with a clear conscience, and didn't come remotely close. I've been to some of the most beautiful spots on earth and can't deny God's creative majesty. \n \n If you are open minded and have a brain get a hold of Dr. Kent Hovind's DvD collection. His website is www.drdino.com. It will convince you, and show how time and time again evolutionist have twisted and manipulated evidence into their favor. \n \n I believe that the earth was created literally in 6 days. I believe the earth was flooded by the barrier of water that encompassed the earth....the flat earth thing is new to me....no where have I heard the earth is flat.....the 4 winds and corners I guess...anyway I believe that God single handedly created all before us.

So you seem to be having some difficulty in deciding which religion is actually correct. Perhaps none is, since all that you mention are relatively recent inventions of men.\n \n Mr. Kent Hovind is scientifically illiterate and just counts on duping the uneducated. With just a little effort it is possible to learn that Mr. Hovind proposes pseudoscience. Even Answers in Genesis has criticized the points that you find so convincing. I suspect that you too, are scientifically illiterate and lack the knowledge to dicern where he is feeding you a line of crud.\n \n Really, it's not hard to figure out if you have the integrity to look for the real facts. If Hovind is correct, then every scientist in the world, even the Christians, are menbers of a vast conspiracy to deceive you. The very idea is simple minded. Hopefully you will grow up some day.",

Maybe you haven't heard of some of those creationists because if they state what they believe in public the tend to be greeted with gales of laughter. But they do exist. For example, recently when the Kansas Board of Education wanted the science standards gutted of all references to evolution and an old earth, they turned to a Missouri flat earther to do the job for them. His views weren't made generally public because I suspect that not even the creationists on the Board of Education would buy his brand of crazy.\n \nIf you are, heres something to help you, you ask why creationist belive in what the believe? Maybe theyve been brainwashed to believe in the creation theory, although none would admit it.\n\n Well, there isn't any such thing as \"creation theory,\" just as there is no such thing as \"creation science.\" In creationism there is no effort to test or to explain. They are, indeed, brainwashed. They prefer to believe that the mythology of bronze age, nomatic herdsmen is historically accurate and to ignore the evidence in the world around them.",

   "Philosophical materialism - says that the supernatural does not exist. It says that not only is evolution a natural process, but so is everything else.\n \n \n that would be me, 21, PA, College Student, single, and atheist.\n \n As for the secondary topic that seems to be developing as to the proof as to whether God exists or not. I will submit Kierkegaard's argument here, which seeks to show why the whole debate is silly and meaningless:\n \n \nwhat is this unknown something with which the Reason collides when inspired by its paradoxical passion, with the result of unsettling even man's knowledge of himself? It is the Unknown. It is not a human being, in so far as we know what man is; nor is it any other known thing. So let us call this unknown something: the God. It is nothing more than a name we assign to it. The idea of demonstrating that this unknown something (the God) exists, could scarcely suggest itself to the Reason. For if the God does not exist it would of course be impossible to prove it; and if he does exist it would be folly to attempt it. For at the very outset, in beginning my proof, I would have presupposed it, not as doubtful but as certain (a presupposition is never doubtful, for the very reason that it is a presupposition), since otherwise I would not begin, readily understanding that the whole would be impossible if he did not exist. But if when I speak of proving the God's existence I mean that I propose to prove that the Unknown, which exists, is the God, then I express myself unfortunately. For in that case I do not prove anything, least of all an existence, but merely develop the content of a conception. Generally speaking, it is a difficult matter to prove that anything exists; and what is still worse for the intrepid souls who undertake the venture, the difficulty is such that fame scarcely awaits those who concern themselves with it. The entire demonstration always turns into something very different and becomes an additional development of the consequences that flow from my having assumed that the object in question exists. Thus I always reason from existence, not toward existence, whether I move in the sphere of palpable sensible fact or in the realm of thought. I do not for example prove that a stone exists, but that some existing thing is a stone. The procedure in a court of justice does not prove that a criminal exists, but that the accused, whose existence is given, is a criminal. Whether we call existence an accessorium or the eternal prius, it is never subject to demonstration. Let us take ample time for consideration. We have no such reason for haste as have those who from concern for themselves or for the God or for some other thing, must make haste to get existence demonstrated. Under such circumstances there may indeed be need for haste, especially if the prover sincerely seeks to appreciate the danger that he himself, or the thing in question, may be non-existent unless the proof is finished and does not surreptitiously entertain the thought that it exists whether he succeeds in proving it or not.\n \n \n If it were proposed to prove Napoleon's existence from Napoleon's deeds, would it not be a most curious proceeding? His existence does indeed explain his deeds, but the deeds do not prove his existence, unless I have already understood the word \"his\" so as thereby to have assumed his existence. But Napoleon is only an individual, and in so far there exists no absolute relationship between him and his deeds; some other person might have performed the same deeds. Perhaps this is the reason why I cannot pass from the deeds to existence. If I call these deeds the deeds of Napoleon the proof becomes superfluous, since I have already named him; if I ignore this, I can never prove from the deeds that they are Napoleon's, but only in a purely ideal manner that such deeds are the deeds of a great general, and so forth. But between the God and his works there is an absolute relationship; God is not a name but a concept. Is this perhaps the reason that his essentia involvit existentiam ?2 The works of God are such that only the God can perform them. Just so, but where then are the works of the God? The works from which I would deduce his existence are not directly and immediately given. The wisdom in nature, the goodness, the wisdom in the governance of the world -- are all these manifest, perhaps, upon the very face of things? Are we not here confronted with the most terrible temptations to doubt, and is it not impossible finally to dispose of all these doubts? But from such an order of things I will surely not attempt to prove God's existence; and even if I began I would never finish, and would in addition have to live constantly in suspense, lest something so terrible should suddenly happen that my bit of proof would be demolished. From what works then do I propose to derive the proof? From the works as apprehended through an ideal interpretation, i.e., such as they do not immediately reveal themselves. But in that case it is not from the works that I make the proof; I merely develop the ideality I have presupposed, and because of my confidence in this I make so bold as to defy all objections, even those that have not yet been made. In beginning my proof I presuppose the ideal interpretation, and also that I will be successful in carrying it through; but what else is this but to presuppose that the God exists, so that I really begin by virtue of confidence in him?\n \n \n \n *I have submitted this lengthy argument because it is far more eloquent then I could ever be on the subject.",
