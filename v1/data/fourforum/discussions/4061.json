   "Dono, better get your uniforms out of mothballs and prepare for travel. The Pentagon is requesting that Rummy establish new reserve military service parameters including 24-months of active duty terms with no limitation on the number of those terms. Theoretically, you could do a 24, go home for a month and go back again, home, back again until no longer needed or dead. Pay and benefits are way up there, if that's any consolation for being shot at. \n \n http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=542&e=4&u=/ap/20050107/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/reserves",

An expansion of the war on terror deception, such as Syria, would make expansion a public no-brainier but possibly be the beginning of the end of administration support for aggressive foreign policy, as they well know. Maybe the next move is $100k starting salaries and doctorate degree guarantees to maintain the illusion of a volunteer military. \n \n I did read National Guard recruitment was down 30% for the last half of 2004. We're now seeing interviews in our local paper of personal hardships being experienced by active guard families, including money drives to help save homes, so maybe potential enlistees are taking a closer look at the difference between defense and political aggression. \n \n Sorry Dono, reservists have no option of avoiding enlistment.",

With their predictions that our troops would be met with flowers and cheers turning into essentially a running gun battle with a popular insurgency and bothe their WMDs and the ties to Bin Laden (who they stopped just short of claiming was Saddams gay lover) both turning out to be either intelligence failures of an absolutly epic scale, or downright lies told by ment who were so anxious to get out there and blow some stuff up that they just couldn't restrain themselves, I can't imagine they would have much left by way of ego.\n \n Of course, maybe that is what it takes to be president anymore, the ability to live in an absolutly delusional state. It certainly seems like that is one of the requirements to be a modern republican.\n \n \nI did read National Guard recruitment was down 30% for the last half of 2004. We're now seeing interviews in our local paper of personal hardships being experienced by active guard families, including money drives to help save homes, so maybe potential enlistees are taking a closer look at the difference between defense and political aggression. \n \n \n We are seeing the same thing around here. There was even an interesting article in the local rag the otehr day about the fact that the \"education\" provided by the military is very nearly useless, and the tedhnical training they provide is absolutly useless in the real world due to the propreitary nature of our military technology and the maintenance/repair policies used by our military. They highlighted an example of a young man who got out 2 years ago. He was an aircraft mechanic, and went to work in the private sector working on Jets. The first time he replaced a $300,000 engine due to a cracked turbine (the urbine for the same engine was less than $30,000.00) he was unceremoniously sacked. HE had no idea how to replace a turbine. The military apparently doesn't generally do such things. They replace the whole engine. \n \n Of course, this is just a local paper. Their advertising revenue comes from places like Guins showcase (the local furniture store) and Bluestem Farm and Ranch, places that are not likely to pull their advertising in retalitation for the local media painting their (the advertisers) bought poltiicians in an unflattering light.",
