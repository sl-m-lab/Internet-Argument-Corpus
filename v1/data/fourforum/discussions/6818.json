   "Individual thinking not being acceptable to many belief systems, which would raise the question of which dictatorships.\n To your point... \nThere are many \"ways of knowing,\" but the religious historian Karen Armstrong, in her recent study of religious fundamentalism, \"The Battle for God,\" identified two primary systems that have special relevance for the current conflict [the war on terror]. One she called \"mythos.\" With its roots in ancient times when gods, heroes and other fanciful forces provided the answers for the questions of existence, mythos relies on intuition, superstition, emotion, tradition--on non-rational ways of knowing. You could call it a form of art. \n \n The other system is \"logos.\" As the name implies, logos relies on reason and logic, on what we call rational ways of knowing. You could call it a form of science. \n \n Our new war is a battle between mythos and logos. \n \n Osama bin Laden, the Taliban and their Muslim fundamentalist allies live within mythos and have subordinated themselves to it. They see themselves not as individuals with wants and needs, which is a relatively modern notion, but as operatives of Allah. For them, everything is religion, everything faith. In fact, they don't acknowledge any other legitimate way to look at the world. They are essentially premodern and ahistorical, believing only in what has been passed down to them by Allah; in the madrasas, the Muslim religious schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan, students are strictly forbidden from learning anything except the Koran, that is, anything except mythos. When zealots talk about bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age, it is futile not only because the Taliban are already there physically but because they are also there epistemologically. \n http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0302/gabler011102.asp",

   "Another good article, by a former evangelical preacher:\n \n \nFundamentalist Christianity: A Dangerous Force When it Denies Rational, Scientific Thinking\n \n Religious leaders hate rival sources of authority. 18th Century European Enlightenment thinking with its concepts of rationalism and science provided religious authoritarianism with that rival. America's founding fathers, products of the Enlightenment, had the audacity to effectively say to Christianity, \"worship all you want, but our Constitution does not need your influence!\" Roman Catholic traditionalists and Protestant Christian bible-based fundamentalists still seethe over this rejection...\n \n (snip) \n \n Fundamentalism's anti-science attitude pervades society. The science journal Physical Review reported in May 2004 that scientific papers published by west European authors exceeded those by U.S. authors in 2003. In 1983, there were three American authors for every one west European. \n \n The percentage of patents granted to American scientists has been falling since 1980, from 60.2 percent of the world's total to 51.8 percent. \n \n In 1989, America trained the same number of science and engineering PhDs as Britain, Germany and France combined. In 2004, the United States is five percent behind. European scientists now outnumber American scientists in citations awarded.\n \n America is behind in cloning and stem cell research, now led by South Korean, Italian and British scientists. American fundamentalists seek to outlaw stem cell research on the arbitrary and totally unproven premise that \"life begins at conception,\" a recent concept contrary to the teaching of St. Augustine and the allegedly infallible Roman papacy for some 1,500 years.\n \n Fundamentalists use religious pretexts against scientific and cultural objections. A religious sounding \"bumper sticker\"-like rationality is usually sufficient to corral the pliant followers. Fundamentalism's dictates on issues are arbitrary and cleverly manipulated to appeal to the emotions of voters. Whether the issue is evolution, gay marriage, stem cell research, abortion, euthanasia or the environment, the strategy is the same.\n \n President Bush's recent endorsement of teaching \"Intelligent Design\" perpetuates this same denial of science. ID proponents have never had an article on ID published in any peer-reviewed scientific journal. They do not conduct experiments that would prove or falsify their hypothesis. Their religious conjecture under the guise of science makes no useful predictions, nor can they model it mathematically. There are no research labs doing ID science because \"Intelligent design\" is not science, it is religion!\n \n \"Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it\" is a profound quote by philosopher George Santayana. We used to be fearful that Communism might bring America down. History and current trends show the fruit of Christian fundamentalism. It is a far more insidious enemy seducing its gullible adherents with idle threats and false promises. Religious fundamentalists' objectives have never changed; they seek vindication for their rejection and want America's obeisance. Under George Bush, it looks like history is repeating itself. They will gladly lead our nation down fundamentalism's proven path of destruction, all in the name of their God!\n http://www.dissidentvoice.org/Aug05/Salisbury0812.htm",

   "Fundamentalists: 'Bulls in the china shop of rational human beings'\n \n (excerpt)\n \n Tom Ehrich, an Episcopalian minister who writes for Religion News Service, explored Christian and Muslim fundamentalism in a recent commentary. Through the continual learning of Islamic fundamentalism, Ehrich says Christians are presented with a mirror image of fundamentalists in their own faith, especially in regard to how both view the Quran and the Bible and their constant attempts to bring government and society into compliance with their interpretation of those books.\n \n Ehrich writes that both Christian and Islamic fundamentalism are built on the same pillars: \"...a book, a worldview shaped and bound by that book, a distrust of reality that doesn't fit within the book, a desire to have the book answer all questions, preferably for all people, and a hostile attitude, verging on contempt, for others.\"\n \n If the holy books, which are perfectly admirable in their own rights, are taken too far, Ehrich says they \"draw (people) deep within fearful confines where modernity is feared, other-ness is feared, knowledge is feared and diversity is feared.\" \n http://www.txbc.org/2002Journals/April2002/Apr02FundamentalistsBulls.htm",

   "...Conservative pundit Stanley Kurtz claims to have found the \"proof\" that the institution will see its demise: Gay marriage helped to kill heterosexual marriage in Scandinavia. Indeed, Kurtz has become a key figure in the marriage debate: He and his statistics have been taken up by conservatives to support their argument that gay unions threaten heterosexual marriage. He has shown up in Congressional hearings, lawsuit filings, newspapers, debates, and anti-gay marriage videos across the country. \n \n But Kurtz's smoking gun is really just smoke and mirrors. Reports of the death of marriage in Scandinavia are greatly exaggerated; giving gay couples the right to wed did not lead to massive matrimonial flight by heterosexuals. \n \n Currently there are nine European countries that give marital rights to gay couples. In Scandinavia, Denmark (1989), Norway (1993), Sweden (1994), and Iceland (1996) pioneered a separate-and-not-quite-equal status for same-sex couples called \"registered partnership.\" (When they register, same-sex couples receive most of the financial and legal rights of marriage, other than the right to marry in a state church and the right to adopt children.) Since 2001, the Netherlands and Belgium have opened marriage to same-sex couples. \n \n Despite what Kurtz might say, the apocalypse has not yet arrived. In fact, the numbers show that heterosexual marriage looks pretty healthy in Scandinavia, where same-sex couples have had rights the longest. In Denmark, for example, the marriage rate had been declining for a half-century but turned around in the early 1980s. After the 1989 passage of the registered-partner law, the marriage rate continued to climb; Danish heterosexual marriage rates are now the highest they've been since the early 1970's. And the most recent marriage rates in Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are all higher than the rates for the years before the partner laws were passed. Furthermore, in the 1990s, divorce rates in Scandinavia remained basically unchanged. \n \n Of course, the good news about marriage rates is bad news for Kurtz's sky-is-falling argument. So, Kurtz instead focuses on the increasing tendency in Europe for couples to have children out of wedlock. Gay marriage, he argues, is a wedge that is prying marriage and parenthood apart. \n \n The main evidence Kurtz points to is the increase in cohabitation rates among unmarried heterosexual couples and the increase in births to unmarried mothers. Roughly half of all children in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark are now born to unmarried parents. In Denmark, the number of cohabiting couples with children rose by 25 percent in the 1990s. From these statistics Kurtz concludes that \" ... married parenthood has become a minority phenomenon,\" and-surprise-he blames gay marriage. \n \n But Kurtz's interpretation of the statistics is incorrect. Parenthood within marriage is still the norm-most cohabitating couples marry after they start having children. In Sweden, for instance, 70 percent of cohabiters wed after their first child is born. Indeed, in Scandinavia the majority of families with children are headed by married parents. In Denmark and Norway, roughly four out of five couples with children were married in 2003. In the Netherlands, a bit south of Scandinavia, 90 percent of heterosexual couples with kids are married. \n \n Kurtz is also mistaken in maintaining that gay unions are to blame for changes in heterosexual marriage patterns. In truth, the shift occurred in the opposite direction: Changes in heterosexual marriage made the recognition of gay couples more likely. In my own recent study conducted in the Netherlands, I found that the nine countries with partnership laws had higher rates of unmarried cohabitation than other European and North American countries before passage of the partner-registration laws. In other words, high cohabitation rates came first, gay partnership laws followed.\n \n A subtler version of Kurtz's argument states that the advent of registered partnership caused an increase in cohabitation rates and children born outside of marriage (nonmarital births). If that were true, then we would expect to see two patterns: Cohabitation rates and the nonmarital birth rate would rise more quickly within a country after it passed partner registration laws; and the rise in the nonmarital birth rate would be greater in countries that had such laws than in countries that do not recognize same-sex partnerships.\n \n Kurtz's argument fails both tests. From 1970 to 1980, the Danish nonmarital birth rate tripled, from 11 percent to 33 percent. Over the next 10 years, it rose again to 46 percent and then stopped rising in 1990s after the passage of the 1989 partnership law. Norway's big surge occurred in the 1980's, with an increase from 16 percent to 39 percent. In the decade after Norway recognized same-sex couples (in 1993), the nonmarital birth rate first rose slightly, then, after a couple of years, leveled off at 50 percent. \n \n Cohabitation rates tell a similar story. In Denmark, from 1980 to 1989, the number of unmarried, cohabiting couples with children rose by 70 percent, but the same figure rose by only 28 percent from 1989 to 2000-the decade after Denmark introduced its partner-registration laws-and then stopped rising. From 2000 to 2004, the number has increased by a barely perceptible 0.3 percent. The fact that rates of cohabitation and nonmarital births either slowed down or completely stopped rising after the passage of partnership laws shows that the laws had no effect on heterosexual behavior.\n \n Furthermore, the change in nonmarital births was exactly the same in countries with partnership laws as it was in countries without. The eight countries that recognized registered partners at some point in the decade from 1989 to 2000 saw an increase in the average nonmarital birth rate from 36 percent in 1991 to 44 percent in 2000, an eight percentage point increase. Among the EU countries that didn't recognize partners (plus Switzerland), the average rate of nonmarital births rose from 15 percent to 23 percent-also an eight-point increase. \n \n No matter how you slice the demographic data, rates of nonmarital births and cohabitation do not increase as a result of the passage of laws that give same-sex partners the right to registered partnership. To put it simply: Giving gay couples rights does not inexplicably cause heterosexuals to flee marriage, as Kurtz would have us believe. Looking at the long-term statistical trends, it seems clear that the changes in heterosexuals' marriage and parenting decisions would have occurred anyway, even in the absence of gay marriage.\n \n And all the conservative hand-wringing seems especially unnecessary when you consider the various incentives that encourage American heterosexual couples to marry. By marrying, U.S. couples obtain health-insurance coverage, pensions, and Social Security survivor benefits. Plus, in the United States we are required by law to be financially responsible for our spouses in bad times, since we don't have Scandinavian-style welfare programs to fall back on. \n \n In addition, American society already wrestles with the social tensions that Kurtz claims have occurred as a result of gay marriage in Scandinavia: deepening divisions over gay issues in churches, the increasing acceptance of lesbian and gay relationships in the media, and the occasional radical voice arguing for the abolition of marriage. Yet heterosexual couples keep getting married-more than 2 million of them every year.\n \n Concerns about the impact of gay marriage on heterosexual behavior are not unique to the United States, of course. European countries that recognize same-sex couples initially had their worriers, too. Over time, however, it became clear that civilization and family life would survive the recognition of gay couples' rights. Even the conservative governments that came into power have not tried to repeal rights for gay couples in France and the Netherlands. \n \n Both demographic data and common sense show that the dire predictions of Dobson and Kurtz are just cultural prenuptial jitters. Now that gay and lesbian couples are marrying in Massachusetts, we'll have a home-grown social experiment that will undoubtedly compare to that of Europe: Letting gay couples say \"I do\" does not lead to heterosexuals saying \"I don't.\" \nhttp://www.slate.com/id/2100884/",

   "Are Gays Wrecking Marriage in Scandinavia?\n \n ...There's one major problem at the outset for Kurtz's argument. There is not one gay marriage in any country he cites. In 1989, Denmark adopted a registered partnership law that granted most of the benefits and obligations of marriage to same-sex couples, with the notable exception of adoption rights. Norway adopted a similar law in 1993, and Sweden expanded its cohabitation law along the same lines in 1994. (Not until 2001 did a European country - the Netherlands - recognize gay marriages that are legally identical to traditional heterosexual marriages.) Thus, Kurtz blames \"gay marriage\" for worsening a host of social ills that were already present before it existed anywhere in the world.\n \n Second, even if these Scandinavian gay partnerships could be called \"marriages,\" Kurtz shows only a correlation between them and marital decline. For example, after Kurtz notes that marital problems are highest in European countries where gay \"marriage\" has a foothold, and lowest where it does not, he writes: \"This suggests that gay marriage is both a cause and effect of the increasing separation between marriage and parenthood.\" But this is a correlation; it does not show causation.\n \n There are also correlations between marital decline and non-gay marriage phenomena, like rising women's equality (in employment and elsewhere); no-fault divorce; rising incomes and prosperity; a generous welfare state that serves a caretaker role; longer life and better health; contraception; abortion; less religiosity, and so on. Any of these is a more likely culprit than gay marriage.\n \n Does Kurtz conclude we should return women to barefoot-and-pregnant legal status, ban divorce, tamp down on incomes, lower the quality of medical care, ban the use of contraceptives, and erase the distinction between church and state? All of these things would probably have a positive effect on marriage rates, divorce rates, and illegitimacy - but at very high and unacceptable cost to people like him. Yet Kurtz wants to ban gay marriages, which would have negligible or no effect on the pre-existing problems with marriage, at very high cost to the lives of gay people.\n \n In an effort to demonstrate gays really don't want marriage, Kurtz notes that only 2,372 gay couples had registered after nine years of the Danish cohabitation law, only 674 after four years in Norway, and only 749 after four years in Sweden. Notice that these are tiny numbers in countries of 5.1 million, 4.2 million, and 8.5 million people, respectively, in the 1990s. They seriously undercut Kurtz's claim that registered partnerships are destroying marriage in those countries. To reach his conclusion, Kurtz must assume a huge effect (marital decline) from a tiny cause (gay \"marriages\"). \n \n Even if Kurtz could demonstrate that these Scandinavian gay partnerships have somehow contributed to the erosion of marriage as an institution, he only reaches a conclusion long ago pressed by gay conservatives. It is the opposition to gay marriage that has led to the proliferation of alternatives to marriage itself. These alternatives serve to knock marriage off its pedestal as the gold standard for relationships, something feminist and libertarian critics of marriage might applaud, but traditionalist defenders of marriage should abhor.\n \n Traditionalists like Kurtz rightly worry about the rise in out-of-wedlock births in Europe and America. Notably, registered partnerships in Scandinavia restrict or forbid adoptions or artificial insemination by gay couples. That is, these partnerships encourage the separation of wedlock from parenthood.\n \n Full-fledged gay marriages would not encourage that separation; they would encourage the opposite. In two respects, gay marriage would result in _fewer_ children being raised by single or cohabiting parents. First, there are about 150,000 gay couples in the U.S. right now raising children. Yet these couples cannot marry. Current law guarantees these children will be raised in unmarried households. Second, most gay parents get their children from prior heterosexual marriages or relationships that many of them entered because of the pressures created by anti-gay social stigma. To the extent gay marriage increases social acceptance, and provides models of married gay couples, we should expect these people to be channeled earlier into gay relationships and away from doomed heterosexual relationships that produce children.\n \n Most telling, perhaps, is Kurtz's apparent resistance to changing no-fault divorce laws. Of all the legal changes to marriage over the past 40 years, no-fault divorce has had the greatest impact on the institution. Next to it, gay marriage as a legal reform is trivial. This shows, I think, that Kurtz isn't really serious about defending marriage. Like the many doomsayers before him, his goal is to keep gays down.\n http://www.indegayforum.org/authors/carpenter/carpenter40.html",

   "\"The first legal gay wedding ceremonies in the Netherlands took place on April 1, 2001. By November 2002, however, gay-marriage enthusiasts were forced to admit that interest in this new institution was fading. Since April 2001, each quarter has brought a further decline in the number of gay marriages, falling from 2,500 in 2001 to less than 1,500 last year. As of April 2004, only 5,916 of Holland's roughly 55,000 gay couples had tied the knot. The floodgates had been forced open by gay-marriage activists, but through them came just a trickle of mainly lesbian couples (lesbians make up only 20 percent of the homosexual community in the Netherlands, but they now make up more than half of all married homosexual couples). \n \n It seems that so far 90 percent of Dutch homosexual couples have declined the historic opportunity to get married. This already far-from-impressive statistic gets even worse when we take into account the fact that cohabiting gays and lesbians are actually just a small minority within the larger homosexual community. Gay organizations' own figures, which put the size of the gay community in Holland at around 1.5 million (almost 10 percent of the total Dutch population of 16 million), seem a wild exaggeration. But if accurate these figures would give the impression that with only a little bit more than one-third of 1 percent of Dutch gays and lesbians actually married, interest in marriage among homosexuals is virtually nonexistent. \n \n A government-sponsored study on sexuality in the Netherlands among people ages 18 and older came up with a more realistic figure of 350,000 gays and lesbians. Even on this cautious estimate, however, married gays and lesbians comprise no more than 3.3 percent of the total number of adult homosexuals. By comparison, by the end of 2003, heterosexual married people made up 60 percent of the total Dutch population ages 18 and older (and 75 percent if the categories of widowed and divorced are included).\n \n Some would say this doesn't matter &#8212; that the minimal interest among homosexuals in getting married is itself another good reason for legalizing gay marriage. After all, if few homosexual couples get married, there's little chance of a Trojan Horse scenario whereby gay married couples could somehow work to undermine heterosexual marriage from within. The positive version of this argument is made by Andrew Sullivan in his so-called conservative case for gay marriage. He claims that allowing gays to marry would not only not undermine marriage, it would also help strengthen an institution under threat of countercultural erosion. It would do so, he says, not just by boosting marriage statistics, but more important by presenting marriage as something to be desired, a special status worth fighting for. \n \n If true, this would be an important argument in favor of legalizing gay marriage. Unfortunately for Sullivan (and the Netherlands), however, the Dutch experience has shown the exact opposite of what he predicts. The Trojan Horse scenario only existed in the minds of gay-marriage activists looking for a strawman to burn down. After all, no serious opponent of gay marriage has ever argued that the fact that my gay neighbor suddenly has the right to get married would make me, a heterosexual married man, want to file for divorce. But by lobbying so intensively for a change in the law, the gay-marriage campaign did contribute to a change in people's attitude toward marriage. And there is little doubt that it has been a change for the worse.\"\n http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/livestro200406290924.asp",

   "\"As the Netherlands' experiment in legalizing same-sex unions has illustrated, same-sex marriage in that country constituted one more step in a steady legal and social breakdown of the family. This is not to say that the data imply a causal relationship between the initiation of same-sex marriage and the breakdown of the family in the Netherlands. Rather, the redefinition of marriage furthered a general pattern of cultural and legal erosion of the institution. According to several Dutch social scientists, their fellow citizens \"increasingly regard marriage as no longer relevant\" because they have been persuaded that \"marriage is not connected to parenthood and that marriage and cohabitation are equally valid 'lifestyle choices...'\"[2] Marriage may be losing its place as the fundamental building block of social infrastructure in the Netherlands.\"\n \n . . . As a result of the Act of Opening Marriage to Same-Sex Couples (2001), a simple legal procedure now allows couples to transform a registered partnership into a marriage, or, vice versa, to change the status of their marriage to a registered partnership. This led further to the phenomenon of \"flash annulments\" or \"lightning divorces\" (flitsscheidingen). In a flash annulment, a couple mutually decides to downgrade their marriage to a registered partnership, which is then quickly followed by the termination of their registered partnership. This effectively circumvents the divorce procedure, which is, by definition, more lengthy and complex. Commentary on flash annulments describes the procedure as an unintended consequence of the legislation.[7] The number of heterosexual couples who availed themselves of this unforeseen measure was substantial. In 2002-the first full year of its availability-about four thousand married couples terminated their relationships this way.[8]\"\n \n http://www.heritage.org/Research/Family/wm577.cfm#_ftn2",

   "Since 1989, gay marriage has been a reality in Scandinavia. And in Scandinavia, just as is happening now in the U.S., many members of the religious right predicted 'terrible consequences' for the institution of marriage, and for society in general, as a result. \n \n Yet now, 15 years after the first of these countries (Denmark) legalized gay marriage in the form of registered partnerships, the results are in: not only has gay marriage worked flawlessly in Scandinavia, the institution of marriage may have benefited as a result. Indeed, we now see that the main \"consequences\" of allowing gays and lesbians to marry have been to create safety and security for same-sex couples who have chosen to live their lives together. \n \n Of course, the fact that gay marriage has been a positive force in Scandinavian society, and has been accepted by the public at large, is something that the right-wing in the U.S. doesn't want to hear, and refuses to believe. In a recent article in the Weekly Standard, right-wing academic Stanley Kurtz, associated with the conservative Hoover Institution, attempts to make the argument that gay marriage in Scandinavia has had a negative impact on marriage and a negative social impact in general. \n \n It borders on the ironic that Kurtz should choose to attack the social culture of the Scandinavian countries, which have the lowest poverty rates in the world, the highest education rates, and a greater level of equality for women than any other set of countries. Yet the fact that gay marriage in Scandinavia has been integrated and accepted into their cultures without a hitch has created a great deal of fear among members of the right in the U.S., who worry, with good reason, that such positive results will cast doubt upon their claims that allowing gays and lesbians to marry in this country will have a negative impact on the \"sanctity of marriage\".\n \n During my two years conducting research in Scandinavia, while on a Fulbright Fellowship, for the specific purpose of analyzing the impact that passage of gay marriage has had on these countries, it became clear to me that this legislation has had many positive effects, and no negative ones. Mr. Kurtz's study, conducted through reports and research he read, as compared to empirical research, is severely flawed. Nevertheless, it is worth analyzing the points he has attempted to make, in order to demonstrate how he has failed to understand the positive impact that gay marriage has had in Scandinavia.\n \n First, Mr. Kurtz confuses (either accidentally or purposefully) issues of cause and effect. His main strategy throughout his article is to suggest that continuing increases in the rates of domestic partnership is conclusive proof that gay marriage has had a negative impact on society. Certainly, it is true that, over the past several decades, many couples in Scandinavia have chosen to live their lives together without actually going to city hall or church and signing official marriage documents - thereby living together as what we would call 'domestic partners' - permanent partners without a marriage certificate. This trend began decades ago, starting in the 1960's, and has continued to grow (both in Scandinavia and all other western countries, including the U.S.).\n \n Why might this continuous growth be the case in Scandinavia? Research suggests that many Nordic couples don't feel that they need the approval of the state to certify the validity of their permanent relationships. For many Scandinavians, once they have chosen their life partner, moved in together, and made plans for a family, it isn't clear what positive impact a marriage certificate from the government would have on their relationship.\n \n What is important to note here is that in the Nordic countries, where religion does not play the role in politics that it does in other countries, tolerance and respect for people's choice of family structure is a key component of the culture. In Scandinavia, family laws are created to reflect the way that people actually choose to live their lives, and to provide support and protection for those family structures, such as choosing to live together as a permanent couple without getting a marriage license.\n \n This differs drastically from the United States, where family law has been often used to reflect the religious values of politicians in office (which may reflect the views of their constituent majority, as opposed to their constituent minority), and as a punitive force to enforce the personal values of this group. That is, U.S. family law is often written in such a way to reward those who choose to create a family structure that is in line with the personal values of those in office, and to punish those who choose to create a family structure that such legislators personally disapprove of. (It is ironic to note that many American politicians, who in decades past attacked gay rights on the basis of the alleged promiscuity of gay men, now attack gay rights for on the basis of gay couples' desire to make a permanent and legally enforceable commitment to one another.)\n \n How is such a punitive family law structure enforced in the U.S.? By attaching a great number of benefits, financial and otherwise, to the marriage certificate. Those who receive a marriage certificate in the U.S. are 'rewarded' with a great number of government benefits, such as tax benefits, social security benefits, immigration benefits (for a foreign partner), health insurance and corporate benefits, and hundreds of other legal benefits. Those who do not, or cannot, marry their partner are punished by being denied such benefits, even if their tax dollars are used to pay for such benefits to other couples who can marry.\n http://www.freedomtomarry.org/document.asp?doc_id=1443",

Government posts would be reserved for the righteous, as long as they are male. There would be thousands of executions a year, with stoning a preferred method because it would turn the deaths into \"community projects,\" as movement theologian North has noted. Sinners in line for the death penalty would include women who commit adultery or lie about their virginity, blasphemers, witches, children who strike their parents, and gay men (lesbians, however, would be spared because no specific reference to them can be found in the Books of Moses). DeMar told me that among Reconstructionists he is considered something of a liberal, because he'd execute gays only if they were caught indulging in sodomy. \"I'm happy to just drive them back into the closet,\" he said. \n \n In introducing Moore at the Trinity Chapel rally, DeMar told the crowd that he supports a \"jurisdictional separation of church and state.\" But he was not mounting a defense of the First Amendment so much as outlining an organizational distinction. In his book Liberty at Risk, DeMar writes that \"the State cannot be neutral towards the Christian faith. Any obstacle that would jeopardize the preaching of the Word of God...must be opposed by civil government.\" \n \n Besides facilitating evangelism, Reconstructionists believe, government should largely be limited to building and maintaining roads, enforcing land-use contracts, and ensuring just weights and measures. Unions would not exist, and neither would unemployment benefits, Social Security, and environmental protection laws. Public schools would disappear; one of the movement's great successes has been promoting homeschooling programs and publishing texts used by tens of thousands of homeschooling families. And, perhaps most importantly, the state is \"God's minister,\" as DeMar puts it in Liberty at Risk, \"taking vengeance out on those who do evil.\" A major task for the government key Reconstructionists envision is fielding armies for conquest in the name of Jesus. \n",

Let's go back your original quote:\n \n \nI have yet to meet a single Christian, nor have I heard of one, that wants an America where no other religions can exist. If you know of any Christian in the public light or otherwise that has said that, I'd like to know who. Since there are definitely \"those out there\" that do (according to your post), I'm sure you'll have no problem naming some.\n\n \n It seems I may have a blind spot for the word \"leader\". Can you please point it out to me in the above post?\n \n \n You know, most people realise that when they resort to childish namecalling, it really makes them look petty and immature, but apparently you don't. Maybe you should head back to the schoolyard playground--recess is probably about over.\n\n \n Maybe I resort to childish name-calling because your arguments, as well as your silly attempts to dismiss everyone else's refutations of your arguments, are quite infantile. I will take you seriously the moment you make a serious argument.",

   "Also Known as: Smoke Screen, Wild Goose Chase. \n \n Description of Red Herring\n A Red Herring is a fallacy in which an irrelevant topic is presented in order to divert attention from the original issue. The basic idea is to \"win\" an argument by leading attention away from the argument and to another topic. This sort of \"reasoning\" has the following form: \n Topic A is under discussion. \n Topic B is introduced under the guise of being relevant to topic A (when topic B is actually not relevant to topic A). \n Topic A is abandoned. \n This sort of \"reasoning\" is fallacious because merely changing the topic of discussion hardly counts as an argument against a claim. \n http://search.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/red-herring.html",

   "http://www.religioustolerance.org/reconstr.htm \nIts most common form, Dominionism, represents one of the most extreme forms of Fundamentalist Christianity thought. Its followers, called Dominionists, are attempting to peacefully convert the laws of United States so that they match those of the Hebrew Scriptures. They intend to achieve this by using the freedom of religion in the US to train a generation of children in private Christian religious schools. Later, their graduates will be charged with the responsibility of creating a new Bible-based political, religious and social order. One of the first tasks of this order will be to eliminate religious choice and freedom. Their eventual goal is to achieve the \"Kingdom of God\" in which much of the world is converted to Christianity. They feel that the power of God's word will bring about this conversion. No armed force or insurrection will be needed; in fact, they believe that there will be little opposition to their plan. People will willingly accept it. All that needs to be done is to properly explain it to them.\n \n All religious organizations, congregations etc. other than strictly Fundamentalist Christianity would be suppressed. Nonconforming Evangelical, main line and liberal Christian religious institutions would no longer be allowed to hold services, organize, proselytize, etc. Society would revert to the laws and punishments of the Hebrew Scriptures. Any person who advocated or practiced other religious beliefs outside of their home would be tried for idolatry and executed. Blasphemy, adultery and homosexual behavior would be criminalized; those found guilty would also be executed.\n\n \n Is the baby happy now? Jeesh...",
