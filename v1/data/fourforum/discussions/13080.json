   "Galileo-\n \n How many times do I have to kick the everloving #### out of you before you quit acting stupid?\n \n We've gone over this a billion times before, and I'm getting tired of having to constantly repeat myself and my associates. Gun trace data isn't the same thing as crime guns being traced. Just because a gun in California was traced to having come from Utah, that doesn't mean it was bought by a gun trafficker and run back for the purpose of an illegal sale.\n \n People buy guns every single day of the year. People move every single day of the year, and when they move they take their guns with them. Guns are traced for any reason: it was turned in because somebody found it on the side of the road, it was recovered from a house fire, the owner died and the spouse didn't care to own it, it was found during cleanup of a natural disaster, it was reported stolen by the owner and later recovered from a criminal, etc.\n \n Everytime I beat the tar out of you and your friends and point out serious facts the undermine your argument, you always pop back with \"correlation isn't causation\". Well just because guns in California, New York, New Jersey and Washington DC weren't bought in the state, that's no evidence that gun runners really are buying up handguns in bulk from neighboring states and then trafficking them back across state lines. Nobody's denying that this does happen, but it's not the serious problem you make it out to be.\n \n Out of state guns coming into a state like New York isn't the fault of states with less restrictive laws. It's the fault of New York for setting up market demand for such.",
