   "An intelligent question:\n \nBARTON: Dr Chu, I don't want to leave you out. You're our scientist. I have one simple question for you in the last six seconds. How did all the oil and gas get to Alaska and under the Arctic Ocean?\n \n CHU: (Laughs) This is a complicated story, but oil and gas is the result of hundreds of millions of years of geology and in that time also the plates have moved around. And so, it's a combination of where the sources of the oil and gas...\n \n BARTON: Isn't it obvious that at one time it was a lot warmer in Alaska and on the North Pole? It wasn't a big pipeline that we've created from Texas and shipped it up there and put it under ground so we can now pump it up?\n \n CHU: No, there are continental plates that have been drifting around throughout the geological ages.\n \n BARTON: So it just drifted up there.\n \n CHU: Uh...That's certainly what happened. It's a result of things like that.\n \n\n Daily Kos: Joe Barton \"baffles\" a Nobel Prize-winning physicist\n \n And fails... But, Brainless Barton Brags on his Twitter:\n \nI seemed to have baffled the Energy Sec with basic question - Where does oil come from? Check out the video: YouTube - RepJoeBarton's Channel #tcot\n\n \n Jaysus Gawd!",
