   "Hello, vsaiyan. Your comment: \nBut its not scientifically proven and can never be proven, nor can Creationism. Both are accepted by belief alone.\n\n is inaccurate. Evolution has been scientifically proven, as much as anything can be proven in science, meaning that the evidence in favor of it is so overwhelming that it takes much effort to continue to deny its validity. It is not accepted by belief alone.\n \n I have posted this exact same post on other message boards; for the familiar names I see here, please forgive this repition. But so far only one creationist has ever tried to debate this point, and even that was more in the philosophy of science rather than the actual scientific merits.\n \n It turns out that the fossil record is excellent evidence in favor of evolution. This because not only are transitional fossils found, that is fossils that have \"in between\" characteristics that link later groups with earlier groups, but these transitionals usually have precise characteristics that were predicted by the theory of evolution even before their discover.\n \n The fossil record is full of transitional forms. We believe that species have evolved from previous species, and so we should see in the fossil record evidence of species that show evidence of having characteristics between modern species and previous species.\n \n This is exactly what we see. The most wonderfully complete record of evolution is that of human beings from an early bipedal ape. http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/images/hominids2.jpg\n In this graphic we have examples of skulls from purported human ancestors. Skull A is a modern chimpanzee - it is shown to demonstrate how Skull B, from an Austalopethicine, is very ape-like and definitely not human. Skull N is modern human. Note that the skulls in between show a very smooth transition between B to N, without any gaps. It is also true that the skulls are dated to the correct times. This is predicted by evolution.\n \n Kathleen Hunt has written a short article listing in detail transitional forms between different major groups of animals. In particle, there is a particularly detailed list of species showing the transition from reptiles to mammals. Note that these species, found as fossils, show the correct intermediate steps and are found in strata with the proper ages. It is interesting to note that we see the transformation of the reptilian jaw joint into the mammalian inner ear, which is something creationists always insisted was impossible.\n \n Fossils have also been discovered that give a nice series of transitionals between land mammals and modern whales.\n \n Another interesting website is the Palaeos site. It also contains some really cool cladograms. Start here at Sarcopterygii, the group of fish that include the ancestors of modern tetrapods (and so is the clade that contains tetropods). Scroll to the bottom of the cladogram and click on Reptilomorpha. Note if you scroll to the bottom there is Synapsida (although the link is actually in the box at the top of the page). At the bottom of this cladograms is the Mammalia (again, the actual link is in the box at the top). Scroll down. Congatulations: you have just gone through the entire evolutionary history of fish to modern mammals. Every name you saw on the cladogram represents an actual fossil species, carefully placed in the proper place in the cladogram based on age and a careful description of its morphology! Look at the really nice descriptions of the fossils; one of the best is a section on one of the proto-mammals, Morganucontidae. The descriptions show, I hope, that these phylogenic trees, and the claim that these fossils are transitionals, aren't arbitrary - they have exactly the right characteristics to be place where they are in the phylogenic trees, and they have the right \"in-betweenness\" to count as transitionals between two different groups of animals.\n \n So, in this respect, a prediction of evolution is born out in the fossil record. Can creationism explain these transitions, beyond simply saying that the creator simply created all these species because of whimsy? For instance, right now there is very little fossil evidence that link bats to their non-flying ancestors. My evolutionist prediction is that if and when these fossils are discovered, they will clearly link bats with more primitive tree dwelling mammals, distantly related to primates. No transitionl fossils will be found that are \"in-between\" bats and birds. What predictions can creationism make? Does belief a creator necessarily imply that such fossils will be found? If evolution predicts them, and creationism makes no predictions, what will it mean if and when such fossils are found?",

   "Ursus Maritimus:\n I hope that you don't mind me getting involved here. If so \"I will pack up my things and leave\". \n \n Assuming you are okay with me here; you quote:\n \nEvolution has been scientifically proven, as much as anything can be proven in science, meaning that the evidence in favor of it is so overwhelming that it takes much effort to continue to deny its validity. It is not accepted by belief alone.\n \n \n Evolution has not been scientifically proven, most of the evidence actaully goes away from evolution and towards creation. We will discuss this a little later. Evolution (like creation) does try to use science to justify its explanation or interpretation, but many things must be taken by faith for both theories to work. Firstly, creationists must take the existence of God by faith, although the design that we see hints towards a creator. Evolutionists must take it by faith that: there is no God, that life came from lifeless chemicals, and that the big bang happened. Science cannot verify any of the above listed events or things. Science deals with things in the present through observation, experimental validation and repeatability. Since both creation and evolution are both in the distant unobservable, unrepeatable past science is not well equiped to deal with them. This science is called historical science, and is really driven by philosophies, and personal belief systems. If you are an atheist, no matter how much evidence is displayed to you, you will never believe that there is a God. So by your belief systems evolution is true, because we are here and there is no God. \n \n Now let us point out one major flaw with evolution: that mutations plus natural selection does not equal evolution (an increase in the genetic information). This is very important as molecules to man evolution needs more new information that previously did not exist to come into the genome (DNA content of a species) for the species to evolve or change. Firstly we will use an example for natural selection, consider below:\n \n Consider that we have a whole population of people (people of varying height, some maybe tall, medium, short) living in an environment where there is a machine gun set to fire at a height of 160 cm at random intervals. Over time as the machine gun kept on firing, we would eventually get a new group of people that were on the average much shorter than 160 cm as the tall folks would die out. This can be illustrated by:\n Before the machine gun started firing; we would have the following sizes in the population:\n Tall people ( T T ) height < 180 cm.\n Medium people ( T t ) height: 160 cm < x < 180 cm. Or between 160-180 cm.\n Short people ( t t ) height <160 cm.\n \n Where T is the gene for tallness and t is the gene for shortness. So since we get two genes (one from each parent), tall would be T T while short would be t t and medium would be a mixture of T t. I hope that you understand that simple genetics.\n \n After the machine gun started firing; we would get the following sizes in the population:\n Short people ( t t ) height <160 cm.\n This is because everyone over the height of 160 cm would be shot by the machine gun and die. So the adaption to the environment would be by natural selection. So natural selection by itself results in a loss of information from a population; i.e. in this case the loss of the T genes, hence resulting in shortness.\n \n An example where both natural selection and mutations work together to enable a creature to survive also results in a loss of genetic information. Consider that flightless bird in the Galapagos Islands, oh, what is it's name? I think it is called something like the flightless conrade. Anyways, this bird does not have any feathers and as a result it can swin and dive quite well. It is important to note that this bird has a mutation that stops the bird from forming any feathers. As a result of this appearent advantage it left more off spring on the island and itsurvived while the other birds with feathers died out. The the adaption here is natural selection by mutation. The bird has lost  the ability to produce feathers, and natural selection eliminates  the birds with feathers, hence, losing  the gene  for the production of feathers.\n \n So to say that mutations + natural selection = evolution (GTE) is like saying that a merchant who has a discount of every product he sells but he thought that he could make up the difference on quantity. It just doesn't work like that.\n Mutations + natural selection = loss of information + loss of information\n = really big loss of information.\n \n This alone does not allow evolution to proceed. In a recent video produced by Answers in Genesis titled \"From a Frog to a Prince\" the presenter questions Dr Richard Dawkins (reknown evolutionist from England): \"Dr Dawkins, can you give us just one example of a mutation, or any other evolutionary process that has been seen to add information to the genome?\" Dr Dawkins answer was a shock, nearly 19 seconds of silence. When he finally responded the answer he gave did not answer the original question. The Australian Skeptics Association gave Dr Dawkins three whole pages in which to defend himself, and he still didn't answer the question. There is no doubt that Dr Richard Dawkins is still an evolutionist, one of the most powerful, so don't get the impression that he doubts evolution.\n \n You also talk about transitional forms:\n \nIt turns out that the fossil record is excellent evidence in favor of evolution. This because not only are transitional fossils found, that is fossils that have \"in between\" characteristics that link later groups with earlier groups, but these transitionals usually have precise characteristics that were predicted by the theory of evolution even before their discover.\n \n \n Actually, you have been lied to here from my knowledge. The fossil record does not show \"in-between types\". Darwin said that the absence of such intermediates was the \"most obvious and serious objection\" against his theory. Nearly 150 years later, Dr David Raup, the head of one of the great museums in America, said that the situation concerning missing links \"hasn't changed much\" and that \"we have even fewer examples of evolutionary transition than we had in Darwins times.\" The Late Dr Colin Patterson was Senior Paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History as well an being an evolutionist and a fossil expert. He wrote a significant book on evolution - but when someone asked him why he did not show any pictures of in-between forms in his book, he wrote the following:\n \"I fully agree with your comments on the lack of direct illustration of evolutinoary transitinos in my book. If I knew of any, fossil or living, I would certainly have included them. You suggest that an artist should be used to visualise such transformations, but where would he get the informatino from? I could not, honestly, provide it, and if I were to leave it to artistic licence, would htat not mislead the reader? I wrote the text of my book four years ago [in the book he does talk of his belief in some transitions - my dialogue]. If I were to write it now, I think the book would be rather different. Gradualism is a concept I believe in, not just because of Darwin's authority, but because my understanding of genetics seems to demand it. Yet [famous fossil expert stephen J.] Gould and the American Museum people are hard to contradict when they say there are no transitinoal fossils. As a palaeontologist myself, I am much occupied with the philosophical problems of identifying ancestral forms in the fossil record. You say that I should at least \"show a photo of the fossil form which each type of organism was derived\". I will lay it on teh line - there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument.\"\n \n Patterson came under fire from fellow evolutionists for having made this and similar candid admissinos, and attempted to soften the remarks retrospectively. However, the language is clear and unmistakable. \n Stephen Jay Gould, evolutionist said this: \"The lack of transitional fossils is the trade secret of palaeontology\". All quotes came from \"The Revised Quote Book\". You interestingly bring up human evolution. Human evolution is blank and filled with a tonne of holes that would sink the Titanic. Let us go through the basic evolutionary candidates:\n * Australopithecines (Lucy fossil type):- Dr Charles Oxnard is one of a growing number of evolutionist anatomists who have examined vast numbers of measurements by computerized multivariate analysis (an objective method that does not  depend on preconceived beliefs about ancestry), do not believ that these creatuers are human ancestors. He states that although initally it was though that they were human-like or at least intermediate between apes and humans, the reality is that they \"differ more from both humans and African apes than do these two living groups from each other. THe australopithecines are unique.\" Recent CAT scans of the bony labyrinth which once housed their organ of balance have shown conclusively that they did not  habitually walk upright, as many still insist. \n \n * Homo Habblis:- Many scientists (evolutionary scientists included) are now recognising that Habblis is a waste bin of two or more creatures, and hence, is an invalid category. Even so, the CAT scans have determined that Habblis was less  bipedal than Australopithecines. So we are actually \"de-evolving\" if you will. \n \n * Homo Erectus and Neandertals:- Once again, CAT scans have shown that Erectus and Neandertals walked up right just like us. They would be able to run,hop, skip, jump, etc, and do all the things that we do today. Many scientists now classify erectus and neandertals as \"true humans\". And it has been known that Neandertal types had been living at the same time as \"modern\" types. Tools found on an Indonesian island in associatino with stegodon (an extinct elephant) remains have cause evolutionist Dr Alan Thorne to suggest that these so-called \"pre-human ancestors\" had seafaring skills and technology. As far back as 1993 he said, \"They're not [i.e. shouldn't be called] Homo erecus, they're people\". This quote came from the Australian, 19 August 1993.\n \n If one uses the evolutionists' own timescales and criteria for classification and plots all \"hominid\" fossil discoveries on a chart, it will readily be seen that the idea of any evolutionary sequence is a shambles. (M. Lubenow, \"Bones of Contention\").\n \n I found it interesting that you got your information from talkorigins.com. They totally do not know what they are talking about. In one article that I saw regarding SNRs they totally changed the scientific evidence to suit their own theory, as for one, the article was not written by an educated person, nor did it have any references - unlike the article on SNRs that was written by Answers in Genesis. Many of their arguments, like the one on your link can be easliy refuted. Other articles employ what is known as the \"straw man\" argument tactic, i.e. using an argument that can be easily refuted and one that is not held by anyone. \n \n If evolution is true, than we should expect to find millions and millions of fossils of in-between forms, right? Well, the truth is, we don't. Some evolutionists claim there are some - maybe a handful - of such in-between fossil types (highly, highly, highly debatable). Other leading experts have rejected soe or all of these. What is not well known is that the interesting fossil creature Archaeopteryx, often used as an example of a transitional form between reptiles and birds shows none of the crucial transitinoal structures which would strongly argue for \"transitional\" status. The feathers are fully formed, and the wings are proper wings. It has the backward-facing claw and curved feet characteristic of perching birds. It wasmost definitely not, as some would reconstruct it, a running feathered dinosaur. \n \n In fact, the same can be shown to be true for whale evolution animals such as the Ambulocetus and the Basilosaurs. These are not evolutionary transitional forms, as you are often told. Many evolutionists do not even acknowledge them, but this does not mean that they don't believe in their theory.\n \n So in this respect, the fossil record does not show evolution as you are commonly told. In fact, it tells us that things breed true to their kind, i.e. horses produce horses, cats produce cats and so on.\n \n You than go onto challange:\n \nWhat predictions can creationism make? Does belief a creator necessarily imply that such fossils will be found? If evolution predicts them, and creationism makes no predictions, what will it mean if and when such fossils are found?\n \n \n Actually the Bible/creation makes quite a lot predictions that science has recently verified. Some examples include: that the Earth is round (Isa. 40:22); the Earth is suspended in space without support (Job 26:7); sea currents; the hydrologic cycle; the first and second laws of thermodynamics (e.g. Isa 51:6); and the fact that Orion cluster is seperating and that the Pleadies cluster is staying together as a group (Job 38:31); and many others. Since there was a global flood according to the Bible, we would expect there to be many fossils rapidly despoited and this is what we see in some parts of the fossil record. For example, there are some fossil beds are found in sedimentary rock, deposited by water so rapidly as to bury some creatures while still giving birth and eating food. Creationists have also made predictions such as the fact that there can be variation with in a kind, but one kind cannot change into other kinds. This is what we observe now in the present, and is backed up by the fossil record. We would expect that many rocks, such as Uluru in Australia, would not be \"ordered in layers\". Once again, this is what we observe. Creationists predicted that mutations and natural selection are down hill processes, i.e. information losing. We would also expect everything to be running down, we might also expect to know that some dinosaurs survived the flood but most likely died in the ice age that followed the flood. Several cultural groups have given very descriptive information about dinosaur like creatures. Remember, they would not have had a picture book with dinosaurs in it, the Aboriginal's for example, had paintings of dinosaur like creatures in caves; the amazing amount of design and complexity in the universe; Laws of Nature. Also many other predictions. \n \n So as you can see, creationists have made many predictions (as has the Bible) and all are 100% scientificly correct. IF, if such fossils are found and they are obviously transitional, then that would certainly aid the evolutionist case. But evolution is supposed to have millions of transitional fossils, they have a hand full of highly debatable ones.\n \n Btw, I am not trying to impress you by any means of your imagination. If I wanted to impress someone I could stay here and away from the internet. It is just that \"evolution\" is not as \"scientific\" as you may think.",

What of it? Yes, there is disagreement on whether the specimens themselves represent a direct ancestor or a closely related side branch. What of it? The point is that these fossils are clearly intermediate in characteristics between modern humans and ancient apes.

And H. erectus are not modern humans - they are even more distinct than the Neanderthals.

   "I am sorry, most of the information was \"off topic\" stuff. But the information about the genetic information was true, as my example illustrated. I was implying the GTE (General Theory of Evolution) that states life came from lifeless chemicals (without intelligence) and than evolved into the variety that we see today. All evolutionists acknowledge \"spontaneous generation\" as the majority of them are atheist. So what you are doing is taking the over all theory and breaking it up into several parts, such as astronomical evolution, chemical evolution, geological evolution, biological evolution? That is fine. I was just looking at the whole theory. \n \n Mr Jack:\n Dawkins states:\n \n[Not arguing with creationists] This is not because I cannot answer their arguments, but because I have better things to do with my time and I do not want to give them the oxygen of publicity.\n \n \n Well either way he didn't answer the question. I saw the video. I saw and heard his responce. He can't squirm his way out of the fact that he didn't know the answer. \n The internet site also quotes:\n \nNow perhaps it could be argued that Prof Dawkins' memories of the events might have deteriorated with the passage of time since the interview, so let us consider the general plausibility of what the tape purported to show. A question was asked relating to \"evolutionary process which increases the information content of the genome\". This question was not asked of just anyone, but of a biologist whose speciality is precisely in that field, who has been teaching biology at Oxford University for 27 years, and who is very experienced in answering the far more complex questions of some of the best students in the world. It beggars belief that someone of Richard Dawkins' stature in the field would have been stumped by such a simple question or would have evaded it.\n \n \n Fine, he had about 11 seconds of silence and that time period is normal. Then why didn't he answer the question? I couldn't really care if it took him five minutes to answer the question, at least give us an answer!\n \n It also quotes:\n \nBecause their volumes of unscientific dogma are having no effect in the scientific debate, they resort to trickery in order to denigrate their critics, and to mislead unsophisticated minds.\n \n \n What ever. It was a simple question. There is no trickery or any nasty evil plan behind it. Just face the facts, he didn't answer the question in the video, he didn't answer it in the three pages that he got to present his case, he DOESN'T KNOW THE ANSWER. Everything in the video \"From a Frog to a Prince\" is scientific and true. Creationists appear to have a better understanding about genetics than the evolutionists! Dawkins is just cut that creationists asked a question to which he had no answer.\n \n They quote:\n \nIt begins to look, then, that this is a piece of crude propaganda (see note below), deliberately manipulated to give the false impression that the fact of evolution is seriously under scientific question, and that the fanciful notions of creation `scientists' are contributing to that debate.\n \n \n Well then, my skeptic fellow Australians, what is the answer to the question? Do any of you guys here know? I sure as hell don't. Creationists did not misquote Dawkins because the words came from his mouth. And Dawkins is a professional at biology, but he could not answer such a question.\n \n \n In the little amount of fossils that we do see, they are not evolutionary. There is no clear cut fossils showing the evolution of man, is there. By \"true human\" I mean they were just like us, just varients of human kind that we have today - looked human, walked like us, most likely were quite intelligent.

Rather, evidence to the contrary of the theory is necessary to disprove it. By the way... have you read the book referenced in this link? (Unweaving the Rainbow, specifically the chapter titled`The Genetic Book of the Dead') I have not. Though, I would guess if you really wanted to find an answer to the question, you could read the book. According to Dawkins, you will find an answer there. Without having read the book, how can you claim that Dawkins cannot answer the question?\n \n If you wish to continue this line of thought, I suggest you start a new thread with positive evidence that suggests creationism is scientifically valid. When you start digging, you will see that there is no known evidence that supports a literal translation of the creation in Genesis. But if you do find any, please let us know. Personally, I think that would be kinda cool if evidence turned up that refuted all the previous evidence gathered that has led to the theory of evolution as we know it today. That would be BIG news!!!",

   "Sorry, astronomyfan, I didn't welcome you properly to the board - just launched into the argument without any preliminaries. Welcome to 4forums, and I hope you enjoy the debates here.\n \n I also apologize if my posting style seems terse at times - I am not purposely being dismissive - I am now in my last term of graduate school, I have an entire dissertation to write by June (or perhaps earlier - I don't yet know the summer travel schedule of my committee members), so I'm pretty busy and have to write very quickly at times.\n \n Now, to comment on you last post.\n \n The problem with talking about so many different items in one post is that each topic you bring up is a complicated topic that needs an entire discussion devoted to just that to do it justice. Plus, there are so many misconceptions in the creationist community about these topics, and that makes it even more complicated to straighten out.\n \n I will just say a little about genetic \"information\". I have a background in the physical sciences, so I know a little about the role mathematical models play in science. A model never proves or disproves a theory. The only thing a model can do is provide, we hope, insight into the workings of a theory if it agrees with observation.\n \n Now, evolution is a demonstrated fact. The fossil evidence that I provided in my initial post to this thread is just some of the great amount of evidence, in many different, independent scientific disciplines. The fossil evidence along with the heirachical classification of life and radiometric dating show pretty conclusively that evolution has occurred.\n \n Now someone can come up with a mathematic model, like genetic information theory, and show how it is inconsistent with evolution. But when the physical data support evolution the best assumption is that the model is wrong. I don't have to study information theory - I know, from the available data, that evolution has occurred. If information theory says otherwise, then there is something wrong with information theory, or at least the way it is being applied to genetics and evolution theory. And, in fact, there is a huge discussion on how this application of information theory is wrong - people who know more about it than I, and who are interested in it (I confess to not finding it a very interesting topic of conversation myself) have found the flaws in it.\n \n So be careful when people come up with some mathematical calculation that shows something is impossible. If the data shows otherwise, then there is something wrong with the calculation - probably there is a bad assumption somewhere.\n \n So, bringing up information theory is not going to sway very many people. Not when the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that evolution has occurred. If you want to disprove evolution, then you have to show positive evidence that the earth is only 6000 years old, and you have to show why the evidence in favor of evolution, like the fossil record, is not really evidence after all.",

   "Now let us point out one major flaw with evolution: that mutations plus natural selection does not equal evolution (an increase in the genetic information).\n\n Where did you ever get the idea that evolution has anything to do with an increase in information. Evolution is a change in the frequency in alleles in a population over time. You are raising a straw man, and then you are doing a bad job of knocking it down.\n \nThis is very important as molecules to man evolution needs more new information that previously did not exist to come into the genome (DNA content of a species) for the species to evolve or change.\n\n Great. Then I'm sure that you can support that assertion with references to the scientific literature. Please indicate why the duplication of a gene (observed) followed by a mutation in one copy (observed) is not the addition of information. You see, where there was once a single gene that produced a single protein. After the mutation there are two different genes that produce two different proteins. And even if we fall back on the Shannon definition of information as the number of bits required to represent the message (ignoring for a moment that we await your definition of sender, receiver, and message), certainly since it requires more bits to represent the genome (assuming that that is the message, correct me if I am wrong) after the duplication and mutation, certainly information has increased.\n \n I snipped you silly example because it doesn't demonstrate anything. There are several mechanisms of evolution, some act to increase genetic diversity and some act to reduce it. In fact, natural selection acts to reduce the genetic diversity in a population, even Darwin was aware of that. So it seems that you equate genetic diversity with information. Thus, mutations (along with other mechanisms) since they increase the genetic diversity, also must act to increase the information, by your own example.\n \n As you said, \"So natural selection by itself results in a loss of information from a population.\" Yes, that may be true. However, there is more to evolution than just natural selection. For example, gene flow, recombination and mutation all increase genetic diversity (information by your claim). On the other hand, natural selection, sexual selection, and genetic drift all act to eliminate diversity.\n \nAn example where both natural selection and mutations work together to enable a creature to survive also results in a loss of genetic information. Consider that flightless bird in the Galapagos Islands, oh, what is it's name? I think it is called something like the flightless conrade.\n\n Oh goody. Some more of your well informed opinion based on wishful thinking, no research and even less actual thought. Probably the bird you are talking about is the Cormorant (Nannopterum harrisi). Yes, it is flightless because it has no need to fly. There were no natural preditors in the Galapagos and the bird is a sea bird. It swims and eats fish. It's wings are much reduced because it swims by kicking rather than by \"flying\" through the water like a penguin. Like the penguin it is a diving bird.\n \nAnyways, this bird does not have any feathers and as a result it can swin and dive quite well.\n\n Actually, the bird is fully feathered. The feathers offer insulation and of course, when impregnated with oil, buoyancy. Where did you get your information? Well, no matter. You bought it hook, line and sinker. Did it occur to you that you should possibly check your \"facts\"?\n \nIt is important to note that this bird has a mutation that stops the bird from forming any feathers.\n\n No it doesn't.\n \nAs a result of this appearent advantage it left more off spring on the island and itsurvived while the other birds with feathers died out.\n\n No they didn't. There are many kinds of birds on the Galapagos that both have feathers and can fly. There are boobies (masked booby Sula dactylatra, red-footed boobySula sula, and blue-footed booby Sula nebouxii), frigatebirds (the great frigatebird Fregata minor and the magnificent firgatebird Fregata magnificens), the brown pelican Pelecanus occidentalis, red-billed tropicbird Phaethon aethereus. All of the above are sea birds. The boobies are graceful and powerful flyers. They will climb to 40 or 50 ft and power dive into the water when they spot a fish.\n \n One of the most graceful and beautiful flyers can be found on the Galapagos, the waved albatross Diomedea irrorata.\n \n There are three species of storm petrel (white-vented (Elliot's) Storm petrel Oceanites gracilis, band-rumped (Madeiran) storm petrel (Oceanodroma castro[/i], and the wedge-rumped (Galapagos) storm petrel Oceanodroma tethys). Again, these are fully feathered and flighted sea birds.\n \n Audubon's shearwater Puffinus iherminieri is yet another sea bird that is found in the Galapagos.\n \n Finally, there is the Galapagos penguin Spheniscus mendiculus, another flightless although feathered bird. The penguin \"flys\" through the water by flapping its wings.\n \n In addition there are 13 species of finch (Darwin's finches) and a mocking bird. All of them fully feathered and able to fly. In fact, there is no example of a bird in the Galapagos that does not have feathers. In fact, I think that is true of the entire world. Birds, all birds, have feathers. It would take a creationist to imagine otherwise in the face of the facts.\n \nThe the adaption here is natural selection by mutation. The bird has lost the ability to produce feathers, and natural selection eliminates the birds with feathers, hence, losing the gene for the production of feathers.\n\n Poppycock. Poorly researched a passed along as if it were meaningful. Surely one of the best examples of the working of \"creation science\" that I have ever encountered. You would make Mr. Hovind proud - speaking with authority but without knowledge and getting it wrong. Congratulations.\n \n By the way, here is a couple of pictures of the Galapagos cormorant. The panel on the right in the first picture is the flightless cormorant from the Galapagos.\n \n http://www.rit.edu/~rhrsbi/GalapagosPages/Pictures/Pelicaniformes/cormorant.jpeg\n http://www.worldbirder.com/photo/photos/551.jpg",

   "I was implying the GTE (General Theory of Evolution) that states life came from lifeless chemicals (without intelligence) and than evolved into the variety that we see today. (snipped) So what you are doing is taking the over all theory and breaking it up into several parts, such as astronomical evolution, chemical evolution, geological evolution, biological evolution? That is fine. I was just looking at the whole theory.\n\n \n The 'general theory of evolution' is a made-up idea of the Creationist camp. There is The Theory of Evolution, which the body of ideas developed from Darwin's original theory of descent with modification by natural selection. It does not deal with the origin of the first replicators. The origin of life question (commonly refered to as Abiogenesis, but not to be confused with the 'theory' of spontaneous generation as disproved by Pasteur) is a different matter.

   "astronomyfan,\n \n Let's talk about your genetic example.\n \n You claim that if there were a gene for tallness (T,t) and that TT people were tall, Tt people were medium and tt were short and if a machine gun fired at random intervals over the heads of the tt people but low enough to hit the TT and Tt people, that pretty soon the population would be made of only tt people. Actually, I think that something else would be more likely to occur. Perhaps another mustation in the population would become apparent, like the dominant gene (D,d) that imparted the ability to duck really fast so that DD and Dd people would be able to duck so fast as to avoid being shot, while dd were too slow. This would produce a total of 16 genotypes grouped into 6 phenotypes. Of these, only an average of 3 out of 16 would be both too tall and slow (1) or medium and slow (2). 9 out of 16 would have the ability to pass along the T gene and it would be passed on about 61% of the time.\n \n But suppose there is another gene, (H,h) that imparts really good hearing such that an HH individual hears the machine gun XXXX every time and is able to duck before it fires. Hh hears less well and is able to duck half of the time, and hh never hears it XXXX. Now there are 64 genotypes in 18 phenotypes. Out of the 64 only three would be tall, slow and deaf, while another 4 would be tall and slow but would hear the gun XXXX about half of the time. Of course, in both situations, 25% would survive anyway (4 and 16). Now if you think that this reduces information, then it should be no big deal for you to describe each of the phenotypes and how many individuals are in each.\n \n Besides, in the real world lethal genes aren't all that common. They do tend to get eliminated from small populations but they are also recessive and will tend to hang around in large populations. In other words, in the situation that you give it would be TT and Tt individuals surviving while only tt would be eliminated.\n \n But lethal genes aren't all that significant. What is important is the survival advantage that a gene gives a possesser in a given environment. It isn't a sure thing that a tt will die. What is sure is that TT and Tt will tend to produce more offspring than tt. That's natural selection - it is the differential reproduction of advantageous genes.\n \n I'm waiting for you to define information.\n \n Also, I agree with Mr. Jack. To intentionally propagate a lie is as good as telling the lie in the first place. The creationist story about Dawkins is a lie and you are propagating it. Don't you think it would have been nice to inform yourself of the facts in the first place? I'm sure you'll do better in the future.\n \n Aslo in agreement with Mr. Jack, there is no such thing as the \"general theory of evolution.\" That is a creationist straw man invented in order to lump other fields of science into evolution, along with such ideas as progress, and increased complexity as requirements for evolution. It's bogus. We are not breaking the theory into parts, rather you are lumping pieces that don't belong. Evolution is concerned with living organisms and only living organisms.

   "Astron said:\n \n \nWhat is not well known is that the interesting fossil creature Archaeopteryx, often used as an example of a transitional form between reptiles and birds shows none of the crucial transitinoal structures which would strongly argue for \"transitional\" status.

Im not entirely sure what \"proper\" wings are. Could you tell me how the \"proper wings\" of Archaeopteryx differ from the forelimbs of basal dromaeosaurids and troodontids?\n \n Next you say Archaeopteryx had \"the backwards facing claw\". It sure did. But then again, so did some non-avian theropods (e.g., Microraptor zhaoianus, Hwang et al 2002). What are \"curved feet\"? Is this a reference to the ungals?\n \n So, since you've got such a poor job on your own, i'll ask you directly: can you isolate a single \"birdy-trait\" possesed by Archaeopteryx but not non-avain dinosaurs?",

   "This alone does not allow evolution to proceed. In a recent video produced by Answers in Genesis titled \"From a Frog to a Prince\" the presenter questions Dr Richard Dawkins (reknown evolutionist from England): \"Dr Dawkins, can you give us just one example of a mutation, or any other evolutionary process that has been seen to add information to the genome?\" Dr Dawkins answer was a shock, nearly 19 seconds of silence. When he finally responded the answer he gave did not answer the original question. The Australian Skeptics Association gave Dr Dawkins three whole pages in which to defend himself, and he still didn't answer the question. There is no doubt that Dr Richard Dawkins is still an evolutionist, one of the most powerful, so don't get the impression that he doubts evolution.\n \n Ok, the reason he couldn't answer the question (if any of the story is true) is because no one can answer that question. The reason is that when DNA is mutated we have no idea if \"information\" was added or deleted. It just doesn't work that way. We can know if bases were added, deleted, or substituted, or if whole sections of DNA got shifted (frameshifting) or whatever. But then to decide whether or not \"information\" was added or subtracted is beyond our current capabilities.\n \n We have only just sequenced the human genome, and several simpler genomes, (sigh, and the human genome is not the most complex, btw), to my knowledge the best we can do so far is decide, based on experimentation that a particular mutation caused a beneficial effect, a detrimental effect, or no observable effect. We can also induce mutations by site directed mutagenesis and then let the genes do their thing and see what the effect was, if any.\n \n Now, we talk about \"information\" being in the genetic code because we can pick out a particular sequence and see that it coded for the translation of a particular protein, and we can call that sequence a gene. We say that the \"information\" needed to translate the protein was in the sequence of bases. But we are currently incapable of deciding whether \"information\" was added or subtracted.\n \n To decide whether \"information\" was added or deleted, would be quite speculative at this point in the progress of the field.\n \n If you want to say that adding one base to the sequence is \"adding information\" then this has been observed in nature many times and done in the laboratory on a routine basis.\n here are a few quick googles:\n http://www.nobel.se/chemistry/educational/poster/1993/site.html\n http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/10_02/natural_radio.shtml\n http://www.hyperdictionary.com/dictionary/prophage\n \n and the last one was to show that sometimes a virus will insert its DNA into the genome of the host and may lay dormant for some time, this is called a prophage. i don't see how this could not be a mechanism for introducing \"information\" to a genome, if you are so conceptually inclined to interpret it that way",

The Information Challenge.\n \n But you do at least try to define information. Biologically speaking, if there is a mutation in a gene in an organism that creates an allele of a gene that didn't exist before, then strictly speaking, the information of the genome has been increased. You see, if information is defined as the number of bits necessary to represent the message, then it takes more bits to include the new allele in the definition.\n \n I think that you may be on the right track when you say that even though we can see that a mutation has caused the encoding of a different protein that we have to wait to see if information was added. But I think that you are being too restrictive. What we have to wait for is to find out if it is useful information. Ultimately, the information in a genome is a reflection of the environment in which the organism lives.\n \n A clear source of an increase in information would be gene duplication followed by a mutation.

Skull A is a modern chimpanzee - it is shown to demonstrate how Skull B, from an Austalopethicine, is very ape-like and definitely not human. Skull N is modern human. Note that the skulls in between show a very smooth transition between B to N, without any gaps. It is also true that the skulls are dated to the correct times. This is predicted by evolution.\n\n ursus, i have a question, and forgive my ignorance, but ive never gotten a solid answer to this... im looking at the image of transitional skulls starting at chimps (which exist today) to humans (which also exist today). my question is, how come the homonids, at say skull position H, completely vanished out of existence, while their much less evolved chimpanzee realatives are thriving today?\n \n of course, this question cannot discredit evolutionary theory, and im sure someone out there has addressed this. its just that ive never seen a good explanation to this. thanks",

   "Hope you don't mind if I jump in here.\n \n First off, a minor point. There is no such concept as \"less evolved\" We aren't more evolved or less evolved than chimps, just differently evolved. I realise that wasn't a central point or anything, but it's a common mistake and I felt it should be corrected.\n \n Now, to answer your question. A species can disappear in two ways. First, it can be wiped out, become extinct. Secondly, it can evolve to the point where it is no longer recognizable as the original species, and has to be considered a new one. That's what happened with the hominids.",

One population evolved into the modern chimpanzee (a forest animal), and the other into modern humans (a savannah animal).",

On the other hand, if you put an individual erectus in the forest environment in which the chimp survived, probably the chimp would be better adapted.",

By this time there are a set of beings around who are far more closely related to present day Homo sapiens  and are the best candiates as our ancestors from this time period. If we go back to about 6-7 ma, we find Sahelanthropus tchadensis, which does seem to be a good canidate as an ancestor to both humans and chimpanzees.\n \n So, humans have not evolved from chimps, but both chimps and humans share a common ancestor.\n \n Here are a couple of articles that discuss this in more detail:\n \n Homonid Species \n \n Prominent Homonid Fossils\n \n If nothing else, these serve to show the complex and varied history of our line.",
