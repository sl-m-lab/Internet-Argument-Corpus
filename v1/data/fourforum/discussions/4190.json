   "Joe, I hear you loud and clear. My partner works for a company which is operated by a religious organization. Granted, because of this I cannot recieve domestic partner benefits because as a religious organization they do not have to offer what they feel goes against the teachings of their \"church.\" Honestly, I'm fine with this. BUT...(and that's a really big \"but\"), if they were a secular corporation and if they did offer such benefits, I would indeed be SOL if anything were to happen to her. \n My son, thankfully is covered through his father's insurence, but it's not full coverage. His father is in the military and our son only gets medical health coverage, no dental, no vision care. Not to mention the absolute nightmare of finding a participating physician because we don't live anywhere near a military installation. I have to pay for what the military doesn't cover out of pocket. And I do. \n Thankfully, BC/BS does offer children's coverages of which you can actually pick and choose what options or how much coverage is needed. I pay a WHOLE LOT LESS covering him as a dependent through my individual coverage than if my partner's company were to extend \"family\" or \"domestic partner\" benefits to us. \n \n \n Now the really scary part: If my partner and I were to get into an accedent and I were killed, my son would NEVER again see the parent who has raised him since he was eight years old. He would be forcibly removed from my partner and sent to live this his father and family. A father who elected to not be an active part of my son's life. A father who until I had the courts go after him for delinquencies, was a \"Dead-beat-dad\", and who bounced child support checks regularly. \n Because my partner and I cannot legally marry, she cannot request for the courts to remove his father's parental rights and adopt my son as a second parent. Because we cannot legally marry, if anything were to happen to me, she would have absolutely no legal standing to even request visitation with the boy she has helped to raise. \n \n This is what I call SCARY!",

   "These seem like the real arguments for gay marriage. Protections.\n \n Even if I die queitley in my sleep tonight, my partner will not be offered COBRA. He is just SOL. He will also need to pay inheritience tax on any belongings which we jointly owned or I left to him in the will. I left him everything of course. By the time the taxes are done with things, it is unlikely he will be able to afford the house anymore. So he will lose the place we have lived all these years. And vice-versa if it happens to me.",

Also, the employer must pay Social Security and unemployment taxes on the value of the benefit.\n - A same-sex partner is NOT considered a member of hiis/her partner's family for purposes of obtaining a life insurance policy for two or more members of a family.(i.e. both partners, or both partners and one or more of their children).\n - A gay or lesbian state or municipal employee cannot obtain insurance coverage for his/her partner or partner's child.\n \n http://www.members.cox.net/vljones1/Workers_issue_ending_marriage_discrimination.htm\n \n or this\n \n Continued health insurance\n Under COBRA, when a married person loses a job, employers are required to offer the employee and his or her spouse access to 18 months of continued health coverage.
