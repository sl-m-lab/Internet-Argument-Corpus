This is not why I hate it, but it is the beginning of the reason why I have little sympathy for it. And yes I know this is just my unfounded opinion, but I thought it worth stating.\n \n I dislike religion because it is a security blanket. It is a nice way for people not to face up to the reality of existence, to allow them to pretend life has meaning, and that they are destined for a better place.

Religion poscribes the very essentials of human existence. It looks down on lust, essential for procreation. It condemns our natural instincts. By making people feel guilty over their very natures (original sin anyone?) and by telling them the only way to alleviate this guilt is for them to subjugate themselves to God (of course God can't be with you right now, but here is a nice man in a priests robe for you to confess all those nasty sins to.

That means it's your duty to kill them all, the heathens. Thankfully it's not like that in the west too much these days. But religion is still the major factor in almost every current conflict, and has been used to justify so many atrocities throughout the ages that it cannot be excused.\n \n And now on to Christianity in particular. Like I say at the start I have no particular qualm with it above other religions, that is not to say I have no qualm with it at all. Unlike most atheists, and indeed many many Christians, I have read the Bible. And I find it abhorrent. The idea that a supposedly benevolent force can subject such cruelty and suffering for the 'crime' of people disagreeing with him, that he is justified in sending untold billions to an eternity of torment just because they didn't leap to conclusions over meagre and contradictory 'evidence' to his existence is vile. I would never elect a creature so debased to have power over me in government, why should I support, nay worship him with my soul because of threats and bribery.\n \n Nb looking back at this post I have used the term you/your occasionally.

(though I believe you were probably just using the term 'caveman' to imply the humans that first invented the concept of 'religion')\n \n I don't believe there is any evidence to suggest that humans ever lived primarily in caves. Please feel free to correct me if anyone knows evidence to the contrary. Though I'm certainly no expert on the subject, according to what I've read --< there is no evidence for the practice of salvationist religions in the two or three million year history of humanity until sometime between 6,000 and 12,000 years ago (give or take). It is my understanding that this is the time period in which humanity either invented the concept, or conceivably, God revealed Godself to humanity. Humans as intelligent as us lived for thousands of years prior to the advent of religions.

   "I think Phunting basically summed up my thoughts.\n \n My problem isn't with Christians, it's with religion in general. As religions go, I'd say Christianity is one of the better ones.\n \n I think that one of the critical constructs of religion, \"I'm right, you're wrong, and I'm better than you\", is offensive. Not only to non-believers, but to everyone. It's pure arrogance, and completely unfounded. That construct has led to A LOT of UGLY history, it even rears its head in the initial post of this thread. Not Christian = evil. \n \n It doesn't end there though, the amount of infighting and attempts to establish superiority of all the different factions within Christianity is also rather repulsive to me. \"We believe in the same God, but I read the passage this way, THE RIGHT WAY, and you don't, you're wrong, I'm better than you, and because you don't see things my way, you're likely going to hell despite your belief in God.\" How nice.\n \n I do have some issues with Christians individually, just check out the posts by terral03 in the Easter Story thread. I find that SOME Christians, especially those that consider themselves fundamentalist, are very arrogant and righteous in there dealings with not only those that don't believe, but with fellow believers as well. \n \n I've always thought that hell, and how quick some Christians are to condemn a non believer (and believers as well) to their notion of hell, to be incredibly hypocritical. We love you, but if you don't do as we say, well, \"put on your thermal long johns\". Again, nice touch.\n \n My family is Roman Catholic. My wife's family is Roman Catholic. They are all wonderful people. I don't place any kind of negative tag on someone simply due to their belief in God. To each his own. I don't think any more or less of a person based solely on their religion, I base it on the actions of the individual.\n \n Waxy\n \n P.S. Monty - in most cases, the ire you raise in people has little to do with the fact you're Christian.",

Please define 'false repentance.' The NT Greek for repentance means 'change of perception.' We repent about anything when we change our view/opinion/mode of dealing about something. And, repentance 'may' lead to salvation, but it is not a required element or precept of obedience to the gospel. \n \n Phunting << Religion poscribes [proscribes? As in disallows?] the very essentials of human existence. It looks down on lust, essential for procreation. \n \n Terral's reply << Desire is the key element. And if you mean 'hunger for\" or \"ache for,\" then there is nothing wrong with lusting for your wife. Part of true Christianity is recognizing the struggle between the spirit and the flesh (Rom. 8:5, Gal. 5:16-25). Therefore, lusting after all women leads to negative results. The path of the spirit leads to higher things, while running after the flesh leads to lower things. Therefore, our New Testament does not disallow the very essentials of human existence. \n \n Phunting << It condemns our natural instincts.

And, no book ever made anyone feel anything. People make themselves feel one way or the other. We must be responsible for our own feelings (anger management 101). \n \n Phunting << And religion justifies war and violence. If your God is right (and of course he must be, after all it is written down on a bit of paper that the priest handed out) then everyone else must logically be wrong.

Maybe zero? So perhaps we should grant more weight to the subject of religion, so that we can develop strategies for the future. Hating their religion is certainly not the 'enlightened' answer. BTW, experience tells me that living under a king is like being an alcoholic. For change, you really have to want it for yourself. The people of Iraq are used to living under a King. That is their mindset according to their religious beliefs and history. Therefore, the very best we can hope for by forcing them to sober up is a bloody civil war. And that explains why we can never leave there, and why so many of our children will continue to die there. \n \n Phunting << And now on to Christianity in particular. Like I say at the start I have no particular qualm with it above other religions, that is not to say I have no qualm with it at all. Unlike most atheists, and indeed many many Christians, I have read the Bible. And I find it abhorrent. \n \n Terral's reply << How can the entire Bible be anything? The OT is basically stories about our origin and prophecies of what will happen regarding this chosen race called Israel. The NT is more stories about how those same things are being fulfilled, with the addition of a mystery. The whole thing is written so that the faithful will understand, while the skeptic understands nothing. The key difference is the 'spiritual birth' that accompanies salvation of the believer. \"Abhorrent\" seems a bit hard core to say the least. There certainly appears to be more going on under the surface, with regard to this topic, than meets the eye.\n \n Phunting << The idea that a supposedly benevolent force can subject such cruelty and suffering for the 'crime' of people disagreeing with him, that he is justified in sending untold billions to an eternity of torment just because they didn't leap to conclusions over meagre and contradictory 'evidence' to his existence is vile. I would never elect a creature so debased to have power over me in government, why should I support, nay worship him with my soul because of threats and bribery.\n \n Terral's reply << Okay. Here is where the rubber meets the road for me in this discussion: First off, let us look at what the Bible says about those who disbelieve. Then let me provide my view of 'why' it is this way. Most people (even unbelievers) know the most famous verse of the Bible. Here it is: \"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.\" John 3:16. \n \n What most people never read is what follows, so let's read on a little bit. \n \n \"For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him. He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.\" John 3:17+18. \n \n They key words here are \"has been judged already.\" Here is the deal in a nutshell: Everything in this universe, right down to the very nature of the atoms themselves and light itself, was ripped apart at its very core. The singularity life expression became the spirit/flesh male/female dual nature we see today. This guy you do not believe in (Satan) led the rebellion and one third of the angels of heaven were cast down. Some were part of the deception and some were merely deceived. Instead of casting everyone into the furnace, God Almighty devised this plan to separate the innocent from the guilty, even though ALL OF US have been judged already. \n \n Every one of us is now standing directly in front of His face, as we have been since the foundation of the world. And all of this is happening in a single moment (outside this realm of time and space) to Him, but within creation the created spheres turn slowly. We have been given time to have our change of mind/perception. And every one of us agreed that this judgment would be final. After all, we were judged already and found guilty. So what is there to lose? Therefore, you have no sympathy for believers, and I have none for non-believers who continue to remain in that condition. Let's continue a bit more with God's Word:\n \n \"This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world (Genesis 1:3), and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed.\" John 3:19-20.\n \n People tend to fear those things that they do not understand. Your excellently written testimony above seems more about fearing something not yet understood, than about actually hating anything. Even though everything that I visualize within the boundaries of my faith is in perfect light, you cannot see those things, and a shroud of darkness stands in your way. I also have read the entire Bible several times, and the NT hundreds of times; working in the original languages over the different manuscripts. The need I am feeding is not ignorance or modes of behavior born out of complacency. \n \n I was rightfully condemned, and now I am righteous in His eyes; not because of any work I did, but because I chose to believe and trust Him and His Word (Light; see John 1:4-12). That ignited the spark of the new spiritual nature in me (new/inner man; Rom. 7:22, 2Cor. 2:16, Eph. 3:16), which must be sustained by feeding upon His Word. And now I wait for the redemption of my physical body, while He continues offering this free gift to everyone else. It is the new man 'in me' that can place all the pieces of the puzzle, so that I can fathom the riches of His great mercy and love, and faith. Now there is a burden in my heart for others to experience the same thing. Since there is great desire in your heart over this topic, perhaps there is still hope for the future.\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "To whomever may care,\n \n I don't hate anyone. I don't hate christians or christianity or any other religion or \"relationship\". \n \n I do have a fondness for arguing. I especially find amusement in arguing with people that are close-minded. I'm not saying that I think people are close minded because they are christian or of any other religion. But, there are definitely some that are, just as there are some of any type of person that are close-minded. But, most religious folks are pretty close-minded when it comes to their religion. They usually have a book, and if it's in the book there's no alteration, that's it, that's all.\n \n You may think that because a person is debating your beliefs they are attacking your faith or that they do not like you, or even hate you. I think that deep down, they are arguing with you out of love. Yes, the same love that causes a christian to preach and proselytize. Each side thinks the other is misled and hopefully they can be helped to \"see the light.\" Close-mindedness on either side can cause frustration, that may lead to animosity and maybe even hostility, despite the initial good intentions.\n \n I think that the resistance to christianity as a whole stems from the people and images that tend to overtly represent christianity, yet do not seem to actually follow its tenets. Here, in the U.S., the main source of exposure to christianity than most non-religious people see comes in the form of ignorant rednecks or snake-oil salesmen on TV, whose message tends to be \"submit or burn in hell\" or \"send us your money.\" \n \n Personally, I think the basic teachings of Christ are great. That is, if those teachings are what I think they are: \"love your fellow human beings, peace is great stuff, vain material possessions are futile, etc etc.\" I think I would add \"love your fellow living beings and the home you and they share.\" But those are not what the average non-christian sees or hears coming from so-called christians. They do not debate with Joe Average Christian, who is a well-meaning, normal family person that just happens to be christian. \n \n So, the more we see the Benny Hinns, Pat Robertsons, and Jimmy Swaggarts (would you believe that when I was younger my mom brought me to his church, we lived in Baton Rouge, La. at the time) and the redneck preaching damnation on a soapbox in the middle of the quad at your local college, the more resistance to christianity you will see and hear. If certain so-called christians were to be more Christ-like, there wouldn't be nearly as much opposition. \n \n Thanks for reading. \n \n emoticon_love",

   "I don't have anything against Christian's. I mean I don't go to church but I believe that's thier a GOD! The question that I have is why is it that if a person has doubts then that means that they don't believe in GOD? I've heard a lot of Christian people say that if you don't believe everything in the bible then your not a true believer. But I have doubts how can you not? But that doesn't mean that I dont believe in GOD! And another question....which I don't know a lot about Christians so I'm not trying to be mean. But I use to know these 2 Christians that lived with me and my friend for a while. And they were very wierd. She one day said that she was bringing someone over to bless the house. Me and my friend was kind of ify about this!! But the person came over and was going around the house saying stuff in tounges, and then the women was saying that the evil spirt was in her. And I'm sorry but most Christina's are against Witchcraft but what I saw that day was a form of Witchcraft. I just don't understand?? Christian's are confusing???? Blue emoticon_xbouncer",

I wish others would take the time to elaborate upon their thoughts and feelings while sticking to the topic.

Religion is man's attempt to bind himself back to God using works and rituals. Judaism is a true religion in every sense of the definition. True Christianity is not a religion at all. It is a relationship between the Creator and the believer through His Son by power of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, I believe what you hate is actually 'false religion' that has been created by the mainstream denominations (demon-inations). \nI see little distinction between the two. I do not see how you can claim that christianity isn't a religion. And what do you mean by 'true christianity'?\n \n 'Demon-inations'? I do hope that was a joke, and that you are not heading down Rapture's route of claiming that everyone who disagrees with his exact interpretation of Christianity is the willing servant of Satan.\n \n \n \nOuch! Just how far back are we going? Cavemen? If civilization is tied to the invention of the plow, and every word of our Bible was penned after about 1600 BC, then let's leave the cavemen out of the discussion. \nIndeed. But as I stated I am not being specific to Christianity, or any Judaic religion. Of course I don't think that Neanderthals read the bible. My point was that I see the idea of a 'god' as being an explanation for matters that were incomprehensible to the ancient man. It evolved and got refined, as science always does. But then it stopped, and instead of advancing with science it retained it's outmoded explanations because people had forgotten that they were best guesses and started regarding them as divine truths.\n \n \n \nSince true Christianity is a 'faith,' perhaps you will consider not herding everyone into the same corral. \n I appreciate that I am making extreme generalisations throughout the entire post, but this can't really be helped. For the most part these generalisations are (IMO as always) true. Of course I accept that their are many who fall outside of them, but they are still a minority.\n \n \n \nAnd the fact that Christ was born on this earth and fulfilled a ton of prophecy, well, we can address that later.\nI don't really want see how this is relevant to my statement that it is a 'security' blanket'.\n \n I'd of course dispute the 'ton of prophecy' claim, but this probably isn't the right thread to go into that in.\n \n \n \nIn other words, the fact that our Bible gives people 'faith and hope' is an issue. BTW, some people find the meaning of life in things like mathematics, biology, photography, criticizing/discounting the faith of others, and a myriad of other life long, dream fulfilling activities. Building a case for hating mathematics does not seem a viable option for me, simply because others base there life around it. So perhaps your true hatred is over the perceived false promises of a better place that is offered by Scripture, i.e., the hope of immortality. \nI take your point. I agree my problem with faith in this case is faith in what I consider an imagined realm. I think in the religious case it says 'it's ok for you to be oppressed in this life, just lie back and take it and you'll be rewarded in the next'. It seems a weak excuse to keep the masses placid.\n \n \nFrom all accounts, our forefathers built this country as one nation under God with liberty and justice for all, and as Bible believing God-fearing Christians. Also, many innovative things have come from the thinking minds of professing Christians and Jews alike. Where would we be now if all of their contributions to the world were suddenly removed? Perhaps we would return back to your caveman days. Therefore, I believe it unfair say that unbelievers hold the keys to 'true enlightenment.' \nIndeed they did/have. But I would say three things, firstly that these achievements came for the most part in spite of, not because of religion. Secondly yes, in the past religion was often the best explanation for things that we had available, therefore it isn't surprising that everyone believed, yet today it is an out-dated mode of thought. And finally, as I have stated I accept there are always exceptions.\n \n And no, I don't think unbelievers necessarily hold the keys to 'true enlightenment' either. But I just see religion as the wrong path. Of course this, like your own view is entirely subjective.\n \n \n \nWell, I shall endeavor to provide you with a thoughtful reply in light of my stupidity. \nNo offence meant. I don't consider you stupid, I don't consider the majority of believers on this forum stupid, I don't consider many Christians I have met stupid. But I do believe that religion is a system to keep the masses stupid, thankfully it just doesn't work as well as it would like. \n \n \n \nThis post seems more about the writer's current prejudices, stereotypical behavior and disregard for those who believe in something they cannot see, touch, smell, etc.. \nIn what way?\n \n \n \nPlease define 'false repentance.' The NT Greek for repentance means 'change of perception.' We repent about anything when we change our view/opinion/mode of dealing about something. And, repentance 'may' lead to salvation, but it is not a required element or precept of obedience to the gospel. \n Yet it is still a major part. Repentance is a 'get out of jail free' card, it allows people to alleviate their guilt without ever addressing the real problem. By saying '10 hail marys' does a person really confront the problem, or just get a clean slate so they can do it again?\n \n \n \nproscribes? As in disallows?\nYes.\n \n \n \nDesire is the key element. And if you mean 'hunger for\" or \"ache for,\" then there is nothing wrong with lusting for your wife.

The path of the spirit leads to higher things, while running after the flesh leads to lower things. Therefore, our New Testament does not disallow the very essentials of human existence. \n Why? Why must things be seen in such black an white terms? It may lead to negative results, it may not. Nothing is so simple in real life.\n \n \n \nAgain, please do not confuse false religion of the denominations with true Christianity. By placing all of your 'religious' people into a single group, and dismissing the substance of all spiritual things as 'non-essential,' then Satan has already won your soul, without the firing of a single shot. \nBut I have yet to see what makes 'true christianity' any different to 'false religions'. \n \n \n \nBTW, experience tells me that living under a king is like being an alcoholic. For change, you really have to want it for yourself. \nI live under a king, does that make me equivalent to an alcoholic?\n \n \n \nThe people of Iraq are used to living under a King.

And that explains why we can never leave there, and why so many of our children will continue to die there. \nI am not just talking about Iraq, I am also talking about Al Quaeda, Israel, Northern Ireland. Im talking about the holocaust, the crusades, the civil war, the inquisition, the missionaries. Almost every act of genocide and destruction imaginable is steeped in religion. How can anyone claim that this is a good thing?\n \n \n \nHow can the entire Bible be anything? The OT is basically stories about our origin and prophecies of what will happen regarding this chosen race called Israel. The NT is more stories about how those same things are being fulfilled, with the addition of a mystery. The whole thing is written so that the faithful will understand, while the skeptic understands nothing. The key difference is the 'spiritual birth' that accompanies salvation of the believer. \"Abhorrent\" seems a bit hard core to say the least. There certainly appears to be more going on under the surface, with regard to this topic, than meets the eye.\nPossibly. I don't deny that it contains some good aspects, but equally it contains pretty explicit view against women, homosexuals, and 'unbelievers' that I do indeed find abhorrent.\n \n \n \nOkay. Here is where the rubber meets the road for me in this discussion: First off, let us look at what the Bible says about those who disbelieve. Then let me provide my view of 'why' it is this way.\nI refer to the whole of the section you posted, but for reasons of space I have only quoted the first paragraph. You say that unbelievers are guilty of working with Satan, how can that be if we do not believe in him? To say that we are all inerently evil, that we all have automatic sin that can only be absolved by our running to Christ is just a tool to subjagate people to the church's will. It claims that everyone, no matter who they are is going to be punished unless they do exactly as they say.\n \n I too can quote scripture:\n \n \nJohn 3:36\n he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.\n\n \nRomans 1:18\n For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness\n\n \nHebrews 3:6-12\n But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end. Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years. Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways. So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.) Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.\n\n \nRevalations 21:8\n But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\nI don't care about the supposed justification for it it is quite clear. If you do not act as I say, you will burn in hell by my wrath. This is the speech of a maniac, a paranoid tyrant who tries to bully everyone to his will. I will not be subject to such people.\n \n \n \nGod Almighty devised this plan to separate the innocent from the guilty\nAfter all, we were judged already and found guilty.\nThis appears to be a contradiction, how can their be innocents if we are all judged guilty?\n \n \n \nPeople tend to fear those things that they do not understand. Your excellently written testimony above seems more about fearing something not yet understood, than about actually hating anything. Even though everything that I visualize within the boundaries of my faith is in perfect light, you cannot see those things, and a shroud of darkness stands in your way.\nI of course disagree. This is personal opinion on both our parts, where you see it as me clouded by darkness, I see the same thing of you.\n \n \n \nSince there is great desire in your heart over this topic, perhaps there is still hope for the future.\nIt is interesting isn't it, why something I disagree with should hold such fascination at the same time.\n \n Whew!

I also find them greedy & hypocrites. And they are way to much religion in todays politics. Like for instance our so called born again Christian administration have invaded Iraq. They did not threaten us for 12 years. My theory is to let a sleeping dog sleep. And now look at what we have our selfs into. As far as the preachers on TV they just want money and they don't spread the good word of God. Alot of them screem and carry on about what who knows what.

   "Greetings to Phunting, Waxy (his companion Apathy) and All:\n \n Waxy writes << My problem isn't with Christians, it's with religion in general. As religions go, I'd say Christianity is one of the better ones.\n \n Terral's reply << If your above statement were true, then your next five paragraphs would be about religion, and not about problems you are having with Christians. \n \n Waxy << I think that one of the critical constructs of religion, \"I'm right, you're wrong, and I'm better than you\", is offensive. \n \n Terral's reply << Is your math professor 'better than you,\" because he or she knows more about the subject than you do? And yet, when you go into the classroom to make a fool of the teacher, what kind of response should be anticipated? But then, your problem would not be with math teachers. Your problem would be with math. \n \n Waxy << Not only to non-believers, but to everyone. It's pure arrogance, and completely unfounded. That construct has led to A LOT of UGLY history, it even rears its head in the initial post of this thread. Not Christian = evil. \n \n Terral's reply << Are we talking about your problem with religion in general here? Or about a particular problem you are having with a Christian? Would you guess that the people who planned and carried out 9/11 were Christian or non? Heads are hitting the ground over in the Middle East. The sword carriers are Christian or non? Pearl Harbor, Christians or non? Hitler, a Christian or non? \n \n The Apostle Paul tells us, \"For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual {forces} of wickedness in the heavenly {places.} Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm.\" Eph. 6:12+13.\n \n Waxy << It doesn't end there though, the amount of infighting and attempts to establish superiority of all the different factions within Christianity is also rather repulsive to me. \n \n Terral's reply << Again, are we talking about the problem you are having with religion in general, or the ones you are not having with Christians? Your post seems more about a personal problem you are having now with someone calling himself a Christian. Let's investigate:\n \n Waxy << \"We believe in the same God, but I read the passage this way, THE RIGHT WAY, and you don't, you're wrong, I'm better than you, and because you don't see things my way, you're likely going to hell despite your belief in God.\" How nice.\n \n Terral's reply << So, we are upset over the manners of Christians, as they battle over interpretations of Scripture. I cannot imagine one saying to the other, \"I am better than you.\" But I can certainly see how an unbeliever could come to that conclusion. Again, what does the Scripture say? \n \n \"I solemnly charge {you} in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom: preach the word; be ready in season {and} out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but {wanting} to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires, and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths. But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.\" 2Tim. 4:1-5.\n \n What does it mean to 'reprove, rebuke and exhort'? Especially when we honestly feel that the souls of men are at stake? Scripture specifically tells us that there are those who will not endure sound doctrine. Peter also says that many will distort this wisdom to their own destruction (2Pet. 3:14-16). It is as if we are all living in one huge building, and some of us know that our dwelling is on fire. The battle over souls in this current darkness has obviously been taken more seriously by some than others. To that I plead guilty as charged.\n \n Waxy being honest << I do have some issues with Christians individually, just check out the posts by terral03 in the Easter Story thread. I find that SOME Christians, especially those that consider themselves fundamentalist, are very arrogant and righteous in there dealings with not only those that don't believe, but with fellow believers as well. \n \n Terral's reply << There seems to be some assuming going on here. Apathy (a proud non-believer) is over there trying to harass Christians. Saying, \n \n Apathy << \"If I must I'll come back to this but there is more to life than arguing with Christians (it's so fun though). \"\n \n Terral continues << But you have no problem with poking fun at Christians, right? That is why you joined in with him on this same thread. Here is a notice for all professing Christians and unbelievers alike: My letters are addressed to the principals of the discussion and All for a reason. In the end, the third party audience is the judge on the merits of all sides of the debate. The forum of debate is not about winning or losing an argument over a topic. It is about the presentation of opposing views. Therefore, should we find ourselves on opposite sides of the topic, then you should expect to be presented with the opposing view. \n \n Do not expect me to bow down to the unbeliever's attempts to discredit my testimony; from his words of intimidation, name calling, harassing tactics, etc.. Instead, expect those things to come back at you with some mustard spread on for good measure. This God fearing Christian is armed for battle (Eph. 6:12-17) and with the full armor of God (Eph. 6:13). \n \n Who is really being arrogant here? The professing Christian who is reproving, rebuking and exhorting over topics contained in Scripture? Or the unbelievers who are here just to make fun of Christians? What drives the unbeliever to post in the Religion/Bible section anyway? You sensed my discontent with Apathy for coming over just to poke fun at Christians. So now I am being judged by you (his unbelieving companion) for my reaction. This is a quite clever attempt to setup position on the moral high ground. \n \n Anyone reading the posts in that thread will find that I asked Mr. (having fun with Christians) Apathy to please present his question in the form of a Biblical Contradiction. Instead, he cuts and pastes links from all over and asks Christians to tell him a story. If you see a contradiction, then type it out, and we shall give a thoughtful reply. But, neither of you are seeking any kind of answer to any given question. This is really about having fun with Christians. Are we having fun yet? \n \n Waxy << I've always thought that hell, and how quick some Christians are to condemn a non believer (and believers as well) to their notion of hell, to be incredibly hypocritical. We love you, but if you don't do as we say, well, \"put on your thermal long johns\". Again, nice touch.\n \n Terral's reply << When a person comes into the religion/bible section and proclaims boldly that he is here to have fun with Christians, then he is marking the area, like an animal, with the stench of his unbelief. That is like me going over to the homosexual section and starting a thread with smiley faces proclaiming to be there to have fun with the homos. What sort of welcome should I expect? So do not try to pull the wool over this old man's eyes. They would come out of the woodwork with expletives of every sort. Then I could be like you and say, \"My problem isn't with homosexuals, it's with homosexuality in general.\" Nice touch.\n \n Waxy << My family is Roman Catholic. My wife's family is Roman Catholic. They are all wonderful people. I don't place any kind of negative tag on someone simply due to their belief in God. To each his own. I don't think any more or less of a person based solely on their religion, I base it on the actions of the individual.\n \n Terral's reply << Ah, a contradiction. Above your problem was with religion in general. So your problem is really not with religion, but with a particular Christian, i.e. with terral03. Well, this Bible believing Christian is not going to cow down to a couple of unbelievers out to have fun at someone else's expense. In case you are also unaware of what is written in your history books, more people have died in wars over religion than for all the other reasons combined. Your 'to each his own' motto would serve you well here also. \n \n In Christ,\n \n Terral",

   "How 'quaint' a description. However, you said this...\n Post 88 of the thread \"Islamic Fundimentalism Vs. Nazi Germany\" under \"Current Events\" subject\n \n It does seem like you have a problem with Christianity. In the same post you then raved about how great Islam is because it allows rich people to go to heaven.\n\n \n Nope, still no problem with christianity. It is an excellent religion for dictators and tyrants, so I suppose that is a problem with the religion itself, but not a personal problem I have with it. \n \n I also don't recall \"raving\" about how great islam is (and you and I both know it).\n \n Here is what I said:\n \n \nIslam is not a very good religion if you wish to be a tyrant. Muslims have no problem with wealthy people going to heaven. They also seem to have no problem with killing off their rulers who displease them.\n\n \n \n That is all I said about muslims and rich people goingot heavan. I that really a rave?\n \n \n \nWell you sort of said something about Jesus, although we don't know much about Him might have done some bad things. Certainly you said it was likely His disciples slept with children. By implication then, Jesus is guilty.\n\n \n No, I said that it was almost certain that his diciples slept with \"children\" since some of them we know were married, and people in those days married as \"children\" (using your definition of \"child\"). If Jesus was himself married (which we cannot entirely rule out the possibility) there is very little doubt that HE slept with a \"child\". \"Child\" is a relative term. In the US, a child is under 18. In parts of Africa even today, childhood ends at around 10-12. Not everywhere on the planet do people have the luxury of coddeling their children for the first 20 years of their life like we do here. In the past, 20 was middle age, people were expected to grow up fast. \n \n \nThen you made relativist argument for defending Mohammed for doing just that!\n\n \n Yes, I did. I pointed out that Muhommad marrying a \"child\" was not at all unusual at the time. It is just the way things were. \n \n \n \nJohn 21:25\n Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.\n Acknowledgement that not everything was written - no problem, because we've got Holy Tradition\n\n \n Yes, and where did we get holy tradition? It seems like maybe we need to question holy tradition a bit, since an awful lot of it does not fit with what we know about that period, and it still seems to carry with it an awful lot of unanswered questions (like, exactly why did the diciples carry sword if not to hack at people with them?)\n \n \nOdd that you'd repeat a second time this non-Catholic argument. Catholics (like we Orthodox) don't rely only on the teachings contained in the Bible. We have \"Holy Tradition\" (I suggested you go speak to your priest about this)\n\n \n Maybe you need to take another look at the catholic church. Thee are an awfull lot of catholics out there who don't entirely buy the party line. It used to be that the Church would excommunicate them and then torture them to bring them back to \"right\", often followed by a round ofsexual abuse by priests in the even t that the subject was a woman. No justification was ever really given for this (the sexual abuse).

   "Oh, pipe down, Terral. The thing with most of the religious people I know is that they take these things too personally. You can barely get a word in edgewise without nearly having a crusade declared upon you. \n \n Anyways, back to dear Monty's query...\n For those of us who question Christianity and religion in general, not attack it, we question it because it makes no sense/ it is not logical/ whatever. (Or at least, that's the case for me. emoticon_xgood ) The fact that we even have the nerve, nay, the audacity to question incenses people. I'm not referring to anyone on this thread, but several people see questioning as a threat to their comfortable way of life. But that's human nature, isn't it? We question things, we poke and prod, turn it around, upside down, etc. It is a human's natural curiosity that makes us question, not that we have some hidden agenda that just makes us want to \"attack\" christianity. \n Also, what makes muhammad evil? Is it because he is not Christian? Or is it for some other reason?",

   "Greetings to Phunting, Waxy (his companion Apathy) and All:\n\n \n OK, from the start, I'm not apathy, nor am I his companion. I have never stated my objective as to \"make fun of Christians\" nor have I ever done so. You can check with many others on this board (Big Orn) for verification if you'd like.\n \n You made an unfounded assumption and you ran with it.\n \n \nWaxy writes << My problem isn't with Christians, it's with religion in general. As religions go, I'd say Christianity is one of the better ones.\n \n Terral's reply << If your above statement were true, then your next five paragraphs would be about religion, and not about problems you are having with Christians.\n \n \n They are for the most part. When specific, they are about Christianity. I'll remind you that the title of this thread is \"Why are you anti-Christian.\" Enough said.\n \n \nWaxy << I think that one of the critical constructs of religion, \"I'm right, you're wrong, and I'm better than you\", is offensive. \n \n Terral's reply << Is your math professor 'better than you,\" because he or she knows more about the subject than you do? And yet, when you go into the classroom to make a fool of the teacher, what kind of response should be anticipated? But then, your problem would not be with math teachers. Your problem would be with math. \n \n \n This is a really weak analogy. \n \n Increased knowledge of math is not a means by which to profess moral superiority and condemn anyone without such knowledge to hell. No level of knowledge of Chrisitianity changes the facts.\n \n \nWaxy << Not only to non-believers, but to everyone. It's pure arrogance, and completely unfounded. That construct has led to A LOT of UGLY history, it even rears its head in the initial post of this thread. Not Christian = evil. \n \n Terral's reply << Are we talking about your problem with religion in general here? Or about a particular problem you are having with a Christian? Would you guess that the people who planned and carried out 9/11 were Christian or non? Heads are hitting the ground over in the Middle East. The sword carriers are Christian or non? Pearl Harbor, Christians or non? Hitler, a Christian or non?\n \n \n Religion in general.\n \n What is their motivation? Is it religious? Are you claiming that Chrisitianity has no blood on its hands of this sort?\n \n How about the crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, Salem witch hunts, the missionaries sent to save the savages (Have you ever seen the movie Black Robe? It's an excellent movie about French missionaries sent to Canada to convert the Native Americans.)\n \n \nWaxy << It doesn't end there though, the amount of infighting and attempts to establish superiority of all the different factions within Christianity is also rather repulsive to me. \n \n Terral's reply << Again, are we talking about the problem you are having with religion in general, or the ones you are not having with Christians? Your post seems more about a personal problem you are having now with someone calling himself a Christian. Let's investigate:\n\n \n You can read what you like into the post Terral, play the martyr if you choose, but it isn't there.\n \n This point was in direct reference to Christianity, but it is certainly not limited to Christianity. The biggest problems in handing over power in Iraq are due to the warring of different Muslim factions.\n \n \nWaxy << \"We believe in the same God, but I read the passage this way, THE RIGHT WAY, and you don't, you're wrong, I'm better than you, and because you don't see things my way, you're likely going to hell despite your belief in God.\" How nice.\n \n Terral's reply << So, we are upset over the manners of Christians, as they battle over interpretations of Scripture. I cannot imagine one saying to the other, \"I am better than you.\" But I can certainly see how an unbeliever could come to that conclusion. Again, what does the Scripture say? \n \n \n Manners? Not at all, get into fist fights if you want. It's the absurdity of the entire affair that I find leaves a bad taste.\n \n If you think that only an unbeliever walks away from these debates with the impression that one says \"I'm better than you\", you have on some serious blinders. Every faction claims to be right, and every faction believes that their interpretation of the Bible is superior and therefore they are superior. That's blatantly obvious to any observer on these boards. \n \n If you didn't feel that your beliefs and interpretations are superior, why challenge other's beliefs? \n \n Why are there different factions of Christianity at all?\n \n \nWaxy being honest << I do have some issues with Christians individually, just check out the posts by terral03 in the Easter Story thread. I find that SOME Christians, especially those that consider themselves fundamentalist, are very arrogant and righteous in there dealings with not only those that don't believe, but with fellow believers as well. \n \n Terral's reply << There seems to be some assuming going on here. Apathy (a proud non-believer) is over there trying to harass Christians. Saying, \n \n Apathy << \"If I must I'll come back to this but there is more to life than arguing with Christians (it's so fun though). \"\n \n Terral continues << But you have no problem with poking fun at Christians, right? That is why you joined in with him on this same thread. Here is a notice for all professing Christians and unbelievers alike: My letters are addressed to the principals of the discussion and All for a reason. In the end, the third party audience is the judge on the merits of all sides of the debate. The forum of debate is not about winning or losing an argument over a topic. It is about the presentation of opposing views. Therefore, should we find ourselves on opposite sides of the topic, then you should expect to be presented with the opposing view. \n \n Do not expect me to bow down to the unbeliever's attempts to discredit my testimony; from his words of intimidation, name calling, harassing tactics, etc.. Instead, expect those things to come back at you with some mustard spread on for good measure. This God fearing Christian is armed for battle (Eph. 6:12-17) and with the full armor of God (Eph. 6:13). \n \n Who is really being arrogant here? The professing Christian who is reproving, rebuking and exhorting over topics contained in Scripture? Or the unbelievers who are here just to make fun of Christians? What drives the unbeliever to post in the Religion/Bible section anyway? You sensed my discontent with Apathy for coming over just to poke fun at Christians. So now I am being judged by you (his unbelieving companion) for my reaction. This is a quite clever attempt to setup position on the moral high ground. \n \n Anyone reading the posts in that thread will find that I asked Mr. (having fun with Christians) Apathy to please present his question in the form of a Biblical Contradiction. Instead, he cuts and pastes links from all over and asks Christians to tell him a story. If you see a contradiction, then type it out, and we shall give a thoughtful reply. But, neither of you are seeking any kind of answer to any given question. This is really about having fun with Christians. Are we having fun yet? \n \n \n See my first sentence Terral.\n \n I clarified my response in the Easter Story thread. I'll admit the first post was pretty glib, but I stated the reasons why.\n \n I presented my views in this thread, in no way were they poking fun at Christians. That's your perception. You seem a might sensitive on the subject.\n \n Who's trying to get you to bow down? You're not the victim of a massive anti-Christian conspiracy. You need to relax, you've got your knickers all in a bunch here for no reason. Put the mustard down, take a deep breath, and step back. No one is going to come knocking on your door. \n \n I am having fun, seeing someone get so worked up over such trivial matters is always entertaining.\n \n \nWaxy << I've always thought that hell, and how quick some Christians are to condemn a non believer (and believers as well) to their notion of hell, to be incredibly hypocritical. We love you, but if you don't do as we say, well, \"put on your thermal long johns\". Again, nice touch.\n \n Terral's reply << When a person comes into the religion/bible section and proclaims boldly that he is here to have fun with Christians, then he is marking the area, like an animal, with the stench of his unbelief. That is like me going over to the homosexual section and starting a thread with smiley faces proclaiming to be there to have fun with the homos. What sort of welcome should I expect? So do not try to pull the wool over this old man's eyes. They would come out of the woodwork with expletives of every sort. Then I could be like you and say, \"My problem isn't with homosexuals, it's with homosexuality in general.\" Nice touch.\n\n \n Do you know who you're replying to in this post? Or has your rage toward apathy (exactly the response he was hoping to get out of you) blinded you completely?\n \n What kind of a response is that to my assertion about hell? Especially as it is used by \"some\" Christians?\n \n \nWaxy << My family is Roman Catholic. My wife's family is Roman Catholic. They are all wonderful people. I don't place any kind of negative tag on someone simply due to their belief in God. To each his own. I don't think any more or less of a person based solely on their religion, I base it on the actions of the individual.\n \n Terral's reply << Ah, a contradiction. Above your problem was with religion in general. So your problem is really not with religion, but with a particular Christian, i.e. with terral03. Well, this Bible believing Christian is not going to cow down to a couple of unbelievers out to have fun at someone else's expense. In case you are also unaware of what is written in your history books, more people have died in wars over religion than for all the other reasons combined. Your 'to each his own' motto would serve you well here also. \n \n \n Ohhhhh poor persecuted terral03. emoticon_cry emoticon_rolleyes \n \n You'll start another holy war will you? One of the great benefits religion has bestowed on the world. \n \n Get off it. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n I don't see the contradiction. I don't like organized religion, religion is an entity separate from the individual. I can disagree with organized religion and still agree with or love an individual involved in that religion. Don't throw the baby out with the bath water as they say.\n \n I'm not sure what the crack you made in your last sentence means. Do you want everyone to just leave you alone? Why are you here then? Sure doesn't seem like it, unless you're just here to preach and you don't care if anyone reads or responds. That would be odd to say the least.\n \n Waxy",

   "Odd, I thought that calling Christ a mere fictional character equal to Harry Potter did seem like an attack on Christianity. Maybe you thought that it was a compliment?\n\n Actually, yes. Harry Potter stories are full of deep mysticism, referring to ancient pagan symbolism that still has deep meaning even in Christianized \"western\" culture. That's one of the reasons it is so popular. That's also why right-wing fundies object to it. Because the Jesus stories are founded on the same archetypes, but traditionally fundamentalists have always persecuted any and all attempts to explore any meanings mythological or otherwise, which predate Christianization of them.\n \n Again, I have no problem with people believing in a Son of God Jesus, or Horus, or Krishna, or Mithra. But if you expect me to believe that Jesus, (or Mithra, etc) was alive and hanging out in Galilee attracting \"multitudes\", but mysteriously escaping mention by historians of the day, you'll need to have some solid evidence.",

   "Hi Phunting:\n \n Thank you very much for the thoughtful reply. Please allow me to say straight away that, even though we are miles part in our perspectives, I am impressed by the sincerity of your replies. Plus, it is dawning on me that we share a dislike for organized man-made 'religion.' The difference is that you view the RC Church as the cornerstone of Christian Religion, while I see them as being a false religion. \n \n Terral Original << The Latin 'religios' means 'to bind back.' Religion is man's attempt to bind himself back to God using works and rituals . . . Therefore, I believe what you hate is actually 'false religion' that has been created by the mainstream denominations (demon-inations). \n \n Phunting << I see little distinction between the two. I do not see how you can claim that christianity isn't a religion. \n \n Terral's reply << I understand the confusion. Since you have never seen the real dollar bill, what tools do you possess to recognize the real thing? Those from the denominations have created man made religions by combining the precepts of a gospel based upon Kingdom Doctrine [repentance and water baptism (Mark 1:4, Acts 2:38), justification by works and not by faith alone; James 2:24] and Grace Doctrine [Christ crucified; redemption through His blood (Eph. 1:7); justification by faith apart from works (Rom. 4:5, Eph. 2:8+9). Instead of being baptized into the body of Christ (1Cor. 12:13, Eph. 1:13+14 'sealed in Him), according to the 'mystery of Christ' (Eph. 3:4), they are being gathered into the body of the antichrist, according to the 'mystery of lawlessness' (2Thes. 2:7). Therefore, the world views Catholicism (for example) as a true form of Christianity, when in actuality it is a counterfeit. \n \n True Christianity is not a religion, because it is not based upon the works that we do for membership (unlike Judaism 'real religion' and Catholicism 'false religion'). Paul tells us, \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, {it is} the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.\" Eph. 2:8+9. And again, \"Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due. But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.\" Rom. 4:4+5. Those who are obedient to the 'foolishness of the message preached' (1Cor. 1:21) are added to the 'body of Christ' (Rom. 12:4+5) by a baptism of the 'One Spirit.' 1Cor. 12:13. We then rest in the work that Christ did for us on the cross at Calvary. \n \n By contrast, the RC Church (and sister denominations) teaches that the 'one baptism' (Eph. 4:5) is that water ritual performed by human hands (Mark 1:4, Acts 2:38). They have taken the Spirit of God out of the equation and placed themselves into the position of our intercessors (Spirit; Rom. 8:26+27, Christ Rom. 8:34). Satan has taken a combination of precepts from both gospel messages of our New Testament and has sold that to humanity (2Cor. 4:3+4), as a heavenly way that leads to hell (see 2Thes. 2:7-12 again). \n \n Phunting << And what do you mean by 'true christianity'?\n \n There are two spiritual bodies under construction during this time:\n \n 1. the body of Christ (believe the gospel and add nothing to it)\n \n 2. the body of the antichrist (add works and rituals to the gospel)\n \n Everyone is looking for the antichrist to appear in the form of a man. That too is a myth, and that serves to distort the truth that 'the mystery of lawlessness is already at work.' 2Thes. 2:7. Therefore, of two bodies are being built, the world views the body of the antichrist as a form of 'Christian Religion.' True Christians are the faithful remnant who have believed Paul's gospel (Rom. 2:16, 16:25 about 1Cor. 15:1-5), and have been baptized into His body (Rom. 6:3+4, Gal. 3:27) on the cross to become an active participant in Christ's death, burial and resurrection. \n \n Phunting << 'Demon-inations'? I do hope that was a joke, and that you are not heading down Rapture's route of claiming that everyone who disagrees with his exact interpretation of Christianity is the willing servant of Satan.\n Terral's reply << No sir. The Word of God is not joking. The insidious nature of Satan and his forces of darkness (Gen. 1:2, Eph. 6:12) are working overtime, and delusion (2Thes. 2:10) and deception are their primary weapons. Scripture teaches that there are sides to the battle, and men stand with both. \n \n The enemy position is not being held by willing subjects of darkness from among men. They have been deluded into accepting a lie for the truth, and live under the spell of the 'god of this world.' Paul writes, \"And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.\" 2Cor. 4:3+4. Lucifier is building the body of his antichrist using what you perceive to be Christian 'religion.' \n \n Phunting << My point was that I see the idea of a 'god' as being an explanation for matters that were incomprehensible to the ancient man. It evolved and got refined, as science always does. But then it stopped, and instead of advancing with science it retained it's outmoded explanations because people had forgotten that they were best guesses and started regarding them as divine truths.\n \n Terral's reply << Becoming a member of the body of Christ is about receiving the faith (Rom. 10:17) required to actually believe the gospel (Eph. 1:13+14). It is about placing yourself into the position of obedience to the Creator's 'good news' message concerning His Son (Rom. 16:25-27. It is about gaining direct access to the Father through His Son (Rom. 8:34) by the power of the Holy Spirit; about becoming one of the 'children of God.' Rom. 8:16+17. \n \n Ancient man did not have that opportunity, because Christ had yet to die for anyone. As far as the 'idea of God,' Scripture says, \"For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.\" Rom. 1:20. Since this covers all men (even your men from history), then your point seems a bit redundant, at least from the perspective of Scripture and the Creator. And I disagree with your premise pertaining to 'outmoded explanations.' The Holy Text is something that is alive and sustains the believer's spirit as food does the physical body. Therefore, your view above is based upon mere assumptions about things which, admittedly, you fail to understand. Please do not get me wrong. I can visualize what you are saying, but feel it important to point out the huge blind spot in your field of view.\n \n Terral's original << Since true Christianity is a 'faith,' perhaps you will consider not herding everyone into the same corral. \n \n Phunting contends << I appreciate that I am making extreme generalizations throughout the entire post, but this can't really be helped. For the most part these generalizations are (IMO as always) true. Of course I accept that there are many who fall outside of them, but they are still a minority.\n \n Terral's reply << However, your assumptions are based upon the notion that everyone calling himself a Christian is a member of the body of Christ. And, while you have claimed to have read the Bible, I also know that almost nothing I have come to understand about the mystery of Christ was understood in my first dozen or so readings of the New Testament. The best educated guesses are made by those who are properly educated on a particular topic. And your extreme generalizations (however true to you in your current state) remain just that to me. \n \n Phunting original << I take your point. I agree my problem with faith in this case is faith in what I consider an imagined realm. I think in the religious case it says 'it's ok for you to be oppressed in this life, just lie back and take it and you'll be rewarded in the next'. It seems a weak excuse to keep the masses placid.\n \n Terral's reply << I have never been accused of being placid. The Koran says that Christians and Jews are to be numbered with murders and thieves. That does not sound placid either. Paul says, \"For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual {forces} of wickedness in the heavenly {places.} Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm.\" Eph. 6:12+13. I would imagine that the easygoing docile natured folks are not the writers in these forums. That being said, I can see why you believe 'religion' wishes to control the masses. Again, Satan is the culprit and he has lulled many to sleep with false gospel messages from the denominations. But that is not true Christianity.\n \n Phunting << And no, I don't think unbelievers necessarily hold the keys to 'true enlightenment' either. But I just see religion as the wrong path. Of course this, like your own view is entirely subjective.\n \n Terral's reply << We agree that Religion is the wrong path, unless you happen to be a child of Israel under Mosaic Law. \n \n Phunting << But I do believe that religion is a system to keep the masses stupid, thankfully it just doesn't work as well as it would like. \n Terral's reply << We agree. So long as 'true Christianity' is not a religion, but a faith. Members of the RC Church were told not to read their Bibles for centuries. The congregation looked upon his back, as he did the mass in Latin. Today, every mass is basically the same rituals performed over and over again, and the people leave the building in the same condition as they first entered. Hundreds of millions of people have been chained to a man-made religion in the name of Christianity. \n \n Terral's original statement << This post seems more about the writer's current prejudices, stereotypical behavior and disregard for those who believe in something they cannot see, touch, smell, etc.. \n \n Phunting's query << In what way?\n \n Terral's reply << The post as a whole seems from a person with the well established mindset that all 'professing' Christians are the members of the Body of Christ. And that the 'majority' of religious people on this planet are stupid or somehow mentally challenged. In other words, \"They would have come to know better, but they became mired in the quicksand of religion.\" (Your exceptions to the rule duly noted). I was simply noting the fact that the words in your post were a reflection of those prejudices, i.e., that your original post was more about you than about the topic (seemed to me). \n \n Phunting original << Repentance is a 'get out of jail free' card, it allows people to alleviate their guilt without ever addressing the real problem. By saying '10 hail marys' does a person really confront the problem, or just get a clean slate so they can do it again?\n \n Terral's reply << Right here is the place in your post that I came to realize that our views are very much the same about the Roman Catholic Church. We are in full agreement. Nobody stands between the Father and the believer except the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:26+27) and Christ (Rom. 8:34). All of that Sacramental mombo jumbo is unscriptural and man-made. But again, Catholicism is not true Christianity according to the definitions of Pauline Doctrine. We are both against false religion.\n \n Phunting << Why must things be seen in such black an white terms? It may lead to negative results, it may not. Nothing is so simple in real life. But I have yet to see what makes 'true Christianity' any different to 'false religions'\n \n Terral's reply << It is the deluding influence [Satan, Lucifer, the god of this world] who draws the line in the sand. The war of the heavens has been taken up here on the earth. Paul says, \". . . and with all the deception of wickedness for those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved. For this reason God sends upon them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false, in order that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in wickedness.\" 2Thes. 2:10-12. \n \n Do you see those words that say \"did not receive the love of THE truth so as to be saved?\" I am talking to you in the precise terms proved in the Word of God, because there is such a thing as 'the' truth; because there is just one of them. God has opened the door to all those who will accept the gospel, without adding the works and rituals of their man-made religions. What shall we add to the blood of His Son to make it good enough? Answer: nothing. So, do not go in the way of those who add the work of water rituals or anything else.\n \n Phunting on the Bible << Possibly. I don't deny that it contains some good aspects, but equally it contains pretty explicit view against women, homosexuals, and 'unbelievers' that I do indeed find abhorrent.\n \n Terral's reply << I understand the reasoning behind the position of Scripture in each case, although women are not numbered among unbelievers and the immoral (Rev. 21:8). Question: Has a heterosexual couple ever defiled the mind and behavior of the natural child of a homosexual couple, and turned that child away from procreative process that brought him into being? The answer to that question is \"Absolutely not.\" Homosexuals cannot bear the natural children of their same-sex partners, because that behavior is unnatural. And yet, how many of our children are led astray by homosexuals? Do you remember making these remarks? \n \n Phunting old << \"Religion proscribes the very essentials of human existence. It looks down on lust, essential for procreation.\"\n \n Terral continues << Homosexuality does the very thing you accused religion of doing; exactly. And yet, \"you find abhorrent\" God's position against this form of immorality. \n \n As for women: Scripture says, \"Wives, {be subject} to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself {being} the Savior of the body.\" Eph. 5:22+23. It does not say that women are to be subject to men. \n \n My interpretation of the Biblical position is that the husband is half a person, and his wife is the other half. The man represents the spirit part, while the woman represents the body part. The two join together to become one flesh and bear seed, in the same way that the heavens and earth (Gen. 1:1) overlap to beget 'heaven' (Gen. 1:8). Woman has been placed a little lower than man, as men have been placed a little lower than the angels (Heb. 2:7,9); as the physical (seen) realm is lower than the heavenly realm. Peter says, \"You husbands in the same way, live with {your wives} in an understanding way, as with someone weaker, since she is a woman; and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered.\" 1Pet. 3:7. \n \n Phunting << You say that unbelievers are guilty of working with Satan, how can that be if we do not believe in him? \n \n Terral's reply << I explained that above how they are deluded into believing lies over the truth. They are baptized into the body of the antichrist by believing a false gospel message. 2Thes. 2:7-12. The world perceives them to be 'religious Christians,' when in fact they serve the god of this world; not knowingly, but believing all the time that they are serving the Creator. \n \n Phunting << To say that we are all inherently evil, that we all have automatic sin that can only be absolved by our running to Christ is just a tool to subjugate people to the church's will. It claims that everyone, no matter who they are, is going to be punished unless they do exactly as they say.\n \n Terral's reply << Complaining about our current situation on earth helps nothing. We are born into the condition of fallen man. God has provided the 'Way' for us to reestablish direct access to Him. We either take advantage of His offering, or we choose otherwise. Mankind is fighting a battle against the 'god of this world' over the souls of men and women alike. The enemy has disguised himself as an angel of light (2Cor. 11:14), and has deceived the masses into a deep sleep. Now we can pick up the weapons of this spiritual warfare and join the battle, or sit on the sidelines with our complaints. Still, your perceptions of this battle are governed by your preconceived notions about the Roman Catholic (Denominationalism) form of 'false religion.' I agree that you should say \"No\" to accepting their form of works and rituals in place of a relationship with God through His Spirit. \n \n Phunting << I don't care about the supposed justification for it is quite clear. If you do not act as I say, you will burn in hell by my wrath. This is the speech of a maniac, a paranoid tyrant who tries to bully everyone to his will. I will not be subject to such people.\n \n Terral's reply << Still, there are only believers on the other side of the veil of death. What matters is how we conduct ourselves on this side. God is closer to you now than your own breath. It is through Christ that the atoms of your body are held together (Col. 1:17). Consider that we all came here with the 'guilty' sentence upon us. (John 3:18; 'judged already.') What if our lives here represent the judgment, and our actions here determine the verdict. Peter warns that the ungodly shall be consumed in the coming fire reserved for creation. He says, \"But by His word the present heavens and earth are being reserved for fire, kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.\" 2Pet. 3:7. The unbeliever says, \"Aaaa, do not believe that hogwash!\" And what happens to those who believe him? Therefore, since unbelief stands between God and the redemption of others, then the unbeliever is placed in the same boat as the immoral. \n \n \n Terral original << God Almighty devised this plan to separate the innocent from the guilty. After all, we were judged already and found guilty.\n \n \n Phunting << This appears to be a contradiction, how can their be innocents if we are all judged guilty?\n \n Terral's reply << Because, some were out deceiving with Satan, and some were merely deceived. God intervened in the situation and cast Satan down, before death destroyed everything in this universe. The judgment is far from over, even when New Jerusalem is firmly established in the heavenly realm (Gal. 4:26). The forming of the body of Christ is about replacing Satan and his even forces of darkness in the heavenly. \n \n The (corrupt 666 Satan/Beast/False Prophet) sixth day heavenly man is being replaced by the new (777 Elijah/Christ/Moses) seventh day heavenly man. Then those children of God (baptized into Christ's body; 1Cor. 12:13, 27) shall judge the world and the angels (1Cor. 6:2+3), until all things are summed up in Christ. 1Cor. 15:27, Col. 1:20. Therefore, \". . . He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son.\" Col. 1:13. \n \n Phunting << It is interesting isn't it, why something I disagree with should hold such fascination at the same time.\n \n Terral's reply << That is my point about the whole thing. We are in full agreement about Catholicism, just as soon as we agree that it is a false religion. We both hate the same thing, and for the same reasons; just from different perspectives. I am not here to enlist you into any denomination. Becoming a Christian through the gospel will place you in direct opposition to everything modern Denominationalism teaches. Instead, I recommend a fresh reading of your New Testament starting in Romans to Philemon. Those are the only verses of Scripture that are addressed to Gentiles, and they represent God's personal mail 'to' you. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

How you see a connection between these is very odd. The many 'campaigns' on this forum are no indicator at all that I support violence. In fact, I've gone out of my way to state on many occasion that I'm against killing - and believe it's a sin, even in self-defence. (although I did make a poor joke about Ronald Ray-gun burning in hell). It is in fact why I've debated on the Guns forum for gun control, and the Current Events forum against the aggression of the USA towards Iraq (and divers other nations)\n Second problem; there's one thing that's different from not believing in Christ to believing in something that is of itself anti-Christian. Many people here believe in things that are intrinsically anti-Christian.\n Islam for example holds beliefs that are decidedly anti-Christian (as posted elsewhere). A sub-part to this problem concerns opinions that are not necessarily anti-Christian, but are none-the-less put forward on this debate forum. Doesn't it seem rather odd that you would be criticising someone on a debate forum who debates? Perhaps we could start a \"Let's all agree\" debate where no one actually presents opposing views. The idea that we can all live in harmony and peace is a fine ideal, but if that means remaining silent on certain issues, then it's a rather skewed world view.\n One debitor had stated her views on Christianity;\n a) she hated a large number of them, especially their leader\n b) she questioned a member of her own family who was a member of that church\n c) she stated that Christ was a myth\n d) she said that Islam and Christianity were on the level.\n e) that the teachings of Christianity could and were used to support\n i) Crusades and genocide\n ii) misogyny\n iii) child abuse\n iv) rape\n f) a number of other ills were caused by Christians \n It would be remiss of me not to refute these things.\n Now you may think that because I've attempted to retort your statement that I've attacked you. I can't help how you feel, although it's not my intent that you should feel that way. I will continue to debate whilst I'm permitted to.",

   "I'd like to hear from some of you out there that attack Christianity. What is it about our Lord, or His teachings so annoys you?\n \n On one post I see someone comparing an evil man like Muhammed to Jesus Christ. Or, Mizmaxx compares Harry Potter to Christ, believing both are 'fictional'.\n \n But why this hatred for the Prince of Peace? Why tear Him down?\n\n \n The Aussie asks a great question, but be careful Montalbaln. Questions and answers always lead to one road...understanding.\n \n First, it's not out of hatred, immorality, work of the devil, ignorance, etc.\n It actually arises from me in exactly the opposite manner. \n \n To make a long story shorter, I was raised Catholic and went to bible school until 12th grade. I had a nice childhood. I was never approached or told not to believe in God. I think after some time, I realized, like any rational human, that the teachings in this version of the bible, match up neither to other religions, nor to history. I should note that the preists at my church were very cool guys. Easy to talk to, insightful, and never really disagreed, kind of like a psychologist. \n \n However, rationally I came to realize that:\n \n 1. As much as we all want to know that there is someone taking care of us, some justice in the world, something waiting for us after death, there has never once been a shred of proof that anything like this exists. Just like psychics, UFOs, etc. All things that we'd love to take part in, but only exist in our minds. I want so dearly to believe in these things, but there simply is no reason to, if there was, we'd have found it. Is hope good? Yes. Is blind belief in the irrational? No.\n \n 2. Why so many religions in the world today? Conflicting religions. Where was Christianity before Christ? Why were our ancestors worshiping completely different gods? Who's right, who's wrong? Without any evidence, it all points again to #1 again.\n \n 3. Why does the world seem to operate on natural laws and not with some higher purpose? Why is the world basically what we make of it? Why does prayer not actually do anything, yet so many people think it has an impact on the physical world? Why do Churches ask for your money? Why does the catholic church discriminate against women? Why do preachers say one thing, yet do another?\n \n That's, in part, how I came to not believe in something that you have no business believing in.\n \n Why the attacks. Well, that stems from two main reasons:\n \n 1. I can't stand seeing people being taken advantage of, I want people to be self-empowered so that they can be independant, and not to do what other people tell them to do, or think like other people tell them to think. My life is so much more clear and fulfilling without the burden of other people trying to impose their will upon me, and I feel like so many religious folk are being taken advantage of. I also feel pity for their ignorance.\n \n 2. I'm scared of religious fundamentalists and what they represent. The minute you let anyone else tell you what's right or wrong, you're a sheep. And I'm scared of an evil shepard with a huge flock of sheep doing his bidding. Because indeed, that's what they are doing. The work of another HUMAN, not the divine. And people with mass power that do not rely on logic or reason, always seem to do scary things, certainly things that serve their own interests, and not the flock they wield. Just like, well anyone with power.\n \n A third:\n I think our society is distracted by religion and isn't able to focus on the real issues of the world with this cloud of religion obscuring the way.\n \n That's all I have time for, certainly more if you need it ;)\n \n Consider giving up following someone else's desires (humans), to leading yourself. You can still use some christian teachings as your guide, but do so because you feel it's right, not for the promise of an afterlife, or to please your congregation, or because some book someone wrote said to. I feel, in part, that doing good as a free mind is more important than just doing good because somene else asked you to. \n \n If Jesus shows up, given what I learned about him, he'd be pleased to have you join up with him if you were a good person. To think he'd damn you to hell because you chose to not listen to other humans, is...not consistent with the way I use to envision Jesus. But that will never happen of course, which is why you shouldn't entertain the thoughts that other people put in your head. Yes I realize you have to work harder to be an independant thinker...but aren't you up for a challenge?\n \n -Mach",

However, check out my signature line. It is from a man who went to the jungles of south america to bring God to the people there. They killed him. His wife late met the same tribesmen who killed her husband and they now revere her. Why? Because she loved them. She forgave them. She did what her husband risked his life to do. You see, if you believe that you will never die because God has got your back then you do things that most of the world might consider insane. You risk your physical life because you know your eternal life is eternally secure. You no longer worry for the 80 or so years on this planet as they are nothing compared to eternity.",

You believe you have 'an answer' and you want to impart this. Same with Christians. The difference being that you are imparting the view of an individual, and equating this as being the same as someone who is imparting the views of 2,000 years of teaching, and thousands of great thinkers. I would see this as a distorted view - equating the two.\n \n2. I'm scared of religious fundamentalists and what they represent.

Or to lean on the scientific acceptance of something, a test that I can repeat myself or observe myself that supports whatever the hypothesis is. Bascially, proof :). Not to be annoying, but most words have no meaning when we boil them down philosophically, we have to set a bar and work from there.

Conversely is there a need to be atheistic?\n\n \n It's not just the evolutionary theorists, it's human psychology. When faced with the unknown, humans tend to make it up for comfort, but possibly also unconciously for protection. I.e. fear of the unknown , if our ancestors with that trait stayed alive more on average lead to being more \"fit\", etc. We can piece together a lot of it, but we aren't able to point to specifics yet on these types of things, and maybe never will. And yes, maybe... mathematics seems to be a \"pure\" language, and it leads one to be an atheist, since ther is nothing that indicates anything is influenced by some all powerful creator(s). But that's not the primary influence for me. Althought thanks for pointing it out ;)\n \n \nDo you think atheistic North Korea presents a better alternative? Many atheistic regimes exist that are not examples of paradise.\n\n \n What does religion have to do with government? Watch it...this is one of those sticking points that enrages...they have nothing to do with one another..freedom, don't tell anyone what to believe in as a goverment. A government that preaches religion in any form, atheistic or otherwise, is contrary to what America strives for. The government is just a bunch of humans, why would they be allowed to push their personal views on others? Our government should serve us, not the other way around.\n \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/rel_comp.htm\n \n We are one of the most religious, industrialized nations. That embarasses me personally. <35% believe in evolution? Gah...why do you even go to the doctor to get treated? Just go pray on it if you don't believe in \"science\". Don't let others push you around. Why? Because when left to our own devices, we humans tend to push others in a way that benefits US most. That's why a capitalistic society, such as ours, works so well. It ACCEPTS this fundamental human nature, and doesn't try to bend or twist it or deny it. ACCEPTANCE, leads to channeling it to what we think of, in our brief moments of sanity, as the greater good.\n \n I would say that religious belief in this country hurts our nation. However, our capitalistic society and democratic rule are more than enough to overcome most of the damage it might do. And why? Capitalistic society and democracy are more like the natural world. They don't try to limit, the set guidelines and let the market, or the masses, guide the ship. This, is very anti-religious. So yes, I think our country is a good example that non-religious ways of ruling work well. As far as what the population believes..that's just a lack of education IMO. And in a way a result of a captialistic (evolutionary) economy. What would someone who is poised to make millions from consumers want in a consumer? Sheep. They like to keep the masses...controllable. No, not a big consipiracy, an obvious fact of life. That's why we just need to channel it into something we all think is good (better quality of life, more personal freedoms, more safety, etc.)\n \n \n \nThen what is right, is relative. How do you argue with a person who has opposing views on morality? After all, his/her sense of right is equal then, to your own.\n\n \n Exactly. You understand the concept, you just don't like accepting it's conclusions, but that's human too, don't take it hard. It takes some getting use to, but it's correct. There is no morality, it's relative. And that's EXACTLY why we have laws and rule our country through a democracy. Not because it's \"right\", or \"the best\", it's because it WORKS. And on average, people agree it works, to some degree. Morality is primarily a social code, and enforced socially (Which is a huge force..don't underestimate it!). Laws govern our land, and they AREN'T relative. When the supreme court rules, it's final (until maybe later). There is a system in place, and if it doesn't work right, we tweak it, until what the public perceives as the \"greater good\", is met. Not one person's view of the greater good, the overall view...devoid of anything that violates our basic granted rights to life, liberty, etc.\n \n I don't want a \"moral society that rules through the word of God\".\n I want laws and reasons to rule, and let people decide the rest. All people, not just a few of \"god's chosen\", etc. The minute you put one way of thinking into \"power\" you get problems.\n \n \nWell, when Jesus does show up, everyone will know.\n Further to that, I don't believe that 'independent thinking' is all that it might appear. You and I may think we act independently, but there's lots of other factors at work; including social influences, cultural biases, educational standards etc. I see it as no great thing that someone would set themselves up as their own Pope. One of the first steps to wisdom is to realise just how little one knows, or can know. No man is an island, anyway, so I am happy to have help. I'm not too proud to admit that others know more in many areas. That I defer to their wisdom makes me no less a man for doing so.\n\n \n I agree, humility is a good trait to have when it comes to learning. Start by assuming you know nothing, so you can evaluate information with as little bias as possible, so that your conclusions are less biased..and likely more accurate. It has served me well in my own life.\n \n I don't mean think independantly as in \"think by myself\". I mean, do the THINKING and EVALUATING yourself, but certainly rely on the vast amounts of information provided to us not only from the world's present and past population, but also from the universe itself.\n \n That's where most religions fall short. They accept only a very narrow band of information and interpereation (whatever fits their ideas), and discards the rest. Being an \"independant thinker\", does not imply you think alone. Only that you use all information and make the decision yourself. Don't let someone else tell you what information is right or wrong, or what information you're allowed to process, etc. Religions evolve along with everything else in culture..which is ironic, because they often profess to be \"correct\", and \"unchanging\". Much of Christianity is just based off previous religions that it absorbed or overshadowed. The holidays, the rituals...not that there is anything wrong with not \"reinventing the wheel\". That's effiicient...but it sure as he** isn't divine.\n \n -Mach",

Watch it...this is one of those sticking points that enrages...they have nothing to do with one another..freedom, don't tell anyone what to believe in as a government. A government that preaches religion in any form, atheistic or otherwise, is contrary to what America strives for. The government is just a bunch of humans, why would they be allowed to push their personal views on others? Our government should serve us, not the other way around.\n http://www.religioustolerance.org/rel_comp.htm \n\n It's just that you seemed to suggest that religions screw people up. I wanted to point out some systems where atheism's done the same.\n \nWe are one of the most religious, industrialized nations. That embarrasses me personally. <35% believe in evolution? Gah...why do you even go to the doctor to get treated? Just go pray on it if you don't believe in \"science\". Don't let others push you around. Why? Because when left to our own devices, we humans tend to push others in a way that benefits US most. That's why a capitalistic society, such as ours, works so well. It ACCEPTS this fundamental human nature, and doesn't try to bend or twist it or deny it. ACCEPTANCE, leads to channelling it to what we think of, in our brief moments of sanity, as the greater good.\n\n There's a fallacy to your reasoning here. There is no reason that says I should accept everything that scientists say... if I accept some things that they say. Just because I have modern medicines does not mean I have to believe in evolution. It's not a 'package', especially as there are so many different evolutionary theories, and even within what you call 'the theory of evoltion', there are many different and competing ideas, some of which are mutually exclusive.\n Do you think that all the laws of your nation are acceptable? Surely you must, if you obey one of them! (that is your logic at work). It's a major and common fallacy from the atheistic camp, and it has an air of arrogance about it. It's like saying \"You accept our air-conditioners, and microwaves, but you don't accept our evolutionary theory' as if science has bequeathed a whole lot of gifts onto we mere mortals, and we've rejected some of these like badly behaved school-kids; not listening to those who know better than us - because they can make a neat sound system.\n Most scientists accept the need for morals which science does not give.\n \nI would say that religious belief in this country hurts our nation. However, our capitalistic society and democratic rule are more than enough to overcome most of the damage it might do. And why? Capitalistic society and democracy are more like the natural world. They don't try to limit, the set guidelines and let the market, or the masses, guide the ship. This, is very anti-religious. So yes, I think our country is a good example that non-religious ways of ruling work well. As far as what the population believes..that's just a lack of education IMO. And in a way a result of a capitalistic (evolutionary) economy. What would someone who is poised to make millions from consumers want in a consumer? Sheep. They like to keep the masses...controllable. No, not a big conspiracy, an obvious fact of life. That's why we just need to channel it into something we all think is good (better quality of life, more personal freedoms, more safety, etc.)\n\n A Marxist would argue that Capitalism is against nature... hence their version of evolutionary theory supports their a priori notions about what is natural.\n \nThen what is right, is relative. How do you argue with a person who has opposing views on morality? After all, his/her sense of right is equal then, to your own. \n\n \nExactly. You understand the concept, you just don't like accepting it's conclusions, but that's human too, don't take it hard. It takes some getting use to, but it's correct. There is no morality, it's relative. And that's EXACTLY why we have laws and rule our country through a democracy. Not because it's \"right\", or \"the best\", it's because it WORKS. And on average, people agree it works, to some degree. Morality is primarily a social code, and enforced socially (Which is a huge force..don't underestimate it!). Laws govern our land, and they AREN'T relative. When the supreme court rules, it's final (until maybe later). There is a system in place, and if it doesn't work right, we tweak it, until what the public perceives as the \"greater good\", is met. Not one person's view of the greater good, the overall view...devoid of anything that violates our basic granted rights to life, liberty, etc.\n\n So then you really must accept all the laws of your nation. How does one change a law? How was slavery abolished, for example? The laws 'worked'. What right did anyone have to tell people to give up their slaves? The right of force solved the issue - is that now to be the determiner?\n \nI don't want a \"moral society that rules through the word of God\".\n I want laws and reasons to rule, and let people decide the rest. All people, not just a few of \"god's chosen\", etc. The minute you put one way of thinking into \"power\" you get problems.\n\n So you don't think people in power could be worse than God in power?\n \n Well, when Jesus does show up, everyone will know.\n Further to that, I don't believe that 'independent thinking' is all that it might appear. You and I may think we act independently, but there's lots of other factors at work; including social influences, cultural biases, educational standards etc. I see it as no great thing that someone would set themselves up as their own Pope. One of the first steps to wisdom is to realise just how little one knows, or can know. No man is an island, anyway, so I am happy to have help. I'm not too proud to admit that others know more in many areas. That I defer to their wisdom makes me no less a man for doing so.\n\n \nI agree, humility is a good trait to have when it comes to learning. Start by assuming you know nothing, so you can evaluate information with as little bias as possible, so that your conclusions are less biased..and likely more accurate. It has served me well in my own life.\n I don't mean think independently as in \"think by myself\". I mean, do the THINKING and EVALUATING yourself, but certainly rely on the vast amounts of information provided to us not only from the world's present and past population, but also from the universe itself.\n That's where most religions fall short. They accept only a very narrow band of information and interpretation (whatever fits their ideas), and discards the rest. Being an \"independent thinker\", does not imply you think alone. Only that you use all information and make the decision yourself. Don't let someone else tell you what information is right or wrong, or what information you're allowed to process, etc. Religions evolve along with everything else in culture..which is ironic, because they often profess to be \"correct\", and \"unchanging\". Much of Christianity is just based off previous religions that it absorbed or overshadowed. The holidays, the rituals...not that there is anything wrong with not \"reinventing the wheel\". That's efficient...but it sure as he** isn't divine.\n\n My religion, to use your terminology 'works', though I don't follow it due to functional reasons... that is in fact Marxist thinking.",

   "No problem. But it does seem that if evolutionists can equate a need for religion, they also need find an evolutionary need for their own beliefs.\n\n Of course there probably is. What does this have to do with anything? I'd say that \"reason\" has been an incredible boost in being \"fit\" in evolutionary terms. Curiosity also plays a role. Not sure how this helps show anything positive about religion when placed next to science. I don't care if I win or lose whatever point this is, it's irrelevant.\n \n \nThere's a fallacy to your reasoning here. There is no reason that says I should accept everything that scientists say... if I accept some things that they say. Just because I have modern medicines does not mean I have to believe in evolution. It's not a 'package', especially as there are so many different evolutionary theories, and even within what you call 'the theory of evoltion', there are many different and competing ideas, some of which are mutually exclusive.\n\n \n Fallacy..no, I'm not implying one specific logical arugment there.\n And no, you cannot choose to believe in things (generally speaking) just \"because\". It's a process.\n \n William Clifford (Ethics of Belief)\n http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/w_k_clifford/ethics_of_belief.html\n \n Paraphrased/Summarized:\n \n It's wrong to believe in something on insufficient evidence.\n \n And to that, I agree that it's also wrong to NOT believe in something when presented with SUFFICENT evidence.\n \n \"We may believe a statement from another person, when there is reasonable grounds for supposing that he knows the matter of which he speaks, and that he is speaking the truth so far as he knows it.\"\n \n I have reason to believe in \"Mainstream\" science, I do not have reason to believe in a religious preacher when he comments on prayers making a measurable difference in the real world...\n \n And yes, it's a package deal if you accept those. You can't juse say \"well I don't believe that\", and exepect to be taken seriously.\n \n \nDo you think that all the laws of your nation are acceptable? Surely you must, if you obey one of them! (that is your logic at work). \n \n Not my logic, you're putting words into my text. Laws don't require \"acceptance\". They are simply laws. You break one, you're a law-breaker. You don't, you didn't break a law. What's confusing you about that? Obeying them all the time, or part of the time, has no bearing on what is or isn't a law, acceptance or defiance, belief or non-belief.\n \n \nIt's a major and common fallacy from the atheistic camp, and it has an air of arrogance about it. It's like saying \"You accept our air-conditioners, and microwaves, but you don't accept our evolutionary theory' as if science has bequeathed a whole lot of gifts onto we mere mortals, and we've rejected some of these like badly behaved school-kids; not listening to those who know better than us - because they can make a neat sound system.\n Most scientists accept the need for morals which science does not give.\n\n \n Fallacy? You throw that word around a lot for someone who believes without cause. And the \"atheistic camp\" doesn't, to my knowledge, say you have to believe in all theories, that would probably be more like \"the scientific community\", if you wanted to broadly label some group. You DO have to believe in the process, and if you choose not to accept the theory, you need to have some evidence or \"reason\" to ignore the evidence in favor of said theory. If you don't, you're just making things up.\n \n All the \"mere mortals\", and baldy behaved talk, is negative smearing of a general group of people, not helping oh christian-one!\n \n Science accepts EVERYONE, and anyone, as long as you play by the rules, which anyone \"can\" concievably do. If you reason your way to conclusions, all-aboard! Yes, even gays can perform science...gah! And criminals! Oh-my, and relgious people too! What next?\n \n \nA Marxist would argue that Capitalism is against nature... hence their version of evolutionary theory supports their a priori notions about what is natural.\n\n \n Montalbaln, you can find one person to disagree with probably any theory that has ever been forumulated. So by your illogic, nothing can be correct? While philosophically we all understand that concept, it doesn't help solve human, real world problems. Does it? Stare at the sun and it burns your eyes out. You suggest that if someone disagrees, then it's not true. Yet you know, that there seems to be this persistent \"reality\" that can actually be examined, and defined. We could go round and round about marxist views, but that's off-subject.\n \n \nSo then you really must accept all the laws of your nation. How does one change a law? How was slavery abolished, for example? The laws 'worked'. What right did anyone have to tell people to give up their slaves? The right of force solved the issue - is that now to be the determiner?\n\n What is this acceptance you speak of again? It has no relevance here. Our government has clearly defined ways of how bills can become laws, and how ammendments to the consitution are drafted and approved. Why are you trying to mix up acceptance with laws? If you break a law, you broke a law. You didn't do anything immoral, and you didn't \"not accept\" the law, whatever that means. You just, broke a law. See how one relies on a relative viewpoint, and the other is...for the most part, absolute? I accept speed limits, but I break them on occassion, sometimes consciously, sometimes accidentally. Neither have anything to do with accepting a law.\n \n \nSo you don't think people in power could be worse than God in power?\n\n \n Last I checked, God has yet to show up for work. So you're asking me, if I think people \"in power (over humanity)\" can be better than or worse than \"God\" who we have no proof in this natural world of? Um...yes? See how crazy that sounds? \n \n If you mean \"religion\" in power, you must mean PEOPLE/HUMANS in power...which again, I disagree with. My vote goes for a democracy rather than an...what's that again? A theocracy? You bet. I'm not in favor of a theocracy, are you? That's another debate ;)\n \n -Mach",

How would the interest be figured? Why on earth would someone be that crazy to pay at that time in the first place? \n \n Now, jump to the here and now.\n If I had a friend come over to my house and break a vase, I wouldn't dream of asking or expecting them to pay for it. If that person were really someone I considered to be my friend, I would call it an accident and let it go at that.\n If my friend were to insist upon paying for it, I then feel guilty for them dishing out their hard earned dollars for a stupid object. NOW is when our friendship could no longer be repaired. \n I probably don't know where I picked up that vase, I'm not sure I even really liked it in the first place. I probably had it lying around the house out of some obligation I felt for the person who most likely gave me that vase. \n Things are things, my friendships are much more personal. I can replace a vase if I so wish, but my friends I cannot. \n \n If Jesus died for MY sins, that only makes me feel that God doesn't trust me very much and well who really cares anyway? I might as well just go ahead and sin, since God doesn't have all that much faith in his own creations. \n That's like if I were to tell my child to not bother going to school because I know he's really not going to amount to anything anyway. What would stop him then from doing drugs, having unprotected sex, becoming a thief...etc? What motivation would he have to strive for anything more? \n Jesus dieing for my sins way back when sends me a message that God really doesn't expect us to NOT Sin. So what's humankind's motivation not to? \n NONE",

   "Perhaps the problem is that an accident like this is not an appropriate analogy. Sin is not exactly an accident. Usually, behavior that rises to the level of sin is intentional. A better analogy might be if you discovered that your friend broke the vase on purpose and lied about it.\n\n \n \n Now see, I have yet another problem with that. If I found out my friend lied about breaking my vase on purpose, the friendship would forever be damaged no matter how much my friend repayed the purchase price. That lie would always be there, lurking around. \n The shear knowledge that I could never again trust the person I once called my friend, would forever damage that relationship. \n That person would have to pay over and over again and again, in deeds that may aid in him proving he was again reliable and worthy of my friendship.\n \n But see, Jesus dieing as a payment is ludicris in my mind mainly because he did so thousands of years ago for sins I may or may not commit in the future. That's just plain crazy. \n Saying that God is omnipotent and knows we will all commit sin is simply negating the idea that we were all given free will.",

I got distracted on the Civil Rights debate.\n \n Many of us who believe in God have experienced God; miracles etc. Oddly enough one of the first things people in your camp will try to do is to disprove or down-play these beliefs BECAUSE of the lack of scientific evidence, so they give a hierarchy to experiences - with only the experiences they believe in being justified (even when there's no scientific evidence).\n \n I feel God's love.\n \n As for love.

   "Of course it is! If your life revovles around the \"Worth\" of stuff, and you do not value the friendships you have, you are blind! A vase vs a human life? Duh! \n \n Funny enough I had a colbalt candle holder and it was very important to me for some many reasons. One of my friends was over who talks mostly with his mouth but second to his hands going wuuush! and wuuush went the candle holder. My immediate reaction was that I was ******, I yelled at my friend and blamed him for being careless. I was upset the candle holder was gone, done, shattered! A few days went by and he stopped by with a concerned look and his head down! I gave him a hug and a big kiss and told him I was glad to see him! The candle holder is still imprtant to me to this day! I know exactly what is looked like and where I got it (an-ex) and why it was important, but It is ok with me that it is gone! Was tired of dusting the damn thing anyway! Stuff is just stuff!! Take it, as long as you leave me as I am!\n\n \n The point of my analogy is this, God believes that His relationship with us is more important than the wrongness that is in us. God did not create us to deal with the problem of sin. We were allowed to sin in order that the love of God could be demonstrated. It is a free will issue. Regardless if Big Orn doesn't want me to bring that out, he doesn't get to decide that something is non topical just because it screws up his argument. It is applicable because accidents happen due to carelessness. Carelessness is not simply a whoops, it is an intentional decision to not pay attention. Not an intentional decision to break the vase perhaps, but a decison to not pay attention to prevent something like that in the first place.\n \n So: Justincredible: God does not trust you.

   "To Dzeron:\n The main problem I find with Christianity is the very idea of the Bible itself. The whole idea of an \"unquestionable book\" is not only preposterous, but it is actually harmful for the human race. It puts constraints on free thought.\n \n And stating that the idea of an unquestionable book is not only preposterous but it is actually harmful for the human race is not constrainting free throught?? What you are saying - if I understand you correctly here - is that you don't like Christianity and the Bible because it is \"intolerant\" of other religious views and books, yes? Are you saying that we should all be tolerant of all views? \n \n For example, my view is that the literal interpretation of Genesis and the fact that the Bible is 100% true is the right view and all other views concerning the origin of life, for example, are wrong. Will you tolerate my view?\n \n You may be thinking something along the lines of: If I say yes, then I've allowed him to say you can't have another view such as mine; if I say no, then I've obviously been intolerant of his view - what do I do? You may also be thinking that I cannot be dogmatic like this. But that thought in itself is a dogmatic statement.\n \n You'll be interested to know that at one time, a group called \"Toleration\" began. They were insisting on a tolerance of all religious ways, beliefs and customs. They said that we had to stop intolerance in society. In their promotional leaflet explaining their viewpoint, it was interesting that they listed all the things they were against. And most of the things of which they were intolerant of were related to Christianity - which is contradictory to what they were saying, i.e. be tolerant of everything. What they really meant was that they wanted a tolerance of anything in society, except Christianity! \n \n The idea of open-mindedness comes from the notion that there is no such thing as absolute truth, or that truth cannot be absolutely known. Some say, \"There are no absolutes\". Ironically, this premise has become their one absolute. Such ideas are derived from an anti-Biblical philosophy which holds that everything is relative. Christian absolutes - those truths and standards of Scripture which cannot be altered - are becoming less and less tolerated in society. Our society is now based on a relative morality: that is, a person can do what he or she likes and is answerable to no one but himself as long as the majority of people can be persuaded that their interests are not being threatened. This results in society's being told taht no one can say anything against those who do whatever they want to (within limits of the law, which is also changing to become more tolerant of people's actions).\n \n It is not the purpose of faith to dictate that certain ideas in politics, ethics, metaphysics, or science are the absolute truth and anyone who questions them will be punished. Faith is a filler for things science cannot likely determine, such as what happens after you die. But if such things become known by reason, faith must back down.\n \n In actual fact, God's absolutes dictate that there are rules by which we must abide, especially relating to behaviour, law, morals and ethics. Break the rules and you will be punished accordingly. No one who questions Christianity is punished or ever was punished to my knowledge. Christianity cannot co-exist in a world community with relative morality as its basis.\n \n Your own argument that \"faith is a filler for things science cannot likely determine\" works against you. Someone had to believe by blind faith that radio signals could travel through buildings before it was actually tested experimentally and found to be true. Someone had to believe by faith that we could one day put people on the moon, erase many deadly diseases. The quote \"Believers make things happen\" is from the Cancer Council, this is where I got the idea for this argument from. They believe that cancer can be beaten, and in time, it will be. Thus faith is not a filler for things science is unlikely to determine.\n \n There have been some things to think about -- sorry about the length.",

   "To montalban:\n Crimes have been committed by non-religious people too. Anyone want to visit secular North Korea?\n \n So sad but true. We get some booklets from \"The Bible League\" that describe the situation of our brothers and sisters over seas in anti-Christian countries. The Bible league works very hard to provide Bibles in these countries to persecuted Christians, such as China and North Korea as you mentioned. In the recent booklet \"The Rock of Refuge\" it states:\n \"More than 200 million Christians worldwide are hunted, imprisoned, banished, fined, denied jobs and education, physically tortured and brutally killed - just because they are Christians. But they consider themselves blessed! God has given them the privilege to follow the way of the cross. They have experienced His abundant grace in times of trouble.\"\n \n Amazing people, amazing Christians - I wish that one day I will be half as faithful and as good as them.\n \n Using North Korea as an example:\n \"Christians in North Korea rank at the very top of the world's \"most persecuted\" lists. \"Paul\" was one of the key perpetrators. As an undercover agent, he infiltrated groups of Christians, turning them over to authorities to be tortured and killed. He was amazed at their endurance. \"They didn't scream. They didn't curse us. They just kept repeating the word Joo-Eou (Lord) over and over, like a prayer. No matter what torture we applied, they would not deny their Lord. Not even in death.\" Praise the Lord that \"Paul\" is now a committed Christian and shares God's love with others, he humbly says, \"I am so unworthy...\"\"\n \n These Christians are being completely in line with their faith, for example: \"Love thy enemies\". The thing about secularism in general, is that there is no \"right\" or \"wrong\". This is because there is no God to set the absolutes and the rules as well as absolute morals. These secularists are being completely in-line with their faith. They don't consider what they are doing to be \"wrong\". \n \n Christians are to live up to the absolute standards that God gave us - this is typically one of the things that seperates us from many atheists. Christianity says \"God is love\", \"love one another\" and \"love your enemies\". Such love is self-sacrificing. Consequently, Christians have been at the forefront in helping the sick, looking after the orphaned and the aged, feeding the hungry, educating the poor, and opposing exploitation through such things as child labour and slavery. \n \n Atheism, with its evolutionary rationale, says \"love\" is nothing more than self-interest in increasing teh chances of our genes surviving in our offspring or our close relatives. In the \"struggle for survival of th efittest\", where is the basis for compassion?\n \n I'm not saying that atheists can't or don't love, have compassion and so on, but they have no basis to do so. They are all obviously capable of displaying compassion in one form or another, but they have no basis for it. I'm already off topic so I'll shut up now, as a matter of fact, I've forgotten where I was going with this... emoticon_emb (I hate it when that happens!)

   "Since you asked, montalban...\n \n I don't attack or disparage Christ. Or scripture. Indeed, I believe all of scripture God-breathed, true in what it affirms, free of error in the autographous versions, and useful in all the ways Paul said it is. I do not disparage faith, but treasure it, and love the evangelical church I belong to, and the Christian church at large.\n \n I do, however, despise my religion. I despise that religion in so far as the words and deeds of certain of its members who misuse scripture to assert that their interpretations, and their normative prescriptions, are uniquely correct...who assert that Christ and God are fully apprehended in their uniquely correct (and overwhelmingly male) interpretation...who use scripture to censor that with which they disagree...who twist scripture and the flag together in an ungodly, hyper-patriotic rope...who use scripture to oppress women, or elevate their own culture over others...and, most especially, who, more than disagreeing with, actively suppress alternative theological opinion.\n \n Contemporary conservative American Christianity is day by day ever more embarrassing itself, and estranging intelligent, literate folk whom it ought to attract. \n \n That, in a nutshell, is why I, a Christian, attack Christianity.\n \n Cheers, and God bless...\n \n Bradley",

The Bible, the old testament, has no real problem with slavery-btw.\n Right after Moses was given the 10 cmdmts:\n \nExodus 21\n 1 \"These are the laws you are to set before them:\n 2 \"If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is to serve you for six years. But in the seventh year, he shall go free, without paying anything. 3 If he comes alone, he is to go free alone; but if he has a wife when he comes, she is to go with him. 4 If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the woman and her children shall belong to her master, and only the man shall go free.\n 5 \"But if the servant declares, 'I love my master and my wife and children and do not want to go free,' 6 then his master must take him before the judges. [1] He shall take him to the door or the doorpost and pierce his ear with an awl. Then he will be his servant for life.\n 7 \"If a man sells his daughter as a servant, she is not to go free as menservants do. 8 If she does not please the master who has selected her for himself, [2] he must let her be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to foreigners, because he has broken faith with her. 9 If he selects her for his son, he must grant her the rights of a daughter. 10 If he marries another woman, he must not deprive the first one of her food, clothing and marital rights. 11 If he does not provide her with these three things, she is to go free, without any payment of money. \n\n But, that's just one part. There are other parts that tell you to only take slaves if they are your enemy. There are other parts that make slavery sound like a punishment or a bad thing, but don't say it's forbidden. Just like the Bible on so many issues, it's very vague and confusing.\n \n \nAtheism, with its evolutionary rationale, says \"love\" is nothing more than self-interest in increasing teh chances of our genes surviving in our offspring or our close relatives. In the \"struggle for survival of th efittest\", where is the basis for compassion?\n\n Athiests don't go to athiest church to be told what to believe. Some may believe these things, but I'm sure most don't. You don't need a basis for compassion beyond feeling compassion. No religion is going to MAKE you feel it. You either feel it or you don't. You either feel love or you don't, no matter what god you do or don't believe in.\n \n \nI'm not saying that atheists can't or don't love, have compassion and so on, but they have no basis to do so.

If they don't feel it, then it doesn't matter how many books say that you have to feel it. If morals need a basis, then we should look to their natural sources. Where does altruism come from?

   "Firstly, why does atheism rest on evolutionary rationale? I agree that most atheists reject God and Christianity due to a higher value placed on a scientific education, but the theory of evolution itself is only one small piece in the puzzle.\n \n I've posted this before, but IMHO, the display of compassion, love etc... by the atheist is by far the more noble of acts, for the atheist has no reason for doing these things. No heavenly reward, no fear of an angry God, only the reward of the act itself.\n \n There is a basis for it, but it has nothing to do with supernatural causes, only the desire to be happy, loved, etc... and to see others happy, loved etc... No more, no less, no supernatural reward, no supernatural punishment, only human to human contact purely for the rewards of the here and now, and ultimately I suppose, for the good of all humankind.\n \n Waxy\n\n \n This is so well said.

They are not worried about the protections of their fellow man. they are concerned only for themselves.\n \n Mormans are ex-communicated if they do something considered a sin and refuse to repent.

   "To Dzeron:\n The main problem I find with Christianity is the very idea of the Bible itself. The whole idea of an \"unquestionable book\" is not only preposterous, but it is actually harmful for the human race. It puts constraints on free thought.\n \n And stating that the idea of an unquestionable book is not only preposterous but it is actually harmful for the human race is not constrainting free throught?? What you are saying - if I understand you correctly here - is that you don't like Christianity and the Bible because it is \"intolerant\" of other religious views and books, yes? Are you saying that we should all be tolerant of all views? \n \n For example, my view is that the literal interpretation of Genesis and the fact that the Bible is 100% true is the right view and all other views concerning the origin of life, for example, are wrong. Will you tolerate my view?\n \n You may be thinking something along the lines of: If I say yes, then I've allowed him to say you can't have another view such as mine; if I say no, then I've obviously been intolerant of his view - what do I do? You may also be thinking that I cannot be dogmatic like this. But that thought in itself is a dogmatic statement.\n \n You'll be interested to know that at one time, a group called \"Toleration\" began. They were insisting on a tolerance of all religious ways, beliefs and customs. They said that we had to stop intolerance in society. In their promotional leaflet explaining their viewpoint, it was interesting that they listed all the things they were against. And most of the things of which they were intolerant of were related to Christianity - which is contradictory to what they were saying, i.e. be tolerant of everything. What they really meant was that they wanted a tolerance of anything in society, except Christianity! \n \n The idea of open-mindedness comes from the notion that there is no such thing as absolute truth, or that truth cannot be absolutely known. Some say, \"There are no absolutes\". Ironically, this premise has become their one absolute. Such ideas are derived from an anti-Biblical philosophy which holds that everything is relative. Christian absolutes - those truths and standards of Scripture which cannot be altered - are becoming less and less tolerated in society. Our society is now based on a relative morality: that is, a person can do what he or she likes and is answerable to no one but himself as long as the majority of people can be persuaded that their interests are not being threatened. This results in society's being told taht no one can say anything against those who do whatever they want to (within limits of the law, which is also changing to become more tolerant of people's actions).\n \n It is not the purpose of faith to dictate that certain ideas in politics, ethics, metaphysics, or science are the absolute truth and anyone who questions them will be punished. Faith is a filler for things science cannot likely determine, such as what happens after you die. But if such things become known by reason, faith must back down.\n \n In actual fact, God's absolutes dictate that there are rules by which we must abide, especially relating to behaviour, law, morals and ethics. Break the rules and you will be punished accordingly. No one who questions Christianity is punished or ever was punished to my knowledge. Christianity cannot co-exist in a world community with relative morality as its basis.\n \n Your own argument that \"faith is a filler for things science cannot likely determine\" works against you. Someone had to believe by blind faith that radio signals could travel through buildings before it was actually tested experimentally and found to be true. Someone had to believe by faith that we could one day put people on the moon, erase many deadly diseases. The quote \"Believers make things happen\" is from the Cancer Council, this is where I got the idea for this argument from. They believe that cancer can be beaten, and in time, it will be. Thus faith is not a filler for things science is unlikely to determine.\n \n There have been some things to think about -- sorry about the length.\n\n \n First of all, I do not suggest that all views need to be accepted. I don't know where you got that assumption. Some views (like that of the unquestionable book) are often ridiculous, contradictory, nazi-sounding or even downright false. Certain ideas must be freely discarded, as well as created, by society on an individual basis - not by force, but rather by argument. I believe this is called Hegel's dialectic.\n \n And claiming that hypotheses are faith-based, so therefore faith is authoritative, is equally absurd. The differences between hypotheses and religion is that hypotheses are recognized for what they are - guesswork while religion skips the experimentation steps and claims that its guesses are automatically true. And another point - hypotheses are not \"blind faith\" since the scientist knows that his hypothesis came from his own brain, not from an angry God who will smite him down if he disbelieves, and likewise he knows that his guess is not authoritative.",

   "Im not saying you said this, but its people who do say this that annoys me. Muhammed was not an evil man. In fact he was the one who stopped a bunch of the tribal warfares in the middle east back then. He also gave the middle east a big heads start in advancement. Unlike the people over in England who live in castles in the medieval times, the pople in the middle east were expanding alot. Alot of this was started by Muhammed and that really, REALLY, doesn't sound evil to me. Does it?\n \n\n No, not if what you said was true.

The last messenger of God who brought His last revelation the Holy Quraan to humanity is Muhammad bin 'Abdullah, born in Mekkah, approximately 550 years after Jesus, son of Mary, peace and blessings of God be on them both.

This is only due to the strenuous work done by the scholars of Hadith in this field of study.\"\n http://understanding-islam.org/rela...=319&sscatid=69\n \n C- The Primary Sources showing Aisha was nine when the relationship with Muhammad was consummated\n From Bukhari vol. 7, #65:\n \"Narrated Aisha that the prophet wrote the marriage contract with her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old. Hisham said: \"I have been informed that Aisha remained with the prophet for nine years (i.e. till his death).\"\"\n Bukhari vol. 7, #88:\n \"Narrated Urwa: \"The prophet wrote the (marriage contract) with Aisha while she was six years old and consummated his marriage with her while she was nine years old and she remained with him for nine years (i.e. till his death).\"\"\n Bukhari vol. 5, #234 says:\n \"Narrated Aisha: The prophet engaged me when I was a girl of six. We went to Medina and stayed at the home of Harith Kharzraj. Then I got ill and my hair fell down. Later on my hair grew (again) and my mother, Um Ruman, came to me while I was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became all right, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said, \"Best wishes and Allah's blessing and a good luck.\" Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage). Unexpectedly Allah's messenger came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to him, and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age.\"\n FROM THE HADITH OF SAHIH MUSLIM VOLUME 2, #3309\n Aisha reported: Allah's Messenger married me when I was six years old, and I was admitted to his house at the age of nine\". \n FROM THE HADITH OF THE SUNAN OF ABU DAWUD\n (Abu Dawud's Hadith is the third most respected Hadith in Islam.)\n From Abu Dawud, Vol. 2, #2116:\n \"Aisha said, \"The Apostle of Allah married me when I was seven years old.\" (The narrator Sulaiman said: \"Or six years.\"). \"He had intercourse with me when I was 9 years old.\"\n quoted at an anti-Islamic site...\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Silas/childbrides.htm\n \n BUT\n verifiable by checking\n http://www.quraan.com/index.aspx\n which is an Islamic site that gives Koranic Suras, and Haddiths.\n \n D(j)- Secondary Sources on Aisha's age from the same anti-Islamic site...\n FROM THE HISTORY OF TABARI\n (Tabari wrote the most authentic Islamic history. It covers 39 volumes. Tabari was one of the greatest Islamic scholars and the greatest Islamic Historian.)\n From Tabari, volume 7, page 7:\n \"....my marriage (to Muhammad) was consummated when I was nine.....\"\n From Tabari, volume 9, page 131\n \"Then the men and women got up and left. The Messenger of God consummated his marriage with me in my house when I was nine years old. Neither a camel nor a sheep was slaughtered on behalf of me\"......(The Prophet) married her three years before the Emigration, when she was seven years old and consummated the marriage when she was nine years old, after he had emigrated to Medina in Shawwal. She was eighteen years old when he died.\n (I also want to provide evidence from the best Islamic Ency. available in English, and other Islamic writers. They also acknowledge Aisha's age being 9.)\n FROM THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF ISLAM, under \"Aisha\". (pub. by E.J. Brill). \n \"Some time after the death of Khadija, Khawla suggested to Muhammad that he should marry either Aisha, the 6 year old daughter of his chief follower, or Sawda Zama, a widow of about 30, who had gone as a Muslim to Abyssinia and whose husband had died there. Muhammad is said to have asked her to arrange for him to marry both. It had already been agreed that Aisha should marry Djubayr Mutim, whose father, though still pagan, was friendly to the Muslims. By common consent, however, this agreement was set aside, and Muhammad was betrothed to Aisha.... The marriage was not consummated until some months after the Hidjra, (in April 623, 624). Aisha went to live in an apartment in Muhammad's house, later the mosque of Median. She cannot have been more than ten years old at the time and took her toys to her new home.\"\n From the Muslim book \"WOMEN IN ISLAM\" by Said Abjullah Seif-Al-Hatimy, published by Islamic Publications in Lahore Pakistan:\n \"...(Aisha) She was the youngest of his wives. It is said that she was nine years of age when he married her.\" \n \n also quoted at an anti-Islamic site...\n http://www.answering-islam.org/Silas/childbrides.htm\n \n BUT\n verifable by checking\n http://www.quraan.com/index.aspx\n which is an Islamic site that gives Koranic Suras, and Haddiths.\n \n D(ii)- Further secondary sources....\n \"The Prophet consummated his marriage with A'isha when she was nine and this was considered the age of consent for a long time.\"\n http://www.hraic.org/women_in_islam.html\n also at\n http://www.amcoptic.com/read_for_u/women_and_islam.htm\n \n Muhammad married her when she was six (or engaged to her), and actually took her into his household (and consummated the marriage) when she was nine. However he had told of him 'dreaming' about her when she was 4 or 5!\n Hadith Bukhari 5:58:235.\n \"...[T]he Prophet (Muhammad) said to her (Aisha), 'You have been shown to me twice in my dream. I saw you pictured on a piece of silk and someone said (to me). 'This is your wife.' When I uncovered the picture, I saw that it was yours. I said, 'If this is from Allah, it will be done.'\" \n \n Remember, that she was only a child. He is dreaming about a little girl who was six or under (because she was six at the age of betrothal).\n \n \n E- Expert advice\n (i) When is a girl considered in Islam to be a woman?\n Muslim experts cite that once a girl menstruates, she's marriageable. This is based on the Koran...\n When in Islam is a girl a woman?\n Sura At-Talaaq\n 65:4\n \"And those of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them the 'Iddah (prescribed period), if you have doubts (about their periods), is three months, and for those who have no courses [(i.e. they are still immature) their 'Iddah (prescribed period) is three months likewise, except in case of death] . And for those who are pregnant (whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead), their 'Iddah (prescribed period) is until they deliver (their burdens), and whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make his matter easy for him.\"\n http://www.quraan.com/index.aspx?ta...tabid=27&bid=65\n \n \"Thus, it is part of Islam to acknowledge the coming of puberty as the start of adulthood. It is the time when the person has already matured and is ready the responsibilities of an adult.\"\n http://www.bismikaallahuma.org/Polemics/aishah.htm\n \n \"Islam teaches that female puberty begins when the menses is started. From Bukhari, volume 3, Book of Witnesses, chapter 18, page 513: \"The boy attaining the age of puberty and the validity of their witness and the Statement of Allah: \"And when the children among you attain the age of puberty, then let them also ask for permission (to enter).\" Quran 24:59. Al Mughira said, \"I attained puberty at the age of twelve.\" The attaining of puberty by women is with the start of menses, as is referred to by the Statement of Allah: \"Such of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them prescribed period if you have any doubts (about their periods) is three months... [65:4] ...Al-Hasan bin Salih said, \"I saw a neighbouress of mine who became a grandmother at the age of twenty-one.\" [1] [1] The note for this reference says, \"This women attained puberty at the age of nine and married to give birth to a daughter at ten; the daughter had the same experience.\" My understanding of the above is that Islam considers that when a child \"attains\", or begins, \"puberty\", then he / she is considered an adult. Hence the validity of the witness. Muhammad followed a cultural norm in marrying and having sex with a young girl. After all, she was considered an adult. Not only did he do that, but he taught his followers to do as he did. Therefore is acceptable for Muslim men to marry and have intercourse with girls who have had their menarche. Muhammad established this cultural practice as a precedent in Islam. I add that there are other primitive cultures that allow girls to marry following their menarche. But that does not make it right or in the best interests of the child. Some cultures killed baby daughters for various reasons. Cultural norms do not make an action morally right\"\n http://www.exmuslim.com/com/puberty.htm\n (this is an anti-Muslim site)\n \n E(ii) Actual advice to Muslims by Islamic centres of advice...\n \"According to the Shari'ah, if a girl is a minor (did not attain puberty), she may be given in marriage by her father. When she attains puberty, she has the right to maintain the marriage or discontinue the marriage. There is no age limit to be intimate with one's wife even if she is a minor. \n It is important for you, in your situation, to consider the age difference reservation expressed by your wife. \n and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best \n Mufti Ebrahim Desai\"\n http://islam.tc/ask-imam/view.php?q=6737\n \n Here's some more good Islamic advice...\n The Appropriate Age for Marriage\n Question: What is the appropriate age for men and women to marry? Some of the young ladies of today do not accept to be married to men older than them and also some of the men do not get married from anyone older than them either. We hope for a response, may Allah reward you.\n Response: I advise the young ladies not to refuse a man because of his older age. Even if he be ten, twenty or thirty years older, this is not a valid excuse. The Prophet (peace be upon him) married Aisha when he was fifty-three years old and she was nine years old. Older age is not harmful.\n http://www.uh.edu/campus/msa/articl...rriage.html#age\n \n \"It is the duty of parents to arrange the marriage of their children when they come of age. The Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam has stressed that it should be taken seriously and with a full sense of responsibility. Abu Saeed Khudri and Abdullah ibn Abbas (R.A.) narrated that the Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam said \"Whoever is blessed by the Creator with children should give them good names, a good training, teach them good manners, and arrange for their marriage when they attain the age of puberty. If he does not pay due heed to it and fails to get them married, on reaching marriageable age (due to negligence) and they take to ways that are forbidden, the father will be held responsible for it.\"\n \n http://www.islam.tc/social_conduct/social_conduct_of_a_muslim.html\n \n \n Here's another ruling from another expert site - a site that presents Islamic facts to Moslems...\n Q). I have a nine year-old girl who is married to a person at the age of 20. The marriage contract was made a year ago but the girl is refusing to live with her husband or even to look at him. In addition to that she requires him to divorce her. Could you please advise me what to do? Should I separate them or force my daughter to live with him?\n (Name and address withheld) \n A). It is certainly possible for a father to get his daughter married to someone who he thinks is suitable for her. Whether he should force her into any marriage is something totally different Let me relate this to you: A woman companion of the Prophet came to him and said: \"My father has married me away to one of his relatives without asking my opinion. I do not wish to stay with this man as his wife.\" The Prophet ordered their separation. When she realized that she was free and that she was no longer married to the man, she said to the Prophet: \"I now accept what my father has done and I am marrying this man. I only did this so that women may know that it is not up to men to marry them away against their wishes.\"\n Scholars have discussed at length the marriage of a young girl who has not attained puberty and whether her father may marry her away without her permission. If such a marriage takes place it is valid. However, it is perhaps best if the marriage is not allowed to be consummated until the girl attains puberty, when she is given the choice whether to continue with this marriage or not. Moreover her father may not marry her away to someone who is of a lesser status than hers. If he does and she objects, the marriage is not valid. Generally speaking, however. a girl must be asked to express her opinion in any proposed marriage. If she has been married before, then her verbal consent should be requested. If she has not been married previously, then her consent is also to be requested, but if she keeps quiet, her silence is taken as approval.\n To say that the marriage is valid is not to say that people should go ahead and make such marriages. There may be certain circumstances, which make it desirable or advisable that a very young girl should be married away in this manner but this must not be taken as the normal situation. In marriage, the normal thing is that people should marry when they are of marriageable age. That does not include girls of nine or ten years of age, although some girls may attain puberty that early. Marriage involves certain responsibilities and a very young girl could not be expected to shoulder these. There are also other problems, which the may face, as she grows older. If things go wrong with her marriage, she will always blame her father for having messed up her life, well intentioned though he may be. If you take the example of your own daughter, and you force her to go and live with her husband despite her protestations, you will never be sure whether the marriage will work out well or not. If it does, then well and good. But there is an equal chance that problems may arise especially with your daughter behaving like the child she is. While her husband expects from her the attitude of a married woman. How could you expect her to overcome the feeling that she has been thrown into this situation without being allowed the slightest say in the whole matter which is to affect the rest of her life?\n \n As we see it, your choice is either to get her divorced now, before the marriage is consummated or to keep her with you until she has attained puberty and she is in a position to express her opinion about this marriage. If she still objects to it, then you divorce her without any compulsion to go through with it. If, on the other hand, if she approves of this marriage, at that time, then you go ahead with it. Perhaps it is better for you to consult with the young man to whom you have already married her. He should be understanding and accommodating. Between the two of you should work out the best solution which ensures that he is not lumbered with marriage which is forced on a young girl who cannot be expected to give an opinion about such a matter.\n http://www.islamicvoice.com/august.98/marriage.htm#EAR\n \n This is why there was a dispute about having a mandatory age for consent recently in Nigeria...\n \"Pegging the Marriageable Age The most contentious issue arising from the contents of the 2003 Child Rights Act is the feasibility, or otherwise, of pegging the marriageable age for the female gender by the Government. This appears to offend the culture that prevails in many communities of Northern Nigeria under which young girls are married off at ages between 9 and 16 years. Upon a careful study of the position in Islamic Law, however, it is clear that this culture is one of the many inconsistencies that abound. There is certainly no categorical statement under the Sharia that a female must be married off even after the attainment of puberty, and the emphasis on the pursuit of education seems to be more pronounced, than marriage (which becomes imperative only in the event that the person is incapable of remaining chaste).'\n \n http://allafrica.com/stories/200407200423.html\n \n \n \n F. Is this harmful?\n \n Yes...\n \n \"Fact Sheet No.23, Harmful Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children\n \n Traditional cultural practices reflect values and beliefs held by members of a community for periods often spanning generations. Every social grouping in the world has specific traditional cultural practices and beliefs, some of which are beneficial to all members, while others are harmful to a specific group, such as women. These harmful traditional practices include female genital mutilation (FGM); forced feeding of women; early marriage; the various taboos or practices which prevent women from controlling their own fertility; nutritional taboos and traditional birth practices; son preference and its implications for the status of the girl child; female infanticide; early pregnancy; and dowry price. Despite their harmful nature and their violation of international human rights laws, such practices persist because they are not questioned and take on an aura of morality in the eyes of those practising them.\"\n \n http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu6/2/fs23.htm\n \n Fact Sheet No.23, Harmful Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children\n \"Child marriage robs a girl of her childhood-time necessary to develop physically, emotionally and psychologically. In fact, early marriage inflicts great emotional stress as the young woman is removed from her parents' home to that of her husband and in-laws. Her husband, who will invariably be many years her senior, will have little in common with a young teenager. It is with this strange man that she has to develop an intimate emotional and physical relationship. She is obliged to have intercourse, although physically she might not be fully developed.\"\n \n (Ibid)\n \n \n \n \"Research interest in the long-term effects of sexual contact between female children and adults has increased dramatically in the last two decades. Two sets of issues have driven this enhanced attention. The first concerns the nature and extent of the impact these experiences have on subsequent well-being in adulthood. Empirical research has offered evidence of the severe and wide ranging effects of adult-child sex by documenting its associations with a host of later \"symptoms,\" such as low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and sexual dysfunction.\"\n \n \"Sexual contact between children and adults: A life course perspective.\"\n \n Browning, Christopher R; Laumann, Edward O \n \n Citation: American Sociological Review, v62n4, pp.540-560, Aug 1997 \n \n Number: 03374356 Features: Table; Illustration; References \n \n Copyright: American Sociological Association 1997 \n \n \n quoted at http://www.answering-islam.org/Silas/childbrides.htm",

And contradictions do not exist. Who says it is a contradiction? You do. Your proof? The statement that it is.\n \nThe definition of nature, depends on the current space/time fabric and the laws that govern it. To \"change a law\", changes your definition of natural. So, logically, something cannot \"defy nature\". One cannot \"break\" a law of nature. If you do, it wasn't a law to begin with, the definition was incomplete, and obviously \"not true\".\n\n Super means 'above' Something supernatural need not be bound by nature's laws.\n \nThat's why the definition \"unknowable\", is more precise. Supernatural is BY DEFINITION, outside of nature, beyond human observation in principle. To suggest one can know something that is outside nature, yet observable within nature, is a contradiction.\n -Mach\n I hope that makes sense, if not, I'll attempt a better clarification.\n\n So supernatural = unknowable which doesn't exist?!?\n How can you know this about an unknowable? That it is super-natural.\n Why is it that you believe man is wholly natural and in no part super-natural? Where is your proof?",

That organization didn't coalesce for quite some time. It is important to distinguish between manmade organizations and what protestants call \"the church\". The protestant definition is simply those who are christian. The catholic definition refers specifically to the catholic church organization, at least as far as I understand it.",

Consider the fact that there were no \"Bibles\" around yet, so anyone in authority could justify just about anything in the name of God.\n 3.

Many christians find homosexual behavior to be wrong. They unfortunately take it out on the person. I, as a christian, believe homosexual behavior is wrong, BECAUSE I believe it to be harmful to people. I would never presume to tell someone who is homosexual that God will judge them or any such thing. That is judgement. To hate a person is judgement. To hate what they do, because you don't like its effect on you is understandable but selfish. To hate what someone does, because it is harmful to them, is loving. \n \n This is why I made the comment about intollerance. I am sure that you actually meant the behavior bothered you. But, you should be careful of HOW you state things. Words have meanings for a reason. The way you stated it sounded very intolerant of others beliefs, just because they disagreed with you. What you probably meant was \"that kind of behavior is anoying, and I hate it.\" As a chrisitan, I also hate the kind of behavior you described.

He was a very devout Catholic (he was a 4th degree Knight of Columbus and involved in a huge way in his local parish) as is his immediate family. I was struck by the amount of comfort they took in \"knowing\" that Harry was in heaven with God. There is no doubt in my mind that their faith made his passing much more bearable and somehow acceptable. It gave all of them strength.

Death is final, death is natural, everything dies.\n \n Regardless of whether or not you believe that person is \"alive\" in an afterlife or not, IMHO, that person truly lives on in the memories of those that loved them.\n \n Do you feel that you have control, or more control, over when and how you die because of your belief in God? I don't think that's what you're saying, but in your scenario above, the idiot with the bomb is God in disguise, working in \"mysterious ways\". If that gives you more comfort than just being killed by an idiot, then I guess so be it, but I fail to see the difference beyond that.\n \n I couldn't disagree more with your closing statement. Do you live this life strictly to get to heaven so you can really start to live? What do you live everyday on this earth for? What gets you out of bed? You make a list and I'll make a list, I'll bet dollars to donuts that they are darn near identical.

Wouldn't they know better in that day than in ours?\n \n \nThe problem is that once you start going that direction with a historical figure, you could apply the same thing to many, many people in history that we currently take as having actually lived: Muhammed, many of the Pharoahs (only mentioned in ancient writings), many of the past leaders such as Alexander the Great, etc. \n\n So? Why not do that, then? Lumping all supposed historical figures together is not valid. Some of them may have existed and some of them may not have. Each one stands independently. Just because we accept one does not mean that all of them existed. \n \n If an individual noteworthy figure actually existed in the history of this world, then there should be enough actual evidence to suggest that that noteworthy figure actually existed.

How can we then automatically discount the existence of Jesus based on the fact He is mentioned in an ancient religious text? \n\n You are simplifying the issue by using the word 'automatically' here. I am not suggesting we 'automatically' do anything. I am suggesting that we consider all angles and all points of view -- even if they are not popularly accepted.\n \n If anyone considers the issue from a Christian point of view, it is unlikely that that individual will come to an unbiased conclusion about the historicity of Jesus.

My basis for this opinion rests upon various NT accounts which tend to place Jesus in less than a favourable light (questions raised concerning Jesus' paternity, Jesus insults his mother, Jesus' family considers him to be crazy, Jesus as a follower of John the B., etc.). The problem, as I see it, is in attempting to determine who he was, what he said, and what he did. The nature of this problem becomes apparent when you consider that virtually all of the biblical writings concerning Jesus come from individuals who are not considered to have been eyewitnesses to Jesus' life and times but who were, instead, later followers of Jesus. This is evidenced by the fact that there are various NT descriptions of certain aspects of Jesus' life and of his teachings which cannot be reconciled (birth narratives, visits to Jerusalem, resurrection narratives, paths to salvation, etc.). Add to this the fact that if you read from Paul to John, you will discover a gradual evolution of NT Christology over time. \n \n You can then add to this the layers of Christology in which the person of Jesus was wrapped from Nicea and beyond. \n \n For what it's worth, I'll put forth my opinion that I don't believe that this Jesus desired to become an object of worship. I believe, instead, that Jesus of Nazareth saw himself as a reformer of the Judaism of his time.

   "Why do you do this, EZ? Why do you attempt to distort? Don't you think that, instead, it would be better if you read one or two of her books so that you could discuss them intelligently?\n\n \n \nI could ask you the same question - why do you distort the historical Gospels to posit your own revisionist accounts of Christ's resurrection, miracles, etc.?\n\n \n It was you who brought up the subject of Karen Armstrong's bout with epilepsy and it was you who attempted to distort her thoughts on the subject in your apparent attempt to discredit her as a scholar. You've done this five or six times across three or four Internet fora, and you've been shot down every time. Go and lick your self-inflicted wounds. \n \n \nWhy do you seek to discard the supernatural when Armstrong is quoted in you own website as saying, \"You can't prove the existence of God.\"\n \n \n She's absolutly right. Nor can one disprove the existence if God. Your point...?\n \n \nArmstrong's theology is a farce.\n\n \n Given that you've never read any of her books, I'll point out that most of them deal with the history/origin of various religions. She is, in fact, a noted historian and scholar. She describes her own personal theology in her autobiography and in some of her interviews. Can you understand the difference? I don't read Armstrong for her personal theology - I read Armstrong for her expertise in the history of religion. \n \n \nThe Gospels tell us that Jesus cast out demons who were thought to be responsible for causing certain types of human diseases including, it would appear, epilepsy (Luke 9:39; Mark 9:17-18). They also tell us that Jesus instructed his followers to do likewise (Mark 16:17).\n\n \n \nEpilepsy isn't even mentioned.\n\n \n Of course not. They considered the symptoms to be evidence of demonic possession, which is what one might expect from a pre-scientific society. Again, your point...?\n \n \nDemons weren't THOUGHT to be the problem, they WERE the problem.\n\n \n I see. And you take this position because the Bible tells you so and, therefore, it must be true? The Bible also says that followers of Jesus can drink poison and handle snakes without fear of harm.",

Why do you distort the historical Gospels to posit your own revisionist accounts of Christ's resurrection, miracles, etc.? You don't like it when it happens to Armstrong yet you do it with multiple New Testament authors and eyewitnesses. That's ten times as bad. \n \n \nWhy do you seek to discard the supernatural when Armstrong is quoted in you own website as saying, \"You can't prove the existence of God.\"\n \n \n \nShe's absolutly right. Nor can one disprove the existence if God. Your point...?\n\n \n The point is you seek to rationalize or dismiss the supernatural in the New and Old Testaments yet defend Armstrong's supernatural God. See the hole you dig for yourself?\n \n \nShe is, in fact, a noted historian and scholar.\n \n \n Her reputation isn't worth squat when it comes to true Biblical scholars, who understand who Christ is and why he came to earth. Armstrong doesn't have a clue about that yet. \n \n Frank, I recommend you expand your horizons and read something other than that liberal Spongian / Armstrong nonsense that masquerades as \"scholarship'.",

   "I would like to say that when I give my opinion on anything it is not to judge by any means. I can relate to and, for the most part, understand resentment towards God. His ways and mine are not always in line. Since we have not fully introduced ourselves...\n\n \n Quite correct, we've not introduced ourselves. I believe there is an 'Introductions' thread at this forum and I apologize for not making use of it.\n \n Perhaps some of my previous posts have given you an incorrect impression of myself. If so, I'd like to offer a few insights as to where I'm coming from.\n \n I do not harbour any resentment toward God nor do I dismiss the concept of God. I happen to believe in the existence of the Divine. I prefer that word as opposed to 'God' because I consider 'God' to be a loaded term with a lot of baggage. I further believe that most of the world's religions (at least the ones I've studied) are attempts by mankind to point to this divinity and to define it. I don't consider any of these attempts to have been divinely inspired or to be the product of divine revelation. They are, all of them, in my view, human constructs and each comes with its own set of warts. However, I consider it to be of value (to me, at least) to sift through these various religious beliefs in search of commonality - to discover aspects of those beliefs which they share in common. And part of this process, I think, involves cutting through the chaff carried along by many of these traditions. Of course, my idea of what constitutes 'chaff' almost certainly differs from that of many others. \n \n I would further add that, if I come across as overly critical of many of the teachings of conservative/fundamentalist Christianity, it's because I view elements of that particular religious tradition to be aggressive, exclusivist, anti-intellectual, and not entirely devoid of political motivation, the last of which I consider to be a threat greater than any threat posed by fundamenralist Judaism/Islam. \n \n Finally, I believe that it's possible to discuss at a forum such as this aspects of religion, especially comparative religion, as well as the rejection of religion, with a view toward both learning and sharing. \n \n \nHave a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!\n\n \n And to you!",

There is no basis in science (since science can neither prove nor disprove God and the supernatural) for that position, so I wonder how you justify labeling that \"anti-intellectual\"? Seems a bit outrageous and / or arrogant to me, as if you have some sort of knowledge base others don't have on which you can defend that viewpoint.\n \n Regarding being \"exclusivist\", God's salvation through Christ is open to everyone, no matter who they are or what they have done beforehand.\n \n And I wouldn't compare the pacifist teachings of the Biblical Christ / Christianity to fundamentalist Islam for one second. They are diametrically opposed to each other.",
