It also revised downward estimated job gains for June and July.\n\n \n The dollar index hit 79.841 and closed at 79.958. It has long been held, and has been confirmed from several central banks and oil producers, that a dollar index below 80 is basically the capitulation point for many big dollar holders. Now that we have reached that point, the clock is ticking. When the index hit 79.97, we started to see some major direct to market trades from Europe and Asia, which could only be central banks moving dollars electronically (only central banks can actually trade direct to market). \n \n If we get some major economic news in the near future that is positive, it could boost the index again which might buy us a little more time, but either way, the bleed has begun.\n \n This also puts the FED in a situation where they have NO good options. The internal economy is starting to melt down. They have the option of lowering rates, which would further trash the dollars value and may well lead to a full out capitulation on the dollar as large holders try to get out with as much value intact as possible. \n \n If they DON'T cut rates, the internal economy suffers, which drives down the value of the dollar and ultimatly has the same effect. \n \n Policy makers all over the country are scared to death of a US recession because it may well spiral out of control and be unrecoverable. There is a LOT of outstanding equity out there that cannot actually be accounted for in market terms. RE equity is a good example, current stock valuations is another, and synthetic securities is a third. When the dot come bubble crashed, Greenspan foolishly injected unlimited liquidity into a market that had no reasonable place to put it. Money will either flow somewhere or you get runaway inflation. The RE markets and associated financial markets were the only markets on the entire planet big enough to take that kind of liquidity injection. \n \n Now that those bubbles are bursting there does not seem to be much that the fed can do about it. Anything they do to try to put more money into the system (such as dropping interest rates) will be horribly inflationary because there is nowhere for those dollars to go. Once you have turned your biggest market into a bubble and it starts to pop, where do you go from there??? Loose capital has to be tied up somewhere.",

   "The fall under 80 was something I've dreaded for a while and now it's actually happened. The dominoes are falling.\n I hope that the slide into the deep global depression will be orderly so that I can still make some money out of it. I'm not rich enough yet to not care about what's going to happen.\n \n The only thing that the Fed can do to stave off the inevitable is raise rates significantly. That will boost the dollar and tank the economy. Save the system by sacrificing some if not most of the people. Better a nasty recession than literally the end of all life as we in this age know it.\n Mind you, this would only set back the clock by a couple of decades. When taking our financial, political and social systems into consideration, it's clear to see that ultimately we're screwed.\n \n But nothing will be done because it's not politically desirable and because the Fed and all their buddies actually want this to happen. I find it hard to believe that the people who were smart enough to achieve a monopoly on money don't know the consequences of the things that they've done and are still doing.\n \n The same applies to the neocons. These guys were smart enough to steal the presidency twice and together have years and years of experience in the political/military scene. But somehow they manage to screw up literally everything that they touch? \n \n I don't buy that. \n \n People look at the Fed and the Bush administration like they expect them to do good but the reality is that they are there to wreck things.\n And when you look at it that way, the Fed and Bush are doing an excellent job:\n Wreck the currency? Check.\n Wreck the economy? Check.\n Wreck the military? Check.\n Wreck the cities? Check.\n Wreck the infrastructure? Check.\n Wreck the schools? Check.\n Wreck the Constitution? Check.\n \n We'll all be waking up to a new dawn of an old age. Serfs are going to make a comeback. \n \n How people became so stupid as to think that paper is worth more than gold, I'll never know.",

   "Personally I am extremely concerned...possibly even scared...about where this is going. I am adequately protected, retired, and liquid enough to ensure that I can move as needed. All the same, looking at the housing failure, bond market problems, credit market situation, and the bleed through into the wider economy is looking MUCH worse than even the worst case scenarios I was considering only a few months ago. If things do not improve, a deep global recession may be wishful thinking.\n \n I am also concerned about some runblings that have come out of China lately. Not long ago they threatened to dump dollars (what they termed the \"nuclear option\"). The threat was met in the US by the unrealistic, poorly thought out \"we are the center of the world\" speeches that we are all so used to. \n \n A series of fairly well thought out and well documented reports have been circulating in financial circles since then, most of which have originated in china, suggesting that contrary to popular belief a global recession may be GOOD for china since recent history has shown that economic downturns and turmoil in nations they export to has increased Chinas trade with those nations as consumers switch to lower priced chinese goods and governments ease import restrictions in order to placate their people. \n \n I will be the first to agree that a correction in the world economy was inevitable. Currently the way things work...and the way we would like for them to continue to work (for obvious reasons) is that the US produces debt and the rest of the world produces things that we can buy with our debt. \n \n Obviously having the worlds most unproductive people (in terms of real wealth production...tangible goods) using up all the worlds resources and consumer goods while the folks who actually DO produce wealth live like paupers was not going to last for very long. I had just knid of hoped that the correction would take a decade or two or 3 as opposed to happening...you know...next week sometime. A slower transition woudl give Americans the chance to learn to live like mexicans and to figure out the best way to sneak into canada for jobs and health care. \n \n It will take a phenomenal amount of tough love from the fed and an incredible show of political will to allow the \"long transition\" scenario to work itself out. Lacking that, we are stuck with the \"sometime next week\" scenario which is ugly.",

   "The basic conditions:\n \n A boat load of money that has been powering our growth was on basically borrowed money. Housing sales, and seconds (etc.). This is why the local economic growth could out run things like salories and benefits. \n \n The term sub-prime has nothing to do with the borrower in that they are not sub-prime, the note is. Meaning the notes on homes where carrying rates even below the prime lending rates. As these notes fall back into a normal interest rate; the buying power of the home owners (if they can sustain the note) is crushed and this is reflected back into the economy.\n \n I believe its easy to see that next years GDP will reflect this loss of capital and have a profound impact on our investments. No one knows or is saying how much of the economy was powered by notes from housing though its easy to see it was quite large.",

How bug a problem and how long that problem is going to take to fully develop are the questions. \n \n There is a lot of data coming up that will help point the direction. On the 11th you have the July trade balance, and then on the 13th there is jobless claims, which usually is not really watched closely but a lot of people will be watching it this month due to the last NFP report. On the 14th the big data events are retail sales and capacity utilization. \n \n If we can get some GOOD news there, then maybe the dollar index can claw its way back over 80 and dollar holders can be counted on to slowly unwind their positions rather than running for the exit. \n \n Then of course there is the feds rate decision. If they go ahead and lower rates, the dollar will fall like a rock. If they boost rates, the stock market will fall off a cliff but the dollar will gain. If they leave rates untouched, the dollar and the stock market will both fall.\n \n Bernanke in the past has claimed that inflation control was in all cases the feds overwhelming concern. He has also said that he was a serious supporter of a strong dollar policy. His actions since he became chief of the fed speak FAR differently. My guess is that the fed will drop the interest rates by 1/4 point, which will send the dollar into a nosedive (200-300 pips) but give the stock market a temporary boost.\n \n Right now you are probably in a pretty good position. The performance on your mutual funds is tied to the stock market, so a rate cut will give them a little boost. Any more bad news from the credit markets might invalidate that though.\n \n The big thing in your case right now is to make sure you know how to get your money OUT if things go south, and make sure you have what it takes to do it. Some no load funds have paperwork that has to be filled out and faxed or mailed in, while others can be liquidated with a phone call. If things start getting really ugly GET YOUR MONEY OUT. There is a 0% chance of a short term market downturn here. If the market starts to fall, it is going down and staying down for a while...possibly a long time...maybe a VERY long time. It is better to take out the money and put it in your pocket than to lose 8, 10, or 50% of it in an investment. \n \n The best way I have found to do this is to set market benchmarks for when you are going to run and then STICK TO THEM. Otherwise it is too easy to fall into the \"hoping for turnaround\" mindset and substantially increase your loss. You might pick a point on the Dow, a point on the dollar index, or just about anything else that may be an indicator of the broader market and overall valuation. The forex market is historically a MUCH better indicator of the health of the broader economy than equity markets. \n \n If you don't want to put your money in your pocket, it may be a good time to start looking at alternative investment vehicles in the event you have to take your money and run. Something made in a foreign currency is probably your best bet since it will also protect you from dollar declines. Personally I like Canadian banking stocks since they are fairly reliable performers, they protect your money from dollar devaluation, and many of them are either cross listed or they have branches in the US, which allows you to avoid paying foreign investment taxes. \n \n Basically right now EVERY bad scenario that you can possibly imagine is on the table from growth slowdown to complete and total worldwide economic meltdown. We have NO IDEA where the housing notes are or how they have been leveraged and without that data, there is no possible way to make a reasonable prediction. Many studies have suggested that, including the derivative market, many of those housing notes may be leveraged as much as 400:1 which is absolutely batshit insane. If that is the case, we could well be looking at a global derivatives meltdown which basically is the worldwide economic meltdown scenario. \n \n The dollar failure scenario has also moved from \"highly possible\" to \"pretty likely\". While a dollar failure would not lead to a global economic meltdown (though a worldwide recession would be likely), it would lead to a total economic meltdown in the US. \n \n In short this basically means that no matter how you slice it there are probably rough times ahead. Right now there is not quite enough data to try to time it definitively.",

Luckily they were not holding huge amounts of dollars so the impact was limited.

From a practical standpoint any war between Iran and Saudi Arabia would be a proxy war fought in Iraq. Such a war would have little impact on our economy. Both nations have too much to lose to be willing to engage in open warfare.\n \n There is the possibility of increased attacks on oil facilities in both nations.

Maize is up 54% for the year despite a bumper crop, wheat is up 54%, rice is up 45-65% depending on whose market you are in. Those 3 crops make up over 80% of the calories consumed worldwide. \n \n The powers that be keep assuring us that it will work itself out because the higher prices will decrease demand. These are staple crops we are talking about...not caviar. The only way demand for staple crops declines is if they become expensive enough that a large proportion of the potential consumer base STARVES TO DEATH.",

   "Fascinating article here...I would appreciate any feedback on what the article says and also the credibility of the website, which has been predicting the current problems and future economic disaster for as long as I have been reading it, which is almost two years now.\n \n http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article2098.html\n \n \nThe days of the dollar as the world's \"reserve currency\" may be drawing to a close. In August, foreign central banks and governments dumped a whopping 3.8% of their holdings of US debt. Rising unemployment and the ongoing housing slump have triggered fears of a recession sending wary foreign investors running for the exits. China, Japan and Taiwan have been leading the sell off which has caused the steepest decline since 1992.\n\n \n \nOverseas investors own more than $4.4 trillion in US debt in the form of bonds and securities. Even if they sell only 25% of that sum, the US would feel the pinch of hyper-inflation. For the last decade foreigners have been eager to by our Treasuries and equities---gobbling up America's enormous $800 billion current account deficit and keeping demand for the dollar artificially high. But just like the subprime mortgage holder whose \"teaser rate\" has suddenly expired; the US now faces the painful adjustment of higher payments and less discretionary income for indulgences.\n\n \n \n Consider this: US GDP is 70% consumer spending. That means that wages have to increase beyond the rate of inflation OR THE ECONOMY CAN'T GROW. It's just that simple. So how is it that 50% of the American people still believe Bush's supply side baloney that cutting taxes for the uber-rich strengthens the economy? How does that increase wages or build a healthy middle class. If we want a strong economy wages have to keep pace with productivity so that workers can buy the goods they produce.\n \n Greenspan knows that. So does Bush. But they chose to hide it behind an \"easy credit\" smokescreen so they could weaken the dollar, off-shore thousands of industries, out-source 3 million manufacturing jobs, fund an illegal war, and maintain the lethal flow of the $800 billion current account deficit into American equities and Treasuries. In truth, there hasn't been any growth in the economy since Bush took office in 2000. What we've seen is an ever-expanding bubble of personal and corporate debt amplified by a \"structured finance\" system that magically transforms liabilities (subprime loans) into securities and increases their value through leveraging.\n \n That's it. No growth---just a galaxy of debt-instruments with odd-sounding names (CDOs, MBSs, CDSs, etc) stacked precariously on top of each other. That's what we call \"wealth\" in America.\n \n It's all smoke and mirrors. The financial system has decoupled from the productive elements of the economy and is now beginning to show disturbing signs of instability. That's why the big blow-off in the bond market. The halcyon days of supplying our armies, funding our markets and building our subprime \"ownership society\" empire on the backs of foreign creditors is over. The stock market is headed for the landfill and housing is leading the way. Economic fundamentals can only be ignored for so long.\n\n \n \nThe devastation in real estate is almost too vast to comprehend. The mortgage bubble is roughly $5.5 trillion, and yet, prices have just begun to fall. It's a long way to the bottom and there's bound to be plenty of bloodshed ahead. Two million homeowners will lose their homes. 151 mortgage lenders have already gone belly up. Many of the hedge funds-which are loaded with billions of dollars in \"mortgage-backed\" securities are struggling to stay alive. Perhaps the most shocking projection was made by Yale University Professor, Robert Schiller, who believes that home prices could decline as much as 50% in some of the \"hotter markets\". (Schiller's book \"Irrational Exuberance\" predicted the dot.com bust before it took place) The effects on the US economy would be considerable. If other factors come into play---like a stock market crash and a subsequent period of deflation---we could see housing prices descend 90% as they did between 1928 and 1933.\n\n \n What I find particularly mind-boggling is that the recent \"run on the bank\" that Northern Rock experienced here in the UK last week seemed to take everybody by surprise; the media went crazy, people I know are shocked, and the politicians are flailing about for an explanation.\n \n But sites like the one I've linked to have been predicting this for months if not years, and I have personally been warning my friends and family about this, giving my reasons, and logically sound economic arguments, and have been met with something only just short of scorn and derision. \n \n Luckily for me, I recieved some inheritance last year and sank it all into (3rd party held) physical gold. I simply arranged this with my bank. This gold has now, 11 months later, risen in value by over 10% and from what I can tell is set to rise even further. \n (gold was just over $600/ounce when I bought it and is now at over $700/ounce, I have seen many, many predictions of it rising to $1000/ounce or even $2000/ounce over the next few years.)\n \n Any comments on how far you think gold might rise would be welcome (but don't worry, I won't be making any decisions based on what I read here!) as well as any factors that might slow/reduce the seemingly inevitable price rise. \n \n At the moment I feel like waiting until it has doubled in value before converting back to pounds sterling (this seems likely!) but I've read alot of stuff that suggests I might stand to make even more...\n \n ON EDIT: I realise that if the dollar collapses, gold's dollar price will skyrocket while its price in pounds sterling will not climb by so much, but the economic fallout from a dollar collapse will still drive gold very high in any currency, not to mention the effects felt by the British pound itself from a failed dollar.",

The day will come, and in the not too distant future, that the British will feel like real fools for not pursuing closer economic integration with the EU.\n \n The British economy is in worse shape than the US economy. It is just smaller and easier to control. If you think that the US housing bubble popping has been hard on the US economy, jsut awit until the british housing bubble pops...and it WILL. While roughly 25% of Americans are living in houses that stand to loose significant value, over 80% of the British are in that situation. \n \n I would not be at all suprised to se hyperinflation in the US and see us enter a full blown depression in the next few years.

I thought that we had until Jan until things were quite this bad. My thinking was that the downturn and creepage into other markets would follow mortgage resets by 4-6 months. For all the press that mortgage resets are getting, they have not so far turned out to be the major drivers of mortgage default. People are defaulting at the teaser rate, they are not even making it to the reset (over 80% of ARM foreclosures in the last 6 months were on loans that had NOT reset). \n \n We did not even start hitting big reset numbers until last month. I am starting to wonder exactly how bad this mess is going to be once those resets actually do start to matter. If people are defaulting on the teaser rates, the resets will be bloody as hell. I would imagine that we will know for sure in about feb or march how this is ultimatly going to shake out.\n \n I did see that greenspan updated his prediction from \"1-2% decline nationwide\" to \"double digit declines nationwide\". I still don't think that greenspan is all that credible, but he does seem to be trying to tap into reality lately as he works feverishly to convince people that this is NOT his fault (it is) and to preserve his legacy (which is probably not going to be good and he damn well knows it).",

   "I have no idea. The degree to which this reminds me of the dot com bubble is almost surreal. It really makes you wonder if Bernanke has any brains at all when he gets up there and says that the fed was caught by surprise that problems in RE leaked into other market segments. What kind of idiot could possibly have believed that problems in the nations largest asset class would NOT have wider implications??\n And yet that was one of the smarter thoughts regarding the real estate market. The dumber one, in my opinion, was that it would last 6 months or so and rebound. Of course the \"experts\" have been saying this every 6 months and I suppose one day they will be right just like a broken clock is right twice a day. \n \n \nI will admit that things have progressed much faster than I believed they would. I thought that we had until Jan until things were quite this bad. My thinking was that the downturn and creepage into other markets would follow mortgage resets by 4-6 months. For all the press that mortgage resets are getting, they have not so far turned out to be the major drivers of mortgage default. People are defaulting at the teaser rate, they are not even making it to the reset (over 80% of ARM foreclosures in the last 6 months were on loans that had NOT reset). \nThe progression into other markets including banks that didn't do home loans was a little sooner but I thought the defaulting on mortgages would start much earlier than it did. This time last year was when we first started hearing a lot of news about the housing market slowing down but normally the news lags a little bit on the reality in these areas meaning the defaults should have been in full force Jan of last year. Like you said those teaser rates really didn't do much good because people couldn't even afford that! I think the biggest indicator of this was just looking at the average salary and the average home cost and making a simple calculation. I realize this doesn't give you a great look but it does help give you a ballpark idea of whether a problem may exist or not. I don't have the numbers on me right now but I think the average salary for a home buying was well under $100,000 a year (well well under) and yet they were buying homes costing 300-400k making their monthly payment a super majority of their monthly income after taxes. Unless you were a believer that a high cost house gets you a promotion at work I'm not sure how people thought they could afford it!\n \n \nWe did not even start hitting big reset numbers until last month. I am starting to wonder exactly how bad this mess is going to be once those resets actually do start to matter. If people are defaulting on the teaser rates, the resets will be bloody as hell. I would imagine that we will know for sure in about feb or march how this is ultimatly going to shake out.\nI don't claim to be an expert in this area but if you are right it's gonna get scary for some...not so much for me.\n \n \nI did see that greenspan updated his prediction from \"1-2% decline nationwide\" to \"double digit declines nationwide\". I still don't think that greenspan is all that credible, but he does seem to be trying to tap into reality lately as he works feverishly to convince people that this is NOT his fault (it is) and to preserve his legacy (which is probably not going to be good and he damn well knows it).\nI think the fed needs to learn you can never soften the blow but only delay it. \n \n One thing I'm wondering about is whether the housing bubble was a direct result of the dotcom bubble. After the collapse of the stock market you'd think many folks would invest in real estate thus causing a new bubble as an extreme reaction to the unstable stock market. If this is true (and again I'm no expert) then we really have seen the fed cause the problem they were designed to prevent.",

Of course the \"experts\" have been saying this every 6 months and I suppose one day they will be right just like a broken clock is right twice a day. \n\n \n I remember laughing out loud when greenspan sat there in front of congress after a few months of very minor price drops and said \"I think the housing market has hit bottom and will start to recover\".

Unless you were a believer that a high cost house gets you a promotion at work I'm not sure how people thought they could afford it!\n\n \n What??/ You mean that spending 70% of your income on a McMansion payment is not sound personal monetary policy?? Who woul have thunk it :)\n \n Back in the real world, the RE market departed from fundamentals way back in 1996. This is why my predictions have been a lot more dire than a lot of others out there. Granted I am a little behind the curve, but I will bet you a dollar that before this is all said and done, we see a nationwide 30% reduction in RE prices with declines of 50% in some areas (from peak). \n \n \nI don't claim to be an expert in this area but if you are right it's gonna get scary for some...not so much for me.\n\n \n Not so much for you??? If I was you, I would be spending a lot of time with a smug grin on my face. Nice (secure) government job...I am assuming with the typical COLA. You were smart enough to to run out and buy an overpriced cardboard box, so you can sit back, wait for your market, buy one out of foreclosure for 30-50 cents on the dollar. \n \n A word of advice, though. Go to work for the GAO. They have a better COLA than most states offer, and I think that their accountants are about to become VERY busy as people start trying to figure out exactly what the hell happened, and our elected leaders start trying to figure out how we can blame this on the Mexicans, Chinese, Iranians, or Canadians. \n \n \nOne thing I'm wondering about is whether the housing bubble was a direct result of the dotcom bubble. After the collapse of the stock market you'd think many folks would invest in real estate thus causing a new bubble as an extreme reaction to the unstable stock market. If this is true (and again I'm no expert) then we really have seen the fed cause the problem they were designed to prevent.\n\n \n I think absolutely. I have been saying this for nearly 3 years now and everybody looks at me like I have a crack pipe hanging out of my mouth. I think your timeline is a little off though.\n \n We started seeing abnormal increases in the RE market in 1996. What better way to spend your dot com generated wealth than by running out and buying a $200,000 cardboard and sawdust home?? \n \n In a natural market, when the dot com bubble popped, housing would have dropped because the capital influx from the dot com bubble would have petered out and the financial weakness that would have gone with that would have driven down the prices due to the weakened fundamentals. \n \n Instead, \"the maestro\" (and yes, that WAS a joke) basically drove real interest rates far into negative territory which essentially gave lenders some SERIOUS motivation to get out there and shove money in peoples pockets. There was nowhere for that money to go except the RE market. No other US market was big enough to take that kind of influx of capital. \n \n Then Wall Street got into the game. Regulatory changes requiring certain funds (pension funds, etc...) to hold AAA rated bonds created a huge demand for such bonds. Now, in theory those regulation were supposed to force those funds to buy treasury bonds, but fund managers wanted higher returns than treasury issues were paying, which put wall street under pressure to generate high rated, high return bonds. They decided that mortgage paper was the way to go.\n \n That is when lending standards went from \"insanely loose\" to \"absolutely idiotic\". There was huge demand for those bond issues, and the wall street engine was bound and determined to meet that demand. Ratings were established by using TRADITIONAL mortgage default rates for loan classes, without taking into account that the lending standards had gone from traditional to absolutely idiotic. They basically assumed that a mortgage generated in 2005 for $200K to a borrower with no job, no assets, and no down payment carried the same risk of default as a loan issued 10 years earlier, when there was a 10% down payment, the payment amounted to less than 40% of the borrowers income, and the borrower had some late credit card payments (that is what \"sub prime\" used to mean). \n \n Then, since Wall street still could not sell as many of those bonds as they wanted as AAA, they divided them into tranches based on REPAYMENT ORDER, not credit worthiness. They named these tranches prime, mezzanine, and subprime. People assumed that the prime securities contained prime mortgages, and the sub prime securities contained sub prime mortgages. The talking heads on wall street assure us that they were not trying to deceive anybody...it was just coincidence that they chose naming conventions that have never been used in relation to bonds before that happen to coincide with standard language used when it comes to mortgages. They CERTAINLY never meant to imply that those prime tranches contained only prime mortgages.\n \n And if you believe that, I have a bridge for sale. \n \n What this boils down to is that the fed created the RE problem when they pumped the market after the dot come bubble popped. Not only was the RE market not able to make a much needed correction, the massive capital injection caused it to boom further. When they dropped rates, there was a lot of speculation that it would lead to a RE bubble. Even Greenspan admits this was a primary concern. I think that the fed believed that they could pump the market, then deflate is slowly over the course of several years. Basically halt its growth and let inflation wipe out the illogical gains. \n \n When wall street got into the action and basically subverted traditional lending avenues, the fed lost control. The RE market took on a life of its own and suddenly the fed had little or no influence. The money supply also took on a life of its own, which is why their constant rate increases never really did anything as far as taking a bite out of inflation. They no longer controlled the money supply, they no longer controlled borrowing rates (those were under the control of bond brokers).",

Ebay items, for example, are sold to the highest bidder...does that make that the fair value price? Only to one person haha.\n\n \n \n If you really look at the markets, they started moving in '96, despte the facts that fundamentals really started to look bad about the same time. Baswed on fundamentals, housing shoudl have started contractign in late '97 and we should have seen serious contraction starting in 2000 as the dot com bubble was giving way. Instead we saw solid growth from 96 on, and then when the dot com bubble popped we saw massive expansion rather than the sizeable contraction that should have come with the large decrease in national wealth and drop in incomes. \n \n It is not difficult to figure out roughly where housing SHOULD be. Housing has always followed certain fundamentals. \n \n I started to answer this post yesterday, then decided to hold off until today after the pending home sales data came out.\n \n 6.5% drop....economists were expecting a 2% drop. Projections ranged from a 4.7% drop to a 3.1% gain, so the actual results were MUCH worse than any of them expected. \n \n http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=a2XKiicl2NUs&refer=us\n \n \n``The existing homes market is now in freefall,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics Ltd., in Valhalla, New York. ``The downside from here is still substantial.'' \n\n \n \n``Fewer contract were being written because of mortgage- availability issues,'' said Lawrence Yun, a senior economist at the real estate agents group. More than 10 percent of signed contracts fell through in August because buyers couldn't secure financing, Yun said. \n\n \n \nSales of previously owned homes fell in August to the lowest level in five years, the Realtors group reported Sept. 25. Two days later, the Commerce Department said new-home sales declined to a seven-year low and median prices dropped by the most since 1970. \n\n \n I have adjusted my projections to account for the new data over the last couple of months, and it is working out to be close again, so I am happy. In my own defense...sure, my projections were off, but who would have thought that people would be defaulting on an ARM that was still running at a 1% teaser rate?? I mean...come on...some things you just can't possibly foresee.\n \n The funny thing is that when I first put my projections together last year I submitted them to a private mailing list I am on that is composed primaraly of economically and financially minded people and everybody scoffed at it. Hundreds of pages of replies were written shredding my results. I stuck by my results and jsut said \"we will see\". I thought I might get booted off the list.\n \n Now it has turned out that my results, which people were calling \"a doomsday scenario\" and \"laughably pessimistic\" were not pessimistic enough. \n \n Divide monthy house payment by monthly net income. If the result is .8, there is a BIG problem. It is not that complicated.",
