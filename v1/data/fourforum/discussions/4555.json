   "Stop inhumane experiments over Iraqi children!!!!!!!\n Oh my! I recently encountered stunning information concerning Iraq! Or concerning what Americans do in Iraq with the locals. I was really shocked and my eyes wide open when I was reading it! Unfortunately I lost the link but I will retell you what I happened to get to know. The people at the CIA technical group in Iraq set inhumane experiments over Iraqi children! It is outrageous! The children are absolutely harmless! And these monsters from CIA give them injections of various chemicals and add toxins to their food. Of course, many children die in the death struggle. Some children die of blood loss after they get deblooded and their blood transfused to the American wounded soldiers. How inhumane it is! How monstrous! Bloodcurdling!!! On the hearsay form the president George Bush's entourage, he prays for the souls of the Iraqi children but won't give the order to stop it. Mr George Bush, I address to you: you are MONSTER!!!!!!!!!!",

   "That would be funny if she wasn't serious. Dan Rather must have told you about this. First of all, the CIA does not have the resources here to conduct any expiriments at all, they do not supply food or medicine to the Local Nationals. As for the blood transfusion theory, that is the most absurd of all, the presence of blood born disease here is very very high. If I was wounded and they pulled some random kid to \"donate\" then I would shoot my medic. This is all very absurd, I don't even think the Bush haters would believe any of this.",
