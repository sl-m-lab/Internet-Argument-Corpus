   "DEar fellows if you do not believe your sense and think that you are so common .You could be so cheap as an addictors if you believe in Gods why dont you feet on fires when tieing yourself on cross . If you dont believe on your sense just blinded your eyes for seeing bad matter and cut your arms after you have sreal. If you still donot believe on your sense enlarge it by taking drugs then you can possibly cut your throats without pains.Some poets reguired Lsd to figured out or to be viewed.Some dementing peoples are talents.If you still dont believe in this and you have some dissatisfy and hatreds like me you wait for the doomsdaysssss but i count on the happy life remained :xbanghead emoticon_xkill emoticon_xkill emoticon_xbouncer emoticon_xbouncer \n \n By cheung shun sang Laplace181\n \n Your senses or Gods\n \n Dear fellows if you don not believe your senses and think that you are not so common. You could be so cheap as to be some addicted ones. If you believed in Gods then why do not you feet on fires when tie yourself on cross with electrical shocks to your invisible orgasm. If you do not believe on your senses then you can blinded your eyes for not-seeing bad things or cut your arms after taking a penny. If you still do not believed on your senses then enlarge them by taking drugs so you can cut your throat with out pains that is probably possible. Some poets required L.S.D. to figure out or to view his words. Some dement peoples are talents. If you still do not believe in this and you of course have some dissatisfactions and hatreds like me then you wait for the doomsdays....sss.\n While I count on my happy life that is bivalent that are honors and dishonors , Humble and esteems also pure and impure and dirty and clean. There are many magical herbs and plants all over our globes which can ease our pains and some suppressed our appetites even making Jesus and all his men have climates that elevated up before water fonts. Not all addicted ones dead in ****ing lakes. They are cactus , mushrooms, Coca-leafs and many other natural hallucinogens. They are developed in Spains,Mexico, Indian and Egypt. Three thousands men are viewed as feed on some magic fruits or plants instead of five breads and two fishes.\n They all have a good day without electricity. There loves and desires are discharged beyond that they obtained foods. Jesus are less prompt to the drugs because he was always God-addicted. They may be humps, Coca-leafs or caffeine containing herbs or fruits. I may see snows for fires if I had took such drugs and I may bite the chastity-belts of my same sex. Two fishes did not seem to be stink before I loose my desires for sex because of overdoes. . \n :xbanghead :xbanghead",

   "whoa...\n I didnt understand half of your post but the other half I found intriguing enough to post a reply. Are you exaiming the possiblity of Jesus and his disciples being just a bunch of guys tripping out? Thats an interesting perspective. Next, I totally agree with you about the many uses of drugs. I also feel drugs are tools that can be used for enlightenment and inspiration. But like any tool, drugs can be used to hinder and sabatoge. A hammer can be used to build a house or to smash somebody's skull in. The choice is up to the user. \n PEACE",

   "Ninjita\n Thats a great site you recommended. It full of very complete and very impartial information (traits that are very rare in the illicit drug world). Thanks for posting it. I have a question though. Im sure we could all agree that pot, shrooms, peyote, organic opiates, and most other naturally occuring drugs should be legalized. But what about drugs like meth, MDMA, and LSD? Should these drugs be legalized as well?",

   "Personally, I believe that with responsibility one could experiment with any drug and that it should be legal. However, the majority of the world is rather irresponsible and the addiction that goes along with many drugs only decreases the user's responsibility. Heroine, for instance, is supposedly the greatest experience in the world and if you're looking to try it only once and have some self control than i think it would be a good experience. But...I've heard of people becoming full blown addicts after only 2 experimentations. My uncle has recently lost his family, his wife, and is now in rehab because it has such a strong hold on him. \n \n This would be common place if it were legal, you've heard of China's widespread addiction to Opium, it caused the downfall of an entire culture. \n \n It all revolves around responsibility, if you are responsible and can say no to some things then experimentation is a good way to broaden your horizens and look at life through different eyes. \n \n Theoretically anything can be done with responsibility, but some drugs make even the most willful responsible people craving addicts. I am and have always been against synthetic substances such as X, PCP, Meth, Heroine, etc... Mainly because of the ease of addiction. Acid, however, isn't as addictive and could be used responsibly. If many of these drugs were to become legal, there would have to be strong laws regarding the use because you often become a different person under the influence. Logical reasonable desicions are void when you are taking shrooms, for example, that's why you should only take them in a safe environment with a sitter. People are irresponsible so you'd have people tripping nuts behind the wheel of a car, walking the streets, etc...\n \n Take it one step at a time, Marijuana being illegal for example is a straight up waste and it should be the first to be legalized.\n \n Some drugs are for the few that can handle them. Poets, philosophers, we would not have some of their creative and intuitive works we do today had it not been for experimentation. \n \n Remember, always stay open minded, drugs arent for everybody.\n \n Ninjita Con Ganjita :)",
