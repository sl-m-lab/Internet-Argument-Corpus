   "India: Dozens of police dead after Maoist ambush - CNN.com\n \n \nNew Delhi, India (CNN) -- Seventy-two police officers were killed in an attack early Tuesday by suspected Maoists in eastern India, authorities said.\n \n About 200 officers from the federal Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and a local police group were conducting a road inspection in Chhattisgarh state's Dantewada district when the assault occurred, according to officials.\n \n Dantewada's top district administrator Reena Kangale told CNN that the attackers fired at the security officers and set off landmine explosions.\n \n The attack and subsequent shootout lasted four hours, she said. Authorities launched rescue operations after the shootout ended, she added.\n \n There was no immediate report of casualties on the Maoist side, Kangale added. The road inspection by the officers was being carried out ahead of a planned transportation of food to a camp of internally-displaced people, she explained.\n \n India regards the communist rebels as its gravest internal security threat.\n \n The Maoists, on the other hand, have claimed since the 1960s to be fighting for the dispossessed.\n \n In February, India's home minister P. Chidambaram acknowledged that more than 900 people, including almost 600 civilians, were killed in Maoist-related incidents in 2009.\n \n Some 200 suspected rebels were also slain as forces moved into areas under insurgent control, he said.\n \n \"I am confident that the state governments concerned will gradually gain the upper hand and re-establish the authority of the civil administration,\" Chidambaram told an internal security conference on February 7.\n \n Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, however, conceded last year that the nation's fight with the Maoists had fallen short of objectives.\n \n Maoists enjoy support not only in the poorest areas and in tribal communities but also among youth and the intelligentsia, officials suspect.\n \n \"We have not achieved as much success as we would have liked in containing this menace,\" Singh said last September. \"It is a matter of concern that, despite our efforts, the level of violence in the affected states continues to rise.\"\n \n In 2008, 1,591 Maoist rebel attacks killed 721 people, according to government officials.\n \n In addition to targeting police, alleged police informers and people they call \"class enemies,\" the rebels are also believed to be attacking infrastructure such as roads, bridges, railways, and power and telecommunication networks.\n\n \n So let's see now. 72 officers murdered today. 900 people murdered in 2009. 721 people murdered in 2008.\n \n And India has very, very strict gun control laws. Yet mass killings of this level seem to happen on a regular basis.\n \n How can so many people be getting murdered every single year if gun control is supposed to save lives in the first place?",

   "Alright I think it's time that Galileo get his comeuppance and be sent packing again so he can hide for another month and slip into obscurity further than he is currently. Because we all know that when things get tough he hits the highway.\n \n \nIt's because the federal government in the US is powerful enough to stop such rebels (as demonstrated by the above article). Although a more powerful government is the reason there are less mass killings in the US than in more politically unstable nations, nations such as England and Australia have even less mass killings than the US.\n\n \n I'd like to see some actual proof that it's powerful governments in places like England and Australia that are the deciding factor in stopping mass killings from happening.\n \n Go ahead and present your evidence. You wouldn't have said it if you didn't have something to back it up with.\n \n \nThe fact that some parents may subject their children to abuse is not a valid argument against parents in general having any type of control at all over their children.\n\n \n That's an awful poor comparison for you to be making. There's a large difference between a stressed parent beating their child under a moment of great duress, and a government signing the order to carry out the execution of six million people.\n \n When parents display bad behaviors, somebody comes in and removes the kids so they can't be hurt and requires the parents to adjust their behavior before they ever get their kids back. But you don't see that when it comes to the government, they've been getting away with things that should never be allowed.\n \n Next time you plan to make a comparison to prove a point, use your head!\n \n \n\"In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men the great difficulty lies in this: You must first enable the government to control the governed, and in the next place, oblige it to control itself.\"\n -James Madison, Federalist No. 51 \n \n \"Nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of government, and it is equally undeniable, that whenever and however it is instituted, the people must cede to it some of their natural rights in order to vest it with requisite powers.\"\n John Jay, Federalist No. 2\n\n \n Sorry but the Federalist papers are superseded by the opinions of the Founding Fathers regarding government growing too big for its britches, the Constitution, and the Declaration of Independence listing the crimes that King George had been charged with by the people of the colonies of America.\n \n The Founding Fathers weren't stupid. They'd just gotten done dealing with a mad dictator and his kangaroo court where there was no justice, only \"I'm the king and what I say goes!\" They never would've supported the proposition of trading one tyrant 3,000 miles away for 3,000 tyrants one mile away. They specifically set in place a system of checks and balances that were meant to keep the government from getting out of control.\n \n So you can go ahead and quote Federalist papers until you're blue in the face, it's not going to amount to anything in support of your position.\n \n \nThe people are kept under control so that they don't violate the rights of each other. In a state of anarchy, the strong can easily dominate the weak. Might makes right. Government steps in to settle disputes between individuals more fairly and in accordance with law. So it's not contradictory. It's basic political philosophy and the justification for government.\n\n \n Your view on it leaves too much room for the government to be the strong that dominates the weak. What recourse do the people have when the government controls them through threats of force for noncompliance?\n \n \nSo were members of the militia group in the mid west that planned to kill police officers on drugs? Are you trying to defend them?\n\n \n Have they been proven guilty in a court of law? Is there evidence against them or is it just hearsay?

So all this fear mongering about extremist groups arming themselves, it's completely unfounded and nothing more than extreme paranoia, irrational distrust of your fellow citizen.\n \n I suggest you view the videos like this before you go around spouting off about things you have no idea about.\n \n \nSo either England and Australia are 100% safe and murder free or they are 100% unsafe- a false dilemma and diversionary tactic.

That case alone overturned a lot of cases and the law upon which they were based.\n \n How come you deny you are not demonizing militia but were first to mention them and continue to do so in illogical rants and tirades?

   "As far as fighting crime goes, your claim that I think that gun control is the only thing that works is a straw man argument. I tend to keep my comments relevant to gun control because this is the gun control forum. If you want to debate all factors related to crime control then go to the crime forum on this board. The fact that more people die in mass killings in nations like Mexico and India could be an argument for bigger government in those nations. A more powerful government can keep the people under control and protect their rights from being violated by armed rebels and other such radicals as happened in a recent case in the US:\n \n \"According to a federal indictment unsealed this morning in Detroit, members of the Midwestern militia group had planned multiple attacks on police officers or other law enforcement personnel as a way of acting out their hatred for the government.\n \n \"Weekend raids by the FBI in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana stopped the plot, authorities said, before any attacks could be carried out.\"\n FBI: Mich. Militia Plotted to Kill Police - CBS News\n \n So this group intended to kill police officers just like Maoist rebels did in India. You ask why a similar massacre hasn't happened in the US. It's because the federal government in the US is powerful enough to stop such rebels (as demonstrated by the above article). Although a more powerful government is the reason there are less mass killings in the US than in more politically unstable nations, nations such as England and Australia have even less mass killings than the US. This fact seriously undermines your claim about the system in the US working the best.\n\n \n Hey goober, did you forget your post on the last page?

You wouldn't have said it if you didn't have something to back it up with.\n\n I was talking about the powerful government in the US stopping rebels. I brought up England and Australia as examples of nations that undermine your theory about more mass killings in nations with more gun control. Are governments in England and Australia more powerful than in the US? I don't think so. \n \n \n\n That's an awful poor comparison for you to be making. There's a large difference between a stressed parent beating their child under a moment of great duress, and a government signing the order to carry out the execution of six million people.\n \n When parents display bad behaviors, somebody comes in and removes the kids so they can't be hurt and requires the parents to adjust their behavior before they ever get their kids back. But you don't see that when it comes to the government, they've been getting away with things that should never be allowed.\n \n Next time you plan to make a comparison to prove a point, use your head!\n \n\n It was not a perfect analogy but you're missing the main point- just because some governments may abuse their powers is not a valid argument against government control in general. \n \n \n\n Sorry but the Federalist papers are superseded by the opinions of the Founding Fathers regarding government growing too big for its britches, the Constitution, and the Declaration of Independence listing the crimes that King George had been charged with by the people of the colonies of America.\n \n The Founding Fathers weren't stupid. They'd just gotten done dealing with a mad dictator and his kangaroo court where there was no justice, only \"I'm the king and what I say goes!\" They never would've supported the proposition of trading one tyrant 3,000 miles away for 3,000 tyrants one mile away. They specifically set in place a system of checks and balances that were meant to keep the government from getting out of control.\n \n So you can go ahead and quote Federalist papers until you're blue in the face, it's not going to amount to anything in support of your position.\n\n The Constitution actually created a more powerful government. The Founders understood the dangers of both government having too little power and of government having too much power. The Constitution corrected the problem of a government that had too little power. \n \n \n\n Your view on it leaves too much room for the government to be the strong that dominates the weak. What recourse do the people have when the government controls them through threats of force for noncompliance?\n\n The Constitution contains a system of checks and balances to keep government power from getting out of control. I am not advocating a government that is either too weak or one that is too powerful.

And yet, despite having gun control similar to England and Australia, India was the scene of the 2009 Mumbai Massacre, and this year's mass murder of uniformed police officers.\n \n The facts speak for themselves. England and Australia aren't safe since they've done nothing to effectively defend themselves from outside attack. Why haven't Mumbai incidents appeared in England and Australia? It's sure not because of gun control, it didn't protect India despite their vast similarities.\n \n You really need to try harder at making a sound argument.

Instead of set about limits to keep the government from getting out of control. Look at the Bill of Rights and the list of things the government from forbidden from interfering with: practice of religion, public gathers, free speech, privacy, public trials, bearing arms, private property, etc. It even says right in the Bill of Rights that the powers not delegated to the federal government will remain strictly under control of the states and the people who voted the government into office.\n \n If you're going to try and make the argument that the Founding Fathers intended to elevate themselves and their government to the status of either king or God, try and actually make a point!\n \n \nHow often do we see politicians covering up for politicians of a different political party?\n\n \n That's irrelevant. Answer the damn question already; how do the checks and balances set in place actually work when the ones in charge of enforcing them are the same government they seek to limit?\n \n Try and use what you have for a brain when you come here.\n \n \nThe people already do play a role in checking government power- through non violent means of course.\n\n \n What, the ballot box? It's hardly an option anymore. There's no way to reject everyone when all of the candidates are unacceptable. We're not able to write \"none of the above - send new candidates for evaluation\" we're forced to pick the lesser of possible evils, and the people we hate the least.\n \n That hardly seems like a check of the people against the government. Playing \"Who is gonna **** me over to the lesser extent\" isn't the way to go.\n \n \nThis is ridiculous- making no distinction between legitimate use of government power and the abuse of government power. In other words you're saying all government power is bad.\n\n \n Because all government is bad. There's not a single form of government that's interested in what's best for the people.

Ms. Larsen said she had not listened entirely to certain recordings made by an undercover agent who infiltrated the group. \n \n She said that because they were still being examined, she didn't know if weapons seized by investigators last month were illegal. \n \n At other times, Ms. Larsen couldn't answer questions because she said she hadn't reviewed investigative reports. \n \n Defense lawyer William Swor asked if the No. 1 defendant, Hutaree leader David Stone, had ever instructed anyone to make a bomb. \n \n \"I can't fully answer that question,\" the agent replied. \n \n Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Tukel defended Ms. Larsen, telling the judge it wasn't clear until Monday that she would testify. \n \n Judge Roberts, however, said she told the government to be prepared last week. \n \n Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Waterstreet played an audiotape of what he said were several militia members talking freely about killing police. \n \n The participants talked over each other, often laughed and made goofy noises and disparaging remarks about law enforcement. \n \n Prosecutors objected to questions about interpreting the secretly recorded conversations, but the judge said they were fair game. \n \n The judge will resume the court hearing today. \n \n Prosecutors will have a chance to question people who are willing to be responsible for some of the nine if they are released from jail\n\n \n Nah, the burden is on the prosecution to prove their threat if released. This is another one of those \"we don't know\" answers...or \"please let us off the hook because we don't have any evidence\".\n \n I wonder how long this Judge (Roberts) will let this irresponsible behavior go on?",

She did not make a decision about whether the nine will remain in custody, saying only that a ruling would come soon.\n The members of a southern Michigan group called Hutaree have been in custody for a month. An indictment accuses them of weapons violations and a rare crime: conspiring to commit sedition, or rebellion, against the government by first killing police officers.\n Prosecutors say the public would be at risk if the nine are released. But \n defense lawyers claim the government has overreached with a criminal case based mostly on hateful speech.\n An undercover agent infiltrated the group and secretly made recordings that \n have been played in court. While there is talk about killing police, it's \n not specific. In one conversation, there are many people talking over each \n other and laughing.\n Roberts pressed that point more than once as Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald \n Waterstreet argued in favor of keeping the nine in jail. The judge \n suggested she didn't hear or read in the transcripts any indication that \n violence was imminent.\n \"Mere presence where a crime may be planned is not a crime. ... How does \n this add up to seditious conspiracy?\" Roberts said.\n Waterstreet said the government is not required to show all its evidence at \n this early stage of the case.

Time is up,\" Waterstreet said, quoting a transcript.\n Later, putting the transcript aside, the prosecutor said: \"The theme is the \n brotherhood is the enemy - all law enforcement.\"\n Defense lawyers urged the judge to look at each defendant individually. \n Although all are charged with conspiracy, they were not always together \n during critical meetings cited by the government.\n \"'What if' is not the standard. ... None of these words are an instruction \n to anyone to commit a crime,\" said Stone's attorney, William Swor, as held \n up a stack of transcripts.\n Arthur Weiss, a lawyer for Thomas Piatek, 46, of Whiting, Ind., said disgust \n with the government as recorded by the undercover agent is similar to what's \n said daily by radio and TV talk-show hosts Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck and \n Sean Hannity.\n \"Millions of people\" are talking about \"taking our country back,\" Weiss \n said.\n The judge also heard from relatives of some of the defendants who pledged to be responsible for them if they were released from jail.\n \n \n I know the \"weapons violations claim\" has already been disproven and there were no \"illegal guns\" in the possession of the wrongfully accused. My personal opinion is that it will be impossible for the accusers to prove sedition as intent unless they are all Madam Swami. They don't have a darn thing except a SHOWTIME moment but this time we get to inspect their orfices.\n \n Expect a retalitory massive lawsuit by the accused to end these practices by government agencies abuse of authority!",

Just in time to go along with this part of the thread, I found this expose on the the Southern Poverty Law Center. \n \n   Hatred, Intolerance, Violence and the Southern Poverty Law Center \n They recently released a document entitled \"Meet the Patriots.\" In it, they list thirty five individuals as leaders of the \"patriot\" movement and five \"enablers.\" The suggestion they are making, based on their past zealous crusades and their stated purposes, is that these people are not only somehow racist, extremist, hateful or violent, but most importantly, dangerous. I am familiar with a number of the personalities listed, but not all of them. These are not violent or dangerous people, in my opinion, and for the most part they are calling for using peaceful and lawful methods to effect change.

I understand that you don't have the equivalent National Guard, and your organized Texas Militia acts in the National Guard capacity.

The militia operates in times of civil events like hurricanes and other tragedies where damage or the potential of damage can or does occur. The Adjutant General of the State is the chief Commanding officer and works with the Govenor and co-ordinates with the DPS. The Texas Rangers were the first Militia and they were formed in companies which is continued on to this day. When the NG is called up, one of the duties of the State Guard is to take control of the National Guard armories and duties, so yes, they serve in that capacity. It is a pretty austute military organization ready to mobilize rather quickly...not unlike State Guards in various other States although all States do not have a State Guard/militia. They get the same training as does any military group and have officers appointed by the Governor and a chain of command not unlike the National Guard except they cannot be called out of State. Govenor Ma Richards made that mistake of calling an out of State National guard into Waco in a blantant unconstitutional act courtesy of Bill Clinton and Janet Reno.",

   "So let's see now...\n \n Basically you're saying that even though England and Australia have taken no steps to secure their borders from invasion, and done nothing that would prevent drug runners and gun smugglers from sneaking in prohibited items, and they still have very dangerous people within their nations, and yet somehow they've managed to avoid mass killings from taking place?\n\n I never said that England and Australia had done nothing to prevent prohibited items from entering the nation, but the fact that dangerous people have committed less mass killings in these nations is significant and contradicts your claims. \n \n \n\n If you look at the gun control laws in place, those in the countries of England and Australia are almost the same as the gun control laws in place within India. And yet, despite having gun control similar to England and Australia, India was the scene of the 2009 Mumbai Massacre, and this year's mass murder of uniformed police officers.\n \n The facts speak for themselves. England and Australia aren't safe since they've done nothing to effectively defend themselves from outside attack. Why haven't Mumbai incidents appeared in England and Australia? It's sure not because of gun control, it didn't protect India despite their vast similarities.\n \n You really need to try harder at making a sound argument. Dealing with you is like shooting fish in a barrel.\n\n I'm not sure which of my arguments the above unsupported claims supposedly refutes.\n \n \n\n Because I'm trying to make you see the fallacy in your argument.\n \n The United States Constitution did nothing to create a powerful government. Instead of set about limits to keep the government from getting out of control. Look at the Bill of Rights and the list of things the government from forbidden from interfering with: practice of religion, public gathers, free speech, privacy, public trials, bearing arms, private property, etc. It even says right in the Bill of Rights that the powers not delegated to the federal government will remain strictly under control of the states and the people who voted the government into office.\n \n If you're going to try and make the argument that the Founding Fathers intended to elevate themselves and their government to the status of either king or God, try and actually make a point!\n \n That's irrelevant. Answer the damn question already; how do the checks and balances set in place actually work when the ones in charge of enforcing them are the same government they seek to limit?\n \n Try and use what you have for a brain when you come here.\n \n Because all government is bad. There's not a single form of government that's interested in what's best for the people. All government cares about is what's in its own interests.\n\n So is the Bill of Rights not good enough for you? Guess who's in charge of enforcing that? And is the government that was involved in creating the Bill of Rights bad and only concerned about its own interests? I don't see any point or consistency in whatever argument you're trying to make. \n \n \n \n\n Airport security is public theater, it's designed for nothing more than making people think that they're safe. It's not gonna stop somebody from coming in with a suicide vest and blowing up a whole line of innocent people. Just like gun control does nothing to stop drive-by shootings or criminal access to firearms.\n \n \n You just described yourself perfectly. You cherry pick, you dance in blood. Stop both at once!\n\n You're the one that started this thread making sweeping generalizations about gun control based on very limited information.",
