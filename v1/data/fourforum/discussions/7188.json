   "Have your \"homework\" ready for your debates. Give examples. I was reading an article about how confidence and the way a person speaks can convince the other person that they are correct. Sometimes they can look so confident (but not overconfident) that the other person does not want to fight back, even if they have their info. You can be saying a load of XXXX and they will be confinced that what you are saying is correct. An example that they were giving of this type of person was Margret Thatcher.... \n \n But that doesn't really help because you are not going to be debating someone face to face, so they won't be able to see your expressions etc...\n \n Oh, and here's another one. Try to confuse your opponent by giving them questions for them to think about themselves.\n \n Anyway, i'm not that great at debating... Im only 13...:)",
