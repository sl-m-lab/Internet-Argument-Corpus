   "Right to bear arms?\n \n \nColorado State University-Pueblo's recently approved weapons policy, which banned concealed weapons, was shelved Wednesday by the system's Board of Governors.\n \n At its regular monthly meeting in Fort Collins the board voted unanimously to rescind the action it took in February to approve weapons policies for CSU-Pueblo, CSU-Fort Collins, CSU Global Campus and the CSU system.\n \n The board's action Wednesday comes as a result of a recent Colorado Court of Appeals ruling that the University of Colorado has no authority to bar students or visitors from lawfully carrying guns on campus.\n \n The CU Board of Regents had adopted the ban on all its campuses, with the understanding that the state's Concealed Carry Act did not apply to universities.\n \n The court of appeals in April found that when the Legislature standardized the rules governing concealed weapons in 2003 it intended for the act to apply everywhere in the state except for a few places, including K-12 schools.\n \n In December, the CSU board voted to consider banning weapons on the CSU-Pueblo and CSU-Fort Collins campuses primarily because of risk-management purposes.\n \n The CSU campuses were among only a few in the country that allowed concealed weapons on campus.\n \n The BOG had directed its school presidents to develop a weapons policy for their respective campuses.\n \n In February, the board approved the policies, which at CSU-Pueblo banned weapons including concealed weapons, on campus and at all CSU sites.\n \n The CSU-Pueblo policy was drafted by President Joe Garcia and approved by the Faculty Senate and the student government.\n \n The policies were scheduled to be implemented by Aug. 1.\n \n With Wednesday's vote on the issue, the board has directed the individual campus presidents to work with attorneys to revise and implement a weapons control policy that is compliant with state law.\n \n Since the new policies have not been implemented, the campuses will continue to follow the state law that allows for individuals with a permit to carry concealed weapons to do so on campus.\n \n The residence halls are the only areas where weapons are prohibited.\n\n \n OUR VIEW: Gun bans start crumbling down (vote in poll) | univ - Opinion - Colorado Springs Gazette, CO\n \n \nThe dangerous new gun ban at Colorado State University is gone, thanks to a wise decision by the university's board of governor's Wednesday to rescind it.\n \n Gun bans remain at most other campuses in Colorado for now, including the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs. El Paso County Sheriff Terry Maketa said he will undermine the UCCS gun ban until it goes away.\n \n \"Nobody's coming into my jail on that charge,\" Maketa told The Gazette's editorial department. \"I will not cooperate with that in any way because in my view it's not a legitimate and arrestable offense.\"\n \n The Colorado State board rescinded its gun ban because of a ruling by The Colorado Court of Appeals April 15 that said the ban at another institution, the University of Colorado, violates the Colorado Concealed Carry Act of 2003. The ruling revives a lawsuit brought against CU by Students for Concealed Carry on Campus that had been dismissed last spring by El Paso County District Judge G. David Miller. The CU Board of Regents has not rescinded its ban and may appeal the appellate court's decision to the Colorado Supreme Court. The regents can appeal all they want and they will ultimately lose. What then?\n \n \"One has to comply with the law,\" said CU Regent Kyle Hybl, a Colorado Springs attorney.\n \n That means we can expect all state-campus gun bans to disappear in Colorado. They are illegal for good reason.\n \n \"The legislature protected concealed carry so that governing entities would not create safe havens for criminals,\" Maketa said. \"Gun bans tell criminals the risk is low. Criminals weigh risk versus reward, and they are comfortable with gun-free zones. We have more than 15,000 active concealed-carry permits in El Paso County and the number is growing. I like it when that gets out because it enters the mind of a criminal who's contemplating a crime against a person.\"\n \n The Legislature did nothing to exempt students or campuses from the protections of the Concealed Carry Act, and the appellate court accepted none of CU's arguments.\n \n \"This is a huge victory for law-abiding citizens,\" said Larimer County Sheriff James Alderden, whose county is home to the flagship campus of Colorado State.\n \n Alderden also planned to strategically undermine the gun ban in various ways. Now he won't have to.\n \n Campus gun bans get students killed because killers don't obey them. It's hard to know how the Virginia Tech massacre might have been different if all law-abiding adults hadn't been disarmed. We know that psychopath Seung-Hui Cho disobeyed the gun ban and killed 33 students over a span of nearly three hours without resistance because nobody within sight or earshot of the carnage was armed.\n \n Soon all campus gun bans will be gone in Colorado. Someday society may look back with disbelief regarding rules that made sitting ducks of young adults on campus.\n\n \n Looks like common sense is finally starting to come through.",

   "Danaher: Guns on campus will bring civility - Boulder Daily Camera\n \n \nOn April 15, Colorado Court of Appeals ruled that the University of Colorado has no authority to prevent people from carrying concealed weapons on campus. By the reactions of some, you'd have thought we were destined to see Wild West type shootouts. I think the reality is that we'll likely see more civility.\n \n In 1791, recognizing the natural right to self-preservation, the Second Amendment was ratified, and states in part, \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" Much debate has transpired about whether the amendment is really about a Militia. Logic appears to have prevailed in that it is established that the term \"the people,\" as in the other instances in the Constitution, means -- get this -- \"the people.\" You know, \"the right of the people peaceably to assemble\" and \"the right of the people to be secure in their persons.\"\n \n In 1970, failing to recognize the natural right to self-protection, CU banned all guns on campus, with the exception of law enforcement, and in 1994 banned concealed weapons. In 2003 Colorado passed the Concealed Carry Act (CCA), intended to standardize rules across the state, except in very specific locations, such as K-12 schools. CU then approached Attorney General Ken Salazar and he opined that the CCA did not apply to CU. A challenge was brought against CU and in April 2009, El Paso district judge David Miller dismissed it.\n \n In April the appellate court said, in effect, \"We don't think so.\"\n \n The first question is, if the 2003 CCA was passed, in part, to address CU's 1994 ban, why wouldn't it then apply to CU? And if the legislature didn't intend it to apply to college campuses, why wouldn't they have explicitly stated that, as they did K-12?\n \n CU attorney Patrick O'Rourke has claimed that the CCA doesn't apply because the Regents are not a governing body. Seemingly contradictory, Regent Michael Carrigan states that the Regents are \"independently elected and given broad authority.\" I don't think they can have it both ways. If you're elected, make policy, and have a jurisdiction, you're probably a government. Further, one of the express purposes of the CCA was to make the right to carry consistent in the many jurisdictions across the state. Seems to me that it exactly applies to CU.\n \n There are reports from some who claim they'd feel anxious knowing a fellow classmate may be packing. I would suggest that it might make more sense to worry about the wingnut who has a death wish. Why worry about the person who has put in the time to take a safety class, passed a background check and has paid the hundreds of dollars to get such a permit, and not worry about the one who's up to no good?\n \n Moreover, it should be considered that the mere knowledge of the possibility of a concealed carrier being present might dissuade the lunatic from commencing a real-life video game.\n \n When I hear some say we would all be safer if campus was a gun-free zone, I wonder if they really think the campus will really be gun-free just because we label it as such. Might it ever occur to those who are trying to make it gun-free that doing so makes it more inviting to those looking for easy pickings? Since these so called gun-free zones are only such to the law abiding, I agree with local Second Amendment expert David Kopel that it is more accurate to call them \"Pretend Gun-Free Zones.\"\n \n For those who favor a Pretend Gun-Free campus, I wonder where the empathy is for those whose rights are curtailed. Assuming one makes the faulty assumption that students are too immature to own a gun, how about the nearly 15,000 employees of the University? What about the distinguished professors, administrators, and staff? What about the petite woman walking home after the library closes and the huge thug waiting for her in the dark? Are their rights just collateral damage in the quest for a more perfect world?\n \n Even CSU seems to see the writing on the wall. On May 5, that Board of Governors, that \"governing body,\" rescinded a gun ban they unanimously just passed in February.\n \n When the case goes back to judge Miller, I hope he asks himself \"Who has the authority to deny their fellow countrymen the right to self-defense?\" And while we're at it, probably wouldn't be a bad question to pose to the Regents.\n",
