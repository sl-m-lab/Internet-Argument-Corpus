   "Many years ago, a bright young college student (yours truely) wrote a philosophical paper entitled \"Morals as a Biological Imperative.\" I won't force the good people on this forum to wade through the entire 40 pages, but the main idea has served me well for all these years when I have been tasked to answer the question from my religious friends: \"Without God, where do your morals come from?\"\n \n In light of the current political and social situation in America and the world today, this seems like a good time to explore this question once again.\n \n Accepting all the evidence at face value, and concluding that man has indeed evolved from more primitive life forms, it seems logical, even obvious, that what we refer to as \"morality\" is simply our expression of certain biological imperatives that have evolved along with us.\n \n To avoid all the subtlties and permutations delt with in the longer paper, let's boil down this illustration to \"good vs. evil.\"\n \n All succseful mutations leading to advancement along the evolutionary path incorporate certain \"biological imperatives\" required for the species to survive and prosper. These include things like the drive to procreate, fight or flight, the ability to evaluate energy expenditure vs. energy intake (choosing our food), etc. These things are common to almost all life.\n \n As a species, man has evolved into a social animal. All of our success is a result of this evolved condition. We have become the dominant life form on our planet because our social nature allows us to do things that would be impossible for individuals. The survival and continued evolutionary progress of our species depends upon this social structure.\n \n When some condition or action threatens this social structure, we instictively know that it is wrong. Being humans, and having evolved the ability to reason and think about such things, we have identified these things and labeled them. We call them \"evil.\" Murder, war, theft, disorder, etc. are all examples of things that threaten our social structure. We do not need to be told that these things are wrong; we know it because we have evolved to know it. Our biological imperatives react negatively to these things.\n \n Conversely, those actions and conditions that tend to support society, to make it safer and more comfortable, are identified as \"good.\" As a society, and as individuals, we tend to promote, support, and practice those things that we instinctivly know are \"good.\" Those things that allow us to continue to evolve and thrive.\n \n I won't get into the discussion of religion and how it tends to work against the \"good\" and attract \"evil.\" That is for another time; but for those who still feel that God is required to tell them what is \"good\" or \"evil,\" I'll let you attempt to answer this question:\n \n Long before the advent of any modern religion, those things we call good and evil had been identified and labeled as such; even codified in writing. Mankind has known for a long, long time, that murder, theft, disease, etc. are \"evil\" and has worked against them. Why?",

   "On a beach on the island of Floreana is a barrel which for more than a century has served as a mailbox. Originally a gentle conspiracy of sailors to exchange mail, it is now used by tourists. Everyone who visits Floreana leaves an unstamped post card or letter in the barrel, and takes any mail addressed to anyone close to home.\n \n God is not present and does not require this behavior. Floreana itself has a frightening legacy. For much of this century, it was inhabited by a handful of human beings, several of whom came to mysterious, suspicious ends. Others left the island; the sole survivor of those times still on the island is a woman who (until she became too old) was visited by many of the tours; her colorfulness rested on the fact that she could tell about murders, and that she was possibly the murderer herself. Neither God nor human justice was present on Floreana.\n \n But the mailbox survived. There is no evolutionary explanation for it: no-one who takes home and mails a letter will have more offspring. \n \n It is equally hard to say that Freud or Piaget participate in the success of the mailbox. The mailbox does not protect us against the unknown in the dark or the chaotic forces within ourselves. At most, one can say that it is a satisfying game, like marbles, where we rejoice in our cooperation; but, unlike marbles, it is a game played exactly once in the lives of most people who see it, and then it is almost certainly played with strangers. In fact, one will almost certainly never learn the identity of the person who mailed one's letter.\n \n The mailbox represents a Prisoner's Dilemma, where mailing each others' letters represents the maximum payoff for cooperation. But the mailbox should not work under the strict rules of the Prisoner's Dilemma, because there are no consequences for defection. Most tourists will never return to the mailbox, and defections are impossible to detect anyway; therefore, someone who leaves a letter but does not mail one will never be known and cannot be punished. But the mailbox continues anyway, decade after decade, and almost everyone who visits leaves a letter and mails one.\n \n The mailbox succeeds because it is a beautiful idea that appeals to everyone who learns about it. Everyone who visits wishes to participate in the success of the meme of the mailbox. It is the idea of the mailbox which causes the letters in it to be mailed.

   "very interesting. sorry to burst your bubble, but i dont think it will be possible for you to NOT \"get into the discussion of religion and how it tends to work against the \"good\" and attract \"evil.\"\" ;)\n \n i'm very interested in hearing your thesis about how religion contribute to evil and inhibits good\n\n \n I'm at work right now, so I can't give this subject the attention it deserves at the moment. However, it would be cheap of me to ignore it altogether, so I'll give you a brief synopsis:\n \n Religion, in it's most primitive form, is simply an attempt to explain those things which we do not understand. The most basic of these things is \"where do we come from?\" We were \"created\" by _______(enter your favorite god/gods). \n By creating a creator, we create a being in our own image; a being with thoughts and emotions. This being therefore, must have had a purpose in creating us (we would not have undertaken such a task without a reason), ergo, he/she/it/they must want us to know what that reason is. How to communicate that reason? Enter the priest/prophet/shaman.\n Now we have someone or some group that speaks for god - the ultimate power and arbitor of good and evil.\n This is a phenomenal amount of power to place in the hands of any person or group. The temptation to use it for personal gain (money, power, shaping society to your personal preference) is, eventually, too much for our instincive drive to better our own condition. Modern religion is a good example of this process.\n Another problem with religion is that it is a powerful weapon for use of the biological imperative that drives us to compete for dominance with other social groups (our genes must be passed on. By extension, our ideas must alsd be passed). The result is a history of war, murder, corruption, and division because of religion. \n Groups that would otherwise join forces for their own good are instead driven to kill each other by their religious leaders.\n \n Sorry that this is such a simplification of a very complex issue. I'll be happy to continue this discussion and elaborate on this idea over time.",

Yes, but it has been for quite some time.

The number of teeth a person has. Some people don't get wisdom teeth. With our generally soft diet the muscles of the jaw aren't as strong as they once were. Thus they require less bone to anchor them and thus our jaws are smaller than they once were. This leaves too little room for the lower wisdom teeth. Even with modern dentistry and antibiotics, it still is not unheard of that someone will die from infection, reaction to anesthesia, or some unknown factor that causes the heart to stop.
