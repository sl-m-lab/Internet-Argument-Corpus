Second of all, if your kid died in a war and you wanted it ended, wouldn't you use the death for your political agenda? You don't hesitate to use the other person for your political agenda (told her off, saying we're winning). She is trying to save other parents the pain of that for what (in her eyes) is a lost cause. But I still say her stand didn't do much. She tried to get people mad at Bush for not meeting with her when he had already met with her. She was doing (at least I think) an honorable thing for a (what she thought was a) noble cause, but that doesn't persuade me or anyone else that the war is a bad thing. I still think stunts like this don't help anything but get people further apart. Anti-war people call her a hero, pro-war people get mad at her and we have another fight. I doubt she persuaded a single person who was pro-war to think that the war was a bad idea. I don't think she helped herself any, but I do think her motives were good.",

Quadaffi neverhad any nukes. He had a research program that he has offered 9 times since 1990 to dismantle in return for economic aid and assistance.

Giap: Kerry's Group Helped Hanoi Defeat U.S. \n The North Vietnamese general in charge of the military campaign that finally drove the U.S. out of South Vietnam in 1975 credited a group led by Democratic presidential front-runner John Kerry with helping him achieve victory. \n In his 1985 memoir about the war, Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap wrote that if it weren't for organizations like Kerry's Vietnam Veterans Against the War, Hanoi would have surrendered to the U.S. - according to Fox News Channel war historian Oliver North.\n http://www.archive-news.net/Kerry/JK_timeline.html\n March 4, 1973 Maj. Kenneth Cordier, is Air Force pilot who was in Vietnamese custody for 2,284 days. He said his captors \"repeated incessantly\" John Kerry's one-liner about being \"the last man to die\" for a lost cause. Cordier was released March 4, 1973. He is among many with similar stories. (1 - 2) \"This man committed an act of treason. He lied, he besmirched our name and he did it for self-interest. And now he wants us to forget.\"(Excerpt from \"Stolen Honor\") -- George (Bud) Day,Former Vietnam POW \n April 1973 Jane Fonda calls the freed American prisoners \"hypocrites and pawns,\" insisting that, \"Tortured men do not march smartly off planes, salute the flag, and kiss their wives. They are liars. I also want to say that these men are not heroes.\"\n \n When you got home, you co-founded Vietnam Veterans Against the War and wrote \"The New Soldier,\" which denounced those of us who served -- and were still serving -- on the battlefields of a thankless war. Worst of all, John, you then accused me -- and all of us who served in Vietnam -- of committing terrible crimes and atrocities.\n On April 22, 1971, under oath, you told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that you had knowledge that American troops \"had personally raped, cut off ears, cut off heads, taped wires from portable telephones to human genitals and turned up the power, cut off limbs, blown up bodies, randomly shot at civilians, razed villages in fashion reminiscent of Genghis Khan, shot cattle and dogs for fun, poisoned food stocks, and generally ravaged the country side of South Vietnam.\" And you admitted on television that \"yes, yes, I committed the same kind of atrocities as thousands of other soldiers have committed.\"\n And for good measure you stated, \"(America is) more guilty than any other body, of violations of (the) Geneva Conventions ... the torture of prisoners, the killing of prisoners.\"\n Your \"antiwar\" statements and activities were painful for those of us carrying the scars of Vietnam and trying to move on with our lives. And for those who were still there, it was even more hurtful. But those who suffered the most from what you said and did were the hundreds of American prisoners of war being held by Hanoi. Here's what some of them endured because of you, John:\n Capt. James Warner had already spent four years in Vietnamese custody when he was handed a copy of your testimony by his captors. Warner says that for his captors, your statements \"were proof I deserved to be punished.\" He wasn't released until March 14, 1973.\n Maj. Kenneth Cordier, an Air Force pilot who was in Vietnamese custody for 2,284 days, says his captors \"repeated incessantly\" your one-liner about being \"the last man to die\" for a lost cause. Cordier was released March 4, 1973.\n Navy Lt. Paul Galanti says your accusations \"were as demoralizing as solitary (confinement) ... and a prime reason the war dragged on.\" He remained in North Vietnamese hands until February 12, 1973.\n John, did you think they would forget? When Tim Russert asked about your claim that you and others in Vietnam committed \"atrocities,\" instead of standing by your sworn testimony, you confessed that your words \"were a bit over the top.\" Does that mean you lied under oath? Or does it mean you are a war criminal? You can't have this one both ways, John. Either way, you're not fit to be a prison guard at Abu Ghraib, much less commander in chief.",

I think she is as insignificant as a gnat on an elephants :xcensored . She needs to be bent over and butt :xcensored . She has already had more attention than she deserves so I will stop there.\n \n And, as far as Lurch Kerry goes, if he came back, after experiencing what he witnessed first hand, and protested in the manner he did, I could respect that. But I personally think he was laying the foundation for a long political carreer and his motives were self serving. Again, insignificant. The guy's a bozo.\n \n Proclaiming to be a patriot as I am as well as a veteran, I am the first to admit that when I served, I was non-political and I would have blown Tennesee off the map if given the order. I didn't care. Orders were orders.\n \n But I am older now. I have children that I love very much. A grand kid too. I would imagine that the parents who have lost their children in Iraq love theirs as much as I love mine. It is for these children that I voice my dissent. Granted, you won't see me getting chummy with some raghead terrorist, but as long as I am alive, and I can type, you will find me here or there protesting something that I strongly believe to be a Bush agenda at the costs of OUR children and NOT his. I am more than positive that history will prove me right.\n \n If this was a Pearl Harbour scenerio, I would be behind it 100%. But I submit, as the world is my witness, the day the Bush-o-cons, call on me to offer my children in sacrifice to their BS war agendas, will be the day I pack up my kids and head north. Way north. I will look in my rearview and watch the US disappear as I offer a one-finger salute to a nation gone awry.\n \n Some things are worth dying for, I suppose. But Iraq is not. I know that might **** off someone who has already made the ultimate sacrifice as they are trying to garner some sense of validity and worth over their loss. But it is what it is. Iraq was a lie. We all pretty much realize that now. But as Bassman says, \"What do we do now? Tuck and run?\" We can thank Bush and Cheny and Halliburton for this mess.

   " we are winning the war in Iraq.\n\n \n http://www.lewrockwell.com/roberts/roberts123.html\n \n \nThe \"cakewalk war\" is now two and one-half years old. US casualties (dead and wounded) number 20,000. As 20,000 is the number of Iraqi insurgents according to US military commanders, each insurgent is responsible for one US casualty.\n \n US troops in Iraq number about 150,000. Obviously, US troops have not inflicted 150,000 casualties on the Iraqi insurgents. US troops have perhaps inflicted 150,000 casualties on the Iraqi civilian population, primarily women and children who are the \"collateral damage\" of the \"righteous\" and \"virtuous\" US invasion that is spreading civilian deaths all over Mesopotamia in the name of democracy.\n\n \n They have a 1:1 ratio of Iraqi insurgent to US casualty.\n We have a 1:1 ratio of US soldier to Iraqi civilian casualty.\n \n Is this a tie?\n \n\n The combination of US government owned ammo plants and those of US commercial producers together cannot make bullets as fast as US troops are firing them. The Bush administration has had to turn to foreign producers such as Israel Military Industries. Think about that. Hollowed out US industry cannot produce enough ammunition to defeat a 20,000 man insurgency.\n\n \n Maybe they'll run out of ammo before we do.\n \n \nUS military analysts are beginning to wonder if the US has been defeated by the insurgency. Increasingly, Bush administration spokesmen sound like \"Baghdad Bob.\" On September 19 the Washington Post reported that US military spinmeister Major General Rich Lynch declared \"great success\" against the insurgency that had just inflicted the worst casualties of the war, including a three-day mortar attack on the \"safe\" Green Zone.\n\n \n Yes, compare US officials to deluded Baghdad Bob, anybody got the DVD?\n \n \nAnthony Cordesman, a military expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC, says: \"We can't secure the airport road, can't stop the incoming (mortar rounds) into the Green Zone, can't stop the killings and kidnappings.\" The insurgency controls most of Baghdad and the Sunni provinces.\n\n But we're winning still right?\n \n \n\n According to news reports, at Ted Forstmann's annual meeting of movers and shakers last weekend, US Ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, predicted that US troops will soon enter into Syria. Simultaneously, the Bush administration is desperately trying to orchestrate a case that it can use to attack Iran.\n\n \n And look who wrote the thing.\n \n\n Dr. Roberts is John M. Olin Fellow at the Institute for Political Economy and Research Fellow at the Independent Institute. He is a former associate editor of the Wall Street Journal, former contributing editor for National Review, and a former assistant secretary of the U.S. Treasury. \n\n \n Yeah WSJ and National Review are so left wing.",

   "Explain to me how we should handle the war on terror? Explain to me why you think we should appease these wahabbiist nutjobs? Explain to me how OBL's capture would stop terrorism on our soil, when they are present throughout the world?\n\n \n First, we should probably keep after Bin Laden becuase he is out there plotting more attacks and he is one fo the few people in the world with the experience, connections, financial resources, and supply network, to pull off a really big attack, like a nuke in manhattan. The fact that he has pulled off several attacks against the US, each progressively bigger, makes him a serious threat. \n \n Second, he has become a symbol of anti american militarism, and a sucessful one. If we can bring down that symbol, we strike a major PR blow to the opposition.\n \n As far as how we should fight the war on terror, the first thing I would do is require that Us foreign policy be based on constitutional principals. For example, we would no longer be allowed to provide significant support to totalitarian, tyrannical regimes like the house of saud. We would no longer be allowed to give blind support to the racist policies of the israelis, or provide them significant support as long as such policies are in place. I know, it is a radical suggestion, but you wil find that if we stop assuming that the \"natural rights\" enjoyed by americans are only \"natural rights\" for americans. I know we cannot gaurantee rights for everybody on the planet, but we also don't have to actively support tyrants.\n \n Frankly, if we made JUST this change, close to 40% of the totalitarian governemtnes on the planet would fall. This would go a LONG ways towards doing away with the problem of terrorism, since the majority of Anti-US terrorist groups iclude in their list of grievances against the US the fact thta we are supporting totalitarian regimes.",

There are nearly 1000 ethnic groups in the world who have no definable homeland.

They survive ONLY becuase the Us shows up frequently with a big bag of gold. It always surprises me to hear those like yourself who are anti welfare advocate our handling of Israel, where we provide the equivelent of $20,000 per year for every man, woman and child in the country. That is welfare on a national scale.\n \n the truth of the matter is, no businessman in his right mind is willing to do business in israel, partially because of their internal problems, partly becuase of their problems with their neiborghs, but mostly becuase israel has a long and well documented history of screwing internationl companies that do business there. The minute it becomes profitable for the israelis to cancel your contract, or steal your IP and assign it to an israeli owned company, they will do it, leaving you in the cold. Then you are stuck trying to fight the case in an israeli court, where foreign corporations have no contract rights. \n \n For all the BS that gets passed about israel, the truth of the matter is that without the palestnian conflict and the problems ith their neiborghs, they would have ceased to exist years ago. Only though a continual state of war and civil strife can they continue to claim a right to US aid (a right that no other nation on the planet is arrogant enough to claim). You could safely say that the primary business of israel is conflict. Without it, they would have withered and died as an entity years ago.\n \n If you feel the jews need a homeland, give them the south pole. Give them the north pole for all I care. I personally want no part in their racist policies, and feel absolutly no need to send billions of dollars of US taxpayers money there to subsidize a nation that cannot possibly survive on its own and must rely on continous conflict to supply foreign aid.",

But previously revealed records indicate the future senator made two, and possibly three, trips to Paris. \n \n At the subsequent press conference in Washington, Kerry surrounded himself with the families of POWs, a strategy espoused in the recovered communist circular. \n \n The Kerry campaign has not responded to WND's request for a response to the discovery of the two documents. \n \n The third document shows that when Madame Binh came to Paris in 1969 with the North Vietnamese delegation, Hanoi was directing its propaganda efforts toward winning the hearts and minds of South Vietnamese. \n \n But the communist regime began to realize in 1970 and early 1971 that it could not defeat the U.S. militarily, and so the target of propaganda shifted to the antiwar movement in an attempt to erode resolve on the American homefront. \n \n Then Hanoi launched a series of coordinated efforts, leading to Kerry's press conference. \n \n \"The series of dates and actions hardly look coincidental,\" said Corsi. \n \n \n Vietnamese Communist Party leader Le Duc Tho delivered to Paris a plan promoted by John Kerry. \n \n In the last week of June 1971, Le Duc Tho - the second most powerful communist leader, next to Ho Chi Minh - arrived in Paris as a special counsel to the Vietnamese delegations. \n \n On July 1, closely on the heels of Le's arrival, Madame Binh delivered the seven-point plan to U.S. Ambassador David Bruce in Paris. \n \n A New York Times report at that time specifically noted the plan came after Tho's arrival. \n \n The plan was presented not through the head of the delegation, Xuan Thuy, but through the Viet Cong leader, Madame Binh, who first met with Kerry in the summer of 1970. \n \n Twenty-one days later, Kerry was in Washington advancing Madame Binh's proposal, which would force President Nixon to set a date to end the war and withdraw troops. Hanoi cleverly constructed the plan so that the only barrier to release of American POWs was Nixon's unwillingness to set a withdrawal date, but it amounted to a virtual surrender that included payment of reparations and an admission the U.S. was the aggressor in an immoral war. \n \n \"When President Nixon got this peace plan, the White House didn't know what to do,\" Corsi said. \"It was an entirely new initiative.\" \n \n The White House sent Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to Paris July 12, and seven days later, the South Vietnamese submitted a counterproposal to enact a total cease-fire and put the issue of reunification to a nationwide vote. \n \n \"In the middle of these intense negotiations and posturing to Madame Binh's proposal, Kerry volunteered to hold a press conference advocating the Viet Cong leader's position,\" Corsi explained. \n \n \"He had no role to insert himself in this process,\" he asserted. \"Nixon and Kissinger were trying to deal with a difficult negotiating situation.\" \n \n In an article on the press conference, the New York Times noted POW families were upset because it appeared Kerry, who had dropped out of a bid for a seat in Congress, was motivated by his own political aspirations, using the event as a springboard to political office. \n \n When Kerry began to introduce relatives of prisoners who stood beside him behind the microphones, he was met with the fierce objections of four wives of POWs in the audience. \n \n The women shouted to Kerry, \"That's a lie,\" and \"What office are you going to run for next?\" \n \n The Times said one of the POW wives accused Kerry of \"constantly using our own suffering and grief \" for his political ambitions. \n \n When asked if he planned to run again for political office, the Times reported Kerry replied only that \"he was committed to political change and he would use whatever forum seemed best at the time.\" \n \n The captured Vietnamese circular stated that previously, the dissent among U.S. military personnel largely existed only in the Army, but had expanded to the Air Force. \n \n Kerry's use of Air Force POW families helped spread the dissent in a concerted way, Corsi maintained, getting the relatives to accept Binh's proposal and say, \"Let's put an end to this.\" \n \n The circular said the peace plan \"not only solved problems concerning the release of U.S. prisoners but also motivated the people of all walks of life and even relatives of U.S. pilots detained in [North Vietnam] to participate in the antiwar movement.\" \n \n \"Kerry, by holding the press conference, supports the argument that the antiwar movement is behind this plan,\" Corsi said. \n \n The media event, consistent with plans developed and delivered in Hanoi, was \"designed to have maximum impact emotionally on the antiwar community in the U.S.,\" he emphasized. \n \n Corsi said the Kerry campaign's silence on the new discovery of the documents mirrors its unwillingness to respond to the charges of \"Unfit for Command\" until it was obvious the presidential candidate was suffering political damage. \n \n \"The charges in the new documents have been out there for a full day,\" he pointed out. \"Had the documents not been authentic, the Kerry camp would have been all over them, to discredit them.\" \n \n Previous story: \n \n Discovered documents: Hanoi directed Kerry\n \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Art Moore is a news editor with WorldNetDaily.com. \n \n \n \n http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=41062\n \n http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=38738\n \n http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=38535\n \n http://members.aol.com/ga1449ga/links/links.html",

Yet some people hang on to a dream status, blaming everything but the actual reasons for our defeats, cursing individuals who bring our failures to the public eye.\nWe got our butts kicked because it was a political toy for Kennedy/Johnson to play with. Instead of releasing our military to defeat the enemy, we had rules of engagement that tied one hand behind our back...along with strong anti-war sentiment and sedition on the part of well known people like Fonda and Kerry.\n \n The Vietnamese know that we could have beat them if we'd just blocked the Ho Chi Min trail. But, Johnson wouldn't have it that way.",

(I read another article that said the same thing.)\n \n I fail to see how my claims in this thread have anything to do with why we got into any of the conflicts you mentioned. I'm not for domino unprovoked invasions of countries we don't like. I'm just in favor of going full speed ahead and winning instead of pacifying some political opponents. We should have won in Vietnam...We should have destroyed Saddam Hussien during the Persian Gulf war. According to Bui Tin, we almost did win a conditional surrender from NV. It's John Kerry and Jane Fonda and all the other frontpage protestors that cost us many lives and an overall victory.\n \n Your generalizations are meaningless.",

   "quoting a Vietnamese official saying that they were considering a conditional surrender until they learned of all the anti-war protesting.\n \n http://www.washtimes.com/commentary/20040415-090923-9426r.htm\n \n With the Viet Cong wiped out in the Tet offensive, North Vietnamese regulars moved south down the Ho Chi Minh trails through Laos and Cambodia to continue the war. Even Giap admitted in his memoirs that news media reporting of the war and the antiwar demonstrations that ensued in America surprised him. Instead of negotiating what he called a conditional surrender, Giap said they would now go the limit because America's resolve was weakening and the possibility of complete victory was within Hanoi's grasp.\n\n \n While that editorial is certainly an interesting bit of revisionist hisotry, it is complete and utter BS. After the tet offensive, the war was lost. The guy who wrote the article was correc that casualties were not high for S vitnamese troops, while they were for N vietnamese troops, the contention that teh viet cong was essentially wiped out is rediculous. the tet offensive was caarried out by N vietnamese regualr infantry. To the best of the knowledge of the US, there were no VC troops involved in the tet offesive, they were all N vietnamese regular army.\n \n Second, the south vietnames and americans lost over $400 billion in equipment and facilities. The south vietnamese expended ove 70% of the ammunition they had in the country. It wold have taken them months, if not years, to rebuild their military infrastructure to pre-tet levels. In that time, the VC, who were guerilla fighters, would have decimated the S vietnamese. \n \n There is little or no doubt that we could have won the war if we had taken it full scale into laos. We would have won the war if we had nuked SE asia off the map as well. the price of such a victory would have overshadowed it inherint usefullness,though. The PR factor involved in such an event would have been enormous. Nations would have been running to the soviets for protection from the US if we had started a policy of invasion. \n \n Now the situation is a little different in Iraq. we have already started a policy of invasion, and as a result, we have permanently lost our bases in Sadi arabia, Kuwait has limited our movements at our bases there to essentially nothing, and Iran, Iraq ans Syria, with russian backing, have formed a treaty allinace with the sole purpose of defending against the US. \n \n Now, the question is, are we going to end up in a vietnam type situation where we loose tousands before cooler heads at home prevail and we admit that we have no business there and a victory is pretty much meaninless in the long run, or do we have to loose those troops, and the money that goes with a large scale, long term war on multiple fronts?\n \n What gets me about the whoel situation is the arrogance of not only US leaders in this case, but so many Us citizens as well. The assuption that if we removed the current regime the Iraqis would automatically flock to pick up our way of life and our system of government is just dripping with arrogance. The people of the Us need to recognize that while we may like our system and believe it is the best thing going, others may feel differently, and at the end of the day, forcing the issue is pretty much the exact opposite of the self determination we are claiming to be providing.\n \n Quit frankly, a society in the ME, where there is really only one resource worth mentioning, should probably be a socialist one. Otherwise you end up with a nation like saudi arabia where a very few are billionairs, and everybody else is a peasant. Also, to people used to tribal government, a burecratic democracy is probably a pretty poor choice, but that is what we are forcing them to adopt.",

Yeah, yeah, I know, Osama Bin Laden, yada,yada,yada. But if you peaceniks recall. Not long after the attacks, President Bush stated that Iraq was on the hit list of state-sponsered terrorism.
