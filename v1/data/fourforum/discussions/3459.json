   "Has anybody else absorbed what GWB is saying when he talks about his \"Health Care Plan\"?\n \n From GWB's website:\n \n \nExpand Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) - President Bush will propose a tax credit for low-income families  and individuals to purchase health insurance, or to purchase a low-premium, high-deductible  health plan and an HSA. Families will receive up to $2,000 for their premiums and $1,000 cash to put in their HSAs to help meet the deductible. Individuals will receive up to $700 for their premiums and $300 for their HSAs. \n\n \n Does GWB actually think that an entire family can buy health insurance and pay high deductibles on $3000? Translation: the government will tell the citizens what kind of bank account they need to get to save up for their own health costs -- then pay it yourself. We constantly hear that a major reason for the increase in health care costs is the cost of the uninsured. How does it help it tell low-income/unemployed/minimum wage workers to save their money? Once again, businesses will love this. Don't offer health insurance to employees - they're self insured. Or they can get it themselves through their church!?!?\n \n \nPromote a Health Savings Account Tax Credit to Help Small Business Employees - President Bush will propose a tax credit for HSA contributions to help individuals and families who work for small businesses fund their HSAs.  Small businesses and their employees who set up an HSA will get a tax rebate for contributions to the HSA of up to $500 per worker with family coverage and $200 per worker with individual coverage. \n\n \n Repeat of what I just said. Now, speaking of big government. The government gives money, although not near enough money, to every employee of a small business.\n \n \nProvide an Above-the-Line Deduction for Health Insurance Premiums - President Bush has proposed to allow individuals who purchase low-premium, high-deductible insurances policies to deduct the premiums they pay for these policies. It will reduce the net cost of these policies and encourage the use of HSAs for saving for health care needs and making wise, cost-effective health care choices. \n\n \n Yeah! Just don't go to the doctor so much - because their is no insurance for office visits.\n \n \nAllow Small Businesses to Establish Association Health Plans (AHPs) - While large businesses can use their purchasing power to get better deals from insurance companies, smaller firms often find that coverage is priced beyond their reach. To give small employers and their workers more purchasing power, the President has proposed allowing small businesses to band together and negotiate on behalf of their employees and their families. \n\n \n \nExpand Association Health Plans - President Bush supports AHP expansion so that people who purchase coverage on their own can buy health insurance from a group other than an employer. This would allow civic and charitable groups, churches, and other types of organizations to offer health insurance to their members. \n\n \n Faith based insurance now.\n \n \nAllow Shopping for Health Coverage Across State Lines - Today it's easy to use the Internet or toll-free numbers to shop for products. But different rules apply to health insurance. Consumers can only purchase health insurance in the state in which they live, and can't shop around for a better deal in another state. The President proposes giving people the freedom to shop across state lines to find the best rates for their health coverage. \n\n \n Speaking of states rights - insurance is STATE regulated. Anybody want to get into a states rights debate on this one?\n \n I don't really see any changes here - at least not for the good. We already have this system - pre-tax payroll deductions that can be used for deductibles. GWB just wants to expand it BIG TIME and give employers an out when they offer lousy or no coverage. GWB's entire plan to reduce costs - don't sue anybody. And GWB's best advice to the poor - save your money.",
