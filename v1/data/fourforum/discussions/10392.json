Ever since the early 1900s, biologists have thought about heredity primarily in terms of genes. Today, they often view genes as compact, information-laden gems hidden among billions of bases of junk DNA. But genes, it turns out, are neither compact nor uniquely important. According to a painstaking new analysis of 1% of the human genome, genes can be sprawling, with far-flung protein-coding and regulatory regions that overlap with other genes.\n \n Figure 1 DNA work. For Ewan Birney, coordinating 300 authors to analyze 1% of the human genome (graphic, blue bars) was a rewarding challenge.\n \n CREDITS (LEFT TO RIGHT): PHOTOLAB AT EMBL; GALT BARBER/UCSC\n \n As part of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, 35 research teams have analyzed 44 regions of the human genome covering 30 million bases and figured out how each base contributes to overall genome function. The results, compiled in a paper in the 14 June issue of Nature and 28 papers in the June issue of Genome Research, provide a litany of new insights and drive home how complex our genetic code really is. For example, protein-coding DNA makes up barely 2% of the overall genome, yet 80% of the bases studied showed signs of being expressed, says Ewan Birney of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory's European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton, U.K., who led the ENCODE analysis.\n \n Given the traditional gene-centric perspective, that finding \"is going to be very disturbing to some people,\" says John Greally, a molecular biologist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. On the other hand, says Francis Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) in Bethesda, Maryland, \"we're beginning to understand the ground rules by which the genome functions.\"\n \n Once the human genome sequence was in hand by 2003, NHGRI set up ENCODE to learn what those 3 billion or so bases were all about. The initial 4-year, $42 million effort, which tackled 1% of the human genome, brought new and existing experimental and computational approaches to bear, mapping not just genes but also regulatory DNA and other important features such as gene start sites. NHGRI now plans to spend about $23 million annually over the next 4 years to perform a similar analysis of the whole genome, expecting that the lessons learned from the pilot ENCODE and new sequencing technologies will greatly reduce the costs of this extended project (Science, 25 May, p. 1120). \"The goal is to measure all the different kinds of features across the human genome and ask which features go together to understand the whole package,\" says George Weinstock, a geneticist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas.\n \n A key component of the pilot ENCODE is an analysis of the \"transcriptome,\" the repertoire of RNA molecules that cells create by transcribing DNA. For protein-coding genes, most of their RNA transcripts--the messenger RNA (mRNA)--get translated into chains of amino acids by ribosomes. For other types of \"genes,\" RNA is the end product: Ribosomal RNAs become the backbone of the ribosome, for example.\n \n Researchers used to think very little RNA was produced beyond mRNA and a smattering of RNA end products. But about half the transcripts that molecular biologist Thomas Gingeras of Affymetrix Inc. in Santa Clara, California, discovered in his RNA survey 2 years ago didn't fit into these categories (Science, 20 May 2005, p. 1149), a finding ENCODE has now substantiated. The ENCODE researchers knew going in that the DNA they were studying produced about eight non-protein-coding RNAs, and they have now discovered thousands more. \"A lot more of the DNA [is] turning up in RNA than most people would have predicted,\" says Collins.\n \n ENCODE has produced few clues as to what these RNAs do--leaving some to wonder whether experimental artifacts inflated the percentage of DNA transcribed. Greally is satisfied that ENCODE used enough different techniques to show that the RNA transcripts are real, but he's not sure they're biologically important. \"It's possible some of these transcripts are just the polymerase [enzyme] chugging along like an Energizer bunny\" and transcribing extra DNA, he suggests.\n \n But in the 8 June issue of Science (p. 1484), Gingeras and his colleagues reported that many of the mysterious RNA transcripts found as part of ENCODE harbor short sequences, conserved across mice and humans, that are likely important in gene regulation. That these transcripts are \"so diverse and prevalent across the genome just opens up the complexity of this whole system,\" says Gingeras.\n \n The mRNA produced from protein-coding genes also held surprises. When Alexandre Reymond, a medical geneticist at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, and his colleagues took a close look at the 400 protein-coding genes contained in ENCODE's target DNA, they found additional exons--the regions that code for amino acids--for more than 80%. Many of these newfound exons were located thousands of bases away from the gene's previously known exons, sometimes hidden in another gene. Moreover, some mRNAs were derived from exons belonging to two genes, a finding, says Reymond, that \"underscores that we have still not truly answered the question, 'What is a gene?' \" In addition, further extending and blurring gene boundaries, ENCODE uncovered a slew of novel \"start sites\" for genes--the DNA sequences where transcription begins--many located hundreds of thousands of bases away from the known start sites.\n \n Before ENCODE started, researchers knew of about 532 promoters, regulatory DNA that helps jump-start gene activity, in the human DNA chosen for analysis. Now they have 775 in hand, with more awaiting verification. Unexpectedly, about one-quarter of the promoters discovered were at the ends of the genes instead of at the beginning.\n \n The distributions of exons, promoters, gene start sites, and other DNA features and the existence of widespread transcription suggest that a multidimensional network regulates gene expression. Gingeras contends that because of this complexity, researchers should look at RNA transcripts and not genes as the fundamental functional units of genomes. But Collins is more circumspect. The gene \"is a concept that's not going out of fashion,\" he predicts. \"It's just that we have to be more thoughtful about it.\" \n",

Carefully note what the authors have to say.\n \n \n \n \n Originally published in Science Express on 17 May 2007\n Science 8 June 2007:\n Vol. 316. no. 5830, pp. 1484 - 1488\n DOI: 10.1126/science.1138341\n \n Prev | Table of Contents | Next\n Reports\n RNA Maps Reveal New RNA Classes and a Possible Function for Pervasive Transcription\n Philipp Kapranov,1 Jill Cheng,1 Sujit Dike,1 David A.

Gingeras1*\n \n Significant fractions of eukaryotic genomes give rise to RNA, much of which is unannotated and has reduced protein-coding potential. The genomic origins and the associations of human nuclear and cytosolic polyadenylated RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides (nt) and whole-cell RNAs less than 200 nt were investigated in this genome-wide study. Subcellular addresses for nucleotides present in detected RNAs were assigned, and their potential processing into short RNAs was investigated. Taken together, these observations suggest a novel role for some unannotated RNAs as primary transcripts for the production of short RNAs. Three potentially functional classes of RNAs have been identified, two of which are syntenically conserved and correlate with the expression state of protein-coding genes. These data support a highly interleaved organization of the human transcriptome.\n\n \n And the introductory paragraph is interesting also.\n \n \n \nA large fraction of the noncoding part of a eukaryotic genome is used to make RNA that is sufficiently stable in a cell to be detected by different technological approaches (1-4). The biological significance of this pervasive transcription is unclear and controversial. One possibility is that only very short regions of such unannotated RNA are biologically relevant (5). In-depth characterization of RNAs as to their subcellular compartmentalization, size, modifications, and genomic origins can potentially provide clues to their functions. This study reports two general observations derived from the maps of nuclear and cytosolic polyadenylated [poly(A)+] RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides (nt) (long RNAs, lRNAs) and whole-cell RNAs less than 200 nt (short RNAs, sRNAs) over the entire nonrepetitive portion of the human genome. First, the potential biological function of an appreciable portion of long unannotated transcripts is to serve as precursors for sRNAs. Second, these maps reveal three classes of RNAs that have specific genomic localization at gene boundaries. Biological relevance of these classes of RNAs is supported by strong correlation with the expression state of genes they associate with, as well as their syntenic conservation between human and mouse.\n\n \n Those who care enough to read the above and understand what the authors have studied will hardly jump on the bandwagon and declare that Genes are Dead.",

If humans cannot define genes then its not because of how genes evolved - the limit lies within us not the genes. Many many information storage systems by the way do not store things in a contiguous sequential manner, indeed its inefficient to do so! Do you know for example how your files are stored on your hard drive? Why do you think fragmentation is allowed? Why do you think that physical and logical sectors do not correspond?",

   "Oh yes one of the things you seem to have overlooked is that none of the transcripts which are spread out or separated greatly are coding for protein - but only for RNA of various sorts. The article appearing in Science Jun8 this year concludes as follows.\n \n \nOther recent studies also report the presence of multiple transcripts at the 5' boundaries of genes (9), including unstable lRNAs postulated to be involved in regulation of gene expression (10, 11). Thus, these results suggest a model of genome organization where protein-coding genes are at the center of a complex network of overlapping sense and antisense lRNA transcription, with interleaved sRNAs often marking their boundaries and correlating with their expression state (fig. S14). Our studies also highlight a possible important biological function for a portion of unannotated nuclear transcription as possible precursors for sRNAs. Such interleaved transcription produces a variety of non-protein coding sRNA and lRNA species that offer cis- and trans-regulatory potential (12-14).\n",
