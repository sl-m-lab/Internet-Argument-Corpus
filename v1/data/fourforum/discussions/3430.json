   "A hint obout the inevitable civil war?\nMaybe civil war will erupt in Iraq. Maybe it won't. Time will tell, but it seems premature to say civil war is inevitable.\n \n \nIn our mandated Western-syle Iraqi democracy, Kurds will be suborned to majority Shia representation.\nThe word 'suborned' makes no sense in this context. Perhaps you meant to imply that the minority Kurds will be subordinate to the majority Shiites. If that was your intent, the problem with that suggestion is that such subservience undercuts your argument against \"our mandated Western-style democracy,\" since subservience is not consistent with democracy, where minority rights are not relegated to inferior rank.\n \n Speaking of democracy, it's not clear how you distinguish between \"Western-style democracy\" and other democratic styles. Can there be democracy without free elections, the rule of law, civil rights, civil society, and economic liberalization? What dimensions of democracy, in your view, are useful in differentiating Western-style from Arab-style? Or from whatever alternate democratic style you have in mind?\n \n Historically, the U.S. did little to promote democracy in the Arab world after WW2, despite the remarkable transformation of Germany and Japan from autocratic rivals to democractic allies. During the Cold War years, U.S. foreign policy was mostly driven by attempts to thwart Soviet influence and to empower forces that favored American trade and investment. Such policy explains why anti-communist authoritarian regimes that adopted liberal economic policies often received American backing.\n \n But that policy began to change with the Reagan adminstration. His ideological challenge to the Soviets was framed in terms of democracy and individual freedom. Diplomatic support was extended to civil society groups like Solidarity in Poland. American pressure also facilitated democratic transitions in both Chile and the Philippines in the 1980s. The idea that democracies shared a natural harmony of interests encouraged the transformation of official American views on promoting democracy. With the Soviet collapse, our interest in foreign allies became more focused on open markets than anti-Communism. Authoritarian regimes had often been reliable trade partners, but they were not well suited to the development of mature market economies, which require transparent and accountable government authority.\n \n Bill Clinton further evolved this line of thinking into his 'democratic enlargement' doctrine, which held that the spread of democracy advances American interests because democracies are less likely to go to war with each other, less likely to sponsor terrorism, less likely to unleash waves of refugees, more likely to honor treaties, more likely to abide by international law, more likely to protect the global environment, and more likely to be lucrative trade partners.\n \n Half the world's countries are democracies, yet none of the 22 Arab countries is among them. During the Cold War, the American approach to the Middle East was to foster stability in order to prevent the spread of Soviet influence, ensure the supply of oil, and provide security for Israel. The American strategy was management through autocratic leaders and a \"don't rock the boat\" approach.\n \n After 9/11 it became ever more clear that a new strategy was needed. Outwardly pro-American autocratic governments, such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt, are not capable of serving as an effective bulwark against Islamist terrorism. By placing the promotion of democracy in the Arab world at the center of our Mideast policy, we may be pursuing an agenda that's overly idealistic and doomed to eventual failure. Or we may find that it proved to be a progressive policy that successfully transforms that vital region into one of hope and prosperity.",

That includes Kurd demands that Arabic ethnic groups, who at Saddam's insistence settled in what Kurds consider their territory, return what they consider confiscated property and assets. Based on democratic representation, even the watered down version yet to be defined of not conflicting with Islamic Law we're currently pitching, Shia would have the popular and electoral votes (and military) to effectively govern the Kurds. \n \n Disregarding US policy and other ME circumstances, I see the Kurds as being between a rock and a hard place. Turkey justifiably views Kurd autonomy as a danger, possibly influencing their substantial Kurd population into seeking independence, while the Shia will not let their (Kurd) oil rich territory remain outside the political and military sphere of influence/control, democracy or no democracy. \n \n Perhaps I'm too cynical, but I find it difficult to imagine that region as stable with hope and prosperity until it goes through the bloodbath most newly independent nations with ethnic diversity seem to require.",

Luckily, most aren't familiar with Cheney's Halliburton connection or the identity of our FCC Chairman, so nepotism is for the most part ignored. \n \n What I find difficult to ignore about Iraq, and the Kurd situation, is the lack of international support for our actions in that country. The Asian, European and S. Americans I know, while admittedly business people who tend to be better informed than the average citizen, are more aware of the causes of Islamic extremist activities against the US than is our general public and laugh at our rationalizations regarding Iraq, including the original WMD claims.

   "I see the Kurds as being between a rock and a hard place.\nI agree, they're in a very difficult spot, especially since the U.S. has historically been a fair weather friend to the Kurds, and there's no doubt that relations with Ankara, a NATO ally, are more important.\n \n Regarding the past decade of Kurdish autonomy, your concerns are well-founded. The threat of civil war is very real, though I'm not yet convinced it's inevitable. Perhaps it's the optimist in me that hopes the Iraqi leadership will take a lesson from post-Tito Yugoslavia. Still, I'm enough of a realist to see that Iraq possesses no natural unity, having been cobbled together by the Brits from three distinct Ottoman provinces.\n \n It may very well be that a state originally created for geostrategic reasons cannot be held together by representative institutions. If that indeed is to be Iraq's fate, then the situation will play out in either of two ways: a reversion to autocracy, or a fragmentation into its constituent parts. Either way, as you noted, a bloody conflict is likely to ensue.\n \n The disposition toward compromise will surely be tested following elections to the National Assembly. Right now the interim constitution that emerged from the Iraqi Governing Council in March includes language favorable to the Kurds and which the Shiites are unhappy with, as evidenced by Ayatollah Sistani's successful warning to the U.S. not to include any mention of the interim constitution in the UN Security Council resolution that passed unanimously in June. A permanent constitution will be drawn up by the National Assembly following next year's elections, and we'll see at that time if the Kurds insist on continued automony within a loose Iraqi federal framework, or if the Shiites insist on applying Sharia law to the relatively secular Kurds.\n \n At this point, it's still imaginable that the Iraqi people can arrive at an arrangement that satisfies not only the broad requirement for territorial integrity and stability, but also Kurdish demands for a degree of self-determination. You say the Shiites would have the military to \"effectively govern the Kurds,\" but you may be overestimating Shiite capabilities. The Kurdish peshmerga remain the largest and best trained militia in the country, and their ability and willingness to firecely defend Iraqi Kurdistan cannot be easily dismissed. Since the fall of Saddam's regime, the Kurds have further tightened their grip on northern Iraq.\n \n Regarding Turkish concerns, the Kurds are well aware that any push for independence will be countered by Turkey and perhaps Iran and Syria, too, as they all have Kurdish minorities. So I'm not sure Kurdish independence is really an issue, unless Arab Iraq descends into chaos. In any event, despite the poor history of Turkish-Kurdish relations, there are some positive trends, so the continuation of poor relations is not a given. Cooperation is already providing economic advantages to both, and perhaps more significant is Ankara's keen interest in membership talks for accession to the EU.\n \n \nPerhaps I'm too cynical, but I find it difficult to imagine that region as stable with hope and prosperity until it goes through the bloodbath most newly independent nations with ethnic diversity seem to require.\nWell, perhaps in general you are too cynical, but in the case of Iraq a measure of cynicism is apt. The complexities of the challenge are not easy to grasp all at once. Outside the effective administration of Iraqi Kurdistan, things haven't gone as well as expected. It's a shame the planning was so poor for the post-war period, but the clock can't be turned back. The biggest mistake was likely the large-scale purging of the Baathist bureaucracy. Especially the Iraqi military. If the Coalition Provisional Authority had been rapidly integrated into the Iraqi military structure, the operational and administrative efficiencies would likely have precluded much of the internal and external sabotage we're seeing.\n \n You're right about the ethnic and religious diversity being the paramount challenge. There's not yet a meaningful sense of Iraqi identity between the peoples of Iraq. A government that's more representative and more democratic will help to foster that identity. If the people who were persecuted for so long are given their rights, so that they owe what they have achieved as much to the new Iraqi state as to their own efforts, then it's still possible to imagine that a new sense of Iraqi identity can take hold and yield the prosperity that has been so elusive.",

I could expound on the not poor, but complete lack of planning by the provisional government; once again we've discovered throwing money at a problem doesn't offer solutions, but as you state, that's old news. My opinion is that if the Kurd situation isn't immediately resolved to the satisfaction of all involved parties, including adjoining nations, it will rapidly become a fast burning fuse leading to problems we're totally unprepared to resolve. And at this point in time incapable of resolving. People forget that Saddam used an iron fist to contain the Kurds and their oil, and it was for a valid reason. I'm not advocating his methods, only pointing out the probable results of concentrating on our very idealistic goals and shelving the deep-seated differences that will defy any possibility of Iraq ever reaching a harmonious form of government.",

While we've always been considered a racist nation by most of the world as we stress civil rights in our rhetoric, many also dismiss our government as corrupt and solely driven by special interests.\nHis definition also seems similar to your own expressed opinions, so I'm not sure why you shift the focus to foreign correspondents. Besides, the opinions expressed by foreigners are diverse, so if you get a similar opinion about America from all your correspondents, it may have more to do with the select group you correspond with.\n \n Of course we're a racist nation. We're also a lustful, gluttonous, greedy, envious, slothful, wrathful and prideful nation. Is there any sin we haven't committed?\n \n Actually, racism is probably one of our lesser problems, so it seems a misconception if foreigners contend that this particular national failing is so great that it serves to characterize our country and set us apart from other nations. It seems to me, that the people who call America a racist nation haven't looked very far. Racism also exists in the neighboring countries of Canada and Mexico. In fact, racism probably exists in every nation on earth. Name a country where it doesn't.\n \n More than a few foreigners imagine they know more about America than Americans themselves. Many of them, unsurprisingly, have never been to the states, so they often must rely on what they hear in the media, for better or worse. And lately much of it seems worse.\n \n Of course, life here isn't perfect from sea to shining sea, so there's plenty of room for legitimate criticism to be leveled at America. But too often people make charges that are wildly lacking in scope, like the 'racist nation' charge. If the rest of the world is our racism yardstick by which to measure our moral status, the charge doesn't hold much water.\n \n Some of the criticism of America is no doubt rooted as much in envy as in any legitimate grievance. That's always the fate of every nation in history that gained prominence over its contemporaries. The collapse of the Soviet Empire has also prompted an increase in criticism of America. Previously, some people felt a need to support the U.S. as a bastion against Communism, but that need apparently evaporated now that we're the only remaining superpower, not to mention the greatest threat to world stability.\n \n There's a whole host of reasons one could give for why people find fault with America. Consider our economic philosophy. We're capitalists, by golly, and as any good socialist will tell you, capitalism is a deeply flawed system that creates massive inequalities. Our strong focus on privatization and individualism is an affront to the reasonable sensibilities of many people.\n \n Also, as you alluded to above, our politicians and industrial leaders may cite principles like civil rights, free trade, and democracy that aren't always consistent with their actions. Such hypocrisy, of course, is uniquely confined to American leaders. Our domestic policies, too, are shameful. Even barbarous. Nothing else can explain our retention of the death penalty, or our liberal laws on gun ownership.\n \n The scope of our transgressions wouldn't be complete without noting our brutal cultural colonization of the planet. No wonder the foreign correspondents are upset. The prominence of the English language around the world is a real thumb in the eye. Then top it off with the export of our popular culture--music, films, books, advertising, TV, web sites, and so on. It seems we have an insatiable appetite for sex, violence, and simplistic notions of good and evil. Why can't culture be just another commodity to be freely traded? What's the harm in a little cultural imperialism? Oh yeah, from a foreign perspective the looming Americanization of the world is a fearful thing to behold. Be afraid, be very afraid.\n \n Well, at least we Americans aren't arrogant, even though we're the best and greatest country the world has ever known.",

   "I believe he is concerned with the Kurds, who might be peaceful now in the belief that they are going to get what they want from the formation of the Iraqi government, might not be so peaceful if things dont go their way.\nI understand that concern, but he referenced a 'situation' that needs immediate resolution. That's the part I'm not clear on. The threat of civil war between Kurds and the Arab majority doesn't appear imminent, and I see no reason to think the risk will much increase until after next year's elections when the National Assembly gets down to the business of writing a permanent constitution.\n \n \n \nCorrect me if I am wrong but the Kurdish areas have been mostly peaceful from the start, and there is not much in the way of Coalition forces in those areas currently. Also have the Kurdish groups disarmed?\nNo, they haven't disarmed. The Kurdish fighters, or peshmerga, constitute the largest private force in Iraq. There are actually two Kurdish militias that have jointly administered northern Iraq since the end of the first Gulf War. It's worth noting that they are bitter rivals, and in the 1990's they fought a civil war in Iraqi Kurdistan. The Clinton administration eventually brokered a reconciliation agreement, but deep divisions remain.\n \n The Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) is primarily a tribal and military group based near the border with Turkey. The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) is a social democratic party based in northeastearn Iraq. The two parties differ substantially in their political priorities. The PUK is aligned with U.S. interests and sees itself as having a substantial stake in an multi-ethnic Iraq. The KDP, however, is not particularly keen on federalism and leans toward an independent Kurdish state. This is due in part to the KDP's relative financial independence from the rest of Iraq, since they control the border crossing between Iraq and Turkey. The result is that Kurdistan itself is deeply divided, with half of it deeply interested in seeing the U.S. succeed, while the other won't be particularly sad to see us fail. \n \n No one is expecting the peshmerga to disarm at this point. As you may be aware, the interim constitution recognizes the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) as the official government of the three ethnically Kurdish provinces in northern Iraq. The KRG has presided over this area since 1992, but this official recognition is only for the interim period. That's why the real crunch will come after elections next year when the Kurds and Arabs sit down to resolve their differences in writing a permanent constitution. In the meantime, the peshmerga serve an important function as an internal security and police force in the KRG zone.\n \n Though the three Kurdish provinces are peaceful, if you view a political map of northern Iraq, you'll see that the cities of Mosul and Kirkuk are outside the KRG zone. One of the toughest issues yet to be resolved is determining the boundaries of the future Kurdish autonomy. Many Kurds want their region expanded to include the largely Kurdish areas around Mosul and Kirkuk, but that desire is complicated by significant Turkmen and Arab populations in both of these oil-rich cities.\n \n I don't know the extent of coalition forces in the north. There's likely not much security need in the KRG zone, where the most pressing concern is humanitarian assistance for people displaced by Saddam's Arabization policy. There is, however, a compelling need for U.S. forces in the multi-ethnic, oil-rich cities outside the KRG zone. Mosul is the 3rd largest city in the country. I have a cousin in the 101st Airborne who was deployed to Kuwait before the war started and ended up in the Mosul area for a year. Apparently, Saddam's troops in Mosul surrendered to U.S. forces without a fight, and we've had a significant presence there ever since.\n \n Same in Kirkuk, which is the hub of Iraq's oil industry and connected by pipelines to Mediterranean ports. The peshmerga swept into Kirkuk early in the war and publicly celebrated their takeover. Alarm bells went off in Turkey, which threatened to invade. The U.S. quickly moved forces into Kirkuk and persuaded the peshmerga to evacuate, thus ending the crisis, though some Kurds still have their eye on Kirkuk as the future political capital of a Kurdish state within federated Iraq. Meanwhile, the U.S. has budgeted over $100 million to renovate the Kirkuk army base.\n \n All of these multi-ethnic cities have the potential to erupt in broad sectarian violence, but so far the spasms of disturbance have been brief and limited in scope.",

   "I was interested in learning about the 'Kurdish situation' that you believed required 'immediate resolution.' Frankly, your reply sheds no light on what's so urgent. In fact, you only mention the Kurds in regard to their autonomy, but that's a back burner issue until after the elections. So you still leave me wondering what it is about the Kurds that needs immediate resolution. Until you can fill that void in your reply, I'll just assume you have nothing specific in mind.\n \n \n \nHolding elections and then hammering out a constitution without military control means the issue of Kurd autonomy, probably the most important factor in Iraq's future, is being side-stepped in favor of political rhetoric primarily driven by US administration claims of success in instilling democracy in Iraq.\nI chuckle at your noting the Bush administration's rhetoric, in view of your own post being rife with rhetoric.\n \n << we have a very tenuous Iraq presence\n There's genuine substance to our military muscle in Iraq. We pounded al-Sadr's militia into submission, and we'll do the same in the Sunni triangle, city by city, if need be. Our military is up to the task, despite being held back at times by political decisions.\n \n << supposed intimidation by air support \n 'Supposed'? On the contrary, the evidence is hardly imaginary. The intimidation is real and it works. Al-Sadr evacuated Najaf, and now his Shiite militia in Baghdad is turning in heavy weapons. And the Sunni insurgents are next, as seen in the assault two weeks ago that captured the rebel stronghold at Samarra, a key city in the Sunni belt north and west of Baghdad. \n \n << rebuilding of a federal Iraq military is seemingly more of an employment gesture\n More of a gesture than what? You don't actually say, but presumably you mean that it's more of an employment gesture than a security force. It's pure rhetoric to hint that we're building an army primarily to increase employment, as if the security advantage is merely secondary.\n \n << the proposed January elections more of a US political statement\n Again, more than what? You make another relative statement without providing the basis of comparison. You cynically imply the elections are more of a US political statement than an affirmation of the Iraqi desire for representative government.\n \n I could give further illustrations of the judicious spin that characterizes your writing, but I want to turn to the elections in which you \"see no future value.\" I think the value of the elections is clear. They establish the all-important legitimacy of a popular mandate for a new government to stabilize Iraq. The expectation is that approximately 12 million Iraqi voters will go to the polls to elect a 275-member constitutional assembly. That group will then appoint a new caretaker government, and debate and adopt a new constitution for Iraq, which must be approved in a nationwide referendum. Following approval, the first elections under that new constitution would be held two months later.\n \n Sure it's a tall order, but it's not impossible. You noted that UN representatives say a new census is impossible, but you neglected to note that a census is not really required. Indeed, just this week the officials of the UN electoral commission that would supervise the elections said that voter registration would not be a problem. The ration coupons used to provide households with food during the international sanctions will be used instead of the census. The UN officials stressed that the main challenge to the elections is the security situation.\n \n The basic infrastructure arrangements for the elections are already underway. Though only a small team of UN election experts is currently in Iraq, they have a support staff based in neighboring Jordan. In running most of the elections operation out of Jordan, Kofi Annan cited the model of Afghanistan, where the main UN effort was initially based in Pakistan.\n \n If the security situation in the Sunni triangle requires a brief postponement of the Jan 31 target date, then so be it. Your opinion that the elections hold no future value is irrelevant. What's important is that the Sunni, Kurd, and Shiite populations are saying that they want these elections to go forward. The international community can help make sure the process is free and fair.\n \n Turning again to the Kurdish situation, I want to address this assertion you made:\n \"Holding elections and then hammering out a constitution without military control means the issue of Kurd autonomy, probably the most important factor in Iraq's future, is being side-stepped...\" \n \n I think you have it backwards, or maybe upside down. The autonomy of Iraqi Kurdistan can't possibly be addressed apart from the elections and the writing of a new constitution, so how can the elections and constitution be deemed as \"side-stepping\" the issue. It should be evident that the elections are in fact a prerequisite to any further consideration of the issue.\n \n Kurdish autonomy is the status quo. It has existed for the past dozen years, and the current Iraqi constitution signed into law last March specifically recognizes the Kurdistan Regional Government as the official government of that region during the interim period. It's clear that the status of the Kurdish autonomy can only be legally changed after the election of the National Assembly.\n \n You advocate the view that the Kurd situation needs immediate resolution, and you frame that view with rhetoric about Iraqi elections having no value beyond U.S. political expediency. What is glaringly omitted from your commentary is any suggestion of what should be done. Feel free to state what course of action you think is appropriate regarding 1) the Kurd situation, 2) the elections, and 3) the military strategy for both.",

I've been involved in a geographical relocation with no Internet access. I have no solutions regardless of who becomes president. Our equity markets have played that same narrow band for a long time and I have no desire to become a day trader to make a living. \n \n Without military levels and control equaling that utilized by Saddam, Iraq will continue to experience internal violence as the various players jockey for positions of power. If democracy reigns, Shia will, with US support, seek to dominate the Kurd oil. I think all we're doing is prolonging the inevitable civil war or establishing a regime similar to Saddam's with the trappings of a democracy and using eventual ethnic weighted legislation instead of secret police as a control factor.",
