   "Some of the nation's most politically influential conservative Christians, alarmed by the prospect of a Republican presidential nominee who supports abortion rights, are considering backing a third-party candidate.\n \n More than 40 Christian conservatives attended a meeting Saturday in Salt Lake City to discuss the possibility, and planned more gatherings on how they should move forward, according to Richard A. Viguerie, the direct-mail expert and longtime conservative activist.\n \n Rudy Giuliani, who supports abortion rights and some gay rights, leads in national polls of the Republican presidential candidates. Campaigning in New Jersey on Monday, Giuliani brushed aside talk of an upstart effort by religious conservatives.",

The intelligent GOP supporter is rooting for a Clinton victory, because then in 2012, they'll be able to blame Iraq on her.\n\n A Clinton victory, or a Democratic one? They're going to try to shift the blame to whichever Democrat gets elected; it doesn't have to be Clinton, right?\n \n \n\n The GOP can't field anyone who deserves to be president. The Democrats ought to be worried about the future of their winning candidate, given the quagmire of Iraq. \n\n Ok, so this should all be in the politics forum, but...\n \n The trick, which Republicans are good at and Democrats haven't been, is in framing the debate. If you let your opponents define the issue then you've lost before you started. Right now Republicans are framing the debate in terms of \"freedom\" and \"fighting terrorism\" even though the Iraq war has nothing to do with either. But they're good at this sort of thing, so they're having some success in pulling it off. What the Democrats need to do is not even pretend the debate is about \"freedom\", don't even acknowledge that hogwash as something to discuss, don't validate the BS by even acknowledging it, much less trying to refute it. Any such effort will merely be spun as being opposition to freedom. They need to recast Iraq in terms of what is actually happening, and force the debate to be on their terms. If they can do that, then that plus the reality of the situation should be enough to prevent any sort of political catastrophy. But they have to take control of the debate, it's crucial. And I really don't know if they can do it; I certainly don't think Clinton can. She's far too worried about poll numbers to really take the initiative and force the discussion down the paths it needs to go.",
