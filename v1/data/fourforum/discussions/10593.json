   "So, I came across this recently:\n \n http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/1022757_cool_cash_card_confusion\n \n The upshot is that a whole bunch of people didn't get that -5 was higher than -6. They simply couldn't grasp the workings of negative numbers. As someone with an engineering education I find this dumbfounding, but I have to wonder how an English major might feel, or anyone who doesn't deal with numbers on a regular basis. People can only absorb so much. Should we stop pushing quite so much math and science at school aged kids and concentrate on the fundamentals (like -5 is higher than -6)? Should we leave \"higher level\" concepts to those who might pursue them profesionally? Or is this just an indication of a specific flaw in some educational system, and we should try to teach all our kids both how negative nubmers work and, for example, try to teach all of them the fundamentals of relativity?",

   "I think either people forget, they do not know how to read, or they simply aren't smart. In today's society people really don't care about something if it doesn't make them money. It's true. I think that's not good, but with the way life is wake up eat, go to work, come back go to sleep, repeat the next 5 days or 6...some people have their minds preoccupied with other things. In school though, I think we should teach them the basic stuff first, than move on to harder stuff. If a student can't grasp it, it would be better to give that student help rather than let him/her slack off and get the lowest passing grade possible. If we do that, they won't be successful in the future. I've seen this happen numerous times in the schools I attended because schools had to maintain their \"quota\"..and with the \"no child left behind\" thing it makes the matters even worse. Schools are learning institutions not money makers!",

It's true.\n\n I agree.\n \n There is that old joke about \"When will I use this math in real life?\"\n \n It's interesting how the punch-line of the joke revolves around the concept of \"never\".\n \n To me, the punch-line of the joke should revolve around \"Never. Burger King won't have any problems with you doing the french fries without knowing this.\" emoticon_xangel \n \n \n It amazes me how our society tries to talk about \"no child left behind\", as certain segments of society continue to try to insinuate their political and religious views into undermining scientific evaluations.\n When you've got a president that re-shapes scientific documents based on political concerns, is it any wonder that citizens are having difficulty evaluating whether -5 is higher than -6 when $$$ is on the line?",

   "How much math should we teach? I think that depends on the students. We should teach them as much as they can understand. While I see it quite simple to understand the relative size of negative numbers, it may be that my teachers explained it quite simply using a graduated line with a zero in the middle and negative numbers displayed to the left, positive to the right. I would think that the lotto designers might have made the relative values of -5 and -6 more easily understood by depicting a thermometer showing several numbers on both sides of zero degrees. Some people need no understanding of negative numbers, but if we don't teach some students such things, we'll end up dumbing down the whole world.",
