   "Despite what the press has reported, the fact is that Bush has signed a form (180) that forfeits his right to privacy with regard to his military records, thereby making ALL of them avaiable to the public. BUT, no surprise here, the \"man\" who is running on his military record refuses to sign the same form. Kerry accuses Bush of hiding information and stonewallinig, yet in fact it is KERRY who is doing the stalling. Hey, he's got a perfect and valiant military record, right? So why doesn't he sign the form and let us all sit in awe and read about his spotless and \"heroic\" record? AND, why does the press not report the facts (dumb question, I know, they are whacked out Liberals that will do anything to get Bush defeated). Okay Duo, I can't wait to hear your fair and balanced explanation-with you being above the fray that us mere mortals succumb to so easily, I'm sure you won't disappoint us.",
