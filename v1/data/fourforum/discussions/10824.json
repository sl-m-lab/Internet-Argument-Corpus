   "I'm betting that the young Marine will be protected by the Mexican government and will never stand trial for his deeds. The Mexican government will not send criminals back to the US to face a dealt penalty trial.\n \n http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/01/16/missing.marine/index.html\n JACKSONVILLE, North Carolina (CNN) -- The FBI suspects Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean, sought in the slaying of a pregnant fellow Marine, has fled to his native Mexico, an FBI spokeswoman said Wednesday.\n \"At this point in time we strongly suspect but have not confirmed that Laurean fled to Mexico,\" said Newsom Summerlin, FBI media representative in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n Laurean, 21, is a native of Guadalajara, Mexico, and a naturalized citizen who lived in the Las Vegas, Nevada, area before joining the Marines.\n The FBI said it is working with Mexican authorities to find and arrest Laurean if he is in Mexico.\n Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City said a Spanish-language version of the FBI's wanted poster on Laurean was being developed Wednesday and would be posted on the embassy Web site. Watch friend talk about suspect, Lauterbach >>\n The officials are hoping local media outlets will pick up the poster and publish it. Anyone in Mexico with information is asked to contact the legal attache at the embassy, officials said.",
