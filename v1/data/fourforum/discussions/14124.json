   "Stevens is retiring. I am not bothering to link a story about him retiring because I can recap the whole thing in a few lines:\n \n Stevens is retiring\n He is a strong liberal presence on the court\n He is an XXXXX\n His belief in the benevolence of government has made him a worthless justice\n \n The real conversation is \"Who is going to replace him\"\n \n Obama's high court choice: Consensus or clash? - USATODAY.com\n \n \nObama's Supreme Court choice: Go for consensus or risk a clash? \n \n WASHINGTON - President Obama faces a politically difficult choice about a new justice as the Supreme Court is at its own crossroads.\n \n Liberal Justice John Paul Stevens, who announced Friday that he will leave the court this summer, has been a shrewd strategist at crafting majorities. In recent years, he has worked with swing-vote Justice Anthony Kennedy to blunt the force of the dominant conservatives. Though Stevens' exit will not shift the ideological makeup of the court, it leaves a leadership vacuum on the left.\n \n It also offers Obama an important moment to shape his legacy with a lifetime appointment on the highest court.\n\n \n Personally I am betting he goes with a moderate. Obama has been pretty moderate as a president and I have trouble believing he is going to want to go to war with the republicans in congress over a nomination unless he has to. \n \n I do disagree with a lot of the analysis that says this will not change the balance of power in the court. Stevens was also senior justice, which means he spoke immediately after the chief justice (Roberts, a conservative). Now Alito (a fascist) will be the senior justice. Stevens was also good at coming up with absolutely nonsensical legal justifications to avoid actually handing out anything that may resemble justice. \n \n Stevens was not just a liberal on the court, in a lot of ways he was THE liberal on the court. \n \n Maybe we could get another Thomas......",
