   "These rulings were based on interpretation of the the 14th ammendment:\n \n The first clause reads:\n \n 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n \n The bolded phrase is the all-important one here. I think these words will be what leads to states recognizing gay marriages. \n \n I've heard \"Gays have equal protection. They have the same right to marry a person of the opposite sex that everyone else has.\"\n \n To me this is equal to \"Blacks have equal protection. They have the same right to go to a one-race school that everyone has.\"\n \n The latter thinking was overturned. It is a matter of time before we see the same of the former.\n \n \n .",

The decisions the judges made were going against what the president wants (thank God for checks and balances and of course States Rights) and hitting against one of his re-election points. Since a lot of Americans don't do their homework on politics and what's going on, adding a nasty little adjective like \"activist\" in front of the word judge, makes an impression on \"Mrs. and Mrs. Ignorant Regarding Government\" that these judges were doing something outside of their job responsibilities and by George W. Bush, he's gonna call them on it. Because gosh darn it, Bush is smart and strong and knows what he's doing...he has to know or he wouldn't be um, so confident now would he? Wouldn't he?\n \n By golly, I know those weapons of mass destruction are around here somewhere!",

   "Louisiana Judge Overturns Gay Marriage Ban\n by Adam Nossiter\n The Associated Press \n Posted: October 5, 2004 5:03 pm ET \n \n (Baton Rouge, Louisiana) A state judge Tuesday threw out a Louisiana constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, less than three weeks after it was overwhelmingly approved by the voters.\n \n District Judge William Morvant said the amendment was flawed as drawn up by the Legislature because it had more than one purpose: banning not only gay marriage but also civil unions.\n \n http://www.365gay.com/newscon04/10/100504laBan.htm",
