   "I'd like to have a debate about a hypothetical (or real?) person who got engaged on accident.\n \n prepare your case for or against the marriage as you see fit.\n \n anyway, here's the situation.\n \n ayoung man comes to thailand- he's about 19 years old, a nerd with many things (such as graphics, games, weapons, etc) and an internet junky. within the first week, his uncle- a native Thai person whom he's related to from another uncle marrying this uncle's sister- brings him to a week-long retreat about bible translation in a secluded village near the Myanmar border.\n \n during the course of the week, the young man interracts with (and in a small way) developes feelings for a thai girl who is also at the camp, who speaks only slightly more english than he speaks of thai, but who seems so joyful that he can't help wanting to speak to her- and she seems to think the same of him.\n \n on the last day of the camp, he writes a note to her that says \"you have a beautiful smile, and making you smile is my new hobby. you're my reason for learning thai\" and recieves a note from her (in thai) that, when translated, says \"you are very joyful and can make others laugh. try hard in your duty. I hope we can meet again.\"\n \n now: this would be no problem, except our hero, the young man, didn't know that he wasn't allowed to write that kind of note until he was officially engaged to the girl- as many elders in the local community seem to think of him as being now.\n \n the girl honestly seems interested in him (this is from the thai christian community- there's very little chance of her trying to marry him for his money or some such thing), but the waiting period to get married is long, during which both he and she must fast and pray- for two years.(edit: they don't fast and pray for two years, they remain apart for two years, during which they are required/expected to fast and pray)\n \n after marriage, she would like to go to laos as a bible translator but she is willing to follow her husband wherever he goes (and whoever he is): He would like to go into the military to pay for schooling as a linguist, but isn't 100% sure about bible translation as he is a *very* new christian and still clings to many of his athiest preconceptions.\n \n what should they do?",

   "Honestly, I would be pro these two getting married. This is because from how I read it they both seem to be very attracted to eachother. However, I would be against the idea of them seperating for 2 years and not seeing eachother during that time. That would be stupid. Why should situations like this be put on societies time table. I would say; invite her to America, get her a VISA (and a MasterCard:p) and marry her here. That is unless you yourself are not American, then that idea doesn't help much. (You never say where you (well the hero) are/is from. Other than that, I can't offer any help. Sorry.",
