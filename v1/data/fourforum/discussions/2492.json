   "I think many arguments on this page come down to definitions. The \"general theory of evolution\" is simply not recognised by evolution supporters. They have the highly specific scientific definition and don't use anything else. Montal ban was also calling Marxist science and Nazi science the same as all science which quickly got him nowhere. I admit that science does not guarantee you will act morally or cannot answer questions involving things that cannot be measured but the fact Von Braun was a nazi does not prove all science is wrong.

   "the term evolution itself has \"evolved\" so much that its hard for many people to pin an accurate definition to it.\n\n Really? I wasn't aware that the definition had changed. I do know that a definition was formulated as part of the modern synthesis back in the 1930s and 40s. That is the definition I learned some decades ago, it is the one I have always used, and it is the one that I still find in modern biology texts. It is also the one that all biologists that I know use, and of course the meaning definition of what evolutionary biologists mean when they talk about evolution should be determined by evolutionary biologists themselves. It seems kind of an empty exercise to invent a definition that isn't what evolutionary biologists mean and then argue against it in an effort to disprove evolution.\n \n Let me put it this way, do you think that it would be acceptable in a discussion of Christianity if I were allowed to invent my own definition of what a Christian means when he talks about salvation?\n \n So please, please tell us about some of these changing defintions. Like I said, I've been using the same one for over 40 years and wasn't aware that it had changed.\n \nplus there are so many other sciences that are lumped with evolution,\n\n Incorrectly by those who don't understand evolution. Talking about the evolutionist theories about the big bang is pretty mindless, since the big bang is cosmology. Whether or not there was or was not a big bang is irrelevant to evolutionary biology. Lumping other sciences under \"evolution\" is a method of creationists so that they can claim that they don't oppose \"science\" but only evolution. To be a creationist is to reject the last 400 years of science - cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, nuclear physics, geology, paleontology, tectonics, biogeography, genetics, population genetics, and so on. You get the idea.\n \nyet many debaters spend more posts arguing what is evolution and why youre wrong to call such-and-such evolution, and not enough time actually discussing how the facts, evidence and theories fit into the bigger picture\n\n Actually it is the creationists who don't know what they are talking about.

It seems like there's a battle going on over who is right about something that we just can't prove, yet.\n\n Then let me try to explain. Creationism in all forms is a religious belief. There are many kinds of creationists. For example, evolutionary biologist Dr. Kenneth Miller of Brown University is a creationist, although he isn't a young earth creationist. And Dr. Miller is quite respected among evolutionary biologist. He is the co-author of several high school and college level texts on biology, all of which address evolutionary theory.\n \n The contention isn't because scientists want to change your religion. Most scientists could care less. The problem is that creationists want to impose their religion on everyone by eliminating valid science from science classrooms, or by introducing religious dogma as valid science.\n \nThat goes for both sides.\n\n Actually, it doesn't.
