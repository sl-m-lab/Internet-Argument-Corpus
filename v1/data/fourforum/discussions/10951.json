   "There has been a lot of talk lately about what Obama would do if he doesn't get the Democratic nod for the presidential race. One rumor making the rounds is that Bloomberg has pledged $1 Billion for he and Obama to run as independents, with Bloomberg playing second fiddle as VP.\n \n Is there ANY chance of this happening? \n \n Has Obama's lead and momentum in the Dem Primary made his nomination by the Dems a foregone conclusion or can Hillary still manipulate her way to the nomination?\n \n Will an Obama/Bloomberg independent ticket ensure a McCain win in Nov.?\n \n If Obama wins the Dem nod will he choose Bloomberg for his VP?\n \n Below is a link to the story...\n http://www.liberallyconservative.com/?p=2281\n \n The word on the street is that the Obama campaign and New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg have already met and devised an incredible plan if Clinton wins the nominee. Mayor Bloomberg would give nearly $1 billion to Obama's campaign after which Obama would bolt from the Democratic Party and run as an Independent candidate with king-maker Bloomberg as his running mate.\n \n The Obama campaign realizes that Obama is too new at this game and doesn't have the political weight of the Clintons to bring in the true heavy-hitters of the party's hierarchy. So, according to sources it was Bloomberg himself who suggested this cunning strategy. It's mind boggling that the Clintons are willing to destroy the entire Democratic Party, and potentially in the process lose the White House and seats in Congress, for their own selfish thirst for power and glory.
