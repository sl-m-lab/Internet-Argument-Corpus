   "The Republican vice presidential candidate attracted criticism for accusing Mr Obama of \"palling around with terrorists\", citing his association with the sixties radical William Ayers.\n \n The attacks provoked a near lynch mob atmosphere at her rallies, with supporters yelling \"terrorist\" and \"kill him\" until the McCain campaign ordered her to tone down the rhetoric.\n \n But it has now emerged that her demagogic tone may have unintentionally encouraged white supremacists to go even further.\n \n The Secret Service warned the Obama family in mid October that they had seen a dramatic increase in the number of threats against the Democratic candidate, coinciding with Mrs Palin's attacks.\n \n Michelle Obama, the future First Lady, was so upset that she turned to her friend and campaign adviser Valerie Jarrett and said: \"Why would they try to make people hate us?\"\n \n The revelations, contained in a Newsweek history of the campaign, are likely to further damage Mrs Palin's credentials as a future presidential candidate. She is already a frontrunner, with Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, to take on Mr Obama in four years time.\n \n Details of the spike in threats to Mr Obama come as a report last week by security and intelligence analysts Stratfor, warned that he is a high risk target for racist gunmen. It concluded: \"Two plots to assassinate Obama were broken up during the campaign season, and several more remain under investigation. We would expect federal authorities to uncover many more plots to attack the president that have been hatched by white supremacist ideologues.\"\n \n Irate John McCain aides, who blame Mrs Palin for losing the election, claim Mrs Palin took it upon herself to question Mr Obama's patriotism, before the line of attack had been cleared by Mr McCain.\n \n That claim is part of a campaign of targeted leaks designed to torpedo her ambitions, with claims that she did not know that Africawas a continent rather than a country.\n \n The advisers have branded her a \"diva\" and a \"whack job\" and claimed that she did not know which other countries are in the North American Free Trade Area, (Canada and Mexico). They say she spent more than $150,000 on designer clothes, including $40,000 on her husband Todd and that she refused to prepare for the disastrous series of interviews with CBS's Katie Couric.Sarah Palin blamed by the US Secret Service for death threats against Barack Obama - Telegraph\n If you watch the McCain concession speech, McCain mentions Obama's name, and the crowd boos. McCain makes quieting motions to the crowd.\n If you watch the Obama speech, Obama mention McCain's name and the crowd cheers.\n \n Shows you a big difference between the McCain supporter crowd and Obama supporter crowd.\n Why is it that the McCain supporter crowd so willingly embraces negativity and attacks? emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Listen, skippy. The reason Republicans lost was because of the RINOs that are the GOP establishment. Palin has proven to be a threat to the limp-wristed, linguini-spined \"moderates\" (translated:Liberals) who spend their entire lives looking for that elusive \"middle\"\n\n \n If you look at what adding Palin to the ticket did for him, you'd have to conclude she assured his defeat. She represents all the things that have brought America to this pass.\n \n It is true that there was viciousness on both sides, but Palin was the only one who fed into it. McCain was careful to correct his followers when they got out of hand. Obama often spoke of his respect for McCain.\n \n And the night of the election, both men reached out to their opponents as well as to their followers. \n \n That's what America wants. Not more viciousness.\n \n That being said, blaming her for white supremists is wrong in the same sense she was wrong in suggesting that a church was set on fire to get to her.",
