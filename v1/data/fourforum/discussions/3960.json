   "Alright since there seems to be some biblical scholars on this board then I'm curious as to what you're thoughts are concerning Hebrews 10:26-31 - \"If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, but only a fearful expectation of judgement and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of god. Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.

It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.\"\n\n \n Hebrews 10:26 on warns against the sin of apostasy. Apostasy is an intentional falling away or defection. Apostates are those who move toward Christ, hear and understand the Gospel, and are on the verge of saving faith, but then rebel and turn away. Willful sinning in this passage carries the idea of consciously and deliberately rejecting Christ. The apostate has knowledge, but that's as far as it got (like Gnosticism in a way). Judas Iscariot is the perfect example - he had knowledge but he lacked true faith. The apostate is then beyond salvation because he has rejected the one true sacrifice for sins: the Lord Jesus Christ. To turn away from Him leaves you no true alternative. This passage is not speaking of a believer who falls away, but rather someone who may claim to be a believer, but truly is not. Anyone who apostatizes is proving they never had genuine faith to begin with (1 John 2:19).",

It is not written to believers. The idea is that if you never accept christ but rather keep on sinning then judgement will come. \n \n As I understand the christian theology, once a person accepts christ, they are eternally secure. Further, all men live under judgement, until they accept christ. Therefore, I am saying that this passage is not describing one who has already accepted christ. The reference to \"knowledge\" is a greek word that means \"to know about\" something. There is another word that could have been used that means \"to know experientially\". That word was not used.",
