I don't believe Kerry would have had the guts to do this nor would we have been better off today if it hadn't occurred. So I fully support this action. Secondly we go after Iraq. Although this was an unpopular action I think it was the right one.

I only wish Bush was able to go do the same in Iran and North Korea but there are obvious reasons why it has yet to happen. Oh and to what the rest of the world says about what we are doing, screw off. They all didn't care for us before 9/11 and they didn't care for us on 9/12 either. The big bad Soviet Union has collapsed so they no longer need to buddy up to us for any reason. They can now focus on being jealous of us and hating that we are everything that they are not.

I personally think the tax cuts are doing a pretty good job and Kerry doesn't seem to care much for those either.\n \n So all in all I am a Bush supporter again after waverying for a while.

   "outsourcing is a very minor problem, if it is a problem at all\n \n cons: lost jobs\n pros:\n 1. better service for the consumer\n 2. increasing global wealth that can help our exports\n 3. improves the quality of american companies \n \n over all, only about 1% of the jobs are outsourced\n and compared to the investment foreign companies are making in the US, from Honda, Mercedes, BMW, and so many others that i would be shocked if we lost more jobs than we gained. we need to maintain free trade\n \n \nOutsourcing May Create U.S. Jobs\n Higher Productivity Allows For Investment in Staffing, Expansion, a Study Finds\n By MICHAEL SCHROEDER \n Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\n March*30,*2004;*Page*A2 \n \n WASHINGTON -- U.S. companies sending computer-systems work abroad yielded higher productivity that actually boosted domestic employment by 90,000 across the economy last year, according to an industry-sponsored study.\n \n The analysis, one of the few that attaches detailed dollar values to offshore outsourcing's costs and benefits, was conducted for a coalition of business groups working to combat a growing backlash on Capitol Hill and in statehouses against the loss of U.S. jobs.\n \n Expected to be released today, the study's premise is that U.S. companies' use of foreign workers lowers costs, increases labor productivity and produces income that companies can use to expand both in the U.S. and abroad. It was commissioned by the Information Technology Association of America, an industry membership and lobbying group, which hired the economics consulting firm Global Insight Inc. of Lexington, Mass.\n \n There is a debate among economists about whether productivity increases from the outsourcing of high-paying U.S. work abroad has translated into meaningful economic improvement in the current recovery, in which job growth has been slow.\n \n Noting that business investment has been lackluster as well, Lee Price, research director at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank in Washington, said, \"I'm dubious that the boost in corporate profitability from outsourcing has contributed much to creating new jobs.\"\n \n But the study claims that twice the number of U.S. jobs are created than displaced, producing wage increases in various sectors. The report takes a rather narrow focus, tracking the outsourcing of computer-services jobs, but not other work increasingly being done abroad such as manufacturing, call centers or medical X-ray reading.\n \n Among the study's conclusions, spending for global outsourcing of computer software and services is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of almost 26%, increasing to $31 billion in 2008 -- or 6.2% of all information-technology spending by U.S. companies -- from about $10 billion in 2003.\n \n During the same period, total savings from lower wages, among other things, are estimated to grow to $20.9 billion from $6.7 billion. The savings are expected to translate into the creation of 317,000 U.S. jobs by 2008, including in construction, education, health care and financial services. Since the beginning of 2003, 104,000 jobs were displaced because of outsourcing, the study concludes.\n \n Demand for U.S. exports is expected to increase due to the relatively lower prices of U.S.-produced goods and services and higher incomes in foreign countries where U.S. work is done. Exports increased by $2.3 billion in 2003 because of the practice, and are expected to expand $9 billion by 2008, the study said.\n \n Outsourcing critic Ron Hira, assistant professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, N.Y., said he is skeptical of the broad results because the study focuses exclusively on the outsourcing of computer software and services.\n \n \"Nearly every economist has had a very poor track record over the past three years in predicting job growth, so we should take forecasts with a grain of salt,\" Mr. Hira said. \"That doesn't mean that these exercises should be dismissed.\"\n \n Nariman Behravesh, Global Insight's chief economist, said the study was done with an updated economic model that takes into account the current unusual recovery and industry surveys. The analysis looks at the upside, not just the negatives in the outsourcing trend, he said. \"We know we're stepping into a hornet's nest.\"\n \n Said Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America, \"Clearly, the political debate has been heated, but not informed. This careful analysis has yielded special data intended to help [the public] make more-informed judgments going forward.\"\n",

I think Bush is very strong on the fight against terrorism, working to deal with the illegal immigrant problems, and keeping taxes low but in turn he is weak on international relations and keeping government spending down. Kerry seems strong on international relations, pulling our troops out of Iraq, and is hoping to keep jobs in the US.

Kerry supports affirmative action, like most liberals do. But that isn't equality in action, that's reverse racism.

I'm an 18 year old white male in America. I'm not racist. But I do have a problem with the idea that a black or a mexican with lower SAT scores and a lower GPA has an advantage over me in getting into college.

I agree, that's not the place for it.

   "I agree, I don't like the fact that the conservative right wing, not only Bush, is using the Bible as the source of anti-homosexual motivation. It is prejudiced, yes.\n Which is why I feel he must go. His ideals go against everything the founding fathers, the constitution, and I myself stand for. He does not deserve to be a president. He represents everything that I despise. I may not like Kerry, but I think a few bad policies for the next few years is a fair enough trade off against the potential destruction of every ideal I believe in.\n \n \n \nI hate to say this (well, I don't really) but that's what you can expect from religions...ignorance and intolerance.\n I quite agree.\n \n \n \nI'm honestly not sure if I'm in favor of gay marriage or not, I see good points on both sides. What I'm leaning towards is no gay 'marriage,' but having civil unions with all of the legal benefits of marriage. I think that is about the only decent compromise we can have...it gives the homosexuals what they want, and it doesn't offend the right wing too much.\n Yeah I agree. This would be a sensible compromise. I do believe churches should have the right not to marry anyone if they don't want to, but there should be other avenues for support as well.\n \n \n \nRegardless, I'm opposed to what the judges have been doing, granting gay marriages in spite of the law. If you're going to do it, it has to be legal, don't break the law to suit your political bent.\nAgain, you are right. It has to be within the law. And the first step to allowing this is to get rid of Bush.",
