   "Switzerland votes to keep guns - Telegraph\n \n \nA referendum, launched by a coalition of non-governmental groups, religious authorities and centre-left parties, pushed to have the weapons stored in armouries instead.\n \n The initiative also aimed to abolish the practice of allowing those on military service to keep their government-issue assault rifles even after they leave the army.\n \n But the coalition failed to secure the votes of both a majority of the population and cantons.\n \n Final results showed that 20 out of 26 cantons were against while 56.3 per cent of the population rejected the initiative.\n \n For any initiative to pass, the twin support of a majority of citizens and of cantons is required. \n \n The practice of keeping arms at home was once a core part of the country's defence strategy, which was in part aimed at deterring an invasion with the threat that its citizens are combat-ready at any sign of trouble.\n \n According to official data, about two million firearms are in circulation in the Alpine country of about seven million inhabitants. But there are an estimated 240,000 more unregistered weapons.\n \n Switzerland's biggest political party - the far-right Swiss People's Party, said the rejection of the initiative is \"the Swiss people's affirmation of their proud shooting tradition.\"\n \n \"A disarmed army is a weakened army. The Swiss people have recognised this. With today's no on the weapons initiative, they have clearly rejected those army abolitionists,\" it added in a statement.\n \n Stop Suicide, which counted among groups that launched the initiative, said however that Switzerland \"missed an opportunity to take targeted measures to reduce the number of suicides.\"\n \n Rates of suicide using firearms in Switzerland are three times higher than in the rest of Europe, noted Anne-Marie Trabichet, from Stop Suicide.\n \n Amnesty International also issued a statement saying that it is \"regrettable that the majority of the Swiss population did not find that the place of a weapon is not at home.\"\n\n \n Good. More common sense in Europe. We've got the swiss voting to continue allowing people to own firearms, and the sportsmen in Ireland launching an assault against the government over tighter firearm restrictions and regulations. It seems more common sense is making an appearance in today's world. The people are finally getting tired of the governments of the world having carte blanche when it comes to such matters and are taking steps to remove some of that authority from the equation.",
