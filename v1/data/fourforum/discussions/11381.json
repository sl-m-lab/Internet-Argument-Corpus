I hope gun nuts realize who they are really helping and who they are really hurting!\n\n \n Your first mistake is believing anything CNN reports about the mechanical function of firearms or the status of American firearms law. CNN \"reporters\" are ignoramuses at best and propagandists at worst.\n \n Exactly how has the 2004 sunset of the 1994 Assault Weapon Ban increased the availability of \"fully automatic assault rifles?\"\n \n A person with a superficial knowledge of firearms should be asking, were the \"15 of its 79 homicides last year involv[ing] assault weapons\" involving weapons defined by the '94 AWB as an \"assault weapon\" or the technically correct definition that is alluded to in this report and thus covered under the National Firearms Act of 1934 which remains in effect, unaltered by the sunset of the '94 AWB?\n \n Let's review the CNN article, they begin by making the proper distinction and then purposefully blurring it:\n \"Cops are being trained on semiautomatic weapons, which fire a single shot at a time and are more accurate. Some semiautomatic weapons can fire with pinpoint accuracy from as far as 100 yards away.

Now, I'm hoping that 2007 was an aberration.\"\n \n http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-07-09-police-deaths_N.htm\n \n\n \n So, who's being deceptive and misleading, disguising propaganda as current \"news?\"\n \n Well of course it's CNN and Brady, what else is new?",

   "For Brady's information, as well as that of any other gun-fearing, freedom-hating anti-American people we've got here, the police have been issued M16, AR-15 and M4 rifles and carbines since 1997. You can blame the expiration of the so called \"ban\" on so called \"assault weapons\" all you want for the reason why police are being issued rifles to fight criminals, but that just goes to show your own ignorance.\n \n On February 28, 1997, two individuals by the names of Larry Phillips and Emil Matasareanu, were responsible for the most violent shootout in the history of the American police. Dressed head to toe in body armor that could deflect any and all handguns and shotgun rounds, and illegally imported machineguns straight from China, they did battle with the California police force for 44 minutes, firing at anything that moved with guns that've been banned from importation into this country since 1968, basically ruling the scene until SWAT finally showed up with the firepower necessary to penetrate their body armor that made them basically invulnerable and unstoppable.\n \n This was three years after the AWB was passed, this occurred DURING the ban! Because of the actions of these two it became apparent that police could no longer rely on pistols and shotguns to keep the peace, but needed to upgrade to modern rifles so they could more easily defeat armored bad guys!\n \n And get this, Phillips and Matasareanu were found in possession of similar weapons in 1993, along with bombs and other paraphernalia. They were arrested on illegal weapons charges, but instead of being given a prison sentence like they should've been, they were given three years of probation, and thus free to commit future crimes until they were finally killed!\n \n Edit:\n \n Actually I'm mistaken, it was in 1980 that police first began to get military rifles for regular patrol duties. It was on May 9th, 1980, what's become known as the Norco Shootout. So the police have been getting rifles for regular patrol duties for around three decades now. So shut your piehole about how the AWB was allowed to expire and now police need military weapons just to fight regular street thugs!",

I hope gun nuts realize who they are really helping and who they are really hurting!\n\n \n Come now, Brady. Do you really think that when you post these things no one will bother to check behind them to see if there is any truth to them?\n \n Let me start with a quote from someone you would consider a friend in the gun control issue: \n \n In March 2004, Kristen Rand, the legislative director of the Violence Policy Center, criticized the soon-to-expire ban by stating \"The 1994 law in theory banned AK-47s, MAC-10s, UZIs, AR-15s and other assault weapons. Yet the gun industry easily found ways around the law and most of these weapons are now sold in post-ban models virtually identical to the guns Congress sought to ban in 1994.\" http://www.vpc.org/press/0403awpass.htm \n \n The '94 AWB was uniformly condemned as worthless, and there is zero evidence that either the ban or its expiration had any effect on gun crime in America. \n \n If you would bother to check before you cut and paste the claims of others, Brady, you would know police officer homicides have remained stable or dropped, regardless of the weapons used, since the AWBAN expired. See:\n \n Law Enforcement Officers Feloniously Killed, by weapon type: http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/killed/2006/table27.html \n \n \"The number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty has declined since the early 1970's\" http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/homicide/leok.htm \n \n \"Causes of Law Enforcement Deaths (1998-2007)\"\n http://www.nleomf.com/TheMemorial/Facts/causes.htm \n \n Brady, your input on matters of law enforcement is of very limited value. You know nothing of law enforcement, or gun crime, or its causes, or its effects. You rely on others for information. This in itself would not be an issue but for your uniquely biased method of gathering your information. You search for things which you believe support your views and ignore things which do not. It's a lot like showing up at a crowded cocktail party and immediately standing up on your toes to look over the heads of all the guests for what few friends you think might be in attendance. And when you do find a friend, you blindly accept what they say without bothering to check behind them to see if they are truthful or not. This is what leads you to proclaim:\n \n \"Rise in Police Deaths because no Ban on Assault Weapons\"\n \n This statement is an absolute lie, Brady. \n \n But I'm not accusing you of deliberately lying, at least not yet. It appears you didn't even know it was a lie. \n \n ---\n \n \"Reason means truth and those who are not governed by it take the chance that someday the sunken fact will rip the bottom out of their boat.\" Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.\n \n \"Do not veil the truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth knowingly.\" The Koran, 2:42",

   "VERY TRUE, but to be fair, it allows one to fire as if it were fully auto, and it is completely legal. http://www.ak-47.net/products/hellfire.html Quote: The net effect of this is to increase the force that attempts to return your trigger to its forward position. Thus the Hellfire system allows you to fire your gun at \"full-auto\" rates, even though you are still pulling the trigger each time a round is discharged.\n \n\n \n The hellfire is a trigger return device...it pushes the trigger back forward. That is IT. Basically it makes slam firing easier. You can certainly peel off a lot of round with it, but when it comes to accuracy you may as well toss a box of rounds into a campfire. Personally if somebody was shooting at me, I would PREFER they have a hellfire. It pretty much assures that they cannot hit the broad side of a barn and they cook off all their ammo really quickly. \n \n The second link...you know what is funny about that? Using current definitions an interpretations of the law from the BATFE, the TWIST TIE would be the actual \"machine gun\". No Kidding! At one point a guy got the BATFE to declare that a SHOE LACE is a machine gun. Yes...they actually put that in writing.",

   "The real facts-\n The data obtained from the Department of Justice shows a steady decline of criminal firearm traces in which the 19 banned assault weapons were used. Assault weapons were nearly three times as likely to be recovered in a crime in 1995 than last year. \n \n Year Percentage\n 1995 3.57%\n 1996 2.53%\n 1997 2.02%\n 1998 1.80%\n 1999 1.91%\n 2000 1.59%\n 2001 1.30%\n 2002 1.22% \n (Source: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives)\n &#8220;We are definitely seeing a reduction of firepower in the hands of street criminals,&#8221; said Harold L. Hurtt, the police chief for Phoenix, Arizona and president of the Major Cities Chiefs of Police, one of several law enforcement organizations endorsing the Feinstein-Schumer bill. &#8220;We support renewing the ban because police should never be outgunned by criminals.&#8221;\n \n http://feinstein.senate.gov/03Releases/r-assaultwepsrate1.htm\n \n \n Do I hear some people saying oops?\n\n \n Your claim is still a lie, Brady.\n \n The first reaction I have is to note your new press release post steers well away from your original claim of a rise in police officer deaths&#8230; \n \n You don&#8217;t even know what a firearm trace request means, do you? \n \n Feinstein wants you to believe that every time a trace request is made it means another crime was committed by using an assault firearm. She makes use of the word &#8220;used&#8221; in her press release. This is not the case, however. Information on firearm traces can be found at sites like:\n \n http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/ All of these statistical compilations can be found at this cite. Find the one she relied upon and you win a prize&#8230;.\n \n Trace does not refer to guns &#8220;used&#8221; in crimes. It means guns recovered by police for any reason, whether used in a crime or not. Examples would include those recovered as being used in a shooting, or found lying around in a raided crack house and assumed stolen. Or found abandoned in a pond or ditch, or found carried by a felon who possessed it without firing it.\n \n This is why, when she gets down to actually citing her table for a &#8220;decrease&#8221; she does not say &#8220;used&#8221; but says instead:\n \n \"Assault weapons were nearly three times as likely to be recovered in a crime in 1995 than last year.\" \n \n Not used, but found and trace requested. Also, what she does not make plain for you to understand is that the figures she uses for guns traced are percentages of all guns traced that year. She hopes you will overlook this because the popularity of handguns has led to a higher percentage of handguns being traced than any other weapon type, with a corresponding decrease in the overall percentage of traced weapons being &#8220;assault firearms.&#8221;\n \n Now on to some unbiased research&#8230;.\n \n In 2001 researchers Jeffery A. Roth and Christopher S. Koper published a congressionally mandated review of the effects of the 1994AWB. It was published in the Journal of Quantitative Criminology, and you can purchase a copy for $35 from the following site link:\n \n http://www.springerlink.com/content/kv8610023463x574/ \n \n &#8220;In response to a Congressional mandate for an impact assessment of the law, this study utilized national and local data sources and a variety of analytical techniques to examine the ban's short-term impact on gun violence. The ban may have contributed to a reduction in gun homicides, but a statistical power analysis of our model indicated that any likely impact from the ban will be very difficult to detect statistically for several more years. We found no evidence of reductions in multiple-victim gun homicides or multiple-gunshot wound victimizations. The findings should be treated cautiously due to the methodological difficulties of making a short-term assessment of the ban and because the ban's long-term effects could differ from the short-term impacts revealed by this study.&#8221;\n \n Now before you claim these are gun nut picked researchers bear in mind that the when the 94AWB was passed Congress first required a 30 month review of its effectiveness. The Clinton Justice Department paid for this initial research through the National Institute of Justice. That agency awarded the grant to Jeffery A. Roth and Christopher S. Koper, who were at that time researchers with the Urban Institute. This initial study can be found here: \n \n http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/173405.pdf\n \n But having answered your poor attempt at statistical support the fundamental question remains: \n \n Why did you claim a rise in police deaths has occurred because of the lapse in the AWB? \n \n Your response post has nothing to do with my assertion your claim is a lie. Your bait and switch response is nothing more than an attempt to conceal your concession that your &#8220;rise in police deaths&#8221; claim is indeed fraudulent. \n \n To quote the first Roth/Koper study: \n \n \"such incidents are sufficiently rare that the available data do not permit a reliable assessment of whether this contributed to a general reduction in gun murders of police.\"\n \n That was 1995, and nothing shows it to be any different since 2004.\n \n Your claim is still a lie, Brady.\n \n Every time you post you further demonstrate that you know nothing of gun crime, its causes, or its effects&#8212;that you jump to conclusions not based upon experience but upon poor and very biased outcome-oriented research.\n \n I did say &#8220;Oops,&#8221; but that was in response to your getting something on your face in your haste to elbow your way through the crowd of unsupportive research in search of something you could (incorrectly) claim helped your cause. \n \n Here is where we are right now, Brady:\n \n 1. You professed belief in a claim that there is a \"rise in police deaths\" since the AWB expired.\n \n 2. I posted in response with unbiased evidence which I say proves you are wrong.\n \n 3. In response to this, you conduct more research to salvage your claim but your research method appears to be that of a blind man, in a dark room, trying to catch a black cat, that isn't there. You come up out of the basement instead with the Feinstein press release?\n \n Tell me again how this helps explain your \"rise in police deaths\" lie? \n \n Please tell me there is something more you can find at this &#8220;ban expires and more cops die&#8221; party of yours, or have all your friends deserted you now?",

So basically this guy is just like every other big city mayor and politician, they basically say \"We don't care what the Supreme Court says, we're gonna do what we want and nobody is ever going to stop us.\"\n \n Another point seems to be that Brady likes to use scare tactics, referring to commonly used firearms as \"assault weapons\" and \"machineguns\" and trying to get people to believe that unless they're banned, police will continue being killed off in large numbers\n \n Yet another point is that Brady and his fellow gun-fearing, freedom-hating, anti-American comrades consistently fail to understand, or choose to outright ignore and disregard, is that the people who're willing to go through the paperwork and the hassle to legally buy guns are NOT the ones responsible for killing police, nor does our lack of support for more anti-right laws make us somehow responsible for the death of innocents.\n \n We want to buy guns legally and it's our right to do so. That doesn't make us responsible for the death of anybody and we shouldn't be blamed for anything that isn't our fault.

   "Deadly designs. One thing leaps out from these pictures: the remarkable similarity of the first assault rifle to the assault rifles currently flooding America's streets. This family resemblance is not a coincidence. From the STG-44 \"storm gun\" to the Bushmaster XM-15, assault weapons have incorporated into their design specific features that enable shooters to spray (\"hose down\") a large number of bullets over a broad killing zone, without having to aim at each individual target. These features not only give assault weapons a distinctive appearance, they make it easy to simply point the gun while rapidly pulling the trigger&#8212;including firing from the hip, a procedure seldom used in hunting anything but human beings. \n\n http://www.vpc.org/studies/hosefour.htm\n \n so why would gun nuts need to spray fire a bunch of people from the hip if they are really law abiding?

What is the real intention of gun nuts?\n\n \n Well let me now address comments made by Shooterandproud and Ethmi about their suspicion that drove Brady off of this his thread for a while. I for one refused to comment immediately following what you said because I wanted to give Brady the benefit of the doubt. I don't visit here every day, and I certainly don't have the time to post here every day. I thought it could have been the same for him. I also reasoned that even if he had seen what I posted shortly after it appeared then he could have been simply withholding comment while he conducted more research for a second and more accurate swing at my accusation. \n \n Now we see he hopes it will simply go away if he ignores it. \n \n This is where we stand Brady, you and I:\n \n On July 15 you started this thread with the topic claim that the lapse of the 1994 AWB has led to a \"rise in police deaths.\" \n \n On July 18 I responded, called your claim a lie, offered evidence for the lie, and asked you to defend the thread topic you chose. \n \n You made the very next post in this thread, and you aimed it at me because of my accusation. But instead of addressing being caught in your lie you changed the subject in the hope it would mislead me away from your lie. \n \n You posted two more times after this in the thread, and each time you went off on another subject to pretend you didn't start this thread with a lie. \n \n On July 21 I responded again and reminded you of what you were consciously doing-changing the subject and refusing to accept responsibility for starting this thread with a lie. I asked you to address it again. \n \n More than a week has passed, Brady, and you have in that time posted four more times in your thread. Each time you have avoided the topic you chose to start this thread with which I say is a lie. \n \n Run, Forrest, Run.\n \n But look now, everyone. I refuse to accept responsibility for any absence by Brady, however long or short. All I did was say \"that's a lie Brady,\" knock on the bathroom door, and tell him it was time to go or get off the pot. I fail to see how it becomes my fault if he instead chose to crawl out the window, stay out in the yard for a while, only to start coming in through the back door pretending he didn't hear me.\n \n Who here believes his telling Dorothy to \"pay no attention to that man behind the curtain\" and pretending he didn't start this thread with a lie does not highlight his silent admission that knew it was a lie he cannot defend? \n \n And now he asks questions and demand answers of us in his thread? \n Brady, I have attempted to give everyone here the respect their individual actions and comments have earned. What makes you feel entitled to receive answers to your latest questions while you continue to run from mine? \n \n Quid pro quo, Dr. Brady. Why did you start this thread with a lie? I'll answer your latest questions, but only if you first promise to answer this one for me.",

   "http://www.vpc.org/studies/hosefour.htm\n \n so why would gun nuts need to spray fire a bunch of people from the hip if they are really law abiding? What is the real intention of gun nuts?\n\n \n Actually Mr. Brady lets get a couple of facts straight first the STR 44 is not by definition an assault weapon and is not available in the US. That gun is a machine gun there are very few of those in the US and the ones that are are registered with the BATFE. As far as the hellfire device and all similar devices are not reliable. Anyone using such a device has to practice with it to be able simulate FA fire and sustain it and is only possible under perfect conditions. If the shooter were stressed, rushed or distracted in anyway they wouldn't be able to do it. Pull the trigger a little too much, not enough or to much pressure or to little and the device will fail to function. \n \n Also Mr Brady there are millions of those devices out there if their owners were not law abiding you wouldn't be able to go down the street with out seeing someone useing one. Also if they were a problem they would be defined as a Machine gun by BATFE and banned with out any congressional approvel needed since it is a device and not a gun.",

I'll bet that you aren't content to own a cheese grater or a knife for your own personal self defense. In a confrontation with a criminal, you'd rather the more deadly weapon be in your own hands rather than in the criminal's hands. You'd rather be armed with a gun and the criminal be armed with cheese grater or a boxcutter than the other way around because you perceive a gun to be a more deadly weapon.

   "You need to stay on one side of the argument. You're the advocate of stopping power, not me. As a hijacker, gimme the full magazine over the box cutter and I'll quiet the passengers but quick. Who you kiddin'? You guys watch too many movies. One or two get shot and the rest freeze or flee.\n\n \n I think you are the one watching too many movies. I think would really matter if a hijacker had a gun or not. The fact remains, 3 of those planes crashed into buildings because the passengers did nothing to stop them, mainly because of the attitude \"everything will be alright as long as do what I am told.\" The other plane didn't crash because those people choose to do something about it and knew they were going to die. Regardless if the hijacker would have had a gun, that plane still would have crashed in that field that day. It's not about \"I'll get shot if I jump at him\", it's about survival instinct, even if just a little chance there was.",
