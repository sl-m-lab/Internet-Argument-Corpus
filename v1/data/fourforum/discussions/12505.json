   "I think you cannot be inhumane to yourself, because we are not creatures that relish in our own fearful pain. True, for some pain is pleasurable, but does that make it inhumane? Not so, because they do not view it as inhumane or \"bad\" because they view it as pleasure. Humans for the most part seek pleasure and not pain (that is something that would hurt us physically or mentally), but we can be inhumane to others because we are inflicting pain that they do not want upon them. I think, that being inhumane requires a sense of one doing it out of wanting to do it either to inflict pain or for pleasure. For someone who does it for neither pain or pleasure, it is not inhumane. I hope I am making myself clear.",

Of course you can be inhumane to yourself!\n \n Haven't you ever heard of self-flagellation?\n \n Or the ridiculous flagellants of extreme Catholicsim?\n \n Certain members of Opus Dei who wear the horrific cilice? The use of Discipline in Opus Dei ritual?\n \n Discipline: a cord-like whip which resembles macrame, used on the buttocks or back once a week. Opus Dei members must ask permission to use it more often, which many do. The story is often told in Opus Dei that the Founder was so zealous in using the discipline, he splattered the bathroom walls with streaks of blood.\n ODAN - Corporal Mortification\n \n Unless, of course, you do not view \"corporal mortification\" as torture, which I think makes you really weird.\n \n Yeah, you, Zardoz!\n \n You are really weird!",
