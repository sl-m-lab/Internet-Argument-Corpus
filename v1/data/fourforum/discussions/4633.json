But if you will be open to suggestion, you will also realize that as an adult, he has earned the right to be whatever party affiliation he wants, and does not have to apologize to kids for it. AS long as he does NOT preach to the class to sway them to his opinion/belief on religion/politics, then there is nothing wrong with his teaching methods. No one can be CORRECT on EVERY piece of the subject they teach. IF a student KNOWS what is correct, and is up to date on the subject , good for them, pay attention to the next chapter. If all the chapters are known by the student, they need to move on to a more advanced class, because they are now smarter than the teacher. jmo",

   "In the U.S., teachers have no religious role in school. Politics is a different matter. So, yes, teachers are expected to keep their mouths shut about their religious beliefs. They are agents of the government simply because of their position, and as such they may neither endorse nor support religion, whether that be a particular religion or religion in general.\n \n I'm sure you have noticed that almost without exception religious zealots claim to be conservatives and/or Republicans and decry the evils of liberalism/the Democratic party. Funny how religion has been confused with a single political stance and a single party. And yet, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton were both born again, Bible quoting Southern Baptists, while the conservatives/Republicans were manipulated by the new age, Armagedon prophesy, astrology (Ron met the Christian Coalition at the front door while Nancy was helping the astrologers sneek out the back), and marked indifference to church institutions, and the Bushes and the manipulation of old-line Episcopaleanism (and jumping to Methodist for Bush II) to serve political ends.\n \n Isn't that funny when you consider that the founding fathers were liberals and the Constitution and Bill of Rights were opposed by most of the conservative religious establishment. And it is still the religious right that is attempting to carve away at 1st Amendment rights.\n \n Isn't it funny how conservatives loudly decry \"activist judges\" until such time as they favor activism by judges, and then they do a quick and dirty passage of a one time law and encourage such judicial activism.",

   "Funny how religion has been confused with a single political stance.\n\n \n Neither confusion nor coincidence, IMHO. The 'political stance' that almost always goes with fundamentalist religion is extreme conservatism, characterised by fervent opposition to social change and support for social inequalities (e.g. of gender or sexual orientation). Literalist interpretations of scripture (take Leviticus 18:22 for starters) can be relied upon to provide rock-solid justification for an inequitable status quo.",

   "It's whoevers religion is more popular wins? That's how I see it.\n\n Well, just for the record, you see it wrong. Americans are guaranteed certain rights by the constitution. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prohibits government from endorsing or supporting religion, even the most popular religion. The Free Exercise Clause prevents the government from outlawing or seriously burdening a person's pursuit of whatever religion he chooses. Both clauses have been incorporated against the states under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. That means that the prohibitions of the Constitution apply to state governments and divisions thereof as well.\n \n Since teachers are agents of the state by virtue of their position, they are prohibited from endorsing or supporting religion in their class rooms. Teachers can and have lost their jobs over the issue. And the Supreme Courts have declared that prayer as part of official school events constitute an establishment of religion.\n \n And it doesn't matter whos religion is more popular, they don't have the right to use the government to impose it on others. If that were true then everyone would be forced to practice Roman Catholicism, since that is the most popular single religion in the U.S. The problem is, Catholics are a bit less anti-American the fundamentalist christians. Most Catholics actually support the 1st Amendment rights.",

   "Here is my experience. This year we are required to take a government class as our social studies.\n \n First semester I had a teacher who would discuss both sides of the issues and no one knew which side he was on. He was good at presenting them in an objective manner and finally someone asked him who he voted for in the election. He had voted for Kerry but he was what I would consider to be a perfect teacher.\n \n This semester we have a teacher who is an active Democrat (she was actually Tipper Gore's personal assistant when Clinton was president). She allows views from both sides to be stated in class and will throw in her 2 cents sometimes but allow students to refute her claims as well. She will objectively tell people the opposing side to their argument when they bring it up in class.\n \n I think that as long as they teach in an objective manner either approach is fine. As long as you don't portray the other side as ignorant or anything like that and you do present both sides.",
