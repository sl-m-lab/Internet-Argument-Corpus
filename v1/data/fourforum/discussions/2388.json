The problem is, when your strategies aren't working, or flawed from the beginning, you have to have enough guts to admit you're wrong and change them if it's for the good of the country.

   "I think active is a relative term in that there are now about 10,000 non-Afghanistan troops in that country. Certainly not enough to protect even Kabul, much less mount an effective operation on sealing the Afghanistan/Pakistan border. \n \n We're currently having problems keeping enough troops in Iraq to maintain a bare semblance of security there, even with the use of our National Guard and regular military reserves. And there certainly hasn't been a rush of so-called coalition members to fill the ranks. \n \n As to fighting terrorism 'in the shadows', even career civil servant Tenant estimated it would take our intelligence services a minimum of five years to effectively even start to infiltrate Bin Laden's organization, much less the myriad of semi-associated extremist groups. The examination of any cell-structured secret organization, especially one based on a belief system war, defies identification of more than a couple of percent of overall membership and then the other cells close around that point, rendering further interrogation or infiltration fruitless. The highly touted money laundering section of the Patriot Act is being used to prosecute dopers, common criminals and bent politicians, as it's useless in tracking funds primarily moved in the traditional Middle East manner of personal exchanges based on unbroken integrity stretching back hundreds of years. We certainly monitor their (terrorist) communications, unbreakable scrambled code satellite telephones, and change security color alerts costing us billions of dollars each time 'chatter' increases. \n \n All in all, yes, I'd say the bulk of our resources are concentrated on the Iraq theatre, with the war on terror, 9/11 in particular, back-burnered. There's no good publicity in pursuing failure.",

And not every one believe that there was WMDs they just thought there was assume the unassumed. That is the way this country is running like lately. So what you are telling me is that if you read in a book to jump off a bridge you would do it. It was wrong to go Iraq because Bush's dad did not finish the job when he was president. You see Ghost if I thought the war was justifiable I would have supported the war. You see Ghost there are other factors involved that we have over looked here and because Bush has a personal problem with Sadadam does not mean we should be paying for this war and I am not talking money here I'm talking about loved ones that got caught up in this mess and died.",
