   "Alright, here we go.\n \n Alito writes the majority opinion, joined by Roberts, Scalia, and Kennedy (who was long seen as the \"swing\" vote on this case). We get incorporation through the Due Process clause. Thomas concurs in incorporation (making it 5-4), but argues that incorporation should be through the P&I clause. Stevens dissents. Breyer dissents, and is joined in his dissent by Ginsburg and Sotomayor. \n \n So yes, Sigma. Thomas did declare incorporation should be through the P&I clause-and he is the only one to rule that way. In that sense you are also right when you say the decision is limited. In particular see what I post below on the majority's opinion of the impact of incorporation.\n \n Steeeeve, please give me your thoughts on Scalia's concurring opinion. As I read it I had a mental image of you nodding in agreement to much of what he says. \n \n Let me first deal with the majority opinion. Here are some quotes from the majority....\n \n The majority rejects incorporation through the P&I clause, and they make it clear they are using due process incorporation:\n \n \"For many decades, the question of the rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment against state infringement has been analyzed under the Due Process Clause of that Amendment and not under the Privileges or Immunities Clause. We therefore decline to disturb the Slaughter-House holding.\"\n \n The majority says incorporation under due process requires a declaration that the right is a fundamental right:\n \n \"The Court made it clear that the governing standard is not whether any \"civilized system [can] be imagined that would not accord the particular protection.\" Duncan, 391 U. S., at 149, n. 14. Instead, the Court inquired whether a particular Bill of Rights guarantee is fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty and system of justice. Id., at 149, and n. 14; see also id., at 148 (referring to those \"fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions\" (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted)).\"\n \n The majority says that if incorporation happens then it is the entire right, and not just portions of it, that applies to the states:\n \n \"Finally, the Court abandoned \"the notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a watered down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights,\" stating that it would be \"incongruous\" to apply different standards \"depending on whether the claim was asserted in a state or federal court.\" Malloy, 378 U. S., at 10-11 (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, the Court decisively held that incorporated Bill of Rights protections \"are all to be enforced against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment according to the same standards that protect those personal rights against federal encroachment.\"\"\n \n Having laid out the issue, the majority first takes up whether the RKBA is a fundamental right (about p19 of the opinion):\n \n \"With this framework in mind, we now turn directly to the question whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is incorporated in the concept of due process. In answering that question, as just explained, we must decide whether the right to keep and bear arms is fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty, Duncan, 391 U. S., at 149, or as we have said in a related context, whether this right is \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition,\" Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).\"\n \n \"Our decision in Heller points unmistakably to the answer. Self-defense is a basic right, recognized by many legal systems from ancient times to the present day,15 and in Heller, we held that individual self-defense is \"the central component\" of the Second Amendment right.\"\n \n \"Heller makes it clear that this right is \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.\"\n \n \"In sum, it is clear that the Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty.\"\n \n So the 2nd. Amendment RKBA is now officially recognized as a \"fundamental\" right. \n \n The majority also took on the argument of Chicago that incorporation should not happen because the 14th. Amendment was only an anti-discrimination measure:\n \n \"municipal respondents can hardly mean that \u00a71 does no more than prohibit discrimination. If that were so, then the First Amendment, as applied to the States, would not prohibit nondiscriminatory abridgments of the rights to freedom of speech or freedom of religion; the Fourth Amendment, as applied to the States, would not prohibit all unreasonable searches and seizures but only discriminatory searches and seizures-and so on. We assume that this is not municipal respondents' view, so what they must mean is that the Second Amendment should be singled out for special-and specially unfavorable-treatment. We reject that suggestion.\"\n \n The majority also rejects the fall back plea of Chicago to treat the 2nd. Amendment incorporation differently from incorporation of other rights:\n \n \"Municipal respondents' remaining arguments are at war with our central holding in Heller: that the Second Amendment protects a personal right to keep and bear arms for lawful purposes, most notably for self-defense within the home. Municipal respondents, in effect, ask us to treat the right recognized in Heller as a second-class right, subject to an entirely different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights guarantees that we have held to be incorporated into the Due Process Clause.\"\n \n The Court acknowledges that incorporation will place some limits on the ability of state and local governments to enact gun restrictions. But pay close attention to how the majority says this impact will be limited:\n \n \"Under our precedents, if a Bill of Rights guarantee is fundamental from an American perspective, then, unless stare decisis counsels otherwise,30 that guarantee is fully binding on the States and thus limits (but by no means eliminates) their ability to devise solutions to social problems that suit local needs and values.\"\n \n \"It is important to keep in mind that Heller, while striking down a law that prohibited the possession of handguns in the home, recognized that the right to keep and bear arms is not \"a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\" 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 54). We made it clear in Heller that our holding did not cast doubt on such longstanding regulatory measures as \"prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,\" \"laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\" Id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 54-55). We repeat those assurances here. Despite municipal respondents' doomsday proclamations, incorporation does not imperil every law regulating firearms.\"\n \n \"Third, JUSTICE BREYER is correct that incorporation of the Second Amendment right will to some extent limit the legislative freedom of the States, but this is always true when a Bill of Rights provision is incorporated. Incorporation always restricts experimentation and local variations, but that has not stopped the Court from incorporating virtually every other provision of the Bill of Rights. \"[T]he enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table.\" Heller, 554 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 64). This conclusion is no more remarkable with respect to the Second Amendment than it is with respect to all the other limitations on state power found in the Constitution.\"\n \n And, a second rejection of Justice Breyer's \"interest-balancing\" test:\n \n \"Municipal respondents assert that, although most state constitutions protect firearms rights, state courts have held that these rights are subject to \"interest-balancing\" and have sustained a variety of restrictions. Brief for Municipal Respondents 23-31. In Heller, however, we expressly rejected the argument that the scope of the Second Amendment right should be determined by judicial interest balancing, 554 U. S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 62-63), and this Court decades ago abandoned \"the notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights,\" Malloy, supra, at 10-11 (internal quotation marks omitted).\"\n \n Quick opinion from Bryan now.\n \n This case essentially cuts and pastes Heller to the state and local governments, and it had to declare the right to be \"fundamental\" to get there. The \"strict scrutiny\" test is not discussed by the majority, but the determination of fundamental right status assures me that this will be the future test when laws are challenged as infringing within the protected scope of the right. This decision elevates the RKBA up to, but no more than, the level of other fundamental rights in the BoR-like free speech. Of course, there is considerable debate about whether it is the role of judges to take an Orwellian \"all rights are equal, but some rights are more equal than others\" approach. But, there is no doubt now that SCOTUS has declared the RKBA to be in the privileged club of most favored \"fundamental\" rights. \n \n If you are a fan of gun rights, then this is a very good decision. If you are a fan of gun control, then while it's a bad day it is not the end of the world.",

He seems pretty set against incorporation.\n \n [T]he right to possess a firearm of one&#8217;s choosingis different in kind from the liberty interests we have recognized under the Due Process Clause. Despite the plethora of substantive due process cases that have been decided in the post-Lochner century, I have found none that holds, states, or even suggests that the term &#8220;liberty&#8221; encompasses either the common-law right of self-defense or a right to keep and bear arms\n \n and\n \n In short, while the utility of firearms, and handguns in particular, to the defense of hearth and home is certainly relevant to an assessment of petitioners&#8217; asserted right, there is no freestanding self-defense claim in this case. The question we must decide is whether the interest in keeping in the home a firearm of one&#8217;s choosing&#8212;a handgun, for petitioners&#8212;is one that is &#8220;comprised within theterm liberty&#8221; in the Fourteenth Amendment\n \n The practical impact of various gun-control measures may be highly controversial, but this basic insight should not be. The idea that deadly weapons pose a distinctive threat to the social order&#8212;and that reasonable restrictions on their usage therefore impose an acceptable burden on one&#8217;s personal liberty&#8212;is as old as the Republic. As THE CHIEF JUSTICE observed just the other day, it is a foundational premise of modern government that the State holds a monopoly on legitimate violence",

   "Steeeeve, please give me your thoughts on Scalia's concurring opinion. As I read it I had a mental image of you nodding in agreement to much of what he says. \n\n \n I think the Opinion was ok at explaining why we should incorporate the 2nd amendment. What I can't for the life me understand is why the argument even exists if you accept incorporation. If one of the goals of the 14th amendment was to incorporate the first 8 amendments then why would one of them not be incorporated? It seems to be that it is all or nothing. Seems that the dissenters and others wanted to say incorporation really has to do with substantive due process which is almost circular logic given the history of substantive due process (which I won't get in to). In any event, Thomas made the much better argument out of all the opinions given. \n \n The dissents were absolutely awful. I figure they could come up with something better than that...\n I can find nothing in the Second Amendment's text, history, or underlying rationale that could warrant characterizing it as \"fundamental\" insofar as it seeks to protect the keeping and bearing of arms for private self-defense purposes. Nor can I find any justification for interpreting the Constitution as transferring ultimate regulatory authority over the private uses of firearms from democratically elected legislatures to courts or from the States to the Federal Government. I therefore conclude that the Fourteenth Amendment does not \"incorporate\"the Second Amendment's right \"to keep and bear Arms.\" And I consequently dissent.\nReally? You can't find any history to show a citizen owning a weapon is a right? Like I said earlier, if incorporation was supposed to grant the first eight amendments protection against the states than it is all or nothing. Your argument can't be \"well, this one doesn't seem to have much history behind it\" despite the fact that the federal government has been restricted since the beginning of the amendment. Basically the dissent rests its hat on the idea that it is harmful. For shame, even I could come up with a better argument.\n \n Bryan, you asked about Scalia's opinion. Here is the summary: Scalia felt the need to school Stevens one last time. I've read some beatings by Scalia before but he really lays Stevens out here. JUSTICE STEVENS' approach, on the other hand, deprives the people of that power, since whatever the Constitution and laws may say, the list of protected rights will be whatever courts wish it to be. After all, he notes, the people have been wrong before, post, at 55, and courts may conclude they are wrong in the future. JUSTICE STEVENS abhors a system in which \"majorities or powerful interest groups always get their way,\" post, at 56, but replaces it with a system in which unelected and life tenured judges always get their way. That such usurpation is effected unabashedly, see post, at 53-with \"the judge's cards . . . laid on the table,\" ibid.-makes it even worse. In a vibrant democracy, usurpation should have to be accomplished in the dark. It is JUSTICE STEVENS' approach, not the Court's, that puts democracy in peril.\nOuch, back off...the guy is leaving! I grant that Steven's argument was even worse than Breyer's but good grief. \n \n That's the summary...don't bother reading it, you will feel bad for Stevens as I do.",

   "I agree Steeeeve. Thomas has the better opinion. The whole theory of selective incorporation has meant that the judges tell us they are the only ones who can decide if a right is really worth incorporating. But, as you note, we don't have a say in the matter, and we are forced to take the good with the bad-and in this case the outcome is good.\n \n I have long said SCOTUS needs to declare the RKBA to be a fundamental right, and that the right should be incorporated. I said this because selective incorporation, good or bad, is what we are stuck with, and I felt it to be the best scenario given SCOTUS case history with other rights. I think this case is (absent it being 9-0) the best outcome we could have reasonably hoped for (we being those who defend that RKBA). I also think \"strict scrutiny\" is now the test for infringement.\n \n I need to study the dissents a little more before I comment on them.\n \n I read Scalia's concurrence. Interestingly, he seems quite content to leave Alito's arguments without much supplement-which is an acknowledgement that he feels nothing more needed to be said in favor of the ruling.

Openly mocking the position of a fellow justice is not unheard of (witness the battles Scalia and Brennen used to have). But this was a complete judicial beat down of Stevens' position-and an opportunity to trash the \"living constitution\" theory again. Do you see how they divided up the counter arguments to the dissent? Alito in the plurality primarily taking on Breyer, and Scalia saying \"tag me in\" when it came time to confront Stevens. Very interesting, and it might suggest a personal issue between them....\n \n I'm generally a fan of Scalia (although he bit me in the tail last year with Melendez-Diaz).

That is NOW A FINDING OF FACT! Period! You lose on that count as well! \n \n \nBlackstone&#8217;s assessment was shared by the American colonists. As we noted in Heller, King George III&#8217;s attempt to disarm the colonists in the 1760&#8217;s and 1770&#8217;s &#8220;provoked polemical reactions by Americans invoking their rights as Englishmen to keep arms.&#8221;\n \n St. George Tucker, for example, described the right to keep and bear arms as &#8220;the true palladium of liberty&#8221; and explained that prohibitions on the right would place liberty &#8220;on the brink of destruction.&#8221;\n \n J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a71890, p. 746 (1833) (&#8220;The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered,as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them&#8221;).\n\n Fed 28 stands as a correct interpretation of our 2nd Amendment Right!   FEDERALIST No. 28 HAMILTON \n If the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that  original right of self-defense  which is paramount to all positive forms of government, and which against the usurpations of the national rulers, may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state. In a single state, if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers, the different parcels, subdivisions, or districts of which it consists, having no distinct government in each, can take no regular measures for defense.  The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms, without concert, without system, without resource; except in their courage and despair.  The usurpers, clothed with the forms of legal authority, can too often crush the opposition in embryo.\n \n The obstacles to usurpation and the facilities of resistance increase with the increased extent of the state, provided the citizens understand their rights and are disposed to defend them. \n\n No longer can you say that we are radical and government haters, because we quote this! The FACTS are now laid before you on the table! These FACTS are just history, and we are quoting American History!

   "Uh Bryan? Will that fly?\n \n Well, everyone expects Chicago to throw a temper tantrum! emoticon_smile But one good thing happened today. 6 more states now have a 2nd Amendment! emoticon_smile\n\n \n No one really knows yet. \n \n The first issue will be whether or not the proposed law encroaches upon the scope of liberty the right protects. We all know the 2nd. Amendment is written in absolute \"shall not be infringed\" terms, but SCOTUS has never held a right to absolute in scope-and I don't think it would start doing so now. An example of this non-absolute concept of SCOTUS is the 1st Amendment, which states the freedoms of speech and press in similar absolute terms. SCOTUS has held that not all things that could be considered \"speech\" or \"press\" are protected. See, for example, United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. ___ 08769, 8 (2010):\n \n When we have identified categories of speech as fully outside the protection of the First Amendment, it has not been on the basis of a simple cost-benefit analysis. In Ferber, for example, we classified child pornography as such a category.\n \n So that is the first issue: Does the law infringe upon the protected scope of the right. SCOTUS has not defined the outer limits of what the RKBA protects yet, but having handguns for self-defense is clearly protected. So assume a law is accused of \"infringing\" upon that right. Since this right is now considered a \"fundamental\" right the test for challenges to these laws is almost certain to be strict scrutiny. \n \n The first part of this test is the \"compelling\" state interest in the regulation. It's not \"we would like this law\" or \"we prefer this law\" or even \"we think the law is necessary or advisable.\" The state must show that it has a legitimate interest that is so \"compelling\" it \"compels\" the passage of the infringing law. The best analogy is to argue that the amount of infringement of the right, when compared to ignoring the legitimate compelling interest behind the law, is the lesser of two evils. Here is an example of something SCOTUS has decided is a \"compelling\" state interest:\n \n [I]This Term, in Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103 (1990), we upheld a state statute that proscribed the possession and viewing of child pornography, reaffirming that \"t is evident beyond the need for elaboration that a State's interest in \"safeguarding the physical and [Page 853] psychological wellbeing of a minor\" is \"compelling.\"'\" Maryland v. Craig, 497 U.S. 836, 852-853 (1990)\n \n So, for any of Mayor Daley's proposals, ask yourself can the Mayor establish a \"compelling\" state interest for the law.\n \n If the government can show a \"compelling state interest, then it must next show the law is \"narrowly tailored\" to achieve that interest. In other words, the law: \n \n must be \"precis[e]\" and narrowly \"tailored\" to achieve the \"pin-pointed objective\" of the \"needs of the case\" Tory v. Cochran, 544 U.S. 734, 738 (2005)\n \n See also this language for guidance:\n \n The Government may serve this legitimate interest, but to withstand constitutional scrutiny, \"it must do so by narrowly drawn regulations designed to serve those interests without unnecessarily interfering with First Amendment freedoms. Hynes v. Mayor of Oradell, 425 U.S., at 620; First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 786 (1978).\" Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U.S. 620, 637 (1980). It is not enough to show that the Government's ends are compelling; the means must be carefully tailored to achieve those ends. Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989)\n \n So, the next question is can the Mayor demonstrate that his law is a pin point way to achieve the compelling state interest. \n \n Finally, the Government must show that the law in question is the \"least restrictive means\" of addressing the \"compelling\" interest. Or, to put it another way, a judge who does not like the law can think of no less restrictive law to substitute in its place that would effectively deal with the \"compelling\" state interest. \n \n So the test requires proof of a compelling interest for the law, that the law is targeted narrowly and specifically at addressing the compelling interest at stake, and that the law is also the least restrictive (of the right, that is) way to deal with the compelling interest. It's not something to be lightly dismissed. See, for example, this case:\n \n Requiring a State to demonstrate a compelling interest and show that it has adopted the least restrictive means of achieving that interest is the most demanding test known to constitutional law. City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 509 (1997)\n \n Now in theory, and mostly in practice, it is a stringent test. But Judges can and in my opinion do bring their own biases to the case. For example, a judge who personally favors abortion rights will look very differently at a state's claim to have a \"compelling\" state interest in regulating abortion than a judge who personally dislikes abortion. \n \n Also bear in mind strict scrutiny may not apply to all of the RKBA. SCOTUS has a long history of peeling off portions of \"fundamental\" rights and declaring those portions do not deserve strict scrutiny protection. An example would be free speech. Political speech (like \"vote for this guy\") gets strict scrutiny protection, but commercial speech (like \"my product is guaranteed to prevent cancer\") does not. So we have to wait on a case by case challenge basis to see how SCOTUS further defines the 2nd. Amendment liberty interest to see if strict scrutiny will apply in every instance. Finally, there are instances where SCOTUS has found the burden of the regulation is slight enough that it does not require a strict scrutiny analysis. \n \n So there are a lot of variables in play, and I cannot say for certain whether Mayor Daley's proposals would survive a challenge. I know he wants the citizens to have to jump through as many burdensome hoops as possible. \n The victory won yesterday is that the mayor can no longer deny the citizens a right to try.",

   "Let's be honest, it won't result in any more or less gun deaths and even if it resulted in more gun deaths it would be worth having the amendment. The 2nd amendment was only created to give citizens a last resort should the government fail us. It may seem like we don't need that now but one day it really might come in handy and people shouldn't forget that. \n \n I still think incorporation is a load of BS though...for any amendment. Damn you 14th amendment!\n\n \n I love the 14th amendment, though I think that selective incorporation is a tortured doctrine that has never made sense. I think Thomas' opinion is the most compelling in this case, and I wish the court majority had applied the privileges or immunities clause, as Thomas alone was willing to do. If we go back to the original debates on the 14th amendment, I think it's clear that the framers and the ratifiers intended the privileges or immunities clause to be the centerpiece of the amendment, the central means by white rights would be protected. I like the idea of sweeping away the ruling in the Slaughterhouse Cases and restoring the privileges or immunities clause to the position that I think both the framers and the ratifiers of the 14th amendment intended it to occupy. \n \n I think the 14th amendment changed the role of the federal government in protecting rights, and I think it thus fundamentally changed the constitution. Instead of a constitution that limited federal power in order to protect liberty, the 14th amendment created a constitution that expanded federal power to protect liberty from abrogation by the states. This is a bothersome thing to those who believe that expanding federal power is necessarily bad. But the Republicans of the 1860s disagreed with you. They saw the greatest threat to liberty not as the federal government, but as the state governments.",

This is a bothersome thing to those who believe that expanding federal power is necessarily bad. But the Republicans of the 1860s disagreed with you. They saw the greatest threat to liberty not as the federal government, but as the state governments.\n\n First, I would like to say, I totally agree with you! What gives the Supreme Court the Right to Kill P&I the way they did? Now the problem is Stare Decisis. The S.C. violated the Contract right there! Wich means that we still have more work to do!\n \n The 14th Amendment was a recognition of reality! The State Governments, and municipalities, drunk with power, were the ones who became the abusers! In order to avoid more inevitable wars, the option they selected to fix this problem was the 14th. However, part of the abuse comes from the S.C. itself. Then after the 14th, they compound the problem, I think it was a hessy fit, because they were ticked off by being overruled by the 14th. Amendment, by ignoring the Will of We the People and Congress's right to amend the Constitution they way they saw fit, adding P&I. \n \n Add P&I, and I think their solution was a sound one! \n \n For those who don't like the 14 Amendment, first do all of the hard work to fix the original problems. American Society had changed from property owners being the only people with Rights, to now to one where we all have these Inalienable Rights. (Who doesn't want that?) The States themselves became the abusers of our Inalienable Rights of Freemen, which set a dangerous president that would have led to wars within States. (See the arguments the Anti-gunners made, using these Raciest Rights denying practices.) The Supreme Court became culpable in abusing Inalienable Rights of Freemen, even after the 14th Amendment. \n \n Then, with this brilliant solution in hand, do all of the hard work of proposing it, passing it, and getting it ratified! Otherwise you really have no Constitutionally legal legitimate argument. Without the 14th, you would just put us right back where we were before. Without doing the above first, your arguments against the 14th won't win debates, nor will it stand up in court! \n \n Unless, of course, you liked the institution of Slavery, that is, with the slaves being all of us. \n \n Our Republic was heading for total Destruction! You can't tell people, through our Founding Documents, that they have Inalienable Rights, then given the example of our Founding Fathers, who started a Revolution when the British came to disarm them, not give them to them! \n   The Declaration of Independence \nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes;\n\n \n More war was imminent! We the People had not agreed to be Slaves of any State! A Federal guarantor was a Brilliant solution! I think it saved the Republic, and America became a great and powerful nation. Otherwise you would have had a bunch of small enclaves with differing degrees of freedom, and the reverse, states with differing degrees of power, all bickering among themselves, within the states. See California, D.C. and Chicago! emoticon_smile\n \n Now the problem is that we need to keep the Federal Government from encroaching! Sometimes the Supreme Court too. That has become the job of the 50 States acting in concert, with We the People pulling the levers at the voting booths! Instead of bickering among ourselves, we need to roll up our sleeves, and band together, finish the job of fixing our Republic.\n \n I think the 14th Amendment and States Rights are EXTREMELY Compatible, and can ensure even greater success, as it only fixes one thing. Our Rights are Inalienable, and NO Government has the Right to take them from us!\n \n That is my thought for today!",

   "My position is this. While I am not a fan of gun rights, the second amendment is there. I think the framers probably did intend the amendment to ensure that the federal government not deny individuals the right to bear arms. I think that if the Supreme Court is going to incorporate the Bill of Rights, they should certainly incorporate the second amendment, and now they have done so. I think the ruling in this case is the right one, though I think the Supreme Court majority should have taken Clarence Thomas' route and incorporated via the privileges or immunities clause, not the due process clause. \n \n I think the question of regulating gun possession will become paramount now. The Supreme Court has never held that rights are absolute; they must be balanced against state interests in protecting people. We will see how all of this gets worked out in the courts. \n \n I personally have no stake either way on the issue of gun rights. I don't care about this issue particularly. I do worry about people carrying guns around, and I certainly hope that gun owners will be careful, especially when the gun owners have children.

That alone is enough to shoot down your argument. And then there's the opinion of the Supreme Court judge, Clarence Thomas, who voted in favor of McDonald, who also happens to be black. See his writing on the subject.\n \n \nAfter all, the City of Chicago allows citizens to own rifles, so there never was a ban on guns in Chicago; there was a ban on a certain type of gun, which didn't even exist at the time the Constitution was written.\n\n \n Actually handguns predate the Constitution. You'd know that if you bothered to check the facts of history. If you don't believe that just look at the British heavy dragoon pistol, it was around as early as 1720.\n \n And then there's the determination of the judges in Heller, which was extended to the stated in McDonald; they outright rejected the argument that the definition of \"arms\" which are protected by the Second Amendment stops at 18th century technology. The flat out stated that such an argument was frivolous and had no credit.\n \n \nBut it is the handgun that makes so many white males feel impregnable, as if they were riding around with a turret gun in a Hummer.\n\n \n Speaking from experience, or just homophobic paranoia?\n \n \nIt's a vestige of the Confederacy; \"I'm a white man and that allows me to do whatever I want and get away with it, so don't mess with me.\"\n\n \n So besides being a homophobe you're also a racist.\n \n \nIt's not about the Constitution; it's about a hormonal psychology under siege.\n\n \n Wrong again Brady.

(It's the same 5-4 GOP block -- with some face changes -- that put Bush in the White House and bestowed Corporate Personhood in the Citizens United Case, in short a radical right activist majority of judges.)\n \n It's about white males in America feeling threatened by becoming a minority and the gun is their last psychological reassurance of entitlement power against an encroaching demographic change in our democracy. After all, the City of Chicago allows citizens to own rifles, so there never was a ban on guns in Chicago; there was a ban on a certain type of gun, which didn't even exist at the time the Constitution was written.\n \n But it is the handgun that makes so many white males feel impregnable, as if they were riding around with a turret gun in a Hummer.\n \n It's a vestige of the Confederacy; \"I'm a white man and that allows me to do whatever I want and get away with it, so don't mess with me.\"\n \n It's not about the Constitution; it's about a hormonal psychology under siege.\n \n Meanwhile, the presence of handguns in America causes more deaths than our wars -- and few politicians or corporate media will do anything but giving passing note to the carnage.\n \n Why? Because the white male is still too big of a voter bloc to psychologically \"mess with.\" Even Harry Reid, the Democratic Majority Leader in the Senate, sent out a news release applauding the Supreme Court for overturning the ban on handguns in Chicago and \"upholding the 2nd Amendment.\"\n \n As America becomes more diverse in race and religion, the white male psyche becomes more frantic in need of \"firearms reassurance.\"\n \n And the death toll mounts as a result.\n \n BuzzFlash doesn't think Jesus walks around shoulder holstered and locked and loaded. The Supreme Court has just changed one of our nation's mottos from \"In God We Trust\" to \"In Guns We Trust.\"\n \"In Guns We Trust\": New Supreme Court Motto for U.S. - Gun Guys\n\n \n You left wing bone, the leading cause of death in the latter century was DEMOCIDE provided to you kindly by governments disarming their people before slaughtering them!! You joining the \"gun grabber guys\" since they were a lot closer to you than to us. emoticon_xgood \n \n No job yet huh brady? emoticon_cry",
