She would love to live somewhere away from it all. She is bright and funny and full of life and while she has little direct experience with the opposite sex we have made sure she is aware of everything she needs to know to be a good wife and mother.\n The interesting part, to me, is that this IS Biblical tradition. Families selling young girls, for paternal profit and gain.\n And the age, although repulsive for modern society, is more indicative of Biblical traditional practices.",

   "Kristin has a wild streak. She likes parties and has spent more time with boys than we'd have liked her to. We had a family talk and decided that it was time she settled down with a man who could meet her needs and help her fulfill her dreams of being an actor or singer. She's a bit fiery but worth it.\n \n going price $50k\n\n \n WTH? I thought you had to put up a dowery for your girls...NOT sell them off.\n I certainly won't buy a used up 16 yo for 50k when I can get 10 better ones from China for the same price.\n /sarcasm.\n \n \n I do think there is something to be aid about arranged marriages but, that's only when the society also supports it.\n IMO, most parents don't possess the wisdom or intelligence to be able to help arrange a marriage anymore.",
