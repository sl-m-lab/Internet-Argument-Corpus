   "http://columbiacitypaper.com/2007/5/23/the-big-takeover\n \n \nChristian Exodus, as the name implies, is a national organization currently based in California that has plans to gather together thousands of conservative Christians from across the country and move them to South Carolina to sway the popular vote. And though the scenario above sounds like something ripped from the pages of a science fiction novel, the early stage of the Christian Exodus mass migration to South Carolina has already begun. \n \n The first phase of the group's action plan sets a goal of 100 new activists in their \"Phase One\" county by the 2008 primary election. They plan to work several local campaigns in 2008 and win a majority of that county council by 2009. In a recent newsletter, Christian Exodus claims to have 1,400 members with close to 200 activists already on the ground in South Carolina. By some reports, the group is focusing on six strategic counties: Anderson, Greenville, Spartanburg and Pickens counties in the Upstate; Lexington County in the Midlands; and Dorchester County in the Lowcountry. \n \n \"The time has come for Christian Constitutionalists to protect our liberties in a State like South Carolina by interposing the State's sovereign authority retained under the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution,\" the group states. \"If we really mean to return to the Christian principles of constitutional American government, we must start at the local level and accelerate the process through mass migration.\" \n \n * * *\n \n The issues at the forefront of the Christian Exodus movement center on the usual fundamentalist Christian fare though they are packaged in a John Birch Society-style secessionist package. The group would ban abortion, divorce, pornography and property taxes. They would institute prayer in school, ignore the science of evolution in the classroom and would ban homosexuality altogether. \n \n \"We're all sinners and all sinners would be welcome in South Carolina, however this doesn't lead to the conclusion that sin must be legal,\" Burnell told City Paper. \"So, the issue at hand is whether homosexual acts would be lawful in South Carolina, and I point out that they are already illegal in South Carolina.\" \n \n Burnell believes that the S.C. law against \"Buggery\" (SC ST SEC 16-15-120), which was overruled by the Lawrence v. Texas U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2003, should be upheld. \"Candidates elected by our efforts will continue to enforce Section 16-15-120 just as it had been for decades, and will disregard Lawrence v. Texas because it plainly violates the 10th Amendment,\" he said. \n \n Another of their concerns is that U.S. citizens are denied the right to bear arms \"sufficient for the restraint of tyranny.\" In this day of highly advanced, mechanized warfare City Paper asked Burnell what type of arms he would consider sufficient, should the U.S. government respond with force against a peaceful secession.\n \n \"'Sufficient to restrain tyranny' does not require cutting edge battlefield technology when an entire people is rising up in defense of itself. I think a consensus exists among American conservatives that fully automatic weapons are sufficient for a fairly unified people to defend themselves against despotism,\" Burnell said. \n \n In general, Christian Exodus claims to follow a Christian Paleoconservative party line. Paleoconservatives push for a literal \"original intent\" reading of the Constitution and are reticent to stray from that interpretation. The concept of minimal bureaucracy is a key element in their philosophy. Most believe that immigration serves to dilute American culture and they disagree with affirmative action and welfare. They believe that the country should stay out of the United Nations and withdraw from foreign policy and foreign wars. Some Paleoconservatives support animal welfare and environmental protection. \n \n Many Christian Exodus members have also aligned themselves with the ultra conservative Constitution Party, which, according to some polls, ranks third nationally among all U.S. political parties in registered voters. \n",
