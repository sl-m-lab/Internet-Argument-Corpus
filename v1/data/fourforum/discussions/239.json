   "Laplace181 s Speak about Fourier series:\n Fourier series underlying principal is the way to approach any graphic curve or Functions(ic is continueous) by small arc of cosine and sine functions\n It involved cosine functions and sine functions of different phrase angle and different frequencies and different mantitudes\n \n For my explanlation ,any part of a continuue curve can be mimic as close as possible by arcs with different slopes (+ve or -ve)and such a whole can be treat as accurate as whatever possible by many sine and cosine functions expreese as sum of terms.each terms has different phase angle ,slop, and frequency(eg Cos(2wt+45),6cos(3wt + 230).......................................\n \n Says in electronic ,one complicate electronic signals(graphic)is treated as contributed by harmonic (differnt frequency)of sine and cosine signals \n Ist harmonics is the primary frequency eg...56Cos(4t) or56cos(4t+phrase angle) Phrase angle could be any value between o and 360 or O and 2 prime\n \n 2nd Harmonic (double frequency)eg 34Cos(8t)...\n \n 3rd Harmonic Sin(16t)...so on*******************\n \n But as general for many function and electronic signals a series of ten of little more terms (harmonics) is a very accurate simulations of the true theoremical signal(graph)That is good fidility\n \n \n ********Laplace181 will overjoy is some one find this article of mine interesting***************",
