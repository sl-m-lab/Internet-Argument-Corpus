   "I don't know enough about 4 of the 6 to make a answer. \n\n \n You don't know enough? Really? I gave you a non-partisan link that clearly told you how they generally rule. \n \n http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/interp.html\n \n That tells you all you need to know about them. But you won't answer of course, and here's why; If you say you side with Bork/Thomas/Scalia, as I do, then you know I'll easily be able to show you how well they side with Owen. If you say you side with Blackmun/Brennan/Posner, then you know I'll easily be able to show how some of their rulings fly in the face of some of your previous posts here, the ones about how conservative and freedom loving you are. \n \n \nAs for you, stating the afraid issue is quite hypocritical as you have fled like a  coward from several high profile challenges. \n\n \n Please, name a high profile challenge I have fled from. One that \"TEXT of the constitution and INTENT of the framers\" didn't answer. \n \n \n \n \nAs you for, why are you afraid to deal with your own logic? You clearly stated that Owen's job was to interpret according to the consitutiion and therefore she was not a activist. Every judge does this so according to your logic, there is no such thing as a activist judge is Owen does not count. But then again, you're likely to stupid to understand that. \n\n \n You're getting incoherent. Some judges do their jobs better than others. Thurgood Marshall once said this; \"You do what you think is right and let the law catch up.\" I don't think you'll hear Bork/Thomas/Scalia/Owen say anything like that.\n \n \n \n \nCircular reasoning. You assume that they are originalist without proving such. \n\n \n THE NON-PARTISAN LINK I PUT UP PROVED IT.\n \n \n \n \nHer opinion of course, you do realize that AG of Texas, Gonzales (who is now Bush's AG) called her actions activist later on?  \n\n \n Wrong again.\n \n \nOwen's Doe decision gets so much attention not because of anything it says. Rather, all the attention is focused on then-Justice Alberto Gonzales's concurrence, in which he wrote that to construe Texas's parental-notification-for-abortion statute too narrowly would be \"an unconscionable act of judicial activism.\" Some believe this remark was directed at Justice Owen's dissent - a charge Gonzales now denies. Whatever then-Justice Gonzales meant by his remarks - a question Ramesh Ponnuru addresses here - it is hard to read anything in Owen's opinion as particularly \"activist.\" \n\n \n http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1408904/posts\n \n \n \n \n \nWas this action activist? Where does it say that in the federal consitution discrimnation is okay? \n\n \n It doesn't, therefore it's up to the states, or to the people. In this case, both at the same time.\n \n \nIf you consider that activst, then you must consider Owen's replacing of the legislated law by Texas activist: therefore making you a flaming hypocrite. But apparently you cannot deal with that, Are you AFRAID? \n\n \n No, not afraid at all, because it wasn't activist. It was her knowledge and respect of the traditional authority of trial courts.\n \n \n \nIt is irrevelant. The intent of the framers included not legislating upon religious reasons. DID YOU MISS THAT PART?   I grow tired of your seemingly endless supply of undiluted, uneducated sheer idiocy as well as your failures and webs of contridicitions and hypocritical actions. \n\n \n Back to the non-partisan link you missed.\n \n \n Natural law (higher law, God's law) is now only infrequently suggested as an interpretive guide, even though many of the framers of the Constitution recognized its appropriateness.  \n \n \n If you don't agree with that, say so. If you don't believe George Washington proclaimed a national day of prayer, say so. \n \n \n \n \nYou know nothing. Absolutely nothing. Judicial gap filling is what Owen DID. She filled the gap she saw with her intepretation. According to your own logic, OWEN IS A ACTIVIST, but then again, you are too afraid to admit that.\n\n \n And you still have no clue what judicial activism is. I see you sent not one, but TWO hate filled PM's to me last night. You don't like debate much, do you?",

He's one of many, many analysts for Fox news, many of whom are extreme liberal. Alan Colmes, Ellis Hennican, Elanor Clift - come to mind right away. I don't get my views from a news source anyway. I've heard Napolitano's opinion many times - I agree with him usually. I don't agree this time. He thinks recent, reinvented use of the word activist by liberals is comparable to actual activism that's been going on in some degree since the beginning of this country, but mainly since 1960. He's let your buddies Kennedy & Schumer bully him into not wanting to get involved in what he would consider to be meaningless debate.\n \n Send me 3 or 4 hate PM's tonight if it makes you feel better - it only takes me a second to delete them.",

   "I'm not going to base my belief upon a obviously partisan website. \n\n \n The first parts, the introduction and the \"eight reasons\" descriptions are completely non-partisan. The statements by Posner & Bork are their own words and right there for you to compare - you can't get much more non-partisan than that. It's quite enough for you to make a decision about how you basically stand. \n \n The last half of the page - Posner's essay with several Bork put-downs, was partisan all right, partisan LEFT.\n \n \nI find it amusing that you hold such a belief yet you do not even bother to research. \n\n \n I find it amusing that you think you know what I research and what I do not. I do notice a pattern though, the more I research, the more names you call me. \n \n \n \nThe one where you claimed all or the majority of my links were from liberal sites. Oh yes, you failed there. I even offered you money and you still failed horribly. \n\n \n That has nothing to do with this link. It wasn't worth the trouble anyway, it's too obvious. Your juvenile offers of money aren't what these forums are for. \n \n \nYou're still avoiding your own logic. If Owen is not a activist for applying her own interpretation then all judges who do that are not activist. You are clearly using a double standard as well as being a flaming hypocrite. \n\n \n It depends on what criteria they use to interpret. Text and intent, or evolving standards and gap-filling. No double standard, no hypocrisy. A true hypocrite would be someone who labels someone an activist judge, then claims he DOESN'T KNOW ENOUGH to decide how to classify his own very basic judicial philosophy. \n \n \n \nBecause all links you post are non-partisan, yet all links I post are partisan. talk about idiocy and a sheer lack of any intelligence upon your part. \n\n \n I never said that, nor implied it. About all my links are partisan - the one above is probably the first from me that doesn't lean right. But notice something about my partisan \"Free Republic\" link as opposed to your partisan left links. Mine takes you to all the relevant words of Gonzalas himself, it helps let the reader decide for himself. Your three do not - almost no reference to Owen's or Gonzalas' exact words.\n \n \nMore idiocy. Gonazales denies that BECAUSE she was nominated. If he didn't believe that he wouldn't have said it. Notice when he said that \n and when owen was looked to as a candidate. You'll find your are not only a rambling, uneducated, dimwitted idiot, but wrong as usual.  \n\n \n He said he believed it, but said it wasn't directed at her. \n \n \n \nThen they aren't a activist. \n\n \n Please think before you post. Joseph Bataillon was an activist - he disregarded the 10th amendment.\n \n \n \n \nhow dumb are you?\n \n It's not activist to you because you don't want it to be. She clearly unsurped both the power of the people and of the consitution. Simply because you don't want to admit it doesn't mean, one that you're wrong, and two you're a idiot. \n\n \n She respected the authority of the trial courts. But I've already shown that, you just won't pay attention. \n \n \"Unsurped\" ??? \n \n \nYou are a example of why Americans public school system has failed.\n\n \n Tell me please, does something have to be surped before it can be \"unsurped\"? emoticon_xclown Which school system did YOU attend? \n \n \n \nBack to the partisan link, what does your little, pathetic, uneducated mind not understand about not legislation upon religion?\n\n \n \"Not legislation upon religion\"? My mind understands that it's not in the constitution. \"Separation of church and state\" isn't in there either. Here's what's in the constitution; \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, nor prohibiting the free exersize thereof..... In \"respecting an establishment\", doesn't it make sense that any establishment they were thinking of pertained to 18th century Europe? It's that \"intent of the framers\" thing. They didn't seem to think it was an \"establishment\" to create a Thanksgiving Day. The 10 Commandments are prominently displayed in many federal buildings in D.C. These aren't establishments because no one is forced to look at them, or observe Thanksgiving Day. \"Prohibiting the free exersize thereof\" - if only those words were as common as \"separation of church and state\" are in today's domestic talking points. Activist judges are making progress.\n \n \n \n \ni didn't think anyone could be as stupid as you are. But then again...here you are not denying you are faking it. As for not liking debate, you seem to avoid dealing with your own failures and keep rehasing the same refutated arguimentes over and over agian.\n\n \n Is it just me, am I the only one you insult and call names, or is it everyone in the U.S.(50% +) who agrees in some way with the current administration? Can you show a thread here where you've debated someone who agreed with the current administration in some way that you didn't insult and call names?",
