   "By Kirk Semple\n The New York Times\n \n Sunday 04 April 2004\n \n The terrorist strikes of Sept. 11, 2001, could have been prevented had the United States government acted sooner to dismantle Al Qaeda and responded more quickly to other terrorist threats, the chairman of the commission investigating the attacks said today, even as the White House sought to dispel the notion that the attacks were avoidable.\n \n Thomas H. Kean, chairman of the commission and former Republican governor of New Jersey, said that had the United States seized early opportunities to kill Osama bin Laden in the years before Sept. 11, \"the whole story would've been different.\"\n \n Mr. Kean's comments on the NBC News program \"Meet the Press\" echoed statements he made in December and January. But he emphatically declared that additional months of testimony and investigation had not altered his view.\n \n \"What we've found now on the commission has not changed that belief because there were so many threads and so many things, individual things, that happened,\" he said. \"And if some of those things hadn't happened the way they happened,\" the attacks could have been prevented.\n \n His comments came four days before President Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, was scheduled to testify before the commission, which is investigating the circumstances surrounding Sept. 11 and scrutinizing the actions of both the Bush and Clinton administrations. Last week President Bush bowed to political pressure and agreed to allow Ms. Rice to testify.\n \n The White House has insisted there was nothing that could have been done to prevent the Sept. 11 attacks. The White House spokesman Scott McClellan said last month that charges by Richard Clark, Mr. Bush's former terrorism chief, that the administration could have done more to prevent the attacks were \"deeply irresponsible,\" \"offensive,\" and \"flat-out false.\" Ms. Rice, in an interview on the CBS News program \"60 Minutes\" last week, insisted that the Bush administration regarded terrorism as \"an urgent problem\" before Sept. 11. \"I would like very much to know what more could have been done given that it was an urgent problem,\" she said.\n \n Karen P. Hughes, a top political adviser to President Bush, reinforced that position in an appearance today on \"Meet the Press.\"\n \n \"I don't believe that anyone in the Bush administration - and I'm not an advocate of the Clinton administration, but I'll even include them in this - I don't believe that anyone in the Clinton administration either could have put together the pieces before the horror of Sept. 11,\" Ms. Hughes said. \"I don't think we could have envisioned it and done anything to perhaps prevented it.\"\n \n The panel's vice chairman, Lee H. Hamilton, who appeared alongside Mr. Kean this morning on NBC, was more circumspect than his colleague on the issue of inevitability. \"You can string together a whole bunch of ifs,\" said Mr. Hamilton, a former Democratic House member from Indiana. \"If things had broken right in all kinds of different ways as the governor has identified and many more, and frankly, if you'd had a little luck, it could probably have been prevented.\"\n \n The commission officials said they expected to finish their report by July. By law, they said, they have to submit the document to the White House for review before it is publicly released to ensure that it contains nothing that would compromise national security.\n \n \"They go through it line by line,\" Mr. Kean said.\n \n Both men acknowledged that the law gives the White House exclusive control over the release of intelligence information, but Mr. Hamilton insisted the panel would not permit the White House to \"distort\" the report.\n \n \"We do not want to put out a report with heavy redactions in it,\" he said. Mr. Kean said he was confident that the White House would complete its review quickly in order to permit the report's public release well in advance of the presidential election in November.\n \n \"I think it's in the White House's interest, our interest, everybody's interest to get this out in July,\" he said.\n \n Presidents Bush and Clinton and Vice Presidents Dick Cheney and Al Gore are scheduled to appear before the commission. But while Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore are going to appear separately, Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney will appear together, an arrangement that has drawn criticism from some Democratic leaders. Mr. Kean said the members of the panel \"don't see any problems with it,\" though he allowed that \"maybe we would have rather had them one at a time.\"\n \n While the dates that Mr. Bush, Mr. Clinton, Mr. Cheney and Mr. Gore have not been publicly announced, Ms. Rice is scheduled to testify on Thursday. Mr. Kean said he expected her testimony, scheduled for two and a half hours, to reveal \"what she heard and what she knew,\" and to shed light on the differences between the policies of the Bush administration and the policies of the Clinton administration.\n \n Madeleine K. Albright, President Bill Clinton's secretary of state, insisted this morning on the ABC News program \"This Week\" that with the Bush administration \"there was kind of a dismissal of everything that the Clinton administration had done\" to combat terrorism. \"We were working very hard on this issue,\" she added.\n \n John F. Lehman, Navy secretary in the Reagan administration and a Republican member of the commission, said today that he viewed Ms. Rice's testimony as \"much more important\" than either Mr. Bush's or Mr. Cheney's.\n \n \"She was right at the nexus 24 hours a day,\" he explained on the CBS News program \"Face the Nation.\" \"She was the conduit to the president and the coordinator of national security policy.\" He added: \"She really has the view that we need to establish the facts.\"",

   "As anti-Saddam as I am, killing him wouldn't have prevented 9/11. He's not in this with al-Qaeda...they share a hatred of Americans, but that's about it. Saddam is a Sunni and Osama (I think, I could very well be wrong) is Shi'ite, and they disagree with each other on alot. Was Saddam in favor of terorism? Yeah, his links with Palestinian suicide bombers prove that. I don't think he was all close with al-Qaeda, but I do suspect that they would offer minimal support to each other to kill Americans.\n \n I don't know about killing Osama. Do we know when they came up with this idea? If it was already in motion, it wouldn't have stopped 9/11. We could have killed him years ago, before al-Qaeda was built up, like in the early years of Clinton's admin. I'm not blaming Clinton for that though, in the early 90's Osama hadn't displayed how much of a threat he was. Towards the later 90's, yeah, Clinton should have done something, and he's at fault for that. He should have retaliated for the attacks on the Cole, on the embassies, etc etc.\n \n Killing Osama would have an impact, but the thing to remember is that after his death, any number of people with similar ideologies could have taken over and would have attacked America. The only way we could have prevented this is or to prevent it from occuring again is to dismantle al-Qaeda. Osama isn't the key to that logically, but symbolically and psychologically, he is.",

   "Not if a few thousand bucks less go to palestinian terrorists.\n And not by removing Saddam earlier.\n\n \n But can you be sure? That is the what if game of this whole investigation. Who exactly is to blame? Is it Clinton because I'm sure he had tons of info on possible terrorists who he did nothing about each of which may have played some role in 9/11? Is it Bush because he may have been given some info on something that seemed a one in a million possibility and didn't act on it?\n \n I also doubt that Saddam played a key role in 9/11 occuring either directly or indirectly but Saddam was a funder of terrorists and we ignored him after the first gulf war. Are those people not also possibly responsible for ignoring Saddam even if it seems unlikely the two are linked? I think there is just an endless list of possibilities and people to point the finger at. In the end the fact is that we not only were not prepared but also didn't feel the need to be prepared. Terrorists don't strike America. They strike overseas in Japan and Israel, not here. That was the simple mentality we had. That is why even if Clinton had Osama handed to him on a silver platter and turned it away I cannot just blame Clinton for this occurrance.
