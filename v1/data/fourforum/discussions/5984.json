Furthermore, I believe that heterosexuality is natural and I will provide my children an environment where heterosexuality is the norm; I believe that sexuality is not necessarily a conscious decision, but it is influenced by both genetics and environment.\n\n \n Well, I should say that I know of no science, studies or statistics which suggest that opposite-sex parents are a better environment to bear or raise children than same-sex couples. Looking through some of the older posts on this forum, you may find several studies which suggest that same-sex couples are just as good or better environments, though I don't recall any suggesting the opposite. If it is simply your belief that heterosexuality is natural, who am I to complain? Raise your children and live your life as you see fit. And I too believe that sexuality is influenced by both genetics and environment. But I also believe that same-sex couples should be treated the same as opposite-sex couples. Same-sex couples are people too, and they're people with the same needs. I do not ask that you believe them to be as good at raising as you.

In fact, there are many instances at common law that recognize marriage as between a man and a woman; but none that recognize marriage as a union between two consenting adults.\n\n \n Certainly there has been a strong history of male-female marriages. And certainly marriage was originally intended to be between males and females. But that original intention doesn't make it right. Looking at our marriage laws today, we can see that there is inequality; we can see that same-sex couples exist and have the same need for marriage benefits as opposite-sex couples. Seeing this today, does it not make you wonder why we put a restriction on marriage in the first place? Why did we say that individuals cannot grant these benefits to one another if they are of the same sex? We have restricted many things in the past, but that does not mean we have restricted them for good reason.\n \n \nEssentially, there can be no question about it: marriage is legally between a man and a woman; based on either the federal statutory DoMA (or the state equivalents) or the common law recognition.\n\n \n Well, of course not all states have DoMA equivalents, and one even allows same-sex marriage. The legal benefits we call \"marriage\" are whatever the government makes them to be. There is no doubt that marriage is currently between a man and a woman in most places in the US, but I'm not contesting that. It is the morality of that law I am debating.\n \n \nIf you want to change the law, go ahead and do so. But do it legitimately, and don't try to redefine preexisting definitions through judicial activism.

All the gay and bisexual people in the nation cannot do it alone. I need people who understand that it is wrong to deny benefits to same-sex couples while granting benefits to opposite-sex couples. I need people to realize that our current laws treat people unfairly, and I need people to be outraged at that. It is cause for outrage, I think, that we should have a special set of legal rights designed specifically for heterosexuals, designed, it seems, to grant preferrential treatment.\n \n I guess that you are part of the group recieving prefferential treatment, but that does not make it moral to see unfair treatment and do nothing about it.

But that right is in its nature discriminatory. Tell me, what if the right read \"every individual has the right to marry whoever they want, so long as that person is not Christian.\" Certainly the right would be granted to everyone, but that right holds a restriction. That restriction is the discriminatory part; it is designed to prevent Christians from marrying. In the same sense, every person has the right to marry, but that right has a restriction on it designed specifically to prevent gay people from marrying.\n \n Everyone may have the same rights, but that bears no indication on whether those rights are unfair or discriminatory. Marriage has a restriction on it which is blatantly designed to restrict gay people from engaging in it. To suggest that our laws do not favor heterosexuals is either dishonest or the result of an unreasoned belief that \"the same\" necessitates \"not discriminatory\".\n \n \nThe original intent of marriage was to encourage monogamy and (to a lesser extent) give rights to parents to raise children.

Yet there is no reason that we should not encourage monogamy and give rights to parents to raise children, simply because those parents are of the same sex. There is no reason that we should not \"reward\" same-sex marriages in the same fashion that we reward opposite-sex marriages. The unfair part of this is that we reward heterosexual marriages but we do not provide that same reward for homosexual marriages.\n \n \nIf you view marriage laws as restrictive and punishing non-married couples, then you should also argue for similar benefits for unmarried couples. A lives with his girlfriend B for a few years, but they don't want to get married.

The legal set of benefits granted to any couple happens to be named \"marriage\", but it's just a name. Anyone can apply for and recieve those benefits, whether religiously married or not. If you are suggesting that we should create some seperate set of legal benefits under the law which accomplishes the same thing as legal marriage; I cannot see any reason for that.\n \n \nYou can defend or attack the morality of that law, but any law based on morality (yes, even equality of a certain group) must meet with the approval of the majority of a population to be accepted.\n\n \n What? I don't understand this claim. In our nation, no law based on morality must meet with the approval of the majority of the population to be accepted. The legislature can pass whatever laws legislating morality that they please. Judges can rule that the majority's opinion violates the Constitution. In a representative democracy, the only way the majority opinion affects the law is in that they elect public officials.\n \n Besides that, I wasn't talking about a law legislating morality at all. I was talking about morality in general. It is a moral action to work for a law that treats people fairly, that helps people. It is an immoral action to fail to work against a law that treats people unfairly and that hurts people. A law allowing same-sex marriage would in no way be a legislation of morality, but it is moral to support such a law.\n \n \nHow many laws get changed for a minority of people? Lots!\n How do they get the laws changed if they can't form a majority? They convince the majority that their position is the right one.\n\n \n And that is precisely why I'm trying to convince you that my position is the right one. You suggested that I should change the law if I want. I do want to change the law, but I can't. I need you to support me as well; I need millions of people to support me. What I mean is, don't just watch people being treated unfairly, and tell them \"If you don't like it, change the law\". Help us change the law.\n \n \nInstead of demonizing the anti-gay movement and trying to win support through negativity, build up your own position and present positive arguments in favor of gay marriage.\n\n \n I primarly attempt to support same-sex marriage by listing the positives of same-sex marriage. I have listed those positives many times before, and perhaps I have suggested them even in my posts in this discussion we are having. I do not try to discredit or demonize anyone, though I do what I can to discredit the arguments my opponents present. I will present my arguments in support of same-sex marriage again, for you, if you request it.\n \n So I guess I don't understand why you are telling me not to demonize the anti-gay movement. I try not to do that; I believe they are causing harm to many, but I understand that they are well-intentioned.\n \n \nThat's just it, you're guessing. I could be someone who's not receiving preferential treatment; and you'll likely never know. My views are not based on a cost/benefit analysis.\n\n \n Well, I may never know for certain whether you are recieving preferrential treatment; that depends only on your willingness to tell me. However, you did state this: \"I believe that heterosexuality is natural and I will provide my children an environment where heterosexuality is the norm\", which is, I think, sufficient evidence to present my guess.\n \n My views are based on a cost/benefit analysis. Legalizing same-sex marriage helps same-sex couples, it helps the children of same-sex couples, and it harms no one. Keeping same-sex marriage illegal harms same-sex couples, harms their children, and it helps no one. We are choosing between helping people or harming them, and the majority is choosing to harm them.\n \n If your views are not based on a cost/benefit analysis, then what are they based on? Desire to promote your own lifestyle or beliefs? A belief that straight people deserve more than gay people? A desire to discourage others from acting in a fashion you consider unnatural? I don't consider any of those just or moral reasons. Treat others as you would like them to treat yourself.\n \n \nThe concept of judicial activisim is central to the current gay rights movement. Rather than trying to win people over to their side to win on the books, they are going right to the courts and trying to change things through judges who share their views. That's wrong, and an abuse of the system.\n\n \n You are paying more attention to media coverage than to the actions of gay rights organizations or supporters. It is true that the gay rights movement has found the most success in courts and judicial systems, but that doesn't mean that such things are their focus. We push the legislature to pass bills supporting gay rights, with countless successes, though few dealing with the topic of marriage itself. In California, a bill is being considered in the legislature to allow same-sex marriage. We work to support candidates that support same-sex marriage. I went door-to-door for Kerry, I went door-to-door with my newly elected state legislator (last year); we got together and did mailings every week, and we're doing a few this year too. I've spoken to groups in support of same-sex marriage. I've participated in gay political rallys. I deliver literature supporting gay rights. I try to convince people I meet to support gay rights. I brought in \"No On Proposal 2\" signs to my work, when Proposal 2 was adding an ammendment to ban same-sex marriage to the Michigan Constitution, and I took election day off work to hand out literature opposing Proposal 2 all day, facing many people who looked at me with disgust. I write letters to my legislators. And as you can see, I post on forums to try to get people to support gay rights.\n \n Every one of those things is an effort to convince the majority of people to support gay rights or to get gay rights bills passed through the legislature. You know what I've never done? I've never contacted a judge. I've never taken a gay rights issue to court. I've never done anything involving the court system. But a few judges issue a few rulings in favor of same-sex marriage, and the media explodes that and covers it like crazy, and suddenly everyone believes that \"the gay rights movement is about activist judges\". Well frankly, that's just a myth perpetuated by people who know nothing more about gay rights than what some newspaper decides is a big story.",

   "...suddenly everyone believes that \"the gay rights movement is about activist judges\". Well frankly, that's just a myth perpetuated by people who know nothing more about gay rights than what some newspaper decides is a big story.\n Originally from the New York Times: \nThese Activist Judges?\n When Democrats or Republicans seek to criticize judges or judicial nominees, they often resort to the same language. They say that the judge is \"activist.\" But the word \"activist\" is rarely defined. Often it simply means that the judge makes decisions with which the critic disagrees.\n In order to move beyond this labeling game, we've identified one reasonably objective and quantifiable measure of a judge's activism, and we've used it to assess the records of the justices on the current Supreme Court.\n \n Here is the question we asked: How often has each justice voted to strike down a law passed by Congress?\n \n Declaring an act of Congress unconstitutional is the boldest thing a judge can do. That's because Congress, as an elected legislative body representing the entire nation, makes decisions that can be presumed to possess a high degree of democratic legitimacy. \n \n * * *\n \n Since the Supreme Court assumed its current composition in 1994, by our count it has upheld or struck down 64 congressional provisions. That legislation has concerned Social Security, church and state, and campaign finance, among many other issues. We examined the court's decisions in these cases and looked at how each justice voted, regardless of whether he or she concurred with the majority or dissented.\n \n We found that justices vary widely in their inclination to strike down congressional laws. Justice Clarence Thomas, appointed by President George H.W. Bush, was the most inclined, voting to invalidate 65.63 percent of those laws; Justice Stephen Breyer, appointed by President Bill Clinton, was the least, voting to invalidate 28.13 percent.\n \n Here is our listing of the justices:\n \n Thomas 65.63%\n Kennedy 64.06%\n Scalia 56.25%\n Rehnquist 46.88%\n O'Connor 46.77%\n Souter 42.19%\n Stevens 39.34%\n Ginsburg 39.06%\n Breyer 28.13%\n \n One conclusion our data suggests is that those justices often considered more \"liberal\" -- justices Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David Souter and John Paul Stevens -- vote least frequently to overturn congressional statutes, while those often labeled \"conservative\" vote more frequently to do so. At least by this measure (others are possible, of course), the latter group is the most activist.\n",

It should also be noted that I support judges acting in an activist fashion more often than not, yet in the case of same-sex marriage it is my understanding that those who oppose same-sex marriage are the activists.\n \n Still, my point was not to discuss whether activism is a good thing. It was to say that the gay rights movement is in no way related to activist judges, nor is the gay rights movement focused on using activist judges or the court system, nor does the gay rights movement have any control over whether a judge will rule in an activist or strict-constitutionalist fashion in a particular case, and it should not be held responsible for those judicial rulings.",

They are wrong when they rule against it.\n \n The Dred Scott decision decreed that an escaped slave be forced to return to slavery. It is viewed as one of the worst decisions of the court.

It is worth being labeled an activist if your decision is going to help people.\n \n \nIf you try to use the courts to gain gay marriage (which requires subjective interpretation of what's already there), your movement is indeed related to it.\n\n \n One of our amendments states that citizens are entitled equal protection of the laws. Placing a restriction on marriage which is designed to prevent some people from recieving marriage benefits is a denial of equal protection of the laws, for marriage benefits are laws which protect only some. In a sense, marriage is both a set of civil rights and legal contracts, including the right to extend medical insurance, the right to claim dependants, the right to naturalize, as well as property contracts, etc. Protecting the right of individuals to engage in marriage constitutes a protection of the laws. Interpreting the Constitution exactly as it is written, I do not see how a logical argument can be presented which opposes same-sex marriage, especially considering prior court rulings stating that seperate cannot be equal. However, if we consider the context in which those laws were written and the intent of the authors, it should be very clear that the authors did not intend to protect the equality of same-sex couples and access to marriage.\n \n It takes an activist judge, a judge willing to interpret the spirit of the Constitution, the intention of the authors, to determine that the Constitution does not protect same-sex marriage.\n \n More importantly, it is the judges whose job it is to determine what the Constitution says. If some people in a movement believe the Constitution protects them, and they take that case to the courts, it is the courts' decision whether or not they are right.

If I agree with the court, I believe they have made a correct decision; if I disagree, I believe they have made an incorrect decision. If I believe that the court's ruling is very harmful, I generally do not consider it a good ruling simply because they \"stuck with the exact wording of the constitution\" instead of looking for its spirit.\n \n You're right that if most of our founding fathers rose from the grave this very day; they'd be shocked to see what has happened. But that doesn't mean they wouldn't be wrong, and it doesn't mean they wouldn't learn to understand why they were wrong. As Jefferson said, we are unable to see beyond the culture we were born into.\n \n There are few laws protecting marriage, it is true. One of the few is the Supreme Court ruling in Mass. which allowed same-sex couples to marry. Protecting marriage doesn't involve keeping the gays from it; it involves protecting everyone's right to use it. Denying people marriage doesn't protect marriage; it hurts it, by every definition of harm.\n \n \nThe 14th. Yet there is at least one amendment giving civil rights that came after that. If the 14th was meant to be taken so broadly as an all-inclusive-amendment-to-end-all-amendments, the 19th would not have been needed.\n\n \n But that is activist thinking you are using. You are trying to interpret what the author meant to write instead of what the Constitution actually says. You are trying to rule based on the spirit of the Constitution, not it's actual words. In its words, the 14th Amendment does guarantee women the same right to vote as men. Saying, \"Well, he probably didn't mean it to apply to everyone.\" is an activist thing to do. That is why the judges that oppose same-sex marriage are activists. Though I of course don't agree with that activist decision; you should understand that activism is not some horrible thing. It's only made to sound that way by people who disagree with court rulings and use the term to try to claim that judges abused their position. In reality, it usually makes a lot of sense to be an activist.\n \n On another note, with Lockian thinking suggesting that women should be allowed to vote, and that same idea being reflected in Jefferson's writings, it should not be unheard of if the author of the 14th Amendment might actually have hoped that it could eventually be used to protect women's rights.\n \n \nBut that's just it--it's not designed to prevent some from marrying. It's just following what our society knows marriage to be.\n\n \n But our society knows marriage to be something exclusive, something only between men and women. Marriage as a whole is not designed around denying rights to gay people, but the specific restriction that marriage is between two people of the opposite-sex is designed to deny rights to gay people. It may be that our society thinks marriage to be a right denied to gay people, but our society still has no business putting marriage into law and denying it to gay people. If we're going to put something into law, make it a legal benefit and civil right, then we've got to apply that fairly. Society has no business taking something they consider an exclusive institution and using it as an excuse to give only some people legal rights and benefits.\n \n \nIf the best you can do is to rely on the \"spirit\" of the constitution to ascertain that, then gay marriage is probably doomed in this country, in the long run. The spirit of the constitution is always going to be a subjective matter. It's interesting that rather than relying on the spirit of the constitution, amendments were added that plainly spelled out the rights black people were guaranteed. Why would you not want to go the same route?\n\n \n Well, don't get me wrong; I'd love to pass amendments that plainly spell out the rights of homosexuals, as that would be better than nothing. Though in a very real sense, plainly spelling out the rights that people are guaranteed is a bad idea. Doing so gives both the people and the government the idea that it is okay to violate any person's right any time, so long as it isn't specifically listed on the \"protected list\". There was even opposition to the Bill of Rights by Hamilton and Madison because they believed that it would change people's thinking from \"Here's what the government can do\" to \"Here's what the government can't do, any they can do anything else they want.\" That second sort of thinking leads to government tyranny; it's impossible to list everything the government shouldn't be able to control.\n \n When Madison wrote the Bill of Rights, he tried to protect the government from overstepping its bounds by providing that any powers unlisted shall go to the states, and the Bill of Rights should not be interpreted as an open door for governments to violate any rights already held by the people. Those were the 9th and 10th Amendments. When it was determined that the government was able to live by the 9th and 10th Amendments while still treating people unfairly, the 14th Amendment was passed in an attempt to prevent unfair treatment in general. Those Amendments are designed to keep the power of the government limited by preserving the idea that the government doesn't have free reign to deny any rights unlisted.\n \n I would rather it be determined that the government can't treat same-sex couples unfairly because of the 14th Amendment. If that happens, we will be setting a precedent that limits the power of the government; we'll be promoting the idea that the government can't treat people unfairly simply because the majority thinks it's a good idea. If an Amendement is necessary which spells out the rights of gay people, we are promoting the idea that the government can do whatever it wants, unless the Constitution specifically prohibits it. That isn't a good way to prevent tyranny and government interference.",

It's why that with every step backward you take our nation, the nation takes another step or two forward in reaction by ballot initiatives or the possibility of an amendment that defines marriage.

Arguably, because of the reaction that ensued, one of the worst things that has happened for the gay rights movement was Massachusetts recognizing gay marriage. Partially as a result, Bush was re-elected and now possibly 2 or 3 SCOTUS judges will be appointed by him. And of course he'll appoint constitutionalist judges and actively works against appointing activist ones, making it harder for your movement. I don't think you really realize the extent it turned people off to your movement.\n \n \nBut that is activist thinking you are using. You are trying to interpret what the author meant to write instead of what the Constitution actually says. You are trying to rule based on the spirit of the Constitution, not it's actual words. In its words, the 14th Amendment does guarantee women the same right to vote as men. Saying, \"Well, he probably didn't mean it to apply to everyone.\" is an activist thing to do.\n\n \n It seems to me that you are the one interpreting the 14th amendment by what it doesn't specify. If the 14th guarantees \"women the same right to vote as men\" as you say, then why was the 19th added later? The point is that taking any behavior that comes along, no matter what society thinks about it and trying to legitimize it with the 14th amendment is a complete misuse of the constitution. Remember, the 14th guarantees 'life, liberty, and property.\" You have all those rights already as a gay person. In fact the 14th came along before most of all of the marriage benefits available now. How can you say the founders meant for the phrase \"life, liberty, and property\" to apply to marriage benefits when marriage benefits weren't really a reality at all?\n \n \nThat is why the judges that oppose same-sex marriage are activists. Though I of course don't agree with that activist decision; you should understand that activism is not some horrible thing.\n\n \n Activism most certainly IS a horrible thing when it's done from the bench--that's not what the judiciary is for. We're really talking about political activism, not just actively being a judge. Judges that interpret the constitution by what it says instead of what they think it should say would naturally not rule in favor of gay marriage. That's not activist, it's being constitutionalist.\n \n \nIt's only made to sound that way by people who disagree with court rulings and use the term to try to claim that judges abused their position. In reality, it usually makes a lot of sense to be an activist.\n\n \n Judges should be impartial, and judge based on what the constitution says.\n \n \nOn another note, with Lockian thinking suggesting that women should be allowed to vote, and that same idea being reflected in Jefferson's writings, it should not be unheard of if the author of the 14th Amendment might actually have hoped that it could eventually be used to protect women's rights.\n\n \n The 14th came well after Jefferson and Locke, so you could be right. But the most it can be is subjective to think so, which is really the point.\n \n \nbut our society still has no business putting marriage into law and denying it to gay people. If we're going to put something into law, make it a legal benefit and civil right, then we've got to apply that fairly. Society has no business taking something they consider an exclusive institution and using it as an excuse to give only some people legal rights and benefits.\n\n \n Marriage as society sees it is not denied to anyone. After all it is an opposite-sex institution. Forgive the light analogy, but it's sort of like demanding that computer manufacturers make an equal amount of keyboards that have the number keys on the left hand side instead of the right hand side, since there are many lefties out there. Keyboards, by the way they are made and have always been made, are right-handed implements. But lefties have always had the RIGHT to use these right-handed implements, just as you have always had the right to the opposite-sex institution of marriage. Yes, it's true that you don't want to have an opposite-sex marriag because you are gay, but that's why we should create a different means for you to get the benefits you need, rather than adding left-side number keys to everyone's keyboards . . . er, rather than changing the institution of marriage. \n \n \nWell, don't get me wrong; I'd love to pass amendments that plainly spell out the rights of homosexuals, as that would be better than nothing. \n\n \n \"Better than nothing???\" It's the historically precendented way of doing it. It IS the best way, period. If we are truly a constitutional republic as some here would say, then use the constitution by guaranteeing rights via amendments. That's the way it has historically been done with every group: black people, women, and native americans, to name some. Why would you not be fighting for such an amendment? The constitution is for America, not America for the constitution. I don't understand why gay rights groups aren't fighting for such an amendment, if they want to follow the same vein as previous civil rights cases. (I don't see their's as civil rights at all, but they claim it to be.) The drafters of the constitution didn't intend it to be a static document frozen in time. If they had, they wouldn't have allowed for amendments.\n \n \nI would rather it be determined that the government can't treat same-sex couples unfairly because of the 14th Amendment. If that happens, we will be setting a precedent that limits the power of the government;\n\n \n The problem with your arguement about the 14th amendment is that it is entirely based on who receives it's protections, rather that what it guarantees. IMO, the guarantees of the 14th are protections you already have, as I explained above. Anything else and you'd be getting special rights. I have no problem with the idea that the 14th applies to everyone, including gay people. But the 14th doesn't give you the right to have marriage as an institution changed, so it's a moot point.",

   "A subjective check, at best. The point is, the judiciary doesn't have to be subjective and IMO was not meant to be so.\n\n \n I disagree. Reading the Federalist papers, it is clear that the authors of the Constitution understood that any elected official will try to promote his own beliefs. They designed our government to be effective even factoring in the greed of others. The courts exist to protect the rights of minorities; they are designed to be outside the realm of the power of the majority.\n \n \nAnd again, whether or not it's harmful is in and of itself open to interpretation and is a matter of opinion. I don't see that disallowing gays to change the definition of marriage is harmful.\n\n \n Well, it is not a matter of opinion; one side is right and one side is not, though people cannot agree on it. Certainly I agree that gay people shouldn't be allowed to use the law to define a word; the law has nothing to do with word definitions. Neither should straight people be allowed to use the law to define a word. But I do think it harmful to grant special rights to straight couples that are denied to gay people. They both deserve the same rights.\n \n \nWell, that's the rub, isn't it? I wold say that's where we ultimately disagree, and it's the very core disagreement. Broadening marriage waters it down, IMO, and while you argue that people are being harmed (with no real evidence),\n\n \n With no real evidence? I've explained the reasons that people are being harmed countless times. I've explained why \"watering down\" marriage is actually strengthening it because more people are allowed to engage in it. Your claim that I have provided no evidence requires more evidence, I think.\n \n \nI argue that an institution is being harmed, and that people are being asked unfairly to turn their backs on their moral views by letting this happen. It's why that with every step backward you take our nation, the nation takes another step or two forward in reaction by ballot initiatives or the possibility of an amendment that defines marriage. (A definition of marriage is gay rights' nightmare, as it means marriage is no longer wide open to an anything-goes interpretation.) Arguably, because of the reaction that ensued, one of the worst things that has happened for the gay rights movement was Massachusetts recognizing gay marriage. Partially as a result, Bush was re-elected and now possibly 2 or 3 SCOTUS judges will be appointed by him. And of course he'll appoint constitutionalist judges and actively works against appointing activist ones, making it harder for your movement. I don't think you really realize the extent it turned people off to your movement.\n\n \n I am asking people to turn their backs on their moral views because those moral views are not guided by harms to or the wellbeing of individuals. They are not guided by the desire to help people. They are guided by a religious belief and the desire to reward people for living in agreement with that religious belief. I'm asking people to turn their backs on those moral views only when it comes to writing the law, because they have no place putting their own religious beliefs into law, as superior to someone else's.\n \n Bush didn't get reelected because of same-sex marriage, and Bush will not appoint a strict constitutionalist judge, he'll appoint a conservative one. That conservative judge will be activist when is fits the conservative ideology, and he'll be strict constitutionalist when it fits the conservative ideology. You can tell it already just looking at his stance on abortion. The only place in the Constitution that anyone's right to life is protected is the 14th Amendment, which specifically refers to \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States\". That doesn't mean the Constitution shouldn't protect unborn fetuses, just that its an activist decision.\n \n I do understand that pushing for gay rights has led people to oppose gay rights. But I don't think you understand how worse off we'd be if we hadn't done that. Today, more people support gay rights than ever before. Today, gay people have more rights than ever before. Today, gay rights opponents are actually supporting civil unions. Where do you think we'd be today if we hadn't done that? There is always resistance to a civil rights movement. But nothing can be accomplished if that movement doesn't push forward, overcome resistance as best it can. I am glad that same-sex marriage is legal in some places. At least the same-sex couples there do not have to suffer through being treated unfairly for now, and that is what matters.\n \n \nIt seems to me that you are the one interpreting the 14th amendment by what it doesn't specify. If the 14th guarantees \"women the same right to vote as men\" as you say, then why was the 19th added later? The point is that taking any behavior that comes along, no matter what society thinks about it and trying to legitimize it with the 14th amendment is a complete misuse of the constitution. Remember, the 14th guarantees 'life, liberty, and property.\" You have all those rights already as a gay person. In fact the 14th came along before most of all of the marriage benefits available now. How can you say the founders meant for the phrase \"life, liberty, and property\" to apply to marriage benefits when marriage benefits weren't really a reality at all?\n\n \n I have stated precisely what the 14th Amendment states, and it precisely states that people shall not be denied the equal protection of the law. But simply because it states that does not mean that the people interpreted it to apply to women. It doesn't mean the government interpreted it that way. Activists interpeted the 14th Amendment to not apply to women's voting rights. So another Amendment was necessary.\n \n I did not say that the founders intended the phrase \"life, liberty, and property\" to apply to marriage benefits. But the founders also did not intend for the government to have the power to grant marriage benefits. The founders intended the government to have only the powers explictly spelled out in the Constitution. The founders weren't necessarily right, but they left the government open to be able to adapt to change. The 14th Amendment, on the other hand, guarantees equal protection under the law. That doesn't guarantee marriage benefits, but it does mean that if one couple gets marriage benefits, then another couple is entitled them as well.\n \n \nActivism most certainly IS a horrible thing when it's done from the bench--that's not what the judiciary is for. We're really talking about political activism, not just actively being a judge. Judges that interpret the constitution by what it says instead of what they think it should say would naturally not rule in favor of gay marriage. That's not activist, it's being constitutionalist.\n\n \n You say this, yet you distinctly disagree with the constitutionalist decision to legalize same-sex marriage. You say this, yet in the paragraph above, you were talking specifically about the intention of the author, what the founders \"meant for\" instead of what the founders said. You are speaking in activist terms, not strict constitutionalist ones. I can guarantee that the authors of the 14th Amendment didn't have same-sex marriage in mind when they wrote it. Marriage wasn't even in law at the time. But the Amendment says what it does, and a strict constitutionalist does not care what the intentino of the author was. You are aruging for activism, then you follow it up by stating that activism is a bad thing.\n \n \nJudges should be impartial, and judge based on what the constitution says.\n\n \n When the Constitution answers something directly, judges should agree with that answer and rule accordingly. But an issue doesn't make it to the Supreme Court if the Constitution answers it directly. Any set of words is up for interpretation, and that includes the Constitution. The Supreme Court rules on gray areas of the Constitution, places where the Constitution could mean one thing or another. In those cases, sometimes a judge will rule based on exactly what the Constitution says, and sometimes a judge will rule based on what he thinks the author had in mind.\n \n For example, the second amendment says, \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" A strict constitutionalist judge might say, \"An individual has the right to bear a nuclear weapon. Denying that right is an infringement on his right to bear arms.\" An activist judge might say, \"This amendment was not intended to apply to nuclear weapons; it was intended to preserve an indivudal's right to have adequate means to protect himself, not to have adequate means to kill millions.\" Few judges are purely activist or purely strict constitutionalist.\n \n I would say that when in doubt, a judge should generally rule in favor of protecting the rights of a minority. Their original purpose was to provide a means of protecting the rights of minorities from the overbearing political power of the majority. There are exceptions, however, when sufficient harm exists by protecting that minority's rights, such as in the example of allowing an individual to own a nuclear weapon as described above.\n \n \nThe 14th came well after Jefferson and Locke, so you could be right. But the most it can be is subjective to think so, which is really the point.\n\n \n Yet it is also subjective to think otherwise. If we evaluate the amendment based on its words alone, it does indeed protect the right of women to vote. Though whether or not the author intended it to say that will never be known.\n \n \nMarriage as society sees it is not denied to anyone. After all it is an opposite-sex institution. Forgive the light analogy, but it's sort of like demanding that computer manufacturers make an equal amount of keyboards that have the number keys on the left hand side instead of the right hand side, since there are many lefties out there. Keyboards, by the way they are made and have always been made, are right-handed implements. But lefties have always had the RIGHT to use these right-handed implements, just as you have always had the right to the opposite-sex institution of marriage. Yes, it's true that you don't want to have an opposite-sex marriag because you are gay, but that's why we should create a different means for you to get the benefits you need, rather than adding left-side number keys to everyone's keyboards . . . er, rather than changing the institution of marriage.\n\n \n Well to tell the truth, I think it would be fair for every left-handed person to have a keyboard with a number pad on the left side (okay, well in reality, a left-handed individual is still as able to become adept at the number-pad with his right-hand, but let's assume for the moment he is not), and if I could use my magic to give everyone a keyboard of the same type, then I would. So why don't I argue for left-handed keyboards? Well, first of all, it's an infringement on the rights of the manufacturer to choose what he wants to produce, which would affect the ability of that manufacturer to change what he produces based on market demand. Second, the additonal cost of producing left-handed keyboards does not outweigh the benefit of providing left-handed people with a slightly easier to use number pad.\n \n In the case of same-sex marriage, there is no additional cost, there is no harm, and there are plenty of benefits. We can simply use our magic to allow same-sex couples to marry. Well, it involves a few votes, and a little writing, but it's less than we did to legalize opposite-sex marriage. If all it took was a vote and some writing to make our right-handed keyboards into left-handed, well, I'd vote for that.\n \n \n\"Better than nothing???\" It's the historically precendented way of doing it. It IS the best way, period. If we are truly a constitutional republic as some here would say, then use the constitution by guaranteeing rights via amendments. That's the way it has historically been done with every group: black people, women, and native americans, to name some. Why would you not be fighting for such an amendment? The constitution is for America, not America for the constitution. I don't understand why gay rights groups aren't fighting for such an amendment, if they want to follow the same vein as previous civil rights cases. (I don't see their's as civil rights at all, but they claim it to be.) The drafters of the constitution didn't intend it to be a static document frozen in time. If they had, they wouldn't have allowed for amendments.\n\n \n Nooooooo! We do not guarantee rights via amendments. It is impossible to list out all of the rights the people should have. They are infinite. We guarantee rights by limiting the power of the government, by only allowing it to do what it is explictly allowed to do. If we give the government infinite power except where we've specified otherwise, then we're asking for tyranny.\n \n As I stated, I would love for there to be an amendment granting equal treatment for gay people, but that's only because I'm realistic. There shouldn't have to be one. If you think that I and other gay rights groups are not fighting for an amendment legalizing same-sex marriage, well that's just the most incredibly wrong belief I've ever heard. The primary goal of every gay rights group everywhere is to create such an amendment. You heard that correctly: it isn't just a goal, it is the primary goal. I can't even fathom what would make you think otherwise.\n \n \nThe problem with your arguement about the 14th amendment is that it is entirely based on who receives it's protections, rather that what it guarantees. IMO, the guarantees of the 14th are protections you already have, as I explained above. Anything else and you'd be getting special rights. I have no problem with the idea that the 14th applies to everyone, including gay people. But the 14th doesn't give you the right to have marriage as an institution changed, so it's a moot point.\n\n \n By claiming that each individual is entitled to equal protection under the law, the amendment is specifically stating that one if one person recieves protection under the law, another individual is entitled that same protection. In the case of marriage, it is nothing less than absurd to think that it protects all people equally. Marriage has restrictions on it that prevent it from being used on same-sex couples. You might as well be saying that the 14th Amendment doesn't give you a right to change an institution designed only for white people, if any black person is able to change his skin color. Equal protection under the law mandates that no special restriction be placed on a legal institution that prevents certain people from entering it. It can only be interpeted as \"if the law doesn't provide equal protection, then you must change it so that it does.\" It doesn't say, \"If the law doesn't provide equal protection, that's okay, you shouldn't change it.\" It is not a moot point.",

   "Perhaps, but I feel that my stance is the constitutionalist one. The activist one is to try and read any sort of relationship arrangement into the constitution and use it to redefine what marriage is.\n\n \n That isn't true. The activist stance is nothing of the sort. If a judge is reading anything he wants into the Constitution, that judge is either conservative or liberal. Reading whatever you want is neither an activist or constitutionalist viewpoint. This is not the case with the Supreme Court justices we see today, who cite the precise reasons that they voted the way they did.\n \n \nI didn't say every right had to be listed in the constitution. But if there is a grey or uncertain area, historical precedent certainly allows for guranteeing of rights by amendment. It's blatantly obvious if you read through the amendments that this is the case.\n\n \n Oh, well you're certainly right about that. I wasn't arguing that historical precedent never allows for such a thing. I was simply saying that doing that isn't the best way to preserve freedom. In fact, doing that would be inviting tyranny, if we didn't already have a historical precedent that did it for us.\n \n \nAnd yet I have never read a single post here where someone was proactively arguing for such an amendment. One would certainly think that if it were the primary goal, as you say, there would be many threads here arguing for it.\n\n \n And have you ever read a single post where we suggested any specific legal action be taken? I don't recall making such a post, except possibly in direct response to an article someone posted that discussed a decision. My goal is to protect gay rights in every way possible, and the strongest way is a Constitutional Amendment. Although I'm not directly pushing for one at the moment, and I'm not passing out ballots suggesting one, the only reason I'm not doing that is because we simply don't have the votes to pass such an amendment yet. But that doesn't mean it isn't my goal. On these forums, I never really saw a need state my legal objectives. The debate is over the morality of same-sex marriage and the immorality of opposing it, according to a me (the gay rights supporter).\n \n \nAgain, I don't see marriage benefits being part of the 'equal protections' that 14th mentions. But even if they are, I'm still not against you having them. Just not via marriage.\n\n \n Well, since marriage constitutes a legal protection, and our current definition puts unequal restrictions on marriage, I do not see how marriage benefits could avoid the 14th Amendment, except through an activist approach that looks for the spirit of the Constitution or the intention of the authors. But an activist approach isn't necessarily a bad thing at all, and that's what I want you to understand.\n \n As for benefits, well I'm not opposed to granting legal benefits to gay people through some method other than marriage, I just think we need to give everyone those benefits through the same legal institution. It isn't fair to have some special heterosexual legal institution. Let's just make one legal institution for everyone and let religion work out what is or isn't a marriage.\n \n Regarding a judge's decision on the matter, considering the seperate cannot be equal decisions of past courts, I can't consider them out of line in determining that gay people aren't recieving equal protection without the same rights. It doesn't seem unreasonable to think that two seperate institutions wouldn't be equal anyway.",
