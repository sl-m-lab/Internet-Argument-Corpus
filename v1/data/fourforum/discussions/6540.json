   "I'm all for equality and rights, but there's a certain strain of feminism - often called gender feminism - that I find abhorrent. Feminism is, etymologically, the pursuit of the rights and interests of women without regard for those of men. This sets it apart from egalitarianism, which seeks to balance the two. If you think about it as a spectrum from a totally male-dominated world on one end to a totally female-dominated world on the other, egalitarians want things to be in the middle. Because the world has historically been a bit more male-dominated, egalitarians and feminists have been pulling in the same direction. Now, though, we are at or near that midpoint (in the so-called modern world). Egalitarians are becoming wary of overshooting the mark (which has already happened e.g. with respect to divorce and child-support issues), as are mainstream feminists. Gender feminists, though, are still going full speed ahead toward the other end. It is not enough for them to achieve equality; they want revenge. What they want revenge for might be what their grandfather did to my grandmother, which doesn't make any sense at all, but it's not a rational belief system to begin with. It's a selfish one, based not on principle but on abusing people's feelings of guilt and/or justified righteous anger to get as much as they can.\n \n Unfortunately, the gender feminists wield disproportionate influence in most feminist political organizations such as NOW. That's why the vast majority of women, who actually believe in equality, profess support for traditional feminist ideals but reject the \"feminist\" label. They don't want to be associated with a movement that has ceased to be about equality. They don't want to be complicit in the very same misbehavior toward men that they consider to have been unjust when it was directed toward women. As a man, I oppose the gender feminists for exactly the same reason that I oppose \"traditional values\" chauvinists like Bassman - because I actually care about equality and justice, not identity politics as anr excuse for being obnoxious.",

The real point is that a large part (not all) of the disparity between men's and women's earnings is because of women's choice to earn less and live off someone's income. That doesn't mean they're oppressing men, but - again - it's even less convincing to claim it as evidence that they themselves are oppressed.\n\n \n Choice, education, working experience, age, working hours, working enviroment etc all factor in when someone tries to measure the wage disparity between men and women. Naturally, they should be corrected for if one is interested to find effects of discrimation. However, if one corrects for these factors, the study will be flawed as well since all of these factors are in turn affected by discrimination (women will choose to work in certain busineses because of discrimination in other fields, they choose to stay home with children because of a discriminated wage etc, etc). And even if you do correct for all of these factors completly, you will still find a wage disparity between men and women.\n \n \nNo, but Farrell does. Read the source material before discussing it, folks..\n\n \n Then you should probably have posted this somewhere else. Because if you`re not interested in discussing your claims, but wants to make an advert for a book, I think you should haev put it in the open forum or something.\n \n \nStatistically, it's women. But are they unpaid? If a company gives you a small salary and a large expense account, how should your income be measured?\n\n \n The work is called unapid because there are no official figures concerning their compensation. Just like baking bread is called unpaid work because you don`t offically register the \"earning\".\n \n \nThat's not the claim I was making. Women might live longer than men even if it weren't for stress-related illnesses, but the difference would be a lot less than it is today. Do you know what the male vs. female death rate e.g. from heart attacks is, and how that affects overall life expectancy? You'd better, or else you have little cause to be making claims about the difference being innate.\n\n \n Stress-related illnesses are still dependant on biological and genetic factors. Women live longer than men because of biological reasons. Just like men are stronger and faster than women...",

   "How about citing the actual figures and how they where measured (ie; methodology, survey groups etc, etc)?\n\n Well, I'm sorry, but I was at work when I posted before and didn't even have my copy handy. Now I have it in front of me, and I can do a better job. From Myth of Male Power (Berkley paperback, 1994) on page 33 we find this:\n \nOverall, women control consumer spending by a wide margin in virtually every consumer category(17).\n ...\n (17)See Diane Crispell, \"The Brave New World,\" American Demographic, January 1992, p. 38.\n\n On page 57 there's this, on another topic we've discussed.\n \nIn 1991, the Journal of Economic Literature reported that while women still do about seventeen hours more of work inside the home per week, men do about twenty-two more hours of work outside the home per week, including commuting time).(12)\n ...\n (12)F.Thomas Juster and Frank P. Stafford, \"The Allocation of Time: Empirical Findings, Behavioral Models, and Problems Measurement,\" Journal of Economic Literature, vol. 29, no. 2, June 1991, p. 477.\n\n There's a whole chapter (chapter 7) devoted to why the question of why women live longer. I could keep quoting sources from there, but I think you get the point. This stuff is backed up by scientific evidence, even if it isn't conveniently available on the web. Go visit your local library. I think I've done more than my share of other people's research already, and it's time for the opposition to ante up.\n \nThe stronger sex \n \n And all websites I could find talked about biological reasons, not stress due to more work (which would be very odd since women work as much, if not more, just not for a wage)\n \n And, of course, we can`t discount intelligence :p \n \n Why women live longer than men \n\n I think I've seen the second one before, but it's still good. Thanks for a good laugh. :)\n \n As for the first, I'd consider it weak evidence at best. Consider this:\n \nDavid Goldspink, who revels in the title of Professor of Cell and Molecular Sports Science at John Moores, and his colleagues looked at 250 volunteers aged between 18 and 80 over the course of two years. All the volunteers were healthy but physically inactive. The team's principal finding was that the power of the male heart falls by 20-25% between the ages of 18 and 70, while that of the female heart remains undiminished.\n ...\n In a related study, the team found that the hearts of veteran male athletes were as powerful as those of inactive 20-year-old male undergraduates.\n\n This shows that the female body responds to a sedentary lifestyle better, but that's not the same as a general advantage. In fact, the women I know generally exercise more than their male counterparts, in part because the men are likely to be desk-bound all day. Farrell has this to say, on page 182 (emphasis his):\n \nWhen women and men have equal life expectancies, it seems to be because women die not only in childbirth (fewer than thought) but about equally from contagious, parasitic diseases; poor sanitation and water; inadequate health care; and diseases of malnutrition. In industrialized societies, early deaths are caused more by diseases triggered by stress, which breaks down the immune system. It is since stress has become the key factor that men have died so much sooner than women.\n\n There's also a table showing the gender ratios for the top 15 causes of death, with stress-related causes prominent - 1.9:1 for heart disease (#1), 2.7:1 for accidents, 3.9:1 for suicide, 2.0:1 for homicide. None of these 15 afflict women more - not even cancerous cysts at #2. Accidents and homicide are significant because there's another whole chapter devoted to the way the most dangerous professions (especially the military) are all dominated by men. Being overrpresented in professions where injury and death is likely hardly seems like a signifier of male dominance. With regard to genetic factors specifically, Farrell says this:\n \nthe vulnerability of men because of their social role cannot be separated from their vulnerability because of their biology. For example, when men reflexively rescue women, they are not only more likely to get physically stabbed, shot, or punched but these rescues generate \"emergency hormones.\" For examples, testosterone is generated, but testosterone weakens his immune system; adrenaline (or epinephrine) is generated, but adrenaline also makes his blood to be more likely to clot, making him more vulnerable to heart failure.\n\n It should be noted that these same chemical reactions occur in response to any kind of stress, and that being in an environment where one does not feel in control is stressful. Sound familiar? Try the workplace...but not the home, where the parent enjoys as much sovereignty as a CEO. Given that all of these physiological effects leading inexorably to excess deaths from heart disease are well known, wouldn't a sane society assign gender roles - if they have to be different at all - in a way that minimizes the excess deaths instead of maximizing them?\n \n This isn't to say that overall men are victims of evil women; that's where I disagree with Farrell. I personally don't feel oppressed. The various deals I've worked out with my wife have been voluntary, even if in some instances I seem to get the short end. She still lets me spend time posting stuff online, so it's not all bad. ;) However, it's also clear that in specific ways men get the shaft and need to stop accepting it. As cmitch06 says, \"If you want a truly equal society the only way to erase discrimination is to not let it be such a huge issue.\" Trying to offset one kind of injustice in one area of life or law with another injustice elsewhere simply doesn't work, but that's what happens when we allow policy to be based on gender guilt and those who manipulate us (all of us, of both genders) by it.",

   "Yes. you can have the oppurtunity to be a stay at home dad and you rightly should. Most men don't want that and look poorly on those who do. So it isn't very common. I was making a point that more women will take this option. We can expect all women to join the workforce. More men than women are cut out for that. I'm not making a sexist remark but that is just how we are made. Its like saying women aren't as good in math as guys are. Some may take offense to that but men aren't as good at reading as women are so I mean we can't act like women can do everything a man can do. Some women can don't get me wrong but we are made different. Men can't do everything women can do. We complement each other so well when you think about it. When I said a generation has been born since thinking differently I was being sarcastic. If you read further I was saying this could be the fact but b/c we tell little girls that discrimination keeps them from pursuing what they want we just breed another generation of feminists that are pushing for more. Little girls have all the chance to succeed as little boys do. I mean we act like they need more attention but they a beating the boys in almost every category on standerized test. We need to focus on helping little boys learn. You can't teach boys the same as girls and its time we start realizing that. Their is nothing wrong with teaching boys different than girls. The important thing is that they learn. Girls do better in a controled enviroment where their isn't alot of activities. Where boys learn hands on better. Thats why our young men are falling so far behind. Blasting men on TV and sterotyping is just making men fall into that sterotype. We need to teach young boys how to be a real man. If we fail to do this this society will fail at equality. I think people misjudge what equality is. This society seems to think its where everyone is equal. The statistics should show everyone is equal and if they don't we need to increase Affrimitive Action b/c their must be discrimination somewhere. This will not help fix anything. Equality means that you have an equal shot at achieving what you want. That doesn't mean for some it might be easier but if you set your heart and mind on something you can achieve it. This reverse discrimination(nevermind discrimination-reverse doesn't exist if its discrimination than thats what it is) has done something to females. It has empowered them which is not a bad thing but you have made them feel higher than men not on the same level. You have just reversed the roles and I don't care what the statistics say that is how it is in the real world. You have made them feel as if they can hit a man do whatever they please and they can always be portrayed as the victim. I don't want to make light of those who really are victims, but women have the upper hand b/c unlike men women stay together they take up for each other they work together. Men on the other hand will turn on our best friend and let them do to us whatever they want b/c of what they have between their legs. In a sense that is pathetic. Men dominate the courts but yet they cater to women.",

Their is nothing wrong with teaching boys different than girls. The important thing is that they learn.\n\n Absolutely. Just about every parent, nanny, or babysitter has known this for ages. Whatever the reason, by the time they reach school boys and girls behave and respond differently, and it behooves teachers to take account of that in their teaching methods.\n \n By the way, since you touched on it, the well-known study that purported to show how boys are called on more often than girls in class turned out to be fatally flawed because it didn't distinguish between calling on people in a positive way and calling on them for disciplinary reasons. It's well known that boys are disciplined more often, which casts quite a different light than saying they're called on more often, so any study which fails to make such a distinction is worthless (or worse). It's just another example of what amounts to propaganda from the gender feminists.\n \nWe need to teach young boys how to be a real man.\n\n \"Real man\" is a pretty loaded term. What do you mean by it? Specifically, how is being a real man different than being a real woman?\n \nThis reverse discrimination(nevermind discrimination-reverse doesn't exist if its discrimination than thats what it is) has done something to females. It has empowered them which is not a bad thing but you have made them feel higher than men not on the same level.\n\n Let me share a little anecdote. Back when I was much poorer than I am today, I was looking for a transfer between a really bad job and a slightly less job at a major university. I interviewed, and was unanimously recommended for the position by everyone including the supervisor who was a black woman. I didn't get the job. Why not? The university's employment policy said that if there was a qualified minority applicant they must be hired over non-minority applicants, and there was a black woman who had applied for the job and been deemed qualified (but not recommended). This isn't a \"friend of a friend\" story. This happened to me personally, and I have all this in writing.\n \n Despite such egregious abuse of affirmative action, I still believe it has its place. Some groups are relatively disadvantaged. Our primary means of dealing with that should be by fixing the inequities e.g. in early education, but until we've finished doing that I think there's justification for compensating later e.g. in university admissions. That doesn't mean I believe in quotas, or in just admitting people who are unqualified, or admitting anyone who's on the borderline without also providing additional assistance so they don't just drop out at disproportionate rates. The Supreme Court has said basically the same thing when they have upheld affirmative action as a temporary feature of our social landscape but also said that it should not be allowed to become permanent.\n \n But we digress; general discussions of affirmative action probably belong elsewhere. The point here is that it's not clear women - unlike, say, blacks - are deserving of such special consideration in admissions or hiring. As Farrell says, women are unique among supposedly oppressed groups in that they share the same parents as their supposed oppressors, live in the same households as their supposed oppressors throughout their lives, and are as well represented as their supposed oppressors in the upper and middle classes. For the last few years, more women have gone to college than men. For slightly longer, more high-school valedictorians have been female. How does this justify giving them an admissions preference? It simply doesn't, except to someone determined to capitalize on gender guilt well past the point of mere equality. The more women get into elite colleges because of affirmative action, the fewer members of truly disadvantaged groups do so. As I've said before, the leadership (not the rank and file) of many women's groups consists of women who are doing just fine already, and their agenda is often at odds with equality.",

I agree with you on all points. I believe that a real man is a man who knows that being a man isn't always about being a badass or being stubborn. I believe that a real man is someone who although has power knows how and when to use it and when not to use it. You have to be humble. I think this is an important concept. Sadly, the reason young men are lacking this is b/c of their fathers or a lack of a father. I would stress a lack of a father. A father is a very important thing. Feminists have always tried to make sure women weren't treated as play things or less human but the way they look at men and husbands is that the mothers has more right to a child's life. For breeding purposes only. Men are very important expecially in the lives of their sons. Without a father you have to positive male role model to look up to. This can lead to a lot of problems including anger problems.",

   "Well, I'm sorry, but I was at work when I posted before and didn't even have my copy handy. Now I have it in front of me, and I can do a better job. From Myth of Male Power (Berkley paperback, 1994) on page 33 we find this:\n\n \n It still doesn`t show how this equates to financial control. It appears to me like it`s more about women being required and expected to take care of everyday household purchases...\n \n \nOn page 57 there's this, on another topic we've discussed.\n \n\n \n Those figures are almost 15 years old. Are they even relevant today considering the increased labour market participation rate among women?\n \n \nYes. you can have the oppurtunity to be a stay at home dad and you rightly should. Most men don't want that and look poorly on those who do. So it isn't very common. I was making a point that more women will take this option. We can expect all women to join the workforce. More men than women are cut out for that. I'm not making a sexist remark but that is just how we are made. \n\n \n That ought to depend on the job and how the labour market is construed as well as gender roles. There are huge country-specific difference in this regard. To claim that it`s a biological fact seems like a stretch considering the huge differences between countries we can observe. \n \n \n \nSome may take offense to that but men aren't as good at reading as women are so I mean we can't act like women can do everything a man can do. Some women can don't get me wrong but we are made different. Men can't do everything women can do. We complement each other so well when you think about it. \n\n \n Biologicly? A few things, like breastfeeding and carrying heavy things mayby, but not mch more... Society has shaped us into fulfilling certain roles though. AMking these roles optionable is very important if we are ever to achieve equality and emancipation from our own gender-structures.\n \n \n \nIf you read further I was saying this could be the fact but b/c we tell little girls that discrimination keeps them from pursuing what they want we just breed another generation of feminists that are pushing for more. Little girls have all the chance to succeed as little boys do. \n\n \n They have the same potential, yes. But not the same chance.\n \n \n \nWe need to focus on helping little boys learn. \n\n \n Agreed.\n \n \n \nBlasting men on TV and sterotyping is just making men fall into that sterotype. We need to teach young boys how to be a real man.\n\n \n What is a \"real man\"?\n \n \n \n I think people misjudge what equality is. This society seems to think its where everyone is equal. The statistics should show everyone is equal and if they don't we need to increase Affrimitive Action b/c their must be discrimination somewhere. This will not help fix anything. Equality means that you have an equal shot at achieving what you want. That doesn't mean for some it might be easier but if you set your heart and mind on something you can achieve it. \n\n \n Isn`t this a contradiction though? If everyone has an equal shot at achieving what you want, doesn`t that mean that everyone has an equal chance of success? That everyone has \"a shot\" or can theoreticly achieve anything is hardly equality. In that case, we had equality during the dark ages....\n \n \n \nYou have just reversed the roles and I don't care what the statistics say that is how it is in the real world. \n\n \n Ah, so you speak \"tha TruTH!1!!!?\"(tm) iregardless of what evidence say...\n \n \n \n You have made them feel as if they can hit a man do whatever they please and they can always be portrayed as the victim. I don't want to make light of those who really are victims, but women have the upper hand b/c unlike men women stay together they take up for each other they work together. Men on the other hand will turn on our best friend and let them do to us whatever they want b/c of what they have between their legs. In a sense that is pathetic.

If you want to discuss gender disparities in work both inside and outside the home, employment participation rates are barely even relevant.\n\n \n A rising employment of women as a percentage of male employment is certainly an indication of a narower gap in average weekly work hours between the sexes. \n \n But granted, average weekly work hours would be far more \"to the point\". But I don`t even know where to begin to look for those kind of numbers for the US. I do have the figures for Sweden based on AKU figures (official figures regarding employment), but the US government doesn`t seem to supply anything comparable availiable on the internet. I tried to navigate the U.S. Department of Labor but I couldn`t find anything \n \n And whenever I do a search on google, I only end up with nordic or swedish studies... Perhaps it`s my google search engine, or perhaps my use of words and phrases are a bit erm... swedish... but I even included the word \"USA\" and yet it refused to give me anything but seminars about the nordic model or country survey reports on Sweden :p (a slight exageration but pretty close to the truth.. ;) ). \n \n Finaly I found this study \n \n Work Schedules \n \n \"In 2000, average weekly work hours in the European Union were 36.7\n hours (40 hrs. for men, 32.5 hrs. for women, and 39.9 hrs. for full-time workers) (Boisard et al., 2003). Among different professional categories, managers had the highest average weekly hours at 44 hours per week. Comparable U.S. figures for 1999 (BLS, 2001) showed an average workweek of 38.4 hours (42 hrs. for men, 36 hrs. for women, and 42.7 hrs. for full-time workers), and 43.9 hours for managers.\"\n \n Peter Totterdell, \"Work Schedules\" p 37\n \n (my emphasize)\n \n Allthough this is perhaps not comparable as these figures are no doubt calculated as average weekly work hours among the employed, not the entire population. And I don`t think commuting time was included. However, I`m not certain how your figures from 1991 where calculated so I can`t say for sure. If these figures are comparable though, it would imply a dramatic shift as the difference would have shrunk to 8 hours in merely 10 years or so (a bit to big for me to believe that it is comparable though...).\n \n Perhaps one could combine these figures with the employment figures and we would get the average weekly work hours per capita between 16-65 years of age rather than per employed.\n \n This would yield a figure of 32,3 hours for males and 23,6 hours for women. Still a dramatic shift in the gap. Roughly 9 hours gap instead of 22 and even though this is excluding commuting time, it still looks like the gap is dramaticly different, perhaps too different...\n \n However, the gap shrunk from 9 hours to 6,8 hours in the same timeframe in Sweden. A (edit: 24) percent decrease. Not as dramatic, but still a significant change. And considering the initial gap was so much narrower in Sweden, the change in the US was perhaps not impossible... \n \n What do you think?\n \n Edit: Added comparison to Sweden.\n \n EditII: XXXX... we would probably need to correct for unemployment as well... I don`t think it would change much, but, but.. I can`t be arsed to do it tonight though.",
