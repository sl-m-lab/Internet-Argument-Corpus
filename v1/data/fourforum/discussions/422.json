   "I made the mistake of turning to MSNBC (I should have known better) and was greeted by a monstrous banner that read \"Democrats Unpatriotic\". It appears that Tom Daschle (spelling?) criticized Bush's decision, and was crucified on the spot as near-treasonous. I was just wondering what you guy's opinions were on whether or not what he did was unpatriotic, voicing his opinion in a democracy? how dare he. Maybe I missed something, but I've never heard \"impartial\" anchors give a man such a verbal beatdown before.\n \n I guess I'm just wondering, regardless of whether you believe in the war or not, if simply because it's imminent, that we should all just fall in line with the president?",

However, criticizing the Commander in Chief on the eve of war is most definitely disloyal, and a move should be made to censure this particularly despicable member of the U.S. Senate. \n \n His actions are clearly meant to undercut the Commander in Chief during a time of war. By taking this action, he is effectively allying himself with our most diplomatically strained partners, and Saddam Hussein himself. When we are just hours away from an invasion where our troops will be put in harms way, it is highly inappropriate to use such language, as it is meant to weaken the war effort. \n \n Putting himself in this role Daschle is not abiding by his oath to defend our constitution from foreign enemies, and thus paints himself as a domestic threat. If this language persists after troops are on the ground in Baghdad, he should be arrested under the 1918 Sedition Act, which was an amendment to the 1917 Espionage Act. In addition, he should then be expelled from Congress. \n \n Right now, since it is evident that his allegiance lies in the roots of Marxist ideology, he should be barred from access to any committees that have responsibility for the country's national security. Whatever happens, I am pretty sure this man has committed political suicide. Surely, he will lose his seat during the next election. What a disgraceful son of a bitch.",

   "You'll be happy to know that you are a raving lunatic who is apparently unaware of the speech and debate clause, who feels that the president should be able to be a dictator, who believes that every war any president undertakes has to be considered just, and who would prefer that dissenters do it quietly in a dark room somewhere.\n \n Saying a war shouldn't happen is not antipatriotic, its not allying ourselves with our enemies, and it sure as hell not treasonous. Its freaks such as you that keep me on the fence in a war I support on principle, b/c i hesistate to align myself with human beings with no respect for dissent and no love for the values we are supposedly protecting, among them right to differ from the government.\n \n Iraq has not presented itself yet as a foreign threat. It may well be in the future, but as to whether it is now, that is still up for debate. Whether the president has handled the situation correctly is certainly up for debate, and to ask that everyone fall lock step behind the president when every he deems it convienant is to suppress the very virtues of free speech that make our nation great.\n \n I can't BELIEVE you are actually defending the Sedition act. That was a blemish upon the virtues of this nation that I THOUGHT this country had unanimously rejected. Apparently some feel that the right to speak freely only extends to those who abide by the governmental position. That standard, however, is the first step to tyranny.\n \n Finally, your use of \"marxism\" crushes any shred of credibilty u have left. You, like many of the conservatives on that site, use words of that ilk (socialist, communist et al) to attack anything you dislike. It is fallacious, b/c you give no warrent for WHY a man who is attacking a war is in line with an ideology that favors violent revolution against oppression. It is not designed to be aligned with any truthfulness, but rather to elicit a defualt emotional response by people who don't know what marxism is but know that its left-wing and they dislike. You should be ashamed to resorting to such logical fallacies, and if you are going to make an argument, at least make a perfunctory effort at a logical one.",

   "I am well aware of the Schenk decision (upholding the sedition act). I suppose that because the court said that black's can't be citizens (scott v. sanford) you think that was ok until the passage of the 14th amednment? Or that Japanese internment was justified (korematsu v. US)? Or that from 1896-1953, segregation was ok (plessy v. ferguson)? The court saying something is true doesn't make it right, it just means they interpreted the constitution in a certain manner. I think that Justice Brandeis' opinion in the 1937 case of Whitney v. California (adopted to majority view in Brandenburg v. Ohio) is the constitutional guideline we should follow here anyway \"To courageous, self-reliant men, with confidence in the power of free and fearless reasoning applied through the processes of popular government, no danger flowing from speech can be deemed clear and present, unless the incidence of the evil apprehended is so imminent that it may befall before there is opportunity for full discussion. If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood andfallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.\" In that respect, Daschle's quote falls outside of the clear and present danger b/c 1) I fail to see how dissenting from majority opinion in a war is a \"clear\" danger, and 2) it isn't present b/c we are going to go to war anyway. What Norman really fails to recognize here is the fundamental right all of us have to protest against governmental actions we feel are tyrannical. Nor does he show how the action is not protected in the speech and debate clause.\n Lets look at Norman's logic and deconstruct it to find where it leads.\n 1) Daschle opposes govt. on war therefore he should not be allowed to be a senator\n ergo\n 2) People who oppose the govt. can't be part of the government\n ergo\n 3) government cannot be changed, and hello tyranny.\n \n Now to your attack on daschle as socialist. I have two responses: 1) being a socialist doesn't mean you have a vested interest in seeing the country fail. It means you think the country will be more successful in a socialist structure. Regardless the goal is improving the country, and you show no reason why daschle is so beholden to socialism that he wants it even if it causes failure.\n 2) not being blindly patriotic isn't socialism. key word: blindly. Daschle doesn't think we handled the situation correctly. He believes that our country acted wrongly. He may be right, he may be wrong, but expressing that opinion is THE HEIGHT of true patriotism, because it implies that he wants the govt. to act correctly and thus in a manner beneficial to the people. Whether he is right in his opinion is irrelevant, because patriotism is a sentiment, and daschle's sentiments are that we need to change our countries actions for it to be better. I often disagree with my nation's policies. Why don't I leave? Because I geniunely love america, and rather let it die in its own mistakes, I try and change it for the better. DISSENT IS TRUE PATRIOTISM. I'd be interested in how you equate an economic system that advocates governmental intervention in the economy w/ hating a country and wanting it to fail. Two very disparate ideas.\n \n Now to add to your list of people who should be exiled from govt....Don Rumsfeld for helping push through the sale of weapons to Iraq and seeking to open diplomatic relations with as they were using chemical weapons, a fact known to the state dept. and in fact the entire world at the time! http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=15&ItemID=2177\n But in case that doesn't persuade you, how about selling nuclear reactors to North Korea, the state who actually has nukes now that can hit us? Gee, wonder where they got the capabilities from?\n http://www.swissinfo.org/sen/Swissinfo.html?siteSect=41&sid=1648385\n \n Now, as to people harming homeland security, how about George W. Bush, for consistantly opposing 1st the creation of the homeland security department, then when that became politically unfeasible, delaying its creation by inserting in an unnecessary provision striping HS workers of union protection solely so he could draw democratic fire and then accuse them of being anti-security? Politically effective? yep, it resulted in the ouster of former Sen. Max Cleland, an original sponser of the homeland security bill (and triple amputee vietnam vet), by former rep. Saxby Chambliss, an original opponent of HS who accused cleland of being against security. Or if that doesn't persuade you, read the post \"democrats need to stop the lies\" in the politics forum on how bush was successful in stopping a bipartisan effort to increase hs in order to fund his tax cuts, cut funding on the agency responsible for international nuclear security so much that Sec. of Energy Spencer Abraham says that they can't defend against weapons grade nuclear material being stolen by terrorists, and is now conducting some of its vital operations on private donations. Read the article \"The 9/10 President\" In the March 10 2003 \"New Republic\" for more info.\n \n To conclude, I find your outrageous attitude in supressing dissent to morally abyssmal and repugnant to the very ideals our country was founded upon. Want another man to add to your definition of sedition? How about Thomas Paine, for giving aid and comfort to the enemies of england with his revolution inspiring words? The right to dissent is among our most cherished, and to paraphrase Voltaire \"I disagree with what you say, and will defend to the death your right to say it.\"\n Or if you prefer, my favorite quote of all time:\n \"If all of mankind, minus one, were of one opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one than he, if he had the power, would be in silencing mankind.\" -J.S. Mill, \"On Liberty\"",

   "I have not given up on this one. In fact, I have put some more thought into it, especially after Peter Arnett's treason. What he did was treason, just as it would be treason for Daschle to come out with a message similar to Arnett's, at this stage. If a key member of congress came out and complimented Iraq for there hindering the U.S. war plan, Al Jazeera and Iraqi T.V. would use it as a propaganda piece to strengthen the resolve of their people, resulting in an increased threat to our forces on the ground. In addition, it would be providing aid and comfort to the enemy. Notice, in my letter, I said if Daschle continues with such speech after the war begins. However, treason does not apply to ridiculing the president for his diplomacy. Even though it was a underhanded distgusting thing to do, he has the right to say what he did, at that time.\n \n The Sedition Act does not apply as it was repealed in 1921. What I said was stated in the heat of the moment, and was purely wishful thinking. Giving this subject further thought, I have come to a different conclusion about the utility of such a law. My previous position is now more in line with what I stated when I first mentioned it under a General Debate category that I started.\n \n In all seriousness, if you want to know how I feel about the matter of internal security, espionage, treason, sabotage, sedition, and dissent, I think you should read Harry S. Truman's 1950 Special Message to the Congress on the Internal Security of the United States.\n \n His piece resembles what I originally said when I first brought it up on these forums. I must admit that the Sedition Act wasn't the greatest piece of legislation as it was too broad, and created the type of chilling effect that concerns me on many different political levels.\n \n On the other hand, my patriotic views, and digust with people like Arnett does have the ability to send me into the type of hysteria that Truman warns about in his message. As I am more libertarian in nature than most of your average Americans, one must question the effect that one has when they display such transparent hatred for the United States. If I can become prone to this type of hysteria, how does one think the silent majority is reacting? How much longer do they suppose that they can attempt to undermine the ideals that bind this country together before they get a reaction?\n \n We should not bring back the Sedition Act, as I don't think it would be wise, gratifying yes. I can see the merits of the law, especially in the wake of this assault on our social fabric by liberals. However, if we react with such a broad sweeping broom will have have helped them to meet their objectives.\n \n In Iraq, we are currently tearing down the only state symbol that they really have. That being the image of Saddam Hussein. This is a tactic that is employed by invading forces, and revolutionaries. I submit that this has been occurring in our country for some time, in a more subversive manner. Perhaps those mouthpieces of utter insanity are trying to rile this nation into abandoning the very principles most important to the strength of our democracy. Such a response would only help them to tear down our national symbols. \n \n No, there are other (more appropriate) laws that can be applied to the subversive movement, and these are the laws that we should use. Anything less would be lazy and result in poor police work. Therefore, those smart enough to stay under the radar, would be given that much more of an advantage. Since the quality of our investigative work would also suffer out of a perceived lack of a need for hard work, we must not stifle the creativity of those agencies necessary for the internal security of this country. We don't need it, because much like Chinese imports it is too easy and it is too cheap. There is no substitute for the quality, and rigidness of the system we have created in America. \n \n A work of art\n \n This is one of the very few times that I have to admit that I may have had the wrong idea about something.

   "Ok, I am abit confused about what alternative you are providing for instead of the Sedition act, but I doubt you can reconcile it with Whitney so I doubt its constitutional. On to Arnett, what he said wasn't treason for a couple of reasons. One, he's from New Zealand, so he has no pledge of loyalty to the US. Two, what he said could be reasonably construed as the truth, the Iraqi forces have done a surprisingly good job of delaying what was expected to be a US blitzkrieg. I am a bit leery about censoring opinions in any event, but I DEFINITELY don't wish for the US to turn into a propoganda machine everytime we go to war. I'd gladly trade a little \"aid and comfort to the enemy\" for truthfulness in reporting. Otherwise, why bother having them? For a professed \"libertarian\" you certainly seem willing to give a hell of alot of power to the state (no selfrespecting libertarian could ever refer to the revival of anti-sedition laws as \"wishful thinking\").\n \n I still don't understand what ideals Arnett or Daschle are \"undermining.\" I always thought free speech was one of those ideals, and you certainly seem all to prepared to undermine that for the sake of a false sense of security. And as Benjamin Franklin once said \"Those who trade liberty for security deserve neither.\" (I paraphrase). You profess concern for the \"chilling effect\" on political speech the sedition act might have, but somehow, I'd bet that prosecuting reporters for treason due to reporting a piece with a negative view on how the war is turning out (from the american perspective) might have a bit of \"chill\" as well.\n \n Also, as a side note, you say the passage of the sedition act would \"fulfill the objectives of the liberals.\" But you say it is tempting to combat the efforts of liberals with the sedition act (or something like it). You seem to equate \"things that are bad\" with \"liberal,\" which is a) intellectually dishonest and b) just stupid. This is why, despite your occassional solid argumentation, I still don't particularly respect you, because you aren't willing to concede that people you dislike might have the right view on something, even if it is the same as your's. I would venture that the passage of the sedition act would not fulfill the liberals objectives, but rather confirm our worst fears.\n \n I'd be interested in how you reconcile free speech with your as yet unelaborated \"anti-sedition plan.\" You say it needs to be flexible, but if flexible means subjective, then count me out on it. Because you still haven't proven \"clear and present danger\" under the whitney standard, you havent met the burden imposed on those who wish to limit our freedoms, and until you do, you still lose (philosophically anyway).",

   "DSA,\n \n This may give you some indication about the type of measures I believe are necessary to sto the revolutionary iconoclasts that aim to destroy our national symbols for the purpose of revolution:\n \n Now, was I referring to a new Sedition Act when I suggested that vermin supporting anti-Americanism represent a problem that must be cleansed? No. I, like those on the left, propose we use the 1st amendment, but as a tool for the destruction of our enemies rather than the destruction of our country. An atmosphere has been created where enemies of the U.S. feel comfortable in vocalizing their perverted viewpoints. It is obvious that the views one espouses can be used as an indicator of where their loyalties lie. I would never suggest that we start locking people up for having a dissenting opinion, for I often hold unpopular views. However, a person's ideas can provide insight into the types of actions, or the activities that they may be engaged in. A criminal mind will more than likely lead to criminal activities. Once a person identifies themselves as an enemy of the United States, investigators can then try to charge them with the commission of whatever crimes they might be involved in. That is, if they happen to exist. By evaluating the speech coming from different segments of the population, you can then narrow the scope of the search and allocate law enforcement resources wisely. -as stated in We should use laws to rid ourselves of the anti-American Garbage\n \n Preexisting laws cover many of the activities that the anti-American left is engaged in. For instance:\n \n 18 USC Sec. 232 \n 1) The term ''civil disorder'' means any public disturbance involving acts of violence by assemblages of three or more persons, which causes an immediate danger of or results in damage or injury to the property or person of any other individual. \n \n 18 USC Sec. 231 \n (3) Whoever commits or attempts to commit any act to obstruct, impede, or interfere with any fireman or law enforcement officer lawfully engaged in the lawful performance of his official duties incident to and during the commission of a civil disorder which in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or adversely affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce or the conduct or performance of any federally protected function - Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. \n (b) Nothing contained in this section shall make unlawful any act of any law enforcement officer which is performed in the lawful performance of his official duties. \n \n 18 USC Sec. 2101\n (a) Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses any facility of interstate or foreign commerce, including, but not limited to, the mail, telegraph, telephone, radio, or television,with intent - \n (1) to incite a riot; or \n (2) to organize, promote, encourage, participate in, or carry on a riot; or \n (3) to commit any act of violence in furtherance of a riot; or \n (4) to aid or abet any person in inciting or participating in or carrying on a riot or committing any act of violence in furtherance of a riot; and who either during the course of any such travel or use or thereafter performs or attempts to perform any other overt act for any purpose specified in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) of this paragraph\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n No we do not need a wide reaching law that restricts free-speech. We need a Justice Department willing to enforce those laws that already cover the illegal activities that many of these groups are engaged in.",

   "ok, from what i gather your plan is to profile people based on the viewpoints they expressed (specifically, ones that make them \"enemies of america\"). Two problems:\n 1) its entirely subjective. You say that Daschle's speech makes him an enemy of America. I say it makes him a defender of American ideals. Which one of us is right? Why? and how do you draw the line? Its a subjective matter that cannot meet any objective standard. Thus, it falls to individual discretion, and that's a risk I'm unwilling to make.\n 2) It STILL has a chilling effect on speech, b/c it basically subjects a group of people to additional scrutiny based on the views they express. Its easy to imagine a scenario where an overzealous prosecuter starts arresting people left and right for treason b/c they spoke out against the prez in wartime. To say that people will be as willing to dissent when dissent means you go under the legal eye is fallacious.\n \n Also, you say that we can use existing federal laws to curb anti-american speech, such as civil disorder statutes. First, reading the law strictly, I dont think MANY (not to say all) of the left engage in such activities. If you are reading it losely, IE that a rally against war provides aid and comfort thus endangering troops lives, then you are misinterpreting the constitution. The constitution isn't valid only so far as it get's statutory authorization. Statutes are only valid to the extent that they comply with the constitution.

Bottom line, not all of our enemies are foreign, although I would not drop the racial profiling. I would just add another spectre to the ways and means with which we profile.\n For example, Stanley Cohen, a lawyer that represents Hamas, should be under investigation. It is obvious that he subscribes to an ideology as extreme as any Islamic fundamentalist's.",

   "Can someone say \"Strawman argument?\"\n \n Me: Investigating people merely because they say something that goes against the popular view has a chilling effect on speech.\n You: So you are saying we should never investigate anyone again?\n Me: No, that's absurd, and here's why:\n My argument was NOT \"the importance of preserving free speech is so important that we must never, ever, investigate anyone for fear of a chilling effect.\" I am saying that investigating someone SOLELY because of something they say, absent of any other proof or suspician, has a chilling effect. If someone says \"I dislike America,\" that isn't enough to open a file on them. If they say \"I dislike America\" and we have a tip that he is planning a bomb attack, then you can open the investigation.\n Once again, you convienantly provide me with an example of your own policy's potential for abuse. Stanley Cohen clearly does subscribe to radical ideology. It is one of two things\n 1) A love of money and limelight. Not great, but hey, you say you like capitalism right?\n 2) I deep deep commitment to....fundamentalist islam? no a deep commitment to the 6th amendment right to an attorney. Being a lawyer for Hamas makes you no more worthy of suspician than being a criminal defense attorney makes one accomplice to murder. I think that Cohen is a perfect example of how your system doesn't hold, because his association with a radical group does not in any way denote a support for its actions. If anything, it denotes a support for the ideals I outline in 1 and 2.\n Finally, the supreme court has stated this about our criminal justice system \"Our system is accusatorial, not inquistorial.\" We don't assume people are guilty and hold files on them until proven otherwise. We assume they are innocent until we get some proof of them DOING AN ILLEGAL ACT, not doing something which makes them part of a subset which has a greater propensity for an illegal act. To do otherwise violates the guarentee of due process enshrined by our constitution.\n So to review, you don't think that the basic guarentees of due process and right to attorney are important\n ERGO\n You dislike two of the most important American values\n ERGO\n you are asking that we eliminate/severely curtail these values\n ERGO\n you are against our current governmental system\n ERGO\n under your own system, you should be investigated as a possible terror suspect (since you hate the freedoms we possess)\n \n Oh, yes, btw. You have STILL yet to provide a constitutional justification for your system under the Whitney standard (good luck)",
