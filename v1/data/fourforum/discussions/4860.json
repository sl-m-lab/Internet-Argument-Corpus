   "No doubt, it has been done much by the governments of the states that enter into the antiterroristic coalition in the matter of B/C and nuclear weapons non-proliferation. Still, I don't think that was really enough. The threat to peace remains in the world.\n \n I think the antiterroristic coalition should intensify its efforts. It should not come to half measures and also should avoid dual standard. For instance, if it is said that North Korea has nuclear weapons and it should get deprived of it, why not first check, say, Israel, India and Pakistan, that are much more developed in this field. And what about the very U.S.? As I understand, they are not much willing to refuse its nuclear weapons. Otherwise it will no longer stay a superstate and will lose a major part of its influence. Why don't anybody say that the U.S. threatens the world with its weapons of mass destruction? Why does not the world unite in the face of stars and stripes menace?...",

'Dirty' weapons deployed already in Iraq and Kuwait caused no such backlash, despite the fact that US troops on the ground have also suffered the effects of spent DU rounds.\n \n The real threat to the world is the next empire builder. Empires have risen and fallen before, but the damage caused in the process has grown beyond measure.I fear that the next great man who seeks to blanket the world in his ideology may accidentally smother it.",
