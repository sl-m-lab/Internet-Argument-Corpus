Each municipality can elect a certain number of representatives which are usually chosen from certain religious groups.

We made a big push to get Iraqis on the international scene to vote because we felt they were more likely to side with the US and vote for \"our guys\". Most of the iraqi expats who voted had not been to iraq in years, and will likely never return. Also, if you look at the nations where we set up Iraqi voting, it speaks volumes. The largest base fo Iraqi expats are in Iran. I did not see news reportsa about the Iraqi expats in IRan casting ballots, though the Iranians would probably have even footed the bill for that one.",

The war was a direct result of outsiders trying to influence the way things ran in Lebanon.\n The people don't ever want a repeat of what happened, so apart from the UN they want nothing to do with outside influence, be it American, Syrian or otherwise.\n Naturally this is easier said than done considering that Syria and Iran still have close ties to Hezbollah, but slowly progress is being made.\n Despite what is said in the media, the leader of Hezbollah is actually considered to be a moderate by many people, including the Christians.",
