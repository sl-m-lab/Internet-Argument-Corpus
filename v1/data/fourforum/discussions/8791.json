   "I've always suspected them to be just treacherous beasts. How do you like that much boasted \"peaceful project USA-France\"? I got a big chuckle out of it. 200 military constructors (!) is French contribution into cause of peace in the Middle East. They are kidding us! And they are just exploiting us! American participation in the project is meant by France only to make it look weighty. \n Methinks France's hidden agenda here is restoring its lost positions in Lebanon. And her secret talks with the Cyprus over French military base there also fit the plan well. I feel wily French are set to keep an eye over all Eastern Mediterranean out from there and not only Lebanon. Does it suit \"Broader Middle East\" doctrine worked out by our joint effort with Britain? In no way I guess. It's a challenge to it actually. \n \n But they've already dragged us into that trap! And UN resolutions are going to be their most efficient tool to keep us there. In more distant future France's cherished idea is the Middle East as EU domain with France on the throne.\n How could this big gaffe of our State Dep. happen? It was just seduced by France. Frankly, I've got no clue. Could they be lobby or something like that?",
