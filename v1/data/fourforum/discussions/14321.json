   "The federal regulator for Offshore drilling was systematically weakened under Bush's Presidency:-\n \nMMS under Bush admin. loosened regulation of drilling, downplayed risk, ignored safety warnings\n \n MMS adopted regulation stating drillers are \"in the best position to determine the environmental effects of its proposed activity.\" The Washington Post reported on May 25 that the actions taken by the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service, the agency that regulates offshore drilling, \"are shaped in part by a 2005 regulation it adopted that assumes oil and gas companies can best evaluate the environmental effects of their operations.\" The article stated that \"[t]he rule governing which information the MMS should receive and review before signing off on drilling plans states: 'The lessee or operator is in the best position to determine the environmental effects of its proposed activity based on whether the operation is routine or non-routine.'\" Rolling Stone magazine reported that these \"new rules\" \"pre-qualified deep-sea drillers\" to receive an \"exemption from environmental review,\" even though such exemptions were \"originally intended to prevent minor projects, like outhouses on hiking trails, from being tied up in red tape.\"\n \n In April 2008, MMS loosened rules requiring blowout plan. The Associated Press reported on May 5 that \"A rule change two years ago by the federal agency that regulates offshore oil rigs allowed BP to avoid filing a plan specifically for handling a major spill from an uncontrolled blowout at its Deepwater Horizon project.\" AP further reported: \"The MMS rule change, made in April 2008, says that Gulf rig operators are required to file a blowout scenario only if one of five conditions applies. For example, an operator must provide a blowout scenario when it proposes to install a 'surface facility' in water deeper than 1,312 feet. While Deepwater Horizon was operating almost 5,000 feet below the surface, [BP spokesman William] Salvin said the project did not meet the definition of a surface facility. The MMS official agreed.\"\n \n MMS 2007 environmental impact assessment for BP lease dismissed risk of massive oil spill. The Washington Post reported on May 5: \"While the MMS assessed the environmental impact of drilling in the central and western Gulf of Mexico on three occasions in 2007 -- including a specific evaluation of BP's Lease 206 at Deepwater Horizon -- in each case it played down the prospect of a major blowout.\" The Post stated that \"In one assessment, the agency estimated that 'a large oil spill' from a platform would not exceed a total of 1,500 barrels and that a 'deepwater spill,' occurring 'offshore of the inner Continental shelf,' would not reach the coast. In another assessment, it defined the most likely large spill as totaling 4,600 barrels and forecast that it would largely dissipate within 10 days and would be unlikely to make landfall.\" According to the Times-Picayune, these assessments \"paved the way for BP to assert that its plans for drilling in Lease Sale 206 posed no real dangers\": \n \n Before the lease of the oilfields in 2008, the MMS wrote a generic Environmental Impact Statement for the entire northern and western Gulf of Mexico that made the catastrophic well blowout that happened April 20 seem like a near impossibility.\n \n MMS produced its blanket Environmental Impact Statement for 11 proposed leases, mostly off the Louisiana and Texas coasts. One of those planned sales was Lease Sale 206, which gave BP the right to drill at what is known as Mississippi Canyon 252 with a Transocean oil rig called Deepwater Horizon.\n \n The MMS assessed everything from the possible impact of noise on marine life to the specific vulnerabilities of sea turtles and sturgeon, but through it all, the agency assumed any oil that might be spilled would be minimal and any leak would be quickly shut off.\n \n The document states that small oil spills and leaks from pipelines and ships are relatively common and have little effect on the environment. In fact, thousands of natural seeps in the sea floor combine to pump much more oil into the Gulf of Mexico each year than the current manmade leak has produced, but they are spread all over the sea in amounts that quickly dissipate, according to the study.\n \n When it comes to the type of oil well blowout that happened April 20, MMS was downright dismissive. The agency determined that fewer than six of every 10,000 wells would have a blowout that caused any oil to spill. Blowouts are \"rare events of short duration,\" the study stated, and \"the infrequent subsurface blowout that may occur on the Gulf OCS (Outer Continental Shelf) would have a negligible effect on commercial fishing.\"\n \n That paved the way for BP to assert that its plans for drilling in Lease Sale 206 posed no real dangers. \n MMS failed to respond to 2004 warning about vital piece of blowout preventer. The Wall Street Journal reported on May 3 that \"[f]ederal regulators learned in a 2004 study that a vital piece of oil-drilling safety equipment may not function in deep-water seas but did nothing to bolster industry requirements. The equipment, called shear rams, is supposed to seal off out-of-control oil and gas wells by pinching the pipe closed and cutting it.\" The Journal further reported that \"[e]xperts theorize the rams may have failed to work as expected in the Deepwater Horizon disaster.\"\n \n MMS ignored warnings about faulty cementing in wells. The Associated Press reported on May 24 that numerous MMS reports identified \"poor cement job\" as the cause of offshore accidents, including incidents that took place in 2005 and 2007, \"[y]et federal regulators give drillers a free hand in this crucial safety step.\" AP noted that rig owner Transocean and \"independent experts\" have pointed to \"faulty cement work\" as a possible cause of the blowout, and that new rules \"in the works long before the Deepwater Horizon\" took effect June 3, which \"take a conservative watch-and-wait approach and demand only routines already carried out around the industry: a management program with monitoring and diagnostic testing.\"\n \n \"WSJ: In 2003, MMS decided not to require last-resort shut-off device. ABC News reported on April 30 that in 2000 MMS \"issued a safety alert that called added layers of backup 'an essential component of a deepwater drilling system.'\" However, according to the Wall Street Journal, \"The industry argued against\" mandating a remote-control shut-off switch that serves as \"last-resort protection against underwater spills,\" and \"[b]y 2003, U.S. regulators decided remote-controlled safeguards needed more study. A report commissioned by the Minerals Management Service said 'acoustic systems are not recommended because they tend to be very costly.'\" The Journal noted that the Deepwater Horizon rig did not have a remote-control device, which is required \"in two major oil-producing countries, Norway and Brazil,\" and that \"[i]ndustry consultants and petroleum engineers said that an acoustic remote-control may have been able to stop the well, but too much is still unknown about the accident to say that with certainty.\"\n \n NPR similarly reported that Michael Saucier, MMS regional director in New Orleans, said at a hearing, \"I think it was around 2001, there were some draft rules concerning secondary control systems for BOP stacks, and those rules were then sent up to headquarters to continue through the process.\" The NPR report goes on to state, \"But what came back from headquarters were not rules, he said, just notices that 'highly encouraged' companies to use the backup systems. 'There is no enforcement on it,' he said.\"\n \n MMS reportedly suppressed scientists' concerns about environmental impact of spills in Alaska. A June 6 Denver Post article reported that an MMS office in Alaska rejected a 2006 analysis conducted by a biologist, which stated that a large oil spill could significantly harm fish populations. The analysis, which would have \"required MMS to conduct a more detailed environmental impact statement before auctioning leases in the Beaufort Sea,\" was rewritten after a supervisor told the biologist that his analysis would cause a \"delay in sale 202. That would, as you can imagine, not go over well with HQ and others.\" The Denver Post further reported, \"Concerns raised by another MMS biologist, James Wilder, that the impact on polar bears was not adequately addressed in Shell's Alaska exploration plan, also were rebuffed, according to e-mails.\"\n \n Inspector General reports detail MMS ethics violations during Bush admin.\n \n Inspector General found \"a culture where the acceptance of gifts from oil and gas companies were widespread\" in Louisiana MMS office. The Department of Interior's Office of Inspector General (OIG) investigated allegations against MMS employees for conduct that \"occurred prior to 2007\" in the Lake Charles, Louisiana, district, and \"found a culture where the acceptance of gifts from oil and gas companies were widespread throughout that office,\" and that prior to 2007, \"receiving gifts such as hunting trips, fishing trips, and meals from oil companies appears to have been a generally accepted practice by MMS inspectors and supervisors in the Gulf of Mexico region.\" MMS subsequently \"provid[ed] additional ethics training to employees.\"\n \n IG investigation found email porn, illegal drug use at Louisiana MMS office. The Lake Charles investigation also found that -- in addition to accepting gifts from oil companies-- MMS employees \"admitted to using illegal drugs during their employment at MMS,\" including a clerical worker who said \"he had used crystal methamphetamine the night prior to coming to work at MMS,\" and an inspector who \"admitted that he might have been under the influence of the drug at work after using it the day before.\" Moreover, while reviewing MMS employees' email accounts \"from 2005 to 2009,\" the OIG found \"numerous instances of pornography and other inappropriate material on the e-mail accounts of 13 employees, six of whom have resigned.\"\n \n IG: MMS employee negotiated a job with drilling company while inspecting their platforms. The IG report states that a Lake Charles MMS employee, who now works for the Island Operating Company, an oil and gas production firm, negotiated a job with the company while inspecting IOC platforms. \n \n Source told OIG that some MMS inspectors allowed oil and gas companies to fill out their own inspection forms. From the May 24 report on the Lake Charles MMS office:\n \n Another confidential source told investigators that some MMS inspectors had allowed oil and gas production company personnel located on the platform to fill out inspection forms. The forms would then be completed or signed by the inspector and turned in for review. According to the source, operating company personnel completed the inspection forms using pencils, and MMS inspectors would write on top of the pencil in ink and turn in the completed form.\n \n We reviewed a total of 556 files to look for any alteration of pencil and ink markings, notations, or signatures. We found a small number with pencil and ink variations; however, we could not discern if any fraudulent alterations were present on these forms.\n Inspector General: \"Culture of ethical failure\" at Colorado MMS office. The Office of Inspector General also issued a report on September 9, 2008 stating that several investigations uncovered a \"culture of ethical failure\" at the Lakewood, Colorado MMS office. The report stated that \"between 2002 and 2006, nearly 1/3 of the entire RIK [Royalties In Kind] staff socialized with, and received a wide array of gifts and gratuities from, oil and gas companies with whom RIK was conducting official business.\" In addition, the investigation found a \"culture of substance abuse and promiscuity in the RIK program - both within the program... and in consort with industry. Internally, several staff admitted to illegal drug use as well as illicit sexual encounters.\" The report further stated:\n",

   "(from another blog) Was the explosion, fire, and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon an accident compounded by insufficient safeguards or was it something more conspiratorial? There is some growing suspicion, that, given the nature of the Obama administration, this would be an event that serves his agenda well. Obama&#8217;s agenda: \n \n * Promote third world interests at the expense of the US.\n * Promote global environmentalism over energy independence.\n * Promote middle east Islamic interests over US interests\n * Weaken the US economy to strengthen centralized government, control, and power.\n \n Some speculation revolves around environmental extremists trying to make a point. Others suggest a &#8220;black ops&#8221; mission sponsored by White House insiders. Among the several hundred workers on the platform, is it possible it could have been an &#8220;inside job?&#8221; Or was there a highly trained team of outsiders who might have triggered the event?\n \n I am not a &#8220;conspiracy theorist&#8221; by any stretch. I do not believe 9-11 was an &#8220;inside job.&#8221; And I hate to even consider that people inside our government would plot such a thing. Obama is a different case, however. He has demonstrated his eagerness to undo America in so many ways on so many levels. &#8220;Audacity&#8221; in his remaking of America in his third-world image is an understatement. And I am not the only one thinking this.\n \n Mr. Obama said SWAT teams were being dispatched to the Gulf to investigate oil rigs and said his administration is now working to determine the cause of the disaster. Huh? What do SWAT teams know about investigating oil rigs?\n \n What was the concern of the White House if the destruction of the Deepwater Horizon oil platform was caused only an industrial technical failure or negligence in the conversion from a drilling rig to a production pipeline that required SWAT teams to be sent to the Gulf to guard other oil platforms?",

Meanwhile, thinking people are trying to stop the disaster and prevent a future disaster. \n \n \nAnd no, I do not hold that North Korea hit the well....but it's on several blogs and no one has bothered to negate it....\n\n If I said that there was a giant space monster living behind Neptune that occasionally hurled asteroids at us, would you take the time to refute it? After all, we know that asteroids fly towards earth, and sometimes hit us, right? Or perhaps would you realize that it is so rediculous there is really no point in wasting your time on such a subject. Exactly. \n \n \nAnd that moratorium....trying to cover their XXX before it gets kicked again.....at the expense of those hard working families those oil rigs support ....\n\n Or, continue drilling without taking the time to investigate what happened, and without making sure that we are doing everything possible to prevent another disaster of this proportion, and risk filling the gulf with 2x the amount of oil...at the expense of those hard working fisherman, hotel and restaraunt owners, and everyone else that the gulf and it's tourism support. \n \n Try to look at this objectively. I get the distinct feeling that if this had happened while W was in office, you would have gone along with anything he said. You have shown at every turn that you oppose everything that Obama does.

Thus essentially, every dollar the government has not printed for itself, is taken from those creating wealth, whether it be private citizens or corporate businessmen. Thus with these astronomical sums of money in the budget it is a literal mind boggling adventure to presume to set a 'budget' (which the Democrats have not done by the way).\n \n Bill Clinton raised taxes more than any president in history before him but had the luck of the dot.com explosion and the resulting pathological capital investments in worthless dot.com paper which created a budget surplus.

   "Raising taxes does NOT spur growth. It does not spur investment upon which a capitalistic economy is based. This has been proven time and again. \nYet irrelevant to balancing the budget. Lowering taxes right now would not spur economic growth...it would only increase the budget deficit. Again, you saw the numbers...show be how that is not possible. The only way out is higher taxes and lower spending, PERIOD. I haven't heard a realistic argument otherwise. I give Paul Ryan credit for a plan but it isn't realistic unless it literally becomes an amendment. You can project 60 years. We'd all be dead before the budget was balanced. \n \n \nraising taxes actually reduces the amount of government revenue from taxes.\nThis isn't true. Obviously going from 0% to 1% taxes would increase revenue from taxes. Likewise 100% would get you nothing but 99% would probably yield something (really really small). That's the whole \"laffer\" curve. Recent data shows the peak to be around 60-65% tax rate but that doesn't really account for a down economy. Bush's tax cuts yielded less revenue for the government...this is a good example of why you don't just go with a theory because someone who is a \"conservative\" said so (not shown in your link).\n \n Actually, now that we are on the subject, I want to point out something to you from that link to Heritage. They talk about the tax cuts in the 1920s and how revenue went up in terms of real dollars. You need to keep in mind that the US economy was not stagnant in the 1920s. This is one of the few cases I feel percentage of GDP is good to use for comparison. Naturally if GDP doubles you would think tax revenue would double or close to double. In the 1920s between 1921 and 1928 the tax revenue as a percentage of GDP went down. So you could look at it as if tax revenue went down in comparison to what it could have been. Now you get into a chicken/egg argument. Did the tax rates being lower cause the economy to grow or was the economy growing on its own thus raising the tax revenue despite the tax cuts. I'd guess the later because in the 90s the tax rate jumped and revenue increased (aka the opposite of the 20s) on a total basis and % of GDP basis. Hard to say for sure though. I personally think the government shouldn't care...they should say they want to do \"x\" and raise the revenue accordingly.\n \n \nOf course we spent it! There has never been a SS 'fund'. The SS 'donations' immediately become part of the general operating fund, its just smoke and mirrors and makes taxes seem lower than they really are.\nit doesn't \"become\" part of the general operating fund...SSA \"invests\" it in t-bills. It is debt just like from China. This is an important distinction because if you had just given up the money than it wouldn't look so bad if you didn't pay it back.\n \n \nI would think that's a no-brainer, except for liberals a-la-euro who think that the government owes them birth to death subsidization. Trust me, we will be going down that same road soon with Barry Bambi.

   "Yet irrelevant to balancing the budget. Lowering taxes right now would not spur economic growth...it would only increase the budget deficit. Again, you saw the numbers...show be how that is not possible. The only way out is higher taxes and lower spending, PERIOD. I haven't heard a realistic argument otherwise. I give Paul Ryan credit for a plan but it isn't realistic unless it literally becomes an amendment. You can project 60 years. We'd all be dead before the budget was balanced. \n \n This isn't true. Obviously going from 0% to 1% taxes would increase revenue from taxes. Likewise 100% would get you nothing but 99% would probably yield something (really really small). That's the whole \"laffer\" curve. Recent data shows the peak to be around 60-65% tax rate but that doesn't really account for a down economy. Bush's tax cuts yielded less revenue for the government...this is a good example of why you don't just go with a theory because someone who is a \"conservative\" said so (not shown in your link).\n \n Actually, now that we are on the subject, I want to point out something to you from that link to Heritage. They talk about the tax cuts in the 1920s and how revenue went up in terms of real dollars. You need to keep in mind that the US economy was not stagnant in the 1920s. This is one of the few cases I feel percentage of GDP is good to use for comparison. Naturally if GDP doubles you would think tax revenue would double or close to double. In the 1920s between 1921 and 1928 the tax revenue as a percentage of GDP went down. So you could look at it as if tax revenue went down in comparison to what it could have been. Now you get into a chicken/egg argument. Did the tax rates being lower cause the economy to grow or was the economy growing on its own thus raising the tax revenue despite the tax cuts. I'd guess the later because in the 90s the tax rate jumped and revenue increased (aka the opposite of the 20s) on a total basis and % of GDP basis. Hard to say for sure though. I personally think the government shouldn't care...they should say they want to do \"x\" and raise the revenue accordingly.\n \n it doesn't \"become\" part of the general operating fund...SSA \"invests\" it in t-bills. It is debt just like from China. This is an important distinction because if you had just given up the money than it wouldn't look so bad if you didn't pay it back.\n \n I don't see much use anymore bashing up liberals or europe or Obama...it makes you less objective and unwilling to look at options in my opinion. A good example is my argument on tax hikes. Maybe republicans hear \"tax hike\" and knee jerk the word \"liberal\". You can't do this. I hear \"tax hike\" and I ask \"why?\". The financial statements tell me \"tax hike\" is needed because there is just no other way to put us on a path of sustainability....we passed the window to do it with just spending cuts. This is a much more conservative approach than automatically going for lower taxes and running up budget deficits.\n\n \n Why 'balance' the budget anyway? When one has a 13 trillion deficit, it's likely past the point of sustainability. When the government raises taxes, it never fails to turn around and spend more. Never fails.\n \n Whether SS is put into t bills or other, Congress, and the Budget Office, in general look at the funds as in the general fund and use them as such. \n \n When did being 'factual', and realistic, about liberals, European socialism, or Obama become 'bashing'? I simply feel that there is nothing new under the sun with regards to expenditures and taxation. Your options have been argued before. Would they work? I don't know, on paper it's a good argument, but it's been tried before. Liberals (and I'm not suggesting that you are one)make a big point of Bill Clinton's 'surplus' when he left office, and how the revenue started rolling in after he raised taxes, but as I noted, the dot.com's were the single forcing mechanism of that huge revenue. Of course, if in theory you go from 0 to 1% you generate more revenue, but that has proven in the past to be a temporary mechanism as the negative impact of the tax increase begins to affect the economic variables and revenue starts to nose-dive.\n \n If it's a tax increase, why don't the Dem's go ahead with it, they've passed everything else over the Republican objections.",

This is my suggestion that will work but you probably can do it in other ways.\n \n I too propose a gradual method of reducing government spending and involvement but would compensate this with tax increases to balance the budget sooner. \n [*]Repeal health care bill just passed (duh) - No one disagrees with this[*]raise eligibility age for Medicare and SS[*]disallow SS and Medicare for those with a net worth over a certain amount (millions..aka the top 5-10% in that age range)[*]Combine or eliminate several departments over a 10 year period (examples in Note A)[*]Cut DoD budget but 20% immediately with a gradual reduction over 10 years equal to 50% of current levels. This requires ending Iraq and Afghanistan as well as many bases. Reposition troops to protect out own country (aka Mexican border)[*]Cut remaining departments by 10-20% immediately with gradual increases to 30-40% over 10 years. Do this by eliminating positions, services, etc.[*]End federal pension program for their employees. Replace with something like a 401k[*]Immediately raise the top tax bracket to 55% and the 2nd highest to 40%...have it adjust each year so that deficits are no more than 10% of the budget for the first 5 years and 0% after that[*]Restructure tax system to eliminate virtually all exceptions and just have different standard deductions[*]Restructure corporate tax system to something that avoids tax shelters. Reduce tax rate on small to medium sized corporations. This tax rate would also adjust according to budget needs so in 10 years it should reduce as our government shrinks.[*]Reconsider numerous regulations and whether or not they are efficient or needed. These include things for Medicare/Medicaid to our friendly inspections of BP oil wells.[*]Pass a balanced budget amendment mandating a balanced budget except in war times plus allowable deficits up to 10% for up to five years during a recession.\n Hmm, I probably missed a few things...it is a little early in the morning on a Saturday. Basically the result of this would be a shock and probable depression for five years followed by a sustainable growth. Many people would just be forced into retirement which would be ok but that pension is gonna kill the budget. Many others would be laid off which would increase unemployment. I'm telling you...my plan would be like scrapping out an infected wound with no pain killers. The thing is, you have clean it out so it will heal.

What effect if any will they have on the deficit?\n Well you don't address many things I've said either.

   "Originally Posted by marc9000 \n What other line items? Why couldn't the retirement age be raised independent of everything else that's going on? \n\n \n \n \nYou can..but what is the reasoning for doing this? \n\n \n There's a limited, defined number of years that anyone can draw from SS before they exhaust all that they paid in throughout their working career. After that, they're living off the work of others - wealth is being redistributed. As life expectancy goes up, the problem worsens. It only makes sense that the retirement age should keep up with changing life expectancy statistics. Some things make sense without even having to look at economic charts and graphs. \n \n \n If it is to balance the budget than raising the retirement age really won't do enough. \n\n \n Why is it that if it doesn't do enough, then it shouldn't be done at all? Doesn't every little bit help? \n \n \n In fact, raising the retirement age plus slashing most departments 40%+ would STILL run you a deficit. I mean I posted the link to the US financial statements. Show me where I am wrong. \n\n \n \"US financial statements\" are about as confusing, controversial, political as projections of economic conditions years from now. The bottom line is that the US government spends more than it takes in. Undoing that problem isn't about math, it's about US founding principles and morality. \n \n \nSays who? This is ignorant thinking. \n\n \n If you say that taxes should be raised, you're saying that taxes aren't currently high enough. That is not conservative, it is anti-conservative. Raising taxes opposes the basic spirit of conservatism - the freedom to work hard, be creative, and get ahead in life. Higher taxation never enhances conservatism, never. It discourages risk taking, and diminishes the freedom and flexibility of American workers. \n \n \nI'm all ears to hear a different way (from cutting spending AND raising taxes).\n\n \n Cutting spending only, and leaving taxes alone. I'm not saying taxes should be cut, that always brings still more political division, and often smells of special interest and corruption. They should be frozen where they are for a period of years (5 years?) with a 4/5 majority vote of congress required to raise them in that time for some unforeseen circumstance. Same with EPA regulations, frozen where they are for 5 years, 4/5 congressional vote to change it. Then businesses small and large, would actually be able to make plans and take risks without fear of being completely ruined by some new government whim. That would also encourage more long-term, productive businesses to start up rather than \"fast buck\" businesses. I think an increase in easy-in, easy-out entertainment business has been a factor in the US economic downturn of the past several decades. To further explain what I mean, I'll reference you to another thread I started on that 2 years ago that got no responses. Did you notice that thread? Comment on that here or there - we build far more gambling casinos than we do oil refineries. Is the tax money that a business sends to the federal government all that matters, or does it go deeper than that?",

Our estimate is that the annual fiscal costs in 2010 would increase by nearly 70 percent to $61.5 billion for just these same three program areas. The amount would swell by an additional nearly 73 percent to $106.3 billion by 2020. \n",

The kind of games that have/had many people believing that Bill Clinton paid off the national debt in the 1990&#8217;s. Or &#8220;budget surpluses&#8221;, that are actually increases in debt, just not as high of increases as were originally projected. \nNo financial report showed Clinton paid off the national debt in the 1990s. The FY99 statements showed a surplus for the year but that is all in how you report the numbers and in a way the financial statements might be the best way to show it for our purposes. Anyway, it isn't a game...financial reports have to comply with GAAP and while the federal government gets some special treatment it doesn't materially alter the big picture. \n \n \nIt's too late to balance the budget all at once. Steps have to be taken, and results evaluated along the way. \nWell the solution to that isn't to make it happen in 70 years like Paul Ryan's plan. This seems to be what you are getting at as well. Even my plan probably wouldn't balance the budget right away...but it would make the government sustainable in the long run. \n \n \nIf you think conservatism is about raising taxes in any case, that's just something we have to agree to disagree on. The US has had a balanced budget in the past, and it had it with far fewer taxes than we have now. \nLet's see...we had a \"balanced\" budget in FY99 where taxes were higher. We had a \"balanced\" budget in 1957 where the top tax rate was in the 80+% range, in fact tax revenue as a percent of GDP was slightly higher on average in the mid 1900s to 2000 than it is today. \n \n In short, I don't think you are right. I'm all about low government low taxes but the truth is we chose high government high taxes for a long time and then took away the high taxes. You can do the lower government part but you'd have to cut so much it would be unrealistic as I have clearly shown. You can phase that in but it will take too much time with the national debt going way to high. Taxing gets you there faster and safer.\n \n \nYour cutting departments combined with higher taxes is more likely to cause a revolt in the streets than only cutting departments without changing taxation. \nYeah, I'm sure people will be sooo upset that the rich are getting taxed more over having their jobs cut out completely and their kids home since schools closed. \n \n \nWe're not going to get money from them if they take their ball and go home, and many/most of them can afford to do just that. It's the reason extreme socialism and communism don't work well. \nNice in theory but it turns out this just doesn't happen. Either way, I don't see another viable option.\n \n \nThe US is the policeman of the world. It's unfortunate, but it's reality. \nAnd how is that working out? Not well.\n \n \nBy &#8220;financial mess&#8221;, I mean spending at unsustainable levels. It has everything to do with raising taxes. A government with a constant appetite to raise taxes is exactly like a low-income person with a wallet full of credit cards. \nThere is no correlation between raising taxes and unsustainable spending levels. In fact, the biggest deficit increases have come during times of tax cuts under Reagan and Bush. I don't think they are totally to blame though.\n \n \nFrom the first line of your definition;\n &#8220;Limit change&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;leave it alone&#8221;, pretty close, don&#8217;t you think?\nNope. Clearly I think even you want change...change in spending levels.\n \n \nCould you make more understandable than the financial statements above? :)\nNope! Accountants get it....perhaps this should be a sign, if you don't get it perhaps it's time to leave it to the experts (not economists....they suck).\n \n \nMy plan would be to find the financial statements for the most recent year (whenever that was) when the US actually had a balanced budget. And find out how much lower taxes were then, how much less income the US government had then, and make todays expenditures similarly proportional to today's government income.\nOh, I thought my comment was funny...I criticized your plan than asked you what it was hehe.\n \n Anyway, the answer to your question is FY99. http://www.gao.gov/financial/fy99cfs.pdf\n \n Income tax rates were higher than they are today. Total revenue as a % of GDP was higher then. Spending was pretty low though (as a % of GDP which may not be the best figure). A lot of the difference was military spending and benefit reductions on welfare. \n \n Time to cut the spending and raise the taxes...there is no other way and from the looks of it, you can't show any different. Frankly, I think it is unfair and against everything I want (low government low taxes) but I've learned over the years that you can't force what you want on what reality is. The reality is that there is no other way. Once you fix the problem than you can get back to a low tax low government state...and believe it or not it would take much less time than you think.\n \n It's like a diet...you gotta cut calories AND exercise :)",

We've got to cut spending or increase revenues or do some combination of that.\" \n \n Guess after reviewing the numbers they are starting to see the writing on the wall. Looks like combination of the two is the best answer. The article goes on to talk about republicans being opposed to tax increases. Sorry guys, too late for that. There is NO other way.",

   "\n No financial report showed Clinton paid off the national debt in the 1990s. The FY99 statements showed a surplus for the year but that is all in how you report the numbers and in a way the financial statements might be the best way to show it for our purposes. Anyway, it isn't a game...financial reports have to comply with GAAP and while the federal government gets some special treatment it doesn't materially alter the big picture. \n\n \n It's the news media that materially alters the big picture. ;) \n \n \nWell the solution to that isn't to make it happen in 70 years like Paul Ryan's plan. This seems to be what you are getting at as well. Even my plan probably wouldn't balance the budget right away...but it would make the government sustainable in the long run. \n\n \n You and I both know that nothing will be done with things as they currently are - it will take a much bigger disaster to happen than what we're seeing today. \n \n \nLet's see...we had a \"balanced\" budget in FY99 where taxes were higher. We had a \"balanced\" budget in 1957 where the top tax rate was in the 80+% range, in fact tax revenue as a percent of GDP was slightly higher on average in the mid 1900s to 2000 than it is today. \n\n \n Are you referring to only income tax, or all taxes? Does the GDP include \"production\" from ambulance chasing law firms? Insurance company profits? Gambling casino profits? Pharmaceuticals? \n \n \nIn short, I don't think you are right. I'm all about low government low taxes but the truth is we chose high government high taxes for a long time and then took away the high taxes. You can do the lower government part but you'd have to cut so much it would be unrealistic as I have clearly shown. You can phase that in but it will take too much time with the national debt going way to high. Taxing gets you there faster and safer. \n\n \n History shows us that taxing gets us nowhere, except to higher debt. \n \n \nYeah, I'm sure people will be sooo upset that the rich are getting taxed more over having their jobs cut out completely and their kids home since schools closed. \n\n \n Higher taxing relates to having their jobs cut out. It's not necessarily an either-or thing. \n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000] The US is the policeman of the world. It's unfortunate, but it's reality. \n\n \n \nAnd how is that working out? Not well. \n\n \n It's working out a lot better than it would if we didn't police it. I'm not putting down other countries, but most of them simply don't have the military to protect themselves from an invasion from a middle east aggressor, like Ahmadinejad. Current US presence and status is the only thing that prevents a lot of world violence. I've heard that Canada's military is smaller than New York City's police force. \n \n \nThere is no correlation between raising taxes and unsustainable spending levels. In fact, the biggest deficit increases have come during times of tax cuts under Reagan and Bush. I don't think they are totally to blame though. \n\n \n There may not be a correlation on paper, but there is concerning the human nature of those who collect the taxes. I don't trust them like you do. \n \n \nNope. Clearly I think even you want change...change in spending levels.\n \n Nope! Accountants get it....perhaps this should be a sign, if you don't get it perhaps it's time to leave it to the experts (not economists....they suck). \n\n \n \"Leave it to the experts\"- where have we heard that before? Not from conservatives, that's for sure. I prefer a government of the people, myself. \n \n What do accountants know that economists don't? \n \n \nOh, I thought my comment was funny...I criticized your plan than asked you what it was hehe. \n\n \n I noticed that too. emoticon_xangel\n \n \nAnyway, the answer to your question is FY99. http://www.gao.gov/financial/fy99cfs.pdf\n \n Income tax rates were higher than they are today. Total revenue as a % of GDP was higher then. Spending was pretty low though (as a % of GDP which may not be the best figure). A lot of the difference was military spending and benefit reductions on welfare. \n\n \n How about spending on illegal aliens? \n \n FAIR: The Costs to Local Taxpayers for Illegal or \"Guest\" Workers\n \n \nTime to cut the spending and raise the taxes...there is no other way and from the looks of it, you can't show any different. Frankly, I think it is unfair and against everything I want (low government low taxes) but I've learned over the years that you can't force what you want on what reality is. The reality is that there is no other way. Once you fix the problem than you can get back to a low tax low government state...and believe it or not it would take much less time than you think.\n \n It's like a diet...you gotta cut calories AND exercise :)\n\n \n The following is a quote (over 200 years old) attributed to Alexander Fraser Tytler. (unverified) \n \n \n A democracy is always temporary in nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world's greatest civilizations from the beginning of history has been about 200 years. During those 200 years, these nations always progressed through the following sequence:\n \n * From bondage to spiritual faith;\n * From spiritual faith to great courage;\n * From courage to liberty;\n * From liberty to abundance;\n * From abundance to complacency;\n * From complacency to apathy;\n * From apathy to dependence;\n * From dependence back into bondage. \n\n \n Who can say that this isn't happening in the US right now? Of those 8 levels, which one are we currently in, level 5, 6, or 7? None of those three levels would allow your plan to work.\n \n The one biggest difference between today and 200 years ago, concerning the pathways and possible avoidance of the above scenario, is communication. The way people today can be instantly informed, or mis-informed. Would todays communication be a bigger advantage for liberty, or bondage? It's interesting to speculate on, because our generation may actually find out. emoticon_wow",

   "It's the news media that materially alters the big picture. ;) \nWhich is why I always use raw source data. I don't trust blogs, radio, tv, newspapers etc. For example I just crunched some tax numbers provided straight from the IRS for taxes (see my post in the \"raise taxes\" thread on this forum). \n \n \nYou and I both know that nothing will be done with things as they currently are - it will take a much bigger disaster to happen than what we're seeing today. \noh yeah, I'm not dumb enough to think anyone will implement a change that will work. I'm guessing we will wait until we are like Greece before we turn it around.\n \n \nAre you referring to only income tax, or all taxes? Does the GDP include \"production\" from ambulance chasing law firms? Insurance company profits? Gambling casino profits? Pharmaceuticals? \nI thought I posted the source..oops!\n \n This website is awesome: Federal State Local Government Revenue in United States 2010 - Charts Tables\n Or their sister site: Federal State Local Public Spending United States 2010 - Charts Tables History\n \n It is just GDP as normally calculated and I can't remember if I used total revenue or just personal federal income tax but both are pretty similar. \n \n\n History shows us that taxing gets us nowhere, except to higher debt. \nWell, I beg to differ. It isn't the taxing that gets us nowhere, it is the people in Congress who tax more and than spend twice what they get. Ideally you want higher taxes and lower spending right now to lower the deficit. \n \n \nHigher taxing relates to having their jobs cut out. It's not necessarily an either-or thing. \nI haven't seen any unbiased studies that show this to be true. We are talking about personal income tax here. If you are making 25 million a year, chances are you work for a major corporation or play in the NFL (do they make that much?). Anyway, corporations aren't just hiring people they don't need for the sake of giving people jobs. Those people are needed. I doubt they will choose to fire 15-20 employees so they can give one CEO an extra $2 million to cover the tax increase. Now if you own your own company you probably have under 100 employees and are considered a small to medium sized business. Do you honestly think they have extra labor hanging around to fire while competing with the big guys?\n \n Anywho, I don't have any research off hand to back me up but I don't recall ever seeing any either. Plus it doesn't make logical sense to me that people would be fired until you get to an extremely high rate (probably over 60%). Then again, these are unprecedented times so who knows.\n \n \nIt's working out a lot better than it would if we didn't police it.\nI don't think this is true. We would blow Iran out of the water..err..sand... if we had 1/3rs the force we have now. Plus it seems the more we \"police\" the more we are the target This strategy is not sustainable and simply won't work. Not to mention the neglect it has caused to our own countries security. Personally I'd rather my tax dollars be spent defending our southern border than being spent blowing up some $150 hut in Iraq. \n \n \n\n \"Leave it to the experts\"- where have we heard that before? Not from conservatives, that's for sure. I prefer a government of the people, myself. \n \n What do accountants know that economists don't? \nAccountants know reality while economists don't. Accountants are out there reporting, reviewing, and making decisions based upon real data. Economists like projections and theories. RAWR.\n \n The experts have never been listened to. Thing is, when someone says it you have to make sure they actually are an expert. David Walker is an expert for example. \n \n\n How about spending on illegal aliens? \n \n FAIR: The Costs to Local Taxpayers for Illegal or \"Guest\" Workers\nEvery penny helps but realistically you wouldn't see the $80 billion on the federal level in savings. A lot of that is state money or money \"eaten\" by companies or money that is more fixed in nature...for example [not that this is true] if you have 10 students in a school that costs you $100 to run and one is illegal you say we are spending $10 on an illegal. Well, if that person goes away it will still cost $100 to run the school because the teacher isn't taking a pay cut!\n \n Nevertheless, it would still benefit to have immigration controlled like most countries. \n \n \nThe following is a quote (over 200 years old) attributed to Alexander Fraser Tytler. (unverified) \nHaha, that is a great quote and probably true. \n \n \nWho can say that this isn't happening in the US right now? Of those 8 levels, which one are we currently in, level 5, 6, or 7? None of those three levels would allow your plan to work.\nHaha, taking the Daewoo approach huh? No use in trying to stop a tidal wave; better off soaking up the sun on the beach while you can :)\n \n I'd say we are in 5 going on 6.\n \n \nThe one biggest difference between today and 200 years ago, concerning the pathways and possible avoidance of the above scenario, is communication. The way people today can be instantly informed, or mis-informed. Would todays communication be a bigger advantage for liberty, or bondage?

(is it so long ago? where did it go?)\n \n \n... Already long ago, from when we sold our vote to no man, the People have abdicated our duties; for the People who once upon a time handed out military command, high civil office, legions - everything, now restrains itself and anxiously hopes for just two things: bread and circuses\n (Juvenal, Satire 10.77-81) \n\n \n Bread & circuses?

From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is always followed by a dictatorship.\"\n \n Imho, where we are now: Voters have become conned into voting for candidates who show special interests that only benefit the minority (or magically, with the 'bait & switch trick', turn corporations into people). The majority of the people are conned into thinking (or believing) if they vote for the minority interest, the benefits will 'trickle down' to them.

Well the American people must continue to bail us out because we have 'trickled down' to them.

   "Iraq Disaster: We Broke It, We (Just) Bought It \n \n But these cases of disaster capitalism are amateurish compared with what is unfolding at Iraq's oil ministry. It started with no-bid service contracts announced for ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP and Total (they have yet to be signed but are still on course). Paying multinationals for their technical expertise is not unusual. What is odd is that such contracts almost invariably go to oil service companies--not to the oil majors, whose work is exploring, producing and owning carbon wealth. As London-based oil expert Greg Muttitt points out, the contracts make sense only in the context of reports that the oil majors have insisted on the right of first refusal on subsequent contracts handed out to manage and produce Iraq's oil fields. In other words, other companies will be free to bid on those future contracts, but these companies will win. \n \n One week after the no-bid service deals were announced, the world caught its first glimpse of the real prize. After years of back-room arm-twisting, Iraq is officially flinging open six of its major oil fields, accounting for around half of its known reserves, to foreign investors. According to Iraq's oil minister, the long-term contracts will be signed within a year. While ostensibly under control of the Iraq National Oil Company, foreign firms will keep 75 percent of the value of the contracts, leaving just 25 percent for their Iraqi partners. \n \n That kind of ratio is unheard of in oil-rich Arab and Persian states, where achieving majority national control over oil was the defining victory of anticolonial struggles. According to Muttitt, the assumption until now was that foreign multinationals would be brought in to develop brand-new fields in Iraq--not to take over ones that are already in production and therefore require minimal technical support. \"The policy was always to allocate these fields to the Iraq National Oil Company,\" he told me. This is a total reversal of that policy, giving INOC a mere 25 percent instead of the planned 100 percent. \n \n So what makes such lousy deals possible in Iraq, which has already suffered so much? Ironically, it is Iraq's suffering--its never-ending crisis--that is the rationale for an arrangement that threatens to drain its treasury of its main source of revenue. The logic goes like this: Iraq's oil industry needs foreign expertise because years of punishing sanctions starved it of new technology and the invasion and continuing violence degraded it further. And Iraq urgently needs to start producing more oil. Why? Again because of the war. The country is shattered, and the billions handed out in no-bid contracts to Western firms have failed to rebuild the country. And that's where the new no-bid contracts come in: they will raise more money, but Iraq has become such a treacherous place that the oil majors must be induced to take the risk of investing. Thus the invasion of Iraq neatly creates the argument for its subsequent pillage. \n \n Several of the architects of the Iraq War no longer even bother to deny that oil was a major motivator. On National Public Radio's To the Point, Fadhil Chalabi, one of the primary Iraqi advisers to the Bush Administration in the lead-up to the invasion, recently described the war as \"a strategic move on the part of the United States of America and the UK to have a military presence in the Gulf in order to secure [oil] supplies in the future.\" Chalabi, who served as Iraq's oil under secretary and met with the oil majors before the invasion, described this as \"a primary objective.\" \n \n Invading countries to seize their natural resources is illegal under the Geneva Conventions. That means that the huge task of rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure--including its oil infrastructure--is the financial responsibility of Iraq's invaders. They should be forced to pay reparations. (Recall that Saddam Hussein's regime paid $9 billion to Kuwait in reparations for its 1990 invasion.) Instead, Iraq is being forced to sell 75 percent of its national patrimony to pay the bills for its own illegal invasion and occupation. \n Naomi Klein\n\n \n Is violating the Geneva Convention what people mean when they speak about American 'exceptionalism.' For Pan's sake I hope not!\n \n I thought one of the definitions of insanity is to \"keep on doing the same things over & over again & expect different results?",
