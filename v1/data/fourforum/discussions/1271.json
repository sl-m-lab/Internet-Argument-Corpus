   "The most powerful weapon against anti-gunners are guns themselves. No don't shoot them. Take as many people to the shooting range as possible. Range fees are anywhere from 5-10 dollars. Your own firearms, an extra box of ammo, and your personal instruction. That is all it takes. So 10-15 bucks. Split it? What ever, just get non-shooters to the range.\n \n Let's face it. There are lots of guys who have never shot a weapon and would not pass up the chance to do so. \n \n Let everyone around you know your a shooter. You do not have to be a rapid defender. Just let people around you know that is what you do and you have fun doing it.\n \n I meet with 1 or 2 ladies a year who for what ever reason NEED protection. Take them to the range. They will be for ever grateful.\n \n Once you get them there and they have fun. If they decide to explore more, then them over to the range master to get pointed in the right direction for saftey and education. That goes for both the guys and gals.\n \n One thing I learned that novice shooters are going to have lots of pre-conceptions about firearms. Such as safe behavior. Muzzle awareness. Recoil. Regular fear of a new enviornement (the range). If they get started with disciplined and safe instruction. They realize the fun and challenge of marksmanship. Somehow anti-gunners and novices envision shoters get jollies from being trigger happy. You and I know that is not true. Discipline, saftey, focus, and marksmanship is totally couner to trigger happy shooting.\n \n I once took a group of scouts to the range for AR-15 instruction. The trigger happy ones were totally disappointed because they expended thier ammo and accomplished NOTHING. While the more disciplined and patient scouts learned marksmanship is a worthwhile effort by itself.\n \n My $.02",

You're right, it works like a charm.\n\n \n What I find most suprising is the notion that shooters are trigger happy. That somehow killing and blood thirst are part of marksmanship. Everyone who is responsible and safe knows that this is false. Hunters do not harvest animals for the purpose of killing. All the hunters I know want to use shot placement and sufficient caliber to take the animal with as little suffering as possible. Target shooters have to exercise mental and physical discipline to place shots. So then how does \"nut\" fit into those ideas? When someone takes a firearm and handles them with saftey and discipline for the first time, they realize that \"nut\" does not fit the description of gun owners.",

Numerous female employees became concerned when they discovered I kept firearms in the trunk of my car. Since I practice several times a month, I usually have firearms in my trunk. Shortly, the owner offered to buy whatever firearms that I legally kept in my car, because the ladies thought I might \"go postal.\" It seems I made a mistake in showing one of my favorite firearms to a fellow worker during lunch, who later mentioned it to another employee, and so on. Since I park off site, I had no reason to comply with the company's no firearm regulation, or agree to sell my guns to the concerned owner. Several months later, the MIS department was held hostage for several hours by a shotgun wielding begrudged ex-employee...not the \"type\" one would expect to act irrationally with a firearm. Swat involvement followed...not a pretty day. Turned out the guy borrowed the shotgun and neither owned or practiced with firearms. But he wasn't the \"sinister one\" whit guns in truny. :)",
