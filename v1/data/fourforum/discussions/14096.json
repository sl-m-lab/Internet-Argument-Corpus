They have no legitimate state interest in regulating marriage since marriage is essentially a religious institution. IF, however, the government is going to recognize marriage legally, and even perform marriages itself, to refuse gays to marry is without question discrimination and unconstitutional.\n \n In none of the societies you mention above was marriage actually codified.

OR, are you really so insecure and worthless a person as to believe that by letting 2 gay people marry it would cheapen your marriage?

By the terms freeman and freewoman in this definition are meant, not only that they are free and not slaves, but also that they are clear of all bars to a lawful marriage.\n \n To make a valid marriage, the parties must be willing to contract, able to contract, and have actually contracted.They must be willing to contract. Those persons, therefore, who have no legal capacity in point of intellect, to make a contract, cannot legally marry, as XXXXXX, lunatics, and infants; males under the age of fourteen, and females under the age of twelve; and when minors over those ages marry, they must have the consent of their parents or guardians. There is no will when the person is mistaken in the party whom he intended to marry; as, if Peter intending to marry Maria, through error or mistake of person, in fact marries Eliza; but an error in the fortune, as if a man marries a woman whom he believes to be rich, and he finds her to be poor; or in the quality, as if he marries a woman whom he took to be chaste, and whom he finds of an opposite character, this does not invalidate the marriage, because in these cases the error is only of some quality or accident, and not in the person.When the marriage is obtained by force or fraud, it is clear that there is no consent; it is, therefore, void ab initio, and may be treated as null by every court in which its validity may incidentally be called in question. \n\n \n \n \nYou are floundering\n\n \n No, YOU are floundering.

You seem to accept that from a legal standpoint marriage is just like any other partnership contract, but then expect us to be dumb enough to believe that for some reason that you are unwilling to explain it would be a logistical nightmare to break one...despite the fact that multi party contracts are dissolved every day. Then you try to make the ludicrous claim that since I have not proven it would NOT be a mess to do so, that your position must be correct.\n \n Sorry. That is not the way things work.

   "Considering that argument and comparing the size of the population of heterosexuals vs. homosexuals, I say lets get rid of heterosexual marriage and allow gay marriage. Much cheaper.\n\n \n What you fail to consider is that the MAJORITY of Americans believe that the promotion of family stability was worth rewarding. The verdict isn't the same on gay marriage. That's why I have always said that they need a better PR plan than their current \"in your face\" anti-Christian tactics. Gays should show the benefit of formal gay unions on the stability of families. I'm sure a few tear-jerking commercials about kids being taken away from their other mother and given to estranged grandparents would go a long way towards their cause. The issue needs to be humanized in order for them to succeed. Alienating Christians is a loser's gambit. \n \n\n This argument is quite atrocious if you think about it. Can you imagine allowing it to be put to a vote on other financial matters? Voting about whether black people can drive on publicy funded roads? Whether Asians can attend public school? And then to claim its only because of \"financial concerns\" and not prejudice? Really?\n \n\n \n We're not talking about inalienable rights here, Jito. We're really talking about the perks in a civilized society. There's no prejudice involved, it's a reward versus no reward situation. Conform to the guidelines and you will be rewarded. Don't meet the guidelines and you can't receive the rewards. Period. Race is not an issue. \n \n\n This argument assumes homosexual Americans aren't part of the \"people\". \n \n\n \n No, it assumes that they aren't part of the majority \"OF the People\".\n \n \n\n Anyway, as I pretty much point out above, the fiscal argument is bogus and you know it. People, including you, don't support gay marriage because, for one reason or another, you think its icky. Be honest, Jesus is watching.\n\n \n I've stated my personal beliefs many times in the past. I'm OK with civil unions with all of the rights and privileges of marriage, sans the name marriage. To me, it IS a sacrament and that's how I treat it. \n \n\n There have been supreme court cases that have called marriage a right.\n \n\n Judicial Fiat law can be changed along with the SCOTUS, the Constitution can't. \n \n\n To allow a majority vote on the legal and civil rights of a group of people is completely against the spirit, if not the letter of the constitution. For I can not really hold it against people to vote their conscience (even though it is wrong), but I certainly hold the govornment acocuntable for allowing them to do so. It is one of our country's more despicable acts and I do not question that time will one day demonstrate it as such.\n \n\n \n You favor people being able to vote their conscience, but condemn the government for allowing them to do so? XXX?!!\n \n\n Yes, but only heterosexuals get to marry their chosen mate.\n\n Homosexuals can marry the exact same people that heteros can. No more, no less. That's equality.",

   "So then you would agree that if 80% of the population were atheists that that 80% of the population should be able to change the constitution to make Christianity or any other religion illegal and remove religious freedom?\n\n \n If you can get through the proceedures to ammend the constitution to remove the religious freedoms enumerated by the first ammendment, then yes, by all means start a petition drive for a ballot initative banning Christianity in your state. \n Since there is no constitutional provision assuring a right to marry any person you choose, people opposed to gay marriage can and have put forward ballot initatives defining marriage. Also, people have the right to vote their own opinion on these initatives. In that same light you are perfectly free to collect signature for an initiative banning hetrosexual marriages, or all marriages for that matter.\n \n \nThe unfair part is that everyone gets to vote their opinon on my rights but I do get to vote my opion on theirs. Why can you not see this?\n\n First, since when was government sanctioned marriage a right? Second, as I said above, if you want to put forth a ballot initiative to ban gov't recognition of all marriages, be my guest. I'll vote my opinion on it and you can vote yours.",
