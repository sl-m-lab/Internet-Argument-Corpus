   "Our murderous drug trade and burgeoning gang problems are atrocious and I make no excuses for them. However, no evidence leads us to conclude that gun control will give us lower rates of crime and violence. \n \n I love your AIC which is equivalent to our FBI. Unlike England's Home Office, the AIC reports crime statistics accurately. Since both England and Australia are two countries most like ours, it is in fact a petree dish if you will, for what would happen here if we enacted even the strictest of gun control, like you have enacted in Australia and England. \n \n The facts and graphs are taken from here.   Australian crime : facts and figures 2007  \n \n Please note each graph. \n \n The first one, your murder rate remains constant. The figures for gun murders have dropped, but the murder rate with it's normal fluctuations is pretty much flat lined. \n Murder 1989 to 2006 http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/facts/2007/fig012.png \n \n However, as people are left more unprotected, by the loss of firearm freedoms, both graphs for assaults and sexual assaults have gone up. The criminals seem to be embolden. \n Assaults 1995-2006 http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/facts/2007/fig018.png \n \nFigure 18 : Assaults, by month, 1995-2006 (number)\n \u00b7 The trend in assaults shows an average growth of 5% each year between 1995 and 2006. This is four times the annual growth of the Australian population over the same period.\n \u00b7 Assault is seasonal. The number of assaults peaks in the spring and summer months of October to February, and is lowest during April to July.\n\n \n Sexual assaults 1995-2006 http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/facts/2007/fig022.png\n \n Figure 22 : Sexual assault victims, by month, 1995-2006\n \u00b7 Reported sexual assaults have increased by an average of 4% each year since 1995.\n \u00b7 The number of recorded sexual assaults is typically highest during the months of January to March and August to November and lowest during April to July. \n\n \n And unfortunately gun control does not mean that the criminals cannot get their weapons. They have been either making their own, stealing them from homes or even the police, or importing them in with their drugs.\n  Gun blitz launched \n Bikie gangs are believed to be behind a sophisticated firearms smuggling network, importing illegal automatic and semi-automatic weapons.\n \n As many as 20,000 illegal pistols were seized in Australia last year. A fully automatic pistol can fetch much more than $10,000 on the black market.\n\n   Thousands of pistols seized in raids \nOfficers from \"Strikeforce Footstools\" raided seven homes across southern and western Sydney yesterday, seizing 753 guns and firearm parts that could be used to create another 2,500 guns.\n\n An official report by the AIC into this illegal gun problem .   Weapons, drugs and crime Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) \n \n And a news article about the report. Link   Australian Institute of Criminology study -- Tough new weapons laws 'miss hard core of criminal underworld'   \n CANBERRA - The introduction of tough laws to control guns and knives appears to be failing to keep lethal weapons out of the hands of Australian criminals. &#8230;. reported that while new laws may have helped reduce the number of knives and guns in illicit circulation, they have failed to deter hard-core criminals. It also pointed to a large firearms black market.\n",
