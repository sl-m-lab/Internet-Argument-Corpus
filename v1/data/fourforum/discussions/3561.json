   "I thought there would be reviews of the film on this thread. Owell..\n \n It seems like what this film did was talk about POWs and the horrors they suffered in one breath and then switch to talking about the antiwar movement in the other and then just leave it with the impression that one was directly caused by the other. It then just says that John Kerry was involved in the antiwar movement and somehow that makes him personally responsible for what the Vietcong did to POWs. \n \n It gives the impression, stopping a hair's breadth short of actually saying it, that the antiwar movement was responsible for 'losing' the Vietnam War.\n \n I like the way the narrator asks a 'rhetorical' question whenever he doesn't want to directly accuse Kerry of something.\n \n \"Was he accusing me and my fellow vets of committing the same atrocities he committed?\" was the most obvious.\n \n It's not totally convincing. I don't think it'll change any minds, but it will reinforce any anti-kerry feelings in Bush supporters.\n \n .",
