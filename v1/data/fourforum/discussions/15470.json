   "We have a huge deficit because Ronald Reagan, George Herbert Walker Bush and George Walker Bush went on a massive spending spree and put it all on the national credit card and kept it off budget.\n \n Obama decided to stop lying about the actual deficit and insisted that all of the Reagan and Bush spending sprees be put on budget.\n \n George Walker Bush was a damned fool who was the very first president to engage us in a couple of unnecessary wars while cutting taxes on the very, very wealthy at the same time. Wars have to be paid for, you know.\n \n These wars benefited only the very wealthy, who at the very same time shifted the tax burden for these wars from themselves to the average working person.\n \n So, why shouldn't the very wealthy, who are benefiting from war by their being war profiteering crooks, why shouldn't they pay their way?",

Oh right, the president can't propose a bill in congress nor vote on it. Oops! Guess we should see who was in power in Congress during those times as well.\n \n \nObama decided to stop lying about the actual deficit and insisted that all of the Reagan and Bush spending sprees be put on budget.\nThis just isn't true.",
