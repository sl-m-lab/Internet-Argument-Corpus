It should be an awesome game. It's likely to be a very low-scoring game though considering both of these teams' defenses. Low scoring games often come down to field goals and we all know which one of these teams has the better kicker :) \n \n I picked Indianapolis to win, but that sure as heck does not mean I want those :xcensoreders to win!\n \n The Pittsburgh-San Diego game was a hard pick. The Oakland-San Fancisco one was hard as well but sadly for completely different reasons.",
