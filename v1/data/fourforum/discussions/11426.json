   "Q: President Bush believes that gay couples should not be permitted to adopt children. Do you agree with that?\n \n Mr. McCain: I think that we've proven that both parents are important in the success of a family so, no I don't believe in gay adoption.\n \n Q: Even if the alternative is the kid staying in an orphanage, or not having parents.\n \n Mr. McCain: I encourage adoption and I encourage the opportunities for people to adopt children I encourage the process being less complicated so they can adopt as quickly as possible. And Cindy and I are proud of being adoptive parents.\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/us/politics/13text-mccain.html?_r=3&oref=slogin&pagewanted=print&oref=slogin&oref=slogin\n \n \n \nEarlier this month, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) took an extreme position on gay adoption, telling the New York Times he believes in \"traditional\" families even if it means leaving children in orphanages. \"I think that we've proven that both parents are important in the success of a family so, no I don't believe in gay adoption,\" he said.\n \n But in follow-up statement, McCain aide Jill Hazelbaker backtracked, stating, \"McCain could have been clearer.\" She added that the senator would support gay adoption if there were no alternative:\n \n However, as an adoptive father himself...he recognizes that there are many abandoned children who have yet to find homes. McCain believes that in those situations that caring parental figures are better for the child than the alternative.\n \n Interviewed on ABC today, however, McCain reverted to his original radical position, telling George Stephanopolous that he does not support gay adoption in any circumstance:\n  McCAIN: I think that family values are important, when we have two parent - families that are of parents that are the traditional family.\n \n Q: But there are several hundred thousand children in the country who don't have a home. And if a gay couple wants to adopt them, what's wrong with that?\n \n MCCAIN: I am for the values that two parent families, the traditional family represents.\n McCain didn't acknowledge that a two-parent family can also consist of same-sex parents. Unlike his spokeswoman, he also didn't recognize that rejecting adoptions by same-sex parents means leaving thousands of children with no parents. As Winnie Stachelberg and Robert Gordon noted, about 130,000 children wait in the foster care system each year for a permanent home. And every year, half of these children are never placed.\n \n In the interview, McCain repeatedly said that he is \"for the values and principles that two parent families represent.\" He also said preserving traditional families is \"not the reason why I'm running for president of the United States.\" Just seconds later, however, he reversed course and bluntly stated, \"I'm running for president of the United States because I want to help with family values.\"\n\n http://thinkprogress.org/2008/07/27/mccain-gay-adoption-2/\n There is video of the interview at this link...\n \n McCain is doing the standard two-faced \"anti-gay adoption dance\", catering to the anti-gay religious right at the expense of the welfare of the children.\n \n Over and over again, research PROVES that gays are just as good parents as straights are. There is no SCIENTIFIC question on that subject.\n And preventing gay adoption WOULD HARM the children. Even if one temporarily adopts the mindset that \"straight couple is better\", one should easily realize that we're talking about a child WITH a gay parent, as opposed to NO parent.\n \n The hypocrisy of their stance is easily demonstrated when the question of SINGLE parents comes up. By their claims, it's the \"man/woman\" combination which is supposedly superior to a relationship that has only one gender.\n But a SINGLE parent not only has just one gender, there is only ONE PARENT.\n Do you hear ANYBODY talking of outlawing THEIR adoption capabilities????\n emoticon_xdonno \n \n Preventing gay adoption harms the child, goes against the established science, and contradicts itself on the \"single-parent\" issue ...\n \n It's PURE PREJUDICE. Plain and simple.\n And now McCain is embracing it...\n Speaking the \"lines\" that we've heard so many times before, ignoring the reality of what he is asking for, contradicting himself on the issue... :xbanghead",

   "McCain keeps demonstrating how he wants to hump the leg of the Republican \"anti-gay\" agenda over and over again...\n \n Here, he talks about how a specific vice-presidential candidate being \"pro-gay rights\" gives him negative marks as a possibility to be a running mate.\n In the interview this morning, McCain suggested that Ridge would be more palatable to social conservatives than Bloomberg.\n \n \"I think it's a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro-life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro-choice. We just have a--albeit strong--but just it's a disagreement. And I think Ridge is a great example of that. Far moreso than Bloomberg, because Bloomberg is pro-gay rights, pro, you know, a number of other issues.\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/406glxpt.asp\n \n Personally, I DO denote a difference between being \"against gay marriage\" and being \"anti-gay\".\n I give leeway for somebody who wants \"marriage\" to be \"heterosexual\", but at the same time that person must be supportive of an alternative like \"civil unions\".\n \n But you'll note that McCain didn't even specify \"gay marriage\" here. He encompassed a BROADER spectrum of \"pro-gay rights\".\n And quite frankly, when a person examines that spectrum, the opposition (IMO) to \"gay rights\" almost automatically places the person in the \"anti-gay\" category.\n * Employment Rights: Being against sexual orientation employment protection means the person WANTS an employer to have the power to fire a homosexual JUST cause that homosexual is gay.\n * Adoption: The \"pro-gay\" side means that gay people have the capability to adopt. The opposite side would prevent gay people from adopting.\n * Military: The \"pro-gay\" side means that gay people can serve in the military, legally. The opposite wants them tossed out...\n \n And so on and so on...\n \n McCain is sending a clear message of where his loyalties lie. Or rather, what he opposes...\n And even more interesting, he clearly states the REAL INTENTIONS of his \"Republican\" party and how Republicans are OPPOSED to \"pro-gay\"...",
