And it came against a priest with a particularly high profile: the Rev. Marcial Maciel Degollado, 86, the founder of the Legionaries of Christ, one of the fastest growing Catholic communities, praised often by Pope John Paul II.\n \n The statement said that Father Maciel would not undergo a church trial for the allegations against him, which were not disclosed, though at least nine men had accused him of molestation. The reasons, the statement said, were Father Maciel's \"advanced age\" and \"weak health.\"\n \n But the statement said the Vatican's doctrinal office had decided \"to invite the father to a life reserved to prayer and penitence, renouncing any public ministry. The Holy Father has approved these decisions.\"\n \n Reactions to the Vatican decision varied, with some praising the Pope for taking so public a stand and other saying it did not go far enough, given the seriousness of the allegations against Father Maciel himself and the wider crisis of confidence in the church over sexual abuse.\n \n \"It certainly could be stronger,\" said John Wilkins, the former editor of the influential British Catholic magazine, the Tablet.\n \n \"But this is the founder of the Legionaries,\" he said. \"This is a pretty devastating judgment for the Legionaries. For a new movement like that, the reputation and position of the founder is critical.\"\n \n The judgment was first made public on Thursday on the website of National Catholic Reporter. The Vatican document did not specify exactly what duties Father Maciel would be barred from, but National Catholic reporter quoted anonymous Vatican officials as saying he could not celebrate mass publicly, give speeches or interviews.\n \n The Legionaries was founded by Father Maciel in Mexico in 1941 and has now grown to include about 650 priests worldwide and 2,500 seminarians in 20 countries. The order runs a dozen universities, and recently opened its first degree-granting college in the United States, the University of Sacramento. Father Maciel stepped down from the order's leadership this year. Pope John Paul II had repeatedly praised him and his work, most recently at a public audience last Nov. 30, for the 60th anniversary of his ordination to the priesthood. \n \n In 1994, in a trip to Mexico, Pope John Paul II called him \"an efficacious guide to youth\" -- a statement that several victims said prompted them to make complaints.",

They won't put him through the stress of that. He's already stated his innocence. So the determination to remove him from public ministry and avoid a trial may be a favor granted him due to his service to the Church, the feeling that the charges are unfounded, and due to his health/age. It may not mean that they are removing him because they think him guilty of misconduct.",
