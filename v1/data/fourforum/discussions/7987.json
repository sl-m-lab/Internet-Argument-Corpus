   "They are one of the contracts he made with the nation of Israel through his prophet moses. They pertain to how humans act towards each other but cannot govern God as he is completely perfect and allpowerful. If you read the old testament after the commandmets were given. (all of them including the ones on clean and unclean, mildew, rape, grainofferings, etc.) invariably every time the Hebrews would stop following the law God would isolate, plague, or exile them. God has kept his side of the bargain (blessing and protecting the israelites) as long as they have kept theirs. God also made a deeper Contract abraham his contract was that he would bless abraham and his desendence, and through abrahams line Gods son (or the second of the trenity) Jesus would be born into the world to become the last perfect sacrifice. All this happened and now the law is fufilled by Christ. In other words: Someone can only approach God if he is Pure, nobody is pure except through Christ who at the time hasn't been born yet, so God lovingly gave the people a way to become pure before him and approach him. Once christ came the law became useless. That doewnt mean that the Law doesnt have some good things in it, but if you know Christ those things should come naturally to you (duh i shouldnt kill my brohter). So in effect their are two ways to go to heaven 1. By trusting in christ to cleanse you of you sins, and 2. follow the law completely and utterly. \n \n PS: some laws are hard to understand, like if a girl or woman is raped she is to be stoned to death. This is because she is unclean in the sight of God. If you so much as touch an unclean animall with the hem of you clothes you have to do the purification offering with a perfect lamb.

That is all the beauty I need to witness to keep my heart warm and my thoughts pure (well almost pure).\n\n \n Wow, there are so many logical fallacies in your argument that is very difficult to answer. But, I will try. You completely take out of context what I was saying, that is first. The original question is whether or not the 10 commandments apply to God's behavior. The doctrine of christianity and of Judaism (and islam for that matter) all say that the 10 commandments came from God and were God description of His own Holy Righteousness.\n \n Now whether or not you understand those terms that is the doctrine. That being said, the point simply put is that GOD is the only eternally existent. You and I are not. Given that, it would actually be WRONG for God to demand glorification for anyone BUT Himself. If He is perfect (as the ten commandments imply) then HE SHOULD BE the object of glorification.\n \n I am trying to ignore your obvious appeals to emotionalism but that is difficult. Much of your argument rests on the fact that YOU find certain things to be appaling. You have the right and freedom to do so. But let's be honest about it that you are acting as if you might know more than the creator of the universe. Regardless of whether or not you believe in His existence, you are arguing within the framework that implies his existence. For one to argue whether or not the 10 commandments describe God you must accept that God exists otherwise the argument is moot. So if you want to argue the lack of existence then, start another thread as this one is not about that.\n \n EF",

I guess just to say that I think your logic is flawed.\n\n \n Actually, my comparison is perfect. The issue is definition. God is the definer of good and evil. Period. God is good. He defines good. Whatever God does is good. He also defined people. He gets to \"judge\". That is what judgement is. It is a determination of good or evil. If people are left to decide what is good and evil then they are left with SUBJECTIVE standards. Such things lead to statements like, \"At least I am better than that other person\" or \"I don't do that kind of thing\" etc. This particular line of thinking has led to all kinds of racism and cults and ethnocentrism. HOwever, Since God is what Good is then there is an objective standard by which people live.\n \n The next thing people find out is that they cannot possibly live up to God's standards of good. People then complain that no one will go to heaven because no one is good. Certain verses come to mind on this Romans 3:23 which says that all have missed the mark(sinned) and fall short of the glory of God. 6:23 also says for the wages of missing the mark (sin) is death but the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n \n The subjective behavioral standard, no one lives up to. NO christian, jew muslim, etc lives up to it. The biggest problem with most religions is that they declare how man can live up to God's standards. The christianity that I know declares that it is impossible to live up to those standards but through Christ God has given a free gift if one will but receive it as a gift. The chapter 6 reference compares what is earned with what is freely given.\n \n This is the problem most have when it comes to these standards. They assume that christians say that they meet the standards. The truth is that we do not. It is purely an act of Grace.\n \n EF",

So far, your argument consists of:\n \n 1) EF is bullheaded and arrogant and unable to see contradictions (ad hom)\n 2) Ef posts stupid and irrational junk and calls it logic (ad hom)\n 3) EF is wrong (no analysis). Trebor is ultimate authority (not sure how to label this particular fallacy, but it is clearly illogical.\n \n My arguments as posted already state:\n \n 1) Given: The Question is \"Do the ten commandments apply to God's Behavior\"\n 2) The Given asks a question about GOd\n 3) If God does not exist then the question would be \"Do the ten commandments apply to the Behavior of someone who doesn't exist?\" \n 4) If one does not exist one does not have behavior\n Therefore\n 4) The question means nothing if God is not assumed to exist.\n \n Additionally:\n \n 1) Same Given\n 2) The given assumes the ten commandments exist. \n 3) The ten commandments are a reference to those written in book of Exodus. This is an assumption but reasonable given the topic and the forum. If they are a reference to \"another\" ten commandment One would need to specify that as the normal definition of the ten commandments is the one that would refer to the book of exodus. \n 4) The book of exodus also says that God wrote the ten commandments. \n 5) Therefore it is reasonable to assume that the God of the question is the same one that the book of exodus says wrote the ten commandments.\n \n I can go on, but the point of this post is to show that I have provided analysis that is perfectly logical. Trebor simply does not argue.\n \n EF",

   "Look, you can't go around making up the rules about god's behavior or characteristics, e.g., God is all good, therefore..., and then call it logical. You make those statements as though they are incontrovertible facts.\n \n I don't see how I attacked you. Don't presume to tell me how my feelings have colored my arguments, when you look through the world believing in invisible friends. \n \n By the way, I do not dislike christians, I dislike christianity. You know, hate the sin, not the sinner.\n\n \n Perhaps I jumped the gun in claiming that you attacked me. Please explain your post thus\n \n \n It seems to be you cannot criticize someone's else's logic and then counter it with God stuff and pretend you are making a valid argument. God makes all the rules and defines good/bad and is eternal (space time continuum, indeed) sorta defies all logic. \n \n \"you're wrong because God says so, pfffft!\"\n\n \n Your grammar is a bit off so I may have misunderstood what you intended to say. It looks to me as if your first sentence claims that I hve poor logic because I use \"god stuff\" which would simply be an attack on me and not the argument. Please help me to understand what you were trying to say. When you include the quoted part that ends with pfffft! then it looks as if you are being sarcastic which is a form of attack on a person. Sarcasm is a word that comes from the greek words sarco and chiasma which mean litterally \"flesh ripping\". That is where I came to that conclusion, but it is very possible that you did not mean to communicate that way. I would welcome your clarification and do apologize for my hasty conclusion.\n \n EF",
