   "Ambivalence Part I\n \n A week ago, I posted a thread on the nature of sexual orientation or what I will now refer to as sex partner preference (SPP). The thread challenged heterosexuals to prove that SPP was a choice by performing a self test. \n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2942\n \n Most people obviously have a SPP for the opposite sex, some for both sexes and still others for the same sex. The cause of a person's SPP is assumed to be biological and/or genetic. My own experience, the experience of other people and the research of some scientists summarized in a book I had read some time ago led me to that conclusion. The question now becomes this: What, if anything, would cause second thoughts about such a conclusion? The past week has been a learning experience for me and it all started with this article:\n \n http://eserver.org/bs/14/Sartelle.html\n \n I'm actually not sure how to react to this. The article is obviously written by a gay rights advocate so homophobia cannot be blamed here. If I read this right, it shouldn't matter if being gay is natural or not. The only thing that should matter is freedom of choice and tolerance for whatever choices one makes, barring those choices that violate other people's rights or cause harm. It also rings an alarm bell as to the dangers of genetic research given the history of fascism. \n \n Perhaps this is an isolated case of pro-gay gene ambivalence by a pro gay writer?\n Not necessarily. Alas, I come to this link:\n \n http://web.archive.org/web/20021221031129/http://www.wench.com/fabulana\n \n This one is a bit more recent (1999). Maybe I have tapped into something that isn't getting mainstream media attention. Is there fear out there that pro-gay advocates might actually refute the idea of natural causes for sexual orientation? What would motivate such fear? Maybe the anti-gay right would use this to their advantage? \n \n Here are a few more articles:\n \n http://www.newdirection.ca/a_biol.htm\n \n http://web.archive.org/web/20010622202222/http://www.informinc.co.uk/LM/LM50/LM50_Homo.html\n \n http://eserver.org/gender/exploding-the-gene-myth.html\n \n http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/genetics/biochallenge.html\n \n The final link may be a bit slow coming up but have patience.\n \n What conclusions do I draw from this? For starters, it would seem to suggest that there is a bit of paranoia out there about the implications of any discovery of natural causes for SPP. It also suggests a corresponding paranoia about the implications of the possible discovery that there is in fact no \"gay\" gene. Perhaps paranoia is too strong of a word. For now, I will simply say that I'm having some second thoughts. Whatever conclusions anybody else will draw, I won't even begin to predict.",

   "I read those articles *Except for the second one which did not come up at all* and my take is basically this: Yes, there is no solid evidence that a person who is gay was born that way, yet there is no conclusive evidence against it either. \n Experiences, environment, biology, psychology and perhaps genetics all play roles. \n Indeed, how a person acts on those urges is indeed their choice, but the fact that those urges exist cannot be determined as to why. \n \n What I have noticed is that complete lack of questioning of heterosexuality and it's inborn-ness vs. choice. \n No one seems to question heterosexuals. Opting for pressumption and acceptance. \n \n Not one of those studies ever studied those who claim homosexual but not sexually active. No one ever asks why a homosexual would not be sexually active. No one ever stops to think that maybe, just maybe there might be homosexuals out there who are just simply grossed out by the idea of homosexual sex. \n I believe adding those such persons into the mix would indeed have a huge impact on these studies and their findings. \n \n Why would someone identify as homosexual and not engage in homosexual sex? \n \n For that matter why would a heterosexual identify as such and also choose to not engage in heterosexual sex? \n I am not talking about those who have religious explainations/requirements either. I'm talking about heterosexuals who may indeed find the idea of heterosexual sex just as unappealing. \n \n There is the SPP of A-sexuality as well. Those who do not have sex because it is physically unappealing, not matter what the gender of the person or partner. (Which in this case would be lack of partner) \n And which between homosexuality vs heterosexuality those such persons would identify closest to. \n \n I believe that if a person claims to identify as homosexual or heterosexual that person should still be granted complete and equal access to rights, protections and liberties granted by laws which govern their specific citizenship. \n The fact that the question of homosexual marriage issues still only include TWO - CONCENTING - ADULT - HUMANS is the nexus of the issue at hand and that all the studies and findings be damned. \n No one questions heterosexuals. So why question homosexuals. \n Just learn to deal with it.",

   "Wow, some of those are really long articles to read. Heavy stuff!\n \n It seems the basic conclusion I could come to is that regardless of root or cause of homsexuality two things are important to think about. First off, it appears impoosible to sexual orientation, the level to which you are attracted to each of the sexes appears to be unchangable. I can see that some people with a lean towards both sexes may be able to stop acknowldeging a same sex attraction and only focus themselves on opposite sex attraction. For others who have a low level, or no level attractions to the ooposite sex this would be impossible. Leaving the choice of following their attraction or being abstinent. (what I am sure is the wish of most christians).\n \n (secondly) Most importantly I agree with the first article. If it is found to be genetic, it makes no justification as to wehther or not it should be accepted as positive or negative behavior. It could be found that criminal activity is genetic, but we wouldn't want people acting on it. Comes down to positives and negatives. If the behavior proven to be genetic is positive than we should act on it, if it is negative than we should expect people not to act on it. In the end we are back where we started. Is homosexuality a positive or a negative? One group says one thing and the other group says the opposite. Just like it is now.",
