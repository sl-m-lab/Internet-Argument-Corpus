Why did I think of such a stupid idea!?!?!\" :xbanghead (after giving great wealth to over two million people).

For argument sake, Christianity (aren't I biased?) ;) From the Bible we read that man is in rebellion against God. Therefore, various people start their own religions to try to avoid being answerable (and accountable) to this one true God (or possibly for fame and being pampered and other reasons). The words in brackets would be the reason for zachvac creating his religion if he was half serious. My friends sometimes joke about creating their own religion where at least one of them says something to the extent of \"I will be God and everyone will worship me\" and your usual garbage. I really wonder why they are my friends sometimes... emoticon_xclown \n \n (just kidding, they are generally all pretty cool).",
