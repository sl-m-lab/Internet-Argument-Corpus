   "Britain's attorney general Lord Goldsmith urges European Court on Human Rights to review its absolute bar on deporting people to the countries where they may be sentenced to death. He made national security a priority. \n \n This drives me to the conclusion that some foreigners living in Britain do pose some threat to Britain's national security!\n \n I think this all ado is mainly about two imigrants of Russian origin. They are Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Zakaev. Both are said to be linked to Chechen terrorists. But Berezovsky's definitely figure of a bigger caliber. Some time ago I came across amazing reports in the Net covering his activities in far away Central Asia to bring his prophets to key positions in politics and economy. They say he was no stranger to killing of a Kazakh opposition leader Sarsenbaev (spelling may be different). The man is really mighty and experiences no lack of funds to put his risky plans to reality. It's high time the man was sent back to Russia. The same it is with Zakaev. Let'em be her big headache, not that of ours!",

   "Basically, if anyone seeks refuge in the UK I have basic sympathy. If they are trying to escape from crimes such as rape murder & the like then ship them back. If they face the death penalty for their crimes, tough.\n \n If they seek political refuge or come for other reasons, then they stay as long as they behave themselves, if not ship them back again.",
