Gordon Liddy:\n \nAyers is an extreme figure. But then again so is G. Gordon Liddy, the former White House \"plumber\" and Watergate burglar. On behalf of the Nixon administration he masterminded a break-in at the office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist and managed a 20-year prison sentence only because his most far-fetched schemes (including kidnapping anti-war protestors and bombing the Brookings Institution) never came to fruition. Liddy's sentence was commuted by Jimmy Carter, and since that time he's built a career as a radio host. McCain has appeared on Liddy's show and congratulated him for his \"continued success and adherence to the principles and philosophies that keep our nation great.\" Are we supposed to hold McCain accountable for this association?\n\n http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200810u/obama-ayers/2",
