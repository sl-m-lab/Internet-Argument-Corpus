However, I believe that parents have a right to choose, within reasonable parameters, the sort of education their children receive, and that they have the right to use this curriculum free from interference by the state. Certainly, a teacher who sincerely believes in this curriculum, and sells it or promotes it, is within their rights and acting in accordance with what I would consider ethical boundaries. While a teacher who doesn't agree with the curriculum, and even opposes its use in the public school system, shows what an unprincipaled sort of individual they are -- that is, willing to compromise on what they really think for the sake of money and/or their idea of fame. Still, we live in a free society, meaning that even teachers are allowed to prostitute themselves. So, IMO, there is a principle at stake in terms of their individual liberties in (b). Therefore, I chose (c). Teachers who spy on parents and children, while teaching things they don't believe in, and abusing a position of trust, are the worst skunks.

A separate person, who is apparently a teacher (or at least someone with a state education department), is spying on these home-schoolers. The home-schoolers are being spied upon because they are considered enemies of the state. The home-schoolers are considered enemies of the state because they use a creationist curriculum.\n Is this the scenario you're trying to present?\n \n If these people are considered enemies of the state, the education department would not be the people performing the surveillance.\n \n If any department of the government is surveilling a home-schooler, is it being done in a way differently than it would to public school teachers?

Each state has its own laws for homeschoolers whereby they are directly accountable to the school districts they reside in. Usually, too, assessment overseen by licensed teachers.\n \n So assume that the spying is non-specifically goal related, involving a mish-mash of state licensed teachers and employees, with a range of personal and politically motivated self-serving ambitions. \n \n For, otherwise, why indeed would a teacher who subscribes to evolutionary biology be promoting creationist biology curriculum? And why would others professing the same Darwinian views be helping them in their endeavors here?\n \n I guess the catch here, in (c), is that the state licensed teacher is misrepresenting themselves to the parents in some respect, and abusing their trust. The parents think they're getting someone who supports creationist biology curriculum. The state licensed teacher/s supporting them, supporting this activity as ethical.\n \n The teacher doing so is commercially benefiting in some respect.
