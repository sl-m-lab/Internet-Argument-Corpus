An expert on Hitler's Third Reich, he had been invited by courageous students to address an ancient University association in the Austrian capital.\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=6917\n \n http://www.guardian.co.uk/secondworldwar/story/0,14058,1645409,00.html\n \n http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4446646.stm\n \n Irving Faces Twenty Years in Austrian Prison\n \n World War II expert and revisionist historian David Irving is facing a whopping twenty years in an Austrian prison for speaking, it was announced today (November 17, 2005). Such a sentence could amount to life in prison, as Mr. Irving is in his mid-sixties.\n \n Irving was detained on a 1989 warrant alleging that he violated the Alpine nation's draconian hate laws, which makes even discussion of the extent of the Jewish \"holocaust\" a crime.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=6927\n \n \n Related Thread:\n \n Siegfried Verbeke Arrested for \"Denying\" the Holocaust\n \n \n \n \n .",
