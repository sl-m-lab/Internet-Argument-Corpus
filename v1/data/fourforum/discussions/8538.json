No formal charges are levied in the 28-page report, but the government is cited for not enacting hate crime laws to protect gays from being targeted for murder, assault and rape. \n \n \n The report says the allegations represent \"substantive violations\" of the International Covenant for Civil & Political Rights, which protects equal rights, freedom of expression and other liberties. \n \n \n Global Rights, Amnesty International, gay groups including the Human Rights Campaign and other report participants ask the U.N. Human Rights Committee to hold the U.S. responsible for these \"human rights violations.\" \n \n \n The report's release came the same week that U.N. Human Rights Committee members in Geneva questioned U.S. officials about the nation's track record on human rights issues. \n \n \n Global Rights spokesperson Mark Bromley said the July 17-18 meeting was the first such inquiry into alleged U.S. rights abuses by the U.N. since 1995. \n \n Although the inquiry focused on war-related issues, like the handling of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Bromley said the U.S. was forced by one committee member to respond to problems documented in the report on gay issues. \n \n \n According to partial transcripts of the inquiry, Justice Department spokesperson Wan Kim noted the U.S. maintains a \"profound and lasting commitment to equality.\" \n \n \n The U.S. delegation's leader, State Department spokesperson Matthew Waxman admitted, \"There is always more work to be done to safeguard human rights,\" but he otherwise did not address gay rights issues. \n \n \n Most gay rights questions came from U.N. committee member Michael O'Flaherty of Ireland. Bromley said O'Flaherty asked U.S. officials to describe their plans to combat employment discrimination, and protect transgender people. \n \n \n Kim responded that the government \"takes all kinds of violence - against all victims - very seriously,\" no matter who was victimized or \"what they look like.\" \n \n \n Bromley said that gay rights issues were addressed during the inquiry, which demonstrates the report's influence. \n \n \n \"I think we recognized from the outset that given the unique set of issues - with respect to the so-called war on terrorism, and the whole range of terrorism, torture, Guantanamo issues - it was going to be quite difficult to make room for less well known and more domestically focused issues,\" Bromley said. \"We were quite pleased that these questions were raised.\" \n \n \n 'Major gaps' in protections \n \n \n The report - titled \"Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender & Intersex Human Rights in the United States\" - alleges several \"major gaps\" in protections for gay Americans. \n \n \n It chides the U.S. for failing to enact any \"standardized non-discrimination protections based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.\" \n \n \n Also missing in 21 states and federal code are hate crime statutes that cover real or perceived sexual orientation. \n \n \n \"The failure of many states and the federal government to add sexual orientation to the categories of bias motivated hate crimes,\" the report says, \"creates the impression that those crimes are less serious than other bias motivated crimes.\" \n \n \n Several \"human rights violations\" are also alleged in the report. \n \n The military's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy, which bars open gays from military service, is cited as one such violation. The report classified the policy as \"a discriminatory limitation on freedom of expression.\" \n \n \n The report says the U.S. is also failing to protect gay and lesbian youth. It describes a \"prevalence of verbal, physical, and sexual violence\" directed toward these youths. \n \n \n The report describes many other instances where gays are perceived or treated as second-class citizens. \n \n \n In one example, the report describes how some assaults on gays are being rationalized in U.S. courts through the so-called \"gay panic defense.\" \n \n \n \"The defendant often claims that he was animated by fear of a perceived sexual advance,\" the report says. \"This defense has been effective in mitigating punishments in a number of hate crimes cases, and it appears most effective when jurors manifest similar levels of bias against the victim.\" \n \n \n Angela Clements, an HRC public policy advocate, said the report proves that U.S. officials must do more to protect gays. \n \n \n \"Clearly,\" she said, \"there's a lot of work to do.\" \n \n \n The U.N. Human Rights Committee is expected to release its recommendations to the U.S. later this month. Those recommendations carry symbolic weight and are not legally binding. \n \n \n \"There's a sense that the committee will issue a fairly strong rebuke,\" Bromley said, \"but whether the U.S. will take it to heart is another question.\"\n",

   "I'm happy to see that the inadequate protections for gays and lesbians hasn't gone unnoticed. I doubt the U.S. will do anything in response to this inquiry. They should just be honest and say that we have a bunch of right wing religious fanatics here that would be enraged if protections for gays and lesbians came to reality. The country touts itself as the best country on earth but lacks terribly in this area, we look like a 3rd world country when it comes to equal protections for the GLBT community. I used to think we were the leader in the world, that's obviously a ridiculous thought, I now realize.",
