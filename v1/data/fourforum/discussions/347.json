Pro-Life people look at the limited evidence, like the early appearance of the physical characteristics of human beings in the fetus, and they say \"the glass is half full\", jumping to the conclusion that there is a human soul there. Pro-Choice people look at the same evidence and say \"the glass is half-empty\", and there is no human person there. Science cannot prove the ABSENCE of human souls any more than it can prove their presence. This entitles BOTH SIDES to believe whatever they choose (on grounds other than RATIONAL PROOF), but it doesn't entitle them to use politics to impose their views through legislation on others. \n \n If people believe that God is all knowing and that the Bible is God's Word, how do they explain the fact that neither the God of the Old Testament nor Jesus used even ONE of the 31,173 verses of the Bible to tell the world that abortion is the killing of a human being ? \n Was it because God didn't know that human life begins at conception? \n God didn't know that abortions were being performed from ancient times (with herbs and the like)? \n God didn't know or care that, without CLEAR condemnations of this practice, billions of innocent human beings over the centuries would be killed and billions of adults would be murderers themselves, or accessories to murder? \n God was squeamish about sex? \n God didn't have the courage it takes to attack popular sins? \n \n Why do Americans allow some people to transform an issue which is not even MENTIONED in the Hebrew or the Christian Bibles into THE SINGLE MOST PRESSING MORAL ISSUE OF OUR TIME?",

   "The Roe v. Wade decision was predicated on two suppositions: the assumption that the fetus was not a \"person,\" and the assumption that a woman's right to privacy included the liberty to terminate her pregnancy on demand. The Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment declares that no state shall \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\" \n Because the personhood of the fetus was so critical to the outcome of the case, the outstanding question during the Roe hearings was \"when does life begin?\" That question, however, was not resolved and instead, setting it aside, the Roe Court assumed that the fetus was not a \"person,\" and handed down a decision saying that \"[i]f this suggestion of personhood is established, [Roe's] case, of course, collapses, for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the [14th] Amendment.\" Because of this clause, Roe should be reexamined. \n \n In 1981, internationally known geneticists and biologists addressed the question of when life begins in a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing. Dr. Micheline M. Mathews-Roth, of Harvard Medical School, gave testimony, supported by reference from over 20 embryology and other medical textbooks, that human life began at conception. Dr. Jerome Lejeune, the \"Father of Modern Genetics,\" testified: \"To accept the fact that after fertilization has taken place a new human has come into being is no longer a matter of taste or opinion ... it is plain experimental evidence.\" Dr. McCarthy de Mere, a medical doctor and University of Tennessee law professor, testified: \"The exact moment of the beginning of personhood and of the human body is at the moment of conception.\" \n \"Calling human beings \"embryos\" or \"fetuses\" serves the same purpose as calling them \"adolescents\" or \"adults.\" These scientific terms are used to indicate where a person is in his or her development. They were never meant to imply that the unborn child is not human. As the \"infant\" is different from the \"adolescent\" in terms of development and dependence, so the \"fetus\" is different from the \"infant.\" Yet all are genetically human, and therefore persons.\" ~From Language of Illusion: The Abortion Slogans \n At conception, all 46 human chromosomes are present, beginning a unique human life. Twenty one days later, the fetus' heart is pumping the baby's own blood through a closed circulatory system. Brain waves can be recorded 42 days, or six weeks, after conception. By eight weeks, although still weighing less than one ounce all body systems are present. Eighteen weeks after conception, the baby can turn somersaults, grasp objects with his hands, dream, and cry. At 25 weeks, 79 % of babies survive a premature birth. From the start, this life is clearly not just a part of the mother, but an individual person entitled to the rights of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. \n \n Justice Rehnquist wrote in his dissent to Roe:\n \"I have difficulty in concluding... that the right to \"privacy\" is involved in this case.... A transaction resulting in an operation such as [an abortion] is not \"private\" in the ordinary usage of that word. Nor is the \"privacy\" that the Court finds here even a distant relative of the freedom from searches and seizures protected by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, which the Court has referred to as embodying a right to privacy.\"\n \n Unenumerated rights cannot take precedent over enumerated rights; a child's right to life preempts a woman's \"right\" to an abortion. Because abortion involves the purposeful termination of human life, it must be recognized as different in kind from other \"privacy\" rights protected in earlier cases.",

That there is no question of. \n \n I still, however, believe in two things that still make me keep my views. \n \n 1. Mental & social health is just as important as physical health. It is a nature vs. nurture argument. I personally believe that if a baby is going to be aborted the mother is not ready/able to take care of it. How many Albert Einsteins have come from single mother families with young mothers who didn't want the child? Now, how many murderers/rapists/gang leaders, etc. have come from these households? Even if one does have a right to life, one would think, what kind of life is one where you are not wanted?\n \n 2. Judging from your attempt to persuade me, I would venture to guess that you are pro-life. I am, obviously pro-choice, but not because I believe that a broken condom is a reason to kill a fetus. As stated before, I have pretty high standards to meet before I would even consider aborting a child inside me.

Abortion doesn't solve a mother's problems of any kind.

In an abortion, the person who dies has not done anything to \"merit\" death. In the case of rape, abortion is killing the wrong person. The rapist, not the child, should be executed. In the area you are struggling with, I'll tell you a true story. In very early American history, (I think it was in the 1600s) a woman killed her child as soon as it was born by smashing it against the floor. She was convicted of murder, sentenced, and executed. Abortion is the same thing, dispite the fact that it is now called a \"safe and legal\" procedure, and is performed in a hospital or clinic.

There is more to life than simply being alive. Maybe you don't realize it, but people in other countries HAVE to kill their babies, or give them up to starvation. Wouldn't you rather that a seven year old child die of painful starvation, or be aborted while still a fetus? Sure, in America and other first world countries we don't have as much of a problem, but can you honesly say that each and every child born in a first world country has a garuantee of even a halfway decent life? Sometimes, abortion is more of a mercy killing than murder. \n \n \"The parents should take responsibility and not have sex\" That's a very wonderful idea, and in a perfect world, I would agree. However, if you haven't noticed, we are far from a perfect world, and that theory applied only leads to more trouble. How would you like to go through life knowing you were an unwanted mistake? And don't think that parents will \"instantly love their child and regret ever thinking of abortion\". Welcome to the real world. People can be mean and ugly, and they won't hesitate to get rid of a baby any way possible, including killing it. Even if they don't kill the baby and give it up for adoption, imagine the huge influx of babies from people if everyone who was pro-life got their way, and made abortion illegal. What is the system supposed to do with them? And if a woman is raped? Sure, the baby didn't do anything wrong, and so therefore shouldn't be punished, but should you also punish the mother every day of the rest of her life by reminding her about that baby? By not letting her let go of it, by saying 'too bad. You have to keep the baby, because killing it is a crime, but punishing you for the man's crime isn't\"? While I myself would not abort a child simply because I was irresponsible, I am not God, and I won't impose my morals on other people, who live a different life than I do, that have different experiences than I do.

The government cannot force religious beliefs or morals on the people.\"\n \n Silent Poet,\n \"- The government does have the authority to stop murder. This is the main prospect of abortion. The government does have a right to restrict murder because it violates the rights of others.\"\n \n I agree, Silent Poet, the government does have the authority to stop murder. Are we or are we not debating whether abortion is or is not murder??? \"...restrict murder because it violates the rights of others.\"\n \n What about women's rights? As a woman I want the right to choose what's best for my body. I want the right to remove an unwanted clump of cells from my body. I want the right to remove an unwanted mole (clump of cells) surgically. Is that murder? (Refer to the definition of murder posted.) I want the right to remove a benign (clump of cells) or cancerous tumor (clump of cells). Is that murder? I want the right to remove unwanted fat cells surgically. Is that murder? I want the right to donate a kidney (clump of cells) to a loved one. Is that murder? All of the above is considered acceptable by our society. Therefore, I should have the right to remove any type of unwanted clump of cells from my body including an embryo (clump of cells) or fetus (clump of cells). Is that murder? From my perspective it's not.\n \n The point. All of the before mentioned clumps of cells are not human beings. \n \n \"Life is a state of a cell or organism characterized by capacity for metabolism, growth, reaction to stimuli, and reproduction. A fetus is life, just as an embryo, a sperm, an ant, an acorn, and a tree, are all life. All these forms of life have no rights. The characteristic of life is necessary to possess rights, but it alone is insufficient.\n \n Characteristic of a human being: independent physiological existence. A fetus is human, in the sense that it contains human DNA; however, a fetus, like an embryo, is not a human being, as it has no means of independent physiological existence (as does a baby, child, or adult). As such, it is a potential human being, just like an acorn is a potential oak tree. It contains all of the DNA of an oak tree, but it is not an oak tree.\" http://www.abortionisprolife.com\n \n I would venture to say that most anti-abortion activist allow their emotions, morals, personal beliefs, and religions to fuel their debates. When debating whether or not abortion should be legal one cannot allow religion or personal beliefs into the equation. Our laws and government are not governed by religion. Society must respect everyone's personal beliefs from atheists to Christians. But keep in mind just because some people are pro-abortion does not mean that they are atheists.\n \n The laws govern human rights. Society must decide whether or not an embryo or fetus is a human being or not. If it's not then it doesn't have human rights by law. Therefore, abortion is not murder. \n \n signed,\n avoiceofreason\n \n http://www.abortionisprolife.com",

Good sex is part of a good relationship. \n \n \n Poet, \n What is your definition of a \"relationship?\" Is it a life-long committment in marriage, a boyfriend-girlfriend dating period...and how narrow is your definition of a strong/good relationship? Do you propose that sex is a necessity or simply one component of a good relationship? That is, would a good relationship be one that is good enough to survive even without the good sex? Say your partner gets paralzyed and loses sexual function. Is your relationship good enough to stay? Maybe they get a traumatic brain injury and their leg muscles tighten up so much that they can't have sex. Is there still a good relationship? So can a young or old relationship have physical attraction while abstaining from sex and still be strong/good? \n \n I think Gilligan is the voice of failure and cynicism when he states that premarital sex is an inevitability. If you are a parent then you are creating a self-fulfilling prophecy for your kids that will bring on serious consequences. \n \n Just some semi-random thoughts.",

   "Maximus,\n I agree the zygote/embryo/fetus/baby has a distinct and separate genetic code establishing it as an entity different from its mother. This only proves that it is a living organism. The fetus is a part of the mother. It is a parasite living off the mother's nutrients just like a tapeworm. A zygote/embryo/fetus or tapeworm are living organisms, neither are human beings; they act as parasites.\n \n \"The fetus is physically within the mother and connected to her via the placenta and umbilical chord. It is directly physically dependent on the mother for all of its life sustaining needs-oxygen, energy and safety from the external environment. The relationship between mother and fetus is not that of two distinct human entities, but rather that of an independent human being (the mother) with rights and a dependent physical appendage, something that is physically within and part of the mother and therefore cannot have individual rights.\n \n Individual rights cannot be granted to the parts of human entities-to do so would make a surgeon a murderer when he removes a healthy kidney from a patient for an organ transplant, an internist a murderer when he poisons a tapeworm to achieve its removal from a patient's intestine, a dermatologist a killer when he removes a mole from a patient's face.\" Richard G. Parker, MD runs Objectivist Issues in Medicine (OIM). Richard G. Parker, MD is an Objectivist emergency physician in Dallas, Texas.\n \n \n The issue of abortion is dependent on the law that governs the people. We must establish who has rights the mother or the zygote/embryo/fetus. Human beings are granted rights qua man's status as a rational animal, not a qua animal.\n \n \"The essential distinction between man and all other animals is his rational faculty and it is this quality which confers political rights. In other words, man has rights by virtue of \"rational living entity,\" not by virtue of \"living entity.\"\n Most (if not all) animals move and have sensations. The view that the unborn fetus has rights because of its ability to move and sense, by logical extension, is tantamount to arguing that all animals (and some plants) have rights. In other words, if you ate steak and potatoes yesterday you are a co-conspirator in murder and a cannibal.\n The basis for individual rights lies in man's nature as a rational animal, as a living being with a volitional consciousness (free will). The concept of individual rights can therefore only be properly understood in the context of a RATIONAL INDEPENDENT ENTITY, not in the context of a living thing with rudimentary sensations.\" Richard G. Parker, MD runs Objectivist Issues in Medicine (OIM). Richard G. Parker, MD is an Objectivist emergency physician in Dallas, Texas.\n \n So, if a pro-lifer can prove that a zygote/embryo/fetus is a rational independent entity then and only then will they have rights by law. Otherwise, to give rights to a zygote/embryo/fetus means you are giving rights to a living organism who is not a rational independent entity. This in turn will condemn a major part of the population who would now be found guilty of murder for eating a plant or animal, which are both living organisms.\n \n Furthermore, if rights are given to living organisms (zygote/embryo/fetus) will women who've had a miscarriage be charged with attempted murder? Will they be charged for pre-meditated murder because their body conspired to commit murder with pre-meditated intent by aborting the zygote/embryo/fetus? Will these women be called down to the local police station and interrogated for lifting an object that clearly their gynecologist told them not to lift for risk of miscarriage? Will the gynecologist's record be used in a court of law because it clearly states on their patient records that they were foreworned to not lift heavy objects? etc. I think you get the point.\n \n To answer your question in regards to:\n \"If independent physiologic existence is the requirement for personhood does a person requiring mechanical ventilation for a short period of time lose his rights? There are quite a few more examples of this across age groups.\n \n The theory of life and independence being the requisites for personhood and rights is faulty.\" Maximus\n Once again a human being has rights because they are a rational independent entity. When a human being requires mechanical ventilation they do not stop being a rational independent entity. Therefore, they still have rights. For a human being to choose whether they want mechanical ventilation or not does depend on wither they have decision-making capacity or not.\n \n \"The principle of patient autonomy requires that physicians respect the decision to forego life-sustaining treatment of a patient who possesses decision-making capacity. Life-sustaining treatment is any treatment that serves to prolong life without reversing the underlying medical condition. Life-sustaining treatment may include, but is not limited to, mechanical ventilation, renal dialysis, chemotherapy, antibiotics, and artificial nutrition and hydration.\n A competent, adult patient may, in advance, formulate and provide a valid consent to the withholding or withdrawal of life-support systems in the event that injury or illness renders that individual incompetent to make such a decision. A patient may also appoint a surrogate decision maker in accordance with state law. \" American Medical Association\n REFERENCES:\n http://www.abortionisprolife.com/\n http://www.ama-assn.org/\n http://capmag.com/article.asp?ID=2160\n \n For those with religious beliefs that choose to bring your morals into this debate, may I remind you that pro-abortion activists support your first ammendment rights. Is it too much to ask that you support women's rights to choose?\n \n THE FIRST AMENDMENT \"Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\"",

   "Originally posted by avoiceofreason \n Maximus,\n I agree the zygote/embryo/fetus/baby has a distinct and separate genetic code establishing it as an entity different from its mother. This only proves that it is a living organism. The fetus is a part of the mother. It is a parasite living off the mother's nutrients just like a tapeworm. A zygote/embryo/fetus or tapeworm are living organisms, neither are human beings; they act as parasites.\n \n \"The fetus is physically within the mother and connected to her via the placenta and umbilical chord. It is directly physically dependent on the mother for all of its life sustaining needs-oxygen, energy and safety from the external environment. The relationship between mother and fetus is not that of two distinct human entities, but rather that of an independent human being (the mother) with rights and a dependent physical appendage, something that is physically within and part of the mother and therefore cannot have individual rights.\n \n Individual rights cannot be granted to the parts of human entities-to do so would make a surgeon a murderer when he removes a healthy kidney from a patient for an organ transplant, an internist a murderer when he poisons a tapeworm to achieve its removal from a patient's intestine, a dermatologist a killer when he removes a mole from a patient's face.\" Richard G. Parker, MD runs Objectivist Issues in Medicine (OIM). Richard G. Parker, MD is an Objectivist emergency physician in Dallas, Texas.\"\n \n \n Voice of reason,\n You contradict yourself. You state in the 1st sentence that you agree the \"being\" is a different entity than its mother as established by separate genetic code. Then in the 2nd sentence you state that the separate entity is a part of the mother. \n \n Then you say, \"A zygote/embryo/fetus or tapeworm are living organisms, neither are human beings.\" If the zygote/embryo/fetus has the genetic code of a human then how does it suddenly become a different species? It is human as established by genetic code. It is living as established by growth and development.\n \n The points above establish why removing a fetus/embryo/zygote is not like removing a kidney, mole, tapeworm. It is the removal of a distinct albeit dependent human life. The being is not a part of a human entity but a distinct human entity.\n \n Now, does the being's dependence on the mother forfeit its rights? If so then does an 80 year old helpless grandmother, a down-syndrome adolescent, a 2 week old birthed baby lose their rights?\n \n Does the dominance of the mother over the being negate its rights? One can use the same examples as above.\n \n Does the location or proximity of the being forfeit its rights? Do you forfeit your rights when you go into someone else's home?",

   "Originally posted by avoiceofreason \n Maximus,\n The issue of abortion is dependent on the law that governs the people. We must establish who has rights the mother or the zygote/embryo/fetus. Human beings are granted rights qua man's status as a rational animal, not a qua animal.\n \n \"The essential distinction between man and all other animals is his rational faculty and it is this quality which confers political rights. In other words, man has rights by virtue of \"rational living entity,\" not by virtue of \"living entity.\"\n Most (if not all) animals move and have sensations. The view that the unborn fetus has rights because of its ability to move and sense, by logical extension, is tantamount to arguing that all animals (and some plants) have rights. In other words, if you ate steak and potatoes yesterday you are a co-conspirator in murder and a cannibal.\n The basis for individual rights lies in man's nature as a rational animal, as a living being with a volitional consciousness (free will).

   "Voice of reason,\n Sorry for yet another post but you did bring up quite a few issues in your post.\n \n 1.http://www.abortionisprolife.com/ -- I think they are in the habit of calling evil good.\n \n 2.\"Abortion is a moral right-which should be left to the sole discretion of the woman involved; morally, nothing other than her wish in the matter is to be considered. Who can conceivably have the right to dictate to her what disposition she is to make of the functions of her body?\" - Ayn Rand \n The problem is that pregnancy is not a function of the woman's body brought about solely by the woman. It is a state that protects and develops a product of two people--a man and a woman. (Another proof that the fetus is not a part of the mother).\n Yet a man has no say in the matter. He cannot save his child if he wants to. And most accuse the pro-lifers of being inconsiderate. Ayn Rand's quote sounds pretty selfish to me.\n \n 3. RE: THE FIRST AMENDMENT \"Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\"\n \n The DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain UNALIENABLE Rights, that among these are LIFE, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" THE FIRST OF THESE IS LIFE! \"That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes DESTRUCTIVE of these ends, it is the RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO ALTER OR TO ABOLISH IT, AND TO INSTITUTE NEW GOVERNMENT, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their SAFETY AND HAPPINESS.\" \n \n 4. \"The issue of abortion is dependent on the law that governs the people.\" No issue is dependent on the law to the point that it goes unchallenged or unquestioned. The law does not govern, people govern. The law is made by people. In the instance of abortion, a few people sitting on the supreme court. The law does not tell you that rape or murder or anything else is immoral. If rape and murder was legal than it would not become moral. It would remain detestable, cruel and immoral.",

   "Poet, \n I agree with you on many points. We agree that making abortion illegal might cut down on the number of abortions because it would discourage some from having them. We agree that the best place for children is in a home with two loving parents. We agree that sex can make a relationship stronger. We agree though that sex is not a necessity that the couple cannot do without. (I think I have gotten all of this correct so far).\n \n Would you also agree that decreasing the number of people having sex in times when they are not ready for children might also cut down on the number of abortions? Maybe this is not the entire solution but it is a reasonable start. I think this was the point Habbit was trying to make although I am not trying to speak for him/her. Perhaps, Habbit was not saying that you should only have sex when you want a child but that you should only have sex if you are accepting of a child. Gilligan conceded that children are the natural fruit of sex sometimes even when various birth control interventions are used to prevent this. So maybe people have sex due to love or due to the desire to achieve that stronger relationship. Kids are not their aim. But kids are a known result of the sexual act. So, whether you use birth control methods that fail or do not use anything, if you are having sex then should you be accepting of the natural consequence of your actions, the natural fruit of the sexual act?\n \n You and Gilligan look at the issue as an observation of the whole and say that people will have sex no matter what. There will always be people having sex. I concede that this may well be a current fact but not an immutable, eternal fact. It can change. I think that your suggestion is that we need other ways to deal with the fruit of sex than abstinence due to the fact that there will always be people having sex. But how do we deal with this on a practical level? \n \n Let's say you are a parent and your kid is reaching the age of adolescence. Do you tell him that he has no chance to resist the physical urges of his body and that he/she should go out and do what all people do? Or do you not say anything to your child about sex and let him figure it out on his own with the possibility that he will meet kids having sex and think that all kids do it? On a practical level this will become a dangerous self-fulfilling prophecy that I spoke of to Gilligan. I am guessing that you would say that neither of the above options would be the best parenting. Let's go to the next step. You may tell your kid that sex is \"natural\" but he should use a condom or birth control pill (which I propose makes the sex not very \"natural\" but these are semantics for a different thread). Again this can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Maybe this advice will protect them a little bit more than an outright reckless apathy or encouragement of unprotected sex though. But as we have established sometimes even these methods do not prevent pregnancy (or STDs). So what is the best advice a parent can give to his child about sex outside of a permanent, committed relationship? I propose it is abstinence. So what is the best path to lead people to achieve this type of relationship? Can you agree that abstinence is not the only method but definitely the best method in practical terms of negating peer pressure and preventing STD, unwanted pregnancy, emotional baggage, and even abortion? What is the best path to lead your child on that will show him the idea that you already have-that the best place for a child is in a home with two loving parents? I cannot think of any adverse side effects of abstinence. It is fullproof. Until you and PARENTS see this as the most appropriate method on a practical level then it will continue to be an ideal that is not a possibility. But if you realize its potential as the best method of protection and prevention then it can become a reality. \n \n Finally, you may ask how this applies to the millions of adults having sex who have no parents to instruct them. I have two points in this matter. 1. Kids practicing abstinence will grow up into adults practicing abstinence. (continuing to prevent abortion) 2. Should we tell kids to practice abstinence (established as the best protection against unwanted babies and STDs) if we as adults are not practicing abstinence?\n \n I have reserved the \"Christian moral onslaught\" from this post because it seems like some have a reactionary awareness of anything that hints of faith. But if you look at things in practical terms, Christianity works. I'm not saying that this is the reason one should believe but rather that there is a harmony of things as a side effect of proper Christian practice and understanding. The harmony and peace is tangible. It saves people a lot of pain, distress, and heartache.\n \n Peace",

I now realize that my wording posed a contradiction.\n \n RE: Your statements on celibacy...You say that we are genetically wired to have sex then you say that celibates have a difficult time passing on \"traits\" to others that promote celibacy. It seems that you mean that celibate mean cannot pass on their celibate genetics because they are not reproducing. But I thought you said that we were genetically wired for sex? Are some genetically wired for celibacy? Is that how they do it? \n I don't think so. I never said that abstinence was easy. But the difficulty of some task or philosophy does not establish it as impossible or ineffective. I would guess that most teens do not fail at abstinence because it is difficult. They fail because they have been sold the lie of safe sex, the lie of the self-fulfilling prophecy of \"sex is natural,\" because their parents do not take the time or effort to tell them why waiting for sex is beneficial. I think that celibates are able to remain that way due to a lack of ego-centrism. They see something beyond themselves. And in the Christian philosophy they give themselves for others just as Christ did (whether it be in marriage or the priesthood). Maybe we can start a new thread on this one!!\n \n Does the fact that we are genetically wired to have sex mean that we cannot resist the urge? Does the fact that resisting the urge is difficult mean that we cannot do it? Does the fact that we are genetically wired to eat mean that we cannot resist the urge? Does the fact that we are genetically wired to sleep mean that we cannot resist the urge? (this comparison breaks down due to the fact that sex is not necessary for the survival of the individual as are some of the other \"urges\") But the question is not whether we have the ability to resist the urge but rather, \"What are the benefits of resisting that urge?\" I established the benefits in my last post. Of course I left out a few: less risk of cervical cancer for women, departure from the encouragement of lack of committment in men and women due to establishing a pattern of instant gratification/physical intimacy lacking emotional intimacy, increased chance of infidelity in other relationships...Face it, after the 1960s sexual revolution and the introduction of the pill, condoms, and every other method of contraception the teen sex rate has risen decade after decade. The government saw that it was getting out of hand and they saw what effect it would have on the stability of society. So they introduce sex education in school with a major emphasis on safe sex and encouragement of contraceptives. The rate continued to increase and STDs like HPV went out of the roof. So then in the 90s the government began to sponsor abstinence programs. For the first time since the 60s boom the rate actually went down--practical and effective.\n \n \"What child can ever observe their parents practicing perfect celibacy?\" Do you mean perfect celibacy or absolute celibacy? Or did you simply mean periodic abstinence? Why would parents need to practice absolute celibacy? If married, they are in that stable, committed relationship that is the best place to raise children. But I will give a shot to provide examples of abstinence in a marriage:\n \n 1. Father dies, mother devotes herself to children, loves no other for the rest of her life due to the extraordinary love she had for her husband, a devoted celibate\n \n 2. Mother dies, father falls in love again, waits until marriage before having sex, he discusses why he does this with his kids\n \n 3. Father is injured and loses sexual function (a Christopher Reeve type thing--although I cannot speak about C. Reeve's sexual function, some with spinal cord injuries can, some cannot), wife remains with him faithfully--kids see that parents love is not based on sex\n \n 4. Dad has a broken hip, sex would hurt, mom has the ability and committment to wait for him to get better\n \n 5. Mom just had a baby and an episiotomy, can't have sex for awhile, dad comforts and pampers her\n \n 6. Mom and Dad wait until marriage to have sex, they tell their kids about it to influence their sexual decisions\n \n 7. My wife and I are periodically abstinent for a few weeks a month when there are serious reasons for post-poning pregnancy (via Natural Family Planning)",

   "Chai-\n \n \nThere are people who wait to have kids because the financial situation's just not right, or they want to get farther in their career before settling down. There are a million reasons why married couples will use birth control.\n\n \n Yeah. Um. I think you're smart enough to know what I meant. I never said no couple would ever not have kids, but, tell me of any that say they will never have kids with the expection of it not being possible. By the way, \"There are people who wait to have kids because the financial situation's just not right.\" You're only reinforcing my statement with that quote. The couples want kids, but have decided to wait until their finacial situation becomes better. Once again, I never said that no couple in the world would never want to have kids, but those make up like 5% (exaggeration) of the world's population. \n \n \nAs to the second sentance, aren't you one of the pro-lifers who believe that each and every life is important? Then isn't the aborted fetus of a married couple just as much a victim of murder as an the aborted fetus of a single teenage girl to you?\n\n \n I'm going to start this response off with the same first three sentences in the last one. \"Yeah. Um. I think you're smart enough to know what I meant.\" The majority of women having abortions... are they married women who usually are the ones having babies, or are they single teenage girls who have hundreds of reasons of why they want to abort their baby. \n \n ----\n \n As for SilentPoet's post and Chai's other responses, I think maximus did an excellent job in his posts of what I was going to say.",

   "[QUOTE=maximus]Chai,\n \n My initial impression of you is that you are all BITE and no BARK. :)\n \n Heh heh. I see. It's quite possible. Your points are very valid and if you sincerely want an apology, you've got it. Same goes for Habbit. I have a small problem of arguing issues like this on completely different planes for other people, so while their debating whether its murder or not, my point is that it may very well be murder, but to me, the worse crime is actually having the child and raising it in a world unwanted while the mother doesn't get to go to college (she could, with the baby, I'm not saying that women who have babies can't do college at the same time. My mom went through grad school with my sister and I.) and without things like hope. Then, I get blown away for condoning murder or something along those lines. Or, I will point out that I personally would not have an abortion unless somehow having the baby would kill me, or if the baby would be born with a defect that make it live with a horrible disease that would mean a short life of unending pain, and no, I'm not talking about something like Down(s?) syndrome. I would have the child even if it had Downs. I'm more along the lines of a really bad case of cystic fibrosis. However, I am still pro-choice because I have realized long ago that my moral standards are not neccecarily the only right way, and I don't believe that abortion itself is a horrible thing. Then people will tell me that in fact, I am pro-life. I just wanted to take this last chance to clarify that. I'm getting tired of banging my head against this massive brick wall (I realize that most of you probably feel the same way about me), so I'm getting off of this topic. Adios, amigos.",

   "Chai,\n I was just joking--kind of :). I don't need an apology for the friendly debate of which we have partaken. I have no problem with stern words in debate as long as it's not ad hominem. I throw around strong words too. \n \n Let me get this right. You are saying that growing up in poverty is worse than not growing up at all? Murder (your words) is better?\n \n As far as kids being born with a death sentence due to various supposed painful, torturous, incurable conditions with little life expectancy I have this to say: I work in the medical field and I have first hand knowledge of kids like that living totally different lives than what the doctors predict. They sometimes out live their life expectancy as well. Doctors don't always know what is going to happen. But the problem is that they will not often tell you that they don't know.\n \n You can experience joy and happiness with these kids. And THEY can experience joy and happiness as well as other facets of life. If it's a kid of my own flesh and blood then I want to know that kid--whether it's a few hours, a few days, a few months, or longer. This is not selfishness. I would gamble that he might want to know me and his mother as well. If this thing is a kid then abortion is a horrible thing. I'm not saying this as a condemnation to those who abort but as a regret. They may feel the loss at some time. \n \n Actually your moral standards may be the only right way. There are certain things that are universal. There is objectivity in morality. Don't be afraid of that. \n \n P.S. I hope you continue banging your head. Just plug in some really loud 80s stuff like Quiet Riot or Twisted Sister to make it more fun.\n \n Peace.",
