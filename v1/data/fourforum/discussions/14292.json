   "A pretty balanced article on this issue, and why the ban is being reconsidered. Personally, I think the ban is outdated, myself. Detection technology is extremely good these days. I've had a blood transfusion myself before, and cannot imagine anyone being concerned about this these days. I can see both sides to this, but the reality is that someone could get HIV from a straight person's blood too.\n \n \"Under Food and Drug Administration rules, men who have had sex -- even once -- with another man since 1977 are not permitted to give blood. The rule was implemented in 1983, sparked by concerns that HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, was tainting the blood supply. Screening tests to identify HIV-positive blood had not been developed. The policy was seen as a safety measure.\n \n But today, with the availability of more accurate testing, activists, blood organizations and several U.S. senators say the lifetime ban is \"medically and scientifically unwarranted\" and are calling for change.\n \n The Federal Advisory Committee on Blood Safety and Availability will consider the issue in meetings June 10 and 11 in Rockville, Maryland. The committee makes recommendations to the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA.\n \n Medical opinions vary; some experts say that lifting the ban could pose health risks to blood recipients.\n \n The Human Rights Campaign, the American Red Cross, America's Blood Centers and AABB, formerly known as the American Association of Blood Banks, support easing the lifetime ban to allow gay blood donors. In a joint statement, the blood organizations said that safety was the first priority and that potential donors should be screened more fairly, regardless of sexual orientation.\n \n About three months ago, Sen. John Kerry and 17 other senators signed a letter to the FDA blasting its \"outdated\" policy.\n \n Gay men, including those who are in monogamous relationships, are forbidden from contributing blood for the rest of their lives, while \"a heterosexual who has had sex with a prostitute need only wait a year [before giving blood]. That does not strike me as a sound scientific conclusion,\" Kerry wrote in a March 9 letter.\n \n The FDA defended its current policy in an e-mailed statement to CNN.com: The policy, it said, is \"based on scientific data that show that certain medical, behavioral and geographical factors are associated with increased risk of transfusion transmitted diseases.\"\n \n The agency has been \"taking into account the current body of scientific information, and we are considering the possibility of pursuing alternative strategies that maintain blood safety,\" the statement said.\n \n The FDA retained the ban on gay blood donors after reviewing the issue in 2000 and 2006.\n Blood rules\n Other factors that would make an individual ineligible to give blood:\n &#8226; Had leukemia or lymphoma, including Hodgkin's disease and other blood cancers.\n &#8226; Used needles to take drugs, steroids or anything not prescribed by a doctor.\n &#8226; Born or lived in Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Niger or Nigeria since 1977.\n &#8226; Received a tattoo in the past 12 months.\n &#8226; Visited or lived in the United Kingdom for three months or more between 1980 and 1996 because of the risk of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease (mad cow disease).\n \n Source: American Red Cross\n \n Health statistics show that men who have sex with men have a higher rate of diseases including HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B. Gay men who would be likely to donate have an HIV prevalence that is over 15 times higher than that of the general population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n \n \"I do not see this being a gay rights issue,\" said Dr. Jay Brooks, professor of pathology at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, adding that he favors gay marriage and gays serving in the military.\n \n The issue of blood donation has \"nothing to do with someone being gay. Any group that's epidemiologically at risk of making blood unsafe, it's unfortunate. ... It's a matter of epidemiology.\"\n \n The different standards between gay and straight people exists because the risk of HIV is much lower in heterosexuals, he said.\n \n \"The interest of the recipient is greater than any donor,\" Brooks said. \"I'd hate to tell the one person who got HIV through a blood transfusion, 'Sorry, we changed the regulation.' \"\n \n More at Federal ban on gay men's blood donation to be reconsidered - CNN.com\n \n ",

   "Ban upheld on homosexual blood donors\n \n \nGay rights groups said the blood donation policy discriminates against gay and bisexual men. They point out a heterosexual man or a woman having sex with an HIV-positive partner is restricted from giving blood for one year from that contact, while gay men face a lifetime ban. \n \n The HHS committee listened to often-emotional testimony from people supporting ending the ban and those pushing the status quo or more incremental change. \n \n Nathan Schaefer of the Gay Men&#8217;s Health Crisis, an HIV/AIDS organization, said most gay men practice safe sex and are HIV-negative, and should be considered a low-risk donor group. The HIV/AIDS organization, which has pushed for revised rules, noted Italy and Spain screen for high-risk behaviors rather than sexual orientation. \n \n And Lee Storrow, a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told the committee that he gave blood in high school. Now, after having sex with a male, he can no longer donate, he said. &#8220;I hope I can one day donate blood again,&#8217;&#8217; Storrow said. \n \n The Red Cross and other blood-collection organizations support a one-year &#8221;deferral,&#8221; or waiting period, on donations after male-to-male sex, saying the current ban is scientifically unwarranted.\n \n A one-year deferral period on blood donations by men who have had sex with another man would yield an estimated 89,000 additional pints annually, according to a study by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. \n \n The U.S. periodically has blood shortages, but the testimony at the two-day meeting focused primarily on the safety of the supply, not availability. \n \n Several countries, including Canada, have a similar ban as the U.S. \n \n The American Plasma Users Coalition, representing people who depend on the blood supply to maintain health, urged additional research, forecasting that revisions in the donation rules eventually will be made. \n \n But the coalition&#8217;s Mark Skinner also said, &#8220;It&#8217;s not about blood supply; it&#8217;s about blood safety ... Ultimately the end-user bears 100 percent of the risk.&#8217;&#8217; \n \n He said, &#8220;The fact that it&#8217;s discriminatory does not mean it&#8217;s wrong if it&#8217;s in the interest of public health.&#8217;&#8217; \n \n Added Corey Dubin, a hemophiliac infected with HIV from a tainted blood product: &#8220;This is daily question of survival.&#8217;&#8217; \n\n \n What I don't quite get is this: Even the groups that want to do away with the life-time ban for homosexual men want to leave in place a 1-year deferral where there can be no donations for 1 year after male-to-male contact. Why is that? Is there something inherently dangerous to the men's blood due to male-to-male contact? If it is just about HIV, then it would be a tacit admission that homosexuals are more likely to contract HIV than heterosexual men, or that homosexual men, in general, engage in risky behavior that makes it more likely they will come in contact with HIV.\n \n Even changing the stance to a 1-year deferral would make a de facto lifetime ban unless a homosexual is celibate for that 1 year.",

At least in the US. For various reasons. Is this news to you?\n \n Whether or not to allow blood donations is extremely complicated and is based on the prevalence of the transmissible disease among donors, characteristics of the infection itself and the predictive value of the test involved.",

As Jitobear points out: Diseases do not ask your sexual orientation, implying that the sexual orientation of the donors should not matter. If even those who are against a life-time ban argue in favor of different rules for homosexuals, it leads credence to the notion that sexual orientation does matter.\n \n \"inherently dangerous to the blood\" meaning that male-to-male contact itself pollutes the blood, making it undesirable for donation in some way.",
