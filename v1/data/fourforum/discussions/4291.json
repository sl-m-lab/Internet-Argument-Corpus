   "Yesterday I was sitting in class and the teacher was talking about whether or not the government of India had the right to force there people to be \" fixed\" if you know what I mean. Because of the expanding population India is running out of room and resources. Personally I believe that the government has the right and should use it even if it interferes with the rights of one individual. I would like to know other opinions on the matter",

   "I believe that the government should NOT have the right to \"fix\" people. Think about this, a group of people are pointing at you and saying, because of lack of resources and land, I am going to make it so you all never reproduce. What would happen to the population? It would drop, that is what they want right, but no one will be able to have kids, does that mean extinction? Although you may add that the government can create a lottery system, where so many people are chosen to get sniped. That brings up, once again, what right does ANY person have to be able to say 'you will never have kids, for the greater good of everyone else.'",

   "Knowing India, it would be a racist policy. Even as a democracy, they would have the majority out voting the minority. And, no one here would want to be in the minority.\n \n Such events as described are alledged to happen to the romany people (gypsies) in eastern european countries. Rounded up against their will and forced to have sterilization operations. Sux to be them (a minority) I guess.\n Such behavior was also evident in the early actions of the Nazis.\n All you need to do is point at a group and lable them parasites. Sucking off the wealth of others and contributing nothing but extra mouths to feed. Why, they're thieves. Subhumans. Why did Moses end up in the river? The slave population was too large. If we allow them to reproduce at this uncontrolled pace, the minorities will eventually be the majority. Do you really want such a thing to happen? Look at their wreckless behavior. They'll kill us ALL in their lemming mad rush to the ocean! *wipes spittle off of mouth*\n \n That's what's being said at the corner shops while the politicians sanitize the message and leave it simply at 'wreckless consumption of limited resources can't continue at this pace.'\n \n You're listening to the sanitary, inhumane, speeches and thinking 'Hey, this sounds good, let's do it.' But, the practical application is an entirely different ball game. Thus, I lable thee, Dutch, a closet racist and fascist. But, don't feel bad. You probably haven't thought out the ramifications of your policy. You're too tied up in the myth of 'limited resources' spoon fed to you by some nefarious group posing as enlightened individuals. Nature has a way of dealing with over population.\n \n Democracy isn't about the majority lording it over the minorities.\n Now, I dare you to find a completly homogenous population that would even think of instituting such a policy.\n \n While you may hear the message from India and think that it would be instituted across the board against all types. I can tell you some are chosen to be spared the process and that the undesirables and minorities are being looked at as the 'source of the problem'. They're the ones who'll go under the knife.\n \n And, with that, I ask you, 'Are you currently castraited yourself or in the process of becoming so?' \n I can tell you that I and my wife will not reproduce again. But, then again, we already have one together and I'm an adoptive parent of 3. If I personally want more children, I'll buy them.\n Personal choice.\n If the people don't want any form of rampant consumption of limited resources, they can stop their social welfare programs. If you're not capable of taking care of yourself, you can starve. If people want to make it so that you have to accept castration to recieve free assitance, then that's fine. It's still a choice the recipient gets to make.",
