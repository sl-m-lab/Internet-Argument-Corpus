(src)\n Even if you count suicides (assuming every single one of them was with a gun, which they weren't), alcohol still kills more people. So, if your intention is to save lives, then why don't you ban this stuff?\"\n\n \n Wow. I never thought you'd address that.\n \n \nYes. That answers your question of \"why don't you ban this stuff\".\n \n \n It doesn't matter that thousands die from it, as long as it's enjoyable, right?\n \n \nDo you do this on purpose, or are you really this simple?\n\n \n XXX usual, that is aggressive rather than point addressing.\n \n \nAnd once again, show me where I argued differently.\n\n \n I've been saying your supposed to argue differently!!\n \n \nOf course not, but it answers your question of \"why don't you ban this stuff?\"\n Because alcohol and tobacco are not designed to kill like guns are, and because you can't kill someone by pointing a beer or a cigarette at them.\n\n \n By focusing entirely on this question you ignored the rest of my argument!!\n \n \nOf course I didn't, because that was not what you asked. Once again, since you can't seem to remember what you actually asked:\n \"why don't you ban this stuff?\"\n\n \n Hahaha!! You're so oblivious that you can't even get the implications even though I explained them to you several times!! I guess you can't teach emotions to a sociopath.\n \n \nNo, you have clearly shown that you don't even understand what you wrote, as I addressed your OP, never mind what I wrote. You seem to think I was arguing against \"guns kill less people than alcohol and tobacco.\"\n\n \n Haha!! I've been telling you that you're supposed to argue against that!!\n \n \nAnd once again, I never have argued that point. If you think I did, it's easy to prove: quote the post where I did.\n\n \n I've been telling you that you're supposed to argue against that!!\n \n \nI answered the question you asked \"why don't you ban this stuff?\" Yet here you are, three pages later, saying I think I've shown that guns kill more people than alcohol and tobacco. Wow, you're just incredible.\n\n \n And by focusing on that question you either totally missed or totally ignored my main point!!\n \n \nSee above. Absolutely incredible.\n\n \n Like your stupidity? emoticon_smile \n \n \nMy inbox=my messages, to do with as I will. What, ashamed that you sent me a message?\n\n \n You should be even more ashamed, considering how bad you're getting your XXX kicked on here.\n \n \nYou're questioning my honesty? ### is that even supposed to mean?\n\n \n I'm calling you a liar! emoticon_smile \n \n \nOh trust me, those two points are very relevant, as shown by your latest post.\n On to #2 now (why bother...)\n\n \n How? I have told you multiple times that more people die no matter how many times easier it is to kill someone with a gun, yet you totally brushed that off, you never even addressed it!\n \n \nWow, you're right. You'd think they'd have some pretty strict laws in place to discourage that and to punish the infractions, wouldn't you?\n\n \n You wascally wabbit! Quit evading my point! Hahahaha!\n \n \nAnd once again, if I point a litcigarette at you from across the room, are you anxious/nervous that you could die? How about if I pointed a loaded gun at you, safety off?\n\n \n Well, if you want to look at it that way, then you are more likey to die from a lit cigarette!\n \n \nNice dodge.\n\n \n Who are you to talk?\n \n \nAnd now I am officially done. This much idiocy is too much for me.\n\n \n Yes. If was as embarrassed as you, I'd do the same thing. The only difference is, I wouldn't point out my own idiocy! emoticon_xbye",

That's why you don't see 5-year-olds buying chainsaws.\n \n \nYou're the ones who are babbling about \"saving lives\", we just want to defend ourselves!\n\n Have you seen the OP of this thread? Was it by a pro- or anti- gunner?\n Does this mean that it would be a fair criticism that 'the pro-gun side do not care about saving lives'?\n \n \nIn the UK, not the US.\n\n Either you can't read, or you can't remember. When I gave the sources, you said exactly the same thing as this, and I pointed out that all four surveys were done in America, by Americans, and were hosted on PubMed - a US site.\n You appear to be grasping at straws.\n \n \nFace it: you've omitted the quotes. Omitting quotes doesn't help you much, you know.\nWhich ones? Were they targeted at me?\n \n Feel free to re-post them, and I'll do my best. Like I said, all I did was respond to the OP and go from there.",
