   "The perfect Scam Job\n \n So what if a guy whose career isn't really going anywhere decideds one day to claim to be gay, then claim to be cured for the money. He sells tapes, CDs, videos, bookdeals, all explaining how he has been cured of something he never was in the first place, gay. We could count the number of men like this, not naming anyone in particular but this scenario could be playing right before our eyes. Think about the money to be made in public speaking, DVDs, radio spots, etc..... by claiming you were once gay then got cured by Jesus. You could make a killing on this. How can they really prove you were gay and then not. How could they prove you had tons of lovers that dies of Aids. It would be the perfect scam. I could really wake up tomorrow and suddenly be an ex-gay. Say I had tons of lovers, how could it be proven? Then I could start charging a large fee to speak on my transformation, even if I wasn't gay, I was never gay. I could get some woman to say she is my wiife, pay her with the profits and have some babies! WOW! I am rich, she is rich, everybody wins but those silly gays nobody likes anyway!\n \n Is this happing out there today? I have no clue, but I wonder.",
