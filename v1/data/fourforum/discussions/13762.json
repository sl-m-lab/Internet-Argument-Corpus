   "BBC News - Gunman on rampage at Missouri factory\n\n Terrible. 2 victims died and the gunman. I really wish we could find a way to stop such stupid jerks, before they go off! And I mean all over the world, to include gun controlled countries too!\n \n There was that Finish mall shooting and even more horrific news. \n \n Like this mayor in the Philippines.   Suspect in Philippine massacre pleads not guilty \n A member of a powerful political clan on Tuesday pleaded not guilty to murder charges in the Philippines' worst election massacre of 57 people, including journalists and members of a rival's family.\n \n Andal Ampatuan Jr., a town mayor in southern Maguindanao province where his family ruled unopposed for years, has been initially charged with 41 counts of murder in the Nov. 23 attack&#8230;\n \n Prosecutors said they have witnesses who will testify that Ampatuan led more than 100 government-armed militiamen and police in stopping the caravan at a security checkpoint outside Ampatuan township, then forcing the victims at gunpoint to a hilltop clearing where they were gunned down and buried in mass graves.\n\n \n And this.   GUNS HERE TO STAY \n Eastern Port of Spain has been labelled as &#8217;among the most dangerous places on the planet&#8217; by an international research body that tracks the growth of small arms and crime. \n \n In its report dated December 31, 2009, the Small Arms Survey of Switzerland explored the rise of criminal gangs and gangster-styled killings in Trinidad and Tobago and concluded the country&#8217;s gun problems were not going to go away. \n \n &#8230;. Stating in the paper&#8217;s executive summary that gun-related homicides have increased 1,000-fold in the last decade, Townsend goes on in the next chapter to recall at the start of the 21st century, T&T was pegged to be the jewel of the Caribbean, a haven of relative stability. \n\n \n Even in Gun Free England. \n   Four-year-old girl shot dead in Aldershot -- Mother critically wounded and man, believed to be child's father, found dead after reports of violent dispute  \n \n   Gang wars made estate a no-go zone for police --- Area was ridden with guns and crack dealing \n \n All horrific and senseless, but Penfold, why did you ONLY post what happened in America?",

If they are wrong they never conceed but keep repeating a lie much like they do on Kellerman and Bellesiles as well as others of that ilk.

   "I agree, Doc.\n Knowing that I have the truth on my side: \"Firearms provide effective self defense for those who are resonsible enough to use them, therefore are a reasonable means of providing it\", I am strengthened. Deep down inside, I know with absolute certainty, that my belief of \"the general citizenry is better served providing for their own self defense\", is justified.\n Knowing this with my heart, I have the ability to concede facts that I dislike and are counterproductive to my arguement. Since I know that firearms are an inanimate object and the user is the one that determines how they are used, I have no problem agreeing with points that are distateful to me. Yes, there are instances of abuse. Yes, there are those who exist that should not posess firearms. Yes, there are instances of people who should not have them getting them legally. \n I can concede these points because THEY ARE NOT PROOF THAT I AM WRONG, they are merely instances of things occurring that are distasteful and are the antithesis of my belief. Knowing the truth, I have the support of it. I can stop reiterating it, arguing for it, and blustering about it....and it remains the truth. It doesn't need me to remain the truth.\n \n However, take the anti-gun point of view. It is impossible to explain why guns are bad for human beings to posess for their own self defense......unless they have a metal disk called a \"badge\" whereupon it suddenly becomes good. It is impossible to explain why, since firearms are completely forbidden in Washington D.C., they have the highest firearms murder rate by population percentage in the entire country. It is impossible to explain why, if guns are bad, 99% of the mass shootings in the country happen where guns are forbidden to be posessed and not where everyone has one (gun shows, gun stores, gun ranges).\n When it is required to continue supporting the false belief that an object is inherently \"evil\" and that it suddenly becomes inherently \"good\" if you also posess a shiny metal disk, one is required to continuously pull XXXX out of one's @$$ to support it. An anti-gunner doesn't have the benefit of admitting they are wrong. They cannot afford to lose one single piece of the crumbling house they are building. One little breeze, and the house of cards comes tumbling down. This is why you hear so many crazy lines of logic. If fact A must be true, than it MUST be supported by fact B even though fact B is obviously wrong for the whole world to see. It is fear that keeps them going. FEAR of having to admit their misguided belief. Once thay have committed to walking down that road, it cannot be reversed. In order to reverse their direction, they must first admit their willing complicity in a lie.\n So, they are trodding an endless road with glazed over eyes. They can see the stupid reasoning and obvious lying that travelling on the anti-gun road requires, yet to reverse their course it would require something far greater: They'd have to supress their ego and shamefully admit not only their wrongness, but their previous complicity in supporting a lie.\n \n Much easier to continue supporting the lie NO MATTER WHAT LAND OF OBVIOUS IDIOCY AND MORONIC PROJECTION THE ROAD LEADS THEM TO. Deep down inside, they know it. After a period of time they have to commit. You can't willingly delude yourself while knowing you are doing so. So, since return from that path is impossible without admitting their willful deception, they take the willful deception just one step further in order to salve their own conscience: They force themselves to believe it. Much easier.\n \n This is why you cannot sway an anti-gunner. Not only would it require a humility that would astonish a normal person (imagine admitting to knowingly lying and spouting forth misguided information solely for the sake of your own ego without regard to the truth), it would also require one to admit brainwashing one's self in order to avoid that uncomfortable fact. No, if you believe the anti-gun hysteria, you have to have an ego that is forged in steel and the size of leviathan.\n \n Anything that reveals the man behind the curtain must be crushed at all costs. Note the anger that comes out whenever you stick to the real truth. ANYTHING that reveals the misguided road they are on MUST BE CRUSHED! AT ALL COSTS!\n \n \n They don't have the comfort that the truth affords us. The ability to concede one simple fact. Do so, and the walls of the lies they build, not to mention the walls of their own self deception, come crumbling down.\n \n You see, having deluded themselves into believing thier own propaganda, they make one critical mistake. They project. They believe that since they are on a road of lies and have brainwashed themselves, that we must have done the same except on another road. Since their road has led to a goofeyville they must defend at all costs, they believe that we must be on a similar road to our own goofeyville. Any little chink will be exploited in a grand hope that our walls will come crashing down. Oh the excitement they must have! This tidbit could be the straw that breaks the gun-nut's back! This will shatter their world first! Imagine the anger they feel when they heap tidbit after tidbit on our argument and it remains standing. They cannot see that the truth has no need for us to build it. They think we react for the same reasons they do. To protect our illusions. \n \n It's not illusions we are defending. This is why anti-gunners fear even the most tiny nugget and must refute it. They think we need to do the same.",

The general citizenry IS better served by providing for their own self defense with a firearm.\n \n Anyone disagreeing has had ample time to offer up obfuscating misdirection, ad hominum attacks, and outright lies. I guess my pre-emptive strike on these motivations has accomplished the objective sought: Only the use of the truth would provide an effective means of refuting my argument.\n \n And, as we can see, there is no truth in the anti-gun argument, or else it would have been offered up for perusal by now.\n \n \n Thank you. Your support is appreciated. Although I am gladdened by this victory, I am not a gloating winner. I recognize the validity and perspective of my forfeiting opponents. Even though I would have much rather gained success in my argument through the bold glory of heated discussion, I graciously accept this peaceful concession of the truth.\n \n Hopefully, since we all have peacefully agreed, we will no longer be adversaries and can now come together in unison.

May we all go forth in camraderie and with the support of each individual!\n \n You new firearms enthusiasts will find that those of us who responsibly defend ourselves are a welcoming group who form tight bonds and join together tightly in our opposition to victim mentality.\n \n Welcome to the club!",
