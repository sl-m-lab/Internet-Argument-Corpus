   "Saw this article and thought it was pretty interesting.\n Museum identifies new species of dinosaur\n \n I really love the part at the end, just because of how true it is:\n \nThat makes the newly found creature an intermediate between older forms with large horns and later small-horned relatives, said State of Utah paleontologist Jim Kirkland, who with Douglas Wolfe identified Zuniceratops in New Mexico in 1998. He predicted then that something like Ryan's find would turn up.\n \n \"Lo and behold, evolutionary theory actually works,\" he said.\n \n \n",
