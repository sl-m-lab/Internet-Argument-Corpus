   "A note to those who are not heretical Glenn Beck \"Christians\":\n \nIn Arizona, the harshest piece of anti-immigrant legislation in the country sits on the desk of the governor, awaiting her decision whether to sign it into law. \n \n Jim Wallis of Sojourners flew to Phoenix this week to protest this bill and was alarmed at what he learned - including ramifications on churches and Christians. The following quote is from Wallis' column:\n \n\"Arizona's Immigration Bill is a Social and Racial Sin\"\n by Jim Wallis 04-21-2010\n Arizona's new immigration bill must be named as a social and racial sin, and should be denounced by people of faith and conscience across the nation. This is not just about Arizona, but about all of us, and about what kind of country we want to be. It's time to stand up to this new strategy of \"deportation by attrition\". It is a policy of deliberate political cruelty, and it should be remembered that attrition is a term of war. Arizona is deciding whether to wage war on the body of Christ. We should say that if you come after one part of the body, you come after all of us.\n\n\n Christians for Comprehensive Immigration Reform\n \n And for those Heretics in Beck who are opposed to social justice...\n \n Many are praying for your souls.",

The mass immigration in after Poland joined the EU is not comparable to the US situation. The people coming in to the US is tremendously higher than those leaving and the untaxed wages do not flow back into the US economy. The UK also does not have the same violent criminal factor comparable to the US. \n \n The last several years has also seen negative immigration to the UK as a whole acting to stabilize the earlier flood.\n \n Curious, how do untaxed wages sent out of the country increase the economy of that country? You have to assume that if there were no immigrants to perform the job it would not be done. Thereby the benefit of food, housing and personal spending of the immigrant within the country would not happen. The problem is that more times than not the job would still be necessary, but would be done by a legal worker who would be taxed and pay the same housing, food and personal spending as the immigrant. They may need to be paid more, but that increases the standard of living of the population. Some businesses would not survive the increased costs, but others would open to meet the new demand generated by the higher incomes.

Here's what i mean: Bush To Use Waivers To Finish Border Fence - CBS News And here's an excerpt from the article:\n Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff had said using the waivers would be a last resort. The department has held more than 100 meetings with lawmakers, environmental groups and residents in an effort to work out obstacles and objections to fence construction. The department will conduct environmental assessments when necessary, one of the officials said. But the waivers allow the department to start building before completing the assessments.\n As for the Reagan Amnesty? Get educated for once in your life! Take a pop quiz to expose how absolutely ignorant you are. Take the Reagan Amnesty Pop Quiz!\n \n \n The fact is this is a failure on the part of government. THE WHOLE GOVERNMENT, not just the left. As long as you refuse to acknowledge the failure of both sides either right or left then there will be no solution.\n\n \n NOPE!!! The fact is it's the radical leftists who oppose the Right on every common sense policy they attempt to enforce, and then when they successfully block them, they turn right around and blame the conservatives as if we set out to not carry out the policy. \n \n Look at Nuclear power and Oil drilling in America, The \"Right\" attempts to accomplish them as power sources when they have the clout, the Leftists oppose them with the environmental arm of the radical left, then when they successfully block any progress by tying it up in court for decades, they turn right around when its politically convenient and blame the Republicans for failing to make their political promises happen.",

We would prefer that criminals stay in their country of origin, we have enough already. We like to not import sick people or animals that can turn an ecosystem upside down. We would like to raise our standard of living. Wage increases come from supply of available workforce. A constant influx of new labor expecting to earn less above demand drives down wages and increases unemployment. Which in turn impacts the effectiveness of social systems.\n \n The immigration laws are primarily to protect US interests, but they also serve to make sure that the immigrant has some protections. Women and children are not forced into slavery, people unaware of laws or afraid to go to authorities are examples. These things happen under the current system, can you imagine the chaos if the US adopted a come one come all policy?\n \n It's not about people of color. Do you have any idea how many countries whose citizens are granted asylum that are white vs. those of color? We have the same border policy North as South. There are just far less people who enter from the North who come here intending to stay is a more likely reason we don't have illegal entry issues with Canadians.\n",

It was far easier to blend into society and the opportunities were greater and resources more plentiful. \n \n It's an accident of birth where you are born and nobody is saying keep all immigrants out (well at least most) just respect the process because the intent is to give as many people the chance as the resources can sustain.

   "RUSSELL PEARCE is the quintessential Arizona Republican. He wears stars-and-stripes shirts and has clips of John Wayne and Ronald Reagan on his website. He loves guns, his family, his Mormon faith, his country and the law, which he enforced for many years as deputy sheriff of Maricopa County. He jokes that being Republican, and thus not having a heart, saved his life when he got shot in the chest once. But his main passion is illegal immigrants, whom he calls \"invaders\". He loathed them even before his son Sean, also a sheriff's deputy, got shot by one. But now it is personal.\n \n In Mr Pearce's opinion his law merely \"removes the handcuffs\" from the police and sheriffs' deputies so they can do their work. To a great many other people, however, it screams racial profiling. Arizona is an overwhelmingly white state, and virtually all illegal immigrants-perhaps about half a million in the state-are Hispanic. Whom else would cops suspect and arrest but the brown ones?

   "Honestly, I don't see that this is going to lead to racial profiling. That's definately the fear out there, and unfortunately, it's being perpetuated by sensationalist media, ignorant celebrities, and politicians courting minority voters.\n \n Believe it or not, most of the time cops can't see who is driving a car they're going to pull over...until it's pulled over and they're standing at the window. Seriously, next time you're driving, pick whatever car is in front of you, and see if you can describe the driver. You probably can't, especially at night.\n \n What this law actually does is say that cops, who are otherwise suspecting a person is here illegally, now have to pursue that. It doesn't mean they're going to be out hunting brown people. Trust me, in some of the neighborhoods around here, theat means they'd be pulling over 80% of the neighborhood's population. It isn't going to happen.\n \n It just means that when they do pull over a guy at 3AM who was speeding, and he doesn't speak english and doesn't have ID, is acting all nervous, they now will be able to check out his immigration status. In Tucson right now for example, if a cop stops a person and finds out they're illegal, the cops can't arrest. He can detain them only as long as is necessary to write them the citation he orginally pulled them over for. Then they're on their way. And this is with them freely admitting to being illegal, mind you. Sure, the cop could call ICE, but they're probably 30-60 minutes away.\n \n Shooter, your question about papers and dark days of history...you realize that every time a cop pulls somebody over, they have to provide 'papers,' right? License, registration, proof of insurance. I don't know about you, but that doesn't seem oppressive to me. And, coincidentally, that's the kind of ID that they'll be asking brown people for when they pull them over...the same stuff that they ask everybody else for anyway. If they're a legal nonresident, IIRC federal law already requires them to carry their papers with them anyway. It's kinda a nonissue.\n \n People, do everybody a favor. Read the actual law. Research what the legal terms mean. So much of this fervor is just due to misinformation and prejudice. Oh, a Republican came up with an anti-illegal immigration bill? Racist!!! AZ is a racist, redneck, backwater hick state!!!! OMG!!!!\n \n You guys that are arguing against this bill, you realize that many of you sound as prejudiced and ignorant as those you're trying to condemn? I mean, Winston, your post goes on about all these negative connotations about Pearce, and then you're trashing Republicans and the Tea Party in your sig? Do you really think you're being fair and open-minded about this?\n \n Just remember, not every conservative thinks or sounds like Easyrider, okay? Some of us are actually fair-minded, not racist, and not religious zealots. I know that isn't what you're going to see on TV, but believe it or not, it's true.",

   "RUSSELL PEARCE is the quintessential Arizona Republican. He wears stars-and-stripes shirts and has clips of John Wayne and Ronald Reagan on his website. He loves guns, his family, his Mormon faith, his country and the law, which he enforced for many years as deputy sheriff of Maricopa County. He jokes that being Republican, and thus not having a heart, saved his life when he got shot in the chest once. But his main passion is illegal immigrants, whom he calls \"invaders\". He loathed them even before his son Sean, also a sheriff's deputy, got shot by one. But now it is personal.\n \n In Mr Pearce's opinion his law merely \"removes the handcuffs\" from the police and sheriffs' deputies so they can do their work. To a great many other people, however, it screams racial profiling. Arizona is an overwhelmingly white state, and virtually all illegal immigrants-perhaps about half a million in the state-are Hispanic. Whom else would cops suspect and arrest but the brown ones? Even American Latinos who happen to be out without their driving licence might be at risk.\n \n Arizona's immigration law: Hysterical nativism | The Economist\n \n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n We in Australia are a truly multi-racial society.

   "Felipe Calder\u00f3n criticized Arizona's immigration law for being discriminatory. How tough are Mexican immigration laws? - By Christopher Beam - Slate Magazine\n \n \nMexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n criticized the new Arizona immigration law on Monday, saying that it \"opens the door to intolerance, hate, and discrimination.\" So how tough are Mexican immigration laws?\n \n They're pretty strict, but not often enforced. Until recently, entering Mexico without proper documentation was a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison, as codified in the country's General Law of Population. (Undocumented immigrants in the United States are held in detention centers until they're deported. They don't get a jail sentence unless they've committed other crimes.) In 2008, that penalty was reduced to a fine of up to 5,000 pesos, or about $400. If you're caught with fake documents, the Ministry of the Interior can fine you twice that. In most cases, undocumented immigrants are \"voluntarily repatriated,\" or asked to leave the country. If they're caught again, they're fined again and frequently deported. In practice, though, high levels of corruption mean that police will often take bribes from undocumented immigrants-and sometimes even rob them-instead of sending them home. (The punishments were reduced in 2008 partly because police were using the heavy penalty as leverage for extortion.)\n \n Mexican law determines who's allowed to immigrate \"according to their possibilities of contributing to national progress.\" That means scientists, athletes, artists, and other people with special abilities are given preference. So are investors who want to start a business in Mexico. The country makes it easy for Americans to retire there by waiving tariffs when they move their belongings. (The United States sends more immigrants to Mexico than any other country does.) It also incentivizes immigration from other Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries in Latin America and Europe by making those foreigners eligible for citizenship after three years instead of the usual five.\n \n There are other big differences between the immigration laws in Mexico and the United States. For example, being born in Mexico doesn't automatically make you a citizen. Also, naturalized Mexicans-those who gain citizenship some way other than by birth-don't have as many rights as people who are naturalized in the United States. In the United States, naturalized Americans can't run for president; in Mexico, they're also barred from many other high-level government posts. Nor can naturalized Mexicans hold dual citizenship. In general, though, Mexican laws against immigration aren't as strictly enforced as they are in the United States because fewer people are trying to go there.\n\n \n So shut up about Arizona's new immigration law. Other countries are far worse in how they deal with illegal immigrants.",

Tell me, does the bill not require police to have proof of wrongdoing when stopping someone and asking them for their papers?\n\n \n I will answer you since you appear to be the only conservative posting in this thread and everybody seems to be ignoring you.\n \n The bill does not require that the police have any proof of anything before they stop a person and demand that they provide their papers. The standard of evidence is \"reasonable suspicion\" which is the absolute lowest standard in the US legal system. \n \n This bill WILL without question result in US citizens beings stopped by police and required to provide identification and proof that they have the right to be in the country. If they fail to do so, they can be detained (arrested) until such proof can be provided. \n \n No matter whether they ever manage to grab an illegal alien with the new law or not, there is no question that there will at some point (and probably pretty regularly) be US citizens harassed and detained by law enforcement officers. \n \n This is unacceptable. Those here who pretend to be conservatives that are supporting this are showing their true colors. They are not conservatives. They are fascists. \n \n We already have laws that should resolve the immigration situation but the political will does not exist to enforce them. Where they have tried to use employment laws to cut off the jobs to illegals companies have banded together, pooled their money, and the political backlash has been severe. \n \n The simple fact of the matter is that it is not possible to implement this law without racial profiling. It simply cannot be done. Every state has a law that you must provide identification when a LE officer demands it, but every district court has found such laws to be unconstitutional so while in many states they are still on the books, they are not enforced. It is VERY rare that every district court agrees on ANYTHING. That pretty much puts this in the \"if you have any brains at all you know this is unconstitutional\" category.",

   "You don't like Arizona's law? Look at what Britain has done to deal with terrorist advocates.\n \n Britain to expel for &#39;hate&#39; speech - Washington Times\n \n \nLONDON -- Britain outlined tough new rules yesterday under which \"preachers of hate,\" who promote or glorify terrorism, will be thrown out of the country or banned from entering it.\n \n \"We have a number of names that we are considering at the moment,\" and the first deportations could come \"very quickly -- in the next few days,\" Home Secretary Charles Clarke said.\n \n Mr. Clarke itemized a list of \"unacceptable behavior\" to signal the start of a crackdown that Prime Minister Tony Blair alluded to earlier this month when he said, \"Let no one be in any doubt that the rules of the game are changing.\"\n \n The list announced by Mr. Clarke includes any act or speech that:\n \n \u0095 Foments, justifies or glorifies terrorist violence.\n \n \u0095 Seeks to provoke others to terrorist acts.\n \n \u0095 Foments other serious criminal actions or attempts to provoke others to commit serious crimes.\n \n \u0095 Fosters hatred that threatens to lead to ethnic violence.\n \n Unlike the United States, Britain has no First Amendment and some restrictions on free speech and a free press are enshrined in law. For example, reporters covering public trials are often limited on what they can write or say about court proceedings.\n \n The toughened ground rules announced yesterday target radical Islamic clerics, whom British authorities blame for inspiring the July 7 suicide attacks on London's transportation system in which 56 persons, including the four bombers, were killed. About 750 others were injured.\n \n Human rights advocates condemned the government's effort.\n \n Britain is facing a \"real and significant\" threat from terrorists, and the government and law-enforcement agencies must take countermeasures, Mr. Clarke said.\n \n \"That includes tackling those who seek to foster hatred or promote terrorism, sending a strong message that they are not welcome in the UK,\" he said.\n \n \"These powers are not intended to stifle free speech or legitimate debate about religions or other issues,\" Mr. Clarke said. \"Britain is rightly proud of its openness and diversity, and we must not allow those driven by extremism of any sort to destroy that tradition.\"\n \n Officials said the Blair government's rules are intended to clarify powers that the home secretary already possesses under Britain's 1971 Immigration Act.\n \n While Mr. Clarke's list formalized the rules, the tough new crackdown already had started, with the government's announcement earlier this month that it intended to deport 10 detained foreign nationals it suspected of posing a threat to national security.\n \n Among the 10 to be deported as soon as authorities can get the paperwork in order is Abu Qatada, a Muslim cleric convicted five years ago in absentia in Jordan and sentenced to 15 years in jail on charges of conspiring to attack American and Israeli tourists.\n \n Mr. Clarke's Home Office also has already banned Omar Bakri Mohammed from returning to his home in Britain after the Syrian-born cleric said he would not tell police about fellow Muslims who were planning terrorist attacks.\n \n He was last reported at his mother's home in Lebanon.\n \n The Islamic Human Rights Commission claimed that \"much of the reasoning behind the new grounds [for deportation and exclusion] is based on fallacy rather than fact. \n \n \"The idea that foreign preachers who don't speak English are radicalizing British youth who speak nothing but English is absurd,\" the commission said.\n \n The government's policy statement also drew fire from civil liberties groups.\n \n James Welch, legal director for the Liberty rights organization, warned that it failed to answer a key question:\n \n \"Will the government's deportation plans result in suspects being sent to countries with a known record of torture?\"\n \n The government says it already has negotiated a \"memorandum of understanding\" with Jordan, which has agreed that any deportee sent there would not be tortured.\n \n Negotiations on similar pacts already are under way with at least eight other countries.\n \n Manfred Nowak, the United Nations rapporteur on torture, said such agreements with countries with records of human rights abuses was \"not an appropriate tool to eradicate this risk.\"\n \n But Mr. Clarke reacted angrily to Mr. Nowak's comments, insisting that the United Nations should pay more attention to the rights of the victims of attacks rather than \"simply focusing all the time on the terrorist.\"\n \n No one has been arrested in the July 7 attack, but police in Britain and Italy swiftly arrested the four men they think tried but failed to detonate suicide bombs on July 21.\n \n Three of the suspects are still being held in London jail cells. The fourth, British citizen Hamdi Isaac, was arrested in Rome on July 29 and is in the process of being extradited.\n\n \n Now if Britain, what many consider to be a civilized nation, can expel and even ban people from entering, on the grounds of simply promoting a message that the government doesn't approve of, then why is it unreasonable for America to deport people who are actually committing a true crime?\n \n Or is Britain simply not a civilized nation, and rather they're barbaric and living in the dark ages where heresy will get you burned at the steak?",
