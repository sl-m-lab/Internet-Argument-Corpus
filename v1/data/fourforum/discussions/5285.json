Your analogy is a very big stretch.\n \n When a woman is pregnant she is, in effect, allowing the use of her organs and life processes. That is the donation of her bodily resources. Trying to say that aborting is a donation of resources is flawed.\n\n \n My analogy was largely based to the newly debated Act. When the child CHOOSES (ie. free will) to donate blood (ie. my view, abort), the parent is given a notification form. If the child doesn't abort, the notification form ISN'T EVEN GIVEN to the parents. The parents then have a consent form to sign, whether to support or cut down their child's CHOICE in donating blood. Whatever comes next is the parents' choice and it decides whether the child would donate (ie. they accept the child's CHOICE), or not (ie. they don't approve of the child's CHOICE). Parents deserve the right to at the very least know what their child is up to, after all, the government clearly states that the children are under parental jurisdictions and decisions until age 17.\n \n Anyways, the fetus IS a body part, a parasitic body part, yet one nonetheless. They are formed by the women (and a cell of a man), so it can't seriously be considered foreign, nor a donation. Is your toe foreign? After all, it has been grown out of a few cells of your body to form a large mass, would you stop to it? Losing a toe barely affects life, and it barely contributes to any body function. Would you stop \"donating\" to it?\n \n \n \nEr, ok. Should parents be able to force a girl to invest her body against her will and without her consent?\n\n \n If it means that they follow the state law, yes. I don't really care about abortion nor the stances, just that the law is being followed AND respected.\n \n \nThis is the reason you wish to outlaw abortions? Because you want someone to support you in your old age?\n\n \n If you don't have a child, who will support you at old age? Social Security? With baby boomers retiring soon, it's highly probable they'll go bankrupt before we get old. Our generation is screwed unless someone can reform Social Security (doesn't have to be Bush, just someone)\n \n \nYou think that forcing an underage girl through childbirth is a good thing because the child will have sentimental feelings towards the girl?\n\n \n If you don't think most children have sentimental feelings for their mothers, I have no idea what your values are.\n \n \nI believe in choices with consequences as well. However, I don't believe in using pregnancy as a punishment for irresponsible behavior.\n\n \n What punishment would you offer then? If there's no punishment, there's obviously no lesson learned.\n \n \nI don't know what you're talking about with \"taxpayer cover their backs\". If you don't want taxpayer money used for elective procedures, I can certainly understand that.\n\n \n Medicaid.\n \n \nThis varies from state to state. Some require both to sign.\n\n \n Haven't had it in Calif, then again, California is a Pro-Choice state.....they don't even enforce their acts regarding parental notification of their child's abortions\n \n \nNo, it's not. Some judges are pro-life, and all have it completely within their discretion to refuse a bypass. So we progress from parents forcing their child to \"invest\" her body against her will to a judge forcing a child to \"invest\" her body against her will? That is not much better.\n\n \n Note that I have never said \"forced\". Some may be pro-life, fine, there's always an appeal (not sure though). If not, I still believe pregnancy is punishment for underage sex, so in my views she must live with what she has. I don't care if it'll ruin her life (I can guarantee many in the U.S won't either), she made the ruinious choice in the first place, by having underage sex. Anyways, she can always put the baby up for adoption soon after giving birth, and there are many other options.\n \n \nNo, I don't expect the gov't to aid it. However, I do not believe the gov't should be able to prevent it either.\n\n \n Then we agree on something. And note the law isn't preventing abortion directly, it's protecting existing state laws that have been continuously violated and bypassed, which is a big NO to any governement.",

Your analogy would only apply if the girl needed parents permission to get pregnant, since pregnancy is comparable to the donation of bodily resources. You are advocating that parents be able to force her to remain pregnant, to donate her body and bodily resources to a \"parasitic body part\" (in your words) by not signing the form allowing her to have an abortion.\n \n \n\n Anyways, the fetus IS a body part, a parasitic body part, yet one nonetheless. They are formed by the women (and a cell of a man), so it can't seriously be considered foreign, nor a donation. Is your toe foreign? After all, it has been grown out of a few cells of your body to form a large mass, would you stop to it? Losing a toe barely affects life, and it barely contributes to any body function. Would you stop \"donating\" to it?\n\n \n If a cancer growth (formed from my own cells) began to enlarge my body, suck up nutrients and other bodily resources and made me very ill (and pregnancy is very stressful on the girls body) I should have every right to remove it with or without my parents permission. Is this donation? Not strictly but it is comparable. You, however, are advocating that parents can force a girl to keep this growth in her body against the girls will by not signing a form allowing her to have it removed.\n \n \n\n If it means that they follow the state law, yes. I don't really care about abortion nor the stances, just that the law is being followed AND respected.\n\n \n Well, obviously pro-choice people advocate changing the law.\n \n \n\n If you don't have a child, who will support you at old age? Social Security? With baby boomers retiring soon, it's highly probable they'll go bankrupt before we get old. Our generation is screwed unless someone can reform Social Security (doesn't have to be Bush, just someone)\n\n \n I will be fine without children to support me. This is a very idiotic reason to support forced childbirth.\n \n \n\n If you don't think most children have sentimental feelings for their mothers, I have no idea what your values are.\n\n \n I care nothing for your values. I am saying that forcing a girl through childbirth and then justifying it by saying well the newborn will have sentimental feelings so it's all ok is idiotic.\n \n \n\n What punishment would you offer then? If there's no punishment, there's obviously no lesson learned.\n\n \n I don't believe in using pregnancy and motherhood as a learning tool, a beating stick or a punishment.\n \n \n\n Medicaid.\n\n \n I'm aware that gov't programs cover abortion. They cover viagra too and sometimes plastic surgery. I can understand if you don't want your tax money used for elective procedures.\n \n \n\n Haven't had it in Calif, then again, California is a Pro-Choice state.....they don't even enforce their acts regarding parental notification of their child's abortions\n\n \n It varies from State to State. Some require both to sign.\n \n \n\n Note that I have never said \"forced\".\n\n \n Why would I care? That's what you advocate, regardless of the words you use.\n \n \n\n Some may be pro-life, fine, there's always an appeal (not sure though). If not, I still believe pregnancy is punishment for underage sex, so in my views she must live with what she has. I don't care if it'll ruin her life (I can guarantee many in the U.S won't either), she made the ruinious choice in the first place, by having underage sex.\n\n \n Well, at least you're an honest fascist, unlike most other pro-life people around. Truly told, you exemplify the pro-life position in it's entirety. You care nothing for the girl involved, all you care about is that she did wrong so she has to be punished.\n \n \n\n Anyways, she can always put the baby up for adoption soon after giving birth, and there are many other options.\n\n \n Yes, but that's after birth. I don't believe any woman or girl should be forced to remain pregnant.\n \n \n\n Then we agree on something. And note the law isn't preventing abortion directly, it's protecting existing state laws that have been continuously violated and bypassed, which is a big NO to any governement.\n\n \n What laws are those that this protects?",
