As Jo pointed out, it is not as if these people did not know the risks. Some of them have been there for many years. They knowingly placed themselves at risk to do something that they believed in. I admire their courage and dedication, however I marvel at their stupidity. It's like Steve Irwin...was anyone really surprised when a giant barb from a stingray pierced his heart? I wasn't. You can't beat the law of averages forever. \n \n Plain and simple, these people got away with it for so long and then they got stung. It's sad, and I feel sorry for them and their families, but it stands to reason that going into an active war zone to provide medical and dental care is a dangerous venture that sometimes costs people their lives. I am not saying that they deserved it, nobody deserves to be murdered (or raped for that matter, regardless of how they are dressed). It is simply a matter of risk. If you knowingly increase your level of risk, you knowingly accept the consequences that come along with it. \n \n I face risk as a paramedic in the ghetto on a regular basis. I knowingly do so, and I evaluate that risk each time I go out to determine if the risk is worth the mission. My partner and I train rookies and students, and one thing we tell them on their first night is this: \"complacency will get you killed, common sense will keep you alive\". In my opinion, these workers showed a little too much complacency and too little common sense.",

   "You're both right, and both wrong. \n \n It is not just a one sided thing. \n \n Were the killers wrong for killing them? Absolutely. Murder is murder no matter who did it or or what the motivations are. -more later on that-\n \n And, the aid workers were reckless in running around a war-torn countryside like Heidi handing out free medical care. Nobody deserves to be killed, but these people certainly and knowingly put themselves in a dangerous environment. \n \n Religion need not even be involved in this story. \n \n Look at this article, I found this an interesting slant on the story. \n \n FOXNews.com - Christian charity: Fighters not thieves killed 10 aid workers in Afghanistan\n \n \nFrans said the team was attacked as they made their return trip toward Kabul from their mission to dispense medical care to villagers in remote Nuristan province. They were set upon by gunmen as they got out of their vehicles to take a rest after crossing a swollen river just across the boundary in Badakhshan.\n \n The account squares with that given by the lone survivor - the team's Afghan driver Safiullah - whom Frans said has been released by Afghan authorities after questioning. An official who was familiar with Safiullah's testimony recounted it to The Associated Press. The official requested anonymity because he was not authorized to release details of an ongoing investigation.\n \n According to Safiullah - who goes by one name - an Afghan man in the area offered to help the team as it was trying to cross the river. Two members of the team - including leader Tom Little, an optometrist from Delmar, New York, who had worked in Afghanistan since the late 1970s - rolled up their pants legs and waded in to find a spot shallow enough for the vehicles to ford the river.\n \n After successfully crossing, the team stopped to take a break in a forested area at the side of the road, which ran through a narrow valley. They wanted to get ready for their long journey back though Badakhshan province and on to Kabul.\n \n The Afghan man who had offered to help the group left. Then came the attack. The gunmen rushed in, firing bullets over the medical team members' heads. Moments later 10 of the team were dead.\n \n It appears from accounts of survivors that the gunmen came from the Barg-e-Matal district of Nuristan which is closer to the Pakistani border. Insurgent infiltration has increased in that area since the U.S. abandoned small combat outposts that proved too difficult to defend and resupply.\n \n Safiullah told investigators he believes the lead gunman was Pakistani because he yelled \"Jadee! Jadee!\" - a word used in several regional languages that means \"hurry up.\" It is more commonly used in Pakistan and India than Afghanistan. He said all the attackers understood Dari and Pashto, the two main languages spoken in Afghanistan, but conversed in Pashaye, a local dialect used only in parts of the northeast corner of Afghanistan.\n \n Safiullah was taken hostage by the attackers and said they walked toward a flashing light that Safiullah said was meant to guide them to a village near Barg-e-Matal, scene of heavy fighting in recent weeks between government forces and militants who crossed over from Pakistan.\n \n The attackers later let Safiullah go and he fled on foot, eventually finding his way back to the town in Nuristan where the group had left their three four-wheel-drive vehicles and rented eight horses at the beginning of the trip.\n",
