   "Again, Michael Newdow makes an XXX of himself. \n \n http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&storyID=7371469\n \n WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chief Justice William Rehnquist rejected Wednesday an emergency request from a California atheist who sought to stop the recital of prayers at President Bush's inauguration. \n A federal judge and a U.S. appeals court earlier ruled against atheist Michael Newdow. He is best known for trying unsuccessfully to remove the phrase \"under God\" from the Pledge of Allegiance that millions of U.S. schoolchildren recite every day. \n \n Newdow, a doctor-lawyer who is acting as his own attorney in the case, argued that clergy-led prayers at the inauguration Thursday would violate his constitutional rights. \n \n \"As an atheist, he cannot in good conscience attend an exercise where his government forces him to endure religious dogma he finds highly disagreeable,\" Newdow wrote in his motion filed with the Supreme Court. \"Newdow's rights of religious freedom should be protected.\" \n \n Newdow, who lives in Sacramento, California, said he would drop his plans to attend the inauguration if forced to confront the prayers by two Christian ministers. \n \n 88888888888888888888888888888888888888\n \n Could Newdow be a white Jesse Jackson, stirring the pot to attract the media?",
