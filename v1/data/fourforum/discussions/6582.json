   "A very reasonable look at oil prices, and a brilliant idea for solving the temporary shortage problem - The Oil Bubble\n \n \nReviewing the history of oil-market boom and bust confirms that we are in the midst of a classic oil bubble and that prices will eventually fall, perhaps dramatically. Despite apocalyptic warnings, the world is not running out of oil and the pumps are not going to run dry in our lifetimes--or ever. What's more, the mechanism that will surely prevent any long-term catastrophic shortages in energy is precisely the free-market incentive to make profits that many politicians in Washington seem to regard as an evil pursuit and wish to short circuit.\n \n The best evidence for an oil bubble comes from the lessons of America's last six energy crises, dating back to the late 19th century, when there was a great scare about the industrial age grinding to a halt because of impending shortages of coal. (Today coal is superabundant, with about 500 years of supply.) Each one of these crises has run almost an identical course.\n \n (snip)\n \n The limits-to-growth crowd has predicted the end of oil since the days when this black gold was first discovered as an energy source in the mid-19th century. In the 1860s the U.S. Geological Survey forecast that there was \"little or no chance\" that oil would be found in Texas or California. In 1914 the Interior Department forecast that there was only a 10-year supply of oil left; in 1939 it calculated there was only a 13-year supply left, and in 1951 Interior warned that by the mid-1960s the oil wells would certainly run dry. In the 1970s, Jimmy Carter somberly told the nation that \"we could use up all of the proven reserves of oil in the entire world by the end of the next decade.\"\n \n (snip)\n \n If gasoline cost today what it cost a family in 1900 (relative to income), we would be paying not $3 but $10 a gallon at the pump. Or consider that in 1860 oil sold for $4 a barrel, or the equivalent of about $400 a barrel in today's wage-adjusted prices. The first of a continuous series of innovations, in this case the invention of modern drilling techniques in 1869, cut the price by more than 90%--to 35 cents a barrel.\n \n Fifty years ago people would have laughed out loud at the idea of drilling for oil at the bottom of the ocean or getting fuel from sand, both of which were technologically infeasible. The first deep-sea oil rig went on line in 1965 and drilled 500 feet down. Now these rigs drill two miles into the ground--and miraculously, the price of extracting oil from 10,000 feet deep in the sea bed today is approaching the cost of drilling 100 feet down from the richest fields in Texas or Saudi Arabia 40 years ago.\n \n This spectacular pace of technological progress explains why over time the amount of recoverable reserves of oil has increased, not fallen. Between 1980 and 2002 the amount of known global oil reserves increased by 300 billion barrels, according to a survey by British Petroleum. Rather than the oil fields running dry, just the opposite has been happening. In 1970 Saudi Arabia had 88 billion barrels of known oil. Thirty-five years later, nearly 100 billion barrels have been extracted and yet the latest forecast is that there are still 264 billion barrels left--although the Saudis have never allowed independent auditors to verify these numbers.\n \n (snip)\n \n Our point is that the constraints on our ability to find and extract new oil are not geologic or scientific. The real constraints on oil production are barriers created by government. Myron Ebell, an environmental analyst at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, notes that roughly 90% of the oil on the planet rests under government-owned land and these resources are abysmally managed.\n \n (snip)\n \n Here's one simple idea to increase the domestic supply of oil: Have Uncle Sam share its oil-drilling royalties with the California government. If Californians realized they could go a long way to solving their deficit and overtaxation problems by raising billions of these petro-dollars, the aversion on the left coast toward offshore drilling might well begin to subside.\n",

The dollar has simply lost a lot of its value, and oil is always purchsed in dollars.

   "Discoveries have not dropped dramatically, although the article did include the disclaimer that the Middle Eastern fields have not been audited for quite a few years.\n\n \n WRONG, and rediculously so. Last year, worldwide oil discovery was only 11.6 billion barrels. Considering the fact that we use 112 billion barrels per year (last years numbers), that is NOTHING. Oil discovery peaked in 1962 w/106 billion barrels. It has steadily declined ever since, and has fallen off drastically since 1990\n \n \n About reserves - \"proven reserves\" are those fields which we know about, and which we can tap economically at the given price.\n\n \n OPECs \"given price\" is $85 per barrel. Frankly if we get to the point that it becomes necessary to move that bar, our way of life will be extinct. The US will simply cease to exist if things ever become so dire that they have to move that $85 bar. \n \n \nThe tar sands of Alberta sat undisturbed for many years, but they've gotten pretty busy in the last few years.\n\n \n Yes, with massive subsidies. Oil from the tar sands costs (real cost) nearly $100 per barrel to produce. Additionally, it is energy intensive to produce, so the higher oil prices go, the higher the production costs of that oil go. If oil was actually at $100 per barrel, which is the break even point for the oil sands now, it would cost $128 per barrel to produce it due tot he fuel costs of the process. \n \n \n We do have more oil than the entire Middle East just in the states of Utah, Colorado and Wyoming, but it will cost about $65 a barrel to get it out with our present technology. \n \n \n Actually the proven amount there is less than half of what is in the middle east. Anything beyond that is speculation. You have the same problem with that oil that you have with the oil in the tar sands. It is energy intensive enoguh to pull it out and process it that it will never be profitable. The $65 number you are using is old. Now, it costs $84 to recover because energy costs have inscreased so much. When oil is $100 per barrel, it will cost mroe than$100 per barrel to produce.",

In the end, though, human ingenuity in pursuit of profit (there's that word again) can triumph -- if the government will allow and encourage it. I don't think a big reward is necessary, just keep the government from taxing it to death.\n\n \n \n Attracting necessary capital is not a problem. Our government is willing to subsidize just about any and all research that offers even a glimmer of hope. Despite the fact that solar has been proven to be unrealistic on a large scale (especially when you consider the toxic by-products), our government is still sinking money into solar in the vain hope that some incredible breakthrough will come and save us all. Hydrogen and ethanol are in the same boat. \n \n What the government does not pick up, there are plenty of private investors out there willing to pay for. I personally have spent tens of thousands of dollars researching alternative energy projects. Who would not want to be on the ground floor of whatever replaces oil? The problem is that once you get past the PR pages and into the technical aspects of these projects, they are doomed for failure, and nobody wants to be in on the ground floor of something doomed for failure.\n \n In order for an alternative to be viable, it has to be self supporting (cannot be dependant on longterm subsidies), it has to be at least as cheap as oil (there are plenty of expensive alternatives....cheap ones are harder to come by) it musty be scalable, transportable, and environmentally friendly enough to not kill us all. And the biggie, it must not be dependant on energy cheaper than itself for utilization/production.\n \n Oil is a high density, high energy item. Even the byproducts of refining are useful and valuable, and transport is as simple as pouring it in a jug. The environmental costs are not terrible, and it produces far, far more energy than what is required to pump it, transport it, and refine it. That is a pretty tough act to follow.\n \n The cries of \"scientific advance\" and \"human ingenuity\" are almost religous from you guys. Bad news, your god has let you down. Even if we use the DOEs old prediction of when our oil supply would peak, which was 2038, we would need to have some alternative in late stages of development in order to have infrastructure in place before seeing that peak. With their new adjusted date (2012), there is no possible chance of getting infrastucture in place in the allotted time. We are not even in as enviably posiiton as that. We have no alternative on teh table, so infrastructure is a moot point.",

In any case, we are in no danger of running out of oil for quite some time yet and when the price gets high enough, other alternatives will come on the market.\n \n Does anybody know what the French do with their nuclear waste?",

When the supply shrinks and the demand grows, the price will no longer be \"cheap\" and we will find ourselves in a whole lot of trouble... \n \n\n \n You have hit the nail right on the head here. The aregument over when oil will peak is (absurdly) between the geologists and the economists. Economists argue that as oil prices increase due to decreased suppy, the laws of supply and demand will act to mitigate demand. People will ocnserve more, blah blah. In the real world, the last oil crisis, which realistically only resulted in an 11% decrease in supply, led to a 280% increase in price. \n \n I had an economics professor who, when ecxplaining supply and demand, gave the following scenario:\n \n There are 3 men on a lifeboat. One man has food. The other 2 have money. The second man has $100. The trhird has $1000. Who ends up with the food? \n \n The answer was \"whichever man can kill the other two...there is no such thing as supply and demand on a lifeboat\"\n \n The oil situation is certainly a lifeboat situation. Our society, not just int he U, but in most of the western world, is simply so dependant on cheap oil that our lifestyle cannot exist without it. Besides its obvous use as a transportaiton fuel and lubricant, we also need it to make plastics, and fertilizer, and insecticides, and paint, and just about everything else. We even use it to process textiles.\n \n Anybody who thinks that the laws of supply and demand are going to lead to an orderly transition form cheap oil to some other mystery as yet defined energy source is a damn fool. \n \n Consider this....despite the fact that the US has the largest and best equipped military on the planet, and nearly every other nation on the planet is paring back their militaries to defensive levels, we increased military spending last year by nearly $400 billion and our redeployment strategy of late has removed the last of our militaries defensive posturing, but maximized its effectiveness for global deployment. \n \n Why do you think that is? Our military has proven to be a dismal failure when it comes to combatting terrorism. Nobody builds up their military like that, and postures it for deployment, unless they plan to use it.",

I like big business :p\n\n \n In general, oil companies have ROIs lower than many industries. The difference is oil and petrochemical product's ever increasing volume with big numbers. I'd much prefer an acceptable, stable ROI with those juicy consumption increases on almost a monthly basis. The really big bucks in oil are made by who own the oil in the hole and those who trade it as a commodity. Retail gasoline has probably been investigated for price gouging more than any other single industry and has proven to be a low margin, high volume product.",

   "I found this with google France's Radioactive Waste Management Program\nThanks for the link. It looks to me like they haven't really come up with a final solution yet:\n France reprocesses its own spent nuclear fuel. Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Japan also send, or have sent in the past, spent nuclear fuel to France for reprocessing. High-level reprocessed waste is vitrified (solidified) and stored at La Hague for several decades, where it awaits final geologic disposal.\n A research program to study high-level radioactive waste disposal began with legislation enacted in 1991. The French Waste Management Research Act of December 1991 authorized 15-year studies of three management options for high-level or long half-life radioactive waste. They included separation and/or transmutation, long-term storage, and geologic disposal. One site under consideration for deep geologic disposal in clay is currently being studied. The French are also searching for a granite site to research.\nI can't help but wonder if they will have their own version of Yucca Mountain protestors when they do decide on a final plan. I still think they ought to consider dropping it into a Pacific trench for a final solution.",
