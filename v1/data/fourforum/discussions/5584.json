   "Judge Orders Gay Flag To Fly From St. Augustine Bridge\n by Fidel Ortega 365Gay.com Miami Bureau\n \n http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/06/060805florida.htm\n \n \n \n(St. Augustine, Florida) The Rainbow flag was hung from St. Augustine's famed Bridge of Lions Wednesday morning ending a three-year battle between gay Pride organizers and the city.\n \n The final skirmish in the dispute came late Tuesday when a judge ordered the city to allow the St. Augustine Pride Committee to display the flag.\n \n The Committee and Equality Florida, the state's largest LGBT civil rights group, filed suit Monday accusing the city of discrimination. (story)\n \n In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Henry Lee Adams Jr. said that the Pride group's First Amendment rights had been violated when the city refused to allow the flag to be hung from the bridge, a focal point in St. Augustine.\n \n Adams ordered the city to fly the flag by 9 a.m. this morning and to keep the flag up for for six days.\n",

   "The article is unclear. All it says is that there is a list of criteria, and that the group in question met all of them.\n\n \n \n Actually there's another article which helps give us a bit more of a peek at what the specified criteria was that supposedly the group did not supposedly meet. \n \n http://www.mywb17.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=WJWB%2FMGArticle%2FJWB_BasicArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1031783063260&path=!frontpage\n \n End of the Rainbow\n By: Susan Cooper Eastman - sceastman@folioweekly.com\n Folioweekly\n Jun 2, 2005\n \n \nThe city says the St. Augustine Pride Committee's application didn't meet city guidelines that require a nonprofit organization's flags be related to a \"historical landmark or event in the city and [that] has historical significance associated with the city.\"\n\n \n The 365gay.com article gives examples of other associations which do not have any historical connection to the town or the bridge which have been allowed to fly their flags from the bridge. \n http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/06/060605flaFlag.htm\n \n \nFlagler College, a 35 year-old liberal arts school, was been permitted to fly flags on the bridge in excess of 50 days between 2004 and 2005, the suit says. Other permitted organizations include: St. Photios Greek Orthodox National Shrine, The Civil Rights Committee of St. Augustine, the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Museum and even the Broward Yacht Company, a private firm.\n\n \n Although the Jacksonville article does show how the gay group actually did meet the criteria. \n \n\"The city created that criteria in 2003, after the Pride Committee's first unsuccessful application. In response, the committee researched the history of gays in St. Augustine and discovered the first hate crime against gays in North America. Gay rights activist Ed Slavin says he discovered that in 1566, Pedro Menendez, the city's Spanish governor, ordered the execution of a gay Frenchman who was the lover of the chief of the Guale Indians on St. Catherine's Island, which was then part of Florida.\n A reference to the execution is found in Jonathan Katz's 1976 \"History of Gay America.\" Slavin also found a description of the murder in a book at the St. Augustine Historical Research Library. The incident is recounted by Menendez's brother-in-law Gonzalo Sol\u00eds de Mer\u00e1s in a 1567 account of the Spanish conquest. De Mer\u00e1s refers to the Frenchman as the \"Great Sodomite.\"\n",
