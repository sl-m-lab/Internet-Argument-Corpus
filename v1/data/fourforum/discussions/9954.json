John Lynch signed into law Thursday. \n \n \"We in New Hampshire have had a long and proud tradition taking the lead and opposing discrimination,\" Lynch said. \"Today that tradition continues.\"\n \n Couples entering civil unions will have the same rights, responsibilities and obligations as married couples. Same-sex unions from other states also would be recognized if they were legal in the state where they were performed.\n \n Several Northeastern states already offer civil unions.\n \n Massachusetts alone among the U.S. states allows gay marriage. Connecticut, Vermont, New Jersey, Maine, as well as California and Washington allow either civil unions or domestic partnerships, and Oregon will join the list with New Hampshire in January. Hawaii extends certain spousal rights to same-sex couples and cohabiting heterosexual pairs.\n",
