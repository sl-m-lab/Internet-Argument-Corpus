   "I see a lot of people these days upset about the impact homosexuality will have on their god-fearing, wonder-bread-eating aryan children. So I came up with the perfect solution!\n \n In public, one member of the homosexuality union could dress like a member of the opposite sex (whichever one feels more feminine gets to play the girl and whoever likes hot winds and footbool gets to be Mr. Man).... that way, your children won't have any idea that two people of the same sex are holding hands and in romantic love! All they might possibly think is that there are quite a few folks with hormornal balances roaming around.\n \n What do you think?\n \n But seriously- if one of the members recieved surgery, so as to become, physically, a \"female\" or \"male\", would this union be okay? Just what is woman or man, anyway? Does it have to be at the chromosome level (I don't think so- in ancient times there was no way to check chromosomes so how could Barnabas have possibly've known his new belle was a beau?)\n \n The whole issue would be hilarious, if the ignorance of others didn't destroy so many lives. :xbanghead",

   "So stop claiming Fox News is soo bad when there is nothing better...or worse.\n\n \n Now that is just HEEE-larious!\n \n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n An in-depth analysis of a series of polls conducted June through September found 48% incorrectly believed that evidence of links between Iraq and al Qaeda have been found, 22% that weapons of mass destruction have been found in Iraq, and 25% that world public opinion favored the US going to war with Iraq. Overall 60% had at least one of these three misperceptions.\n \n The frequency of Americans' misperceptions varies significantly depending on their source of news. The percentage of respondents who had one or more of the three misperceptions listed above is shown below.\n \n http://65.109.167.118/pipa/images/oct03/Table%201.gif\n \n http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/international_security_bt/102.php?nid=&id=&pnt=102&lb=brusc\n \n http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1067",

   "I see a lot of people these days upset about the impact homosexuality will have on their god-fearing, wonder-bread-eating aryan children. So I came up with the perfect solution!\n \n In public, one member of the homosexuality union could dress like a member of the opposite sex (whichever one feels more feminine gets to play the girl and whoever likes hot winds and footbool gets to be Mr. Man).... that way, your children won't have any idea that two people of the same sex are holding hands and in romantic love! All they might possibly think is that there are quite a few folks with hormornal balances roaming around.\n \n What do you think?\n \n But seriously- if one of the members recieved surgery, so as to become, physically, a \"female\" or \"male\", would this union be okay? Just what is woman or man, anyway? Does it have to be at the chromosome level (I don't think so- in ancient times there was no way to check chromosomes so how could Barnabas have possibly've known his new belle was a beau?)\n \n The whole issue would be hilarious, if the ignorance of others didn't destroy so many lives. :xbanghead\n\n \n \n I do hope you are jokeing? They are the ones who need change thier attitudes and give me and my family the same respect and acceptance they demand from me.",
