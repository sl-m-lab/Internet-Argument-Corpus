   "This is good news for Americans who respect the Flag and want to protect it from descration from Socialists and those on the left...\n \n http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-06-14-flag-desecration-vote_x.htm\n \n \n Vote on flag desecration may be 'cliffhanger'\n By Andrea Stone, USA TODAY\n WASHINGTON - The Senate may be within one or two votes of passing a constitutional amendment to ban desecration of the U.S. flag, clearing the way for ratification by the states, a key opponent of the measure said Tuesday.\n \n \"It's scary close,\" said Terri Schroeder of the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes the amendment. \"People think it's something that's never going to happen. ... The reality is we're very close to losing this battle.\"\n \n Congress regularly has debated the issue since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a Texas flag desecration law in 1989 and its own Flag Protection Act the next year. But until now, it has failed to muster the two-thirds vote needed in both the House of Representatives and the Senate before states try to ratify the measure.\n \n Next week, the House will vote on the amendment for a seventh time. If history is a guide, it will pass for a seventh time. That's when the spotlight switches to the Senate, where the amendment has always died.\n \n But this time may be different. Amendment supporters say last year's election expanding the Senate Republican majority to 55 has buoyed their hopes for passage. Five freshmen senators - Richard Burr of North Carolina, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Jim DeMint of South Carolina, John Thune of South Dakota and David Vitter of Louisiana - voted for the amendment as House members and plan to do so again.\n WHAT'S NEXT FOR THE PROPOSAL? \n The framers of the U.S. Constitution made it difficult to amend their work. The document has had only 27 amendments in 217 years.\n \n To become law, an amendment must win two-thirds majorities in both the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. Then three-fourths, or 38, of the 50 states must ratify it. If enough states don't act within seven years of passage by Congress, the amendment dies and the process must be started again.\n \n Shortest time from proposal to ratification: 100 days for the 26th Amendment in 1971. It guaranteed 18-year-olds the right to vote.\n \n Longest time from proposal to ratification: More than 202 years for the 27th Amendment, from 1789 to 1992. It says that if Congress votes itself a pay raise, it can't take effect until after the next House election.\n \n They will be joined by at least five Democrats who have co-sponsored the resolution, including Dianne Feinstein of California and Ben Nelson of Nebraska. Both are up for re-election next year.\n \n Not all senators have publicly declared their support or opposition.\n \n In 2000, when the Senate last took up the matter, 63 voted for the amendment, four short of a two-thirds majority.\n \n \"We're going to have deeper support for this, and the intensity is growing,\" Thune said Tuesday, which was Flag Day. \"There's momentum.\"\n \n Norm Ornstein, a political analyst at the business-oriented American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, says he expects \"a cliffhanger.\" He says Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., is eager to bring up the issue, and some Democrats may be too nervous to oppose it.\n \n Scenes of foreigners burning American flags may be common on TV, but such desecration is rare in this country. The Citizens Flag Alliance, an advocacy group that supports a constitutional amendment, reports a decline in flag desecration incidents, with only one this year.\n \n Still, \"it's important that we venerate the national symbol of our country,\" said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the amendment's chief sponsor. \"Burning, urinating, defecating on the flag - this is not speech. This is offensive conduct.\"\n \n The Senate Judiciary Committee may not hold a hearing until around the July Fourth holiday, and a floor vote hasn't been scheduled.\n \n University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato is skeptical about the amendment's prospects. \"They may come close,\" he says, \"but I would put good money on the likelihood that, once again, it won't be sent to the states.\"\n \n If it is, though, \"it is almost a foregone conclusion that the states would ratify\" the amendment, says John Vile, a constitutional law expert at Middle Tennessee State University and editor of Encyclopedia of Civil Liberties in America.\n \n Every state legislature has passed resolutions urging Congress to send them a constitutional amendment to ban flag desecration. Still, such resolutions aren't binding, and \"that doesn't necessarily mean it would pass in the states,\" says Heather Morton, of the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n \n A poll released last week by the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center in Nashville found 63% oppose a flag amendment, up from 53% last year.\n \n \"Clearly, more Americans are having second thoughts about using a constitutional amendment to\" instill respect for the flag, said Gene Policinski, the center's executive director. \"Many Americans consider it the ultimate test of a free society to permit the insult or even desecration of one of the great symbols of the nation.\"",

All it takes to destroy a government is to destroy the economy. Our economy is on shaky ground anyway. A series of targeted infrastructure strikes would impose MASSIVE damage with minimal outlay.\n \n Look at the New York city blackout. It cost 38 million dollar per HOUR and the last one was caused by a problem at a power station hundreds of miles away. Our antiquated electrical grid is ripe for destruction. It is essentially completely unsecured and has no security whatsoever outside the power plants.\n \n Drive down any american highway and eventually you will find a tranformer \"farm\". These are generally stepdown stations for regional distrobution. Their sole security is a 6 ft chain link fence with barbed wire around the top and a padlock. Great for keeping kids out, worthelss for protecting against a guerilla strike. The transformers are often filled with wonderfully flammable tranformer oil.\n \n The real beauty of the setup (if you are planning a strategic strike) is that you do not even have to destroy the entire tranformer. You generally just have to breech the outer case and the thing will melt down on its own. Additionally, if you take out a few, the ones that you missed will quickly go into overload (becuase the bus fuses are now on the distro lines, not the transformer feeds...I don't know what idiot came up with that plan) and fry on their own.\n \n So, 1 minute to cut the padalock, 2 minutes to set your charge, 1 minute to leave. 4 minutes into the operation and you are out of there. Your charge goes, and in a 4 minute operation, using $400 worth of explosives, you have taken out a $27 million dollar transformer farm that will take a week to repair. IF you want to get REALLY nasty, you hit two at the same time on opposite branches of the grid. Our grid is designed to be redundant, but will not take 2 major hits at a time. Knocking out 2 major substations on the same branch of the grid will cause a cascading failure, just like the one that caused the last NY city blackout.\n \n And you keep hitting them, and hitting them, and hitting them. there are over 5 million such transformer farms in the country. Do you know what it would cost to secure them all? It would be outrageously expensive. A single guard at each would not be sufficient, because all that would add to the operation is 30 seconds with a .308 to take out the guard. No big deal.\n \n Once they button down the electrical grid to the point it is nto worth hitting any more, you start on the water supply. Most water supplies are semi hardened in order to keep people from dumping anthrax or other nasties in there. This is great.

   "Isn't that a right enshrined in the US constitution? Isn't that the whole point of the RTKABA?\n\n \n This is a common misconception. Americans do not have the right to overthrow an oppressive government, they have a responsibility to do so. This is a theme that is pretty constant through most of our nations history. you are entirely correct, though, the primary purpose ro the RKBA was to ensure for the defense of the nation and to ensure that the citizens were never at teh mercy of a tyrannical government. \n \n \n \nAnd for the great uninformed, what is that answer?

As I peruse those papers about weaknesses in our electrical grid, communications (phones), water supply, food supply chain, etc.... I can't help but wonder WTF the president is thinking when he gets up and taunts terrorists. Apparently he has not bothered to read those fema reports, if he had, he would realise that 50 guys with $50,000 worth of commonly available explosives could put this nation on its knees and keep us there. \n \n John Boyd (great military thinker...died 1997) wrote the book on fourth generation warfare (his term). he predicted that international groups that would take on the US would first try to draw out our military, costing us a small fortune, and would essentially taunt the US until we started taking actions that isolated us from the rest of the world (morally and idealogicially). Once they managed this, they would commence infrastructure attacks against the US. \n \n \n I do not actively support the overthrow of the US government....yet.

In the UK most people won't notice if the government gets more tyranical, and we don't have a feasible way of preventing it, though general strikes have their uses.\n\n \n Most people int he US don't notice as long as they can base the actions on fear driven propaganda or make the changes in the courts as opposed to the legislature, and it is done slowly.\n \n That is just the way of sheeple. I think (and I could be wrong) that it was Mike Walters who said \"the american people will tolerate anything so long as it does not block traffic\".\n \n \n This is the problem. those who would seek the power that comes with political office are seldom the kind of men who should have it. Unchecked, they will snatch up every bit of power available to them, and then seek more by depriving people of rights and privilages they may have previously enjoyed.\n \n \"Power makes men wanton . . . it intoxicates the mind; and unless those with whom it is entrusted are carefully watched, such men will not govern the people according to the laws of the state.\"\n \n - Samual Adams\n \n \"The tyranny of a prince in an oligarchy is not so dangerous to the public welfare as the apathy of a citizen in a democracy\"\n \n -Charles de Montesquieu\n \n \"The Framers [of the Constitution] knew that free speech is the friend of change and revolution. But they also knew that it is always the deadliest enemy of tyranny.\"\n \n -Hugo Black\n \n I have noticed lately in the US that people seem to be paying marginally more attention to what is going on. A lot of this seems to be because political divisions along the left-right line are becoming more pronounced. The downside to this is that it pretty much means that Bin Laden is carrying out his plans and it is working, since political division within enemy nations was one fo the strategy points that AQ laid out. The up side is that it seems to have more people paying attention to political matters, and while a lot fo people are not necessarily switching sides on issues, they are becoming aware of issues for the first time in many cases (just look through the archives here....many people had no idea what kind of agendas we were pushing with our foreign policy).\n \n Will it be enough to get people motivated to action?

   "\n If you take it upon yourself to stand on your soapbox and burn the flag, this is what you are saying to me. You are saying that you hate this country. You are saying that the US is your enemy. You are saying that you have absolutely NO respect for the freedoms that others have died for. You are saying that you have taken for granted all the advantages of being American and you are a disgruntled citizen who simply hates. That's the message I get when I see folks burning the flag.\n \n\n \n While I'm not personally a flag burner, seems more efficient to contribute to political slush funds, I consider it any individual's right to do so as an expression of dissatisfaction with government policies and not indicative of hating the US as an entity. Call it an extreme protest against government policy. Worship of a flag is just as mythical and intangible as a belief system totem pole and neither have a place as defined requirements for citizenship in a democracy. Otherwise, start dragging out other manufactured idols, burning people at the stake, sacrificing virgins and whatever other forms of control are required to make a citizenry properly cowed by specific government controls. Or join the military as cannon fodder where that type of specific respect is an unissued order.",
