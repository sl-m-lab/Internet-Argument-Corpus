Anyone who signs the GC must abide by them in any armed conflict, even if the other side hasn't signed. Terrorists don't meet the qualifications to be considered prisoners of war, but the prohibition against torture doesn't apply to just POW's. It applies to all capture personel. Again, I'm not a lawyer, but that's the way it reads to me.\n \n http://www.genevaconventions.org/",

The media said it is ok for the US military to torture detainees, but, my brother said it is not allowed at all.\nThe GC isn't relevant where illegal combatants are concerned, and the terrorists are not covered. On the other hand, no civilized country practices torture as an official policy - breaking bones, removing eyes with a hot poker, pulling fingernails, amputations, etc. - and any country that does practice torture loses its moral credibility.\n \n On the other hand some softheads have recently proposed a redefining torture to include \"inhumane\" or \"degrading\" or \"humiliating\" treatment - all very vague terms that sound like a moral high road, but in practice are so undefined that mere confinement to a cell could conceivably qualify. In particular, there is a segment of society that seeks to equate torture with aggressive interrogation in an attempt to make sure our country is unable to defend itself from the next attacks.",

The thing that surprised me was that ALL of these devices were invented by the church for use on \"heretics\" during the religious wars following the Reformation.
