   "This thread is a mirror thread of the \"challenger's corner\" debate between myself and IANGB.\n \n The debate in the \"Challenger's corner\" is not open to all.\n \n So, if you feel you have something to add to the debate, please fell free to add it here. \n \n \nThe purpose of this thread is to continue/reboot the debate between myself and Chuz Life within the general topic of abortion legality. My contention is this: since joining the forums, Chuz has posted pro-life arguments based on the initial assumption of \"the fact that a human individuals life biologically begins at conception\". However, ever since he started a thread attempting to convince others of this 'fact', he has consistently ignored the vast majority of arguments against his reasoning - while continuing to tout the 'fact' in other threads. This has got to the state where I can't think of a single argument backing up his 'fact' that I have not seen (or, in many cases, written) a rebuttal to.\n \n My challenge to Chuz, then, is to provide an argument which backs up his statement. The statement is: \"Biologically speaking, a human individual's life begins at conception\". An alternative (shorter!) wording of the statement, taking into account the greater context of the Constitution, would be \"A zygote is a person\". As hinted by the title, the general context of this thread is how the statement relates to the rights of a zygote; we may end up branching out into that area, but the statement is the starting point.\n \n Feel free to repeat any prior arguments you've made, Chuz; I welcome this thread as the 'start anew' you suggested elsewhere. While I'll probably use the ideas I've rebutted with before, I'm quite aware I wasn't as accurate in my wording of some posts as I could have been; so no assumptions of my position on any specifics, please, just as I will (try to) make no assumptions of yours. In light of that - and given that it is you who is defending your position - I leave it to you to make your own arguments, rather than have me rebut a possibly misrepresented one.\n \n Fire away.\n \n NB: This is in the Challenger's Corner on request from Chuz, not me. As such, I cannot guarentee a swift reply - one is highly likely, but not guarenteed. Hopefully this won't make much of a difference.\n\n \n \n The purpose of this thread is to continue/reboot the debate between myself and Chuz Life within the general topic of abortion legality. \n\n \n Fair enough. \n \n However, before we start I would like to clarify a few minor points in your opening challenge.\n \n \n \n \n My contention is this: since joining the forums, Chuz has posted (1) pro-life arguments based on the (2) initial assumption of \"the fact that a human individuals life biologically begins at conception\". \n\n \n 1. I consider my arguments to be \"anti-elective abortion\" not \"pro-life.\" And I would appreciate it if you would try to understand the differences between the two. \"Pro-lifers\" approach the abortion debate from an \"all life is sacred\" generally religious based point of view. I do not. I neither believe that \"all life is sacred\" nor that \"god\" or religion should be used in the debate at all.\n \n 2. My argument that a \"human individual's life biologically begins at conception\" is not an \"assumption.\" It's is a conclusion reached by an indepth study of the facts and references available. \n \n \n \n \n However, ever since he (Chuz) started a thread attempting to convince others of this 'fact', he has consistently ignored the vast majority of arguments against his reasoning - while continuing to tout the 'fact' in other threads. \n\n \n I'm not sure what thread or posts you are talking about, IANGB. But If you are talking about posts where I invited you to start a challenger's corner debate,... here we are.\n \n \n \n This has got to the state where I can't think of a single argument backing up his (Chuz's) 'fact' that I have not seen (or, in many cases, written) a rebuttal to. \n\n \n That's great,... hopefully you will re-post some of them here and we can debate/ discuss them.\n \n \n \n My challenge to Chuz, then, is to provide an argument which backs up his statement. The statement is: \"Biologically speaking, a human individual's life begins at conception\". \n\n \n I accept.\n \n \n \n An alternative (shorter!) wording of the statement, taking into account the greater context of the Constitution, would be \"A (human) zygote is a person\". As hinted by the title, the general context of this thread is how the statement relates to the rights of a zygote; we may end up branching out into that area, but the statement is the starting point. \n\n \n Please note that I added the word \"human\" to your comment above IANGB. After all it is not my claim that all zygotes are human beings / \"persons.\" Agree? Also, I want to make it clear that I am arguing only for the most basic of human rights (life) and not for the full panopoly of rights that say an adult human individual would have.\n \n \n \n Feel free to repeat any prior arguments you've made, Chuz; I welcome this thread as the 'start anew' you suggested elsewhere.

   "MIRRORED POST\n \n \nP.S. If it's ok with you, IANGB,... I would like to keep this debate ONLY between the two of us; and (if it's ok with Admin) I would like to create a mirror thread in the Abortion forum for those who want to add their 2 cents.\nThat sounds good to me. Although it might be easiest to preserve flow later on it we don't actually mirror each of our posts once comments arrive (and inevitably digress) - just let people quote/cite us from this one if needs be. I certainly plan on adding in more off-topic commentary/digressions in the mirror thread (marked in these posts as *, when I remember to).\n \n Incidentally, I hate to be finicky with names, but there's not need to go all-caps with my name - I keep imagining you shouting it! Iangb, iangb or just plain Ian is all good.\n \n \nIANGB, I consider my arguments to be \"anti-elective abortion\" not \"pro-life.\" And I would appreciate it if you would try to understand the differences between the two. \"Pro-lifers\" approach the abortion debate from an \"all life is sacred\" generally religious based point of view. I do not. I neither believe that \"all life is sacred\" nor that \"god\" or religion should be used in the debate at all.\nFair enough; I was just simplifying and using 'pro-life' as a dichotomy with 'pro-choice'. Clearly, it's not that simple.\n \n With regards to religion in the debate - that's fine by me for this thread*.\n \n \nMy argument that a \"human individual's life biologically begins at conception\" is not an \"assumption.\" It is a conclusion reached by an in depth study of the facts and references available. Please don't malign my position this way again as I will not attempt to malign yours.\nApologies, that wasn't my intention. My meaning was this; while it was your conclusion, your use of it as an unsupported 'fact' forced us to treat it as an assumption. We had no way by which we could make it a conclusion - that's the purpose of this thread!\n \n \nThat's great,... hopefully you will re-post some of [your rebuttals] here and we can debate/ discuss them.\nI will; but I'd like you to make your arguments before I post the rebuttal! This ensures that I haven't just misread/misremembered your position from earlier - it also saves me wasting time rebutting something which you can instantly dismiss as a misunderstanding of your POV.\n \n I will post an argument supporting my POV for you to rebut, however - either at the end of this post or (more likely) tomorrow, depending on when sleep happens.\n \n \nPlease note that I added the word \"human\" to your comment above IANGB. After all it is not my claim that all zygotes are human beings / \"persons.\" Agree? Also, I want to make it clear that I am arguing only for the most basic of human rights (life) and not for the full panopoly of rights that say an adult human individual would have.\n\"Human\" is all good, as is your definition of the right you are arguing for - although I may use that definition as a talking point! I have no objections here.\n \n \nI hope that we will have had the most informative. intellectually honest and civil discussion possible. And that it serves as an example and benefit to others.\n \n Let's get it on! \n\n Ditto! With that in mind...\n \n I want to let you make your own arguments for your position before I post a rebuttal to any of them, for reasons described above. Instead, though, I can post a brief few arguments of my own.\n \n Firstly: the statement you are trying to support is \"Biologically speaking, a human individual's life begins at conception\". However, the word 'life' - that which you are arguing has a factually determinable beginning, does not have an absolute biological definition. To quote the wikipedia article on it: \"It is still a challenge for scientists and philosophers to define life in unequivocal terms\". This is doubly the case when considering the 'life' of an individual, as opposed to the 'life' of, say, a skin cell. For example, a person with no brain activity can be composed of living cells if they are kept on life support, but legally and medically the individual is considered dead.\n \n The argument, then: If 'life' has no definitive definition, how can you argue that it has a clearly definable start?\n \n Secondly: Consider a zygote. According to you, it is an individual. But a zygote can split into two - to form monozygotic, or 'identical', twins. Before splitting, it is one 'individual'. Afterwards, it is two. Where has the extra individual come from? Given that the split can happen up to 15 days after fertilisation, when was the start of that individuals life?\n \n Thirdly: In contrast to identical twins, consider a chimera organism. A chimera is made up of cells containing one of two different strands of human DNA - they are formed when two fertilised eggs or early embryos collide and become one embryo, which then goes on to be a single human being. Given that the single individual was created by the merging of two different individuals (by your definition), when was the biological start of their life?",

   "Chuz Life are you a religious person?\n \n I am just wondering why you think humans are so special as to deserve your fanatic defense.\n\n \n You know, Accipter... In all seriousness, every now and then someone asks me a question or makes me aware of something in some other way (a painting, story, song, poem, etc.) that either gives me a chill or makes me just pause and think a little differently. Your question (though I've been asked it before) just gave me pause.\n \n I know that many of my own family members don't understand my passion and perseverance on the abortion issue. I have tried several times to explain it. To fire up their passions. To understand it myself,... etc.\n \n It's a very complicated thing.\n \n The short answer to your question is that I don't fight abortion because I think humans are special. I generally don't like people at all. (Just being honest) I have friends. I have loved ones. There are those I admire and respect as well as those I despise. But I would rather be alone as to be in a store, gathering place or even at a party most of the time. \n \n I had to go to a psychiatrist/ marriage counselor prior to divorcing my first wife. It was required by the State. We each had to talk to the counselor alone as well as together. At the end, the counselor told us his thoughts. \n \n He said that \"becuase my mother died when I was a baby (most of this is in my profile by the way),... I have lived my whole life trying to make her proud of me,... only she could never tell me that she was.\" \n \n I disregarded the Dr. at the time becuase I was so caught up in my divorce. But later, it really made sense to me. I probably did subconciously do things that I thought would make her proud. And after that realization, and ever since that realization I now do it conciously. \n \n Why abortion? (you might ask)\n \n I tried also to explain it in my profile. HERE.\n \n At any rate. It is what it is. I'm too old to die young and I'm not changing now because It must be what I want to do,... and as frustrated as I can sometimes get,.... I would still rather be doing this more often than not.",

   "Chuz is currently writing a summary of his argument so far. I thought I'd make a summary of my own argument so far before viewing his, so that when I do I can see how much (if any) my response will change. This, then, is my summary of the thread so far. Format: To start with, I'm going to post Chuz's position and my own. Then I'll post my own arguments and Chuz's responses, then my responses to his responses and so on. I'll use a (hopefully intuitive) number-system that I'm making up as I go along to show which argument is which, so you can follow threads of an argument from start to end. Note that these are meant to summarise the arguments only, not the contents of each separate post, so I've skipped some of the more minor hiccups to keep it as short as possible. Note also: I've summarised all of this at the bottom of the post (for all those tl;dr-ers)\n \n Chuz's position: \"Biologically speaking, a human individual's life begins at conception\"\n Ian's position: \"Chuz's position is not provably true\"\n \n Ian's opening arguments:\n 1 A zygote can split up to 15 days after conception, resulting in identical twins. The idea that a zygote is a human individual ('a person') is directly contradicted by this fact: If a singlular zygote is a singluar person, where does the second twin come from, and when does it's life start?\n Chuz has not responded to this argument.\n 2 Two zygotes can merge to form a 'chimera' - a single person whose body is made up of cells containting one of the two DNA strands from the two zygotes. This fact directly contradicts the idea that a 'human individuals life starts at conception', unless Chuz wants to argue that it's possible for one individual to have two biological starts to their life.\n Chuz has not responded to this argument.\n 3 When proving that X=Y, the only way to do so is to define 'Y' and then show that X matches the definition (or vice versa). At the very least, Y must be defined 'implicitely': for example, I could say \"This must be an online debate, I'm typing it into a computer\", which would define an online debate as 'something which can be typed into a computer'. The definition of 'life' is not unequivocal, especially the life of an 'individual' as opposed to the life of something like a 'cell'. My contention is that Chuz cannot define 'life', so he cannot prove that a zygote is alive.\n \n Chuz responded with a statement of two parts:\n 3.1 You don't need to define 'Y' to prove that 'X=Y'. For example, when you define an adult as 'alive', do you question your definition every time you do so?\n 3.2 A zygote is provably alive based on these facts: the Wikipedia article on defining 'life', the planned parenthood article defining 'zygote', the biologyreference defining 'life cycle', the \"fact that animals (including humans) pass on life from one generation to another and must do so without breaking the life cycle\". There is overwhelming evidence that a zygote is alive.\n \n Ian responds again:\n 3.1.1 Yes, you do - there isn't any other way. The question 'is an adult alive' has been answered pretty exhaustively so is not often brought into question. However, there are some cases (generally euthanasia-related) where the argument is still being raised.\n Chuz has not responded to this argument\n 3.1.2 You have implicitely given several definitions for 'life' - for example, that something is alive if it is part of a life cycle.\n Chuz has not responded to this argument.\n 3.2 The definitions you have implied so far (see 3.1.2.) do, indeed, define a zygote as 'alive'. However, there is a difference between the life of an 'individual' (a person) and the life of 'a cell', as implied by my original post. I deny that a zygote is alive as an individual, not as a cell.\n \n Back to Chuz:\n 3.2.1 It doesn't matter which definition of 'life' you use, it isn't made specific in the constitution.\n 3.2.2 What makes a single-celled amoeba an individual organism, but a zygote is not considered as one?\n 4 I've shown that a zygote is alive (see 3.2), that it is a human (what else is it?) and that it is 'A' individual (it is 'an individual zygote'). That's the lot!\n \n And...

If you clarify this for me, I can better answer your question: Does it matter which definition of 'life' we use? \n 4: What evidence do you have that a zygote is an organism? How does this help you prove that a zygote is an alive human individual?\n \n I need to write a response to Chuz's use of various definitions: 'life' in the cellular form, possibly his use of 'person' (depending on what clarification he provides for question #3), his use of 'individual' without any context (to clarify my argument #4.6). I shall do so when we return to the argument proper.\n \n ...Like I said, Chuz, please feel free to comment on anything in here.

   "Chuz is currently writing a summary of his argument so far. I thought I'd make a summary of my own argument so far before viewing his, so that when I do I can see how much (if any) my response will change. This, then, is my summary of the thread so far. Format: To start with, I'm going to post Chuz's position and my own. Then I'll post my own arguments and Chuz's responses, then my responses to his responses and so on. I'll use a (hopefully intuitive) number-system that I'm making up as I go along to show which argument is which, so you can follow threads of an argument from start to end. Note that these are meant to summarise the arguments only, not the contents of each separate post, so I've skipped some of the more minor hiccups to keep it as short as possible. Note also: I've summarised all of this at the bottom of the post (for all those tl;dr-ers)\n \n Chuz's position: \"Biologically speaking, a human individual's life begins at conception\"\n Ian's position: \"Chuz's position is not provably true\"\n \n Ian's opening arguments:\n 1 A zygote can split up to 15 days after conception, resulting in identical twins. The idea that a zygote is a human individual ('a person') is directly contradicted by this fact: If a singlular zygote is a singluar person, where does the second twin come from, and when does it's life start?\n Chuz has not responded to this argument.\n 2 Two zygotes can merge to form a 'chimera' - a single person whose body is made up of cells containting one of the two DNA strands from the two zygotes. This fact directly contradicts the idea that a 'human individuals life starts at conception', unless Chuz wants to argue that it's possible for one individual to have two biological starts to their life.\n Chuz has not responded to this argument.\n 3 When proving that X=Y, the only way to do so is to define 'Y' and then show that X matches the definition (or vice versa). At the very least, Y must be defined 'implicitely': for example, I could say \"This must be an online debate, I'm typing it into a computer\", which would define an online debate as 'something which can be typed into a computer'. The definition of 'life' is not unequivocal, especially the life of an 'individual' as opposed to the life of something like a 'cell'. My contention is that Chuz cannot define 'life', so he cannot prove that a zygote is alive.\n \n Chuz responded with a statement of two parts:\n 3.1 You don't need to define 'Y' to prove that 'X=Y'. For example, when you define an adult as 'alive', do you question your definition every time you do so?\n 3.2 A zygote is provably alive based on these facts: the Wikipedia article on defining 'life', the planned parenthood article defining 'zygote', the biologyreference defining 'life cycle', the \"fact that animals (including humans) pass on life from one generation to another and must do so without breaking the life cycle\". There is overwhelming evidence that a zygote is alive.\n \n Ian responds again:\n 3.1.1 Yes, you do - there isn't any other way. The question 'is an adult alive' has been answered pretty exhaustively so is not often brought into question. However, there are some cases (generally euthanasia-related) where the argument is still being raised.\n Chuz has not responded to this argument\n 3.1.2 You have implicitely given several definitions for 'life' - for example, that something is alive if it is part of a life cycle.\n Chuz has not responded to this argument.\n 3.2 The definitions you have implied so far (see 3.1.2.) do, indeed, define a zygote as 'alive'. However, there is a difference between the life of an 'individual' (a person) and the life of 'a cell', as implied by my original post. I deny that a zygote is alive as an individual, not as a cell.\n \n Back to Chuz:\n 3.2.1 It doesn't matter which definition of 'life' you use, it isn't made specific in the constitution.\n 3.2.2 What makes a single-celled amoeba an individual organism, but a zygote is not considered as one?\n 4 I've shown that a zygote is alive (see 3.2), that it is a human (what else is it?) and that it is 'A' individual (it is 'an individual zygote'). That's the lot!\n \n And... Ian:\n 3.2.1 I'd like to respond to this, but first can you clarify part of your position for me: Assuming you managed to prove your opening position, on what basis does that show that a zygote is a 'person' as stated in the constitution?\n Chuz has not responded to this request for clarification, so Ian has not responded to Chuz's 3.2 argument, above.\n 3.2.2 An amoeba has several required characteristics which a zygote does not: it is independent, it can reproduce, part of it dies when it is cut in half (rather than forming two seperate cells)\n Chuz has not responded to this argument, beyond a refuted complaint that I was not 'comparing' a zygote and an amoeba.\n 4 By the definitions you have given, a sperm/egg cell is also an 'alive human individual', as is a skin cell. What makes a zygote different from these examples?\n \n Chuz:\n 4 A zygote is an organism. None of the others are.

This does, however, highlight my earlier arguments, 1 and 2, because they are the only non-semantic arguments here.\n Chuz has not responded to this argument.\n 4.6 How does 'organism' relate to the question 'is a zygote an alive human individual'? This is a case of special pleading: the actual conclusion you should be drawing is that your original definition (of an 'alive human individual') is wrong somewhere.\n Chuz has not responded to this argument.\n \n Chuz:\n 4.1.1 Let's see what a Planned Parenthood expert has to say on the matter...\n 4.1.2 Here is a scientific abstract which implies that a zygote is an organism\n 4.2 The dictionary definition for 'zygote' includes the word 'organism'\n 4.4 Dana says that a zygote \"might match the definition for an organism\"\n \n Dr Wolpe (PP expert):\n 4.1.1 I disagree with the PP definition.\n *unknown extras*\n \n Ian:\n 4.1.1 That's now two experts who share the same view that a zygote is not an organism, then\n 4.1.2 The article is about mouse embryos, not human zygotes.

   "HUH?\n \n Is there a time limit or something, Steeeve? What's the hurry?\n \n I have a life outside these forums and many other responsibilities as well.\n \n I want to present a good argument and summary. Please give me the time to do so. \n \n You say that you are pro-life or anti-abortion as well,... Perhaps you could post your own arguments and a summary for comparison. I think that could be very helpfull. Why wouldn't it? \n \n Of course, it wouldn't help to post it in on top of our thread. But you could always start a new one. I really would like to read it and I may even adopt some of it as my own. \n Calm down...I said it just seemed like it. Why did my post get deleted from the other thread by the way?\n \n \nDidn't you click on the links to Dr. Wolpe's biographical information, Steeeve?\n \n Certainly, Dr. Wolpe has less authority (now) with me than he did when I first introduced him to our debate. But that's only because he (in my view) undermined his own conclusions and ran from our exchange.\n \n Dr. Wolpe. has only the authority that someone is willing to give him. (Same as any so called person of 'authority') Do his opinions make a difference? I guess that depends on who is taking him into consideration . Does anyone's opinions make a difference? I'm sure Dr. Wople's employers (Emory university and Pennsylvania University) valued his opinions.\nSo really his opinion makes no difference...it is just merely another opinion. Nothing wrong with that just clearing it up :)\n \n \nSure it does. Right now we are focused on the biological aspects. If and when Iangb and myself can ever agree on the biological beginnings of a human individual's life, I will certainly invite him to a debate on the Constitutionality aspects. (see why we can't hurry these things?)\nWell this is a different debate I think which is why I asked.\n \n \nAt this point, nothing is being argued. I am providing my arguments as Iangb has challenged me to do and we will decide what needs to be debated after that.\n \n I can't wait to see your own arguments for when a new person's life (and rights) begins, Steeeve. If you can do it soon, I might even borrow some of it.\n \n emoticon_xagree\nMy view is simple and basically takes the \"who are you to decide\" kind of approach. \n \n I think we can all agree that if a zygote is left alone that in a normal course of events a fetus will form then baby then toddler then annoying teenager then adult..etc. A sperm and egg left alone will not do anything nor will a tree ever become a fetus etc. I also think about all the times in history when we try to define what is or isn't a human. I can't think of one time where that has gone over well. So my point to all of this is that I think it is unwise to decide at one point we value because 1) you have no authority to do so 2) to do so has proven fatal in the past. You basically start growing at some point and die at some point and we should value that all. So, that is really the short version of one of my arguments....doesn't get into why we value in the first place or some other details but hopefully you get the point.\n \n I will say I do not see the \"intelligence\" argument as valid. It is 100% subjective, can be applied to other animals, and makes we wonder why value doesn't increase with more intelligence or decrease with less. I value humans regardless of development for what they are...not how they think.",

That hardly proves that they also must \"value\" gay marriage.\n \n Basic Human rights have long been established.\n \n For a long time, slaves were denied their rights and humanity specifically because they were valued MORE as property than they were recognized as \"persons.\" Those reluctant (sound familiar?) were eventually dragged to the acceptance of blacks as having rights. \n \n Do you think they automatically \"valued\" them as human beings? \n \n Of course not.\n \n That's why the \"values\" angle is a non-sequitur.\n \n Work happens.",

Don't they?\nI argue that value comes from something higher than what is being valued. So for example, I can't decide your value is less than mine, have that be universally true, and therefore make you my slave. We have a history in this country of thinking we can place values on ourselves and we try to arbitrarily create a definition based upon your own criteria you are giving to yourself. It actually creates a circular argument because you assume you have authority to give yourself value but you'd have to have value to do so and it makes a big circle. \n \n \nSo, if a child is alive,.... no matter what stage of life, growth or development they are in,... they have a right to the life they are living.\n \n Don't they?\nThey have the same rights your or I do.

For a non believer abortion being ok is never a wrong answer so a non-believer can only be convinced if he or she has randomly decided to think all humans have value and the unborn is a human.
