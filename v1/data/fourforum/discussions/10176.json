   "Ok, I'll kick off (unless someone beats me to it). I have read the Bible in its entirety. I have studied it several times in its entirety. I have discoursed at length over many years with thousands of people on the subject. As part of a theology degree, I wrote countless essays on aspects of the Bible. And yet there is so much of it I don't know.\n \n One thing IS clear, though, and that is that any amount of individuals and groups can interpret it any way they want, that the Bible itself facilitates that, and its infallibility can be called into question because it is NOT harmonious.\n \n If one belongs to a religious group, any doubts expressed to a minister are easily resolved. The more these are resolved, the more the Bible is taken at face value, and therefore assumed to be correct. It's the other silly cults that have it wrong...\n \n Any yet the Bible is in its own right a tremendous reference work chronicling the history and beliefs of a people. Clearly it has had much impact on civilisation. But, if God really is the Author, then it ought to stand aloof and untarnished against the most severe criticism and enquiry. And this it can't do.\n \n As a literary work, I have great respect for the Bible: as to the unquestionable penmanship of God... no.",

Is it the testimony of various men (and women?) communicating and perhaps editing what God said to them?\n \n James.\n\n That's what Christians are supposed to believe. The Bible itself says (and that's the circular argument, of course): All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped, for every good work.\n \n And, Men spoke from God as they were borne along by the Holy Spirit...\n \n So that is the Christian authority for accepting God as the Author of the Bible. But of course, Christ's followers interpret it so many different ways, God can't be the author, otherwise he wouldn't allow it to be so interpreted.",

But reading the Bible (and going beyond those imposed strictures on how to read and understand it) has led to many Christians becoming former Christians.\n \n \n But back to my original point - which Bible? Since my deconversion, I still have had interest in religion, and have read all of the Protestant Canon and the apocrypha in English (thus the Catholic Canon). I read the other books of the Orthodox Canon, too. Gnostic canon.\n \n Read the Jewish Canon in English, much of it in Hebrew, a less in German and Greek. \n \n Haven't read the entire Ethiopian Christian Canon yet, but Enoch was a blast.\n \n I haven't focused on christianity, however - I've read many other \"Holy books\".\n \n I'm in between improving on my Sanskrit (for the Gita and other literature; the Vedas I read in translation only so far) and Punjabi (for the Sikh Shri Guru Granth Sahib). Wish I had time for Pali to bury myself in its Canon, but Chinese (for Buddhism, Confucianism and mainly Daoism) really takes its toll.\n I own and have downloaded and have read many of those scriptures, sometimes at least trying to concentrate on religions emerging in India.\n \n I'm about halfway through the Qur'an right now, but it's been a struggle - some parts are interesting, but others are quite boring.\n \n \n ******************\n \n In any case, I would never dismiss it as \"Bronze Age myth\"....\n \n Much of it is from the Iron age! ;)",

   "Most people I know use the New International Version or the Good News Bible. The Anglican chaplain where I worship prefers the Revised English Version (I think), but we use NIV in chapel because that's where the lectionary texts come from and is also the version distributed by the Gideons. I'd like to be able to do more than dip into the Greek and Hebrew but I don't have my Dad's gift for languages. Translation is always an issue, particularly when dealing with areas of controversy. You only have to talk to Jehovah's Witnesses to realise how much difference going at a translation with a goal in mind can make. The other problem of course is that there is barely a fixed version of the Greek and Hebrew texts, one only has to look at the notes in any Bible as regards the end of Mark's Gospel to see the problems.\n \n Can't say I've had a lot of guidance about how to read the Bible, only that it's a good idea but that any messages taken from it should be prayed about as it's entirely possible to take some pretty unchristian things from certain passages taken out of context.",

   "OK, I'll bite, EDO.\n \n I have read very little of the old testament apart from a passing, non-religious interest in what it said while I was a teenager.\n \n The reason? It's just never been a part of my life, it's never been important to me. I am aware that it informs much of our literary culture and I intend to read it cover to cover before my time here is over, much as I intend to read the Koran and other religious texts.\n \n The new testament I know a little better, because I went to Sunday School (don't know if you have same name for it in the US, but there must be similar things, it's for little kids to be indoctrinated into Christianity) when I was young. Not because my parents are religious, they just wanted me to have access to it so I could make my own mind up.\n \n I remember quite clearly, I must have been 8 or 9, realising that the whole 'God' thing was basically the same as the whole 'Santa Claus' thing. Honestly. I asked my parents at that age \"Why do people read this book?\" and they gave me a nice, ambiguous, good-parent answer along the lines of \"Well, no-one knows for sure\" etc. \n \n I think the key factor for me was talking to this kid at my school whose family were Hindu. I then asked my parents about this and discovered the panoply of world religions, at which point I realised I had no reason to believe any of them over the others. This made a massive, indelible impression on my developing mind.\n \n In response to your OP, I would not personally criticise the Bible itself (see I even automatically capitalize it!). However I can never understand people who see it as anything other than what it so obviously is: Just another ancient collection of poetic, romanticised history intertwined with allegorical morality tales and lists of rules drawn up by a small tribal culture, that by historical providence happens to be one of the few that has survived to the present in some form. \n \n So I do plan to read the thing, but I do not need to read it, any more than I need to read the Hindu Vedas or ancient Roman or Greek polytheistic philosophy, to know that it is just another cultural artefact, a testament to man's tribal and superstitious nature, a necessary cry for meaning in a world of irrational mysticism and ignorance.",

Where is the light coming from? Surely since there are only the heavens, which surround the earth, and God Himself, the light must be coming from God. But that doesn't make sense.

   "I don't know anyone who uses thou in spontaneous prayer. I know a lot of people (me included) find praying out loud quite hard, so it's tempting to fall back on words and phrases that you know; if you use thou a lot in worship then that is going to be in some of the phrases you use.\n \n Abba is the aramaic word Jesus used when he gave the disciples the Lord's prayer, it is a personal term rather than a formal one, a lot of Christians see it as symbolic of the child-parent relationship we have with God. \n\n \n Perhaps you have not heard it out loud, but I happen to have a few friends and relatives who insist on starting a meal by forcing all to join hands while some male (it is always a male) intones the blessing, replete with thou-ing and thy-ing. \n \n I participate so as to not create a scene (why is there no polite way to say, \"I really choose not to do this in my own dining room before a meal I prepared for you the guest and you are too presumptious to even ask if this is OK\"?). In case anyone out there reading this is ever stuck in a predicament like this, here is what I do: I bow my head and look at my watch and time them. It's fun. I have yet to see one of these droning blowhards keep it under 60 seconds. It's also fun to look around and make faces at the devout with their eyes closed in prayer, but this is dangerous. I am afraid of getting caught, but they never open their eyes. Also, if one of the fellow heathens sees this I am apt to giggle. Of course, it is also very difficult not to laugh at the grace-saying itself - Bless thy tacos Oh Lord! (I am not kidding.)\n \n Major digression, sorry. \n I will have to brush up on my Aramaic as well. It would always come in handy for a trip to Aramailand.

It is a barbaric practice which is only allowed because of religious sensibilities. The conventional method of slaughter does not permit that.\n \n'Forbidden to you (for food) are dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine and that over which has been invoked other than the name of ALLAH (s.w.t) that which has been killed by strangling or by a violent blow or by a headlong fall or by being gored to death; that which has been partly eaten by a wild animal, unless you are able to slaughter it (in due form) and that which is sacrificed on stone (altars).\n\n In Halal slaughter houses stunning is not a legal requirement so an animal may be fully concious as it bleeds.\n \nThe act of slaughter (Al-Dhabh) starts by pronouncing the name of ALLAH (s.w.t), The Creator (BISMILLAH ALLAHU AKBAR ), to take His permission and in order to make the Slaughter-man accountable and responsible and to give compassion and mercy to the animal during this act. Besides, any action we do in our daily life should be commenced with the mention of the name of ALLAH (s.w.t ) The Most Kind, The Most Merciful.Then, by a very, very sharp knife (which should be kept like a surgeon's knife in sharpness and cleanliness, as previously stated by DR Ghulam Khan (UFAW, 1971), a Deep swift cut done instantaneously and quickly to the blood vessels of the neck (the two caroid arteries which carry blood to the brain and head, the two jugular veins which bring blood from the brain back to the heart), the trachea (windpipe) and the oesophagus (gullet), but the central nervous system (the spinal cord) should be kept safe and intact (not cut).\n \n This deep, large cut through all the blood vessels of the neck causes acute blood loss and haemorrhagic shock: we know the blood is under great pressure , especially in the big carotid arteries (systolic pressure ) and at high speed and, according to physical law, the pressure always goes from the high to low resistance - the point of the cut is the scene of low resistance for blood to and from the brain. As we have a fully intact, alive heart, so most of the blood is going to be pumped and poured out instantaneously and quickly under pressure leading to a rapid fall in the blood pressure. Thus depriving the brain of its main source of oxygen and glucose, and with no blood which is necessary to keep the animal alive and functioning and able to deal with any perceptive sensation this leads to anoxia and almost immediate loss of consciousness (anesthetization or \"stunning\" ). The cerebrospinal fluid pressure falls even more rapidly than the blood pressure because of the jugular veins being cut, and this results in a deep shock and more loss of consciousness.\n",

   "I for one have not only read the bible but studied it as well in seminary. (No, I'm not a preacher/priest.)\n \n I am sure that those who wrote or scribed the bible were sincere people with their own \"bents\" on life. \n \n I see inspiration as a prisim. A prisim reflects true light into many colors. Although the light may be pure, each sees it in different colors depending upon your position to see it.\n \n There is a great deal of evidence pointing to the fact there are at least 2 creation stories in Genesis. It is believed by most theological scholars that the creation stories were a result of many scribes meeting together, trying to explain creation as they saw it. Some believed in the first story, others believed in the second story. So, both were captured in the book.\n \n The greatest problems with the scriptures are the readers of the scriptures. . .the fundamentalists who recite each and every verse as \"gospel.\" Facts are that when looking at history during that period many of the stories related to the then and there, not the future or now. Revelations can also be explained as well for that period, not for a future period.\n \n The book of Isaiah was written by at least two different writers. Most fundamentals disagree with this as well however, the scribes who wrote book referred to two completely different periods of history and again have two distinct writing styles.\n \n Many believe that John, the disciple wrote the Revelations.
