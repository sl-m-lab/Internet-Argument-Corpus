   "Violence Against Gays On The Rise\n \n by 365Gay.com Newscenter Staff \n \n Posted: April 26, 2005 8:30 pm ET \n (New York City) The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs released its annual report Tuesday on violence against lesbians, gay men, bisexual people and transgender individuals.\n \n The report was compiled by NCAVP and fifteen of its members across the country.\n \n NCAVP's report is the most complete examination of such violence against LGBT people. Each year, the FBI publishes its own report on hate crimes, which includes anti-LGBT incidents, but it consistently contains information on far fewer cases than the NCAVP publication because it relies on law enforcement reports of such crimes rather than victim service organization data.\n \n The 90-page report examines data compiled from almost 2,000 hate-related incidents in eleven cities, states and regions across the country: the Chicago area, Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, Colorado, Houston, Texas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, the New York City area, Pennsylvania and the San Francisco Bay area. Additional information was included from Kansas City and St. Louis, Missouri, Tucson, Arizona and Vermont.\n \n Overall, NCAVP's report noted a 4% increase in reported incidents of anti-LGBT violence. Such incidents rose from 1,720 in 2003 to 1,792 in 2004. \n \n Included in rise in incidents for the year, was an 11% increase in anti-LGBT murders, which rose from 18 in 2003 to 20 in 2004. During 2004, the total number of victims rose 4%, from 2,042 in 2003 to 2,131 in 2004. \n \n Of the eleven locations included in the report, eight reported increases in incidents. According to the report, the number of anti-LGBT violence offenders rose also rose, by 7%, from 2,467 to 2,637.\n \n According to NCAVP representatives, the data collected in for 2004 confirms that a dramatic rise in anti-LGBT hate incidents noted by the organization in the second half of 2003 continued unabated, and perhaps even worsened in throughout 2004.\n \n \"This year's report has to be viewed as a follow-up to our report from a year ago,\" said Clarence Patton, NCAVP's Acting Executive Director.\n \n \"In the last edition of this report it became all too clear that with respect to violence, the nation's LGBT communities had entered a very new, and very dangerous era in which all of us were under attack at levels not seen in recent years,\" Patton. said.\n \n NCAVP's report on hate violence in 2003 detailed the rapid shift and 26% increase in anti-LGBT violence as the nation responded politically and violently such victories for the community as the striking down of sodomy laws across the country and the right for same-sex couples to marry in Massachusetts.\n \n The 2004 report looks at the continuation of that atmosphere, which lasted through numerous anti-lesbian and gay state ballot initiatives, a Presidential call for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, and the demonization of lesbians and gay men in particular in the 2004 election cycle.\n \n The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force says the blame lies with conservative religious groups.\n \n \"The literal blood of the thousands of gay people physically wounded by hate during 2004 is on the hands of Jerry Falwell, James Dobson, Tony Perkins, and so many others who spew hate for partisan gain and personal enrichment,\" said NGLTF Executive Director Mat Foreman.\n \n \u00a9365Gay.com 2005",

   "Violence Against Gays On The Rise\n \n by 365Gay.com Newscenter Staff \n \n Posted: April 26, 2005 8:30 pm ET \n (New York City) The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs released its annual report Tuesday on violence against lesbians, gay men, bisexual people and transgender individuals.\n \n The report was compiled by NCAVP and fifteen of its members across the country.\n \n NCAVP's report is the most complete examination of such violence against LGBT people.

During 2004, the total number of victims rose 4%, from 2,042 in 2003 to 2,131 in 2004. \n\n \n Before we jump to any conclusions, this needs to be put in perspective. There were 1720 violent crimes against gay people in 2003, supposedly due to hate (though that's often hard to judge). But there were 1.4 million violent crimes committed period, in 2003 (http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/25/national/main651164.shtml?cmp=EM8706). That's a percentage of 0.12%. What that means is that among violent crimes overall, violent hate crime against gay people is very rare. There's no reason to believe 2004 would be any different in that regard.\n \n Other interesting facts from http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/03hc.pdf:\n \n - There are more incidents of crimes of hate against religious people in the U.S. than gay people\n \n - By far most hate crimes are over race or single-bias incidents\n \n - Among the crimes against gay people specifically, only 6 out of the 1430 crimes noted were murders. Most were \"simple assaults\" and \"intimidation\" (which is very hard to judge by evidence). \n \n \n\"In the last edition of this report it became all too clear that with respect to violence, the nation's LGBT communities had entered a very new, and very dangerous era in which all of us were under attack at levels not seen in recent years,\" Patton. said.\n\n \n A \"very, very dangerous era?\" Of course any violent crime is too much, but let's be realistic--it wasn't THAT much of a jump in the overall scheme of things.\n \n \nThe National Gay and Lesbian Task Force says the blame lies with conservative religious groups.\n\n \n Well, that was predictable. They blame just about everything bad in the world on religious conservatives, don't they? They probably think religious conservatives should be blamed for world hunger, tornados, tsunamis and eathquakes too. emoticon_rolleyes It's sad that these gay-lobby groups would take something like this and use it as a chance to lash out at groups THEY hate. If they put nearly as much effort into combatting violence against gay people as they do lashing out at conservatives at any given opportunity, they might start seeing some effective change for once.",

To oppose it would be like an Israelite jumping in the Red Sea to save one of Pharoah's chariotters.\n \n I do not believe the homosexual community deserves minority status.

(although he listed stats on the # partners one study showed gay men had - it did not list the same stats for lesbians or heterosexuals).\n \n They have been wounded by rejection and, in general, seem to say whatever it takes to be considered \"normal.\"\n \n And Dobson's propagation of misinformation on AIDS was declared \"despicable\" by former Surgeon General Everett Koop\n \n Tony Perkins:\n \n Nor is it \"loving\" to suppress evidence that homosexual behavior is a \"death-style\" that is sending young people to an early grave.\"\n \n \"...one of the primary goals of the homosexual rights movement is to abolish all age of consent laws and to eventually recognize pedophiles as the 'prophets' of a new sexual order.\" --\"Homosexual Behavior & Pedophilia,\" a FRC publication, July 1999\n \n Children raised in homosexual households are more likely to experiment with homosexuality, to be sexually promiscuous, and to have behavioral and many other developmental problems\n \n Dr. Laura\n \n Sexual deviations are not culture. They're sexual deviations.\n \n It's dysfunctional, it's deviant. According to religion it is not moral.

The reality is that homosexuality is not an illness. It does not require treatment and is not changeable.\" \n http://www.apa.org/pubinfo/answers.html#cantherapychange\n \n Some religious organisations also oppose reparative therapies, including The Interfaith Alliance, New Ways Ministries and People for the American Way.\n \n The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Counseling Association, American Association of School Administrators, American Federation of Teachers, American Psychological Association, American School Health Association, Interfaith Alliance Foundation, National Association of School Psychologists, National Association of Social Workers, and National Education Association have developed and endorsed a statement in 1999 reading: \n \n The most important fact about 'reparative therapy,' also sometimes known as 'conversion' therapy, is that it is based on an understanding of homosexuality that has been rejected by all the major health and mental health professions. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Counseling Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the National Association of School Psychologists, and the National Association of Social Workers, together representing more than 477,000 health and mental health professionals, have all taken the position that homosexuality is not a mental disorder and thus there is no need for a 'cure.' ...health and mental health professional organizations do not support efforts to change young people's sexual orientation through 'reparative therapy' and have raised serious concerns about its potential to do harm.  \n http://www.explore-sex.com/sex_and_romance/R/Reparative_therapy.html",

Are you saying that I'm lying about knowing the entire time that I was infact gay and that I was simply attempting to 'fit-in'? \n \n That's a very big ASSUMPTION on your part. You cannot know what I was feeling, or thinking. \n \n I really hate to tell you but abstaining from gay sex and having a \"straight style\" marriage does not prove sexual orientation change. I just proves a change in a persons actions. Orientation isn't about the act, it's about attraction, desire, a feeling of completeness/bond. Simply living in direct opposition to one's natural orientation is in fact living a lie. \n \n Shall I direct your attentions to the Director of the Board for Exodus International, John Paulk? He supposedly \"converted\" to being straight, but later was found perusing a gay bar in the DuPont Circle area of Washing DC in 2000. He was later put on probation by Exodus and subsequently \"came back out\" admitting he had never actually been \"changed\" but only that he chose to live in opposition to his natural orientation.\n \n Or\n \n Seventh Day Adventist Colin Cook (who had been dismissed as a minister in 1974 for having sex with another man) founded the groups Quest Learning Center and Homosexuals Anonymous in 1979 and 1980 respectively; both are ex-gay organizations. In 1985, he wrote two books, Homosexuality, and Homosexuality: An Open Door. In 1986, he was discovered to be engaging in sexual acts with his Quest patients. He claimed that the nude massages of other men should desensitize them against homosexual desires.\n \n Not to mention the APA's stand on the issue: \n http://www.apa.org/pubinfo/answers.html\n \n \nNo, human beings can not choose to be either gay or straight. Sexual orientation emerges for most people in early adolescence without any prior sexual experience. Although we can choose whether to act on our feelings, psychologists do not consider sexual orientation to be a conscious choice that can be voluntarily changed. \n\n and...\n \nSome therapists who undertake so-called conversion therapy report that they have been able to change their clients' sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual. Close scrutiny of these reports however show several factors that cast doubt on their claims. For example, many of the claims come from organizations with an ideological perspective which condemns homosexuality. Furthermore, their claims are poorly documented. For example, treatment outcome is not followed and reported overtime as would be the standard to test the validity of any mental health intervention.\n \n The American Psychological Association is concerned about such therapies and their potential harm to patients. In 1997, the Association's Council of Representatives passed a resolution reaffirming psychology's opposition to homophobia in treatment and spelling out a client's right to unbiased treatment and self-determination. Any person who enters into therapy to deal with issues of sexual orientation has a right to expect that such therapy would take place in a professionally neutral environment absent of any social bias. \n",

   "\"PROOF\" that gays can change their orientation:\n \n http://www.libchrist.com/other/homosexual/cure.html\n \n \nOne Group that claims to be able to change homosexuals is Exodus Ministry. I wonder, why doesn't Exodus Ministry tell the public about its male co-founders. No, if they did that then everybody would know that those \"changed\" men fell in love with each other and renounced the organization! No, Exodus doesn't need to tell the public that, there are already plently of us who are not going to let that remain a secret (see the book \"One Nation Under God\"). Apparently, they were only fooling themselves as well as others by claiming to have changed. \n \n Kent Philpott led an \"ex-gay\" movement called \"Love in Action\" and wrote a book called \"The Third Sex?\"- In the book he claimed to have changed a group of homosexuals into heterosexuals. After the book was published, the alleged \"ex-homosexuals\", of whom the book discussed, SUED him publishing false information about them... Every one who was said to have changed, told the judge that they had never changed (they won the case by the way. The book cannot be published in the US. anymore. But sadly it is still being circulated in England, the public of whom is suprisingly unaware of these events.) \n \n Another \"ex-gay\", John Paulk, wrote articles for Focus on the Family. He wrote the usual garbage on how homosexuals not only can* change but ought to. But ya know what? He was caught in a gar bar in washington D.C., afterwards admited that he was still gay! He had been writing articles saying that homosexuals are not born that way, that they can and should change, and that he himself had changed and decided to choose heterosexuality- he did all of this and at the very same time remained gay! \n \n\n \n \n\"I know of nobody who has changed from homosexual to heterosexual. I know nobody else who knows anyone whose sexual orientation has been changed. I know many people who have been profoundly hurt and driven to self destructive behavior because of attempts, including electric shock therapy, to change their sexual orientation. The Ex-Gay Movement is a fraud without any credible scientific research to support claims to change homosexuals to heterosexuals.\" ~ Rembert Truluck, Doctor of Theology from Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Louisville, KY. \n",

   "In 1973 John Evans, who is gay, and Rev. Kent Philpott, who is heterosexual, co-founded the original \"ex-gay\" ministry, Love In Action on the outskirts of San Francisco. Philpott soon wrote The Third Sex?, the first ever \"ex-gay\" book which touted six people who supposedly converted to heterosexuality through prayer. \n \n Although time eventually revealed no one in his book actually had changed, the people reading it had no idea the stories were fallacious. As far as they knew, there was a magical place in California that had figured out the secret for making gays into straights. Inspired by his book, a few enthusiastic individuals spontaneously began their own \"ex-gay\" ministries. \n \n Evans, however, denounced the program he co-founded after his best friend Jack McIntyre committed suicide in despair over not being able to \"change\". Still, Love in Action survived because many people who read The Third Sex? came to California in hopes of changing. \n \n As a result of Philpott's book, within three years more than a dozen \"ex-gay\" ministries organically sprung up across America. As these ministries serendipitously became aware of each other, two leading \"ex-gay\" counselors at Melodyland Christian Center in Anaheim, California - Gary Cooper and Michael Bussee - decided to organize a conference where the \"ex-gays\" could meet each other and network. \n \n In September 1976, Cooper and Bussee's vision came to fruition as sixty-two \"ex-gays\" journeyed to Melodyland for the world's first \"ex-gay\" conference. The outcome of the retreat was the formation of Exodus International, an umbrella organization for \"ex-gay\" groups worldwide.\n \n The early Exodus meetings almost disintegrated the group because participants kept sleeping with each other. The group was rocked to its core a few years later when Bussee and Cooper acknowledged that they had not changed and were in love with each other. They soon divorced their wives, moved in together and eventually held a commitment ceremony.\n \n In 1979, Seventh Day Adventist minister Colin Cook founded Homosexuals Anonymous (HA). But Cook's \"ex-gay\" empire crumbled a few years later after he was scandalized for having phone sex and giving nude massages to those he was supposedly helping become heterosexual. \n \n As acceptance for homosexuality grew in the late 1970's, the \"ex-gay\" ministries had trouble attracting new recruits and growth of these programs stagnated. Then came AIDS. Unscrupulous ministry leaders were able to use the threat of AIDS to scare people into entering \"ex-gay\" ministries. \n \n However, even as the epidemic spurred new growth, the \"ex-gay\" ministries remained relatively obscure in mainstream society. This dramatically changed in 1998 when the politically motivated Religious Right jumped on the \"ex-gay\" bandwagon launching a multi-million dollar newspaper and television ad campaign. They featured groups like Exodus because the traditional fire and brimstone rhetoric of the far right political groups made them seem mean-spirited and intolerant. By embracing the \"ex-gays\", hateful men like Revs. D. James Kennedy, Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson could claim they loved homosexuals and were just trying to help them. \n \n But the ad campaign soon backfired after University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard was murdered because he was gay. The groups who sponsored the anti-gay ads were held largely responsible for creating a climate where hate crimes, such as the Shepard incident, could flourish. Although these groups denied a connection, because of the negative fallout they postponed their \"ex-gay\" television ads for several months and the campaign lost steam. \n \n Additionally, several of the \"ex-gays\" they paraded as proof of \"change\" were uncovered as frauds. The biggest example was \"ex-gay\" poster boy John Paulk who the ad campaign sponsors put on the cover of Newsweek with his \"ex-lesbian\" wife Anne under the large headline, \"Gay for Life?\" But in September 2000 Paulk was photographed cruising in a Washington, DC gay bar and was suspended as Chairman of Exodus and put on a temporary \"hiatus\" by Focus on the Family, where he ran their \"Love Won Out\" program.\n \n The \"ex-gay\" ministries are still growing today despite their history of scandals and failures. The sad truth is, as long as people are made to hate themselves for being gay, these groups will exist. The best way to counter their negative influence is by highlighting the truth and revealing the failed history that \"ex-gay\" groups represent. Showing an honest portrayal of gay life also greatly diminishes the effectiveness of these groups. When people learn that God loves them for who they are and that they can be gay and happy, the appeal of these dangerous groups invariably wanes. \n http://www.anythingbutstraight.com/learn/eghistory.html",

Is their political movement seriously so threatened by this, that they work to expose people who go to bars, reporting it to the media, and then take any given opportunity they can to vilify anyone who has claimed to change by such accsations as \"he's a hack\" or \"it's just for the money\"? For a group of people who demand so much that people take them at their word, why is taking one person at their word that they may have done it so god-awful???? I mean, one would think if their arguments are so airtight, it's just not going to matter much, let alone warrant the amount of efforts on their part to go after these few people. emoticon_frazzled\n\n \n What I don't get is why you think we should or would even WANT to change. emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Your right, but if the killing was done as a hate baised crime there should be stiffer penalties. If the heterosexual was killed by a gay person, just for being heterosexual there should be a stiffer penalty. You see when a gay person is beaten to a pulp (like I was..baseball bats) it is only considered an assult. The penalty in most states is small. A few months in prison and probation. With a hate crime law in place that same assult would become a few years in prison. \n \n When teenagers are going arounf \"XXXXX bashing\" for kicks on Friday night (which yes, this really happens) there needs to be stiffer penalties to discourage this.\n \n It is the same thing as having stiffer penalties for killing a police officer.\n\n \n Joe, I think what is needed are stiffer penalties for anybody who goes around bashing people with baseball bats. How is it that when anyone is beaten within inches of their lives, the person committing the crime is allowed to get off with a few months in jail? Isn't there something wrong with a justice system which would allow for that? \n \n I think hate crime legislation is unnecessary but what is necessary are punishments which fit the crime. I'm a bicyclist...I ride thousands of miles a year out on the highways. It's possible that one day somebody is going to come along and slam me into a ditch simply because they don't like or they 'hate' bicyclists. I don't expect any special punishment for them. I do expect that (if there is a witness) our justice system would come down hard on the person because of the way they endangered my life. Actually, in today's environment I would doubt the justice system would do much if anything. \n \n Our judiciary has become a joke in so many ways. I understand that the U.S. incarcerates a higher percentage of its population than most other developed countries...at least that's what I usually hear when I suggest that we don't incarcerate enough people. Build more prisons if that's what it takes to get the message across that violence of any kind won't be tolerated. I'd gladly pay more taxes to see that happen.

   "A hate crime is a criminal act against a person or his/her property targeted because of that person's real or perceived race, color, religion, nationality, country of origin, disability, gender or sexual orientation. Under California law, for a crime to be considered a hate crime, a number of specific criteria must all be met as defined in the California code. Federal law differs in certain respects from state law. In California, for a crime to be considered a \"hate crime\" and for the penalty enhancement provisions of the law to take effect, a prosecutor must prove that the motivation of the perpetrator in committing the crime was bias against a person or persons in a protected category, and that this bias was a \"substantial factor\" (and not an incidental factor) in the crime. Hate incidents are considerably more common on college campuses than hate crimes. Unlike hate crimes, there is no formal legal definition for a hate incident. They are generally the same types of behaviors and crimes as described above except that one or more of the formal legal criteria described above are not met. Regardless, the victims tend to experience the same range of emotions and benefit from the same level of caring response. When you are aware that a student has experienced a hate incident or hate crime:\n http://www.sa.ucsb.edu/distressedstudentsguide/whosthevictim/hatecrimeorhate.asp",

I would have to believe that gay men who show their efeminate side simply don't have the fear of their emotions which are so heavily stressed in straight society. It's a way of acting out. \n Not all gay men do act efeminate though. \n Some men who do act efeminate are not gay.\n \n Case in point.\n I these two friends, both are male, one is gay and the other straight. The really funny part is that the gay one is very reserved emotionally. He displays no efeminate tendencies whatsoever. While the straight one does. My straight male friend is over the top in his display of emotion and drama. \n Both these men are involved in theatre, both men know each other and have worked with each other. \n Those of us who know both of them actually see it as amusing as well as refreshing. \n Both these men break the stereotypes of both sexual orientations. \n It's a beautiful thing.",
