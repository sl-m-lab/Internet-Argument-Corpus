The gathering is, in the words of economist Michael Hudson, the most important meeting of the 21st century so far.\n \n It is the first formal step by our major trading partners to replace the dollar as the world's reserve currency. If they succeed, the dollar will dramatically plummet in value, the cost of imports, including oil, will skyrocket, interest rates will climb and jobs will hemorrhage at a rate that will make the last few months look like boom times. State and federal services will be reduced or shut down for lack of funds. The United States will begin to resemble the Weimar Republic or Zimbabwe. Obama, endowed by many with the qualities of a savior, will suddenly look pitiful, inept and weak.

That might not be sustainable long term. Their growth has also come at a cost of high polution and social imbalances that they have yet to properly address. \n \n Russia and Brazil are relatively small economies that, to my unprofessional eye, do not show nearly as much growth potential despite their relatively low debt ratio. Russia is not diversified enough in its industry (oil revenue dominates). Perhaps Brazil is better placed - I haven't heard much about their economy.\n \n Also, if you look at the links that I posted (calculating external debt / GDP), though our external debt is about 85% of GDP, Germany's is ~157% of GDPs. The UKs and that of France is also much higher than ours - 468% and 256%, respectively.

The only question I have is whether the stimulus was done in the right way - too much?, too little?, of the right type? There seems to be no consensus among economists.

   "I didn't hear them predicting the current crisis, so what does that tell you? What does it mean to be a mainstream economist? To be wrong 99% of the time? To provide superficial explanations for things after the fact?\n\n I don't know where you've been but there certainly had been predictions of the current crisis over the last years in that there were many economists warning that the housing boom would bust. The only question in most economist minds was when it would happen. I've had many friends who were holding off on buying a house in the last few few years because of these warnings. Unfortunately, this did not translate into sufficient action on the part of the politicians.\n \nConsumption isn't growth. Maybe in some keynesian fantasy-land this is true, but real growth means\n \n a) Investment in capital goods\n b) Specialisation of labour\n \n That's it. Borrowing money and spending it on consumption goods is not \"growth\", any more than taking out 10 credit cards and going to the strip club means you're \"rich\". If China didn't lend the US money to buy Chinese goods, where do you think it would have gone? Would the wealth have vanished into air?\n \n Of course not - it would have been spent by the Chinese, or invested by the Chinese.\n \n As Peter Schiff puts it\n \n\n Our TOTAL foreign debt - accumulated through all of US history (though mostly through the last couple of decades) - is ~$12 trillion - or about 85% of GDP. Here is an interesting graph showing foreign debt / GDP from 1940 to today: U.S. National Debt Graph: Since Great Depression .Though I don't have the numbers, this graph suggests that, apart from the ~10-15% increase in foreign debt due to the latest stimulus packages, the foreign debt added per year is much less - only a small fraction of our GDP. Though some of our spending comes from borrowed money from China (and other foreign countries) and from our foreign trade, most of our GDP is internally generated. My understanding is that China is far more dependent on foreign countries for its growth and GDP. This can be sustainable only as long as those foreign countries tolerate the trade imbalance.\n \n I am not saying that our growth was not helped by our foreign debt. I am saying that our GDP is much more independent of foreign countries than China's so China is far more vulnerable to changes in trading rules in the world. However, most countries are allowing China to get away with the trade imbalance so I am sure it will continue to grow as long as those rules are not changed.\n \nSorry he isn't a mainstream economist, but he predicted this crisis, and got rich doing it. You can find hundreds of clips of him doing this on youtube. Who would you rather listen to, him, or the ###### that told you house prices were going to rise forever?\n \n Krugman's the democrat's favourite 'mainstream economist', you can find this clown's genius insights into the economy in my signature. Unfortunately there isn't enough space there to fit in the dozens of times where he called for a fed-induced housing bubble to set things right in the world, or hammered Greenspan for not cutting interest rates low enough or fast enough. Good call on that one, there's someone I'll be sure to take advice from.\n\n Once again, a lot of economists were predicting a bust in the housing bubble. The main question was WHEN. Just because politicians did not do much about it doesn't mean that they weren't warned by economists. So, your pet economist predicting a housing bust is not particularly impressive.\n \n As a scientist, I have most trust in scientific consensus since I know fully well that there are crackpot theories out there that are held dear by even the most credited of scientists. Consensus tends to weed out the crackpots. I view economics the same way. If a few stray economists out of the mainstream warn of a dire future, then I ignore them. Only once some critical mass of such dire prediction is exceeded do I start to listen. That critical mass has certainly not been exceeded.",

Growth is not the same thing as consumption. One reason Japan is not totally in the crapper is because the people and companies there are flush with cash so they can invest in things. \n \n \nWhat do you mean by \"borrow 50 cents on the dollar\"? \nI mean that the federal government has revenues of slightly over $2 trillion this year and expenditures of $4 trillion this year.

It didn't work too hot for the Romans.\n \n \nOur debt is half of theirs (compared to GDP) and is comparable to many European countries (ok, that is the Eurocentrist in me again).\nAnd? This number is not a great indicator of whether or not a national debt is a problem. I could go into reasons why but Japan is much better off than the US and they are in crappy shape. Japan actually owns 23% of the US debt. \n \n \nWhat makes you think that the stimulus did not save the economy? The fact that the Bush administration passed a stimulus package despite its own strong ideological oposition, as well as the fact that most countries had their own stimulus packages, convinces me that they were presented with very convincing arguements. What opposing convincing arguements are you presenting?\nThe fact that it didn't work in Japan for 10 years. The fact that the Bush stimulus did nothing but provide a slight boost in consumption for a quarter. The fact that 6% of the current stimulus has been released (not really spend and in the system) and yet people are saying the worst is over. The fact that Obama's OWN CHART shows unemployment would have leveled off long ago thanks to the stimulus and not continue on the upward trend (shown in the graph as unemployment if not passed) and yet unemployment stayed the course. The fact that no real infrastructure upgrades have been done to boost an economy so how is that supposed to jump start?\n \n I mean we can go on for days but Obama and Bush were wrong and have hurt our country because of it. The dollar is stinking it up and China is basically the new superpower. \n \n \nThe debt is an increasing problem but I just don't yet see it as huge and I haven't seen a consensus among economists that says that it is indeed huge.\n Economists are the only ones to ask and many say it is a problem. For 10 years the GAO has stated: As discussed in this 2008 Financial Report, the federal government is on an unsustainable long-term fiscal path. The federal government faces increasing pressures yet a shrinking window of opportunity for phasing in adjustments.\n \n Considering the GAO has a remarkable track record I don't think it is wise to question them and accept the economists who said a $500,000 McMansion was a good investment.",

   "Symbiote had a good response to this. I'll just add that it isn't a dire prediction but common sense. Surely you understand the concept that you can't just spend fake money forever. \n\n The great majority of money we spend as a country or government is real money, not fake money (I am assuming you mean borrowed money). There is more \"fake\" money this year because of the stimulus packages but these large stimulus packages are spikes in an otherwise more continuous landscape of borrowing - as seen by the chart that I linked in my response to Symbiote. So, the amount of \"fake\" money we spend most years is quite small compared to \"real\" money. A comparison that I saw that made sense was that, if one earns $100k/year and has a $100k loan, that is very tolerable. If one only earns $30k/year, then $100k loan is much harder to manage. If you borrow $10k a year then you will certainly get into trouble, but that is not what we are doing.\n \nAnother good response from Symbiote. Growth is not the same thing as consumption. One reason Japan is not totally in the crapper is because the people and companies there are flush with cash so they can invest in things. \n\n When I said that most of our growth is internal, I mis-spoke since I really meant that most of our GDP is internal. China's growth may not be due to borrowing but both their growth and the majority of their GDP is based on foreign trade, with only a minority of their GDP generated by their internal market. So, if the international market destabilizes or clamps down on free trade, then they would be far more vulnerable than we are in the US since our GDP is largely generated by our internal market. For the time being, it doesn't look like that will happen, so China can continue to fly high. I'm just not sure whether that would be sustainable long term - especially if their standard of living goes up enough for their products to no longer be dirt cheap.\n \nI mean that the federal government has revenues of slightly over $2 trillion this year and expenditures of $4 trillion this year. So for every dollar of revenue we have a dollar of debt. How long is it possible to do this? It didn't work too hot for the Romans.\n\n Again, if you look at the chart I linked in my response to Symbiote, this year is an exception in terms of the sudden jump in borrowing. So, yes, this year, we may be spending twice as much as we earn. However, I haven't seen anyone in the mainstream arguing that we need even MORE stimulus packages. So, this year is a fluke. Most years, we are far closer to earning that full dollar that we spend. \n \n Also, throughout the 50s to 70s, as well as in the 90s, we were able to pay down the large foreign debt that was accumulated by FDR in WWII and by Reagan and George H.W. Bush in the 80s/early 90s. Granted, these were boom years that we cannot always count on - especially the 50s to 70s when most of our competitors were still recovering from WWII - but I am not so pessimistic as to think that we will never again hit a surplus which can be used to pay down debt.\n \nThe fact that it didn't work in Japan for 10 years. The fact that the Bush stimulus did nothing but provide a slight boost in consumption for a quarter. The fact that 6% of the current stimulus has been released (not really spend and in the system) and yet people are saying the worst is over. The fact that Obama's OWN CHART shows unemployment would have leveled off long ago thanks to the stimulus and not continue on the upward trend (shown in the graph as unemployment if not passed) and yet unemployment stayed the course.

Either way, it is hard to judge how bad things might have been if actions hadn't been taken. I can only judge by Black Tuesday when proper actions were not taken vs. all the actions taken in this latest crisis by various countries that seems to have forestalled another banking collapse.\n \n Economists are the only ones to ask and many say it is a problem.

The federal government faces increasing pressures yet a shrinking window of opportunity for phasing in adjustments.\n \n Considering the GAO has a remarkable track record I don't think it is wise to question them and accept the economists who said a $500,000 McMansion was a good investment.\n\n Though some economists were riding the wave, many were raising alarms that eventually the housing bubble would crash. It is the difference between those that look short term and want short term profits vs. those economists that had the long-term picture in mind. Both optimistic and pessimistic predictions were being told in the early 2000s, not just the optimistic predictions.\n \n All in all, we both agree that debt is a problem. We mostly just disagree about how much of a problem it currently is. Since I haven't heard too many mainstream economists raise strong alarm bells about the debt as it currently stands, then I trust their view that our debt is still sustainable. I find your rhethoric largely exaggerated.",

   "I don't know where you've been but there certainly had been predictions of the current crisis over the last years in that there were many economists warning that the housing boom would bust. \n\n \n Who? The \"mainstream\" economists were busy coming up with explanations as to why high housing prices were fundamentally sound, why they would eventually \"plateau\" rather than plummet, and why if they did plummet, the losses would be \"confined\" and not spread into the \"real economy\". Many were demanding lower interest rates to push house prices higher still.\n \n Did Greenspan warn of a housing bubble? Bernanke? Anyone?\n \n \nOur TOTAL foreign debt - accumulated through all of US history (though mostly through the last couple of decades) - is ~$12 trillion - or about 85% of GDP. Here is an interesting graph showing foreign debt / GDP from 1940 to today:\n\n \n And over the next 10 years it will surpass $20 trillion, assuming the economy recovers, assuming there are no new stimulus packages, no new grandiose plans on the part of our glorious leaders, assuming there are no new wars, with no realistic plan to reduce the deficits after that. In fact with all the unfunded liabilities (Hello social security) it will only get worse. Undoubtedly this 20 trillion figure is also understated.\n \n Why would you keep lending to someone whose plan to manage their finances is to keep borrowing more from you, forever?\n \n \nThough some of our spending comes from borrowed money from China (and other foreign countries) and from our foreign trade, most of our GDP is internally generated.\n\n \n Without that borrowing, what would America's GDP growth have been over the last 10 years - 0%? After adjusting for real inflation, -3% per year?\n \n \nMy understanding is that China is far more dependent on foreign countries for its growth and GDP. \n\n \n Historically, yes, however given its industry is actually free to fail, if international trade dried up it could convert to domestic consumption in a matter of months, not years. The issue China has to face is potential political instability in those first few months when the export companies cut back and shut down.

Only once some critical mass of such dire prediction is exceeded do I start to listen. That critical mass has certainly not been exceeded.\n\n \n That's not how economics works.

Many were demanding lower interest rates to push house prices higher still.\n \n Did Greenspan warn of a housing bubble? Bernanke? Anyone?\n\n I grant that most of the early warnings were that the housing prices would plateau and that no mainstream economist, at least early on, was predicting how hard it would hit the economy overall, but I heard many voices of economists (on NPR and otherwise) who were warning in the early 2000s that the fast rise in housing prices could not last. If those voices had been heeded by the government and markets, then it might have been easier to convince homebuyers that, no, they cannot afford that house because the forecasters of infinite growth are lying to you. By 2006, more voices started warning of a housing bust. \n \n Either way, the rhetoric I hear about the dangers of the current debt sound very overstated. It is not \"sky is falling\" as many would try to profess. These exaggerated arguements continue to be utterly unconvincing. Is debt a problem? Yes. How much of a problem? Enough to pay attention to it but far from the level of forecasting doom.\n \nAnd over the next 10 years it will surpass $20 trillion, assuming the economy recovers, assuming there are no new stimulus packages, no new grandiose plans on the part of our glorious leaders, assuming there are no new wars, with no realistic plan to reduce the deficits after that. In fact with all the unfunded liabilities (Hello social security) it will only get worse. Undoubtedly this 20 trillion figure is also understated.\n\n It is not the absolute number that is as important to me as the debt as percentage of GDP. Obama's predictions are that, in 2010, the debt will rise to ~97% of GDP and stay around 100% of GDP afterwards. I am not happy about that but, so far, I continue to believe that the stimulus packages that pushed us over the 80% mark were necessary to avert a new Depression - which would have been far worse. As has been shown historically, debt doesn't stay around forever. In our history (50s to 70s, and 90s), we have been able to reduce the debt as percentage of GDP - either by actually paying off debt or by having GDP grow faster than that debt with interest. It is not inconceivable that we will similarly be able to reduce debt in the future. My only concern is to limit added debt as much as possible by restricting deficits to times when they are truly necessary - i.e. to get us out of Recession.\n \n As for underfunded entitlements, yes, that is a problem that, as a Generation Xer, I am also worried about. I suspect that, as usual, this problem will only be addressed once the problem is accute. There is just too much political liability involved in trying to significantly increase Social Security / Medicare taxes or to reduce benefits. Either way, that will have to be done. The longer we wait, the worse the problem will be but, given our political system, I think that is inevitable.\n \nWhy would you keep lending to someone whose plan to manage their finances is to keep borrowing more from you, forever?\n\n The US doesn't borrow forever. In the 50s-70s and in the 90s we actually reduced debt per GDP. Also, if I know that my money is safe (i.e. the debt won't be just cancelled), if I won't need it for many years, and if my lending it gives me some control over the actions of the person I lend it to, then I can continue enjoying the interest payments while feeling relatively safe that my money won't disappear.\n \nWithout that borrowing, what would America's GDP growth have been over the last 10 years - 0%? After adjusting for real inflation, -3% per year?\n\n As I mentioned to Steeeeve, when I first said that most of our growth was internal, I mis-spoke since I meant that most of our GDP was internal (unlike China's). In the current situation of global trade, that makes China grow much faster than us. However, if global trade gets largely restructured, then China would be more vulnerable than us - that is my main point. Will that happen? Not in the foreseeable future but it seems that I hear more and more disgruntled views around the world against free trade in favor of \"fair\" trade, so you never know what the future might bring on that front.\n \nHistorically, yes, however given its industry is actually free to fail, if international trade dried up it could convert to domestic consumption in a matter of months, not years. The issue China has to face is potential political instability in those first few months when the export companies cut back and shut down. They'll be happy to spend their own money once they get to keep it.\n\n How much of their money, compared to their GDP, are you claiming that they lend out? From our debt (as of Sept 2008, from United States public debt - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ), the total amount of our debt owned by \"foreign and international\" was ~$2.8 trillion - of which China only owns part and that part has been accumulated over many years. That suggests to me that the amount that China lends is quite small compared to their GDP so it will not make much of a dent in their GDP if they stop lending. Do you have numbers to refute this?\n ---------\n On edit: Here is an up-to-date link showing the amount of our US debt owned by various countries: http://www.ustreas.gov/tic/mfh.txt , with historical tables further back at http://www.ustreas.gov/tic/mfhhis01.txt . As of April 2009, China owns $763.5 billion of our debt. Since April 2008, when they owned $502 billion, that debt has increased by $261.5 billion. Out of their ~$7.8 trillion GDP, that constitutes ~3% - for a year that showed a large spike in borrowing. In April 2007, China owned $414.2 trillion of our debt - so from 4/2007 to 4/2008, it increased by much less ($85.8 billion) than from 4/2008 to 4/2009 ($261.5 billion). Making a list of added debt by year, this years spike becomes obvious, as does the fact that we didn't start seriously borrowing from China until the Bush administration. It also shows that only a small fraction of China's GDP is loaned out (even if you multiply the debt to the US by three as a guess at world lending) so a loss of foreign trade would not be covered by China \"keeping their money\". No matter what, their economy is very largely dependent on the continuation of the foreign trade imbalance.\n \n The list of added debt from China is by April (listed year) from April (previous year), in billions of dollars:\n \n 2009 $261.5\n 2008 $85.8\n 2007 $93.1\n 2006 $80.9\n 2005 $76.3\n 2004 $29.9\n 2003 $51.6\n 2002 $13.2\n 2001 -$2.5 (i.e. we payed off some of the earlier debt)\n the tables don't go earlier than 2000, where we only owed a sum total of $71.7 billion to China in April 2000.\n ---------\n \nWhere's the US going to find cheap goods with china gone, are americans suddenly going to start working for $0.50 an hour making t-shirts?\n\n It surprises me that you say this. Don't you realize how many countries in the world also offer cheap labor? Also, there are many types of goods where labor (at least the unskilled manufacturing labor) is only a small part of the total cost or where automation is cheaper.\n \nIt isn't \"getting away\" with anything, the fact China produces more than it consumes isn't some moral outrage America has to begrudgingly tolerate, the US is completely dependent on this.\n\n It isn't a \"moral outrage\" but we cannot let US manufacturing jobs hemorage forever to countries with cheaper labor - there are just too many unskilled people in the US that would be left out in the cold. That is why there needs to be some balance - not fully free trade, in my view. Most countries seem to have some protections built into their trade laws. We, instead, so often chant the mantra of free trade in a playing field where other countries often don't practice it. \n \nThat's not how economics works. I'm not sure how much you covered off philosophy of science, but Economists are not independent observers, they are part of the system that they are trying to explain.\n \n If there were a \"consensus\" that the stock market would crash on the 1st July 2011, everyone would sell their stock on the 30th of June - of course, the smarter ones would realise this would happen and sell on the 29th of June, and so on until the crash was brought forward to the point where the consensus was arrived at, the mere fact a popular prediction exists inevitably proves it wrong.\n \n Aside from any methodological disputes amongst various schools of economics, and the empirical reality that economic consensus has never predicted any major economic event, the observer effect alone completely invalidates this approach.\n\n Granted that there are many economists who are willing to ignore evidence and state views purely out of self-interest derived from their own participation in the system. However, many economists in Universities and other less-involved locations simply want to give the best forecast they can. Economics is far less of an exact science but that doesn't mean that there aren't basic ideas and structures that can be recognized. It was clear that housing prices couldn't continue to rise at that rate forever since people would eventually not be able to afford them. That's economics 101. The trick, as a layman observer, was to try to find those economists who one could trust to be more honest in their appraisal and whose areguements were not shunned as absurd (as opposed to simply ignored) by most other economists.",

If you borrow $10k a year then you will certainly get into trouble, but that is not what we are doing.\nThe US government makes 2 Trillion one year and spends 3 trillion. The next year it makes 2 trillion and spends 4 trillion. So forth and so on. You look at it like we are taking out one mortgage one time but in reality we are taking out higher loans each year in a Madoff type Ponzi scheme. So right now we making $2 trillion a year with a $11 trillion loan that is ever increasing. The people you read this from might be the ones that thought interest only loans were a good idea.\n \n \nWhen I said that most of our growth is internal, I mis-spoke since I really meant that most of our GDP is internal. China's growth may not be due to borrowing but both their growth and the majority of their GDP is based on foreign trade, with only a minority of their GDP generated by their internal market.

For the time being, it doesn't look like that will happen, so China can continue to fly high. I'm just not sure whether that would be sustainable long term - especially if their standard of living goes up enough for their products to no longer be dirt cheap.\nThis is true, China does rely on exporting which is unhealthy for your own countries people. China will continue this with the US until it is unprofitable to do so. If China has to give us more money than it takes in from exports they will just cut their losses and run. With them already calling for an international currency I think we are getting closer to the tipping point. \n \n \nAgain, if you look at the chart I linked in my response to Symbiote, this year is an exception in terms of the sudden jump in borrowing. So, yes, this year, we may be spending twice as much as we earn. However, I haven't seen anyone in the mainstream arguing that we need even MORE stimulus packages. So, this year is a fluke. Most years, we are far closer to earning that full dollar that we spend. \nEating these words now? Haha, I had to :). As you might have noticed we have Warren Buffet, a person who advises Obama among other things, has called for a second stimulus package. \n \n \nAlso, throughout the 50s to 70s, as well as in the 90s, we were able to pay down the large foreign debt that was accumulated by FDR in WWII and by Reagan and George H.W. Bush in the 80s/early 90s. Granted, these were boom years that we cannot always count on - especially the 50s to 70s when most of our competitors were still recovering from WWII - but I am not so pessimistic as to think that we will never again hit a surplus which can be used to pay down debt.\nOur debt wasn't a big deal until the 90s. Furthermore, it wasn't even that big during the 50s and 70s so paying it off was easy with our massive production during that time. \n \n \nMy understanding is also that Obama's stimulus package hasn't kicked in much yet but I thought that Bush's stimulus package largely had - or have you understood differently? Either way, it is hard to judge how bad things might have been if actions hadn't been taken. I can only judge by Black Tuesday when proper actions were not taken vs. all the actions taken in this latest crisis by various countries that seems to have forestalled another banking collapse.\nIf this is the Bush package kicking in than brace yourself for the Obama stimulus package. If $168 billion buys you 9.5% unemployment than what will $800 billion do! \n \n My point is Obama claimed one thing about the stimulus package and frankly he failed. It called for unemployment to start leveling off back in early May under 8.% and now we are at 9.5% and still climbing. What makes you think he will be right starting now? Furthermore, do you understand the cost to comply with the stimulus bill? This is where the job creation is going to be. I work with universities a lot and they are hiring consultants for months just to understand the reporting requirements. It is costing taxpayers millions just to comply with the law. \n \n Also, you claim it is hard to judge how bad things would have been but who is to say it would have been worse or better? This kind of fallacy is often used by Obama and others. \n \n \n \nAll in all, we both agree that debt is a problem. We mostly just disagree about how much of a problem it currently is. Since I haven't heard too many mainstream economists raise strong alarm bells about the debt as it currently stands, then I trust their view that our debt is still sustainable. I find your rhethoric largely exaggerated.\nIt isn't my rhetoric. That is the GAO...not exactly a biased agency. Furthermore, economists aren't the ones to judge these things. It is an appeal to authority fallacy because the \"authority\" you cite has no real authority on the matter. Economists are not accountants and for good reason. Furthermore, I'd like to see just what economists you see that say the debt is no big deal. Finally, just look at it from a common sense point of view. If you personally increase your debt every year and use more debt to pay the old debt than do you think you will declare bankruptcy in your lifetime? Why do you feel the federal government is any different? How are we different than the Romans? \n \n Now, if your argument is \"well we never really look in the long term anyway so why bother now\" than I'd agree with you on that. I don't think you can really convince Americans of something that doesn't happen within 30 seconds. However, you can trick the American public and get things done quickly before it really does take a long time to fix. The key is to find a good solution that you can claim is helping immediately and will save them money right away. Yes, I'm claiming we should lie to the American public ha.",

   "The US government makes 2 Trillion one year and spends 3 trillion. The next year it makes 2 trillion and spends 4 trillion. So forth and so on. You look at it like we are taking out one mortgage one time but in reality we are taking out higher loans each year in a Madoff type Ponzi scheme. So right now we making $2 trillion a year with a $11 trillion loan that is ever increasing. The people you read this from might be the ones that thought interest only loans were a good idea.\n\n What I am looking at is the plot that I referenced of the historic debt per GDP - which I am linking again here: U.S. National Debt Graph: Since Great Depression . This shows that we are not constantly increasing debt per GDP. In the 50s-70s and 90s, it went down. It had even stabilized prior to the recent economic crisis. Can you please comment on this graph instead of ignoring it. Do you disagree with its validity? If not, then how can you conclude that we are constantly added a 2008 style debt each year?\n \nEating these words now? Haha, I had to :). As you might have noticed we have Warren Buffet, a person who advises Obama among other things, has called for a second stimulus package.\n\n I had hoped that we would need no second stimulus package and it is still unclear that we need one - given that the Obama stimulus hasn't really kicked in much yet (not much of it spent). That is still a question. However, my point remains valid - any such stimulus is temporary in order to get the economy turned around. Once we are stabilized, then it would be very hard to argue for any new stimulus and, indeed, the Democrats would partly lose my support and the support of many moderates. We are not at that point. You, on the other hand, are arguing an unsupported position that the type of large borrowing we are doing short term is planned for long term - i.e. that we plan significantly increase our debt per GDP each year. Given the history, your claim has no support.\n \nOur debt wasn't a big deal until the 90s. Furthermore, it wasn't even that big during the 50s and 70s so paying it off was easy with our massive production during that time. \n\n Our debt was MUCH larger compared to GDP around WWII. Also, in the 90s, we started reducing debt as a percentage of GDP.\n \nIf this is the Bush package kicking in than brace yourself for the Obama stimulus package. If $168 billion buys you 9.5% unemployment than what will $800 billion do! \n\n Am I reading this correctly? Are you actually saying that a GREATER stimulus package will lead to MORE unemployment? emoticon_xdonno\n \nMy point is Obama claimed one thing about the stimulus package and frankly he failed. It called for unemployment to start leveling off back in early May under 8.% and now we are at 9.5% and still climbing. What makes you think he will be right starting now? Furthermore, do you understand the cost to comply with the stimulus bill? This is where the job creation is going to be. I work with universities a lot and they are hiring consultants for months just to understand the reporting requirements. It is costing taxpayers millions just to comply with the law. \n \n Also, you claim it is hard to judge how bad things would have been but who is to say it would have been worse or better? This kind of fallacy is often used by Obama and others. \n \n\n Without the Bush and Obama stimulus packages, the unemployment would have been worse since there was a high risk of bank collapse. Of course, it is hard to prove a \"what could have been\" but it strikes me as very significant that an administration that is so ideologically driven (the Bush administration) in, among other things, opposing such government stimulii would be convinced that it was necessary. The threat of not introducing the Bush stimulus plan certainly seems from this alone to have been very great. Indeed, I heard a universal outcry of dire predictions at the beginning of this economic crisis that has very largely died down after all of these stimulus packages came through - both here and abroad.\n \nIt isn't my rhetoric. That is the GAO...not exactly a biased agency. Furthermore, economists aren't the ones to judge these things. It is an appeal to authority fallacy because the \"authority\" you cite has no real authority on the matter. Economists are not accountants and for good reason. Furthermore, I'd like to see just what economists you see that say the debt is no big deal. \n\n There is a huge difference between saying that debt is \"no big deal\" and saying that our economy will tank. You are arguing extremes. In between, there is the arguement that I make and, to my understanding, the Administration makes that debt is a problem but one that is still sustainable and necessary, given our current economic crisis.\n \nFinally, just look at it from a common sense point of view. If you personally increase your debt every year and use more debt to pay the old debt than do you think you will declare bankruptcy in your lifetime? Why do you feel the federal government is any different? How are we different than the Romans?\n\n If I increase debt every year in a sustainable way, periodically pay some of it off and, meanwhile, continue servicing the debt (by paying the interest payments plus some principal), then I will not go bankrupt and could do quite well. That is what the US is doing. I agree that our debt is getting more uncomfortable than it used to be but it is still sustainable. I agree that, if we borrow as much each year as we did this year, then we would be in trouble, but that is not what is planned.\n \n ---on edit----\n You refered to the GAO and its prediction of our long-term unsustainable debt. However, you failed to mention that their predictions of unsustainable debt were mainly based on predictions that our health care and social security costs will rise unsustainably **if policy actions are not taken**. Here is a quote from their web site: U.S. GAO - The Nation's Long-Term Fiscal Outlook: March 2009 Update\n \nThe Nation's Long-Term Fiscal Outlook: March 2009 Update\n GAO-09-405SP April 30, 2009\n Full Report (PDF, 15 pages) Accessible Text\n \n Summary\n The new President, the new Congress, and the American people have been understandably focused on addressing problems with financial markets and responding to the economic downturn. However, the nation will need to apply the same level of intensity to the nation's long-term fiscal challenge. As shown in the figure below and the attached charts, GAO's updated simulations continue to show escalating and persistent debt that illustrates the long-term fiscal outlook is unsustainable. By 2025, debt held by the public under the Alternative simulation exceeds the historical high reached in the aftermath of World War II.\n \n GAO's updated simulations reflect the effects of policies undertaken to stabilize the financial markets and stimulate the economy through mid- March 2009. According to CBO's March 2009 estimates, the actions taken to date and the weakened economy will produce a surge in debt held by the public in fiscal year 2009. While the factors driving the near-term outlook can be and have been quite volatile, the long-term fundamentals have not changed. Health care costs are still growing faster than the economy and the nation's population continues to age. GAO's long-term simulations show that absent policy actions aimed at reforming the key drivers of our structural deficits-- health spending and Social Security--the federal government faces unsustainable growth in debt. The longer that action to deal with the federal government's long-term fiscal outlook is delayed, the greater the risk that the eventual changes will be disruptive and destabilizing.\n\n So, it is largely the expected health and social security future spending that has the GAO worried, not nearly as much the short term added debt. Indeed, we should all worry about such future spending on health and social security and finding a way to reduce their costs.",

Can you please comment on this graph instead of ignoring it. Do you disagree with its validity? If not, then how can you conclude that we are constantly added a 2008 style debt each year?\nI did not mean to ignore it and perhaps I wasn't clear in addressing it earlier. I think the graph is irrelevant because government debt to GDP is not a figure that means anything in terms of government financial stability. The multiplier effect of government spending manipulates this number. In an overly simple example if you tax $0 and borrow $100 and your multiplier effect is 3 than you get $300 increase in GDP plus the $100 government spent for GDP of $400 with a debt ratio of only 25%. Now is that countries government in good or bad shape? The answer is bad shape.\n \n \nI had hoped that we would need no second stimulus package and it is still unclear that we need one - given that the Obama stimulus hasn't really kicked in much yet (not much of it spent).

You, on the other hand, are arguing an unsupported position that the type of large borrowing we are doing short term is planned for long term - i.e. that we plan significantly increase our debt per GDP each year. Given the history, your claim has no support.\nNo, I don't care about % of GDP because it makes no sense to use (I admit it is not a totally worthless number but not the best one to look at). Your point I was addressing was that no one is calling for a 2nd stimulus and that is not true. We are seeing signs of it now. \n \n And yes, not much of the stimulus has kicked in because it is phased in over a few years making it impossible to know if a recovery is caused by the stimulus or natural means. There are numerous indications in China that the stimulus they did (much smaller) actually stalled a lot of growth and hurt some industries while the growth and demand for cheap goods brought them out. \n \n The type of borrowing is planned for the long term. The 10 year plan shows nothing but debt above anything Bush did. Now if you are fixated on the debt to GDP graph you will notice it went up under Bush...what makes you think the increased debt with Obama will result in something different? http://www.factcheck.org/demos/factcheck/imagefiles/image/2009/3_25_Obama_Prime_Time_Pitch/CBO_Obama_budget_deficit_estimates_march(1).jpg\n \n\n Am I reading this correctly? Are you actually saying that a GREATER stimulus package will lead to MORE unemployment? emoticon_xdonno\nNo, that was a failed attempt at a little light humor. What I am getting at is that stimulus doesn't relate to unemployment. In fact, we might not have seen the worst. Many states, for example, assumed they would get stimulus money and thus used that to plug the hole for the previous fiscal year before they actually got the money...like a bridge loan kinda thing. So now when the get the money it really isn't there to spend so we take the hit this year. One of the many problems you don't hear about but I do as an auditor :).\n \n \nWithout the Bush and Obama stimulus packages, the unemployment would have been worse since there was a high risk of bank collapse. Of course, it is hard to prove a \"what could have been\" but it strikes me as very significant that an administration that is so ideologically driven (the Bush administration) in, among other things, opposing such government stimulii would be convinced that it was necessary. The threat of not introducing the Bush stimulus plan certainly seems from this alone to have been very great. Indeed, I heard a universal outcry of dire predictions at the beginning of this economic crisis that has very largely died down after all of these stimulus packages came through - both here and abroad.\n \nI don't see a difference in the two so it isn't significant to me. Furthermore, there is nothing to prove it would have been worse. In fact, we already beat the \"if we don't do it\" number which was under the current 9.5%. They were wrong with their predictions on the immediate outcome and I wasn't.\n \n \nThere is a huge difference between saying that debt is \"no big deal\" and saying that our economy will tank. You are arguing extremes. In between, there is the arguement that I make and, to my understanding, the Administration makes that debt is a problem but one that is still sustainable and necessary, given our current economic crisis.\nFor ten years? I don't take an administration seriously that says the debt is a problem but we are going to have deficits greater than the previous president each year.\n \n \nIf I increase debt every year in a sustainable way, periodically pay some of it off and, meanwhile, continue servicing the debt (by paying the interest payments plus some principal), then I will not go bankrupt and could do quite well. That is what the US is doing. I agree that our debt is getting more uncomfortable than it used to be but it is still sustainable. I agree that, if we borrow as much each year as we did this year, then we would be in trouble, but that is not what is planned.\nIf your debt increases every year you are not paying some of it off. Well, we actually pay all of it off and just issue new debt. Do you realize interest on debt is one of the top 5 expenditures of the US? More than the budget of DOE. \n \n \nYou refered to the GAO and its prediction of our long-term unsustainable debt. However, you failed to mention that their predictions of unsustainable debt were mainly based on predictions that our health care and social security costs will rise unsustainably **if policy actions are not taken**.

Indeed, we should all worry about such future spending on health and social security and finding a way to reduce their costs.\nWhat do you think causes the debt? Social Security, Medicare, and other social services are the biggest costs other than defense that alone consume the vast majority of the revenue. I don't see how this changes anything. And no, it isn't from the fiscal outlook, it is from our financial statements. Trust me, I talk to the GAO folks all the time...it's a problem. There is no confusion on what they mean. David Walker now works for a NPO that talks about the debt we currently have and how we are on a bad road.",

If the oil companies sell 100 billion gallons of gas at $2 a gallon at 10% profit margin, that makes a $20 billion profit. If they sell the same 100 billion gallons of gas at $4 a gallon at the same 10% profit margin, then that makes a $40 billion profit for no extra work. If they sold 200 billion gallons of gas at $2 a gallon instead of 100 billion gallons at $4 a gallon to make that same profit, I would not complain. I am complaining since that profit was gained with no extra added value. Would you tolerate a similar situation if the insurance industry would suddenly increase its rates by a factor of two which means that, keeping the same profit margin, their profit would increase by a factor of two despite no added value or cost on their part of the policy? \n \n If either gas or insurance (or pharmaceuticals) were products that people could live without then I wouldn't have as much of an objection since the prices could be self-limiting due to decreased demand. That is why I don't complain about any high profits made by companies that sell goods that people can live without since their prices do not form a stranglehold on consumers - they can simply choose not to buy. That is not the case with products such as gas, drugs, insurance, food, etc.",

Seems unamerican. \n\n You have apparently been completely ignoring my posts where I state that my criticism is limited to companies who sell products that Americans cannot do without - ex. health insurance, drugs, oil, food - and am fine with high profits for products that Americans can have a genuine choice in buying. I believe in the very American concept of keeping a market streamlined through competition. When there is a monopoly of any sort, then Americans lose out. Right now, we are far too dependent on oil for our energy. If we had genuine choices of energy sources - ex. we could choose to run our cars on either gas or energy derived from alternate choices - then there would be genuine competition that would keep prices at reasonable levels. That competition currently does not exist. The combination of a product that Americans cannot do without (at least not without MAJOR government investment in public transportation infrastructure) and an essential monopoly of that product (in that other sources of energy are still currently underdeveloped) leads to an unhealthy market through lack of the positive effects of competition.\n \n Would you do the same for a small company that doubled their prices for no more effort to them even if it came the same profit margin? \n\n Only if the small company had a stranglehold on a product that was needed. For example, if that small company was the only one supplying electricity to a town I lived in. \n \nGuess this answers the above question but I don't see oil as something people can't live without.

An even bigger problem with taxing as a solution is now the government is relying on that extra tax money. If exxon stops making a profit the government will still want that money somehow. \n\n Credit card companies only make money when people behave badly - i.e. they live beyond their means. Living beyond your means is a luxury so I don't mind them making profits off of such luxuries. As for food, I never complained about food prices. I only added food as an example of one of the necessities in life. Car insurance is a necessity for car owners but, as you said, competition has kept prices down - unlike gas, there is not an limited supply of potential insurers. \n \n I don't know how you can say that Americans don't need oil. The only way they would not need oil is if they all moved back to cities and used public transportation - at least that would be the only way of significantly decreasing the public need for oil. Otherwise, there would have to be MASSIVE government investment in public transportation infrastructure to get most Americans using public transportation in their current state of residency - i.e. such a large percentage living in suburbia. Even in the hypothetical case of them all moving back to cities, you would still need that massive investment in new public transportation to accomodate them. I have no doubt that that massive investment will not happen. So, Americans need gas just to get to work and live. Gas is a necessity, not a luxury, and should be treated as such.",

   "I did not mean to ignore it and perhaps I wasn't clear in addressing it earlier. I think the graph is irrelevant because government debt to GDP is not a figure that means anything in terms of government financial stability. The multiplier effect of government spending manipulates this number. In an overly simple example if you tax $0 and borrow $100 and your multiplier effect is 3 than you get $300 increase in GDP plus the $100 government spent for GDP of $400 with a debt ratio of only 25%. Now is that countries government in good or bad shape? The answer is bad shape.\n\n Your example is so exaggerated as to be irrelevant. GDP only changes a few percent a year and, apart from this last pair of stimulus packages, I have read that we tax three times more than we borrow. GDP grows for a number of reasons - including a growing population, growing efficiency through new technologies, etc. Compared to the WWII era, we have a far larger population and more productivity per worker. So you cannot look at the gross figure of WWII debt (even using 2009 dollars) to compare since that would be divided over a much smaller population (and one that was less productive per worker). For more local comparisons (ex. 2009 to 2001), then the GDP, population and productivity per worker wouldn't have changed nearly as much so I have less probrem using a direct debt comparison.\n \nYour point I was addressing was that no one is calling for a 2nd stimulus and that is not true. We are seeing signs of it now.\n \n When I wrote the post, the new talk of stimuli was not in the mainstream. It did occur afterwards but that still does not negate my main point that the stimuli were meant to be a temporary measure to try to fix the economy. You seemed to be saying that we plan to take on that much debt every year - or am I wrong in interpreting your view that way? Please answer this question.\n \nAnd yes, not much of the stimulus has kicked in because it is phased in over a few years making it impossible to know if a recovery is caused by the stimulus or natural means. There are numerous indications in China that the stimulus they did (much smaller) actually stalled a lot of growth and hurt some industries while the growth and demand for cheap goods brought them out. \n\n My understanding was that China's stimulus was larger compared to their GDP than ours, though perhaps of a different type. Also, could you point out a link that brings out the indications that you mention? Here is a web site from businessweek that refutes your claim that China's stimulus is not working: China's Stimulus Package Boosts Economy - BusinessWeek :\n \nAcross China, steelmakers, cement producers, and construction companies are seeing sales soar as Beijing's stimulus plan opens the spigot on funding for railways, airports, and power plants. The economic surge isn't just about earth-moving. The Shanghai stock market is up 35% so far this year, one of the fastest-growing bourses in the world. The long slumbering property market is showing signs of a revival, with sales volume growing 29% in seven of China's biggest cities including Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing in the first two months, says Jing Ulrich, managing director of China equities at JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in Hong Kong, though prices have not yet recovered. And in March auto sales grew 27.2%, following a cut in taxes on smaller vehicles that took effect on Jan. 20 and helping first-quarter sales grow a respectable 3.9%. \n \n While first-quarter gross domestic product grew 6.1%, the lowest in almost a decade, many analysts are now turning more bullish on China's economy. On Apr. 22, Goldman Sachs (GS) said it expects Chinese GDP growth to hit 8.3% this year, compared with an earlier forecast of 6%. Other banks have become more optimistic, too. Citing what she called \"very strong stimulus-related bank-lending growth,\" Tao Wang, head of China economic research at UBS (UBS), last week upgraded the bank's 2009 GDP growth forecast to 7.5%, from its earlier forecast of 6.5%. \"While the external outlook remains bleak, there have been signs of domestic activity picking up in China, as a result of the government's policy stimulus,\" she wrote. \n \n Beijing's leaders are patting themselves on the back for moving fast to prime the pump. Speaking at a conference over the weekend, Li Rongrong, head of the watchdog organization for China's largest state-owned enterprises, said earnings at those companies grew 26% in March compared with the same period a year ago. In a speech on Apr. 18 at the same conference, on the tropical island of Hainan, Premier Wen Jiabao said the government deserved credit for the good news. \"China's rapid reaction in rolling out the stimulus package has resolved some prominent problems in the economy, strengthened market confidence, and stabilized people's expectations,\" Wen said. \n\n So, the Chinese are quite sattisfied with the success of their stimulus package and are \"patting themselves on the back\" for their wise decision. That doesn't exactly square with your analysis.\n \nThe type of borrowing is planned for the long term. The 10 year plan shows nothing but debt above anything Bush did. Now if you are fixated on the debt to GDP graph you will notice it went up under Bush...what makes you think the increased debt with Obama will result in something different? http://www.factcheck.org/demos/factcheck/imagefiles/image/2009/3_25_Obama_Prime_Time_Pitch/CBO_Obama_budget_deficit_estimates_march(1).jpg\n\n There are at least three types of borrowing that we need to refer to:\n 1) The recent stimulus packages. We may differ in our views on whether or not they are necessary for economic recovery from this latest economic crisis. Either way, the very GAO that you respect does not point to these as the culprit for long-term unsustainable growth in borrowing. Indeed, if you look at the plots in the pdf version of the summary I linked, then the GREAT majority of the coming debt that the US will have to pay (that they are almost exclusively worried about) is the debt that will be added by the second point...\n \n 2) Future debt from underfunded entitlements. This is something that I think we all need to worry about since this potential debt dwarfs all other debts if it is not resolved through policy changes. The types of policy changes needed may be a topic for another thread but anyone worried about debt has to look at underfunded health and social security entitlements as, by far, the largest concern - at least according to the GAO.\n \n 3) Un-necessary debt. Granted, this is a vague term, but I am referring to debt when we as a country live beyond our means - ex. go through with un-necessary wars, waste money on ineffective social programs, etc. This often comes down to political differences about what one considers necessary spending - Republicans beating down on social programs, Democrats beating down on un-necessarily high military spending, etc. Either way, for the sake of the country, both parties have to find some compromise in this.\n \n The reason I list these is that the Republicans are almost exclusively pointing to the recent stimulus packages as being the doom-makers of our economy whereas the other two are far more important and they existed prior to this economic crisis - while the Republicans were silent on debt. That is another indication to me that the current outcry by Republicans is largely politics driven - not driven by fundamentals.\n \nI don't see a difference in the two so it isn't significant to me. Furthermore, there is nothing to prove it would have been worse. In fact, we already beat the \"if we don't do it\" number which was under the current 9.5%. They were wrong with their predictions on the immediate outcome and I wasn't.\n\n I am not in the position of knowledge of economics to prove that it would have been worse but the fact that an administration that opposed such stimuli felt compelled to introduce a stimulus package, the fact that most industrialized countries introduced their own stimulus packages (including China which, from my link, is quite happy with themselves that they did so), and the fact that there was a unified cry from economists that stimulus was needed - all points out to me that, without a stimulus package, things could have been far worse. Just because the stimulus packages didn't work AS WELL as was hoped doesn't mean that they did not save us from an economy that would have been worse.\n \nFor ten years? I don't take an administration seriously that says the debt is a problem but we are going to have deficits greater than the previous president each year.\n \n If your debt increases every year you are not paying some of it off. Well, we actually pay all of it off and just issue new debt. Do you realize interest on debt is one of the top 5 expenditures of the US? More than the budget of DOE.\n\n It has been for decades now. Why am I only hearing cries from Republicans now? Why were Republicans largely silent (except for a few maverics) during the Bush administration when we faced the same debt problems?\n \n As I have said a few times now: I agree that debt is a problem. We just disagree about how much of a problem it is. Republicans are saying that the \"sky is falling\" because of these stimuli. That is false. The GAO is essentially saying that the sky will fall (i.e. debt will be unsustainable) not because of any stimulus (which their summary called understandable) but because of the skyrocketing health and social security costs. Let's keep our eye on the actual ball - those underfunded entitlements.\n \nWhat do you think causes the debt? Social Security, Medicare, and other social services are the biggest costs other than defense that alone consume the vast majority of the revenue. I don't see how this changes anything. And no, it isn't from the fiscal outlook, it is from our financial statements. Trust me, I talk to the GAO folks all the time...it's a problem. There is no confusion on what they mean. David Walker now works for a NPO that talks about the debt we currently have and how we are on a bad road.\n\n The thing that this changes is what we are concentrating on. I hope that we agree that we should concentrate on reducing costs of Social Security and Medicare. Instead, most Republicans are casting all blame on our current stimulus packages. Lets keep our eye on the real ball....",

   "It isn't exaggerated. The point is to show that debt as a percentage of GDP is not a relevant figure. It doesn't tell you anything about whether or not our debt is a problem and how big of a problem.\n\n I noticed that you did not comment on the comparison to our debt in WWII. Can you honestly say that a debt of X amount of dollars (in 2009 dollars) around the WWII time period would be the same as that same X amount of dollar debt now? There were far fewer people in the US around WWII so that debt would have been divided among far fewer people (much higher per capita debt). Also, productivity was lower per worker so an average worker would have to work longer to pay off the same potential per capita debt. (For productivity comparisons, imagine how productive you would be as an accountant if you had to work using only manual calculations on paper - no computers.) When making comparisons on such a wide range of historical conditions, it is unreasonable not to take these huge differences into account. Quoting debt per GDP takes these differences into account quite well.\n \n This doesn't matter...the point is we are taking on more debt than the previous presidents each year.\n\n Lets look at the very plot that you referenced : http://www.factcheck.org/demos/factcheck/imagefiles/image/2009/3_25_Obama_Prime_Time_Pitch/CBO_Obama_budget_deficit_estimates_march(1).jpg . By your own plot, deficits reduce by a factor of three by 2013 and then start rising. Your own plot shows that deficits do not increase every year. That projected rise from 2013 is mainly due to projected increases in entitlement costs. Around 2012, we will no longer have a theoretical surplus in Social Security (which would have been real if we had not continually borrowed from its coffers) so that Social Security costs will need to start digging into some of the previous surpluses (meaning cashing in on those Government Securities- i.e. getting back some of the money that was taken/borrowed from that fund). \n \nHow does percentage of GDP mean anything here? It was significantly less than the combined US stimulus packages. Furthermore, if it worked than wouldn't you think it would be working here.\n\n China's stimulus package was 8% of their GDP or just under $600 billion (from Asian Markets Spike On China Stimulus Package : NPR ) and, from what I understand, it was implemented much faster. Our implemented stimulus packages are much less compared to GDP. Of course you have to compare to GDP since giving X amount of stimulus dollars to a smaller economy does more good than giving that same stimulus dollars to a larger economy. As an extreme comparison, Luxembourg would find themselves absolutely rolling in money for decades to come if they got an influx of money equal to the US stimulus package.\n \nI read that Businessweek article which was also shown on Bloomberg. Basically they just claim it was this but provide no evidence to support it. Like a hypocrite I actually don't have time to dig up the evidence but basically when I looked at the numbers China, while still having a down year in exports, is benefiting from an increase in demand of their cheap goods which in turns gives the citizens more money and so forth and so on. The stimulus related more to raw metals and that didn't really help much because we still see bad export numbers...even when the have increased a bit. \n \n Ask me later and I can get some more detail on this.\n\n We can leave this issue unresolved until you do send out those details.\n \nI don't see it as the culprit either. The GAO warns that our current path is unsustainable so it isn't just our current debt but our future obligations that kill us. The GAO understands that we keep increasing our debt every year...no one year is to blame but they all contribute.\n\n Yes, they all contribute, but by far the largest contributing factor - and the factor that tips the scales to unsustainability - is future debt accrued due to the entitlements. Just look at their projected deficit plots (from that link that I showed from the GAO). It is clear that if we solved our entitlement problem now (ex. cut benefits, increased taxes, cut healthcare costs, increase retirement age, etc.), then that projected debt would be miniscule in comparison and our debt would be sustainable. Remember, they are saying that WITHOUT POLICY CHANGES our debt will BECOME unsustainable. That is a call to action on their part to convince us to make those policy changes. I may occasionally be cynical, but I don't think that we are THAT stupid as a nation as to not make any policy changes - especially once those new entitlement debts start being obvious. We still have a very good chance of sustainability if we do bite the political bullet and make those necessary changes.\n \nBecause it is the biggest percentage of our budget. The stimulus spent a lot of money on these things (not ss).\n\n But if health and social security stayed at the same percentage of GDP as it is now, then our debt would be sustainable. Again, the GAO claims that our debt would be unsustainable **if we made no or insufficient policy changes to reduce health and social security costs**. It is a major problem because of what it is expected to BECOME, not for what it currently IS.\n \nYou give these examples of debt but who cares. Debt is debt. It isn't like it is debt for one year and next year will be in the black and just pay it off.\n\n There is a difference between borrowing $1 trillion and borrowing $50 trillion dollars. If the $1 trillion debt is needed (to avoid a Depression) and the $50 trillion potential debt is something we can avoid through painful policy choices (of reducing social security and health costs), then it is clear which one we have to concentrate on. \n \nBecause they are politicians. I'm not arguing for republicans...I was whining about the deficit prior to Obama.\n \n Back when bush was here they said the path we are on is unsustainable. The stimulus passes and all these bailouts only keep us on that unsustainable path. More debt is not the answer to a problem of debt. The GAO says it is a problem now. Don't manipulate what they say.\n \n It is debt that is the problem, not ss or medicare. Those just happen to be the biggest expenditures now and in the future. The GAO actually talks about what they want to do...most of it involves cutting defense, reform medicare and ss, and balancing the budget. \n\n I think we both agree on reducing future entitlement debt and on trying to keep within the budget and reduce deficits when they aren't necessary. Mostly, we disagree on the question of whether deficit spending is ever necessary. I continue to believe that the current added deficit due to stimulus programs was necessary to avoid a far worse economy. I know you disagree. Perhaps, then, we could agree to disagree about the stimulus and concentrate on the two types of borrowing that we both agree is a problem - i.e. future debt due to entitlement cost growth, and deficits during times when we are not in recession.",

   "I wrote an entire response and it didn't post...very frustrating. This post won't be as extensive because I hate retyping.\n \n \nI noticed that you did not comment on the comparison to our debt in WWII. Can you honestly say that a debt of X amount of dollars (in 2009 dollars) around the WWII time period would be the same as that same X amount of dollar debt now? \nPer capita debt after inflation is more now than it was in WWII\n \n \nLets look at the very plot that you referenced : http://www.factcheck.org/demos/factcheck/imagefiles/image/2009/3_25_Obama_Prime_Time_Pitch/CBO_Obama_budget_deficit_estimates_march(1).jpg . By your own plot, deficits reduce by a factor of three by 2013 and then start rising. Your own plot shows that deficits do not increase every year. That projected rise from 2013 is mainly due to projected increases in entitlement costs. Around 2012, we will no longer have a theoretical surplus in Social Security (which would have been real if we had not continually borrowed from its coffers) so that Social Security costs will need to start digging into some of the previous surpluses (meaning cashing in on those Government Securities- i.e. getting back some of the money that was taken/borrowed from that fund). \nThat is debt every year that is more than every previous president per year (assuming I go by president at year end date). \n \n \nWe can leave this issue unresolved until you do send out those details.\nThis takes awhile since I'm going to actual data and not news articles. I don't have a few hours to do this but perhaps this week. :)\n \n \nYes, they all contribute, but by far the largest contributing factor - and the factor that tips the scales to unsustainability - is future debt accrued due to the entitlements. Just look at their projected deficit plots (from that link that I showed from the GAO). It is clear that if we solved our entitlement problem now (ex. cut benefits, increased taxes, cut healthcare costs, increase retirement age, etc.), then that projected debt would be miniscule in comparison and our debt would be sustainable. Remember, they are saying that WITHOUT POLICY CHANGES our debt will BECOME unsustainable. That is a call to action on their part to convince us to make those policy changes. I may occasionally be cynical, but I don't think that we are THAT stupid as a nation as to not make any policy changes - especially once those new entitlement debts start being obvious. We still have a very good chance of sustainability if we do bite the political bullet and make those necessary changes.\n \n But if health and social security stayed at the same percentage of GDP as it is now, then our debt would be sustainable. Again, the GAO claims that our debt would be unsustainable **if we made no or insufficient policy changes to reduce health and social security costs**. It is a major problem because of what it is expected to BECOME, not for what it currently IS.\nI'll address this as a whole. HHS and SS take up about 60% of our revenue. Once you add in defense and interest on debt you are out of money. This is why these are a problem. They will consume so much of the budget that it makes us unsustainable. The GAO says this is a problem now...not for the future. You can't claim that our current debt isn't a problem if do something about those two programs. Why? Because this is obvious. The GAO states if we don't fix it now we will have to fix it by cutting benefits..probably in half...and increasing taxes by 60% in under 30 years. That 60% is after inflation by the way. \n \n If you eat poorly than eventually this will be \"unsustainable\" and you will have heart disease. That doesn't mean eating poorly isn't currently a problem. If you stop now the punishment is only a few hours a day on the treadmill...later it becomes a major surgery. \n \n Now, the problem the GAO doesn't address...and is not tasked to...is that people take concern now. China has already stated they want another currency. No one would do this unless our currency is expected to devalue. That happens when you print too much money. You can pay for debt by printing or borrowing. We print a lot and countries don't want to borrow increasing amounts each year because you can't do that forever. \n \n Also, not paying out medicare and social security is basically a default on a loan which could hurt the US. This can cause more problems in the future because the obligation becomes larger.\n \n So to tie it all together, when you have a president who decides to up our deficit EVEN MORE per year than previous presidents you pretty much speed up the problem. I believe the GAO projections assumed a fairly steady deficit for 30 years of -$200 billion or so. Obama doesn't want to go below $600 billion. So far the GAO hasn't come up with updated predictions but I'd suspect we are going to be unsustainable sooner than later. \n \n By the way, future obligations really are a liability. If you look at a financial statements they include things you will HAVE to pay in the future. So that is why it is said we are unsustainable at the present. It is wrong to say this debt is \"future\" just like it is wrong to say your mortgage is \"future debt\". \n \n \nThere is a difference between borrowing $1 trillion and borrowing $50 trillion dollars. If the $1 trillion debt is needed (to avoid a Depression) and the $50 trillion potential debt is something we can avoid through painful policy choices (of reducing social security and health costs), then it is clear which one we have to concentrate on. \nBoth, if $1 trillion does nothing more than make the $50 trillion problem a $51 trillion problem than you are better off fixing both. \n \n \nI think we both agree on reducing future entitlement debt and on trying to keep within the budget and reduce deficits when they aren't necessary. Mostly, we disagree on the question of whether deficit spending is ever necessary. I continue to believe that the current added deficit due to stimulus programs was necessary to avoid a far worse economy. I know you disagree. Perhaps, then, we could agree to disagree about the stimulus and concentrate on the two types of borrowing that we both agree is a problem - i.e. future debt due to entitlement cost growth, and deficits during times when we are not in recession.\nDoes Obama think we will be in recession until 2019 then? We have had a deficit every year since Reagan...if not more (I think it might be since 195x). This trend continues with Obama. If we practices fiscal responsibility now than future obligations wouldn't be an issue...obviously. \n \n So in short, the current debt is a problem because 1)we are paying for things that will soon become to large to even get debt to pay for 2)Increasing debt now increases the speed of it being a problem we can't fix 3)current debt puts you at risk when people stop buying it and you rely on it. There are already signs of this. \n \n In the end it works just like your personal bank account works. You can't increase debt forever.",

   "I do not ask the government to take care of roadways but that does not mean that I do not benefit from such actions, so I should pay taxes to support it. Exxon certainly benefits from government actions which help stabilize the supply of the product it sells so it should pay for that benefit.\nNo choice in paying taxes :) And I'm not so sure it even benefits them nor does it hurt them. \n \n \nYou have apparently been completely ignoring my posts where I state that my criticism is limited to companies who sell products that Americans cannot do without - ex. health insurance, drugs, oil, food - and am fine with high profits for products that Americans can have a genuine choice in buying. I believe in the very American concept of keeping a market streamlined through competition. When there is a monopoly of any sort, then Americans lose out. Right now, we are far too dependent on oil for our energy. If we had genuine choices of energy sources - ex. we could choose to run our cars on either gas or energy derived from alternate choices - then there would be genuine competition that would keep prices at reasonable levels. That competition currently does not exist.\nIt doesn't exist because people don't want it. Oil is much much cheaper than anything else. It is a myth that oil is a monopoly of life. Still, oil competes with coal, natural gas, ethanol, and other natural resources. This may be the only source for cars but the price isn't high enough for people to switch to something else. The free market system does work here too. In fact, we saw it with oil going back down after people stopped buying it.

However, they benefited significantly for it so instead of giving them the usual tax breaks that I hear they get, we should tax them on the windfall profits - profits that they got on a windfall for no extra work. If somebody wins the lottery, we also tax them exceptionally high. Besides, there still remains the fact that we taxpayers pay for wars and policies that we would not get into if not for protecting the oil supply - these costs are in the trillions. In pure capitalism, the companies selling oil would carry all the costs of making sure that one can get that oil.\n \n As for alternative fuels, people buy what is cheapest which is currently gas. The other technologies were not sufficiently developed. No matter what the reasons, that means that gas is currently an essential product for anyone needing private transportation which, without massive government investment in public transportation, means the great majority of Americans NEED gas to live and to work. Do you imagine that 150 million working Americans can suddenly decide not to use gas for transportation? How exactly do you think that change would work?",

   "I wrote an entire response and it didn't post...very frustrating. This post won't be as extensive because I hate retyping.\n\n That's happened to me before - very frustrating. To remedy that, I occasionally copy all the typed text into buffer so, if 4forums.com creates a problem, I still have that text in memory.\n \nPer capita debt after inflation is more now than it was in WWII\n\n Tha makes up for much of the difference but there is another important difference in historical conditions that per capita debt does not take into account - namely productivity. Imagine if you had to pay off $10,000 worth of debt and that you were paid a fixed amount by your clients for each type of calculation as an accountant (be it that all tax analysis would pay the same, etc.). It would take far longer for you to pay off that $10,000 debt if you had to pay it off by making those calculations in long-hand on paper than if you were to pay it off by making the calculation via computer programs - simply because you could do a lot more calculations and thereby get a lot more charged transactions by using a computer than by making calculations by hand. That is the difference in productivity and it makes a very significant difference in the amount of average debt that Americans can carry. The GDP calculation effectively takes both population and worker productivity differences into account. It may have its flaws in that, during Stimulus times, there is some enhancement due to that stimulus, but, when looking long term, the benefits of comparing debt per GDP far outweigh the limitations. For short term comparisons, then it is more of a toss up.\n \nI'll address this as a whole. HHS and SS take up about 60% of our revenue. Once you add in defense and interest on debt you are out of money. This is why these are a problem. They will consume so much of the budget that it makes us unsustainable.

If you stop now the punishment is only a few hours a day on the treadmill...later it becomes a major surgery. \n\n I think that you are misinterpreting what I mean by Social Security and Medicare not being an unsustainable problem now. I mean that, if we keep costs as they currently stand - i.e. if we made policy changes to keep them at the same percent of GDP as they are now - then our debt would be sustainable. The main arguement of the GAO is that Social Security and Medicare costs are a problem because they are expected to GROW. My point is that, if we make the appropriate painful policy changes to keep them from growing, then our debt as it is now would still be sustainable. \n \nNow, the problem the GAO doesn't address...and is not tasked to...is that people take concern now.

My understanding is that most of the Stimulus is being paid for through borrowing (from abroad, from the SS trust fund, from new bonds, etc.). Do you have sources (i.e. links) that say otherwise?\n \nAlso, not paying out medicare and social security is basically a default on a loan which could hurt the US. This can cause more problems in the future because the obligation becomes larger.\n\n Can you elaborate? What do you mean by \"not paying out medicare and social security?\" Do you mean not paying the benefits to people or do you mean the taking of the current (but soon to disappear) social security surplus? It is not clear.\n \nSo to tie it all together, when you have a president who decides to up our deficit EVEN MORE per year than previous presidents you pretty much speed up the problem. I believe the GAO projections assumed a fairly steady deficit for 30 years of -$200 billion or so. Obama doesn't want to go below $600 billion. So far the GAO hasn't come up with updated predictions but I'd suspect we are going to be unsustainable sooner than later. \n\n The latest prediction from the GAO was in April 2009, as shown by my previous link. If you look at the plots shown in the link then you see that the deficits quickly rise above $1 trillion due to Social Security and Medicare growth projections. Also, the plot that you previously showed had our deficits reducing quickly from $1.8 trillion to ~$600 billion in a couple of years. The further rise after 2013 coincides perfectly with the rise of costs of Social Security and Medicare when there is no longer a surplus to use up. The bottom line is that all of the predictions of unsustainability lie in the threat posed if Social Security and Medicare GROWTH is not controlled. That is what we need to concentrate on.\n \nBy the way, future obligations really are a liability. If you look at a financial statements they include things you will HAVE to pay in the future. So that is why it is said we are unsustainable at the present. It is wrong to say this debt is \"future\" just like it is wrong to say your mortgage is \"future debt\". \n\n That is only true if you don't change the circumstances that lead to that future debt. For example, we could increase the retirement age, decrease benefits (or let them grow at rates lower than inflation), increase Social Security and Medicare taxes or extend their cutoff to higher incomes, reduce health costs (we pay far more per person for our health than most industrialized countries), etc. Such painful changes would significantly decrease that future debt. That is why the GAO message is not one of unavoidable doom. It is a strong warning to us that we have to take policy action on what they called the \"key drivers of our structural deficits-- health spending and Social Security\" if we want to avoid that doom.\n \nBoth, if $1 trillion does nothing more than make the $50 trillion problem a $51 trillion problem than you are better off fixing both. \n\n Of course, every bit of stimulus adds to the potential debt but some added debt is necessary to save us during Recessions (I know you disagree). We just have to minimize the rest and work to occasionally pay the total debt down when we can (during boom periods).\n \nDoes Obama think we will be in recession until 2019 then? We have had a deficit every year since Reagan...if not more (I think it might be since 195x). This trend continues with Obama. If we practices fiscal responsibility now than future obligations wouldn't be an issue...obviously.\n\n I know you disagree, but, if we had made no stimulus packages, then our economy could well have fallen much farther - at least that was the general consensus that we were hearing at the end of 2008. A tanking economy certainly would not have helped us with our debt problem. \n \nSo in short, the current debt is a problem because 1)we are paying for things that will soon become to large to even get debt to pay for 2)Increasing debt now increases the speed of it being a problem we can't fix 3)current debt puts you at risk when people stop buying it and you rely on it.

It helped around WWII to get us out of the Great Depression. It helped for Reagan to get us out of the late 70s recession, etc. \n \n As for person finances, debt is occasionally necessary in personal finances. You just have to control the amount of debt: don't live beyond your means during normal times, make sure you pay much of the debt off in good times, and only borrow what is necessary during bad times.

What do you mean by \"not paying out medicare and social security?\" Do you mean not paying the benefits to people or do you mean the taking of the current (but soon to disappear) social security surplus?

The bottom line is that all of the predictions of unsustainability lie in the threat posed if Social Security and Medicare GROWTH is not controlled. That is what we need to concentrate on.\nThe GAO's March update is merely an update with some new information. The current FY ends in Sept. so and GAO uses much of the 2007 and 2008 data with debt assuming to grow a certain way as shown in the baseline. Social security and medicare growth are not controlled now...which is why they consume 60% of our revenue. \n \n I feel like you are missing a big point here. We already go into debt each and every year. With two ways to pay for that debt you put yourself at risk of either inflation or relying on other countries to fund you. They won't support you forever and China has already shown signs of wanting to pull out a little. \n \n \nThat is only true if you don't change the circumstances that lead to that future debt. For example, we could increase the retirement age, decrease benefits (or let them grow at rates lower than inflation), increase Social Security and Medicare taxes or extend their cutoff to higher incomes, reduce health costs (we pay far more per person for our health than most industrialized countries), etc. Such painful changes would significantly decrease that future debt.

It is a strong warning to us that we have to take policy action on what they called the \"key drivers of our structural deficits-- health spending and Social Security\" if we want to avoid that doom.\nAgain, I feel like you miss the point here. No one doubts entitlements are swelling the debt. Your point, I believe, is that the debt is not currently a huge problem. I'm saying it is because that future obligation is debt we currently have and adding things to it, like another entitlement program or a stimulus bill, only move up the unsustainable date assuming we can get there without having inflation or our creditors bail. Now, assuming we fix the problem today AND balance the budget we still have to pay down our 14 trillion debt. The fix basically admitted a default on most of our loans. The current debt of 14 trillion or so would take decades to pay down meaning raising taxes for less benefits to people....along with the no more social security and medicare. You see what I'm getting at? The longer you wait, the more you screw over the people who, at some point, have to pay it off. The stimulus is not free...that is money I pay back later at a much higher cost. \n \n We are left with few options here. \n \n \nOf course, every bit of stimulus adds to the potential debt but some added debt is necessary to save us during Recessions (I know you disagree). We just have to minimize the rest and work to occasionally pay the total debt down when we can (during boom periods).\nDoesn't seem to be working out and I had a meeting with the budget director for Virginia earlier this week and it doesn't look good. He was telling us that starting in 2011 when that stimulus money runs out they are budgeting a \"cliff effect\" where things go right down to what they would have assuming no stimulus money. This is a democrat who is buddy buddy with Tim Kaine who is buddy buddy with Obama. This is why you hear about a second stimulus. \n \n You may disagree but actions speak louder than words.\n \n \nI know you disagree, but, if we had made no stimulus packages, then our economy could well have fallen much farther - at least that was the general consensus that we were hearing at the end of 2008.

   "GDP doesn't work like this. The multiplier effect is really the reason you can't use GDP when looking at whether or not debt is a problem. \n\n Unless you are claiming that the multiplier effect is larger than the effect of large differences in population and productivity, then my point remains valid that dividing debt by GDP makes more sense in the balance. I can't see how you can deny that being true for long term comparisons. For short term comparisons, it might well be the opposite - that differences in the multiplier effect cause too much disturbance to that short term comparison.\n \nWell our debt now is caused my ss and HHS. I'm not sure your point? The new debt added on only makes our current situation unsustainable sooner.\n\n Social Security is still covered by Social Security taxes (at least until 2012 when the amount of money given out to retirees is more than the amount taken in through taxes). I'm not sure what the balance is right now of Medicare and the taxes we pay directly for it. The main problem has been that, instead of saving the surplus that we have had up to now, we have used it / borrowed it to live beyond our means in the rest of our expenses. If we were to leave Social Security and Medicare alone, including investing the surplus instead of spending it, then we would have been fine for much longer than 2012. \n \n Yes, it all comes from the same pool of money, but it wasn't supposed to. We were supposed to spend within our means for the rest of our expenses. Social security was supposed to pay for itself if we had let the surpluses play their actual part. \n \n Anyway, that is griping. My main point is that, if ss and HHS remained at the same rate of GDP as they are now, then, outside of the current stimulus packages, then with minor cuts in the other expenditures and/or increased taxes, we could be fine. There are two major problems - 1) We need to find ways of limiting costs and imbalances in SS and HHS, and 2) We need to live within our means outside of that. That means that, if we decide to go into an un-necessary war, we need to pay for that in taxes, not borrow money. If there is major expenditure associated with a national disaster such as Katrina and we don't have the funds, then we need to pay for that with taxes, not borrow. We need to trim the spending to what is needed and pay for that (which of course is interpreted differently by different parties). \n \n As for stimulus, we continue to disagree. Do you think that all industrialized countries, including China, were simply foolish for introducing their own stimulus packages? Do you think that the idiologically directed Bush administration that otherwise would have opposed stimulus packages suddenly lost all reason? I just don't see how you could see everyone else as being wrong.\n \nIt can be seen somewhat here: \n \n FRB: H.4.1 Release--Factors Affecting Reserve Balances--July 9, 2009\n\n Being a physicist, not an accountant, much of that is pretty criptic. I can't tell from that how many new bills were printed purely due to the stimulus package. New bills are printed all the time since old bills wear out and for other reasons. Again, I just need to find out how many new dollars were printed purely for the reason of the stimulus. Do you have such a less-criptic link?\n \nCutting benefits is the same as not paying because this is money you give to the government to hold until you need it later. That's the idea at least. If you can't pay up it is seen as a default and rightfully so.\n\n Most people I know don't think of it as a \"government holding onto your money until later\" system. We think of it as it actually is. We pay for retirees now so that we will be supported later. Even with that, most of my fellow Generation Xer friends are assuming that we will get NO social security benefits when we retire so getting reduced social security benefits would be a pleasant surprise compared to their current expectations. Also, it is perfectly reasonable that the age of the start of Social Security benefits should increase as life expectancy increases. I cannot expect future Americans to fund me for 25 years of retirement life when I am currently only funding retirees for an average of about 12 years (80 year life expectancy for women, 74 years for men minus 65 year retirement age). Your expectations are too high and unjust on future generations.\n \nAgain, I feel like you miss the point here. No one doubts entitlements are swelling the debt. Your point, I believe, is that the debt is not currently a huge problem. I'm saying it is because that future obligation is debt we currently have and adding things to it, like another entitlement program or a stimulus bill, only move up the unsustainable date assuming we can get there without having inflation or our creditors bail. Now, assuming we fix the problem today AND balance the budget we still have to pay down our 14 trillion debt. The fix basically admitted a default on most of our loans. The current debt of 14 trillion or so would take decades to pay down meaning raising taxes for less benefits to people....along with the no more social security and medicare. You see what I'm getting at? The longer you wait, the more you screw over the people who, at some point, have to pay it off. The stimulus is not free...that is money I pay back later at a much higher cost. \n\n I see a main difference in our views is that you expect that we will have to fulfill all of our Social Security and HHS requirements as they are now and are expected to become. As I said, most of my generation (Generation Xers) are skeptical that we will get ANY social security so we are fine with changes, such as justifiable increases in retirement age, that can give us a chance of getting some. Again, changes in retirement age are only fair. Also, with health, our current health care costs are much higher than necessary. There are a number of reasons - from high malpractice insurance costs of doctors, to un-necessary proceedures performed. Since other industrialized countries have lower health care costs, then we should be able to lower ours as well. Part of it is being able to have the political will to overcome the power of lobbies. The bottom line is that SS and HHS can change. The GAO even seems to assume this by their call to action for policy changes to change SS and HHS costs. Once we reduce SS and HHS growth problems (I am not so idealistic as to think that we can get them to the point of reducing their GDP percentage), then most of our debt unsustainability problems go away. I get the impression that you are very pesimistic that these costs can be gotten under control.\n \nthis general consensus does not exist. It did tank at the end of 2008 anyway. Furthermore, it looks like it will tank again.\n\n I think your definition of \"tank\" is different than mine. When I hear \"tank\", I think the Great Depression, not just a Recession. Without a stimulus package, we might well have gotten into another Great Depression.",

   "Unless you are claiming that the multiplier effect is larger than the effect of large differences in population and productivity, then my point remains valid that dividing debt by GDP makes more sense in the balance. I can't see how you can deny that being true for long term comparisons. For short term comparisons, it might well be the opposite - that differences in the multiplier effect cause too much disturbance to that short term comparison.\nIt can provide a good look for some points when looking at trends over years but it does nothing when looking whether debt is a problem because of the way money bounces around GDP. My extreme example shows this to be true. It doesn't go away if you use a less extreme example...it is just less bold. You can be the most productive country in the world and still have a problem with debt. The US can't pay debt with population and productivity. \n \n \nSocial Security is still covered by Social Security taxes (at least until 2012 when the amount of money given out to retirees is more than the amount taken in through taxes). I'm not sure what the balance is right now of Medicare and the taxes we pay directly for it. The main problem has been that, instead of saving the surplus that we have had up to now, we have used it / borrowed it to live beyond our means in the rest of our expenses. If we were to leave Social Security and Medicare alone, including investing the surplus instead of spending it, then we would have been fine for much longer than 2012. \nThis is a Ponzi scheme though. You use todays profits to pay for the past donors. Like always they fail. So it is a bit of misstatement to say it is really covered by taxes because those taxes shouldn't have been going to them in the first place. \n \n But right, we are living beyond our means which is a huge problem...NOW. Not so much later. Later it doesn't matter because it is game over. \n \n \nYes, it all comes from the same pool of money, but it wasn't supposed to. We were supposed to spend within our means for the rest of our expenses. Social security was supposed to pay for itself if we had let the surpluses play their actual part. \nDoesn't this seem fishy to you?

You can be the most productive country in the world and still have a problem with debt. The US can't pay debt with population and productivity. \n\n The US can pay for debt when it collects higher taxes due to a higher GDP - at least that is true if it doesn't continue to live beyond its means, even with the higher GDP. Higher GDP means more money to spend, pure and simple. We just need to be wise in how we spend it.\n \nThis is a Ponzi scheme though. You use todays profits to pay for the past donors. Like always they fail. So it is a bit of misstatement to say it is really covered by taxes because those taxes shouldn't have been going to them in the first place.\n\n A Ponzi scheme is, by definition, a pyramid scheme that works under the assumption that there is an ever growing pool of people buying in. Ponzi schemes fail because that pyramid is never infinite. In contrast, Social Security would work just fine with no growth in population of new members. Indeed, if the proportion of seniors supported by Social Security to employees paying social security would stay constant, then Social Security could be solvent forever. The Social Security trust fund was meant to buffer Social Security from fluctuations in population. However, there are two problems that exist with this scheme. First, the Baby Boomer generation produced a large surge in population of a certain age that are now retiring and having to be supported by a gereration (my generation - Generation X) whose population was significantly lower. If this was the only problem, then the Social Security trust fund could have handled that difference until it evened out - i.e. Baby Boomers eventually dying of old age so that the proportion of seniors to employees would go down again. A second problem is that people are living longer yet the age of the start of Social Security has not kept pace. This is something that I think should have been remedied more strongly - i.e. I think that the age of gaining Social Security benefits should have been pushed farther than it had been to remedy that situation. This is the one aspect that has produced too much of a pyramid (more and more seniors being supported by proportionally fewer workers) but it was a political CHOICE to handle it this way because it might have been politically dangerous to take the more agressive but wiser direction of later ages of Social Security benefit starts. A third problem, as we know, is that, instead of investing the Social Security trust fund, we have borrowed from it to live beyond our means. \n \n Either way, Social Security would have worked fine if we had let it work the way it was supposed to work and, also, shift retirement ages (where Social Security was concerned) more appropriately with increasing life expectancy.\n \nBut right, we are living beyond our means which is a huge problem...NOW. Not so much later. Later it doesn't matter because it is game over. \n\n The game doesn't have to be over if we change our ways - especially where SS and HHS are concerned. I agree that we are living beyond our means - we have been for the last few decades (except during the Clinton administration, when we had surpluses and actually paid off some of our debt - both as a percentage of GDP and as an absolute number). So, we can't go to un-necessary wars, we can't support ineffective social policies, we have to raise taxes to support the programs we set up. Republicans and Democrats will disagree with each other but a compromise on spending will have to be reached if we are to ever truly balance our budgets.\n \n However, we continue to disagree whether deficit spending is ever necessary. I continue to think that the Stimulus packages were necessary to avoid a far worse economy. Just because they didn't work AS WELL as expected doesn't mean that they did not work, so your arguement on that point falls flat.\n \n This isn't true because you can't pay for anything with GDP. You haven't explained how GDP matters to any of this.\n \n And it is too late anyway. We already know the future obligation. \n\n Higher GDP means more taxes to spend.

What right wing exaggeration are you talking about?\n\n I am not saying that that particular link was exaggerated. That particular link was so obscure as to be nearly useless. It does not state how much money was printed purely to support the stimulus package. There are many reasons for printing money. A large reason is that our paper currency has a limited lifetime (given how much we put our bills through - stuffing them into wallets, occasionally washing them, etc.) so we have to replace the dollars that start falling apart with new money. Also, when the economy grows, new money has to be printed to support that. I am not familiar enough with the economic theory to understand how much money has to be printed to support normal economic activities. Your link shed no light on the question of extra money being printed to support the stimilus package. My mention of right wing exageration was therefore a general comment since the right wing pundits and supporters do so often exagerate (such exagerations are also not limited to the right wing since many left wing supporters also exaggerate). Whenever I hear a strong arguement (such as our stimulus being largely monetized), I require strong evidence. Without such evidence, I dismiss the argument as being simply an exaggeration. I am still waiting for your clear evidence.\n \nI'm just going to drive home the point with this: National Economic Responsibility\n \n David Walker runs this organization who was the former Comptroller of the GAO (appointed by Clinton)\n\n This website states a $184,000 per capita debt. However, that debt is mainly based on the amount of money each person would have to pay now, at one time, to support all the debt that will be accumulated for many decades to come. Also, that number assumes that we will do nothing for the next fifty years or so about the costs of social security and health and further assumes that health and social security costs will continue to grow at the same pace as they do now (i.e. extrapolated from current trends - which never works since one can never guess well what happens decades down the line). You yourself agreed that policy changes on social security and health can make a difference in what we will owe in the future. Do you disagree? Also, there is no reason to believe that current rates of rise of healthcare costs need to stay the same for decades to come. Now, our healthcare costs about twice as much as in equivalent industrialized countries. Does that mean that, in twenty years, it will cost five times as much? At some point, extrapolations become meaningless when they are based on simplistic numerical extrapolations that do not take changing factors into account.\n \n ----------------\n \n Look, I agree that social security and health care costs will be a problem. I have stated this from the beginning. This is true no matter what extrapolations one uses. We both agree that we have to do something about reigning in those costs. We also seem to agree that, in normal times, we should try to live within our means (i.e. have our government only spend as much as it brings in). We probably disagree with how large we think the government should be - i.e. how much it should spend and, thus, also tax to support that spending - but that is a topic for another thread.\n \n What we disagree on is whether the stimulus package was necessary. So, let me ask you a question. Do you disagree that ANY stimulus package was necessary or is your disagreement based on the way this one was implemented - ex. too much spending, not enough tax cuts, etc. ?",

We really have two options left. 1)the economy improves now and thus the stimulus did nothing because so little of it was spent or 2)the economy proves later which you could never attribute to the stimulus because most recessions have naturally grown out in a few years anyway so who is to say it wasn't natural or that a recovery was actually prolonged by the stimulus. I'm guessing Obama has picked to spread out the package over 2 years because at some point he knows the economy will recover and when it does he will take credit for it. If this is the case than it would be a fallacy on this part. Do you agree?\n \n \nI would rather have a 9% unemployment than a 30% unemployment that might have ultimately happened if we did fall into deep Depression.\nThis reminds me of the argument Bush used to use. \"Well you noticed we haven't been attacked by terrorists recently\". Negative assurance is not assurance at all. For all we know doing nothing could have been 5% unemployment and given that Obama's unemployment chart was wrong I see no reason to trust him or people that support him when they say it would have been worse.\n \n \nI agree that they have to be done now. My main point in challenging you on this was to convince you to agree that the future obligations are not fixed but depend on the policy changes that we make. Do you disagree?\nPerhaps you misunderstood me. I never said they were fixed but that they were actually current obligations and not paying them is basically a default on a loan. I still support this and it is something Daewoo often talks about on these forums. In other words it is something we are supposed to pay just like obtaining a mortgage is something you are supposed to pay. Not paying it via reductions in benefits or whatever is basically saying \"we took money from you and now we can't pay it so you get less back\". This is more similar to say GM reducing pension benefits and any company that does this will suffer a huge credit rating problem. Luckily the government has the benefit of doing this without interference from law (because they can change it). The only problem is what other countries feel about this and if they see us as a credit risk since we can't pay some folks. \n \n \nI am not saying that that particular link was exaggerated.

A large reason is that our paper currency has a limited lifetime (given how much we put our bills through - stuffing them into wallets, occasionally washing them, etc.) so we have to replace the dollars that start falling apart with new money.\nMy apologies. I just gave raw data as you seemed concerned about sources that don't give the entire picture. I can go over what I am talking about but this is the federal reserve so you have to understand kind of how money is printed and why it works the way it does. I'm not sure you can really track which money came from where but this is largely irrelevant because my point is the extra spending from the stimulus has resulted, in part, the monetizing of debt. I'd first google that to see how it is done by the way. \n \n Next go to the website I sent you. You can look at securities held but for simplicity I'll just go with Currency in circulation.\n \n July 19, 2009 = 910,467\n This is +80,562 (in millions) from previous year. That's plus 8.8% YTY\n \n Securities are up 50% YTY. That obviously isn't just replenishing money. You can look at the historical data to verify this. July 2008, for example, shows a YTY increase for securities of roughly 4%. \n \n Considering all other things have been equal one would have to conclude the increase is a direct result of the extra money spent this year via stimulus and TARP.\n \n \nWhenever I hear a strong arguement (such as our stimulus being largely monetized), I require strong evidence. Without such evidence, I dismiss the argument as being simply an exaggeration. I am still waiting for your clear evidence.\nI'm not sure what clear evidence you want. Raw data doesn't exaggerate. I'd be happy to explain it but you have to tell me what you don't understand from the website.\n \n Maybe this will help? Bernanke Op-ed in WSJ: The Fed&#8217;s Exit Strategy - WSJ.com\n \n Keep in mind this is from the federal reserve chairman. I only point out he is talking about the balance sheet and risk of inflation. This only comes if you print money.\n \n \nWhat we disagree on is whether the stimulus package was necessary. So, let me ask you a question. Do you disagree that ANY stimulus package was necessary or is your disagreement based on the way this one was implemented - ex. too much spending, not enough tax cuts, etc. ?\nWe certainly don't need tax cuts. I've never supported this because at some point we have to pay for what others used...this is unfair and wrong but I see no other option. I don't see deficit spending (aka stimulus) as a valid method to get the economy going again. There is no doubt that government spending boosts GDP...even above what was spent by the government (aka the multiplier effect). The problem I see and apparently many states now see is dependency. Once that money goes away you drop then as opposed to now. \n \n In short I disagree the stimulus package was necessary and ANY stimulus package is necessary and I disagree the way this one was implemented. I say the later because it was a forgone conclusion we would have a stimulus package so we should have at least done it the best way we could have...and we didn't. \n \n I really hope you aren't taking this comments too harshly by the way. I do not mean to avoid any questions you ask or try to be dishonest or misleading in any way. Please let me know if I missed something you wanted me to address....I'm very busy these days and often rush these posts.",

If this is the case than it would be a fallacy on this part. Do you agree?\n\n First of all, there were two stimulus packages (so far) - the first being Bush's and the second Obama's. I would think that the first stimulus package had more of an impact than this second one, given that more of it was implemented. So lets start with that question. Do you think that the first one was necessary or that neither was necessary? As for Obama's stimulus package, it has been slower to implement - where it will probably take a full two years to implement. I probably would have prefered a more quickly implemented package but I am not an economist and I haven't been able to read up (yet) on the advantages of one over the other (fast vs slower implementation). Either way, added spending can only boost the economy faster than no added spending. So, government spending can help in getting us out of Recession faster. This is especially critical since everything I have read suggest that this financial crisis has put us in a Recession that is the worst since WWII. So, it was never expected to recover as quickly as normal recessions. We need all the help we can get. How can government spending not boost the economy? Granted that it does add burden to the future (in debt) but I cannot see how one can deny that government spending boosts economies. \n \nThis reminds me of the argument Bush used to use. \"Well you noticed we haven't been attacked by terrorists recently\". Negative assurance is not assurance at all. For all we know doing nothing could have been 5% unemployment and given that Obama's unemployment chart was wrong I see no reason to trust him or people that support him when they say it would have been worse.\n\n Since I am not an expert in economics, I have to look at other factors. What I look at is the fact that most industrialized countries also implemented stimulus packages. I am not so cynical as to think that they were all fools in doing so. They had good reason. You have implied that this was due to populist forces. However, that arguement does not apply to China - a non-democratic country that doesn't care about treading on public discontent (ex. Tienanmen Square, the displacement problems associated with the 3 gourges dam on the Yantze river, etc.). China has one major goal in mind and that is to make sure that their economy continues to grow. Therefore, they have consistently made fairly wise choices when it comes to their economic policies. That helps assure me that their stimulus package that accounts for 8% of GDP was one that was also well thought out. One may argue whether or not our stimulus packages were well designed, but, given the experience of all of these other countries, I hold little doubt that stimulus packages were necessary. The only question in my mind was whether they were implemented well - i.e. of the right type.\n \nPerhaps you misunderstood me. I never said they were fixed but that they were actually current obligations and not paying them is basically a default on a loan. I still support this and it is something Daewoo often talks about on these forums. In other words it is something we are supposed to pay just like obtaining a mortgage is something you are supposed to pay. Not paying it via reductions in benefits or whatever is basically saying \"we took money from you and now we can't pay it so you get less back\". This is more similar to say GM reducing pension benefits and any company that does this will suffer a huge credit rating problem. Luckily the government has the benefit of doing this without interference from law (because they can change it). The only problem is what other countries feel about this and if they see us as a credit risk since we can't pay some folks.\n\n First of all, you seem to hold a view of Social Security that doesn't correspond to its original plan or purpose. Social Security was never designed to be a system that holds on to your money for you. It was designed to be a system that says that, if you support seniors now, future generations will support you when your time comes - a very different system. Also, even if you approach it from the point of view of holding your money, then instead of your arguement \"we took money from you and now we can't pay it so you get less back\", the real arguement would be \"we did not take enough money from you to justify supporting you for as many years as you are trying to force us to support you, so we have no other coice but to reduce the money we give you since your expectations were unrealistic\". \n \n The American people are often financially foolish. As a group, they want to take far more than they give and expect that to be sustainable. We simply haven't given enough money to Social Security to ever let it be sustainable given our ever increasing demands in expecting it to support us for more and more years (given our rising life expectancy). That was never sustainable. Now, we are facing the result of our foolish expectations - lowered benefits. What else could we have expected?\n \nMy apologies. I just gave raw data as you seemed concerned about sources that don't give the entire picture. I can go over what I am talking about but this is the federal reserve so you have to understand kind of how money is printed and why it works the way it does. I'm not sure you can really track which money came from where but this is largely irrelevant because my point is the extra spending from the stimulus has resulted, in part, the monetizing of debt. I'd first google that to see how it is done by the way. \n \n Next go to the website I sent you. You can look at securities held but for simplicity I'll just go with Currency in circulation.\n \n July 19, 2009 = 910,467\n This is +80,562 (in millions) from previous year. That's plus 8.8% YTY\n \n Securities are up 50% YTY. That obviously isn't just replenishing money. You can look at the historical data to verify this. July 2008, for example, shows a YTY increase for securities of roughly 4%. \n \n Considering all other things have been equal one would have to conclude the increase is a direct result of the extra money spent this year via stimulus and TARP.\n \n I'm not sure what clear evidence you want. Raw data doesn't exaggerate. I'd be happy to explain it but you have to tell me what you don't understand from the website.\n \n Maybe this will help? Bernanke Op-ed in WSJ: The Fed&#8217;s Exit Strategy - WSJ.com\n \n Keep in mind this is from the federal reserve chairman. I only point out he is talking about the balance sheet and risk of inflation. This only comes if you print money.\n\n I think I will have to delay in answering this until I educate myself more about the Federal reserve and the various reasons for its outlays, how it lends money, etc. So, I will try to address this at another time.\n \nWe certainly don't need tax cuts. I've never supported this because at some point we have to pay for what others used...this is unfair and wrong but I see no other option.\n\n I think we agree there. Tax cuts can only be implemented if we implement reduced spending, which we don't do. Also, tax cuts often end up being permanent since it is politically dangerous to raise taxes (except on the rich if you are a Democrat). \n \n I don't see deficit spending (aka stimulus) as a valid method to get the economy going again. There is no doubt that government spending boosts GDP...even above what was spent by the government (aka the multiplier effect). The problem I see and apparently many states now see is dependency. Once that money goes away you drop then as opposed to now.\n \n In short I disagree the stimulus package was necessary and ANY stimulus package is necessary and I disagree the way this one was implemented. I say the later because it was a forgone conclusion we would have a stimulus package so we should have at least done it the best way we could have...and we didn't. \n\n My understanding is that, in Keynsian economic theory, such stimulus packages act as a jump start to a lagging economy, that can then maintain momentum largely on its own. It seemed to work to get us out of the Great Depression (though I admit that the subsequent status of the US being one of the only surviving manufacturing powers also helped) and defecit spending during Reagan's time helped get us out of the late 70s recession (though, unfortunately, he decided to keep going with defecit spending even once the recession ended). \n \n Meanwhile, I am still confused about your stance. Do you or don't you think that stimulus packages can be effective if implemented correctly? If so, then what type of implementation would you have preferred?\n \nI really hope you aren't taking this comments too harshly by the way. I do not mean to avoid any questions you ask or try to be dishonest or misleading in any way. Please let me know if I missed something you wanted me to address....I'm very busy these days and often rush these posts.\n\n This is all part of normal debate so, no, I do not view your comments too harshly and hope that you do not view my comments too harshly. Meanwhile, I will continue to highlight points if I think you are avoiding them and you are free to do the same.",

It was just sending a check to everyone. And no, I don't support any of them.\n \n Second, saying spending = economy recover is not accurate. Spending more will boost the economy. This is easily shown that government spending normally does something like a $1.40 increase in GDP for every $1 spent by the government (before interest). The problem is this is borrowed money and one day you wish to stop the spending. What happens when that money stops? The hope is that by that point the economy kicks back in but this hasn't shown to be the case. Like I said earlier, the state of Virginia and many other states are worried about the \"cliff effect\" where you stop spending and revenue drops like a rock. And lets assume a stimulus would help the economy get back into gear, in theory you pay it off which causes a contraction in those years so in the end you are doing nothing more than a smoothing of our economy but thanks to it being borrowed money ends up worse off in the net. So now we have THIS stimulus package which not only won't help but is poorly implemented so we don't even get the benefits that you'd think would come with spending government money.

If you are in charge of a government, like congress, and you say \"I'm going to do nothing about the down economy\" than what do you think your chances are in the next election when the economy is still down? They have to do something and not many options exists. Spending money is always a good one to win support that they are trying. So may say that is cynical but it really isn't.

It was designed to be a system that says that, if you support seniors now, future generations will support you when your time comes - a very different system.\nIt is more like a pension plan but you are missing the point. If a company is going to pay retired employees $100 a month and now they realized they can't and have to pay $50 a month than the stock of that company is going down because it looks like a default. Likewise for the United States.\n \n I use the loan thing because it is easier to follow.\n \n\n I think I will have to delay in answering this until I educate myself more about the Federal reserve and the various reasons for its outlays, how it lends money, etc. So, I will try to address this at another time.\nThat's fine, I am unaware about how much you know regarding the federal reserve and its workings. To be honest, I probably don't know much since it is so complicated. I understand the balance sheet stuff though.\n \n \nI think we agree there. Tax cuts can only be implemented if we implement reduced spending, which we don't do. Also, tax cuts often end up being permanent since it is politically dangerous to raise taxes (except on the rich if you are a Democrat). \nI actually think you have to reduce spending and raise taxes.

One you bombed half the world to nothing and actually had a smart guy decide that all federal money to build factories had to come with a plan to convert to peace time and the other we basically have continued to snowball the deficit spending ever since we did it so there was no end to that \"stimulus\".

As it is, though it is still not healthy, the banking industry has survived because of these stimulus packages. Yes, Obama's stimulus packages hasn't kicked in much yet so it hasn't helped much yet but that doesn't mean that it won't. That just means that its help will be slower but longer lasting. Will there be a \"cliff effect\"? That is not clear. It partly depends on the world recovery, not just our own. China's growth appears to be recovering due to their stimulus package. That can help any momentum attained from our stimulus package to maintain itself through trade. Anyway, the picture is far too complex and unpredictable to say how quickly we will recover. The only thing that is clear is that spending helps that recovery by the simple fact that it boosts industry. \n \nFinally, isn't it the burden for those in favor of the Stimulus to show why and how it worked? To date there is no evidence it does. \n\n Yes and no. It is often difficult to prove how bad things could have gotten if no action would have been taken. We have Black Tuesday and the Great Depression as a comparison where no actions were taken, but the complexity of the differences make an exact comparison difficult. If a hurricane was coming and you boarded up your windows, then how can you prove for sure that, without that boarding up, your house would have suffered major damage? Some things are just too hard to prove. However, one can make an arguement about what could have happened based on logic. Similarly, if most major banking institutions were allowed to go bankcrupt, then it would have been very hard to re-stabilize our financial system and our economy. Our economy could have easily gone into freefall without a banking system to count on for its stability.\n \nWell of course. This brings me to a more important point.

You say that the banks that would have collapsed probably should have but that \"should have\" carries strong economic consequences to this country. If a car is broken, you sacrifice by fixing it - you don't just throw it away - since you need that car and since it is hard to replace. Many major banks were on the verge of bankrupcy.

Again, I do not have any strong base of knowledge in economics so I have to look at those who do - economists, countries, etc. You seem to claim that all countries, including China, were essentially foolish for introducing these stimulus packages. That is a claim that I find weak - especially where China is concerned since they have no democracy to push them into unreasonable directions, as you claim is the reason that democratic countries introduced stimulus packages.

I would be surprised if they had any major objections to us, say, increasing the age at which Social Security starts. We did some of that already (I can't retire until I am 67) and I didn't hear cries around the world of us not being able to meet our obligations. \n \nI'm for smaller government, higher taxes, and less government benefits\n\n I am for moderately sized governments, higher taxes, and government benefits that largely consist of support for seniors and the disabled, and an uncomfortable safety net for those that fall through the cracks (uncomfortable enough to keep them motivated to search for regular employment, etc.). Also, I believe government should try to help get the poor productive - extra help in education, job searching and training, etc. - anything that is actually effective, not just throwing money at the problem.\n \nNo, I'm saying if you are fighting for the survival of our country than naturally you have to build factories in your country to defend yourself and the best way to do this is to make them so they can be easily converted in peacetime....this actually led to a boost because 1) we won and 2) Europe was flat as a pancake. So if by Stimulus you mean bomb every countries factories to nothingness, kill millions of people, build factories in the US for war and convert them to peacetime operations, stop people from buying things for years, and jack up taxes to 80-90% with limited deficits than YES that might stimulate the economy.\n \n This is not realistic.\n\n What about the first years of Reagan's term, where deficit spending helped get us out of the late 70s recession? I think we both agree that it was unwise to continue the deficit spending even after the end of the recession, but did you see no usefullness to his deficit spending at the beginning? Do you not think that his deficit spending helped get us out of recession?",

   "Given how hard it is to prove that a measure made a big difference in what could have been, I'm not sure if there is anything that can be presented as proof that you would accept. The only thing one can present is arguments about the mechanism behind the policy. You say that the banks that would have collapsed probably should have but that \"should have\" carries strong economic consequences to this country. If a car is broken, you sacrifice by fixing it - you don't just throw it away - since you need that car and since it is hard to replace. Many major banks were on the verge of bankrupcy. If they failed, they would have been hard to replace and our economy would have greatly suffered for it.\nThey weren't fixed for one and their failure probably would have a better long run benefit...so yeah, fix it by getting rid of the banks that do bad policies not by giving them more money. Considering many of the banks are already trying to pay off the government it seems that maybe they weren't so bad off afterall. \"Too big to fail\" is a horrific reasoning in my opinion. \n \n \nIt is a generally wise policy to prepare for the worst while hoping for the best.\nThis isn't preparing for the worst because budgets don't work on worse case scenarios...Kaine budgets even more so. Agencies will shut down and people will be laid off because of this. Furthermore, states did assume bad in previous years and it turns out it was even worse. So it's not looking good.\n \n \nI acknowledge that there is a possibility that there might be a cliff effect but it is just as possible, if not more, that there won't. You yourself have said that you place little credence in economic predictions (at least when it came to the crisis). Have you suddenly become converted?\nThese are economists predicting this. This is a state budget department who controls peoples lives. And I don't even really trust them, they have been too high the last 3 years (which is as far as I can remember ha). \n \n \nIf a disaster is heading your way, you try to prepare in any way that makes sense. Giving stimulus to the banking industry in order to keep it surviving was a way that made sense. A failed banking system wouldn't do anyone any good.\nGiving money to bankrupt companies so they won't go bankrupt makes sense? This is at best circular reasoning. If you claim, which you haven't, that it makes sense because they would have failed and caused a big problem and then I say \"well, how do you know this really solved that\" then you go \"because without it they would have failed and caused a big problem\" than it is circular. There is nothing to suggest this works other than to delay a problem. How many personal problems of debt are solved by incurring MORE debt? It only delays it or represents a shot in the dark hoping for the best.\n \n \nYou seem to claim that all countries, including China, were essentially foolish for introducing these stimulus packages. That is a claim that I find weak - especially where China is concerned since they have no democracy to push them into unreasonable directions, as you claim is the reason that democratic countries introduced stimulus packages. I am afraid that your arguements here are weak.\nGovernments are made up of people. You don't always need a democratic incentive to have a foolish policy. In fact, a democratic society would probably be less pron to it because more people are making a decision. In any event, it isn't like China was going to sit back and do nothing. There is still political pressure. They wanted a fix and a government really only have a few things to do...spend money or make a law. Making a law does nothing so they are left with spending money as they only thing they can do...for better or worse. \n \n Just because China has a good economy doesn't mean the government is infallible. They do stupid things as well. All governments here likely to do something stupid here...there is too much pressure not to. Lucky for China spending a few billion doesn't really do much.\n \n \nI would have to see their quoted pronouncements, but I suspect that the instability in the US that they worry about is the unchecked growth of entitlement spending and that we haven't yet done anything about it which, as we know, would lead to unsustainable debt if we continue to do nothing about it. I would be surprised if they had any major objections to us, say, increasing the age at which Social Security starts. We did some of that already (I can't retire until I am 67) and I didn't hear cries around the world of us not being able to meet our obligations. \nChina is meeting with the US today to talk about debt among other things. I also read the China's debt is starting to rise rather quickly as well. This could spell trouble for them and us...probably why they don't want the US to have inflated dollars. It is also self-evident when China stopped buying long-term t-bills earlier this year and then Obama had to beg to get them to start again. \n \n This was from 65-67 for full benefits...with almost no real effect. Perhaps you don't understand what the entitlement changes will have to be. From the GAO report in 2004, which doesn't include recent developments, it seems like probably 30% cuts and/or 40% increases in taxes. That isn't a 2 year old increase. Of course acting now you would have much less problems and probably could get away with cuts assuming you convince China you are still doing ok. The GAO has called for immediate tax hikes and cutting of spending. This is basically what I am advocated...instead we are keeping taxes the same and dramatically increasing spending. All this can do is speed up the GAO predictions. In any event, current fixes require 13-15% reduces in benefits or about the same in increased taxes. Other countries would take notice but what other option do you have? \n \n What I am getting at here is that this is an immediate problem and not \"over blown\". This is why I don't support the stimulus and other spending because it only amplifies the problem at a faster pace making the fix more costly requiring either increased taxes or huge slashes in government or, most likely, both. Even more so when things like the stimulus do absolutely nothing but hurt us long term. \n \n \nnot just throwing money at the problem.\nWhat more can the federal government do? At that high of a level you really have the option to throw money or make laws. If you make laws covering the things you described you have to make them fairly broad and give money to get it going. This is the same thing as throwing money at it. Probably why we should get back to federalism.\n \n \nWhat about the first years of Reagan's term, where deficit spending helped get us out of the late 70s recession?\nWe never stopped incurring this deficit. Furthermore, I'm not sure it did help. \n \n \nI think we both agree that it was unwise to continue the deficit spending even after the end of the recession, but did you see no usefullness to his deficit spending at the beginning? Do you not think that his deficit spending helped get us out of recession?\nYou ask the wrong question. Government spending will always help the economy. If we give everyone $100,000 right now you will see an increase in the economy in the very very short term. It is the long term implications and the \"root\" of the problem that is very fixed. In this sense deficit spending worsened the problem....\n \n And yeah, I'm not convinced the spending did do anything for the recession in the 70s. What evidence is there that this did help!?",

That is inconsistent with their actions over the last few decades. Unless you can show me other examples of economic policies that China implimented in a similarly hypothetically haphazard way, then I continue to find your arguement weak. \n \n Democracies are different since people can vote out politicians who impose unpopular policies - such as raising taxes even when those taxes are needed. There are countless examples of unwise fiscal policy in Democracies - higher spending without raising taxes, lowering taxes when they are not needed and cannot be afforded, un-necessary spending, etc.\n \nChina is meeting with the US today to talk about debt among other things.

You seemed to suggest that China and Russia would be critical of us if we made major changes to reduce the entitlement costs - that they would see that as defaulting on a promise (if I am wrong about this interpretation, then please say so). Given that China has negligible entitlement programs (at least for seniors) and Russia's are quite limited, then I highly doubt that they would have any major objections to our making major cuts in entitlements. They simply correctly surmise that our entitlements will stifle our economy if we don't do anything about them.\n \n So, yes, I agree that we have to both increase taxes and reduce entitlement benefits. I think these countries would applaude such efforts instead of considering them a default on promises. \n \n As for the dramatic increase in spending due to the stimulus, so much of your rhethoric seems to suggest that you think that this is something that we plan on continuing ad infinitum. It is already clear that the public and political will (on the Democratic side as well) has largely dried up for any new stimulus package to be able to pass. Why? Because most politicians viewed stimulus as a costly reaction to our economic crisis and, heck, if you are going to have to spend anyway, then spend on things you want to spend on. However, these were TEMPORARY measures. There is no supported plan to keep on spending as much each year in the way we have spent this year. As for the original two stimulus packages (Bush's and Obama's), we disagree on whether or not they were necessary and I suspect that neither of us will convince each other of their necessity or lack thereof.\n \n Again, the one type of spending that WILL increase year by year (by the very plot that you posted in an earlier thread) is entitlement spending. Lets concentrate on that because THAT is by far the biggest problem that can lead us into unsustainable debt.\n \nWhat more can the federal government do? At that high of a level you really have the option to throw money or make laws. If you make laws covering the things you described you have to make them fairly broad and give money to get it going.

By saying that we should not throw money at the problem, I mean that we need to be wise in where we put that money.

If I fail a test and you give me an A and say \"study next time\" than I doubt I will study. Failure is a motivator. Bailouts are not. If a company needs a short term loan you have risk that the loan won't work. You know who is good at determining if the risk is worth it? The market! Not the government. The government has no risk so they have no incentive to give money to the proper areas the way a free market can. Frankly our federal government is not best equipped to determine what \"executives\" did a good job or not and it is not their problem. It is scary to think that we would want our government determining these things.\n \n \nChina's main goal is economic growth and they are willing to step on the will of their own people in many cases to do it (ex. the Three Gorges Dam project). I haven't yet seen China (post Communist era of course) make any knee jerk decisions on their economy. You seem to be saying that they are doing that now. That is inconsistent with their actions over the last few decades. Unless you can show me other examples of economic policies that China implimented in a similarly hypothetically haphazard way, then I continue to find your arguement weak. \n I don't really understand why you think one government would act much different than another in a similar situation. People in power act remarkably the same way and are only hindered by certain outside obstacles (such as the people in the US). Nevertheless, just look at China freezing their currency as another example....or the really recent development of them increasing their debt amounts. Or better yet, their increase purchases of US debt. China is just acting in their own self interest...whether it will be good or not in the long run. \n \n \nAgain, we both agree that something needs to be done about the ever increasing entitlement spending. You seemed to suggest that China and Russia would be critical of us if we made major changes to reduce the entitlement costs\nI seem to think they would view this as a risk in terms of investing. They could see it as a default and further their talk about an international currency. It is hard for me to say if we are at that point as we speak, Daewoo has better knowledge of this, but I do know we are close. \n \n \nSo, yes, I agree that we have to both increase taxes and reduce entitlement benefits. I think these countries would applaude such efforts instead of considering them a default on promises. \nThe only reason I could see this is if we did it in a manner where we could convince the public it is better than the opposite which is a total collapse. \n \n \nAs for the dramatic increase in spending due to the stimulus, so much of your rhethoric seems to suggest that you think that this is something that we plan on continuing ad infinitum.\nWell the current path suggests that (see CBO projected Obama deficits). We get a CBO update on August 25th I think. Obama's budgets increase each year. This is where % of GDP is actually helpful as well. That will increase each year as we rapidly approach WWII levels without the war (by 2018 projected I think). There is no question the spending will continue.\n \n \n It is already clear that the public and political will (on the Democratic side as well) has largely dried up for any new stimulus package to be able to pass. Why? Because most politicians viewed stimulus as a costly reaction to our economic crisis and, heck, if you are going to have to spend anyway, then spend on things you want to spend on. However, these were TEMPORARY measures.\n Shocking wasn't it? But it didn't last long...we see they came up with a solution for the health care bill. It will be interesting to see what the CBO says about this new one...how much it will increase our costs and how much our gap will increase (currently takes 8.1% of GDP to maintain). I also don't believe the new stimulus talk is over...we are on health care right now but that will be done with in September. I also saw some reports about taxes for the middle class. That is great news! The middle class has no money so it will be a nice killer for us :)\n \n \nAgain, the one type of spending that WILL increase year by year (by the very plot that you posted in an earlier thread) is entitlement spending. Lets concentrate on that because THAT is by far the biggest problem that can lead us into unsustainable debt.\n \nMoney is money. If you spend it on stimulus you can't spend it on entitlements. The stimulus and the extra spending we are adding only provide a catalyst for the entitlement problems to creep up faster. \n \n \nIt is clear that there are some programs that are more effective than other programs. By saying that we should not throw money at the problem, I mean that we need to be wise in where we put that money. Money itself does not guarantee a solution - wise uses of that money are what we need to concentrate on.\nThis is fine but you have to look at the reality here. Since when has the federal government been able to get into details about what is or isn't a good program? They only look at numbers and reports and money. Many congressman, for example, thought the problem with NCLB was it wasn't funded enough. These problems are best fixed at a local level or by society itself. The federal government has shown time and time again it can't do any of the things you want it to do such as regulation, education, and economic growth. Why keep thinking that will change?",

Have a little mid-west bank fail doesn't take down our country...in fact, they might have less intensive to screw up if they were small because the people who put their money in those banks know where the banker lives. Nothing like a gun to your head to do the right thing.\n\n I am sure that you could come up with many anecdotal examples of regulations that did not help. That does not prove that regulations never help. The other issue is that regulations were often not enforced. This was particularly true recently during the Bush adminstration. \n \n However, one can also give many examples of regulations that have helped. For example, I have heard many - both Republicans and Democrats - argue that it was the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (a.k.a. Financial Services Modernization Act), which effectively repealed the the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, that was one of the major causes of our current financial troubles. The Glass-Steagall Act prohibited any one institution from acting as any combination of an investment bank, a commercial bank, and/or an insurance company - thus regulating how much banks could be involved in speculation on the market - the very things that got the banking system in trouble (selling their mortgages on the market, etc.) Of course, the two political parties blame each other for the introduction of that deregulation, but the very fact that they accuse each other is an aknowledgement that it was this deregulation which allowed banks to get away with their financial misbehavior. The criticism from both parties about the removal of this regulation is an aknowledgement that this original 1933 regulation that had been in place up to that time had indeed worked to control the irresponsibility of this portion of the market.\n \n All that says is that there are regulations that are well designed (such as the Glass-Steagall Act) and regulations that are not necessarily well designed(such as the Sarbanes Oxley you mention) and, either way, regulations are ineffective if not enforced. Of course, I support well designed regulations - those that are supported and nurtured by politicians but who are designed by economists - and I would insist that any introduced effective regulation be actually enforced.\n \nWhat can I say...I work with Virginia budget folks on a regular basis and that is what I am hearing so take it for what it is worth. I'd like to point that if it does get better within the next 6 months than Obama is screwed. Not much stimulus money has been spent so it will show the stimulus did nothing. \n \n Like I said, he thinks he is setting himself up for a win-win while I think it is bad for him in that he can't win. Either you didn't spend it and we are better so FAIL or it took TWO years and a recession normally doesn't last four years so he FAILS. He has no way to prove it worked...and no way to prove it failed :)\n\n Partly, this is all a matter of image. As you probably know, presidents who reside over a good or improving economy get credit for it and presidents who reside over a poor or worsening economy often get the blame. Neither is necessarily deserved. However, if the economy improves, then I suspect that the criticisms that you presented will only be agreed to by those who are already against Obama - those arguements will be preaching to the choire. If historical trends continue, Obama should get benefit from such an improvement in the economy - whether he deserves it or not. That is just how American psychology works. People just don't have the time or the interest to investigate the details for themselves and the people who will be hearing the sharp criticism (on Fox News, right wing talk radio, etc) will, again, only be those who are against Obama already.\n \n The only logical way to approach it is to give credit to presidents whose actions directly helped the economy, and blame presidents whose actions directly made it worse. So, if the Economy significantly turns around in a year or two, then a strong argument could be made that the stimulus helped. If it significantly turns around in half a year, then that argument could be harder to present - depending on how much stimulus money was spent up to that point (I hear that the spending rate is increasing). We will have to wait and see.\n \nMaybe fine in theory but it doesn't work this way. If I fail a test and you give me an A and say \"study next time\" than I doubt I will study. Failure is a motivator. Bailouts are not. If a company needs a short term loan you have risk that the loan won't work. You know who is good at determining if the risk is worth it? The market! Not the government. The government has no risk so they have no incentive to give money to the proper areas the way a free market can. Frankly our federal government is not best equipped to determine what \"executives\" did a good job or not and it is not their problem. It is scary to think that we would want our government determining these things.\n\n That is why I don't advocate bailouts with no strings attached. The strings that are attached to bailout money need to represent strong regulation control. Namely, if a bank misbehaves enough for the government to have to help it out, then it loses some of its autonomy until it can prove itself responsible. I understand that there were indeed some strings attached to the bailout money, which was why some of the banks rushed to pay it back quickly.\n \n I don't really understand why you think one government would act much different than another in a similar situation. People in power act remarkably the same way and are only hindered by certain outside obstacles (such as the people in the US). Nevertheless, just look at China freezing their currency as another example....or the really recent development of them increasing their debt amounts. Or better yet, their increase purchases of US debt. China is just acting in their own self interest...whether it will be good or not in the long run.\n\n I just find your arguement of essentially \"they were all fools\" very weak. Governments have REASONS for acting the way they do. Their actions are not all knee-jerk reactions. Many economists and politicians had genuine debates, discussions and brainstorming on these issues before they introduced their respective stimulus packages. You may disagree with their reasoning, but that doesn't mean that they didn't have fully reasoned out arguements. Also, in addition to nearly all industrialized countries introducing stimulus packages, there is the fact that the Bush administration pushed a stimulus package as well - and this being the most ideologically driven administration that I have seen at least in my lifetime. What positive things do you think Bush gained in introducing that stimulus package that could have offset the anger that his stimulus package caused among his Republican constituency? I would think that, politically speaking, he was in a losing situation by introducing that stimulus package. I would argue that this was one of the infrequent instances where Bush let harsh reality drive his actions, instead of pure ideology - a rare instance where I can respect his actions.\n \nWell the current path suggests that (see CBO projected Obama deficits). We get a CBO update on August 25th I think. Obama's budgets increase each year. This is where % of GDP is actually helpful as well. That will increase each year as we rapidly approach WWII levels without the war (by 2018 projected I think). There is no question the spending will continue.\n\n Lets look at the plot that you linked again: http://www.factcheck.org/demos/factcheck/imagefiles/image/2009/3_25_Obama_Prime_Time_Pitch/CBO_Obama_budget_deficit_estimates_march(1).jpg . What can we see on that plot? We see the current peaks in the deficit and then the deficit GOES DOWN EVERY YEAR UNTIL 2012. Why does it go down? It goes down because the stimulus was only meant to be TEMPORARY. This very projected deficit plot that YOU linked proves this. Then, why does it go up starting in 2012? It goes up because the year 2012 marks the point at which the money we pay out in Social Security and Medicare benefits starts being greater than the money we bring in in Social Security and Medicare taxes and, given the growth in the population of seniors, this keeps rising. This very plot (YOUR plot) proves my point: the stimulus deficits are TEMPORARY and the growing deficits will grow once ENTITLEMENT deficit spending starts to really take off.\n \nThis is fine but you have to look at the reality here. Since when has the federal government been able to get into details about what is or isn't a good program? They only look at numbers and reports and money. Many congressman, for example, thought the problem with NCLB was it wasn't funded enough. These problems are best fixed at a local level or by society itself. The federal government has shown time and time again it can't do any of the things you want it to do such as regulation, education, and economic growth. Why keep thinking that will change?\n\n Some programs will never become effective so that, after trying to fix them enough, it makes sense to give up on them. Otherwise, there are programs that are effective and the government judging these programs based on these progress reports and financial numbers can lead it to throw out the bad and keep the good. Of course, as we all know, the government does not act purely rationally. Politics gets in the way. So, for example, if there is a particularly influencial congressman who supports an ineffective program (if it is bringing money to his state, for example), then chances are that that ineffective program will stay. However, just because there are negative examples does not mean that ALL programs are ineffective. Thinking about some of the most effective programs I have heard about, the GI Bill comes to mind - a bill which significantly helped in the growth of the middle class by giving out educations to returning WWII soldiers.",

   "For example, I have heard many - both Republicans and Democrats - argue that it was the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (a.k.a. Financial Services Modernization Act), which effectively repealed the the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, that was one of the major causes of our current financial troubles. \n\n \n This has been shown to be wrong time and time again. More often than not regulation has a nasty habit of not working or causing less competition and ending up doing the reverse of what it was supposed to do.\n The truth is, however, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act had little if anything to do with the current crisis. In fact, economists on both sides of the political spectrum have suggested that the act has probably made the crisis less severe than it might otherwise have been.\n\n http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2...ic_crisis.html\n \n Since the great depression we have had the two securities acts (33 and 34) along with Sarbanes Oxley and a few other big ones inbetween that tried to regulate financial markets is some fashion...these aren't solving any problems compliance becomes a huge expense which can cause a barrier to entry for small companies. I got a friend who is the compliance officer at a 2 branch bank...he is the highest paid employee including the bank manager. The only way they can survive is that they do so many loans to farms. Oddly enough they were small enough to fail so they didn't engage in stupid activities like Citi.\n \n \nPartly, this is all a matter of image. As you probably know, presidents who reside over a good or improving economy get credit for it and presidents who reside over a poor or worsening economy often get the blame. Neither is necessarily deserved. However, if the economy improves, then I suspect that the criticisms that you presented will only be agreed to by those who are already against Obama - those arguements will be preaching to the choire. If historical trends continue, Obama should get benefit from such an improvement in the economy - whether he deserves it or not. That is just how American psychology works. \nIt goes both ways. There is a good chance the economy will be ok by the time Obama is lot of office so he take easily take credit for it and naturally will. Likewise you will see the supporters cheering without just cause. This is the same thing with the New Deal. People look back and see GDP went up during the New Deal but you can't just look at that as proof. You have long term consequences, other factories, natural cycles, and the whole time you want everyone doing something when nobody has tried doing nothing to see if you achieve the same result. \n \n \nThe only logical way to approach it is to give credit to presidents whose actions directly helped the economy, and blame presidents whose actions directly made it worse. So, if the Economy significantly turns around in a year or two, then a strong argument could be made that the stimulus helped. If it significantly turns around in half a year, then that argument could be harder to present - depending on how much stimulus money was spent up to that point (I hear that the spending rate is increasing). We will have to wait and see.\nIn a year or two? That would be 4 years in a recession far exceeding the normal 1.5 years. Four years could easily be a naturally occuring thing and no one is to say it could have been 3 without the stimulus. \n \n \nThat is why I don't advocate bailouts with no strings attached. The strings that are attached to bailout money need to represent strong regulation control. Namely, if a bank misbehaves enough for the government to have to help it out, then it loses some of its autonomy until it can prove itself responsible. I understand that there were indeed some strings attached to the bailout money, which was why some of the banks rushed to pay it back quickly.\nWhy do we need the government to do this for us? This is easily done by the government going out of business and a smaller bank picking up the slack and doing a better job and becoming bigger. Furthermore, there is no such thing as a no strings attached bailout. Realistically this just wouldn't ever happen. If there is one thing I've learned from Daewoo it is you have to look at the reality and forget the theory sometimes :)\n \n \nI just find your arguement of essentially \"they were all fools\" very weak. Governments have REASONS for acting the way they do.\nI don't think they were fools at all. I just don't think they acting in the best way to help their economy. Politically, China was smart to do such a thing but it doesn't appear to be panning out. Exports are still in the crapper which is not good because their economic model is starve the people and make others give us their money. Furthermore, China has a rapidly increasing debt that could hurt them in the future. \n \n \nMany economists and politicians had genuine debates, discussions and brainstorming on these issues before they introduced their respective stimulus packages.\nAnd a large number said doing a stimulus is not needed. These same \"economists\" stated unemployment wouldn't go to 9% but here we are.\n \n \nLets look at the plot that you linked again: http://www.factcheck.org/demos/factcheck/imagefiles/image/2009/3_25_Obama_Prime_Time_Pitch/CBO_Obama_budget_deficit_estimates_march(1).jpg .

So regardless of it going down we still have a deficit higher than every single one under Bush after inflation. This only speeds up the entitlement problem which is a mere 3 year away. And like I was saying earlier, the fix gets more and more expensive the longer we wait. Are we just going to start denying coverage for medicare patients? That should be good for Obama Health Care. Are we going to stop supporting seniors? Seems so...at some point we have a huge cost problem and tacking on a bailout here and a stimulus there just adds fuel to the fire when we should be worrying about getting some water to put it out.

   "I was away on a long weekend trip and the first days this week were busy, so this response has been lagging a bit. However, I've managed to hunker down and get a response out.\n \nThis has been shown to be wrong time and time again. More often than not regulation has a nasty habit of not working or causing less competition and ending up doing the reverse of what it was supposed to do.\n \n http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2...ic_crisis.html\n \n Since the great depression we have had the two securities acts (33 and 34) along with Sarbanes Oxley and a few other big ones inbetween that tried to regulate financial markets is some fashion...these aren't solving any problems compliance becomes a huge expense which can cause a barrier to entry for small companies.

Oddly enough they were small enough to fail so they didn't engage in stupid activities like Citi.\n\n I can imagine that compliance can cause companies un-necessary money when regulations become so complex that it takes many highly educated employees to simply make sure that the company is compliant. I would love to see regulations be simple enough to follow without such efforts but the reality of the situation is that companies chasing profit often find unusual loopholes in regulations, which then make the regulations more complex on the next go-around - a vicious cycle. I suspect that such complexities can arise due to regulation solutions being implemented piecemeal instead of the entire regulation being re-worked. However, no matter what the current problems are with regulations, it is far better to restructure regulations than to get rid of them all together. An unregulated market is a very dangerous one for the people that depend on that market. If banking was an industry, such as chicken production, that could always be outsourced, then I wouldn't be as worried. It is precisely those markets that can most affect people's lives and which cannot be outsourced that need regulation most.\n \n As for your link, it made the point that the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act was not the main cause of the current financial crisis and that it actually helped matters once the crisis actually hit. However, they do make the point that \"In 1998, regulators had allowed Citicorp, a commercial bank, to acquire Traveler's Group, an insurance company that was partly involved in investment banking, to form Citigroup. That was seen as a signal that Glass-Steagall was a dead letter as a practical matter, and Gramm-Leach-Bliley made its repeal formal.\" Indeed, I have subsequently read that the Glass-Steagall act has slowly been undergoing cuts since at least the 70s and significantly more in the 80s on. This is summarized in frontline: the wall street fix: mr. weill goes to washington: the long demise of glass-steagall | PBS . Though your link does say that Glass-Seagall was already dead by the time Gramm-Leach-Bliley came along, it does not address the question of whether Glass-Seagall would have worked to prevent the crisis if it hadn't been cut apart so often in the last decades. The link concentrates more on debunking the finger-pointing among the two parties than it does on any detailed discussion of regulation effectiveness.\n \nIt goes both ways. There is a good chance the economy will be ok by the time Obama is lot of office so he take easily take credit for it and naturally will. Likewise you will see the supporters cheering without just cause. This is the same thing with the New Deal. People look back and see GDP went up during the New Deal but you can't just look at that as proof. You have long term consequences, other factories, natural cycles, and the whole time you want everyone doing something when nobody has tried doing nothing to see if you achieve the same result.\n\n Unfortunately, such effects are hard to disentangle. One cannot conduct an idealized experiment that unequivocally shows that spending oneself out of Recession ultimately does more good than harm. There are too many subtleties that those of opposing view can point to - subtleties that also cannot be unequivocally proven. So, all we can do is conduct our economies as makes sense to the party currently in charge. It makes sense to me that government spending would boost economies. We shall see, I suppose, whether the cliff that you are concerned about actually materializes.\n \nIn a year or two? That would be 4 years in a recession far exceeding the normal 1.5 years. Four years could easily be a naturally occuring thing and no one is to say it could have been 3 without the stimulus.\n\n Everything I heard at the beginning of this crisis was that this was no normal recession and that our current economic crisis risked falling into being another Great Depression. I would be very releived if, after all of these government efforts, our recovery would be as fast as in a normal recession.\n \nWhy do we need the government to do this for us? This is easily done by the government going out of business and a smaller bank picking up the slack and doing a better job and becoming bigger. Furthermore, there is no such thing as a no strings attached bailout. Realistically this just wouldn't ever happen. If there is one thing I've learned from Daewoo it is you have to look at the reality and forget the theory sometimes :)\n\n The banking industry is far too important to our economy to let it fail. Look at what happened in the Great Depression. It was bank failure on a massive scale that caused it. I would far prefer bailing out the banks, even if that bailout is not as efficient or fair as one would like it, than risk a repeat of that economic disaster. As for bailouts with no strings attached, I have since read that it was certain banks fear of the public pushing for the introduction of massive strings to that bailout money that convinced many banks to quickly pay off the bailout money. I personally wish that the bailout money would have forced banks to loan out money faster than they have been, but at least saving the banks means that credit markets have not completely disappeared - they are just slower than hoped.\n \nI don't think they were fools at all. I just don't think they acting in the best way to help their economy. Politically, China was smart to do such a thing but it doesn't appear to be panning out. Exports are still in the crapper which is not good because their economic model is starve the people and make others give us their money. Furthermore, China has a rapidly increasing debt that could hurt them in the future.\n\n China is so dependent on foreign consumer spending that it might not start to recover its earlier growth until the rest of us recover. Unless China builds up its own significant Middle Class, its economy will remain very sensitive to foreign consumer demand. \n \n Meanwhile, Japan, France and other countries are heading out of Recession - all countries that implemented bailouts or spending. I suppose that one way of comparing the effectiveness of bailouts and spending is to compare countries that implemented them in this crisis to similar countries that didn't. I personally haven't gone through that analysis, and it is still a bit early to judge. Are you familiar with any relatively rich industrialized country that did NOT impliment any bailout or spending - where one can then use that country as a comparison?\n \nAnd a large number said doing a stimulus is not needed. These same \"economists\" stated unemployment wouldn't go to 9% but here we are.\n\n I would rather have 9.5% unemployment than the 25% unemployment of the Great Depression. Differences of 1% from prediction don't concern me nearly as much when you had the threat of another Great Depression looming over us.\n \nMy point is that the Obama budgets are an increase over every president for every year on that schedule. So regardless of it going down we still have a deficit higher than every single one under Bush after inflation. This only speeds up the entitlement problem which is a mere 3 year away. And like I was saying earlier, the fix gets more and more expensive the longer we wait. Are we just going to start denying coverage for medicare patients? That should be good for Obama Health Care.

Seems so...at some point we have a huge cost problem and tacking on a bailout here and a stimulus there just adds fuel to the fire when we should be worrying about getting some water to put it out. I feel like your argument is basically that it is ok to add insult to injury.\n\n Longer recessions will certainly not help the US get out of debt faster or solve the health care issues any faster. It is a balancing act. Add slightly more extra debt now to help in recovery since, without recovery, any chance of tackling the total debt or growing health care costs is even more remote.\n \n As for health care reform, I think that ALL parties need to think about how to reduce health care costs. It doesn't help when one party, the Republican party, is engaged in stupid tactics of calling the plans \"Socialist\", \"Kill Granny\", or \"Death panels\" INSTEAD of holding intelligent rational discussions. I would very much welcome rational discussion on health care since I am sure that there are rational opposing points that can be presented at this early stage of debate to try to lead health care reform in the right direction. The town hall meetings were meant to allow for those rational discussions. It is a pity that the Republicans are messing up this chance for apparently purely partisan purposes (as some Republican pundits have openly said, destroying the health care reform initiative would highly damage Obama politically - a good goal in their eyes). I would be happy to have bipartisan health care reform that is effective and which both parties can claim credit for. But, for that to happen, a RATIONAL debate has to happen. I bemoan the current lack of rationality in the debate.\n \nNot do they have a definition of success. How does Wal-Mart know it is doing something right? Basically they have a net profit for year that meets or exceeds what they thought (aka a goal). In the federal government how to you measure whether or not No Child Left Behind worked and what was the goal in the first place? Higher graduation rate? That would take over a decade to figure out.

This is much easier to measure at a local level where you can easily tell if a policy is working because of more direct interaction.\n\n Performance on standardized tests can measure student scholarly performance. It is not perfect, but it is better than simple graduation rates or people failing a grade since expectations for graduation or for passing a grade can vary wildly from school to school. Either way, I don't see much benefit of the decisions being made and the programs being run more locally. This might be fine for the richer districts that can afford any program they want, but the poor districts of the US are the ones that have the great majority of the social, educational, crime problems. They NEED national (or at least state) government involvement since they cannot afford the programs on their own. Though I live in a reasonable neighborhood, I would be fine with subsidizing programs in poorer neighborhoods through my taxes - both out of a sense of compassion and also, more selfishly, since one can only tackle crime and social problems at their source (in the poor neighborhoods) and, if they remain untackled, then that can eventually affect me in my neighborhood as well. It is all part of being in a civilization - a recognition that we cannot only have responsibility over ourselves and our family, we need to extend that sense of responsibility more widely.",

Even if Keynes was right in theory he is wrong in reality because the government just doesn't create huge government programs and spend tons of money only to stop that later on. \n \n The cliff effect thing will only happen if the economy maintains and no bailout happens. This is a concern for state governments because they lag behind the normal economy in terms of revenue. We might see it better with this cash for clunkers thing.

That has been my point. \n \n \nThe banking industry is far too important to our economy to let it fail. Look at what happened in the Great Depression. It was bank failure on a massive scale that caused it. \nIt is interesting to note that the federal reserve was formed a few years before the Great Depression. Not letting the market work itself out probably caused a normal correction to become much worse. So I'm not sure it was so much \"letting the banks fail\" as it was trying to manipulate the banks in the first place. Fail or not you still would have had a problem. Keep in mind 1929 was part 1. In 1937 you had another crash..probably worse...and you can't just blame no bailout for that one. \n \n In the end, this is a global thing dealing with natural corrections.

Differences of 1% from prediction don't concern me nearly as much when you had the threat of another Great Depression looming over us.\nIt wasn't 1% and you can't compare it to the great depression. It was over 1% worse than the worst estimates assuming no stimulus.

There are people really worried about it and rightfully so. \n \n Frankly it is never going to happen that you get a rational debate on this issue with our congress. What you will get is a watered down version of the current bill to make the fiscal \"conservative\" folks somewhat happy. So at the end of the day we have a costly bill and terrible health care. \n \n You want to fix health care than have the congress stay out of it. \n \n \nPerformance on standardized tests can measure student scholarly performance. It is not perfect, but it is better than simple graduation rates or people failing a grade since expectations for graduation or for passing a grade can vary wildly from school to school.\nBut nothing compared to a school evaluating their students progress. Standardized tests are horrific measurements of performance. They assume we are all the same. Seeing students as unique only comes at a localish level. \n \n \n Either way, I don't see much benefit of the decisions being made and the programs being run more locally. This might be fine for the richer districts that can afford any program they want, but the poor districts of the US are the ones that have the great majority of the social, educational, crime problems.\nAnd you can't solve that at a federal level. \n \n \nThey NEED national (or at least state) government involvement since they cannot afford the programs on their own.

It is all part of being in a civilization - a recognition that we cannot only have responsibility over ourselves and our family, we need to extend that sense of responsibility more widely.\nI'm not talking about funding. I'm talking about policy. Then again, money does play an issue because you can throw tons of money at an intercity school and it will still be horrible. In fact, I live in a city that has that exact problem. Per student they get much more than the surrounding counties. \n \n In the end what we are arguing here is about size of the federal government in what they can do. I'm simply saying look at the past and notice the government can't run programs very well and thus should be limited. We shouldn't trust that a stimulus will save us when no evidence supports that. We shouldn't trust them to solve a deficit problem since them spending money on the people is what gets them elected anyway. All my arguments about failed policies and budget deficits boil down to a federal government that is too large to sustain. Go back to the constitution and we won't go the way of the Romans.",

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act was not \"one of the major causes of our current financial troubles.\"\n\n If you retrace this particular set of arguements in the thread, you will see that it started by you claiming that regulations do not work. I then pointed to Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 as a regulation that did work - which you have yet to successfully refute. In that post, I also said that this was proven by the finger pointing toward Gramm-Leach-Bliley that killed it. Given your post and subsequent investigation, it became clear that Glass-Steagall was already dead by the time that Gramm-Leach-Bliley came around.\n \n So, I have no problem agreeing that Gramm-Leach-Bliley was not the main cause of the crisis, given that Glass-Steagall was already dead. That was a side point anyway that did not have high importance. The main point I was presenting was that Glass-Steagall could have prevented the crisis. That is still unrefuted. It was an example of a regulation that had helped for decades and was unfortunately torn apart even before new forces set in in the late 90s to destabilize the market.\n \nIT makes sense to me too but I am only concerned when the spending ends because, in theory, it has to. Even if Keynes was right in theory he is wrong in reality because the government just doesn't create huge government programs and spend tons of money only to stop that later on.\n\n On what basis do you claim that government never stops programs once they are started?\n \nThe cliff effect thing will only happen if the economy maintains and no bailout happens. This is a concern for state governments because they lag behind the normal economy in terms of revenue. We might see it better with this cash for clunkers thing. If auto sales maintain in September and October than perhaps the cliff effect is not a huge concern anymore for private companies. This assumes the government doesn't do anything else with the auto industry. \n\n With cash for clunkers, my impression is that it was intended to be a longer-term, less active program. Its success seems to have caught the politicians that made it by surprise. As a stimulus, it probably would have worked better if it had indeed been a slow moderately successful program - long enough to tide the automakers over until the economy recovered. Since it burned out so quickly, I do expect that we will see some cliff effect in auto sales.\n \n That might be similar to what would have happened if the main stimulus package had been a quickly used up deal. If you stimulate too much, too quickly, then you have a greater risks of cliff effect than if you stimulate more slowly to have a slower, but more adiabatic effect - i.e. one that can achieve a growth that maintains some equilibrium that can maintain itself.\n \nIt isn't a normal recession but there is no evidence we avoided a depression. That has been my point.\n\n What type of evidence would have convinced you that we avoided a depression? Given how hard it is to prove a \"what could have been\" in any situation, I am quite curious about what answer you might give to this question.\n \nIt is interesting to note that the federal reserve was formed a few years before the Great Depression. Not letting the market work itself out probably caused a normal correction to become much worse. So I'm not sure it was so much \"letting the banks fail\" as it was trying to manipulate the banks in the first place. Fail or not you still would have had a problem. Keep in mind 1929 was part 1. In 1937 you had another crash..probably worse...and you can't just blame no bailout for that one.\n\n When people were running on the banks to withdraw all of their savings at the start of the Great Depression, what market forces do you imagine would have prevented the banking collapse? \n \n As for the 1937 crash, it had a minor effect on the general trend of per capita GDP in the Great Depression - as seen on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GDP_depression.svg . According to this plot, the US GDP started to turn around as soon as FDR came into office and introduced national programs, regulations, monetary reform. The relatively non-interventionist stance of Hoover years were years when the market could have corrected itself and didn't - at least not enough to generate any growth or turn-around in GDP.\n \nEveryone did some kind of stimulus from what I know. Still nothing indicates they worked. Politics require you to do something.\n\n Many of these countries are now emerging from Recession. That can only be a good sign. Also, though I haven't looked into it myself, I will take your word for it that Every country had some kind of stimulus. That in itself is also a sign that introducing such a stimulus was important. You claim that it was purely politics. Theoretically, that is possible but not in the least bit probable. If stimulus had been an economically bad idea, then it would be improbable that EVERY developed country would have followed it.\n \nIt wasn't 1% and you can't compare it to the great depression. It was over 1% worse than the worst estimates assuming no stimulus. That is what I don't trust them.\n\n Again, are we talking only about Obama's stimulus or of both Obama's and Bush's stimulus packages? When I speak of stimulus, I always speak of both. I would say that Bush's stimulus did more to keep us from Depression than did Obama's - the risk of Depression was much greater in late 2008 and was much alleviated by that stimulus package. Obama's stimulus package has only partly kicked in so its effect has only been partly felt. Since there were far fewer voices warning of Depression during that time, my main impression was that the stimulus was meant to get us out of a protracted Recession much sooner. History will tell how much of an effect it really had. We will have to wait for the analysis.\n \n Either way, when you say that unemployment was worse than the \"worst estimates assuming no stimulus\" , where are you getting that information? Given that, in late 2008, there were a very large number of economists warning of dire consequences of another Great Depression, I find your claim hard to believe.\n \nYet with no evidence to support the idea that adding debt now helps us get out of a recession it seems silly to me.\n\n You seem to flip-flop on the question of whether or not spending helps. In one reply, you say that, yes, spending helps but that you worry about future debt. In this reply, you seem to be saying that spending doesn't help. So, which is it? Does spending help economies at least short term or not, in your view?\n \nDon't blame the republicans because the democrats are pulling the same stuff. Frankly the town hall things aren't all partisan things. There are people really worried about it and rightfully so.\n\n What do you mean - \"democrats are pulling the same stuff\"? It is Republicans who were the ones coming in as hooligans disrupting the town hall meetings. I would have welcomed rational critical questions as long as they allowed for actual debate that could lead to constructive changes. Instead, you get mere hecklers. Eventually, since these hecklers would not go away, Democrats started sending in their own protesters but that never would have happened if there hadn't been weeks of Republican organized hecklers disrupting town hall meetings to begin with. I will grant that, in the 60s, you had massive left-wing hecklers disrupting any meaningful dialogue. I was just an infant during those times so I obviously could not comment then but, ever since I became politically aware, I have always criticised the extremes that protesters go to. My brother often goes on left-wing protests and I have often criticised him about how useless those are in making any real change and that, if he wants real change, he should concentrate on writing his congressmen, writing to his local papers, getting out the vote, etc. - i.e. constructive efforts. Hecklers of any political ilk are useless drains on the important work of a Democracy and such irrational protests serve no other purpose than to entertain the emotions of the heckler.\n \nFrankly it is never going to happen that you get a rational debate on this issue with our congress. What you will get is a watered down version of the current bill to make the fiscal \"conservative\" folks somewhat happy. So at the end of the day we have a costly bill and terrible health care.\n\n Congressmen want to get re-elected so they do look at polls of public opinion. Public opinion, in turn, can be swayed by the arguements presented in rational debate. Instead, it is being swayed by a disinformation campaign and ridiculous rhethoric of \"Socialism\", \"death panels\" and \"killing Grannies\". I would much prefer to have a debate concerning the costs of health care, how to pay for it (i.e. what to tax), how to control future growth in costs, etc. I am sure that the Democrats plan is far from perfect and that, if ACTUAL RATIONAL debate were happening from the Republican side, then the Republicans could introduce arguements that would make most people think. Instead, Republican rhethoric is dominated by such paranoia - drowning out any real rational arguements that they might actually be making.\n \nYou want to fix health care than have the congress stay out of it.\n\n Who can have the authority to fix health care if not Congress? You don't seriously think that the insurance companies can fix the problem themselves, do you? Otherwise, do you advocate keeping the status quo and doing nothing about healthcare?\n \nBut nothing compared to a school evaluating their students progress. Standardized tests are horrific measurements of performance. They assume we are all the same. Seeing students as unique only comes at a localish level. \n \n And you can't solve that at a federal level. \n \n I'm not talking about funding. I'm talking about policy. Then again, money does play an issue because you can throw tons of money at an intercity school and it will still be horrible. In fact, I live in a city that has that exact problem. Per student they get much more than the surrounding counties.\n\n Without programs helping to get kids off the street in poor neighborhoods, the problem could be worse. I certainly think that any social programs need to be checked for effectiveness, but you can't make blanket claims if you want to be taken seriously. Social programs are neither all good nor all bad. One has to judge them on a case-by-case basis. \n \nIn the end what we are arguing here is about size of the federal government in what they can do. I'm simply saying look at the past and notice the government can't run programs very well and thus should be limited. We shouldn't trust that a stimulus will save us when no evidence supports that. We shouldn't trust them to solve a deficit problem since them spending money on the people is what gets them elected anyway. All my arguments about failed policies and budget deficits boil down to a federal government that is too large to sustain. Go back to the constitution and we won't go the way of the Romans.\n\n It is illogical to make blanket generalizations on anything the government does. You seem to be making such blanket generalizations. Instead, I argue for judging each government program on its own merits. That is the only fair way. I would fully agree with you that programs that do not work (after giving them enough years of trying) should be cut. This should be just as true for military expenditure as it is for social programs. We should look at ALL government expenditures and judge them for their effectiveness - keep the good, chuck the bad.",

Perhaps you are talking about a different part of the act? \n \n \nOn what basis do you claim that government never stops programs once they are started?\nThe significant increase in government expenditures would be one piece of evidence. Entitlements is another. Increase is cabinet positions and overall government agencies is evidence of this. In fact the only cabinet positions to be removed were basically navy and army to form the DOD. A moot point though.\n \n \nWith cash for clunkers, my impression is that it was intended to be a longer-term, less active program.

In any event, how do you call it a success if it has a cliff effect attached? \n \n \nThat might be similar to what would have happened if the main stimulus package had been a quickly used up deal. If you stimulate too much, too quickly, then you have a greater risks of cliff effect than if you stimulate more slowly to have a slower, but more adiabatic effect - i.e. one that can achieve a growth that maintains some equilibrium that can maintain itself.\nWasn't the argument that the stimulus was not given out quick enough just a little while ago? This seems ever changing and with no evidence.\n \n \nWhat type of evidence would have convinced you that we avoided a depression? Given how hard it is to prove a \"what could have been\" in any situation, I am quite curious about what answer you might give to this question.\nThat seems a bit unfair. You're the one that thinks this not I. But if you want, I'd be convinced if you found a country that did not have stimulus and suffered greatly because of it. Good luck though, every major country passed one which is not evidence that it is a smart idea (unless you count politically smart).\n \n \nWhen people were running on the banks to withdraw all of their savings at the start of the Great Depression, what market forces do you imagine would have prevented the banking collapse? \nThe banks already collapsed at this point.

In 10 years they revised the deficit to go up another $2.7 trillion from the previous estimate. (total of $7 trillion in 10 years).\n\n The total debt (not yearly deficit) after ten years was indeed expected to go up by about $2 trillion more (to a total of ~$7 trillion increase in 10 years) - mainly to reflect the slower than hoped for recovery, as I understand it. However, it is important to note that the budget deficit will be dropping every year until 2013 (from ~$1.6 trillion this year to about $530 billion in 2013) and then start to rise as health care and social security cost growth really kicks in - as I have been saying. This can be seen in the CBO projections at http://cbo.gov/ftpdocs/105xx/doc10521/budgetprojections.pdf . I have also read that, outside of obvious crisis spending, the deficit grew because of the Bush tax cuts, which expire in at the end of 2010. Obama, probably for political reasons, will only continue the lower taxes for those families earning under $250k and will let the tax cuts expire for those who are wealthier - effectively raising their taxes back to pre-Bush levels.\n \n Anyway, by 2013, any increased deficit due to the latest spending spree should have largely peetered out and we will be back to the type of deficits that we saw under Bush (i.e. \"normal\" times before the crisis) - at least until the deficits start growing again due to social security and health costs.\n \n I agree that, during \"normal\" non-crisis times, we should try to keep within our budgets. This means cutting costs or increasing taxes or both. But where do you cut? By far, our main expenditures are entitlements (Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare) and the military. We haven't really discussed what it means to cut those programs (which we would have to do) or how to increase taxes (more on the wealthy, more on the middle class?). Since Social Security and, more so, health costs will be the fastest to rise, those should be most targeted, but military spending should also be considered. Are you willing to have such a discussion?",

   "Ugh, these long threads are too much effort. \n\n I would agree that we are probably starting to get diminishing returns from these long posts and this discussion might be naturally winding down anyway. So, I will just make relatively short summaries to your main points here: \n \nMy arguments are repeating but I can summarize my points:\n \n - Deficit is a problem now with not a good fix (and yes it relates to medicare, SS)\n\n Yes, I agree that the deficit is a problem. It is peaking this year due to the stimulus package, then reducing steadily until it hits a pre-crisis low (not low enough) in 2013, then starts rising again as health and SS costs increase. If it were not for the rise after 2013, then our national debt would still be sustainable. So, the main problem we have to address is how to keep those deficits from climbing into astronomical territory because of health and SS costs - i.e. how to keep health and SS costs from climbing. The issue of the justification of the high 2009 deficit (due to the various bailouts and stimulus packages) is addressed in another point.\n \n- The bailout was a bad idea because it only makes the deficit problem worse and has shown no evidence of actually helping our economy truly recover. \n\n Given all of the hype all over the world about fears of a second Great Depression if nothing would be done, given that all industrialized countries had some version of bailout / stimulus package, and given that a Bush administration idiologically opposed to such government intervention felt compelled to introduce it, I have every confidence that they were not all following foolish purely political decisions but decisions based on solid reasoning. So, I have full confidence that bailouts / stimulus packages of some sort were necessary. The only doubts I have is whether they were done as effectively as they could have been.\n \n- Obama is spending more than any other president\n\n Given the economic crisis, that is not in the least bit surpising. The real test for Obama will come in a couple of years once the crisis is mainly over. Of course, he will then be battling higher health care and SS costs, so his challenge is greater than that of previous administrations. However, he will continue to get my respect as long as he makes a strong effort to cut un-necessary spending (closing down ineffective programs, making some tough choices on reducing SS and health care costs, etc.).

The issue of the justification of the high 2009 deficit (due to the various bailouts and stimulus packages) is addressed in another point.\nI don't foresee any president actually addressing this until it is too late. We have always been a country of change only when you have to. The problem with that, unlike many other crisis like Global Warming, is that you know basically when the end is and what the consequences will be. Because of this I feel it should be prioritized.

   "Oil price fluctuates? Don't be mistaken. This doesn't mean oil getting any cheaper.\n \n Hey everyone! \n \n We all know that for the past month or so oil price has been quite uneven - now it may go above $70 per barrel, next moment it recedes again. For some people such price fluctuation may seem encouraging. Sure, by the end of August oil price hit the level of $72 per barrel and then it got 2 solid dollars cheaper! But wait! \n Just don't raise early hopes. It is common knowledge that starting from late summer till mid fall is a period of general reduction in oil requirement. Just in two or three months oil consumption would regain the value, this is when oil price would start rising again. Oil just can't go cheaper because OPEC tries to keep oil quotes at the same level now and there are developing countries like India, Brazil and, first of all, China so they will need more oil for their developing industry.",
