It is really a \"non-tactic\", and merely just a re-statement of their position: \"I am opposed to changing the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples in the marriage laws because that would change the definition.\"\n \n It is semantically indistinguishable from saying, \"I don't like the idea of same-sex marriage.\"\n \n When objectively assessing the pros and cons, there are no valid arguments against same-sex marriage, except for biblical admonitions (which are not really objective, anyway.)",
