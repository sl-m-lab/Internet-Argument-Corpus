Faith is for those who wish to make slaves of their brains. You can't have faith if you have a backbone and are educated in the matter. And speaking of brains, researches and neuroscientist have recently learned of a genetic flaw in a specific gene called vmat2 that religious people have. This defective gene makes the persons brain more susceptible to having faith because the act of \"having faith\" supplies certain addictive chemicals to the brain which, over time, they become addicted to. Imagine that. This has all been verified by the Institute of Human Genetics. That's the whole reason why religious groups and religious parents have to always \"train\" children how to have faith. It's very much like drug addiction, only their \"drug\" is supplied by their religious faith. They start them off young when the children don't know any better, then they fill their heads with cute stories and rhetoric, and then they use a tactic known in psychology as \"argumentum ad nauseam\" which is when someone makes a false statement or something that is purely made up, and through prolonged repetition people begin to believe that the false statement is true (you see this tactic also used during an election). Now if the children start to ask too many questions, or if they don't just blindly adhere to the faith demanded by those trying to instill it in them, then they use fear tactics to get the children back in line. Often it is in the form of \"if you don't believe in such-and-such, then God will punish you\" or \"don't question your faith or it will show God that you are weak\". Etc. etc. Any of this sound familiar? emoticon_xgood",

Faith is just knowing that something is true, without the requirement of proof. I dont need proof, I certainly dont need a gut feeling, and I dont need to be educated to know God is real, and Jesus is who and what the bible claims him to be. I know this just as I know the sun is going to rise in the morning and set in the evening. I did not aquire faith through any of your posted \"tactics\", I came to faith as an adult, not a child. And as far as this new research you quoted, its either rubbish, or a feeble attempt to tell people who have faith that they are fools. In any event, it is just redicule plain and simple, and God has said that true christians would always face redicule, so by people like you rediculeing me, you only prove it more that God is real.",

   "\"Faith is believing what you know ain't so\" Samuel Clemens.\n\n \n \n No, penfold, Faith is: Hbr 11:1 \n NOW faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\n Hbr 11:2 \n For by it the elders obtained a good testimony.\n Hbr 11:3 \n By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible.\n Hbr 11:4 \n By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and through it he being dead still speaks.\n Hbr 11:5 \n By faith Enoch was taken away so that he did not see death, \"and was not found, because God had taken him\";[fn1] for before he was taken he had this testimony, that he pleased God.\n Hbr 11:6 \n But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.\n Hbr 11:7 \n By faith Noah, being divinely warned of things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his household, by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.\n Hbr 11:8 \n By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place which he would receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going.\n Hbr 11:9 \n By faith he dwelt in the land of promise as in a foreign country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise;\n Hbr 11:10 \n for he waited for the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.\n Hbr 11:11 \n By faith Sarah herself also received strength to conceive seed, and she bore a child[fn2] when she was past the age, because she judged Him faithful who had promised.\n Hbr 11:12 \n Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born as many as the stars of the sky in multitude--innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore.\n Hbr 11:13 \n These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off were assured of them,[fn3] embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.\n Hbr 11:14 \n For those who say such things declare plainly that they seek a homeland.\n Hbr 11:15 \n And truly if they had called to mind that country from which they had come out, they would have had opportunity to return.\n Hbr 11:16 \n But now they desire a better, that is, a heavenly country. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.\n Hbr 11:17 \n By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,\n Hbr 11:18 \n of whom it was said, \"In Isaac your seed shall be called,\"[fn4]\n Hbr 11:19 \n concluding that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead, from which he also received him in a figurative sense.\n Hbr 11:20 \n By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.\n Hbr 11:21 \n By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.\n Hbr 11:22 \n By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel, and gave instructions concerning his bones.\n Hbr 11:23 \n By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king's command.\n Hbr 11:24 \n By faith Moses, when he became of age, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,\n Hbr 11:25 \n choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin,\n Hbr 11:26 \n esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in[fn5] Egypt; for he looked to the reward.\n Hbr 11:27 \n By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible.\n Hbr 11:28 \n By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, lest he who destroyed the firstborn should touch them.\n Hbr 11:29 \n By faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land, whereas the Egyptians, attempting to do so, were drowned.\n Hbr 11:30 \n By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were encircled for seven days.\n Hbr 11:31 \n By faith the harlot Rahab did not perish with those who did not believe, when she had received the spies with peace.\n Hbr 11:32 \n And what more shall I say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and Barak and Samson and Jephthah, also of David and Samuel and the prophets:\n Hbr 11:33 \n who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,\n Hbr 11:34 \n quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became valiant in battle, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.\n Hbr 11:35 \n Women received their dead raised to life again. Others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.\n Hbr 11:36 \n Still others had trial of mockings and scourgings, yes, and of chains and imprisonment.\n Hbr 11:37 \n They were stoned, they were sawn in two, were tempted,[fn6] were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented--\n Hbr 11:38 \n of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and mountains, in dens and caves of the earth.\n Hbr 11:39 \n And all these, having obtained a good testimony through faith, did not receive the promise,\n Hbr 11:40 \n God having provided something better for us, that they should not be made perfect apart from us.",

   "Well Colonel Idiot, you can say what you want, but absolutely no where in the bible does it say that a person has to know the history of the bible to be saved, it states that faith in Jesus Christ alone saves, not history, not works, not believing for sure. So I think your post is a load of horse ####, and I am not a man of religion, I am a man of faith, and there is a difference. You might be more educated in some areas than me, but I guarantee I am more educated in other areas than you, so I wouldnt be calling me ignorant, or uneducated as you put it. And as far as proving you wrong, I fail to see the need to even attempt it, as anything I say you will only argue it, thus making it a waste of my time and energy.\n\n \n \n Now, there is the good old Christian morality I am talking about. Using insults and attacks, and talking about 'Faith in Jesus' same sentence. It seems like a certain type of Christian feels that their 'faith in Jesus' gives them the right to be abusive to all people who 'don't have faith'. Then they play the martyr game when people react badly to their behavior. \n \n If that is what 'faith' does, well, I want no part of it. I will just point out one more quote from Jesus 'By their fruits you will know them'. \n \n When you post on these forums, and talk about your 'faith in Jesus', your actions are going to influence how people view Christianity in general (fairly or not so fairly).

   "Tell me, is it the faith that has you saved?? According to some passages , \n faith without works is dead. .. and the sheep are separated by the goats due to their works.\n \n Yet other passages in the New Testament say 'Jesus came for the whole world, especially (but not exclusively) for the ones who believe' \n \n Now, I don't particularly subscribe to what the New Testament says, but it's a shame that more Christians don't know and understand what their own holy books think is the recipe for living together. They are more concerned about other people's actions, but can't see 'the plank in their eye because of the moat of their brothers'\n \n I might change my mind about Christianity when I see Christians following through on the message that Jesus taught, but that doesn't seem to be very likely in the foreseeable future.\n \n My cultural heritage is a very works based religion. Some of the sayings of the Christian religion have similarities, but alas it is so rare that you actually see Christians live up to the standards they hold others to.\n\n \n Faith without works is an easy one to understand, it simply means that if a person trully has faith, he will work at keeping Gods commandments, and if he fails, then he has true remorse for it. And if a person claims to have faith, and is not truly doing his best to do as God says, then his faith is false. I know what faith without works means, I just dont really know how to explain it properly without doing a lot of typing to avoid confusion, but basically I have explained it as best as I can.",

   "Wow, I just have to say that Sinjin, Trebor, And Colonel, have shown me what a fool I have been for believing in God, and trying to live my life as a good and God fearing person, I guess now since there really is no God, I can just act like some kind of hate mongering heathen with nothing to fear from a higher power who says not to act like that(heathen). Man if we had leaders like you, and our kids were taught to believe as you three do, our society would be so much better off. We would have more crime, less morality, churches could shut down and not help strugling people with things like food and bills, we would be able to remove \" In God we Trust\" from our money and replace it with \"We dont trust or believe in squat\". And by the way, if God is not real as you have plainly made me see, why is Gods name on our money, why is Gods name in our pledge of allegiance, why have people believed in God and the bible since before you and I were ever thought of, before your fancy psychology was ever thought of, for that matter why do we have AD and a Bc eras. I once heard on the news that Nohas Ark had been found, but hoe is that possible. I guess I will just keep on being the fool that yall think I am by believing in God, I am a lot better off in many ways.\n\n \n \n And there you go again.. first of all, misrepresenting all the things everyone has said, and second of all, bringing up that red herring of 'In God We Trust'. \n \n You see, you are mixing up what your basic beliefs are with how you are acting. I do think it is very amusing that the Knights of Columbus, in an effort to 'show how different we are from the Godless Commies\" have tricked the Christians of this country into the worshiping of Idols. They turned the pledge into a prayer, and the flag into an idol, and Money into a God.\n \n Do keep on bringing up all these things about 'Noah's ark' and such. I guess you hear a sound bit on TV, and believe it hook line and sinker. It demonstrates to me what has to be changed in the schools on that we should teach people how to listen critically, and to actually learn things. I find that knowledge is the enemy of both religion and right wing fundamentalism. When people can actually learn and understand things on their own, and to be able to critically process information, they tend to stop being red neck fundamentalists, and can actually contribute to society.",

   "trying to live my life as a good and God fearing person\n\n The very fact that you would fear God for anything shows that you do not know anything about God. I don't think your view of God does him much praise. LOL ;)\n \n If you need a prop or an unpleasant frightening emotion to be a good human being, then you're probably doing it for all the wrong reasons anyway.\n \n \nMan if we had leaders like you, and our kids were taught to believe as you three do, our society would be so much better off.\n\n That's the first smart thing that you said :)\n \n \nWe would have more crime, less morality\n\n Actually it couldn't be any worse then it is right now. More people historically have died at the hands of religious wars then non-religion. Religion has been used to push extreme political viewpoints, selfishness, racism, destruction of whole cultures, hatred, and ignorance. Wow that's something for you to be proud of eh grizzly6626? emoticon_rolleyes Through religion, televangelists have become pimps where cash is more important than integrity. While I haven't seen any atheists with bombs strapped to themselves, we've all see plenty of religious fools blowing themselves up each and every day. And of course we all know how peaceful and charitable The Spanish Inquisition was. I guess it's true, when it comes to religion IGNORANCE is bliss...\n \n BTW - you forgot to mention that hitler was a devout catholic.\n \n Yeah, like I said before, it couldn't be any worse then it is right now emoticon_xbye\n \n \nchurches could shut down and not help strugling people with things like food and bills\n\n Actually just as many atheist help the needy. \n \n Of course a person would need to be open-minded to realize it. Here is one such atheist charity. If you were open-minded about such things then you would have learned that both Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, who have each individually made the two largest charitable donations in American history, are both atheist (Oops, bet that's gotta kill your argument, huh?) and they can rightly claim credit for spurring many other ultra-rich to also be charitable. \n \n Ted Turner, the multi-billionaire, has also donated millions to others, and guess what grizzly6626, he's an atheist too! \n \n George Soros, also a multi-billionaire, financier and philanthropist, has also donated millions and is also an atheist. The list goes on and on. You just don't hear about these people donating because they tend to do these things quietly, and not with a lot of *cough* religious *cough* fanfare.\n \n Didn't mean to wake you up grizzly6626 emoticon_xbye\n \n BTW - many catholic charities are known to turn the needy away. I've heard many accounts about how when some people first got married back in the 1970s, that catholic charities wouldn't help them out because they were not \"good, church-going catholics.\" Basically because they didn't go to church every week (and put in their money filled envelope) the Church didn't consider them worthy of help.\n \n You see, it isn't because religion makes people morally better than atheism. Rather, it would be because churches often organize charitable activities and encourage their members to participate, while atheists, simply have no comparable social structure. It's not that churchgoers have a superior moral sentiment, just that because of their increased social structure they naturally have increased opportunity.\n \n There are countless amounts of people who are atheist that donate from the heart. They do not 'band together' into groups like religions do, and they do not advertise their charitable works like religions do, but they donate from the heart just the same. Here is a partial list of many such individuals who just happen to also be atheist. But it goes MUCH further than that though. There are a few organizations formed by atheists for the sole purpose of donating to those in need. One such organization is called S.H.A.R.E. - Secular Humanist Aid and Relief Effort. Here is a recent story about them helping those in need. So, when someone ignorant and closed-minded like grizzly6626 tries to convince you that 'only religions' donate or help those in need, you will now know that it's simply not true, and that people from all beliefs, even those that don't believe in God, help others in need and donate from their hearts, because they know it's the right thing to do for their fellow man in need emoticon_idea\n \n \nI once heard on the news that Nohas Ark had been found, but hoe is that possible.\n\n No it's not. There never was a Noahs ark. There was nothing to be found. The Jews ripped the story off from the Sumerian story of Gilgamesh. The bible contains nothing more than half-truths and comic-book science. If the entire Earth was covered by water as the \"story\" suggests, then where did all of that extra water go? Oh wait that's right, even though the Earth is a closed biosphere, according to delusional religious pawns like grizzly6626 the water must have been vacuumed up by space aliens for use on their own planet, or maybe noah snapped his fingers and it just magically disappeared. LOL emoticon_xbye grizzly6626, if you were half as smart as you 'think' you are then you'd realize that if there were that much water covering the surface of the Earth then the atmosphere would have become inhabitable. Oops... guess faith and fact don't mix? LOL emoticon_xgood\n \n Only a fool would believe what the the bible says about \"Noah was 600 years old when the floodwaters came on the earth.\" \n \n Here is a more simplistic explaination. Enjoy emoticon_xgood\n \n \n I guess I will just keep on being the fool\n\n You won't get any argument there emoticon_xbye\n \n Why would an omnipotent, omniscient being need to be worshipped anyway? Your notion that God lacks something that only we can give him makes God look weak and as if he were suffering from low self-esteem. \n \n ...either that or some religious cretin came up with the idea and found a bunch of even bigger fools to also believe it, and so they kept passing this story down through the generations.

If God, and subsequently Christ as well, does not exist, then why do we have two time eras, the bc era and the ad era. If Christ is not real, and Christ was not cricified on a cross as the bible states, then why does the cross have so much importance even today. I am well aware that people were crucified on crosses as a means of punishment, but the cross has not been recognized as significant for 2000 years just because a common thief was crucified, someone very important had to be crucified. Also, if God does not exist, how do you account for your soul, or do you not have a soul either. And if you believe you do have a soul, but dont believe in God, then where did your soul come from. Do you believe your soul was just created from thin air, what happens to your soul when your body dies. Using reasoning and logic are fine, but you cant use enough logic and reasoning to explain away everything in the bible. And some of you use other relegions to deny the bible as being true, but(and dont quote me on this one, as im not positive), if other religeous writings predate the bible, then why is it that we dont have two time eras from their writings(religeons and beliefs), why does the bible speak of the crucifiction of Christ with two thousand years of significance for the cross to back it up. Do you think you were decended from monkeys as some say we are, or would you actually consider the fact that there is one God, who made us different, and loved us enough to send his only son to suffer and then die on a cross, so that if we would only believe, we would never suffer the death of our soul. This does not mean that our soul actually dies as the body does, it simply means that your soul would be dead to God.

And that defies the rationale that all of this came about through random mutations so that each stage of life compliments every other stage of life both below and above it by sheer accident, or by pure chance.\n \n By you saying one word: PLANTS. You're implying that they stand apart from the interdependent relationships of all life on Earth. but you know they play an integral part in the chain of life.\n\n \n No where did I claim rain and soil were organisms.

This got complicated when different countries tried to discuss events they labelled differently...\"Is Grizzly year one the same as Archie year seven and Esme year two...\"\n 300 years later, give or take, it became accepted as the preferred starting point by the church. Gradually it spread out through the Roman Catholic church, and to the countries in which the church had a presence. Those countries gradually expanded and formed their empires around the world and took their calendar with them.\n In short, the system we use was in the right place at the right time. It was chance. \n As Archangel pointed out there are several other calendar systems operating in non-Europeanised areas of the world today.

   "Ok genius, what relegions was the story of Jesus stolen from.\n\n Boy they really have you TRAINED well emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Open up a porthole in your brain and learn the history of the real bible:\n \n There were many mythical figures who all had the same story line as Jesus. Here are two of them on how the story of Jesus may have started (a third was Buddha). Most of this can be documented in the book 'The power of Myths\". The book (and matching video from most libraries) are an excellent source of information and was a first shown on PBS. Keep in mind that this fable proceeded the one about Jesus, so it was well known BEFORE the story of Jesus was written. It should also be noted that the very first christians addressed their prayers to 'Our Lord the Sun' - evidencing that 'primitive' Christians were quite in the spirit of Pagan forms and ideologies. Interestingly the Egyptian sun god Horus, had pre-dated the Jesus character by thousands of years. The story of Jesus shares the following with the story of Horus:\n \n \u0095 Horus was born of the virgin Isis-Meri on December 25th in a manger.\n \u0095 His birth was being announced by a star in the East and attended by three wise men.\n \u0095 His earthly father was named \"Seb\" (\"Joseph\"). \n \u0095 He was of royal descent.\n \u0095 At age 12, he was a child teacher in the Temple.\n \u0095 A aget 30, he was baptized, having disappeared for 18 years.\n \u0095 Horus was baptized in the river Eridanus or Iarutana (Jordan) by \"Anup the Baptizer\" (\"John the Baptist\"), who was decapitated.\n \u0095 He had 12 disciples, two of whom were his \"witnesses\" and were named \"Anup\" and \"Aan\" (the two \"Johns\").\n \u0095 He performed miracles, exorcised demons and raised El-Azarus (\"El-Osiris\"), from the dead.\n \u0095 Horus walked on water.\n \u0095 His personal epithet was \"Iusa,\" the \"ever-becoming son\" of \"Ptah,\" the \"Father.\" He was thus called \"Holy Child.\"\n \u0095 He delivered a \"Sermon on the Mount\" and his followers recounted the \"Sayings of Iusa.\"\n \u0095 Horus was transfigured on the Mount.\n \u0095 He was crucified between two thieves.\n \u0095 He was buried for three days in a tomb, and then resurrected.\n \u0095 He was also called the \"Way, the Truth, the Light,\" \"Messiah,\" \"God's Anointed Son,\" the \"Son of Man,\" the \"Good Shepherd,\" the \"Lamb of God,\" the \"Word made flesh,\" the \"Word of Truth,\" etc.\n \u0095 Like Jesus, \"Horus was supposed to reign one thousand years.\"\n \u0095 Horus fed thousands (5000 to be exact) with just a few loaves of bread.\n \u0095 Horus was called \"the KRST,\" (pronounced Christ) or \"Anointed One.\"\n \u0095 He was \"the Fisher\" and was associated with the Fish (\"Ichthys\") and the Lamb.\n \n Another famous myth of the time where elements of Jesus appears is in the story of Mithras, which predates the story of Jesus by 600 years! As noted below the Orthodox Christian hierarchy is practically identical to the Mithraic version. Virtually all of the elements of the Orthodox Christian rituals (wafer, doxology, water baptism and alter) were stolen from the Mithra and earlier pagan religions. Jesus had the following similarities with Mithra, as the sun god (there's that sun worshiping aspect again) of ancient Persia:\n \n \u0095 Mithra was born on December 25th as an offspring of the Sun.\n \u0095 Both had virgin births.\n \u0095 Next to the god Ormuzd, Mithra held the highest rank among the gods of ancient Persia. Next to God, Jesus holds the next highest rank.\n \u0095 He was represented as a beautiful youth and a mediator.\n \u0095 He was considered a great traveling teacher. \n \u0095 He had twelve companions (Jesus had twelve disciples). \n \u0095 Mithra was called \"the good shepherd,\" \"the way, the truth and the light,\" \"redeemer,\" \"savior,\" \"Messiah.\" \n \u0095 He was identified with both the lion and the lamb.\n \u0095 Could also redeem the souls of the dead into heaven.\n \u0095 Ceremonies included a sort of baptism to remove sins, anointing, and a sacred meal of bread and water, while a consecrated wine, believed to possess wonderful power.\n \u0095 The mysteries of Mithras, which fell in the spring equinox, were famous even among the many Roman festivals, much like Easter is today among christians.\n \u0095 Purified themselves by baptism.\n \u0095 Their conceptions of the world and of the destiny of man were very similar.\n \u0095 They both believed in the existence of a Heaven inhabited by beatified ones, situated in the upper regions, and of a Hell, peopled by demons, situated in the bowels of the earth.\n \u0095 They both placed a flood at the beginning of history.\n \u0095 Both performed the same exact miracles.\n \u0095 They both believed in the immortality of the soul, in a last judgment, and in a resurrection of the dead.\n \u0095 They both had disciples which formed an organized church, with a developed hierarchy. \n \u0095 They both possessed the ideas of Mediation, Atonement, and a Savior, who is human and yet divine, and not only the idea, but a doctrine of the future life.\n \u0095 They both had a Eucharist or \"Lord's Supper.\"\n \u0095 They were both buried in a tomb and after three days they both rose again. Their resurrection was (is) celebrated every year.\n \u0095 They both had the sacred day of Sunday, \"the Lord's Day.\"\n \u0095 \"I am a star which goes with thee and shines out of the depths.\" - Mithraic saying\" - I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright morning star.\" - Jesus, (Rev. 22:16)\n \u0095 Both were believed to be mankind's savior.\n \u0095 Both were known as the Light of the world.\n \n The story of jesus also stole many things from Buddha, which also preceded the story of jesus by thousands of years. Now one or two similarities I can see, but when you can comprise a long list of story line as shown above, that speaks volumes to the open-minded person. \n \n Now my question to you is this, why spend so much time memorizing what your religion wants to spoon feed you, when you could use that same time to learn the truth about where religions came from in the first place? Don't you think that God wants you to know the truth? I'm talking about the REAL truth, not a \"version\" of it that has been sold to you for the purpose of keeping their religion thumping along. The ONLY way that you will ever learn the unvarnished truth is by doing your own independent research. Be willing to learn it with an OPEN mind, and you'll be surprised what a little truth and light can do for you.",

Researches have found a defective gene that makes certain people attracted and addicted to religion. There are now many books on the subject proving it's real. That's got to be scary for you huh? It works the same way as drug addiction and it's funny how similar both addictions are in symptoms, and how both groups react when the thought of loosing their drug (or religion) is realized. Your last post was a good example of it, so thanks for that emoticon_xgood BTW - you still have never answered our question.\n \n Why would an omnipotent, omniscient being need to be worshipped anyway? \n \n Seems you've hit a brick wall. One that you don't like to think about because if you did, then it would be the first 'crack in the wall' toward disproving what you've been programed to believe. Your notion that God lacks something that only we can give him makes God look weak and as if he were suffering from low self-esteem. \n \n \nYou call me and others names just because you disagree with what we believe, and you constantly redicule us. \n\n Yeah I feel the same way about Archangel. Weird emoticon_xbye\n \n \nI am not willing to concede that almighty God is filled with hatred towards his own creations, and that God lacks love and compassion for us.\n\n I never said that, YOU did ;)",

   "But for me to have to pick a life vest with no time to decide on which vest is actually right is not the same thing as having years to decide, it has to be an immediate decision, so I guess I would just grab one and hope for the best. But at least I took one, rather it was the right one or not.\n\n I agree that you have years to decide which life vest is for you. This is one reason why your scenario of a drowning man being offered a life vest was not a very good one. That is why my second scenario was placed in a farmer's field. In that scenario you are being offered something that someone claims to be a life vest, but you are not in dire need of it at that moment, so you have some time to decide whether to accept it or not.\n \n Your problem now is somewhat different. You are offered this object that is claimed to be a life vest (let's say it's inside a box), but you will not find out if it is indeed a life vest until you have need of it. The only evidence you will have to go on is lots of other people (who also have no idea what is in your box) telling you that they believe you have a working life vest. In the next field is someone else giving out similar boxes, as there is in the next field and the one after that. Which box do you accept? Remember that you will not find out if you have chosen the right box (or whether you should have chosen at all) until you open the box (ie when you snuff it). Or maybe you 'll just snuff it and never know.\n \n My belief is if you claim your god to be a just and fair god, then he would not cast you down into the depths of hell just for choosing the wrong life vest. Such a god would be a petty god. A just god would look at your life and how you have treated those around you, and would award you accordingly.\n \n So, let's say you are in a field and there are ten men, nine giving out boxes that they says contain life vests (claiming that you will need it some day), and just one man giving out cards with instructions on how to swim. Which would you take?\n \n Smiley",

You can interpret it anyway that you want, but the medical reasearch has been proven regarding the gene. Of course you don't want to admit anything bad about yourself, but you don't know if you have this gene. A person who first hears that they have cancer, or learns something that they want to deny has the same reaction. You might want to do yourself some good and study up on how the brain handles such news when it is in denial. The brain does this to protect itself. Here is a primer:\n \n \nThere are two types of denial. The first type of denial is an emotional one. Something has happened that is so terrible, or so frightening that they just don't want to deal with it. The second type of denial comes from changes to the brain. The brain literally refuses to process certain types of information. For example, there is one type of injury to the brain where the patient cannot receive visual information on the left side. Their vision is gone on the entire left side-but they don't know it. They may bump into walls, or, if driving a car, they may run into things. If drawing a picture, they may leave out half the drawing. The brain doesn't like missing information, so it tends to fill in that information. You may be thinking that you don't know anyone who has part of their vision missing. Think again! Did you know that part of your vision has a hole in it? Where the optic nerve comes through on the eyeball, there are no visual receptors. The brain doesn't like missing information and \"fills in\" that little hole. If you close your left eye, hold a pencil about one foot from the eye (down and to the right), the eraser will just disappear when you find this small hole. So, now you see how the brain can contribute to \"denial.\" link\n \n \n I challenge you to look up any independent unbiased medical website which talks about how the brain handles addiction and/or events when it is in 'denial' - and not find that you have most of those same 'symptoms. Here's one example\"\n \n \nJust as the human body has an immune system to protect it from dangerous physical organisms, the human mind has a mental immune system to protect it from overwhelming pain and problems. That mental immune system is called a psychological defense system. The goal of this psychological defense system is to protect the integrity of our mind and personality.\n \n Denial is one part of this defensive system. It is activated whenever we are asked to think or talk about a painful or overwhelming problem-what I call Painful Reality. There is nothing sick, pathological, or wrong about this. Denial is a normal and natural human response to severe pain and problems.\n \n Everyone uses denial every day. The brain has an automatic screening system called the Reticular Activating System (RAS) that forces it to block out certain perceptions that it is programmed to consider irrelevant. In states of normal stress, the brain locks onto to signals that have pay value (this is good for me) or threat value (this is bad for me). Everything else gets blocked out or unconsciously denied.\n\n \n Best of luck with this. Seriously :)",

As far as denial is concearned, I have long since come to the reality that I will die at some point, so if I were told I only had a week to live by my doctor, I would make preperations for it, but as I personally know of a couple of instances where doctors have been wrong on this, I would just live my life normally.

   "Hi,\n \n I stumbled across this thread today and just read through it with a good bit of interest. I consider myself relatively neutral in this debate--I'm a pretty open-minded guy and am willing to entertain the possibility of God and/or Jesus while still being pretty uncomfortable with the \"Believe in me or burn!\" mentality that Jesus supposedly espoused.\n \n I have a few questions particularly for the Christians that were spurred by a conversation I was having with my fiancee the other night. Let me know what you think, if you get the chance.\n \n 1. My fiancee was recently put on the spot about Jesus and while confessing her admiration for the person he supposedly was and his example, also admitted she just could not believe he was the son of God. She really wants to--she believes in God, and she sees the conviction with which people accept Jesus as God, but just cannot make that leap. Is she defective? Is there something wrong with her brain that gives her this insurmountable doubt? And if so, was that doubt then created along with the rest of her by God?\n \n 2. Is there gap in scientific understanding such that the existence of the soul is necessary to explain anything in human consciousness? I admit to being pretty ignorant on this topic, but it seems to me that if the soul can be eliminated by Occam's razor (and perhaps even if it can't), how is it fair to punish us for anything we do or don't do? How can we be judged for acting on the impulses created by our nervous system?\n \n 3. I've seen it thrown around on this thread that nature's existence proves that of God. Surely complex systems can develop gradually on their own--I understand that it may be unlikely, but given the massive scale of the universe, it must have had to happen sooner or later. What exactly do you see in the world that just simply could not have had any genesis other than from God?\n \n 4. The estimated number of Christians in the world, according to Wikipedia, ranges from 1.5 to 2.1 billion. While that's a lot, it is at most less than a third of the world's population. For many in the other two thirds, there is a religion entrenched in their psyche and culture just as much as Christianity is in ours. How can it be fair for God to judge them the same as us? I mean, consider if you lived in Tehran. You've heard the Gospel, but if you were to convert, you would be cast out, rejected by everyone you've ever known and loved, and possibly executed. Why would you expect them to do that, especially given that Islam embraces Jesus as a prophet and professes to be an extension of the Judeo-Christian tradition? You would think \"Even if they're right, I'm still on the right track.\" But they would probably think that no more than you would accept Judaism.\n \n 5. There are errors and contradictions in the Bible. From that I can only draw two conclusions:\n \n a. The Bible is the work of man, and is therefore no more infallible than anything else.\n \n b. The Bible is the work of God or divinely inspired men, and God is just trying to screw with us for some reason.\n \n Which is it? I am possibly willing to accept God's existence sans holy text, but how can we trust anything the Bible says about him or his son when it contains errors and is internally inconsistent? Since Thomas Jefferson was mentioned a few times, I thought I'd throw this in:\n \n Notable among those who concluded that the Bible contained deliberate falsehoods was Thomas Jefferson. He considered much of the New Testament of the Bible to be lies. He edited his own version of the bible and omitted what he considered to be these falsehoods. He described these as \"so much untruth, charlatanism and imposture\". He described the \"roguery of others of His disciples\", and called them a \"band of dupes and impostors\", and described Paul as the \"first corruptor of the doctrines of Jesus\", and wrote of \"palpable interpolations and falsifications\". He also described the Book of Revelation to be \"merely the ravings of a maniac, no more worthy nor capable of explanation than the incoherences of our own nightly dreams\". --Wikipedia\n \n Again, what evidence do we have that this is not true? Faith is a difficult subject, because it inherently requires no evidence. But how can we construct an entire belief system on a document that appears to be either a) the work of fallible men or b) a deliberate attempt to mislead and confuse us?\n \n Like I said, I'm open to your arguments, and I'm especially interested in #1 and #2, which have been the biggest obstacles to my accepting any religion that requires belief for salvation.",

That puts you one step ahead of many others in solving this issue.\n \n Before I can answer your question you need to ask her if she feels nature and God are inter-related.\n \n \nIs there gap in scientific understanding such that the existence of the soul is necessary to explain anything in human consciousness?\n\n There is no proof that people have a soul. There is no proof that they don't. Science has not yet evolved to the point of answering that question, but they have found a defective gene that most religious people have. It makes them addicted (for lack of a better word) to religion. The question now becomes; did God deliberately put that gene in some people so that they can \"phone home\" - or is it just a defective gene fooling them into becoming vulnerable to religions dogma?\n \n \nWhat exactly do you see in the world that just simply could not have had any genesis other than from God?\n\n This is a question that you probably should have asked Albert Einstein. He said \"God does NOT play dice\". The more that Einstein discovered in science, the more that he believed that a \"god\" of some sort must have started it all. Einstein did not believe in religion, or a cosmic santa claus version of God, but he did believe that a 'power' much greater than mankind must exist. He said \"I believe in a God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.\" When asked to explain God he said \"We are in the position of a little child entering a huge library filled with books in many languages. The child knows someone must have written those books. It does not know how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written.

That, it seems to me, is the attitude of even the most intelligent human being toward God.\" \n \n In-fact most highly acclaimed scientist of our time feel the same way. They feel that the amazing design of the universe could not have happened by chance or mistake. This site explains some of the incredible things that the universe has to offer that could not have happened by sheer luck.\n \n \nThe estimated number of Christians in the world, according to Wikipedia, ranges from 1.5 to 2.1 billion. While that's a lot, it is at most less than a third of the world's population. \n\n Yes, and there are less everyday.\n \n \nconsider if you lived in Tehran. You've heard the Gospel, but if you were to convert, you would be cast out, rejected by everyone you've ever known and loved, and possibly executed. Why would you expect them to do that\n\n A rational person wouldn't. A fair and just God would not put a person in that position either.\n \n \nThere are errors and contradictions in the Bible. From that I can only draw two conclusions: a. The Bible is the work of man, and is therefore no more infallible than anything else. b. The Bible is the work of God or divinely inspired men, and God is just trying to screw with us for some reason. Which is it? \nThe bible is a man-made book, written to try to explain things far out of the grasp and understanding of the people of those times. Way back when cavemen roamed the Earth there were no religions. They did not understand how the Universe worked, but they wanted to try to understand it, so \"god' was invented. Every time there was a thunderstorm and lightning stuck they felt that \"God\" must be angry about \"something\". Remember, back in the beginning of time mankind was not educated about anything. Of course today we are more educated, and we understand that an 'angry God' didn't cause lightning, but way back in the beginning of time mankind simply did not have this knowledge, and so they quickly became superstitious about this powerful \"God\". All that those cavemen cared about was finding their next meal. They did not have a supermarket down the street, or a McDonalds down the road - hell, they didn't even invent roads yet - they were just trying to stay alive. Where do you think the ritual of praying before eating a meal came from? It came from cavemen like these who were literally thanking this 'thunder God' for suppling them with their food for the day. From that point on they started to collect stories about this \"God\" and soon they had developed entire myths - stories that they had passed down to younger generations to TEACH THEM how to survive with this \"God\". Over time these myths became more sophisticated, and from those more developed myths came the first primitive religions.",
