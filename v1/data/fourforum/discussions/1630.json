Since humans have no purpose for existance there is no rational justification for adopting an objectively moral (right, wrong, good , bad, ought, worth, and so forth) point of view. With this logic a nihilist could not disagree, or agree with any moral issue, because they dont exist, except for subjectively and vary from person to person. So, you will never see a rational nihilist who adopts this point of view, protesting against anything (i.e. torturing of babies, suicide, mass murder)\n \n Private egoism (the view that I will do right if and only if it is in my own intersts to do so) is the only motivation for a nihilist to be moral. This is to say that if I find moral life to be satifying or if doing what society says is moral will help me enjoy my moment, then i will be motivated to be moral on occasion. Even this idea works against nihilism, becasue a nihilist cannot rationally recommend that others have a moral responsibility to be nihilist. At best they can only say if you find nihilism in your own best interest, then you might like to try nihilism. But nihilists may not even wish to do this, for it may not be in their own best interest for everyone to adopt nihilism.* A nihilist may have a more satisfying life if society itself adopts a moral point of view, since in that case others may continue to treat them  with respect when it is not in their own best interests. A nihilist may be happier if others do not adopt nihilism.\n \n So in light of the nihilism, it appears that a veiw which bases value exclusivly on subjective satisfaction runs into to many problems to be logical. So there must be a higher giver of value than humans.\n \n * A similar argument is sometimes raised against various forms of utilitarianism, especially act utilitariansim. It may be the case that more utility is produced if people do not belive utilitariansism, an odd result for a moral theory if there ever was one.",

So sumed up I am saying Empirical value is not subject to personal attribution of quality assesment so how does it not have a value attached to it in a purly external way (such as being green, blue, red, orange etc.)\n\n \n Before I begin to clairfy my last post I need spell out the distintion between a property and a substance. A property is an entity: redness, hardness, triangularity, painfulness, or value. A property has atleast four characteristics which distinguissh it form a substance. First, a property is a universal, not a particualr. It can be in more than one thing or at more than one place at the same time. Second, a property is immutable and does not contain opposites (hot and cold, red and green) within it. When a leaf goes from green to red, the leaf changes. Greeness does not become redness. Greenness and redness remain the same. Third, properties can be had by something else. They can be in another thing which has them. Redness is in an apple. The apple has the redness. Fourth, properties do not have casual power. They do not act as efficient causes. Properties are not agents which act on other agents in the world.\n \n A substance is an entity like an apple, my dog Fido, a carbon atom, a leaf, or an angle. Substances contrast with properties in the four characteristics listed. First, substances are particulars. For example, my dog Fido cannot be in more than one place at one time. Second, a substance can change and have opposites. A leaf can go from green to red or hot to cold by gaining or losing properties. During the process of change, the substance gains and loses properties, but it is still the same substance. The same leaf that was green is now red. Third, substances are basic, fundamental existents. They are not in other things or had by other things. Rather, Fido has properties. Fido is a unity of properties (dogness, browness, shape, value), parts (paws, teeth, ears), and dispositions or capacities (law-like tendencies to realize certain properties in the process of growth if certain conditions obtain; for instance the capacity to grow teeth is the fetus is norished). They are all united into the substance Fido and possessed by him. Finally, a substance has casual powers. It can act as a casual agent in the world. A carbon atom can act on another atom. A dog can bark or pick up a bone. A leaf can hit the ground.\n \n Now with that in mind\n \n I just read over my last post after reading your post draconis, and realized I was not clear on the distinction between the degree of value in a substance (i.e (x) costs $5 or $10), versus the existance of value as a propery. \n \n \n \n \n \n So only imbued human personification onto objects or other humans creates value in a relitive arena?\n \n No, i do not agree with that statement. \n \n Imbued human personification onto substances determines the degree of value (in terms of worth) in a realative (subjective) arena, but does not create the property of value in a substance(in terms of worth). I used nihilism as an example to illustrate how illogical and contradictory the belief that human subjectivness is the way by which substance gets the property of value. And I concluded that the degree of value is subjectively relative (not in the inherent goal), but value is inherent with existance, and it is not given by humans. That is to say if substances exist rahter than not exist, they inherently contain the property of value. And this is because existance as a whole has an intrinsic purpose to work toward an inherent goal. And this goal is to glorify God and to promote the good of God's creatures, especially man (who is has the highest degree of value). \n \n (so that is the meaning of life!)\n \n Now to answer you second question.\n \n So sumed up I am saying Empirical value is not subject to personal attribution of quality assesment\n \n I agree with you. Substance ( a star) has properties about it (1,000,000 degrees) which are empiracle.\n \n I hope I cleared myself up",

   "Ok, but first can we us words I understand. Such as characteristics (dogness) and matter (the dog). \n \n Now matter (the dog) can only have its value attained through a survey of its characteristics, and that is how we arrive at relative value. The dog may have dogness, but without examining its characteristics to determine if it fits into the category of a dog, we must simply state it has empirical qualities of height-1.0 meters, weight 50 grams, and teeth length of 5 centimetres. Now the value of the dog is given already, but if we wish to ascribe worth to the dog, we must transcend the state of matter/characteristics field into your argument. Worth is most likely what you are describing, because a star will always be a star. It is as you say a substance, but no matter what people call it, it will always have the value of a star because unlike your dog, stars are a set standard. They can come in different sizes, shapes, colours and ages but a star will always have the basic qualifications of being a star. The star has the set value of being 1,000,000 degrees, being variably 100,000,000,000 kilometres across, and being of a certain age. The star&#8217;s worth in the eyes of the peoples looking at the star may be low if the star is going to expand and kill them, or high if the star is going to save their planet. Of course I could be wrong, but aren&#8217;t values something outside our conception and do not require our interpretation, while, on the opposite note, isn&#8217;t something&#8217;s worth highly subjective (as you perfectly said), and different depending on who you ask?",

   "aren't values something outside our conception and do not require our interpretation\n \n I really dont know what you mean by value here\n \n isn't something's worth highly subjective  \n \n Like I said in my last post. Somthings DEGREE  of worth is subjective, but the CREATION of worth is not subjective. The reason I come to this conclusion is that somethings worth is inherent with a purpose. And when things exist their inherent purpose is to glorify God, and to promote the good of God's creatures (especially man, who God gives the highest degree of value). So existance's ultimate inherent purpose is objective, which means worth towards that inherent purpose is objective.\n \n So God created everything for the purpose of glorifying him. And since everything with a purpose has worth, and since God is forever, nothing in existance will ever cease to have worth. \n \n If you have an objection about God, you can read back on my last post to see the contradictory view of nihilism. It isnt the only alternative view, but the same arguments made against nihilism holds true for many of the other major veiws which believes that existance has no meaning and purpose.",

Cause if thats what your talking about I have to completely agree.\n \n Simply put...Yes, but ethically im a deontologist. I beleive the ends do not justify the means. And it basically boils down to intentions in most cases. For example you used someone putting down a land-mine a thousand years before it killed an evil dictator.The person who put it down had no intentions of it doing what it did (killing an evil dictator a thousand yrs later). So if the person setting the land-mine had evil intentions, I dont believe the dead evil dictator justified it being set. But, if the intentions were good, and just, I would go a step further , and say that the land-mine had the purpose to kill the evil dictator at the begining of time. God created the univerese and everything in it, and some of thoes things in the world were parts that made the land-mine, and their purpose was to be constructed into a land-mine to kill the evil dictator.\n \n So I would argue that argument for God legitimizes my belief that worth is inherent with existance.",

   "\n Purpose gives a person value just it gives anything else value. But human subjecitve satifaction is not the giver of human value. I touched on the issue, but ill elaborate why sheer human subjective satisfaction doesnt give humans value. \n \n Value (not the degree of value, but the fact that something/someone has any worth at all) is determined by purpose. If you remember I said Value is inherent when there is purpose for (x). When (x) ceases to have a purpose, it inherently ceases to have value. And we all agreed to thoes terms on the basis of subjective satisfaction. But if subjectively, humans are the only ones who determine worth, then on many occassions you would find that people would have no value/worth/purpose because they are not found subjectively satisfing by any other humans. At the same time it would not be wrong for someone to commit suicide if they deemed themself without purpose.\n\n this is all well and good, but remember *purpose* in an d of itself is still subjective. to a daughter a policeman may be a a father, provider and hero. to a drug-dealer that same policeman may be an obstacle to his financial success. the role/purpose of a human varies from perspective to perspective, and so does his value. the same is true from non-human things",

I enjoy my life, and not having a cosmic purpose for my existance does not reduce my enjoyment of it.\n\n \n You are quite correct in that we seem at an impasse. I don't doubt that your beliefs even add to your enjoyment of life. However, I am 37 and have lived only a bit longer. However, there will come a point in your future where you will want more than to merely enjoy your life. You will want to contribute to the life of another. That is where this all really comes into play. It is quite difficult to live with another person and simply live by the principle, I won't hurt you if you won't hurt me. I know from experience that this does not work. Anytime two people move towards greater intimacy they will hurt each other. The question is, can you commit to work for the best of someone who hurt you and will continue to hurt you. They will also love you and continue to love you.\n \n Jesus said, Love the lord your god with all your heart mind strength and soul and love your neighbor as yourself. Not merely, don't hurt them, but rather actively love them. That is difficult from your philosophy. But as we said we will not likely convince each other. I do wish you well in your endeavors. Keep an open mind and seek for what is true and you will find it.",
