   "Fellow vets, this is for you.\n \n John Griggs\n \n \n Subject: Information you need to read before you choose.\n FORMER GREEN BERET TACKLES KERRY AGAIN!\n \n Thank you, John Kerry, for helping make us Vietnam veterans war heroes \n now, but you also were the primary reason that the American public \n grabbed sturdy unbending brooms of judgment and swept us into the closet\n \n of silence and shame for so many years. Now, with your latest unreported\n \n insanity, you are getting ready for our society to grab those same stiff\n \n brooms and sweep our brave, noble young men and women fighting against \n the War on Terror in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, into that cold, \n dark cell of heartbreak and betrayal, like we Vietnam veterans had to \n endure in silent dignity. I cannot and will not watch this country go \n through that again.\n \n The hardcore America-hating, Israel-hating, jihad-spouting Muslim \n clerics in the mideast are very excited and passing around a front page \n newspaper story from the very anti-American TEHRAN TIMES in Iran. In the\n \n country that is home of the world's toughest theocratic dictatorship, an\n \n e-mail from Democratic Presidential nominee, you, John Forbes Kerry, \n sent to the paper by your campaign committee, although they deny sending\n \n it, was printed word-for-word on the front page of Iran's main \n newspaper. Your message states emphatically that, if elected President, \n you, John Kerry plan to, within 100 days, not only end the War on \n Terror, but travel to the mideast and elsewhere and apologize for our \n actions and the actions of President Bush in the War on Terror. It says \n that you plan to apologize to friends and foes alike. That is right, \n folks. John Kerry will say he is sorry, and in his mind, all those jihad\n \n extremists, who have vowed to kill all Americans wherever we are, will \n simply forgive us, hold hands with Kerry, start singing \"Kumbaya,\" and \n all will be right in the world. This is insane!\n \n \n Senior writer Kenneth R. Timmerman in the March 1st edition of INSIGHT, \n tells about the massive campaign contributions to the \n Kerry-for-President campaign by three Iranian businessmen living in the \n US, who are lobbying for the US lifting of sanctions on Iran and \n accepting the anti-Christian, anti-Jewish, anti-American Tehran regime \n and the close ties of one to the chairman of Mobil Oil.\n \n Pro-democracy dissidents in Iran are shocked and appalled at your \n remarks, and have reported that in Iran and other Mideastern countries, \n that all the extremists and anti-west mullahs who strongly supported the\n \n attacks on the World Trade Center, Pentagon, USS Cole, Marine Barracks, \n and anyplace Americans congregate, want you to become our President, but\n \n they are scared to death of George W. Bush. Just think, The Democratic \n candidate for President, you, John Forbes Kerry, is endorsed by the Al \n Q'Aida, Hezbollah, PLF, and Hamas.\n \n But on February 27, 2004, in a speech at UCLA , you, while trying to \n talk tough, despite voting against all major weapons systems for the \n past 18 years, stated that you will continue the War on Terror, but \n would use our police forces, and especially those in foreign countries, \n and you would also put our troops back under the powder blue flag of the\n \n United Nations. You recently made comments about Bush making troops \n fight without Kevlar vests, but you, Senator Kerry, voted against buying\n \n them while you were in the Senate.\n \n Like the Kama Sutra, Senator, you change positions constantly. You're \n not going to end the War on Terror, but instead use police to handcuff \n terrorists and read them their rights; then a week later, you are going \n to end the War on Terrorism and apologize to everyone we have offended, \n such as Iran. What is it going be next week, Kerry? You flip-flop more \n than a beached tuna on steroids.\n \n You convinced TV reporters Chris Wallace on Fox and NBC's Tim Russert \n that a photograph circulating the web and news showing you a few rows \n away from Jane Fonda at a September, 1970 Anti-War Rally at Valley \n Forge, was simply a coincidence and that you and Hanoi Jane barely knew \n each other. But, in fact, Senator, there were only 8 speakers that day,\n \n including Fonda, Donald Southerland, and Bella Abzug, and Hanoi Jane \n funded that rally, and the keynote speaker was you, John Forbes Kerry, \n executive committee member of Vietnam Veterans Against the War.\n \n We must be Americans first, and think about our political parties after \n that. Sometimes we lose sight of that. I have six grown children and two\n \n are democrats. I voted for Jimmy Carter. This is not about politics. It \n is about standing up to the ultimate playground bully, and not simply \n cowering and kissing his shoes.\n \n I left it \"all on the field\" in the jungles back there when I was \n medevaced out of Vietnam in March of 1969 and sent back to hospitals in \n \"The World.\" Although You, Mr. Kerry, painted all of us Vietnam veterans\n \n with the yellow brush of My Lai and Tiger Force, most of us, draftees \n and lifers alike, actually poured our hearts out in the tropical rain \n forests and in the rice paddies, thoroughly gave it our all, and acted \n as warriors who had honor. I have a son earning his green beret at Fort \n Bragg right now and a daughter-in-law on orders for Iraq. I am not going\n \n to stand by and watch them go through the same treatment we did, because\n \n some of our well-meaning fellow Americans choose to wear blinders and \n believe things just because they heard it on the network news or simply \n not care enough to get involved.\n \n I am not a \"baby-killer, torturer, or murderer,\" John Kerry. I am a \n Vietnam veteran and an American who will not soon forget, or ever want \n to see again, any more jets loaded with fuel and screaming, innocent \n Americans slamming into our buildings on our very own soil. I have shed \n enough tears for ten lifetimes. We all have. I will never again let my \n fellow countrymen get away with making American veterans feel like \n bastard step-children.\n \n Santayana said, \"Those who do not remember the past are condemned to \n repeat it.\"\n \n John Kerry, I now call on my \"Band of Brothers,\" those who have heard \n the sound of guns and cries of orphaned children, those who hate war \n more than anyone who has not been there, to join me in this difficult \n battle ahead. Republicans, democrats, independents, and the apolitical, \n I call on the\n 25,000,000 veterans of this country to help me confront this evil facing\n \n our great nation, not with guns and bombs, but with our voices, our \n votes, our computers, and with all our fighting spirit.\n \n My fellow veterans, your families, survivors, and neighbors: God bless \n you and God bless America.\n \n You want proof of all I have to say.
