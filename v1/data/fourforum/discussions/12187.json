   "VATICAN CITY (AFP) &#8212; The contraceptive pill is polluting the environment and is in part responsible for male infertility, a report in the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano said Saturday.\n \n The pill \"has for some years had devastating effects on the environment by releasing tonnes of hormones into nature\" through female urine, said Pedro Jose Maria Simon Castellvi, president of the International Federation of Catholic Medical Associations, in the report.\n \n more: use google news search (words: pope & pill)\n \n \n I have one question: where should I post this thread?\n \"Religion Debates\" or \"Fun Debates\"?\n \n IMO Vatican People simply hate the word \"sex\". \n That's all.",
