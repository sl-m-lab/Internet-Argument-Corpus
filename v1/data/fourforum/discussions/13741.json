And they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched, and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.\"\n \n Select Sermons | Christian Classics Ethereal Library\n \n From a prior post: Isaiah call the Jews \"Sodomites;\" Jeremiah likens them to \"a wild XXX in heat;\" Ezekiel and Hosea classify them as \"adultresses;\" and Amos likens them to a \"father and son who use the same girl.\" \n \n And the Lord said to Moses, \"I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people; now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them [Exod. 32: 9-10].\n \n Elsewhere in the Bible, God wiped out everyone except Noah and his family; he destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah; Jericho; a great number of the Exodus people, and numerous men and nations throughout the OT.\n \n \"You are destroyed, O Israel, because you are against me, against your helper. Hosea 13:9\n \n Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt. - Daniel 12:2\n \n And these are all sons and daughters of God?

This external guarantee is the sufficient, universal, and ordinary proof of inspiration. The unique quality of the Sacred Books is a revealed dogma. Moreover, by its very nature inspiration eludes human observation and is not self-evident, being essentially superphysical and supernatural. Its sole absolute criterion, therefore, is the Holy inspiring Spirit, witnessing decisively to Itself, not in the subjective experience of individual souls, as Calvin maintained, neither in the doctrinal and spiritual tenor of Holy Writ itself, according to Luther, but through the constituted organ and custodian of Its revelations, the Church. All other evidences fall short of the certainty and finality necessary to compel the absolute assent of faith. (See Franzelin, \"De Divin\u00e2 Traditione et Scriptur\u00e2\"; Wiseman, \"Lectures on Christian Doctrine\", Lecture ii; also INSPIRATION.)\n \n This is from Ireneus and this is an example of some methods used to determine the Bible. Strange that for someone so assured he would be going UP to Heaven and heretics would be going DOWN to hell that niether of those are considered directions.\n \n It is not possible that the gospels can be either more or fewer in number than they are, since there are four directions of the world in which we live, and there are four principal winds. (adv. Haer. 3.11.8)\n \n \nNow, why don't you start showing us your wisdom by refuting the resurrection?? No one in 2,000 years has been able to do it.\n\n \n The resurrection cannot be proven without doubt as being true or false.

These claims are made based on the assumption of what they believe the bible is supposed to say.

They destroyed everything else, so of course the differences should be within reason, but they aren't. \n \n One big issue is they didn't get together to decide until approximatly 300 years after Jesus died.

The book of Acts speaks of his conversion in Acts 9. Since Acts was written before 70 A.D. and Paul wrote the Pauline Epistles and we know that Paul died in 64 A.D., the Pauline Epistles were all written before that date. Furthermore, in 1 Cor. 15:3-4 is an early creed of the Christian church where Paul mentions that Jesus had died and risen. \"For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,\" (1 Cor. 15:3-4).

   "I don't have people from ages ago to question about what they might have believed or not believed. But here's a fulfilled prophecy from the Bible.\n \n The Rebirth of Israel\n\n \n How very Christian, but why do they think Leviticus is years?\n Leviticus 26 is it a Time Prophecy \n \n \n Biblical Prophecy: Israel to be Restored as an Independent Nation in 1948\n \n \nThey had the Word of God, the prophets, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. They weren't thrashing around in the dark like secular humanists.\n\n \n No, not like secular humanists, but thrashing about they were. No Jesus had been dead for a long time, same with any prophets, the Word of God was what they were trying to figure out and the Holy Spirit in this case is the same as crossing your fingers.\n \n \nThe scholars I referenced say otherwise. They base their research on many things, including verbiage, type of instruments used, historical references, etc., etc. Here's some info that adds to the early dates they referenced.\n \n When were the Gospels Written, and by whom?\n \n When were the gospels written and by whom? | Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry\n \n When was the Book of Acts Written?\n \n When was the book of Acts written? | Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry\n \n Eatra-biblical references to the NT:\n \n Non-biblical accounts of New Testament events and/or people | Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry\n \n Wasn't the New Testament written hundreds of years after Christ?\n \n Paul the Apostle was a convert to Christianity. The book of Acts speaks of his conversion in Acts 9. Since Acts was written before 70 A.D. and Paul wrote the Pauline Epistles and we know that Paul died in 64 A.D., the Pauline Epistles were all written before that date. Furthermore, in 1 Cor. 15:3-4 is an early creed of the Christian church where Paul mentions that Jesus had died and risen. \"For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,\" (1 Cor. 15:3-4). Notice that he says he received this information. From whom did he receive it? Most probably the apostles since he had a lot of interaction with them. This means that Paul received the gospel account from the eyewitnesses. They were, of course contemporaries; they all died before the turn of the century. Therefore, their writings were completed within the lifetime of the apostles of Jesus.\n Wasn't the New Testament written hundreds of years after Christ? | Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry\n \n That's one of the reasons why many scholars date Acts in the 50's to 62 AD.\n\n \n Wow, that was a complete waste of everybody's time. Do you think you can respond to the questions posed next time? When the books of the NT were written isn't really relevant to this specific discussion. \n \n When they were written doesn't answer\n Are originals known to currently exist?\n At the time the bible was canonized were the originals present?\n If so were they known without any doubt as such?\n When Christians claim the NT can be reconstructed based on thrid party writings, what do they compare to confirm that?\n To recreate the NT from 3rd party authors, what is the earliest and who is the last or what is the span of time between the writings of the 1st to the last author.\n How many verses are left out even then?\n \n Why do believe scholars using the earliest dates over the scholars thinking much later dates?\n \n \nNo, you haven't made your case. See above for a daggar in the heart of that viewpoint.\n\n \n Dagger to the heart.... of the wrong person. So if as you claim prophecy is indeed valid and may be taken from scripture, then you have no problem with the prophetic verses showing the Messiah could be a rooster. \n \n Hindsight is 20/20 as they say. With a pool of verses to choose from the size of the OT and there being almost no criteria for what could be viewed as prophecy almost anybody could be considered the Messiah.\n \n Before you go off and ask to name someone, how do you know that all the verses you claim concern Jesus actually do? How do you know the Messiah hasn't come yet? Why do you include Daniel and Psalms as having verses fulfilled by Jesus?\n \n \nYou've made claims. They haven't held up to close scrutiny.\n\n \n What scrutiny? You respond with unrelated posts as much as related. The only consistancy is that they typically are made based on the assumtpion of Jesus and then presented to conform to the desired conclusion. You have not shown the ability to even grasp half of what I have said let alone refute it.\n \n \nDid you ever come up with anything that disproves the resurrection? Not theories or what if's, but anything compelling? THAT'S PROBABLY THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE ANY HEADWAY AROUND HERE.\n\n \n Yes I did. It was far more compelling than the arguments you came up with \n Because\n LA LA LA LA LA LA\n and \n the Bible says so\n \n Do you have anything compelling to confirm your BELIEF something that cannot be disputed, that can confirm your FAITH? No you can't otherwise we would not be having this conversation. Nor would you be having it with anybody else. \n \n \nPeople, LIKE YOU, have been trying to discredit Christ and the Bible for 2,000 years. They die and the Word lives on. You think you're making any headway? LOL! If there were anything that could strike Christianity dead it would have already hit CNN, FOX, MSNBC, etc. It hasn't, and you don't have squat. You haven't even researched most of what you think is bogus. Greater minds than yours have tried to bust the NT, and many have become believers instead. That might be a goal for you in 2010.\n\n \n I know it often isn't Christian, but let's be fair. Christians have had 2000 years to come up with the arguments for Christianity. Re-writing, destroying and and subverting anything contrary. Based on the admitted behavior of the early church do you really think there is documentation still around that could topple Christianity? Of course you see no connection between the formation of the Canon and the inability to find any text of the NT prior to that. \n \n Go do some research on the criteria used to select the Canon and which made it and which didn't and try not to put your biased spin on it, understanding only what you want to understand and then come back to me with your inspired word mumbo jumbo.\n \n \n JESUS IS LORD![/QUOTE]",

I can either show it to be incorrect, partially or in it's entirety through fact and/or the application of common rational sense. \n \n If you start with the supposition that God is Omnipotent, Omniscient, and benevolent and apply that to the Bible then whatever doesn't conform is not from God. \n \n It makes no sense for one of the 10 commandments to be Thou shalt not kill( actually should be murder) after commanding the Jews to commit Genocide. More than once, completely erase their existence from the world, every man, woman and child, cut down their groves, throw away gold and silver from their holy places. No talking to, no agreements with and no mercy towards.\n \n Christianity repeats certain themes often. One of the most stated is of glorifying God. God needs no validation from mankind, nor anything else man thinks is important. How arrogant to think that God requires your acknowledgement in order to feel happy or complete or secure or whatever is accomplished by repitiously praising him. \n \n With that in mind another frequent theme is \n \n Leviticus 19:18 'You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the sons of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself; I am the LORD.\n \n Matthew 7:12 \"In everything, therefore, treat people the same way you want them to treat you, for this is the Law and the Prophets.\n \n Matthew 19:19 HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER; and YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.\"\n \n Matthew 22:39-40 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself \"On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets.\"\n \n John 13:34 \"A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.\n \n Romans 13:8 Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.\n \n Romans 13:10 Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.\n \n \n What would a God of the first statement get from sacrifice or suffering or denial of being or meaningless ceremony or buildings or anything else that Christians say are necessary. We can however co-exist with the whole of God's creation in a manner that would show that we are made in the image of God. \n \n God is portrayed as a parent and most parents primary goal is to raise kids who are successful. Not necessarily financially, but socially, intellectually and are responsible and self sufficient. Those are things that reflect good parenting and therefore glorify God.\n \n So I may indeed be clueless or this is all just meaningless drivel, but it makes sense to me and until you can come up with something worthwhile that is contrary, I am going to stick to it.",
