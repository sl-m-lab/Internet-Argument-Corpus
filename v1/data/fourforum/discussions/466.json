   "To Sakata on 05-30-2003\n Is anything more than faith needed in order to gain salvation?\n Eph. 2:8, 9, RS: \"By grace [\"undeserved kindness,\" NW] you have been saved through faith; and this is not your own doing, it is the gift of God-not because of works, lest any man should boast.\" (The entire provision for salvation is an expression of God's undeserved kindness. There is no way that a descendant of Adam can gain salvation on his own, no matter how noble his works are. Salvation is a gift from God given to those who put faith in the sin-atoning value of the sacrifice of his Son.)\n Heb. 5:9, RS: \"He [Jesus] became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him.\" (Italics added.) (Does this conflict with the statement that Christians are \"saved through faith\"? Not at all. Obedience simply demonstrates that their faith is genuine.)\n Jas. 2:14, 26, RS: \"What does it profit, my brethren, if a man says he has faith but has not works? Can his faith save him? For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so faith apart from works is dead.\" (A person does not earn salvation by his works. But anyone who has genuine faith will have works to go with it-works of obedience to the commands of God and Christ, works that demonstrate his faith and love. Without such works, his faith is dead.)\n Acts 16:30, 31, RS: \"'Men, what must I do to be saved?' And they [Paul and Silas] said, 'Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.'\" (If that man and his household truly believed, would they not act in harmony with their belief? Certainly.)\n \n So then what are the works that demonstrate true faith?",
