   "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/02/opinion/02krugman.html\n \n\n Before 9/11 the Federal Emergency Management Agency listed the three most likely catastrophic disasters facing America: a terrorist attack on New York, a major earthquake in San Francisco and a hurricane strike on New Orleans. \"The New Orleans hurricane scenario,\" The Houston Chronicle wrote in December 2001, \"may be the deadliest of all.\" It described a potential catastrophe very much like the one now happening.\n \n So why were New Orleans and the nation so unprepared? After 9/11, hard questions were deferred in the name of national unity, then buried under a thick coat of whitewash. This time, we need accountability.\n \n First question: Why have aid and security taken so long to arrive? Katrina hit five days ago - and it was already clear by last Friday that Katrina could do immense damage along the Gulf Coast. Yet the response you'd expect from an advanced country never happened. Thousands of Americans are dead or dying, not because they refused to evacuate, but because they were too poor or too sick to get out without help - and help wasn't provided. Many have yet to receive any help at all.\n \n There will and should be many questions about the response of state and local governments; in particular, couldn't they have done more to help the poor and sick escape? But the evidence points, above all, to a stunning lack of both preparation and urgency in the federal government's response.\n \n Even military resources in the right place weren't ordered into action. \"On Wednesday,\" said an editorial in The Sun Herald in Biloxi, Miss., \"reporters listening to horrific stories of death and survival at the Biloxi Junior High School shelter looked north across Irish Hill Road and saw Air Force personnel playing basketball and performing calisthenics. Playing basketball and performing calisthenics!\"\n\n \n Interestingly at the bottom of the page:\n \nThomas L. Friedman is on vacation.\n\n \n http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/09/who_are_you_goi.html\n \n\n Who Are You Going to Believe, Me or Your Lying Eyes?\n \n Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff claims that food and water are being provided to refugee concentrations, and that Oceania has always been at war with Eurasia:\n \n Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff today on NPR's All Things Considered:\n \n Robert Siegel: We are hearing from our reporter, he's on another line right now, thousands of people at the convention center in New Orleans with no food, zero.\n \n Chertoff: As I said, I'm telling you we are getting food and water to areas where people are staging. The one about an episode like this is if you talk to someone or you get a rumor or an anecdotal version of something I think it's dangerous to extrapolate it all over the place.\n \n [Snip]\n \n Robert Siegel: But Mr. Secretary when you say we shouldn't listen to rumors. These are things coming from reporters who have not only covered many many other hurricanes, they've covered wars and refugee camps. These aren't rumors, they are saying there are thousands of people there.\n \n Chertoff: I would be--I have not heard a report of thousands of people in the convention center who don't have food and water.\n\n \n THIS IS THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY who only had to switch on a TV to see what he says he never saw.",

Mike Brown fired from prior job at Horse Assoc.\n by Goldy at HorsesAss\n Fri Sep 2nd, 2005 at 00:46:22 PDT\n \n [editor's note, by Goldy at HorsesAss] Revised title\n \n \"An unmitigated, total ****ing disaster.\" That's not a quote from Mike Brown, but rather, a quote describing him. And most disturbingly, it's not even a reference to his dismal performance as director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). This blunt critique was emailed to me from a regular reader who was apparently attracted to HorsesAss.org by her passion for politics and her love of Arabian horses.\n \n I think I've told you that I'm into Arab horses. Well, for 3 years Michael Brown was hired and then fired by our IAHA, the International Arabian Horse Assoc. He was an unmitigated, total ****ing disaster. I was shocked as hell when captain clueless put him in charge of FEMA a couple of years ago.\n \n * Goldy at HorsesAss's diary :: ::\n *\n \n He or the WH lied on the WH presser announcing him to FEMA. IAHA was never connected to the Olympic Comm, only the half Arab registry then and the governing body to the state and local Arabian horse clubs. He ruined IAHA financially so badly that we had to change the name and combine it with the Purebred registry.\n \n I am telling you this after watching the ****ing shipwreck in the Gulf. His incompetence is KILLING people.\n \n Yes, that's right... the man responsible for directing federal relief operations in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, sharpened his emergency management skills as the \"Judges and Stewards Commissioner\" for the International Arabian Horses Association... a position from which he was forced to resign in the face of mounting litigation and financial disarray.\n \n And what of that misleading White House press release?\n \n From 1991 to 2001, Brown was the Commissioner of the International Arabian Horse Association, an international subsidiary of the national governing organization of the U.S. Olympic Committee.\n \n I can't even begin to fact check the dates or IAHA's alleged relationship to the US Olympic Committee, because of course, the IAHA doesn't exist anymore, so there's nothing to Google. But it begs the question... how the hell did his prior job experience prepare Brown to head FEMA?\n \n Well, judging by his agency's performance over the past few days... it didn't.\n \n [Cross-posted at HorsesAss.org] \n",

   "http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20050902/ts_nm/weather_katrina_criticism_dc\n \n \nModels predicted New Orleans disaster, experts say\n \n \n \n By Alan Elsner Fri Sep 2,11:54 AM ET\n \n WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Virtually everything that has happened in New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina struck was predicted by experts and in computer models, so emergency management specialists wonder why authorities were so unprepared. \n \n \"The scenario of a major hurricane hitting New Orleans was well anticipated, predicted and drilled around,\" said Clare Rubin, an emergency management consultant who also teaches at the Institute for Crisis, Disaster, and Risk Management at George Washington University.\n \n Computer models developed at Louisiana State University and other institutions made detailed projections of what would happen if water flowed over the levees protecting the city or if they failed.\n \n In July 2004, more than 40 federal, state, local and volunteer organizations practiced this very scenario in a five-day simulation code-named \"Hurricane Pam,\" where they had to deal with an imaginary storm that destroyed over half a million buildings in New Orleans and forced the evacuation of a million residents.\n \n At the end of the exercise Ron Castleman, regional director for the\n Federal Emergency Management Agency declared: \"We made great progress this week in our preparedness efforts.\n \n \"Disaster response teams developed action plans in critical areas such as search and rescue, medical care, sheltering, temporary housing, school restoration and debris management. These plans are essential for quick response to a hurricane but will also help in other emergencies,\" he said.\n \n In light of that, said disaster expert Bill Waugh of Georgia State University, \"It's inexplicable how unprepared for the flooding they were.\" He said a slow decline over several years in funding for emergency management was partly to blame.\n \n In comments on Thursday,\n President George W. Bush said, \"I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees.\"\n \n But Louisiana State University engineer Joseph Suhayda and others have warned for years that defenses could fail. In 2002, the New Orleans Times Picayune published a five-part series on \"The Big One\" examining what might happen if they did.\n \n SCENARIO LAID OUT\n \n It predicted that 200,000 people or more would be unwilling or unable to heed evacuation orders and thousands would die, that people would be housed in the Superdome, that aid workers would find it difficult to gain access to the city as roads became impassable, as well as many other of the consequences that actually unfolded after Katrina hit this week.\n \n Craig Marks who runs Blue Horizons Consulting, an emergency management training company in North Carolina, said the authorities had mishandled the evacuation, neglecting to help those without transportation to leave the city.\n \n \"They could have packed people on trains or buses and gotten them out before the hurricane struck. They had enough time and access to federal funds. And now, we find we do not have a proper emergency communications infrastructure so aid workers get out into the field and they can't talk to one another,\" he said.\n \n Most of those trapped by the floods in the city of some 500,000 people are the poor who had little chance to leave.\n \n Ernest Sternberg, a professor of urban and regional planning at the University of Buffalo, said law enforcement agencies were often more eager to invest in high tech \"toys\" than basic communications.\n \n \"It's well known that communications go down in disasters but people on the frontlines still don't invest in them. A lot of the investments that have been made in homeland security have been misspent,\" he said.\n \n Several experts also believe the decision to make FEMA a part of the Department of\n Homeland Security, created after the September 11, 2001 attacks, was a major mistake. Rubin said FEMA functioned well in the 1990s as a small, independent agency.\n \n \"Under DHS, it was downgraded, buried in a couple of layers of bureaucracy, and terrorism prevention got all the attention and most of the funds,\" she said.\n \n Former FEMA director James Lee Witt testified to Congress in March 2004: \"I am extremely concerned that the ability of our nation to prepare for and respond to disasters has been sharply eroded.\n \n \"I hear from emergency managers, local and state leaders, and first responders nearly every day that the FEMA they knew and worked well with has now disappeared. In fact one state emergency manager told me, 'It is like a stake has been driven into the heart of emergency management,\"' he said.\n \n Underlying the situation has been the general reluctance of government at any level to invest in infrastructure or emergency management, said David McEntire, who teaches emergency management at the University of North Texas.\n \n \"No-one cares about disasters until they happen. That is a political fact of life,\" he said.\n \n \"Emergency management is woefully underfunded in this nation. That covers not only first responders but also warning, evacuation, damage assessment, volunteer management, donation management and recovery and mitigation issues,\" he said. \n",

Good.\n \n And while I'm pleased to see Congress respond, I can't help but notice that Speaker Hastert's office seems a little confused.\n \n Just 48 hours ago, Roll Call reported that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi urged Speaker Dennis Hastert to have a special session to appropriate relief to the victims of Hurricane Katrina, but the Speaker's office said it didn't plan to hold a vote this week because FEMA has things under control.\n \n [Hastert spokesman Ron] Bonjean said calling Members back to town this week is not the best course of action.\n \n \"There is a humanitarian rescue operation going on right now, as we speak,\" Bonjean said. \"It is difficult to get a real assessment on the amount of damage done, which makes a special session unlikely. In addition, emergency relief services such as FEMA have billions of dollars at hand to help with the initial relief.\"\n \n Last night, however, Roll Call reported that Hastert's office has not only embraced Pelosi's idea, they now want credit for the whole thing.\n \n Ron Bonjean, a spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.), said the GOP Congressional leadership is committed to helping the victims in the Gulf region.\n \n \"We've approached the Minority Leader [Pelosi] with a proposal to bring the House back into emergency session to pass emergency funding for Hurricane Katrina victims,\" Bonjean said.\n \n What was that about not playing politics with the disaster? On Wednesday, Hastert's office is rebuffing Pelosi's idea for an emergency bill. On Thursday, Hastert's office is saying it was their idea all along.\n \n Ultimately, the credit for a good thing doesn't matter and I'm just glad the money is on its way to FEMA. But Bonjean's attempt to spin this seems unusually callous.\n",

   "http://nightlight.typepad.com/nightlight/2005/09/dont_hide_behin.html\n \n \nbe patient, the drowning are told\n \n Condoleezza Rice took a break today from her round of Broadway shows and a shoe-buying spree that would do Imelda Marcos proud. Why? To tell the hurricane victims dying hourly in their homes that their prolonged suffering is God's will, not the government's fault, and to lecture them on the virtue of patience:\n \n Asked to say a few words from the pulpit, Rice, a preacher's daughter, said: \"The Lord Jesus Christ is going to come on time.\" She added: \"If we just wait.\"\n \n Earlier at the same church service \"Rice nodded in agreement as the Rev. Malone Smith Jr. advised the congregation, \"Wait for the Lord.\" Rev. Smith and Secretary Rice were playing on the words of a beloved gospel hymn that says, \"He may not be there when you want him but he's right on time.\" They should both be ashamed of themselves.\n \n The blame is not God's, or nature's, or fate's, or that of statistical happenstance. Whatever your conception of a Higher Power may or may not be, the United States was given everything it needed to cope with this disaster better than it has. God was on time: it is Rice and her colleagues that were too late. And when human beings are dying, it's a sin to suggest that we - or anyone - \"wait.\"\n \n There's a joke popular among Christians that goes like this: \n \n A flood came and a man had to climb onto the roof of his house. As the waters rose a neighbor in a rowboat appeared, and told him to get in. \"No,\" replied the man on the roof, \"the Lord will save me.\" Then a firefighter appeared in a speedboat. \"Climb in!\" shouted the firefighter. \"No,\" replied the man on the roof, \"The Lord will save me.\" A helicopter appeared and the pilot shouted that he would lower a rope to the man on the roof. \"No,\" replied the man on the roof, \"the Lord will save me.\" Eventually the man drowned and went to heaven, where he asked God why He hadn't helped him. \"I sent a neighbor, a firefighter, and helicopter,\" said God. \"What more do you want?\"\n \n Here's what happened in the Gulf Coast this week: God sent America plenty of neighbors, but in that part of America they can't afford cars or public transportation, much less boats. And since there was no evacuation plan, the man and his neighbors were trapped. God gave America plenty of firefighters, but between budget cuts for first responders and the number of young people being drafted and sent to Iraq, there weren't any left to help this man in his time of need. God (and taxes) have given America many helicopters, but the ones that aren't in the Middle East weren't deployed quickly enough by the guitar-carrying President or his excuse-making underlings Chertoff and Brown. \n \n Somewhere, as I write, there is an American drowning while Condoleezza Rice and her boss suggest that he or she \"wait.\" That's not God's will, it's this Administration's. They should not hide behind God's skirts. And they should be ashamed of themselves for trying.\n\n \n Now they're going to blame God.\n \n But I have to disagree about their being no evacuation plan. Maybe they mean there was none for those without vehicles.\n \n \n \nCan we bash Bush with any more minutia? I hear he stepped on an ant last week, the callous murderer.\n\n It's just proof that Bush cares more about his agenda than he does about American citizens.",

Kathleen Babineaux Blanco (D). Shortly before midnight Friday, the Bush administration sent her a proposed legal memorandum asking her to request a federal takeover of the evacuation of New Orleans, a source within the state's emergency operations center said Saturday.\n \n The administration sought unified control over all local police and state National Guard units reporting to the governor. Louisiana officials rejected the request after talks throughout the night, concerned that such a move would be comparable to a federal declaration of martial law. Some officials in the state suspected a political motive behind the request. \"Quite frankly, if they'd been able to pull off taking it away from the locals, they then could have blamed everything on the locals,\" said the source, who does not have the authority to speak publicly.\n\n \n Even after knowing that she botched the evacuation, she still refused to let the Feds take control of the evacuation......AND YOU STILL BLAME BUSH?!!! emoticon_frazzled",

   "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/linkset/2005/04/11/LI2005041100879.html\n \n \nDealing With Political Disaster\n \n By Dan Froomkin\n Special to washingtonpost.com\n Tuesday, September 6, 2005; 1:21 PM\n \n President Bush somehow missed the significance of what was happening on the Gulf Coast last week as he and his political guru, Karl Rove, flitted between Texas and California and, finally, Washington.\n \n But now, facing what is clearly a full-scale political disaster, Rove and a handful of other masterful political operatives have gone into overdrive. They are back in campaign mode.\n \n This campaign is to salvage Bush's reputation.\n \n Like previous Rove operations, it calls for multiple appearances by the president in controlled environments in which he can appear leader-like. It calls for extensive use of Air Force One and a massive deployment of spinners.\n \n It doesn't necessarily include any change in policy. It certainly doesn't include any admission of error.\n \n It utilizes the classic Rovian tactic of attacking critics rather than defending against their criticism -- and of throwing up chaff to muddle the issue and throw the press off the scent.\n \n It calls for public expressions of outrage over the politicization of the issue and of those who would play the \"blame game.\" While at the same time, it is utterly political in nature and heavily reliant on shifting the blame elsewhere.\n \n But in some ways, this post-Katrina campaign poses Bush's aides with unprecedented challenges.\n \n The problem -- an achingly slow federal response to what has turned out to be one of the greatest natural disasters this country has ever faced -- can be traced at least in part to one of the Bush White House's most defining characteristics: The protective bubble within which the president operates.\n \n Bush's aides intentionally keep him mentally and physically aloof from any ugliness -- political or otherwise. It lets them keep tight control over the presidential imagery and stay on message.\n \n But inside his bubble, Bush first failed to recognize what was becoming clear to almost anyone watching the news: That Americans needed help. And in his two meticulously staged visits to the Gulf Coast on Friday and Monday, it is precisely because Bush was kept so far away from dissension or mess that he appeared so out of touch.\n \n He cracked jokes on Friday, including one about his drinking days in New Orleans, but has yet to confront the true horror of the situation so widely seen on TV. He has yet to acknowledge the disgrace of a major American city being rendered uninhabitable on his watch. He has yet to come face to face with people left to suffer for days in hellish conditions and explain to them why their government failed them. And he has yet to demonstrate the strength that Americans require from their president in a time of crisis.\n \n This crisis finds the president looking impotent at best, incompetent at worst. And there is an element of whining to Bush's refusal to shoulder his responsibility -- especially should the press continue to make it clear how intensely he and his top aides are trying to pass the buck.\n \n The men behind Bush's bubble are clearly hoping that their tried and true methods will serve them well yet again and that over time, Bush's reputation will recover.\n \n But with every body removed from the attics of New Orleans over the coming weeks, America will remember the colossal failure of government to protect its people.\n \n The Overviews\n \n Here's Tim Russert talking to Matt Lauer on NBC's Today Show this morning: \"Eventually, Matt, there has to be some level of accountability,\" Russert said. \"Something terrible happened here. The fact is state, local and federal government did not protect its people. It's why governments were created. . . .\n \n \"Will Katrina and the stumbling of the federal government define his second term? That's why the president has to be bold and assertive in trying to correct that impression.\"\n \n Newsweek asks: \"What went wrong? Just about everything. How the system failed is a tangled story, but the basic narrative is becoming clearer: hesitancy, bureaucratic rivalries, failures of leadership from city hall to the White House and epically bad luck combined to create a morass. . . .\n \n \"Bush's many critics will say that the president was disengaged, on vacation, distracted by Iraq and insensitive to the needs of poor black people. The White House blames the magnitude of the storm itself, patchy information on the ground and a confused chain of command, according to a senior Bush aide who requests anonymity in order to speak freely about internal administration discussions. The truth probably lies somewhere in between. . . . Still, we expect more from a president.\"\n \n Matthew Cooper writes in Time magazine about Bush's second trip to the disaster zone: \"It was better than his first on Friday. He didn't offer any untenable defenses of the federal response and he didn't say anything too off key like he did last time when he vowed to rebuild Mississippi Sen. Trent Lott's home and fondly recalled his partying days in New Orleans. . . .\n \n \"Still, his visit studiously avoided the hardest-hit areas of Katrina and the itinerary all but guaranteed that he'd be met with friendly audiences. The displaced persons he met at the Bethany World Church were well cared for and for the most part grateful for their surroundings. In Poplarville, Mississippi, Bush toured a middle class neighborhood where the damage seemed minimal. Homes were intact, although many pine trees were felled. But most seemed to have hit lawns and carports rather than causing real structural damage to homes. . . .\n \n \"Much of Bush's presidency has been built around keeping him away from unfriendly audiences. His campaign rallies were carefully screened and so are his policy events where he chews the fat about issues like Social Security. But that instinct surely can't be serving him well at a time when the country feels like a collective primal scream over seeing their countrymen left suffering.\"\n \n Dan Balz writes in The Washington Post: \"The first week of September 2005 likely will be remembered as one of the most troubled weeks of George W. Bush's presidency, a time in which natural disaster combined with bureaucratic bungling in ways that threatened to inundate an administration already on the defensive.\n \n \"Even before Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast last Monday, Bush was buffeted by public dissatisfaction over the war in Iraq and consumer outrage over rising gasoline prices. But the federal government's widely criticized response to the hurricane's devastation in New Orleans and elsewhere turned a challenging environment into one that is potentially overwhelming. . . .\n \n \"Public opinion appears to have been shaped considerably by the partisan polarization that long has defined attitudes toward Bush. In part, Bush may be reaping some of the consequences of a governing style that has favored confrontation over conciliation, of appealing first and foremost to his conservative base rather than the country as a whole.\"\n \n Ronald Brownstein writes in the Los Angeles Times: \"The natural instinct of any administration is to circle the wagons when hit with the sort of criticism buffeting the White House over the federal government's response to Hurricane Katrina.\n \n \"President Bush is probably even more resistant than most of his predecessors to admitting error or reexamining decisions. . . .\n \n \"But the national interest demands that the president now rise above that defensive crouch. After a week of despair, suffering and terrifying chaos in New Orleans, this is a moment for the president to be knocking heads, demanding answers and imposing changes throughout the federal government.\"\n \n Todd S. Purdum writes in the New York Times: \"Perhaps not since Richard M. Nixon faced Vietnam-era tumult abroad and at home has an American president had to meet quite the combination of foreign war, domestic tribulations and political division that President Bush now confronts, from the Persian Gulf to the Gulf Coast to Capitol Hill.\"\n \n In USA Today, Judy Keen and Richard Benedetto have an account from a White House insider suggesting that Bush, after initially being patient, is now angry. Note, however, the utter lack of sourcing:\n \n \"Bush's patience with federal hurricane relief efforts evaporated last week when he learned that thousands had been stuck for days in the New Orleans Convention Center without food or water. By Saturday morning, when he and other officials met in the White House situation room for an update, the president was still steaming. He had seen the disaster in person and watched horrific scenes on TV. There was talk around the table that if this disaster was a dress rehearsal for response to a terrorist attack or other national security crisis, the federal government failed the test.\"\n \n An example of the president's loss of patience: \"Bush skipped his usual weekend biking outings and went to a Red Cross operations center in Washington on Sunday. His trip Monday was meant to underscore his concern. He'll visit again.\"\n \n Keen and Benedetto also write: \"In a flurry of e-mail exchanges late Saturday night when they learned about Chief Justice William Rehnquist's death, President Bush's top advisers debated -- after their most difficult week since 9/11 -- what calamity might be next.\"\n \n The Political Campaign\n \n Adam Nagourney and Anne E. Kornblut write in the New York Times: \"Under the command of President Bush's two senior political advisers, the White House rolled out a plan this weekend to contain the political damage from the administration's response to Hurricane Katrina.\n \n \"It orchestrated visits by cabinet members to the region, leading up to an extraordinary return visit by Mr. Bush planned for Monday, directed administration officials not to respond to attacks from Democrats on the relief efforts, and sought to move the blame for the slow response to Louisiana state officials, according to Republicans familiar with the White House plan.\n \n \"The effort is being directed by Mr. Bush's chief political adviser, Karl Rove, and his communications director, Dan Bartlett.\"\n \n What took so long?\n \n Some Republicans told the Times \"that the normally nimble White House political operation had fallen short in part because the president and his aides were scattered outside Washington on vacation, leaving no one obviously in charge at a time of great disruption. Mr. Rove and Mr. Bush were in Texas, while Vice President Dick Cheney was at his Wyoming ranch.\n \n \"Mr. Bush's communications director, Nicolle Devenish, was married this weekend in Greece, and a number of Mr. Bush's political advisers -- including Ken Mehlman, the Republican National Committee chairman -- attended the wedding.\"\n \n As Nagourney and Kornblut explain, Rove's job one is \"to shift the blame away from the White House and toward officials of New Orleans and Louisiana who, as it happens, are Democrats.\"\n \n That started on Saturday.\n \n Manuel Roig-Franzia and Spencer Hsu wrote in Sunday's Washington Post: \"Bush, who has been criticized, even by supporters, for the delayed response to the disaster, used his weekly radio address to put responsibility for the failure on lower levels of government. The magnitude of the crisis 'has created tremendous problems that have strained state and local capabilities,' he said. 'The result is that many of our citizens simply are not getting the help they need, especially in New Orleans. And that is unacceptable.' \"\n \n One \"senior Bush official\" went so far as to assert that Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco had still had not declared a state of emergency as of Saturday -- a charge so inaccurate that The Post was forced to run a correction.\n \n Elisabeth Bumiller and Adam Nagourney wrote in Sunday's New York Times: \"In a sign of the mounting anxiety at the White House, Mr. Bush made a rare Saturday appearance in the Rose Garden before live television cameras. . . .\n \n \"As Mr. Bush spoke, Vice President Dick Cheney and Karl Rove, the president's senior political adviser, listened on the sidelines, as did Dan Bartlett, the counselor to the president and Mr. Bush's overseer of communications strategy. Their presence underscored how seriously the White House is reacting to the political crisis it faces.\"\n \n Jim VandeHei wrote in Sunday's Washington Post: \"Louisiana officials pushed back hard against the White House yesterday, sharply criticizing President Bush for offering a tentative and insufficient response to the obliteration of New Orleans and then trying to shift the blame to the state and local governments.\n \n \"Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) accused Bush of failing to fund efforts to fortify the levee protecting New Orleans before Hurricane Katrina hit, and of failing to send troops, supplies and other assistance quickly enough in Katrina's aftermath. 'Would the president please stop taking photo-ops, and please come and see what I'm trying to show him?' Landrieu asked on ABC's 'This Week.' She threatened to 'punch' Bush or anyone else who criticizes the response of the local sheriffs, one day after administration officials blamed state and local authorities for missteps in relief and rescue efforts.\"\n \n Scott Shane writes for the New York Times: \"As the Bush administration tried to show a more forceful effort to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina, government officials on Sunday escalated their criticism and sniping over who was to blame for the problems plaguing the initial response. . . .\n \n \" 'We wanted soldiers, helicopters, food and water,' said Denise Bottcher, press secretary for Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana. 'They wanted to negotiate an organizational chart.' \"\n \n Busy Labor Day\n \n Bush made three public appearances in the Gulf Coast area yesterday -- all inland, far from the worst damage.\n \n Here are Bush's remarks at a shelter at Bethany World Church in Baton Rouge; at an emergency operations center in Baton Rouge, and while visiting with residents in Poplarville , Miss.\n \n \"I understand. I understand the damage. I understand the devastation. I understand the destruction. I understand how long it's going to take. And we're with you. That's what I want you to know,\" he told the residents of Poplarville, where some trees fell on carports.\n",

While severe, the four Florida hurricanes (Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne) caused under 100 deaths and $22 billion in damage, a fraction of Katrina's destructive force. Yet FEMA's proactive role and President Bush's timely and personal involvement in Florida bear no relation to 2005:\n \n Hurricane Charley in August 2004 saw FEMA, National Guard troops, relief supplies and President Bush on stand by before the storm even made landfall.\n \n FEMA again prepositioned personnel, supplies, and equipment for the Frances, which struck in the first week of September.\n \n This performance was repeated for Ivan and Jeanne, which hit two and three weeks later, respectively. Again, FEMA was in place with food, ice, water, and financial aid in advance of the arrival of the storms. \n \n As for Louisiana Governor Blanco, she shouldn't expect the Jeb treatment any time soon. In fact, portraying her and other state local officials as the bogeymen in the Katrina disaster is essential to the White House's strategy for Bush's political survival. \n\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/05/national/nationalspecial/05bush.html?pagewanted=print",

   "Here's a big DOH!\n \n Well, I guess I'll eat a bit of crow (not much mind you).\n \n \n http://www.nola.com/newsflash/louisiana/index.ssf?base/news-18/1125239940201382.xml&storylist=louisiana\n \n\n Mandatory evacuation ordered for New Orleans\n 8/28/2005, 10:48 a.m. CT\n The Associated Press \n \n NEW ORLEANS (AP) - In the face of a catastrophic Hurricane Katrina, a mandatory evacuation was ordered Sunday for New Orleans by Mayor Ray Nagin.\n \n Acknowledging that large numbers of people, many of them stranded tourists, would be unable to leave, the city set up 10 places of last resort for people to go, including the Superdome.\n \n The mayor called the order unprecedented and said anyone who could leave the city should. He exempted hotels from the evacuation order because airlines had already cancelled all flights.\n \n Gov. Kathleen Blanco, standing beside the mayor at a news conference, said President Bush called and personally appealed for a mandatory evacuation for the low-lying city, which is prone to flooding.\n \n \"There doesn't seem to be any relief in sight,\" Blanco said.\n \n She said Interstate 10, which was converted Saturday so that all lanes headed one-way out of town, was total gridlock.\n \n \"We are facing a storm that most of us have long feared,\" Nagin said.\n \n The storm surge most likely could topple the city's levee system, which protect it from surrounding waters of Lake Pontchartrain, the Mississippi River and marshes, the mayor said. The bowl-shaped city must pump water out during normal times, and the hurricane threatened pump power.\n \n Previous hurricanes evacuations in New Orleans were always voluntary, because so many people don't have the means of getting out. Some are too poor and there is always a French Quarter full of tourists who get caught.\n \n \"This is a once in a lifetime event,\" the mayor said. \"The city of New Orleans has never seen a hurricane of this magnitude hit it directly,\" the mayor said.\n \n He told those who had to move to the Superdome to come with enough food for several days and with blankets. He said it will be a very uncomfortable place and encouraged everybody who could to get out.\n \n Nagin said police and firefighters would spread out throughout the city sounding sirens and using bullhorns to tell residents to get out. He also said police would have the authority to comandeer any vehicle or building that could be used for evacuation or shelter.\n \n The Superdome was already taking in people with special problems. It opened about 8 a.m. and people on walkers, some with oxygen tanks, began checking in.\n \n In a neighborhood in central city, a group of residents sat on a porch. It was almost a party atmosphere.\n \n \"We're not evacuating,\" said Julie Paul, 57. \"None of us have any place to go. We're counting on the Superdome. That's our lifesaver.\"\n \n She said they'd spent the last couple of hurricanes there. They would wait for a friend who has a van to take them, because none has cars.\n \n At a nearby gas station, Linda Young, 37, was tanking up her car.\n \n \"I'm really scared. I've been through hurricanes, but this one scares me. I think everybody needs to get out,\" she said.\n \n She said they planned to leave Saturday but couldn't get gas, and didn't want to go without it, so got up early and got in a gas line.\n \n In the suburbs, evacuations were under way.\n \n \"That sun is shining too bright for this to be happening,\" said Joyce Tillis, manager of the Holiday Inn Select at the airport in the suburbs as she called the more than 140 guests to tell them the hotel was under a mandatory evacuation. \"It's too nice a day.\"\n \n Tillis lives inside the flood zone in the community of Avondale. She said she called her three daughters and told them to get out. \"If I'm stuck, I'm stuck,\" Tillis said. \"I'd rather save my second generation if I can.\"\n\n \n So it seems that the only reason there was a mandatory evacuation was because Bush called Blanco and suggested it. emoticon_wow",

Slaughter (D-NY), the ranking Democrat on the Committee, led opposition to the rule.\n \n The bill, which enjoys bipartisan support, is expected to pass on the House floor tomorrow.\n \n Democrats implored Republicans to allow amendments, which would enable consideration of measures such as which areas and to which agencies relief dollars were most needed and how to restructure FEMA so that it would be more effective.\n \n \"We've been on vacation for five weeks. Now, in our first week back, the Republican Leadership would rather duck and run than discuss what's happened in the wake of Hurricane Katrina,\" Slaughter told RAW STORY in a statement. \"Life in the Gulf Coast is no vacation. The Federal Government failed the American people in its initial response to this horrible disaster and by their actions; the Republican Leadership is once again showing that their priorities are out of sync with the needs of so many hard working families.\"\n \n \"It is this very lack of accountability in government which ensured that our disaster response would be a bigger disaster than the hurricane itself.

Essentially, these states would become \"united\" in their disaster planning resources, preparation, and management.\n\n I guess that I should have read all the way through before replying. :) \n \n\n We could call these collectives \"The United States of America.\" Kind of catchy, don't you think?\n\n Yep. notice it isn't \"United Federal America\". emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n Sarcasm aside, it's likely that your line of thinking would result in a third  layer of major government--state level, states collective level, and Federal level. Not exactly the best way to reduce big government.\n\n \n I'd eliminate one layer, the Feds. We've already seen that it is the least efficient provider of goods and services.\n I don't catch Rush's show very often but happened to do so today. One statement stood out. $0.78 of every welfare dollar goes to administrative costs, leaving only $0.22 for the recipient. emoticon_wow \n Would you want them to run your programs for you with that sort of track record?",

Thomas, 47, of Tyler, Texas; Thomas Sherman, 39, also of Tyler; and Lasharon Lemons, 36, of Dallas, said Major John Marie with the Plaquemines Parish Sheriff's Office.\n \n Marie said that since the relief effort began, drivers for the Federal Emergency Management Agency had been allowed to take drinks, personal grooming supplies and other small items from the Family Dollar store at 7902 Louisiana 23.\n \n But he said the three suspects went much further, loading the cabs of their trucks with toys such as Barbie dolls, kitchen appliances, telephones, answering machines, waste paper baskets and other goods.\n \n \"When we arrested them, they had enough stolen stuff to fill five grocery carts full of property,\" Marie said.\n \n No bail had been set on the three drivers because there is no judge in Plaquemines to hear their cases, Marie said.\n \n The arrests were the first in the parish for looting, a problem that has been widespread in neighboring New Orleans and Jefferson Parish since Katrina hit on August 29.\n \n Under Louisiana law, a conviction for looting carries a maximum prison sentence of 15 years, a fine of not more than $10,000, or both.\n",

   "Man who told Cheney to go F himself is detained!!!\n \n U-S-A! U-S-A!\n \n http://opednews.com/articles/opedne_jackson__050909_physician_who_told_o.htm\n \n \nPhysician who told Cheney to go F*ck Himself Lost his Home in Katrina, Detained, Cuffed by Cheney's M-16-carrying Goons\n \n by Jackson Thoreau\n \n http://www.opednews.com\n \n Dr. Ben Marble, a young emergency room physician who plays in alternative rock bands and does art on the side, needs our help. Since he was the one who told Dick Cheney to \"go **** yourself\" on Sept. 8, that's the least we can do.\n \n Marble is a complex guy, to say the least. Some of the lyrics he writes can be considered harsh by some - personally what I've heard is very much on target - but he has a softer side as an organizer of breast cancer fund-raisers, not to mention an ER doctor.\n \n When he, like thousands of others, lost his home due to Hurricane Katrina last week, it was the single most traumatic week of his life. That led to his Sept. 8 confrontation with the man who best represents the worst of the most callous, heartless, shittiest administration in U.S. history.\n \n As Marble explains, he was driving to his destroyed house Sept. 8 in Gulfport, Ms., when military police refused to allow him to cross a barricade that was about 200 feet from his home. They forced him to drive an extra 20 minutes and spend even more on gasoline.\n \n \"Thanks to Dubya Gump and Mr. Cheney, gas is really expensive and extremely hard to get anywhere Katrina has destroyed,\" Marble wrote. \"So needless to say, I was extremely aggravated that they wouldn't let me pass.\"\n \n Suddenly a long line of dark cars pulled up, and they honked at Marble to back up to let them through the barricade that supposedly no one could drive through. That only made Marble madder so he did what most of us would do - or at least consider doing.\n \n \"I waved a middle finger at the caravan,\" Marble wrote.\n \n After driving the extra 20 minutes and filming video of destruction along the way, he made it to his home. Marble overheard a neighbor say that Cheney was down the street talking to people. That's when he got the idea to go meet Dr. Evil himself.\n \n \"I am no fan of Mr. Cheney because of several reasons,\" Marble wrote. \"For those who don't know, Mr. Cheney is infamous for telling Senator [Pat] Leahy 'go fu** yourself' on the Senate floor. Also, I am not happy about the fact that thousands have died due to the slow action of FEMA, not to even mention the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time, i.e. Iraq.\"\n \n So Marble asked a couple police officers if he and a friend could walk down to Cheney. They told him Cheney was \"looking forward\" to talking to \"the locals.\"\n \n \"So we grabbed my Canon digital rebel and my Sony videocamera and started walking down the street,\" Marble wrote. \"And then right in front of the destroyed tennis court I used to play on Dick Cheney was giving a pep rally, talking to the press. The Secret Service guys patted us down and waved the wands over us, and then let us pass.\"\n \n As he stood about 10 feet away from Cheney and his friend and some camera operators from CNN and other media filmed the scene, Marble suddenly yelled, \"Go **** yourself, Mr. Cheney! Go **** yourself, you *******!\"\n \n Hey, at least Marble was polite. After all, he referred to Cheney as \"Mr. Cheney.\"\n \n \"I had no intention of harming anyone but merely wanted to echo Mr. Cheney's infamous words back at him,\" Marble wrote. \"At that moment, I noticed the Secret Service guys with a panic-stricken look on their faces, like they were about to tackle me, so I calmly walked away back to my former house.\"\n \n His friend videotaped a little bit longer and then came back to Marble's house. As they were salvaging a few things from Marble's home, two military police waving M-16's showed up and said they were looking\n for someone who fit Marble's description who had cursed at Cheney.\n \n \"I told them I was probably the person they were looking for, and so they put me in handcuffs and 'detained' me for about 20 minutes or so,\" Marble wrote. \"My right thumb went numb because the cuffs were on so tight, but they were fairly courteous and eventually released me after getting all my contact info. They said I had NOT broken any laws so I was free to go.\"\n \n So let's get this straight: A physician with a newborn baby loses most everything he owns in the hurricane, does what most of us WANT to do and \"echoes\" Cheney's words he spoke on the Senate floor last year, walks away harmlessly, mission accomplished, and then once the media cameras leave, he is treated like a foreign terrorist as Cheney's goons waving M-16s handcuff him in front of his destroyed home? Had it not been for the media cameras filming the initial scene, I doubt Cheney's goons would have just let Marble go after 20 minutes.\n \n America, land of the free?\n \n Marble and his family have been in the media spotlight before, including his wife, Lisa, and baby, Sofia Grace, who was born shortly after the storm, on CNN. Marble has also been interviewed in art magazines and the Biloxi Sun Herald about his concert fund-raisers and musical success - one of his bands, dR. O, has had at least 20 No. 1 songs on the MP3.com charts.\n \n \"The truth is even with all our losses, we are still luckier than many people down here because at least we didn't die,\" Marble wrote. \"But I thought I could try to raise some awareness to the bad policies of the Dubya Gump administration and also possibly raise some money to replace the many things we lost, and so I decided I would auction the videotape my friend shot of the event. I will also grant an interview to the winner if so desired.\"\n \n So go to eBay here and place a bid for this important video to help Marble raise some needed funds. I have done so and was at least at one time the high bidder.\n \n Marble also has an Internet site with photographs of some damage in his town at www.HurricaneKatrinaSucked.com. A photo of him is here, and you can also email Marble at clone9@yahoo.com.\n \n Dr. Ben Marble, you rock. May we all return the favor.\n",

Traditionally, the job of FEMA director was given to a political supporter of the President who wanted some plum position but who had no experience with emergencies. I made a mental note to avoid that mistake if I won. Voters don't chose a President based on how he'll handle disasters, but if they're faced with one themselves, it quickly becomes the most important issue in their lives.\"\n \n -Bill Clinton, My Life (p. 428)\n",

Blanco took the necessary steps to request emergency and major disaster declarations AND Pres. Bush took the necessary steps to trigger the availability of Stafford Act emergency assistance and disaster assistance.\n \n So, whose to blame?\n \n FEMA for one, then the biggest blame lies with the lousy evacuation \"plans\" written up for the city.\n \n \n People keep bringing up these buses, but there wasn't really a solid plan for evacuation using those buses. There certainly hadn't been any kind of drills or practice of the evacuation using buses.\n \n The evacuation using people's private cars was a total mess that almost left people stranded on the highway during the hurricane. I can't imagine how screwed up it would be to try to round up thousands of people without cars (who actually wanted to evacuate) and put them on city buses and school buses then bus them out of the city, all within 24-36 hours (or whenever the madatory evactuation order was given).\n \n Surely, (well, hopefully) there will be a solid plan to evacuate people and not just hoard them into shelters.\n \n Also, check this out (it's a pretty funny blog, but this isn't funny):\n http://patriotboy.blogspot.com/2005_09_11_patriotboy_archive.html#112647785470600928\n \n\n Meet your local FEMA Director \n \n The federal government's response to the Hurricane Katrina disaster stands as a testament to Our Leader's ability to pick the right people for the vitally important job of blaming Democrats for the Administration's failures. \n \n Certainly, Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff and FEMA Director Mike Brown proved that they're up to that most important of tasks, but what about their deputies who head FEMA's regional offices? Do they have the political communication skills they'll need in time of crisis. Or are they simply Clinton Era holdovers, appointed by the enemy to use their emergency management expertise to thwart Our Leader's budget priorities?\n \n Fortunately, the former seems to be the case.

   "OH! Chertoff's the one that should really go down!\n \n http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0914-04.htm\n \n \n Chertoff Delayed Federal Response, Memo Shows\n by Jonathan S. Landay, Alison Young and Shannon McCaffrey\n \n WASHINGTON - The federal official with the power to mobilize a massive federal response to Hurricane Katrina was Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, not the former FEMA chief who was relieved of his duties and resigned earlier this week, federal documents reviewed by Knight Ridder show.\n \n Even before the storm struck the Gulf Coast, Chertoff could have ordered federal agencies into action without any request from state or local officials. Federal Emergency Management Agency chief Michael Brown had only limited authority to do so until about 36 hours after the storm hit, when Chertoff designated him as the \"principal federal official\" in charge of the storm.\n \n As thousands of hurricane victims went without food, water and shelter in the days after Katrina's early morning Aug. 29 landfall, critics assailed Brown for being responsible for delays that might have cost hundreds of lives.\n \n But Chertoff - not Brown - was in charge of managing the national response to a catastrophic disaster, according to the National Response Plan, the federal government's blueprint for how agencies will handle major natural disasters or terrorist incidents. An order issued by President Bush in 2003 also assigned that responsibility to the homeland security director.\n \n But according to a memo obtained by Knight Ridder, Chertoff didn't shift that power to Brown until late afternoon or evening on Aug. 30, about 36 hours after Katrina hit Louisiana and Mississippi. That same memo suggests that Chertoff may have been confused about his lead role in disaster response and that of his department.\n \n \"As you know, the President has established the `White House Task Force on Hurricane Katrina Response.' He will meet with us tomorrow to launch this effort. The Department of Homeland Security, along with other Departments, will be part of the task force and will assist the Administration with its response to Hurricane Katrina,\" Chertoff said in the memo to the secretaries of defense, health and human services and other key federal agencies.\n \n On the day that Chertoff wrote the memo, Bush was in San Diego presiding over a ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II.\n \n Chertoff's Aug. 30 memo for the first time declared Katrina an \"Incident of National Significance,\" a key designation that triggers swift federal coordination. The following afternoon, Bush met with his Cabinet, then appeared before TV cameras in the White House Rose Garden to announce the government's planned action.\n \n That same day, Aug. 31, the Department of Defense, whose troops and equipment are crucial in such large disasters, activated its Task Force Katrina. But active-duty troops didn't begin to arrive in large numbers along the Gulf Coast until Saturday.\n \n White House and homeland security officials wouldn't explain why Chertoff waited some 36 hours to declare Katrina an incident of national significance and why he didn't immediately begin to direct the federal response from the moment on Aug. 27 when the National Hurricane Center predicted that Katrina would strike the Gulf Coast with catastrophic force in 48 hours. Nor would they explain why Bush felt the need to appoint a separate task force.\n \n Chertoff's hesitation and Bush's creation of a task force both appear to contradict the National Response Plan and previous presidential directives that specify what the secretary of homeland security is assigned to do without further presidential orders. The goal of the National Response Plan is to provide a streamlined framework for swiftly delivering federal assistance when a disaster - caused by terrorists or Mother Nature - is too big for local officials to handle.\n \n Dana Perino, a White House spokeswoman, referred most inquiries about the memo and Chertoff's actions to the Department of Homeland Security.\n \n \"There will be an after-action report\" on the government's response to Hurricane Katrina, Perino said. She added that \"Chertoff had the authority to invoke the Incident of National Significance, and he did it on Tuesday.\"\n \n Perino said the creation of the White House task force didn't add another bureaucratic layer or delay the response to the devastating hurricane. \"Absolutely not,\" she said. \"I think it helped move things along.\" When asked whether the delay in issuing the Incident of National Significance was to allow Bush time to return to Washington, Perino replied: \"Not that I'm aware of.\"\n \n Russ Knocke, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, didn't dispute that the National Response Plan put Chertoff in charge in federal response to a catastrophe. But he disputed that the bureaucracy got in the way of launching the federal response.\n \n \"There was a tremendous sense of urgency,\" Knocke said. \"We were mobilizing the greatest response to a disaster in the nation's history.\"\n \n Knocke noted that members of the Coast Guard were already in New Orleans performing rescues and FEMA personnel and supplies had been deployed to the region.\n \n The Department of Homeland Security has refused repeated requests to provide details about Chertoff's schedule and said it couldn't say specifically when the department requested assistance from the military. Knocke said a military liaison was working with FEMA, but said he didn't know his or her name or rank. FEMA officials said they wouldn't provide information about the liaison.\n \n Knocke said members of almost every federal agency had already been meeting as part of the department's Interagency Incident Management Group, which convened for the first time on the Friday before the hurricane struck. So it would be a mistake, he said, to interpret the memo as meaning that Tuesday, Aug. 30 was the first time that members of the federal government coordinated.\n \n The Chertoff memo indicates that the response to Katrina wasn't left to disaster professionals, but was run out of the White House, said George Haddow, a former deputy chief of staff at FEMA during the Clinton administration and the co-author of an emergency management textbook.\n \n \"It shows that the president is running the disaster, the White House is running it as opposed to Brown or Chertoff,\" Haddow said. Brown \"is a convenient fall guy. He's not the problem really. The problem is a system that was marginalized.\"\n \n A former FEMA director under President Reagan expressed shock by the inaction that Chertoff's memo suggested. It showed that Chertoff \"does not have a full appreciation for what the country is faced with - nor does anyone who waits that long,\" said Gen. Julius Becton Jr., who was FEMA director from 1985-1989.\n \n \"Anytime you have a delay in taking action, there's a potential for losing lives,\" Becton told Knight Ridder. \"I have no idea how many lives we're talking about. ... I don't understand why, except that they were inefficient.\"\n \n Chertoff's Aug. 30 memo came on the heels of a memo from Brown, written several hours after Katrina made landfall, showing that the FEMA director was waiting for Chertoff's permission to get help from others within the massive department. In that memo, first obtained by the Associated Press last week, Brown requested Chertoff's \"assistance to make available DHS employees willing to deploy as soon as possible.\" It asked for another 1,000 homeland security workers within two days and 2,000 within a week.\n \n The four-paragraph memo ended with Brown thanking Chertoff \"for your consideration in helping us meet our responsibilities in this near catastrophic event.\"\n \n According to the National Response Plan, which was unveiled in January by Chertoff's predecessor, Tom Ridge, the secretary of homeland security is supposed to declare an Incident of National Significance when a catastrophic event occurs.\n \n \"Standard procedures regarding requests for assistance may be expedited or, under extreme circumstances, suspended in the immediate aftermath of an event of catastrophic magnitude,\" according to the plan, which evolved from earlier plans and lessons learned after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. \"Notification and full coordination with the States will occur, but the coordination process must not delay or impede the rapid deployment and use of critical resources.\"\n \n Should Chertoff have declared Katrina an Incident of National Significance sooner - even before the storm struck? Did his delay slow the quick delivery of the massive federal response that was needed? Would it have made a difference?\n \n \"You raise good questions,\" said Frank J. Cilluffo, the director of George Washington University's Homeland Security Planning Institute. It's too early to tell, he said, whether unfamiliarity with or glitches in the new National Response Plan were factors in the poor early response to Katrina.\n \n \"Clearly this is the first test. It certainly did not pass with flying colors,\" Cilluffo said of the National Response Plan.\n \n Mike Byrne, a former senior homeland security official under Ridge who worked on the plan, said he doesn't think the new National Response Plan caused the confusion that plagued the early response to Katrina.\n \n Something else went wrong, he suspects. The new National Response Plan isn't all that different from the previous plan, called the Federal Response Plan.\n \n \"Our history of responding to major disasters has been one where we've done it well,\" Byrne said. \"We need to figure out why this one didn't go as well as the others did. It's shocking to me.\"\n \n Chertoff's Aug. 30 memo is posted at www.krwashington.com\n \n Read the National Response Plan.\n",

In the past two days, the 80-member task force had identified seven dead bodies in the same neighborhood, and they had rescued no one.\n \n The rescue pumped up the spirits of Task Force 5, which has been mostly marking the locations of bodies for the last week. Earlier, they had been frustrated when FEMA delayed their deployment for four days, housing them in the Hyatt Regency in Dallas.\n \n They were frustrated further when they were given the FEMA order that they weren't allowed to force their way into houses to search them. They hope Hollingsworth's rescue will coax FEMA to rethink its directive.\n \n Think about that the next time some right-wing schlock-radio host tries to spin all the blame away from FEMA and away from Bush and back onto the mayor and the governor.\n \n And when George W.

Hillary Clinton to establish an independent, bipartisan panel patterned after the 9/11 Commission to investigate what went wrong with federal, state and local governments' response to Hurricane Katrina.\n \n The New York Democrat's bid to establish the panel - which would have also made recommendations on how to improve the government's disaster response apparatus - failed to win the two-thirds majority needed to overcome procedural hurdles. Clinton got only 44 votes, all from Democrats and independent Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont. Fifty-four Republicans all voted no.\n \n \"Just as with 9/11, we did not get to the point where we believed we understood what happened until an independent investigation was conducted,\" Clinton said.\n \n The Senate vote is hardly likely to be the last word on whether to create an independent commission or as an alternative a special congressional committee to investigate Katrina. The 9/11 Commission was established in 2002 after resistance from Republicans and the White House, and opinion polls show the public strongly supports the idea. In a CNN/USA Today Gallup poll taken Sept. 8-11, 70 percent of those surveyed supported an independent panel to investigate the government's response to Katrina. Only 29 percent were opposed.\n \n Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has rebuffed a bid by House and Senate GOP leaders to create a committee patterned after the 1987\n Iran-Contra panel that would have a GOP majority - reflecting their dominance of Congress.\n \n Reid has instead vowed that any bid by Republican leaders to establish a special bipartisan committee involving lawmakers from both House and Senate will go forward only if Democrats have equal representation.\n \n Separately, Senate Homeland Security Committee chair Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Wednesday that Post-9/11 changes to improve the government response to catastrophic disasters failed their first major test in Hurricane Katrina's wake.\n \n Despite billions of dollars to boost disaster preparedness at all levels of government, the response to Katrina was plagued by confusion, communication failures and widespread lack of coordination, said Collins as she opened hearings into the disaster.\n \n \"At this point, we would have expected a sharp, crisp response to this terrible tragedy,\" Collins said. \"Instead, we witnessed what appeared to be a sluggish initial response.\"\n \n The hearing marked Congress' first step in investigating major gaps in the country's readiness and response systems that Katrina exposed. It comes even as Republican and Democrats grapple over whether to appoint an unusual House-Senate panel to investigate the matter, or to create an 9/11-style commission.\n \n Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the committee, said the response to Katrina \"has shaken the public's confidence in the ability of government at all levels to protect them in a crisis.\"\n \n Lawmakers said they did not ask officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the Homeland Security Department to appear at the hearing out of fear that would disrupt the ongoing recovery process in the battered Gulf Coast. Instead, a slew of former city and state officials testified about their experiences in facing faced major disasters in their communities.\n \n Calling Katrina a \"national tragedy,\" former New Orleans Mayor Marc H. Morial put the primary responsibility for disaster response squarely on the federal government's shoulders. Morial, president of the National Urban League, was New Orleans' mayor from 1994 to 2004.\n \n Meanwhile, the House, by voice vote, on Wednesday approved legislation that provides liability protections for people and groups providing volunteer aid for Hurricane Katrina victims.\n \n House Judiciary Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said the Red Cross has cited lawsuit concerns among people interested in taking evacuees into their homes and that doctors traveling to states where they are not licensed face increased liability.\n \n The bill, which needs Senate action, would protect from lawsuit volunteers who in good faith and without expectation of compensation offer aid or medical assistance. It would not protect those who willfully carry out criminal acts.\n \n Other bills, however, to cut federal red tape and otherwise make it easier to get aid to Katrina victims have hit a slow patch as lawmakers wrestle over how to shape their response.\n \n They include proposals to provide Medicaid health benefits to those made homeless by Katrina, lift work rules for welfare recipients, and implement tax changes to help hurricane victims and charitable donors.\n",

   "http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-09-11-vulnerable-levees_x.htm\n \n by the late John Ritter, no less.\n \n\n Several cities are dependent on vulnerable levees\n \n By John Ritter, USA TODAY\n \n SAN FRANCISCO - A repeat of New Orleans' disastrous levee failures is not that far-fetched in a nation heavily dependent on the aging earthen structures to hold back floodwaters.\n \n Rudy Holt walks through an area of of his farm near Holt, Calif. on Jan. 11. The land was destroyed when a levee broke in June 2004. \n By Max Whittaker, AP\n \n A prime potential trouble spot is here in Northern California, where hundreds of thousands of people live on low-lying land protected by levees. Levee networks are also prominent across the Gulf Coast, in Florida and in heavily populated areas of the Midwest along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers.\n \n \"Levees are ubiquitous,\" says Gerry Galloway, a civil engineer who led a blue-ribbon study aimed at updating U.S. flood management after the devastating flooding along the upper Mississippi in 1993. \"There are levees that are marginal and levees that we don't know the answer to whether or not they're marginal. That's the worrisome part.\"\n \n A levee is an earth dam that runs along a river instead of across it.\n \n Conditions in Northern California's Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region, where the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers meet and dump into San Francisco Bay, aren't that different from New Orleans. Much of the delta was filled in a century ago for farming.\n \n An earthquake or prolonged, heavy storms could cause levees to rupture near urban areas, particularly around Sacramento. Houses in a booming residential area north of the city could be inundated with up to 20 feet of water.\n \n Widespread levee breaks also could imperil the water supply for 22 million Californians.\n \n A report in January by the state Department of Water Resources concluded that levees in the delta and the fast-growing Central Valley are deteriorating and that new housing and jobs are putting more people at flood risk. Yet in recent years, the report said, money to maintain levees has declined sharply.\n \n The delta includes nearly 60 islands and other spits of land below sea level kept dry, the state report said, by more than 600 miles of levees built on unstable peat soils. The state looks after 1,600 miles of levees that protect at least a half-million people.\n \n A levee break in dry, sunny weather in June 2004 flooded 12,000 acres of farmland and caused $150 million in damage. The cause, like the cause of most levee breaches, is unknown because rushing water washed away the evidence.\n \n In 1997, more than 50 California levees broke on rain-choked rivers and killed eight people, forced the evacuation of 100,000 and damaged or destroyed 24,000 homes.\n \n Levees have failed more than 140 times in the past century, the report said. Many were started when farmers simply pushed back dirt to protect crops. Over the years, they were lengthened and built higher, but the internal guts of those levees - sitting on land that gradually has sunk farther below sea level - often is unknown.\n \n \"So it's an old, aging system that instead of protecting farmland is actually protecting small cities, levees of questionable integrity protecting higher value real estate,\" says Lester Snow, director of the water resources department.\n \n Major levees engineered, built and inspected by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are more reliable than locally built and maintained levees. But even they can hide dangers. \"Regardless of the origin, it's very hard to tell what's going on within the guts of a levee,\" says Doug Plasencia, a Phoenix engineering consultant who worked on the Galloway report.\n \n Levees settle and can become unstable. Tunneling rodents can open up passageways for water to seep through. If a log was buried in the earth when a levee was built, then deteriorates over the years, an air space can be created that catches water and compromises a levee.\n \n The corps has recently upgraded its levee standards and is trying to better evaluate levees' conditions using sophisticated instruments. Plasencia urges a systematic, nationwide inventory of all levees, particularly those built \"by rural communities to divert flow around the town or to keep water out of a cotton field or citrus grove.\"\n \n The Galloway report had politically odious recommendations such as urging homeowners and farmers to move off flood plains - the areas floodwaters naturally spread onto - and return the area to wetlands, which absorb flooding.\n \n The report also recommended that the federal government require people living behind levees to buy flood insurance because of the \"residual risk\" and to beef up levee standards in urban areas. Congress has enacted none of the report's major recommendations.\n \n Few levees anywhere in the nation are built to more than a 100-year standard - capable of withstanding a flood so bad that its probability of occurring is once in a 100 years. The report urged a far more expensive 500-year standard for urban areas. In the Netherlands, levees along the Rhine River are built to a 1,250-year standard.\n \n In California, a worst-case scenario would be heavy rains and full reservoirs from Sierra Nevada snow pack runoff combined with earthquakes.\n \n \"The only thing we leave out is locust,\" Snow says.\n",

   "I keep forgetting that it wasn't the earthen levees that broke but it was concrete floodwalls (backed up by earth) that broke, in five places.\n \n http://www.nola.com/newslogs/tporleans/index.ssf?/mtlogs/nola_tporleans/archives/2005_09_13.html#079207\n \n \nMystery surrounds floodwall breaches\n Could a structural flaw be to blame?\n \n By John McQuaid\n Staff writer\n \n One of the central mysteries emerging in the Hurricane Katrina disaster is why concrete floodwalls in three canals breached during the storm, causing much of the catastrophic flooding, while earthen hurricane levees surrounding the city remained intact.\n \n It probably will take months to investigate and make a conclusive determination about what happened, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. But two Louisiana State University scientists who have examined the breaches suggest that a structural flaw in the floodwalls might be to blame.\n \n \"Why did we have no hurricane levee failures but five separate places with floodwall failures?\" asked Joseph Suhayda, a retired LSU coastal engineer who examined the breaches last week. \"That suggests there may be something about floodwalls that makes them more susceptible to failure. Did (the storm) exceed design conditions? What were the conditions? What about the construction?\"\n \n Ivor Van Heerden, who uses computer models to study storm-surge dynamics for the LSU Hurricane Center, has said that fragmentary initial data indicate that Katrina's storm-surge heights in Lake Pontchartrain would not have been high enough to top the canal walls and that a \"catastrophic structural failure\" occurred in the floodwalls.\n \n Corps project manager Al Naomi said that the Corps' working theory is that the floodwalls were well-constructed, but once topped they gave way after water scoured their interior sides, wearing away their earth-packed bases. But he said some other problem could have caused the breaches.\n \n \"They could have been overtopped. There could have been some structural failure. They could have been impacted by some type of debris,\" Naomi said. \"I don't think it's right to make some type of judgment now. It's like presuming the reason for a plane crash without recovering the black box.\"\n \n Officials long had warned about the danger of levees being topped by high water from a storm surge. Absent topping, floodwalls are supposed to remain intact.\n \n The floodwalls lining New Orleans canals consist of concrete sections attached to steel sheet pile drilled deep into the earth, fortified by a concrete and earthen base. The sections are joined with a flexible, waterproof substance.\n \n Floodwalls were breached in the 17th Street Canal, at two places in the London Avenue Canal, and at two places in the Industrial Canal, Suhayda said. Naomi said last week that one of the Industrial Canal breaches likely was caused by a loose barge that broke through it.\n \n Suhayda said that his inspection of the debris from the 17th Street Canal breach suggests the wall simply gave way. \"It looks to have been laterally pushed, not scoured in back with dirt being removed in pieces,\" he said. \"You can see levee material, some distance pushed inside the floodwall area, like a bulldozer pushed it.\"\n \n He suggested that because the walls failed in a few spots, the flaw may not be in the design but in the construction or materials.\n \n \"Those sections in the rest of the wall should have been subjected to the same forces as that section that failed,\" he said. \"Why did one side fail, not the other side?\"\n \n Drainage canals typically are lined with floodwalls instead of the wider earthen levees that protect the lakefront because of a lack of space, engineers say.\n \n \"It's a right-of-way issue,\" Naomi said. \"Usually, there are homes right up against the canal. You have to relocate five miles of homes (to build a levee), or you can build a floodwall.\"\n \n Constructing a more expensive earthen levee also would require building farther out into the canal itself, reducing the size of the canal - and the volume of water it could handle.\n \n Naomi said that an earthen levee also could have been breached if the surge had pushed water over the top. \"A levee failure might be more gradual than with a floodwall,\" he said. \"It means you may have flooded a little slower.\"\n \n The central question for engineers investigating the breaches will be whether the floodwalls were topped - and that's still unclear.\n \n The levee system, floodwalls included, is designed to protect against an average storm surge of 11.5 feet above sea level. The Corps adds several more feet of \"freeboard\" to account for waves and other dynamics.\n \n Naomi said the Industrial Canal floodwalls were topped by water coming in from the east. But scientists don't yet know exactly whether Katrina's Lake Pontchartrain surge was high enough to go over the wall in the two other canals.\n \n Many storm surge gauges stopped functioning during the storm, LSU climatologist Barry Keim, though initial data point to a mi-lake height of eight or nine feet. Heights typically are higher at the Lakefront area because wind pushes water higher against the levees.\n \n Suhayda said the debris line on the lakefront levee adjacent to the canal was \"several feet\" below the top. The levees are 17 or 18 feet high in that area. The canal levees, however, average only 14 feet. Storm surges have waves and other dynamics that push water still higher than the average height.\n \n \"There are big implications for as little as a one-foot change in elevation\" of the storm surge, Suhayda said.\n \n If the water did not top the levees, the breaches could prove more mysterious. Typically, the pounding of wave action would be the most likely way to cause a breach, scientists say. But there isn't much wave action in canals.\n \n \"Waves constantly breaking on the structure start to erode it and make it become unstable,\" said LSU coastal geologist Greg Stone, who studies storm-surge dynamics. \"But I don't think that was a major factor in the canals. You just don't have the (open area) to allow wave growth to occur.\"\n\n \n Now dig this part:\n \n Floodwalls were breached in the 17th Street Canal, at two places in the London Avenue Canal, and at two places in the Industrial Canal, Suhayda said. Naomi said last week that one of the Industrial Canal breaches likely was caused by a loose barge that broke through it.\n \n I remember being told stories of Hurricane Betsy in 1965 (wasn't quite born yet, giving away my age). \n \n During that hurricane, the Industrial Canal floodwall broke and flooded Arabi and the lower 9th Ward. The cause was credited to a barge that struck the wall.\n \n But, everyone suspected that the floodwall was breached deliberately on that side to save the French Quarter on the other side from flooding.\n \n I was told by a few that this reminded them of Betsy (but worse of course).",

   "Well, as much as I hate to do it, I just thought I'd spread this blog article around.\n \n http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/9/15/162119/706\n \n\n This WaPo article provides a fair overview of just some of the costs of Katrina. Apparently, Rove Bush has decided to throw money at the problem hand over fist, in an attempt to deflect criticism over his administration's unforgivable bungling in the most critical days after the storm. But the last sentences of the article are so spectacularly representative of the entire new-conservative movement that they really stand as a monument to the whole disaster:\n \n To reach $62 billion in savings, Cato Institute analysts Chris Edwards and Stephen Slivinski have proposed cutting NASA in half, slashing energy research and subsidies just as Congress is gearing up to increase them in the face of soaring gasoline prices, cutting the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' budget by $4.6 billion after its levees failed to protect New Orleans, and eliminating $4.2 billion in homeland security grants while lawmakers are debating the nation's lack of preparedness.\n \n A younger me would have marveled at the level of sheer square-headed poindexterism required to propose that, in order to finance the reconstruction of New Orleans... we further cut funding for the levees.\n \n The slightly older me, however, recognizes that even think-tank poindexterism isn't really at play here. These people honestly don't give a XXXX about the American population. Doesn't enter their heads. Their agenda is so far removed from even basic logic that it can only be compared to a religion. Conservative is less government philosophy than it is Rich Man's Religion. Gotta Cut, if it doesn't affect me personally. Gotta Spend, if I get a piece of that pie. Gotta Proselytize, if it convinces the poor suckers over the county line to check the box next to my name. Gotta Vote the way the party tells me to, or the money spigot gets turned off.\n \n So in Bush's speech tonight, we can expect to hear about a whole hell of a lot of money to be spent... and we can be assured that the money will continue to go to Bush-connected friends, not local businesses desperately in need of a way back on their feet.\n \n We can expect to hear a word or two about 'responsibility', if the focus group said it was needed. Just the word; not a whit else. Not a peep about the now hardly-shocking revelations that maybe, just maybe, Bush sycophant Brown was merely one of a sea of other Bush appointees who, to a man, didn't have the slightest idea of how to respond to an actual emergency that didn't involve making sure the Presidential Backdrop was printed and delivered in time. And still doesn't.\n \n The costs for rebuilding New Orleans are, indeed, going to be enormous. And given that the entire city is already being turned into a toxic trough for well-connected administration friends to feed at, I think we can expect the same level of corruption, cronyism, and incompetence that has been on display in every Bush-era issue from Enron and the California blackouts to the Iraq \"reconstruction\".\n \n It would appear Karl Rove has successfully been rid of his kidney stones. We'll watch tonight to see the first results, but I don't expect the color of the pee to markedly change.\n\n \n \n Anyway, we can keep talking about La. corruption, but I have to keep emphasizing that it in no way can compare to Washington corruption.",

We have to have a strategy for education and heath care, and he'll spell those out.\n \n * It's wrong to say it's either winning the war on terror or funding aftermath of Katrina. We have to do both that means we'll have to cut spending where else to make sure we are fiscally prudent with the taxpayer's dollars.\n \n * There's always discussion about raising taxes but right when businesses and people are trying to get back on their feet in the gulf coast region, the worst thing we can do with these families is pop them with another tax.\n \n * This is going to require difficult decisions in Washington.

The American people are forgiving with the truth, but angered when they see a whitewash.\n\n \n\n * Tonight President Bush will talk about how there is some optimism that we can see as we move forward. We're going to build a better Gulf Coast, a better New Orleans and we'll work with local officials to make sure that happens.\n \n Good, because America expects no less. We're all in this together. But a concerned nation wants to know what the Administration is doing to prevent this from happening again.\n\n My own thoughts.\n Building a \"better New Orleans\" had better not mean building another whitebread yuppified bland-XXX city done by a bunch of outside contractors who scoop up all the bids and leave nothing for local contractors, even though this is already happening. This also does nothing to address how to deal with insurance companies screwing people in Mississippi and Alabama by telling them that is was water that crushed their homes instead of wind, which clearly was the culprit there. Are people going to have to sue their insurance companies on their own, when they don't have a pot to pee in?\n \n\n * This will be a massive funding effort at every level of government. We shouldn't just look at government - we're seeing private charities, and the American people's enormous compassion.\n \n We agree, and we're moved by the compassion of the American people. It should provide inspiration for officials at all levels of government to respond equally well.\n\n \n \n \n* There were breakdowns of communication and planning at all levels of government - federal, state and local levels. It is very critical we learn why those breakdowns took place in the first place.\n \n A little GOP-style repetition here ... then \"stop politicizing the process\" ... we need a \"bipartisan commission\" ... stop the \"whitewash\" ...\n\n What a weak rebuttal. \n \n After 9/11, this shouldn't have happened anywhere in the US. The whole point of forming the huge beaurocracy of DHS was to deal with these sorts of thing. Bush said that they would do a review of the emergency plans of all major US cities. Larry King asked the most obvious question after the speech. \"Why wasn't this done 4 years ago after 9/11, or at least after forming DHS?\"\n \n What was the point of forming DHS if it doesn't work out what to do in these situations ahead of time?\n \n \n* Many parts of this will be chalked up to the fact it was one of the worst storms our country has ever faced. But there were things in a post-9/11 world that our government at all levels should be doing better and President Bush more than anybody else wants to find out why it took place and how it took place to make sure it doesn't happen again.\n \n Politicizing politicizing politicizing ... bipartisan bipartisan bipartisan ... whitewash whitewash whitewash ...\n\n Another pathetic rebuttal.\n \n When a dirty bomb goes off in your town, is DHS and FEMA going to fail again? When it does will Bush offer to find out what went wrong and make sure it doesn't happen again? He and DHS/FEMA were not prepared for this, and it's scary that in the post-9/11 world, the very agencies erected at great expense to deal with these problems on a national scale failed so miserably because of red tape. Red tape and breaking down inter-agency barriers was the purpose of DHS. DHS needs to either be rethought or scrapped altogether. Things seemed to work better when it wasn't there.\n \n \n* Bottom line now is all levels of government must take responsibility. This President is taking responsibility and what we have to do now is look forward.\n \n If it's about \"taking responsibility,\" why is Michael Chertoff still there? Is he waiting for a \"really huge emergency\"?\n\n That's not bad, but let me re-emphasize that \"taking responsibility\" should not mean doling out billions to your buddies to develop the gulf coast to their liking and for their own profit.\n \n \n \n* Senator Frist and Speaker Hastert have indicated that Congress will conduct a thorough investigation modeled after some of the most serious investigations that Congress has ever undertaken: the 1973 Watergate Committee, the 1987 Iran Contra Committee, the 1994 and 1995 Whitewater Committees and the 1997 Campaign Finance investigation.\n \n It is not modelled after those investigations, which in their bipartisan nature, reflected the best of the American process. You know the rest of the words here ... let's repeat them together ...\n\n The only thing that these other investigations have in common with the one proposed by Republicans for this situation is that they were done by congress. That's really it. \n \n \n\n * Tonight President Bush will talk about specifically what we'll talk about to help these tens of thousands of people who are literally living with only the shirts of their backs spread out throughout the country. We have to have a strategy for education and heath care, and he'll spell those out.\n \n Good. And we expect accountability to be built into the planning process.\n\n What? Republicans have a plan for health care that doesn't involve scrapping social security and medicare?\n \n \n \n* It's wrong to say it's either winning the war on terror or funding aftermath of Katrina. We have to do both that means we'll have to cut spending where else to make sure we are fiscally prudent with the taxpayer's dollars.\n \n We also want to both win the war on terror and fund the Katrina recovery. Hey! How about an exit strategy for that war that does neither?? (Oh, right, it will be Democrats responding ... never mind.)\n\n \n\n * There's always discussion about raising taxes but right when businesses and people are trying to get back on their feet in the gulf coast region, the worst thing we can do with these families is pop them with another tax.\n \n OK, fine - exempt them. But make sure all the millionaires around the country step up to the plate in this time of emergency, before we start cutting programs for the poor and middle class.\n\n \n \n \n* This is going to require difficult decisions in Washington. It's going to be important that we don't have the same ol' same ol' that we see in Washington. Tough choices will be to have made and President Bush is willing to do that.\n \n Make sure those \"tough choices\" aren't just a cover for ramrodding a radical right-wing agenda that has nothing to do with Katrina - you know, like suspending EPA rules or the Davis-Bacon Act. We wouldn't want you to think this was an \"opportunity moment\" like 9/11.\n",

There is a corps of engineers lake not far from here where they have lost control of the water flow because the outlet gates are stuck partially open and they do not have the budget to repair them for another year. The state and county have both offered to perform the repairs, but that is apparently against federal law.\n \n At the end of the day, it really does not matter whether the levees were repaired or not. A city in as rediculous a place as New Orleans is located is not going to do well when it gets hit by a category 5 storm. This is a far better example of stupididty than of goverment incompetence or an act of god. If you live in a city below sea level, built on silt, in hurricane country, you get what you get. I actually support the fact that we did not toss themoney needed into the levies. We cannot keep subsidizing stupidity forever. It just encourages stupid people to breed.\n \n That said, despite the fact that to build levees around new orleans is a complete wand utter waste of money, the federal government was supposed to be building and maintaining them, which they failed to do adequatly, largely because (at least for the last few years), the corps of engineers budget has been slashed. \n \n It seems to me that there are 2 lessons to learn from this. First, when it is a case of man vs nature, man will always loose. Nature does not have to pay prevailing wage or worry about budgetary constraints. The second is, if we are going to subsidize stupidity, then we need to fund the agency that is in charge of maintaining the structures that keep the XXXXXX alive and dry.",

His office has broad jurisdiction to investigate all Pentagon contracts, both in Iraq and elsewhere . . .\n \n According to the January 5, 1996, Aviation Daily newsletter, Schmitz \"had a number of airline clients in his private practice\" -- and as IG has subsequently refused bipartisan efforts to intervene and terminate a controversial, multi-billion-dollar Pentagon contract with Boeing. The contract would send more than $23 billion in taxpayer funds to the company, yet in return would only be allowed to lease jets, not own them. In fact, even though Schmitz himself admitted the administration \"used inappropriate procurement strategies and did not use best business practices ... to provide sufficient accountability\" for the contract, he claimed there was \"no compelling reason\" to halt the deal.\n \n The American Prospect\n These Dogs Don't Hunt\n July 9, 2004\n \n Schmitz's office on Tuesday released a 256-page report on the investigation [into the Boeing tanker deal], coinciding with a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the matter, considered the largest procurement scandal in decades.

In return we got nothing but scraps of metal.\"\n \n The carefully planned theft has so weakened the army that it cannot hold Baghdad against insurgent attack without American military support, Iraqi officials say, making it difficult for the US to withdraw its 135,000- strong army from Iraq, as Washington says it wishes to do.\n \n Most of the money was supposedly spent buying arms from Poland and Pakistan. The contracts were peculiar in four ways. According to Mr Allawi, they were awarded without bidding, and were signed with a Baghdad-based company, and not directly with the foreign supplier. The money was paid up front, and, surprisingly for Iraq, it was paid at great speed out of the ministry's account with the Central Bank. Military equipment purchased in Poland included 28-year-old Soviet-made helicopters. The manufacturers said they should have been scrapped after 25 years of service. Armoured cars purchased by Iraq turned out to be so poorly made that even a bullet from an elderly AK-47 machine-gun could penetrate their armour. A shipment of the latest MP5 American machine-guns, at a cost of $3,500 (\u00a31,900) each, consisted in reality of Egyptian copies worth only $200 a gun. Other armoured cars leaked so much oil that they had to be abandoned. A deal was struck to buy 7.62mm machine-gun bullets for 16 cents each, although they should have cost between 4 and 6 cents.\n \n Many Iraqi soldiers and police have died because they were not properly equipped. In Baghdad they often ride in civilian pick-up trucks vulnerable to gunfire, rocket- propelled grenades or roadside bombs. For months even men defusing bombs had no protection against blast because they worked without bullet-proof vests. These were often promised but never turned up.\n \n The Iraqi Board of Supreme Audit says in a report to the Iraqi government that US-appointed Iraqi officials in the defence ministry allegedly presided over these dubious transactions.\n \n Senior Iraqi officials now say they cannot understand how, if this is so, the disappearance of almost all the military procurement budget could have passed unnoticed by the US military in Baghdad and civilian advisers working in the defence ministry.\n \n Government officials in Baghdad even suggest that the skill with which the robbery was organised suggests that the Iraqis involved were only front men, and \"rogue elements\" within the US military or intelligence services may have played a decisive role behind the scenes.\n \n Given that building up an Iraqi army to replace American and British troops is a priority for Washington and London, the failure to notice that so much money was being siphoned off at the very least argues a high degree of negligence on the part of US officials and officers in Baghdad.\n \n The report of the Board of Supreme Audit on the defence ministry contracts was presented to the office of Ibrahim al-Jaafari, the Prime Minister, in May. But the extent of the losses has become apparent only gradually. The sum missing was first reported as $300m and then $500m, but in fact it is at least twice as large. \"If you compare the amount that was allegedly stolen of about $1bn compared with the budget of the ministry of defence, it is nearly 100 per cent of the ministry's [procurement] budget that has gone Awol,\" said Mr Allawi.\n \n The money missing from all ministries under the interim Iraqi government appointed by the US in June 2004 may turn out to be close to $2bn. Of a military procurement budget of $1.3bn, some $200m may have been spent on usable equipment, though this is a charitable view, say officials. As a result the Iraqi army has had to rely on cast-offs from the US military, and even these have been slow in coming.\n \n Mr Allawi says a further $500m to $600m has allegedly disappeared from the electricity, transport, interior and other ministries. This helps to explain why the supply of electricity in Baghdad has been so poor since the fall of Saddam Hussein 29 months ago despite claims by the US and subsequent Iraqi governments that they are doing everything to improve power generation.\n \n The sum missing over an eight-month period in 2004 and 2005 is the equivalent of the $1.8bn that Saddam allegedly received in kick- backs under the UN's oil-for-food programme between 1997 and 2003. The UN was pilloried for not stopping this corruption. The US military is likely to be criticised over the latest scandal because it was far better placed than the UN to monitor corruption.\n \n The fraud took place between 28 June 2004 and 28 February this year under the government of Iyad Allawi, who was interim prime minister. His ministers were appointed by the US envoy Robert Blackwell and his UN counterpart, Lakhdar Brahimi.\n \n Among those whom the US promoted was a man who was previously a small businessman in London before the war, called Hazem Shaalan, who became Defence Minister.\n \n Mr Shalaan says that Paul Bremer, then US viceroy in Iraq, signed off the appointment of Ziyad Cattan as the defence ministry's procurement chief. Mr Cattan, of joint Polish-Iraqi nationality, spent 27 years in Europe, returning to Iraq two days before the war in 2003. He was hired by the US-led Coalition Provisional Authority and became a district councillor before moving to the defence ministry.\n \n For eight months the ministry spent money without restraint. Contracts worth more than $5m should have been reviewed by a cabinet committee, but Mr Shalaan asked for and received from the cabinet an exemption for the defence ministry. Missions abroad to acquire arms were generally led by Mr Cattan. Contracts for large sums were short scribbles on a single piece of paper. Auditors have had difficulty working out with whom Iraq has a contract in Pakistan.\n \n Authorities in Baghdad have issued an arrest warrant for Mr Cattan. Neither he nor Mr Shalaan, both believed to be in Jordan, could be reached for further comment. Mr Bremer says he has never heard of Mr Cattan.\n\n \n or this:\n http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/01/30/iraq.audit/\n \nAudit: U.S. lost track of $9 billion in Iraq funds\n Pentagon, Bremer dispute inspector general's report\n \n Monday, January 31, 2005 Posted: 0412 GMT (1212 HKT) \n \n WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Nearly $9 billion of money spent on Iraqi reconstruction is unaccounted for because of inefficiencies and bad management, according to a watchdog report published Sunday.\n \n An inspector general's report said the U.S.-led administration that ran Iraq until June 2004 is unable to account for the funds.\n \n \"Severe inefficiencies and poor management\" by the Coalition Provisional Authority has left auditors with no guarantee the money was properly used,\" the report said.\n \n \"The CPA did not establish or implement sufficient managerial, financial and contractual controls to ensure that [Development Fund for Iraq] funds were used in a transparent manner,\" said Stuart W. Bowen Jr., director of the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction.\n \n The $8.8 billion was reported to have been spent on salaries, operating and capital expenditures, and reconstruction projects between October 2003 and June 2004, Bowen's report concluded.\n \n The money came from revenues from the United Nations' former oil-for-food program, oil sales and seized assets -- all Iraqi money. The audit did not examine the use of U.S. funds appropriated for reconstruction. (Full story)\n \n Auditors were unable to verify that the Iraqi money was spent for its intended purpose. In one case, they raised the possibility that thousands of \"ghost employees\" were on an unnamed ministry's payroll.\n \n \"CPA staff identified at one ministry that although 8,206 guards were on the payroll, only 602 guards could be validated,\" the audit report states. \"Consequently, there was no assurance funds were not provided for ghost employees.\"\n \n The Defense Department, which was in charge of the reconstruction effort, and former Iraq civil administrator Paul Bremer have disputed the findings.\n \n Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told CNN that the provisional authority was operating under \"extraordinary conditions\" and relied on Iraqi ministries to manage development money that was transferred to them.\n \n \"We simply disagree with the audit's conclusion that the CPA provided less-than-adequate controls over Iraqi funds that were provided to Iraqi ministries through the national budget process for hundreds of projects, essential services, Iraqi salaries and security forces,\" Whitman said.\n \n The occupation government established \"major reforms\" in Iraq's budgeting system, setting up a transparent mechanism for decision-making and beginning efforts to fight corruption, Whitman said.\n \n Under a U.N. Security Council resolution, the Development Fund for Iraq was to be used for humanitarian needs, economic reconstruction and repair of infrastructure, continued disarmament, costs of civilian administration and other programs benefiting Iraqis.\n \n Bremer, in a written response included in the report, said Bowen's report failed to recognize the difficulties of operating in wartime.\n \n \"The IG auditors presume that the coalition could achieve a standard of budgetary transparency and execution that even peaceful Western nations would have trouble meeting within a year, especially in the midst of a war,\" Bremer wrote.\n \n Bremer, who received a Presidential Medal of Freedom in December for his work in Iraq, stated that auditors did not interview him, any of his budget directors or deputies in preparing their draft report.\n \n \"On the whole, the office has done excellent work,\" he wrote. \"But I do believe my colleagues at the CPA have a right to expect a level of professional judgment and awareness, which seems to be missing in the current draft report.\"\n \n Bowen's report, which was prepared for Congress, acknowledged that the insurgency in Iraq poses \"the most difficult challenge\" to reconstruction.\n \n \"Even under the most favorable of conditions, rebuilding Iraq would be a job of daunting proportions,\" he wrote.\n \n But the provisional authority did not clearly assign managerial responsibility, and its rules lacked clear guidance on procedures and controls for dispersing funds, he concluded.\n \n Staffing shortages and turnover also resulted in inadequate oversight of budget execution by Iraqi ministries, he found -- and allegations of corruption in the oil-for-food program should have raised concerns about the Iraqi government's ability to manage the reconstruction funds.\n\n \n So what if IGs are watching? They're in Dubya's pocket anyway.\n Even if they do bring up any discrepancies, they'll just be \"discredited\" by people in the administration because they don't understand how difficult it is to keep track of money.",

The complaint charges Safavian with making false statements to a GSA ethics officer and the GSA-OIG, along with obstruction of a GSA-OIG investigation.\n \n The affidavit filed in support of the criminal complaint alleges that from May 16, 2002 until January 10, 2004, Safavian served as Chief of Staff at the GSA. During that time he allegedly aided a Washington D.C. lobbyist in the lobbyist's attempts to acquire GSA-controlled property in and around Washington, D.C. In August 2002, this lobbyist allegedly took Safavian and others on a golf trip to Scotland.\n \n The false statement and obstruction of the investigation charges relate to Safavian's statements to a GSA ethics officer and the GSA-OIG that the lobbyist had no business with GSA prior to the August 2002 golf trip. According to the affidavit, Safavian concealed the fact that the lobbyist had business before GSA prior to the August 2002 golf trip, and that Safavian was aiding the lobbyist in his attempts to do business with GSA\n \n Since Nov. 29, 2004, Safavian has served as the administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy at the Office of Management and Budget.\n \n A complaint is only a charge and is not evidence of guilt. A defendant is entitled to a fair trial in which it will be the government's burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n \n This case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Nathaniel B. Edmonds and Guy D. Singer of the Fraud Section, which is headed by Acting Chief Paul E. Pelletier, and Trial Attorneys Mary K. Butler and M. Kendall Day of the Public Integrity Section, which is headed by Chief Noel L. Hillman. The case is being investigated by Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the General Services Administration Office of Inspector General, the Department of the Interior Office of the Inspector General, and the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n \n http://pogoblog.typepad.com/pogo/2005/09/safavian_the_lo.html\n \n \nAs we noted in the previous post, David Safavian, current head of the powerful Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) and former chief of staff at the General Services Administration, has been arrested. Whether or not Safavian is guilty of the charges against him, he does shares some striking similarities with the disgraced former FEMA chief Mike Brown.\n \n Neither Safavian nor Brown had much relevant professional experience before they received their political appointments. As Government Executive wrote last summer about Safavian:\n \n \"He doesn't have a lot of background in procurement, so the hope is that he's a good learner,\" says Steven Kelman, who served as federal procurement administrator in the Clinton administration. \"I don't know where David Safavian comes out on [acquisition reform],\" says Allan Burman, another former procurement chief. Angela Styles, who held the top acquisition post until last September, says Safavian has \"no apparent philosophy\" on procurement issues.\n \n What Safavian did have plenty of was lobbying experience and political connections. His arrest stems from a charge that he engaged in obstructing a General Services Administration (GSA) Inspector General investigation. From a Justice Department press release today:\n \n The affidavit filed in support of the criminal complaint alleges that from May 16, 2002 until January 10, 2004, Safavian served as Chief of Staff at the GSA. During that time he allegedly aided a Washington D.C. lobbyist in the lobbyist's attempts to acquire GSA-controlled property in and around Washington, D.C. In August 2002, this lobbyist allegedly took Safavian and others on a golf trip to Scotland.\n \n The false statement and obstruction of the investigation charges relate to Safavian's statements to a GSA ethics officer and the GSA-OIG that the lobbyist had no business with GSA prior to the August 2002 golf trip. According to the affidavit, Safavian concealed the fact that the lobbyist had business before GSA prior to the August 2002 golf trip, and that Safavian was aiding the lobbyist in his attempts to do business with GSA.\n \n The Justice Department press release never names the \"lobbyist\" since the investigation is ongoing. The investigation is across the multiple agencies-- the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the General Services Administration Office of Inspector General, the Department of the Interior Office of the Inspector General, and the Internal Revenue Service. But it's likely that scandal-ridden Jack Abramoff is the lobbyist in question.\n \n Safavian and Abramoff have numerous ties, as this Raw Story article explores. A few of these connections:\n \n *\n \"Abramoff schooled Safavian at Preston, Gates & Ellis where they jointly represented a broad swath of gambling interests work now being probed by federal investigators.\"\n *\n \"Safavian went on to found lobby shop Janus Merritt with Abramoff's college roommate and conservative maverick Grover Norquist [ed. note--Norquist is famous for his extremist quote, \"I don't want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.\"]. At Janus, he represented an array of Internet gambling firms, many of whom Abramoff would later serve.\"\n \n The Senate Office of Public Records has Safavian's lobby filing forms online (here are Abramoff's). Besides representing numerous Indian gaming interests involved in scandals, Safavian and Abramoff both had Shaw Environmental and Infrastructure (part of the Shaw Group) as a client, which is now represented by former FEMA chief and 2000 Bush-Cheney campaign manager Joe Allbaugh. (Shaw is now winning post-Katrina reconstruction contracts (pdf).)\n\n \n And I just love the name Jack Abramoff.\n It's not as good as Norman Mineta (mineta means performing oral sex on a woman in a few slavic languages) but it'll do.\n \n http://www.govexec.com/features/0604-15/0604-15newsanalysis4.htm",

DI RITA: You know -- it's Larry DiRita -- I think what people are interested in, if you know, is when specifically or if indeed did the governors specifically ask for additional security forces and when that might have been? And if you don't know that, we'll try and find it, but that would be -- I think that's a little more refined aspect of what the reporter's asking for.\n \n \n GEN. HONOR\u00c9: Yeah, that was incremental. The security force piece was executed through a process called EMAC. That started on Sunday, a collaboration between the adjutant general and the National Guard Bureau to flow additional capabilities to Louisiana and to Mississippi. That flow started approximately around Sunday. Forces started moving once the eye of the hurricane had passed and we could start moving forces in and assist the states, Alabama pushed forces into Mississippi as well as forces from Texas started to flow into Louisiana, as well as other states. But that's the approximate phase of the operation. Again, that was executed through National Guard arrangements to move National Guard capability where it's needed. And that is what is happening, an extension of that, now. \n \n The DOD capability was based on requests that came from FEMA for additional ability to assist in search and rescue, and that was called a mission assignment. Those started on Sunday. And we were here on Sunday, and by Monday, the Bataan was present, as well as federal helicopters started arriving Monday to assist in the search and rescue and the sustainment operation, that that is the timeline as it was executed in the process. \n\n \n Now I wonder why Blanco had to ask a second time on Wednesday.",

Mr Bush has now overseen the fastest increase in domestic spending of any president in recent history. Furthermore, he has never resolved the inherent contradiction between his so-called \"compassionate\" spending policy and his small-government tax policy (which was ostensibly designed to \"kill the beast\" of Big Government once and for all, according to the President's conservative apologists). And his casual dismissal of the remnants of civilian authority in the Gulf basin - \"It is now clear that a challenge on this scale requires greater federal authority and a broader role for the armed forces -- the institution of our government most capable of massive logistical operations on a moment's notice\" - evokes something more along the lines of Mussolini-style fascism than any coherent, mainstream conservative, philosophy.\n \n\n \n Wow, he noticed that Bush was closer to fascism than conservatism too!",
