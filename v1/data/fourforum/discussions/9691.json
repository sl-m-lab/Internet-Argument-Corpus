Call it civil unions but then the marriage license must be retitled to cilvil union for heteros.",

   "You just contradicted yourself. On one hand you say they don't have those things, and then two sentences later you basically assert that 10% of them are that way (even though that wasn't your intention). Even one would be over-the-top.\n \n\n What you said:\n \"parades had the over-the-top focus on sexual behavior?\"\n In point of fact I contradicted your concept of over-the-top focus, not myself. If you think 10% of the people wearing chaps is a focus on sex then that's your special definition, but I don't share it.\n \n \n\n Well of course they make it into the paper. When people are doing that in plain sight in front of kids or whoever, it's naturally going to make the news.\n\n Doing \"that\". What is it you think they're doing, anyway? You do realize that these parades have to follow all local decency laws, don't you? Some people may be in leather or scantily clad, but it's not like their naked or having sex or anything. You really haven't ever actually seen one of these, have you? You're not basing this on anything other than what you've been fed, am I right?\n \n \n\n And I don't see why parade organizers wouldn't want to be selective in who they let march. But hey, it's their parade, and their movement. If they want to give everyone the wrong impression, whatever.\n\n I think it's more a case of those who want the wrong impression are going to get it anyway. 1 in 10, 1 in 100, or one guy in the crowd. If that picture was the one that made it into the papers, those who were looking for a reason to disapprove would have it. And as for being selective, the movement is about equality and acceptance. Being exclusive would be a bit contradictory, don't you think? \n \n \n\n And so I said nothing to the effect of having a problem with them wanting social acceptance. You're jumping to conclusions.\n\n I'm reading what you wrote and drawing conclusions from that, yes. Again, what you said is \"See, I'd have less of a problem with the gay pride movement if it had been limited to it's legal battles, but it hasn't.\" Sticking to legal battles means not working on social acceptance, seeing as how they're different things and all.
