Even if people were shocked (like in some of these studies) that doesn't prove that a person who owns a gun is more likely to kill someone. All that proves is a normal person gets angry. Also if owning a gun makes you more likely to kill someone, why haven't 150 million people in the US killed or hurt someone with it? 30 thou (estimated number of murders a year)/ 150 mill (estimated number of people who own guns)=.0002% Not a big number of people do.",

To quote the post:\n Guns are used to threaten and intimidate far more often than they are used in self defense. Most self reported self defense gun uses may well be illegal and against the interests of society.\n we find that criminal gun use is far more common than self-defense gun use. This result is consistent with findings from other private surveys and the National Crime Victimization Surveys\n Firearm self-defense is rare compared with gun crimes.\n A minority of home invasion crimes result in injury. Measures that increase the difficulty of forced entry or enhance the likelihood of detection could be useful to prevent these crimes. Although firearms are often kept in the home for protection, they are rarely used for this purpose.\n \n Looking back over the topic, I'm fairly sure that those were the only two themes of questions directed at me.

   "Ian-\n \n If this belief that simply being in the same room as a gun will induce aggressive and dangerous sensations in an individual, possibly forcing them to act on uncontrollable impulses to commit harm to others, how exactly do you explain the fact that the police aren't regularly dragging drivers from their cars and beating, tasering and gassing them for whatever incident might occur?\n \n The theory of firearms acting as kerosene in the same way violence is a fire, fails when we confront it with everyday life.

If that were the case then what about detectives who operate in plain clothes? Since they don't have a uniform, their badges hidden in pockets, and thus no constant visible reminder of their status as a LEO, wouldn't that mean they're less likely to be inhibited towards aggressive acts?\n \n \nYou claim that there is no scientific evidence for the fact that guns trigger aggression. You claim this on the grounds that you have 'scientific' evidence that disproves it - that the police do not appear to be affected by their firearms.\n\n \n I disbelieve the entire argument because to me it's scientifically unsound. I can understand how drugs could affect behavior because I know a little something about chemistry, about how each of the components will work when metabolized and broken down in the body. I can understand how mob mentality will influence a person to do things they wouldn't normally do when they're by themselves. What I can't understand is how simply being in the same room as a piece of metal would be enough to induce hostilities and aggression is a person who isn't naturally predisposed towards aggressive behavior in the first place; there has to be something else to it other than the gun/no gun thing.\n \n \nHowever, your evidence is far from scientific. In order for it to be scientific, you would need to compare the behaviour of US police with guns to the behaviour of US police without guns - at the moment, all you have done is (falsely) state that 'increaced aggression' means 'beating innocent bystanders into a bloody coma' and then picked a group of people who are a definite subset of 'standard' gun owners in order to make a comparison with the general public - like I said in my earlier post, this is like comparing blonde children to redhead undergraduates.\n\n \n Alright let's make a comparison between police and \"normal\" gun owners. Unlike the rest of us, police receive training in firearms handling, in shooting at others, in dealing with violent people and stopping them effectively; it could be argued that police are trained for the purpose of killing bad guys, but that training doesn't seem to leak over and encourage violence against other people.\n \n \nFurthermore, my (multiple) sources still are scientific evidence. In controlled conditions, where nothing changes but for the presence of a firearm (unlike in your example), a definite correlation has been shown.\n\n \n I still find your evidence lacking, as there has to be some sort of trigger to violent tendencies. The argument of \"guns encourage violent acts\" would suggest that, if scientifically possible, you could take a Comanche indian from 100 years before the pilgrims landed, hand him Ruger's new SR9 pistol without showing him how it performed or what it could do, and he would be more likely to be hostile and aggressive towards other than any other Comanche at the time.\n \n No, I don't buy it, there's something else to it. Who were the people involved in these studies? Were they poor people from the ghettos where shootings and drug dealings and killing and violence in general were seen as accepted social norms for dealing with problems? Were they well adjusted individuals who were middle class or above and had good jobs and lived in good neighborhoods? What was their upbringing like? What was their prior knowledge of guns? What was their prior experience with guns? How many of them had substance abuse problems and were struggling to feed a habit? How many did jail time? How many had clean mental health? How many of them grew up watching movies of Sylvester Stallone mowing down people with automatic gunfire, and movies where gangbangers has MAC-10s and bazookas? How many of them only knew what they saw in movies and took it as the facts? \n \n What exactly are all the relevant details? These questions and more need to be answered, simply doing the \"gun/no gun\" thing doesn't work because it ignores vitally important information that could have a bearing on the outcome.\n \n In my experience the largest hot spots for firearms-related violence are in the big cities. Big cities with much liberal influence, big cities with various gun control laws that don't extend to the rural areas, big cities where parents don't speak of guns to their children, big cities where the only thing children know about guns is what they see in movies where a pistol can blow a car to smithereens, or an M-16 can fire thousands of rounds from a single magazine and never run out.\n \n To me the answer isn't that the presence of a gun encourages violent behavior, what truly encourages the violent behavior is what's being pumped into the minds of young individuals and not counterbalanced with proper learning and parental intervention.",

   "In that case, I suggest you go away and read the links that I have provided to you. My apologies - I assumed that you had at least skimmed them\n \n The general theme developed is one of contextual linking. Individuals associate guns with violence due to exposure to the media and the general uses of guns - one of the sources reports that the effect is lessened in hunters, because they do not associate guns with human-to-human violence as readily. On sensing the presence of the gun (or even a picture of a gun, in cases (again, see the sources)), this cue acts to 'remind' the individual of the violence that they perceive to be linked to the weapon, making them more aggressive. An analogy would be some phobias - people are afraid of apparently harmless objects because they associate a fear-causing situation with that object, just as seeing a gun causes someone to become more aggressive because they associate aggressiveness with the weapon.\n \n As such, a police uniform (potentially, I have no evidence beyond this reasoning) acts as a countering visual influence - it is a visual reminder of the officer's training and serves to link them to the rational thought and behaviour that they contextually link to the uniform.

[JAMA. 1995] - PubMed Result\n \n OBJECTIVE--To study the epidemiology of home invasion crimes and determine the frequency with which firearms are used to resist these crimes. DESIGN--Prospective case series. SETTING--Atlanta, Ga (population 402,877). METHODS--Between June 1 and August 31, 1994; Atlanta Police Department reports were screened to identify every case of unwanted entry into an occupied, single-family dwelling. Cases of sexual assault and incidents that involved cohabitants were excluded. RESULTS--A total of 198 cases were identified during the study interval. Half (99 cases) involved forced entry into the home. The victim and offender were acquainted in one third of cases. A firearm was carried by one or more offenders in 32 cases (17%). Seven offenders (3.5%) carried knives. In 42% of cases, the offender fled without confronting the victim. Victims who avoided confrontation were more likely to lose property but much less likely to be injured than those who were confronted by the offender. Resistance was attempted in 62 cases (31%), but the odds of injury were not significantly affected by the method of resistance. Forty cases (20%) resulted in one or more victims' being injured, including six (3%) who were shot. No one died. Three victims (1.5%) employed a firearm in self-protection. All three escaped injury, but one lost property. CONCLUSION--A minority of home invasion crimes result in injury. Measures that increase the difficulty of forced entry or enhance the likelihood of detection could be useful to prevent these crimes. Although firearms are often kept in the home for protection, they are rarely used for this purpose.\n \n What does this show? It shows criminals use guns in the commission of their crimes, we already know this.\n \n The incidence of defensive firearm use by US crime...[Am J Public Health. 1994] - PubMed Result\n \n It is well known that many crimes in the United States are committed with firearms. Less adequately documented is the frequency with which victims use guns in self-defense. We used National Crime Victimization Survey data to examine incidents where victims employed guns against offenders. Between 1987 and 1990 there were an estimated 258,460 incidents of firearm defense, an annual mean of 64,615. Victims used firearms in 0.18% of all crimes recorded by the survey and in 0.83% of violent offenses. Firearm self-defense is rare compared with gun crimes.\n \n What does this suggest? To me it looks like a biased attempt to show that guns are overwhelming used exclusively for evil and criminal purposes and that society would benefit most from a ban on gun ownership.\n \n The relative frequency of offensive and defensive ...[Violence Vict. 2000] - PubMed Result\n \n Some controversy exists about the relative frequency of criminal and self-defense gun use in the United States. Using data from a national random-digit-dial telephone survey of over 1,900 adults conducted in 1996, we find that criminal gun use is far more common than self-defense gun use. This result is consistent with findings from other private surveys and the National Crime Victimization Surveys. In this survey, all reported cases of criminal gun use and many cases of self-defense gun use appear to be socially undesirable. There are many instances of gun use, often for intimidation, that are not reported to the police and may not appear in official crime statistics.\n \n What does this suggest? Again, another biased opinion that banning guns would be in the best interest of society.\n \n Gun use in the United States: results from two nat...[Inj Prev. 2000] - PubMed Result\n \n OBJECTIVES: To determine the relative incidence of gun victimization versus self defense gun use by civilians in the United States, and the circumstances and probable legality of the self defense uses. METHODS: National random digit dial telephone surveys of the adult population were conducted in 1996 and 1999. The Harvard surveys appear unique among private surveys in two respects: asking (1) open ended questions about defensive gun use incidents and (2) detailed questions about both gun victimization and self defense gun use. Five criminal court judges were asked to assess whether the self reported defensive gun uses were likely to have been legal. RESULTS: Even after excluding many reported firearm victimizations, far more survey respondents report having been threatened or intimidated with a gun than having used a gun to protect themselves. A majority of the reported self defense gun uses were rated as probably illegal by a majority of judges. This was so even under the assumption that the respondent had a permit to own and carry the gun, and that the respondent had described the event honestly. CONCLUSIONS: Guns are used to threaten and intimidate far more often than they are used in self defense. Most self reported self defense gun uses may well be illegal and against the interests of society.\n \n Two things. First, it suggests that the one who get victimized the most are the one who are unarmed, as they were without a gun to defend themselves with.\n \n Second, the article states right there that they feel self-defense is against the interests of society, meaning that it's a biased opinion piece.\n \n I've gone over all four of these pieces, and nowhere in it did I find anything comparable to the points I raised in my previous post. Exactly what were the backgrounds of those involved in the study? Who committed the criminal acts and what histories did they have that would influence the way things happened? \n \n I'll ask again: Who were the people involved in these studies? Were they poor people from the ghettos where shootings and drug dealings and killing and violence in general were seen as accepted social norms for dealing with problems? Were they well adjusted individuals who were middle class or above and had good jobs and lived in good neighborhoods? What was their upbringing like? What was their prior knowledge of guns? What was their prior experience with guns? How many of them had substance abuse problems and were struggling to feed a habit? How many did jail time? How many had clean mental health? How many of them grew up watching movies of Sylvester Stallone mowing down people with automatic gunfire, and movies where gangbangers has MAC-10s and bazookas? How many of them only knew what they saw in movies and took it as the facts?\n \n \nThe general theme developed is one of contextual linking. Individuals associate guns with violence due to exposure to the media and the general uses of guns - one of the sources reports that the effect is lessened in hunters, because they do not associate guns with human-to-human violence as readily. On sensing the presence of the gun (or even a picture of a gun, in cases (again, see the sources)), this cue acts to 'remind' the individual of the violence that they perceive to be linked to the weapon, making them more aggressive. An analogy would be some phobias - people are afraid of apparently harmless objects because they associate a fear-causing situation with that object, just as seeing a gun causes someone to become more aggressive because they associate aggressiveness with the weapon.\n\n \n I saw no such link in those four paragraphs that you cite.\n \n \nAs such, a police uniform (potentially, I have no evidence beyond this reasoning) acts as a countering visual influence - it is a visual reminder of the officer's training and serves to link them to the rational thought and behaviour that they contextually link to the uniform.\n\n \n This doesn't explain how mere clothes serve as an effective restraint against a cop going rogue and unleashing acts of violence against innocent bystanders simply because they're armed. Nor does it explain why plain clothes detectives display no such restraint.\n \n \nA cop's training is not to 'encourage them to beat up the bad guys', it is to encourage them to rationally evaluate the situation and act accordingly, without allowing for irrational instinctive responses, such as the firearms/aggression trigger. As such, cops are a bad choice for comparison, because they have competing influences compared to the average civilian.\n\n \n No, you never said anything about training, you never made that argument. All you said was that being in the presence of a gun will trigger aggressive tendencies in an individual. You didn't mention mitigating circumstances, you didn't suggest anything except the flawed logic of guns inducing aggression and anger in a blanket effect.\n \n \nI am not blaming the guns for somehow mystically brainwashing people into violence. Instead, I'm saying that the gun acts as a trigger to more aggressive behaviour.\n\n \n And what instills that behavior and makes it possible to actually be triggered?\n \n \nWith regards to 'the true cause' of violent behaviour - I'd say that all links in the chain are culpable - both media and gun ownership included. However, the fact that the gun is a link in the chain is not a fact you can ignore.\n\n \n At the very most the gun is nothing more than one link in a chain, and it's far from being the most important link that holds everything together. At the best it's as tied to the issue as a sneeze is to a cold; just one of many symptoms. And just like with a cold or the flu, focusing exclusively on the symptoms and treating them doesn't make the disease go away, it just covers it up; like a wig on a bald head.",

   "OK...\n \n Now go and read the relevant links - the ones I provided you on the \"consensus that guns fuel violence\". Not the links on the fact that gun self-defence is rare compared to gun crime. \n \n You're looking at the wrong links.\n \n I can go over those ones as well if you want (in fact, I probably should in a different topic, as you're making some glaring errors) - but at the moment, it's nothing but sidetracking from the 'inducing aggressiveness' discussion.\n \n As far as I can see, there are three components to this 'chain'. Media linking guns and violence, reality linking guns and violence, and guns triggering the link. Ultimately, I agree that getting rid of the first two links would be a good thing... but for now, that third one is the only one which can be removed (and even then, with extreme caution).",
