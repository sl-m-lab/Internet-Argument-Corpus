   "I was reading an article in the most recent Time magazine today about the \"civil war\" Islam. It started out with a story of a father who lives in Baghdad, and decided to send his son to school in the UAE to escape Saddam's oppression. His son attended a school where he studied automotive maintenance. The family was a very Western family; they didn't wear traditional Muslim garments, his father smoked, and the son regularly attended parties. However, the father started to wonder about his son when the son began to write letters home chiding his father's smoking and his mother wearing Western clothes to work. When his once clean-shaven son returned home after the fall of Saddam's regime, he had a long beard and his disdasha (traditional Islamic gown) was several inches short of the floor. His father knew these were trademarks of Islamic fundamentalists. The son then began to tell him father how the United States was the \"enemy\" of Islam.\n \n \n Time also tells of a British Pakistani who was a former spokesman for al-Muhajiroun, an extremist group based in Britain. He claims, \"I would fit into being called a radical, and one day, God willing, even to be called a terrorist, if Allah permits me. This is something it would be an honor to be called.\"\n \n \n I just point out these 2 instances to show how many Islamic extremists are putting a bad name on the Islamic religion. They claim that their god, Allah, permits them to remove infidels and even behead them. However, religious scholars say that the Islamic religion condemns this kind of violence in the name of religion. The basic texts of the faith never sanction the wanton murder of civlians, which extremists believe they were brought on this planet to do. When you have people out there who claim that they are inspired by their religion to murder Americans because they are the enemy, you have a problem. I just felt that Time had a really good report and wanted to see what everyone has to say about this issue.",

   "This is a growing trend, Famous Amos. I see no way of stopping it's growth...not from my standpoint anyway. Once you have an established way of life, one that instills \"honor\" (loosely used here) by doing those harm that oppose that belief/way of life, then you have what I call the New Ishmaels. It is not meant in a discriminatory fashion, but as a means to explain their hatred of all things non-Muslim.\n For example, they see the United States as a bully, a country where killing unborn children is okay, where the freedom to become a legitimate hooker is as paramount as becoming a kindergarten teacher, where lawyers are the law, where the OJ Simpson&#8217;s and Scott Peterson&#8217;s become celebrities, where a person&#8217;s skin color denotes whether he is good or bad&#8230;they see this country spreading that &#8220;filth&#8221; all over them and their own after being subjugated by it. It is and will be an honor for them to kill and be killed to destroy the American Monster, the Infidels.\n And, I&#8217;m afraid they&#8217;ve only just begun. These older, more experienced murderers/terrorists are their heroes, because to them we are the murderers/terrorists.\n \n It echoes the sentiments, &#8220;Know thine enemy.&#8221;",

Do you think that American Christians would kill said Muslims if they were threatening their way of life and possibly their freedom? OF COURSE THEY WOULD.\n \n George Bush himself said that God told him going to war was the right thing to do, to \"preserve what he believes in\". How is that different than a muslim using the Koran to support doing whatever he can do to \"preserve what he believes in\"? They have fundamentalist clerics, we have Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson.
