   "Scientists say that gravity compared to electromagnetic pulses is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times weaker as far as attraction goes. We have magnets that can lift objects off the ground that are nowhere near the size of the earth. Even with the mass of the earth, the gravity is easily defeated by tiny magnets. The explanation I heard telling why the vast difference related to String Theory. It said that there were many universes. In our universe, electromagnetic force is very strong but can only affect our universe. Gravity on the other hand traverses many universes. Imagine our universe as a sheet of paper. EM force can only affect what is drawn on that piece of paper. Now imagine a stack of papers as many universes. Gravity originating from our universe can affect the entire stack of papers making it affect more dimensions. This reduces gravity's overall effect on our universe but it is theorized to be equally as strong as EM, just disbursed differently. Does anyone have any other explanations for why gravity is such a weak force? Or can someone explain to me why gravity can transcend our universe but not EM? I only know the minor basics of this theory and I would be interested to learn more about it if anyone knows.",

There are opposite magnetic poles (i.e. no magnetic monopoles). These therefore can get \"cancelled.\"\n There is no opposite of gravity. It cannot get \"cancelled.\" If it were as strong as these other constants, gravity's effect would dwarf the effects of others.\n \n But of course, here's my take:\n Why is the charge of an electron &#8722;1.602 \u00d7 10^&#8722;19 C?
