Also I think you believe in the virgin so that might be a problem but you can just say so if it is.\n\n Hank and Richard - it would be a pleasure. I truly have no problem with who wins this debate or which points are raised. I shall make no secret that I believe in the virgin birth, but the \"winner\" of this debate will be the person who adheres to debate standards the best, raises points adequately and can appropriately present their argument. I think I can efficiently make an objective decision, and there shouldn't be any worry of me inflicting bias on my final decision. \n \n Hank- as for your debaticle in the past - I thought it was reasonably efficient, we didn't have any ad hominems flying about and it only gained you my respect, and plus, I certainly learned a lot. ;)\n \n I highlighted a few tips and possible guidelines for a decent debate here:\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=31709&postcount=5\n There is also a few good other links on what makes an efficient debater.\n \n If you two have a set of rules that you will want me to make my decision on, then you can present them, otherwise I'll just go by the ordinary way of things.\n \n I think it's a good idea for the first poster to post last, since really - they're at quite a disadvantage. Any ideas on a post number? Seven for the person who begins and six for the second? If you're both ready, then let it begin!",

   "Dreamweaver,\n These rules that you mention sound appropriate, although I would like to point out that you and I might have different idea of what is scriptural, i.e. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Jehovah is the almighty one and Jesus is the firstborn creation by God. I may well not go into full explanation of this fact in the debate but this does not mean it's not sound argument. A full explanation is available if you so wish.\n I feel that Hank should begin the debate, as he is the one against the only account of the virgin birth, the Bible.\n 'Supernatural' means beyond human science, as does 'paranormal' and closely related words.\n I'm not sure how long this debate should last, it's a potentially huge subject, and some agreement must be reached.\n Time between posts is also something Hank has mentioned because it's a busy time of the year for him. He said about one every week which is cool with me if he's still in agreement. Although what is meant, one each or one between us each week?\n There's been no specification of length of posts; again I say it's a huge subject potentially. We need agreement on this also.\n My main source is the worlds biggest and best Biblical reference library published by 'The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society', and I permit no handicap of this.\n Starting whenever these things above have been agreed.\n \n Hank, \n Be gentle with me!",

   "\n Hank, \n Be gentle with me!\n\n \n LOL. You seem very intelligent to me and I have no doubt you will present your case well.\n \n I have the following proposals.\n \n 1. Since I am opposed to one person having more post than the other, I propose that I take heads and Dreamweaver flips a coin. If it is heads, I get to choose whether I go first or second and if it is tails that Richard gets the same choice.\n \n 2. Since the person that post last has the opportunity to take advantage of a discourse, I propose that the last post be limited to rebuttal of the next to last post. In other words, no new issues may be raised in the last post.\n \n 3. Each post must be posted by Sunday night at 12 for the person&#8217;s time zone. My time zone is central. If either person is ready to post before that time then fine.\n \n 4. The first post be made by Sunday, February 22. Like I said, I need a little time to brush up on the subject if that&#8217;s all right. The next post in response would be made no later than the following Sunday night.\n \n 5. We agree to make seven post each unless we all three agree to change the number during the debate.\n \n Dreamweaver I noticed you are having the same debate with Potter about what is considered evidence as you had with me. I have to say I am uncomfortable with your definition of evidence, especially in a debate of this nature. I am also uncomfortable with you believing in the virgin birth which is of course the position I will be opposing. However I have to assume that you will be fair in your judgements so I will take you at your word that neither of these will influence your judgement. I have seen you are opinionated but you appear to be fair in the debates I have seen you participate in.\n \n Richard and Dreamweaver I will be having some surgery on March 25 and may request an extension of time for that week. I also am sometimes, but not often, called away on business. I may request an extension if that happens. I would think this would not be a problem as we are doing this for fun and entertainment.\n \n Okay let me know what you guys thing.\n \n Hank",

   "Affirmative post 1. 1) Science: \n There are many, including numerous scientists and religious leaders who would abruptly conclude that miracles are not true, but it is not logically valid to use science as an argument against miracles. To believe that miracles cannot happen is as much an act of faith as to believe that they can happen, you would have to put faith in the belief that humans cannot and indeed NEVER can achieve such things, dangerous ground. Miracles are unprecedented events, but it doesn't mean they're not possible (eventually).\n \n 2) Bible: \n i) The very prophecy of the virgin birth is found at Isaiah 7:14. which says: \"Listen, please, O house of David. . . . Jehovah himself will give you men a sign: Look! The maiden herself will actually become pregnant, and she is giving birth to a son, and she will certainly call his name Immanuel.\"\n Some have suggested that in the type back there \"Immanuel\" was a third son of Isaiah, perhaps by a Jewish maiden who may have become a second wife of the prophet, which may well possibly be the case. What we have to remember is that prophecy in the Bible may have an initial fulfillment and then be defined latter on, which was the case with this one. Also take into account that Isaiah said his sons were to serve \"as signs and as miracles in Israel\" then this would prove the case. Isaiah 8:19. \n Following from 'insight on the scriptures' (WBTS) \n The full and complete identity of Immanuel, of course, is found in the office and personage of the Lord Jesus Christ. The use, therefore, of the Hebrew word `al\u00b7mah' in the prophecy would accommodate both the type (if such was a young wife of Ahaz or of Isaiah) and the antitype (the betrothed and yet virgin Mary). In the case of Mary there was no question about her being a virgin when she became \"pregnant by holy spirit,\" both Matthew and Luke recording this historical fact. (Mt 1:18-25; Lu 1:30-35) \"All this actually came about for that to be fulfilled which was spoken by Jehovah through his prophet,\" Matthew observed. It was a sign that identified the long-awaited Messiah. So in keeping with these facts, Matthew's Gospel (quoting Isa 7:14) uses the Greek word par\u00b7the'nos, meaning \"virgin,\" to translate `al\u00b7mah', saying: \"Look! The virgin [par\u00b7the'nos] will become pregnant and will give birth to a son, and they will call his name Immanuel.\" (Mt 1:22, 23) In no way was this taking liberties or distorting the text. Over a century earlier, the Jewish translators of the Greek Septuagint had also used par\u00b7the'nos in rendering Isaiah 7:14.\n \n Matthew and Luke.\n ii) In Matthews genealogy at verse 16 it halts from it course and says \"Jacob became farther to Joseph the husband of Mary of whom Jesus was born,\" not giving natural fatherhood to Joseph but indicating that he was to be an adoptive father. In Luke's genealogy also a reluctance of affirming natural fatherhood to Joseph is expressed, it simply says \"Jesus...being the son as the opinion was, of Joseph,\" \n There should be no reason to suggest that Mark and John's gospels also should mention the fact of Mary's virginity at the conception of Jesus simply because if we read at John 8:17 it says \"Also in your own law it is written, 'The witness of two men is true.'\" So no more is required.\n \n Other Writers. \n iii) Also because of this fact there is no need for constantly referring directly to the Virgin Birth in the rest of the inspired scriptures. Paul and the other writers however did constantly assert that Mary needed to be a virgin in an indirect yet conclusive way. Paul mentions at Galatians 4:4 that \"God sent forth HIS son who came to be out of woman and who came to be under law, that he might release by purchase those under law,\"\n \n Law Requirements. \n iv) The \"release by purchase\" here evidently means the ransom price paid by Jesus when he presented the value of his right to life on earth to Jehovah to buy back mankind from enslavement to sin. There had to be a match between Adam's perfect body and the perfect body of Jesus for justice to be met, this is simply laid out in the law given by Jehovah which clearly says \"soul will be for soul, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.\" Deut. 19:21, Adam died in perfect sin so Jesus needed to die in perfect obedience (Romans 5:18,19), if Jesus was born of two humans this would mean that he would have been just as imperfect as the rest of us and no balance would ever be achieved on Jehovah's scales of justice, therefore no release, no promise, no salvation, no hope. \n \n v) Jesus still had to be born through the present human family, he couldn't have just been created from scratch like Adam because this wouldn't prove a thing about the obedience of the existing human family. Satan had proven in a sense that Jehovah's original creation was flawed (Proverbs 27:11), so Jesus had to be part of the same family as Adam. If not, again! No Justice! \n \n vi) In order for Mary not to be ashamed or something more gruesome, an adoptive father was needed who can convey to the child the legal right to King David's throne. Both Joseph and Mary belong to the tribe of Judah and are descendants of King David. So the heirship rights of Jesus will be doubly established. (Matthew 1:2-16; Luke 3:23-33) This is why the angel later assures Joseph that he should not hesitate to take Mary as his legal wife, although she is pregnant. -Matthew 1:19-25. \n \n vii) Jehovah also selected a virgin to prove that Jesus was really his son, if Mary had already been married and had sexual intercourse with a man then the identity of Jesus would have always been doubted, even more than it already is!\n \n In summary:\n 1) 'Science of the day' is not the same as 'science of tomorrow' you need lots and lots of faith to believe that science won't one day prove a 'Virgin Birth' possible. \n 2) The Fact of the Virgin Birth is essential to the Christian faith, if it's removed then so is all hope of peace on earth through the sacrifice of God's son Jesus, and the whole of the 'New Testament' would implode.\n \n For these reasons I affirm that Jesus was indeed born of a Virgin woman.\n \n Richard,",

   "I know thousands have anxiously awaited the start of this debate but I would like to take one more moment before starting to thank my opponent Richard and especially Dreamweaver as judge for taking their time to participate. I know this can be time consuming and does take time away from other activities. I would also like to say that I do not mean to ridicule anyone's religion or beliefs but to simply discuss the different viewpoints of this important subject.\n \n In addition I would like to point out the somewhat obvious. Many of the arguments I will use are not original thinking on my part. This has been debated since the subject first came into existence. Therefore many of my posts will be based on material that others have already discussed. I will not post references to that material as it is information that I don't even remember where I first heard it. So although it is not my intent to plagiarize someone else's thinking, I will often be doing just that.\n \n Richard has produced a through and well thought out first post that covers a large scope of the subject. So large in fact that it will be impossible to adequately address all of his points in a single post. Therefore I will be using my next 7 posts to address his points, as well as bring in points of my own. For that reason, I will not reproduce his entire post with replies to each part at this time. For my first post I will address only his summary and the issues he has raised with regard to the theology he has presented from the Bible. I will add that I did not intend to raise the science issue but since he has introduced the subject, I will be using one of my later posts to address the scientific issues at length. \n \n \nIn summary:\n \n 1) 'Science of the day' is not the same as 'science of tomorrow' you need lots and lots of faith to believe that science won't one day prove a 'Virgin Birth' possible. \n\n \n I do not see where you have presented an argument for the virgin birth in the science portion of your post. In fact you admit that science does not support the miracle of a virgin birth. Your hope is that science will someday prove the possibility of a virgin birth. Of course should science in the future show that a virgin birth is possible, that in no way gives credence to the belief that Jesus was born of a virgin birth, only that it would be scientifically possible. But as stated above, I will return to the subject of scientific evidence at a later time.\n \n \n2) The Fact of the Virgin Birth is essential to the Christian faith, if it's removed then so is all hope of peace on earth through the sacrifice of God's son Jesus, and the whole of the 'New Testament' would implode.\n \n\n \n Your second point basically argues from the perspective that it must be true because if not, your belief and the belief of many others would be wrong. Although I can sympathize with your dilemma, this is hardly a convincing argument. The truth of the virgin birth will, and should, stand on the facts, regardless of how many people would be disappointed if the truth goes against their beliefs.\n \n But in any case, I would disagree that the dire results you predict would actually happen. The value of Jesus' existence is his life, death and resurrection, not whether he was born of a virgin or not. Although it is probably true that fundamentalist Christians would be devastated, there are millions of Christians today that are inspired and uplifted by the life and teachings of Jesus that do not believe in the virgin birth. I would compare this to the 17th century Christian theology that the earth was the center of the universe. Because there were verses from the Bible used to support the earth-centered universe, there were calamitous predictions of the fall of Christianity because the Bible would not be true if it turned out that the earth was not the center of the universe. Somehow the church has survived and prospered just fine even though there is overwhelming evidence that the earth is no longer the center of the universe.\n \n Therefore I submit that neither of your points are valid in supporting the virgin birth.\n \n With that said, I will present my first argument.\n \n The Argument from a Theological Basis\n \n This post will look at the theology that requires the virgin birth and point out why it is a misinterpretation of scripture. Although I will use the Bible as the reference, this does not mean I believe the Bible is the inerrant word of God, but simply the basis of the concept behind the theology.\n \n For purposes of this debate, I will define 'virgin birth' as the birth of a child that was not conceived with human male sperm. I am open to another definition if my opponent prefers but this definition should suffice for starters.\n \n Christianity uses ideas from the ancient Hebrew text as their justification for the necessity of the virgin birth. These ideas are woven into the general theology as follows:\n \n 1. Adam, the first man sinned by eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\n 2. That act caused sin to enter the world for all mankind.\n 3. God required a blood sacrifice to appease his displeasure with this act.\n 4. The sacrifice must be from the best animals.\n 5. By default, every man was guilty of sin so the sacrifice was required for every person (meaning males at the time).\n 6. Sin is passed from generation to generation via the male.\n 7. The virgin birth was required so that sin would not be transmitted into the body that the person of Jesus would reside in.\n \n But what does the first few chapters of Geneses actually say? If we look closely we will see that God only cursed Adam and Eve, not mankind.\n \n Secondly God did not require, nor is there any record of Adam ever offering any sacrifices. There is the teaching that God first sacrificed an animal to provide clothing for Adam and Eve. But Geneses does not say that. It says \"The Lord God made garments from skin\". The footnote from my reference says, \"The text gives no indication of how this was done, or how they came by the skins.\" In previous verses, the word 'made' is used several times as God had just completed making the universe. There is no reason to think God would have killed an animal he had just created in order to redeem Adam. In fact the opposite would be assumed which is that he would have just made them from scratch. God seemed to be satisfied with simply cursing the original couple.\n \n Thirdly the concept that a blood sacrifice was required for sins was a later development, which had no relation to Adam since it started long after the death of Adam. The first offerings by Cain and Abel were simply offerings for favor with God and not for any sins. In fact there is no record that Abel even killed his offerings. Cain and Abel just had a meeting with God where they offered him these gifts.\n \n Although blood sacrifices had become a standard part of the Jewish religion, by the time of Jesus, even the false idea that a blood sacrifices were required for remission of sins had been negated from Jewish scripture itself. From the Jewish scriptures in Micah 6\n \n [6] Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?\n [7] Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?\n [8] He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?\n \n So a few hundred years before Jesus we have the Bible stating that a blood sacrifice to appease God is not what he requires. From Micah, the requirement for sacrifices was negated according to Jewish scripture. And the verses are not vague as they clearly state that God is not in any way interested in either animal or human blood sacrifices, but in a mind-set of justice and mercy towards your fellow man and a love of God. And this was confirmed by Jesus in Mark 12:\n \n [28] And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?\n [29] And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:\n [30] And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.\n [31] And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.\n [32] And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:\n [33] And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.\n \n Running out of time, money, and my wife's patience, I will conclude by addressing the fourth point Richard made and how it is at odds with the virgin birth. As Richard pointed out, an eye for an eye is an example of justice for the Jewish God. In other words whatever is wronged must be righted, but by exactly the same replacement or at least equal value. Jewish custom was to sacrifice an animal for their sins against God. This would arguably be the same since the original sin by Adam did not result in the death of a man, and animals are not considered as important as man. Therefore the requirement for a human sacrifice would not be required. But even assuming the necessary sacrifice was a human, the sacrifice should be a perfect man to replace the fall from a perfect state by Adam. The theology of the virgin birth is not for the sacrifice of a perfect man, but for God himself, or a son of God. And to sacrifice God, or his son, for a man is a gross inequity. \n \n In summary, the Christian theology requiring the virgin birth is invalid based on:\n \n 1. Mankind was not cursed because of Adam.\n 2. There is no record of Adam sacrificing for his disobedience. \n 3. The practice of blood sacrifices was not the result of the Adam's sin.\n 4. Micah states that blood sacrifices are not required.\n 5. Jesus confirms that blood sacrifices are not required.\n 6. Assuming a sacrifice was necessary, the sacrifice of God, or his son, would be a gross inequity.\n \n Therefore the theology requiring the virgin birth is a misinterpretation of Jewish scripture.",

   "I would like to start this post by thanking my opponent Hank and dreamweaver as judge (I forgot in my last post). I have made a complete rebuttal of hank's first post and also provided a few counter arguments on the Jewish religion points, so you may find this post rather long, I couldn't decide whether to leave some points until later on or answer the whole of Hank's post right away, but I decided as Hank is the one who will in a sense lead where this debate goes I should do my best to answer all the points he makes. If I were to present a full case for the defence of the virgin birth than it would be very very long, something like Genesis through Revelation would suffice.\n I have rearranged Hank's theological arguments under his summary headings for easier reference and I will start with a defence of my original post. Again I would like to say that this is a rather long post so if any more time is required by hank for any reason then it's ok with me. I appreciate we all have jobs to do so I don't expect exclusive devotion, also Hank's wife might have something to say on that one, and I don't want to be responsible for the wrath of two women, one is bad enough.\n \nI do not see where you have presented an argument for the virgin birth in the science portion of your post. In fact you admit that science does not support the miracle of a virgin birth. Your hope is that science will someday prove the possibility of a virgin birth. Of course should science in the future show that a virgin birth is possible, that in no way gives credence to the belief that Jesus was born of a virgin birth, only that it would be scientifically possible. But as stated above, I will return to the subject of scientific evidence at a later time.\n\n You seem to have misunderstood my original statement regarding science, when I said:\nbut it is not logically valid to use science as an argument against miracles. To believe that miracles cannot happen is as much an act of faith as to believe that they can happen,\n it was not a presentation of a scientific argument, rather a foundation stating that if such an argument were to be introduced to the debate than it would turn into a very illogical and pointless discussion as you quite correctly point out. However, I do like to discuss real science so I look forward to your illogical argument.\n \n \nYour second point basically argues from the perspective that it must be true because if not, your belief and the belief of many others would be wrong. Although I can sympathize with your dilemma, this is hardly a convincing argument. \n \n The truth of the virgin birth will, and should, stand on the facts, regardless of how many people would be disappointed if the truth goes against their beliefs.\n\n Incorrect! My argument was not an appeal to the masses for sympathy, there are many people that believe the virgin birth but it can arguably be said they are not true Christians. The Christian faith I am defending is the same faith that Jesus and his apostles instigated in the first century c.e. because if we read; \n Acts 11:26\n  \"!and, after he found him, he brought him to Antioch. It thus came about that for a whole year they gathered together with them in the congregation and taught quite a crowd, and it was first in Antioch that the disciples were by divine providence called Christians.\"\n So this is the Christian faith I am defending not differing views of 'fundamentals, realists, liberals, ETC. or what ever they prefer to call themselves these days. I am defending the Christian faith of the first century c.e. Nothing added and nothing taken away. It is my position that the virgin birth cannot be removed from Christian Bible teaching otherwise the whole message will be null and void. \n \nThe value of Jesus' existence is his life, death and resurrection, not whether he was born of a virgin or not. Although it is probably true that fundamentalist Christians would be devastated, there are millions of Christians today that are inspired and uplifted by the life and teachings of Jesus that do not believe in the virgin birth.\n\n I agree, there are many people on earth that are inspired by such a man as Jesus, who wouldn't be? But for his life and death to be of any lasting benefit to these people after they have passed away in death, it is essential that he be born of a virgin. Infact if he wasn't born of a virgin then he himself would have had no chance of a resurrection in any capacity. I will expand on this at the end of my rebuttal of Hank's post.\n \n I would compare this to the 17th century Christian theology that the earth was the center of the universe. Because there were verses from the Bible used to support the earth-centered universe, there were calamitous predictions of the fall of Christianity because the Bible would not be true if it turned out that the earth was not the center of the universe. Somehow the church has survived and prospered just fine even though there is overwhelming evidence that the earth is no longer the center of the universe.\n\n Again, a distinction must be drawn between false Christian assumptions and the true Christian teachings of the first century, which I am defending.\n \nTherefore I submit that neither of your points are valid in supporting the virgin birth.\n\n Firstly it must be said that you didn't properly address my points, you seem to have over simplified them to make your submission look sound. Second, you are assuming that you are arguing against a flexible religious doctrine when you are really arguing against God himself, the author of the scriptures. It is my aim to show the consequences on the scriptures if the virgin birth is removed.\n In conclusion my original post is sound because;\n 1) It is illogical to enter science into this virgin birth debate. \n 2) I am not defending every wayward Christian teaching on earth, only the true Christian teaching of the first century.\n 3) The fact of the virgin birth is a pillar in the first century Christian teachings; if it is removed then the whole Bible will experience a supernova type event.\n Therefore my original post on the virgin birth is sound. \n \n \nFor purposes of this debate, I will define 'virgin birth' as the birth of a child that was not conceived with human male sperm. I am open to another definition if my opponent prefers but this definition should suffice for starters.\n\n Yes, but let me define it further;\n Virgin Birth = this debate over whether Mary was and needed to be a Virgin when God fathered his own son within her womb. (Without sperm obviously) \n \n Another\n Also I would like to define what is meant when I say 'perfect' in reference to Adam and Jesus; Adam and Jesus were faultless human beings physically, they used all their brain power, had perfect common sense, perfect logic, perfect immune systems, perfect genes, absolutely no fault was found with them whatsoever (just for the record).\n \n \n Christianity uses ideas from the ancient Hebrew text as their justification for the necessity of the virgin birth. These ideas are woven into the general theology as follows:\n\n Again I must say I'm not defending every dodgy 'Christian' teaching, only the teachings set out in the Bible, so I will go through your list of assumed Bible teachings and correct where necessary. \n \n \n1. Adam, the first man sinned by eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\n\n Agreed! But there is a lot more to this simplified account than meets the eye, which I will go into later on in the debate.\n \n2. That act caused sin to enter the world for all mankind.\n\n Agreed.\n \n3. God required a blood sacrifice to appease his displeasure with this act.\n\n Agreed! Only not from Adam or Eve, there would have been no point. (See my rebuttal of Hank's summary) \n \n4. The sacrifice must be from the best animals.\n\n Absolutely. The best thing available to offer as atonement for sin was an animal. Although this could never equal the sin of the person presenting the sacrifice it was the best thing available. It was not only the animal as such that was the sacrifice for sin it was also the fact that it had to be the best of the flock which in itself was a sacrifice because if you look at the farming industry, the prize animals are more than just valuable they are the entire next generation of the farm, which is a momentous sacrifice to give to your God especially with so many other competing farmers living all around.\n \n5. By default, every man was guilty of sin so the sacrifice was required for every person (meaning males at the time).\n\n All are inherent of sin men, women and children.\n \n6. Sin is passed from generation to generation via the male.\n\n Incorrect! Sin is passed from both parents, and in the case of the virgin birth protection was needed from Mary's imperfection so that the ovum that became the genetically perfect human being of Jesus Christ was not undermined.\n Luke 1:35;\n 35 In answer the angel said to her: \"Holy spirit will come upon you, and power of the Most High will overshadow you. For that reason also what is born will be called holy, God's Son. (NWT)\n \n \n7. The virgin birth was required so that sin would not be transmitted into the body that the person of Jesus would reside in.\n\n Not true! The virgin birth was required so that Almighty God could have a hand in modifying and perfecting the genes of the ovum that would become the Christ. If God didn't intervene than Mary first child would have been just as imperfect as any other child born during the rebellion. The child would legally be called his God's son, anything Jehovah creates or fathers is always perfect!\n \n Now follows the rearranged arguments by hank, which all follow the summery headings he has assumed. \n \n1. Mankind was not cursed because of Adam.\n\n \nBut what does the first few chapters of Geneses actually say? If we look closely we will see that God only cursed Adam and Eve, not mankind.\n\n Incorrect! He did curse mankind, although not directly. Our genetic ancestors Adam and Eve were mankind. By rejecting the perfect rule and order of God they also rejected their right to a perfect genetically pure body. Their punishment for sin would be death;\n Genesis 2:16-17 \n \"From every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction. 17 But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will positively die.\"\n But this could not have been a literal on the spot execution because God had already willed for this previous thing to happen;\n Genesis 1:28\n 28 \"Further, God blessed them and God said to them: \"Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it,\"\"\n So in keeping with his law and justice God did not destroy Adam and Eve on the spot, which he could have done quite legally, instead it seems that somehow the genes of Adam and Eve were affected so they could bring forth children but not die immediately. We being their offspring have also inherited these affected genes, hence imperfection.\n This may seem more understandable when you consider the scientific fact that children inherit diseases or defects from their parents. This can be so with hemophilia, thalassemia (Mediterranean anemia), coronary artery disease, one type of diabetes, and even breast cancer. The children are not personally at fault, yet they may suffer as a result of what they have inherited.\n Romans 5:12\n 12 That is why, just as through one man sin (imperfection) entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned\n It may be a good idea to point out exactly what sin is; \n Following Quoted from 'Reasoning on the scriptures' (WBTS)\n Sin\n Definition: Literally, a missing of the mark, according to the Hebrew and Greek Bible texts. God himself sets the \"mark\" that his intelligent creatures are to reach. Missing that mark is sin, which is also unrighteousness, or lawlessness. (Rom. 3:23; 1 John 5:17; 3:4) Sin is anything not in harmony with God's personality, standards, ways, and will, all of which are holy. It may involve wrong conduct, failure to do what should be done, ungodly speech, unclean thoughts, or desires or motives that are selfish. The Bible differentiates between inherited sin and willful sin, between an act of sin over which a person is repentant and the practice of sin.\n So having imperfect genes from Adam is 'sin' in God's eyes.\n \n \n2. There is no record of Adam sacrificing for his disobedience. \n\n \nSecondly God did not require, nor is there any record of Adam ever offering any sacrifices. \n\n I should hope not too, that would make him a very unjust God. Adam sinned while in complete perfection, while in full control of his body, no weakness existed with Adam he was a genetically pure Human Being, he knew exactly what he was doing and the results of it, he thought he would get something that God was holding back from him, something that he needed or should have had, but he was wrong. Adam will receive no forgiveness for his sin as laid out in;\n Matthew 12:31\n 31 On this account I say to you, Every sort of sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven. \n \n \nThere is the teaching that God first sacrificed an animal to provide clothing for Adam and Eve. But Geneses does not say that. It says \"The Lord God made garments from skin\". The footnote from my reference says, \"The text gives no indication of how this was done, or how they came by the skins.\" In previous verses, the word 'made' is used several times as God had just completed making the universe. \n\n I agree, Genesis only says that he \"made garments of skin\". \n \nThere is no reason to think God would have killed an animal he had just created in order to redeem Adam.\n\n Well no, God couldn't offer something to himself.\n \nGod seemed to be satisfied with simply cursing the original couple.\n\n Indeed he did, but we also suffer as a result. We are their genetic offspring.\n \n3. The practice of blood sacrifices was not the result of the Adam's sin.\n\n \nThirdly the concept that a blood sacrifice was required for sins was a later development,\n\n Correct in a sense! Sacrifices that were presented to God had to be from the heart and with all the soul. The law did later state that animals were required to teach the people that blood would have to be spilled eventually to release mankind from its sinful condition. See end.\n \nwhich had no relation to Adam since it started long after the death of Adam.\n\n Not true! Abel offered a sacrifice, which incidentally must have been dead; otherwise it wouldn't have been much of a sacrifice.\n \nThe first offerings by Cain and Abel were simply offerings for favor with God and not for any sins.\n\n These are the first recorded sacrifices presented to God, they denote that the two men realized their condition in relation to how God had created their parents, obviously Adam and Eve would have told their sons the situation that they had caused. Also as I have said before 'sin' is literally missing the mark of perfection set by God, so they may well not have been presented for any badness or wrongdoing, simply for their imperfect state.\n \n In fact there is no record that Abel even killed his offerings. Cain and Abel just had a meeting with God where they offered him these gifts.\n\n It wouldn't be much of an offering if it could run off at any point. \n \n4. Micah states that blood sacrifices are not required.\n\n \nAlthough blood sacrifices had become a standard part of the Jewish religion, by the time of Jesus, even the false idea that a blood sacrifices were required for remission of sins had been negated from Jewish scripture itself. From the Jewish scriptures in Micah 6\n\n \n \n[6] Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?\n [7] Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?\n\n So the LORD, or Jehovah as I prefer to call him is not pleased with the arrangement of animal sacrifices.\n \n[8] He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?\n\n So as well as the sacrifices, God requires Justness, mercy and humility.\n \nSo a few hundred years before Jesus we have the Bible stating that a blood sacrifice to appease God is not what he requires. From Micah, the requirement for sacrifices was negated according to Jewish scripture. And the verses are not vague as they clearly state that God is not in any way interested in either animal or human blood sacrifices, but in a mind-set of justice and mercy towards your fellow man and a love of God.\n\n No Hank! A misunderstanding of scripture is not an end of the law requirement regarding sacrifices. Nowhere in theses verses dose it say that the law is no longer required, it simply says he's not pleased with it. Take a closer look at the context and we will see that there is to be a legal case against Israel:\n Micah 6:1-2\n 6 Hear, please, YOU people, what Jehovah is saying. Get up, conduct a legal case with the mountains, and may the hills hear your voice. 2 Hear, O YOU mountains, the legal case of Jehovah, also YOU durable objects, YOU foundations of [the] earth; for Jehovah has a legal case with his people, and it is with Israel that he will argue:\n Jehovah is expressing his need for justice to be met. Who is to carry out that that justice? If we look back a bit;\n Micah 5:2\n 2 \"And you, O Beth'le\u00b7hem Eph'ra\u00b7thah, the one too little to get to be among the thousands of Judah, from you there will come out to me the one who is to become ruler in Israel, whose origin is from early times, from the days of time indefinite.\n The Christ is to satisfy justice.\n \n5. Jesus confirms that blood sacrifices are not required.\n\n \nAnd this was confirmed by Jesus in Mark 12:\n \n [28] And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all? \n [29] And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord: \n\n So he's a singular God. Perhaps this is said to rebuff the triune god notions of the surrounding nations at that time.\n \n[30] And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.\n [31] And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.\n\n So we have the two most important laws spelled out.\n \n[32] And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:\n\n He couldn't argue with that could he?\n \n[33] And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.\n\n Yes! More than \"whole burnt offerings\" but it never says they are no longer required.\n p.s. take a look at Psalm 83:18 in your KJ version, just for fun!\n \n6. Assuming a sacrifice was necessary, the sacrifice of God, or his son, would be a gross inequity.\n\n \nI will conclude by addressing the fourth point Richard made and how it is at odds with the virgin birth. As Richard pointed out, an eye for an eye is an example of justice for the Jewish God. In other words whatever is wronged must be righted, but by exactly the same replacement or at least equal value. Jewish custom was to sacrifice an animal for their sins against God.\n\n This was the temporary law that was set up. See end;\n \nThis would arguably be the same since the original sin by Adam did not result in the death of a man,\n\n Incorrect! Adam died for his foolish sin and all of his children thereafter. \n \nand animals are not considered as important as man.\n\n Correct, see end.\n \nTherefore the requirement for a human sacrifice would not be required.\n\n Oh yes it would! See end.\n \nBut even assuming the necessary sacrifice was a human, the sacrifice should be a perfect man to replace the fall from a perfect state by Adam.\n\n Let me explain what justice requires;\n Adam sinned in complete perfection, affecting all the people that were yet to be born from him, so for these people that were born from him to have a chance of life it had to be proven that a man the same as their father Adam could lead a life of complete obedience right up to death, otherwise they would have no legal right to reach genetic perfection.\n \nThe theology of the virgin birth is not for the sacrifice of a perfect man, but for God himself, or a son of God. And to sacrifice God, or his son, for a man is a gross inequity.\n\n Jesus was formed into a perfect man, giving him all the limitations of a man, no extra or no less. He wasn't an angel or anything more powerful than a human, just a man. True, he was more powerful than Adam before he was formed into a man but when he took on the form of a man he became Adam's equal.\n Hebrews 2:9\n 9 but we behold Jesus, who has been made a little lower than angels, crowned with glory and honor for having suffered death, that he by God's undeserved kindness might taste death for every [man].\n \nTherefore the theology requiring the virgin birth is a misinterpretation of Jewish scripture.\n\n Not true for an infinite number of reasons and I will now provide two counter arguments to show how the Virgin Birth is the foundation of the fulfilment of the Jewish law and religion.\n What do the sacrifices foreshadow?\n Following quoted from 'Insight on the Scriptures' (WBTS) \n Atonement Sacrifices. As God directed, the Israelites were to offer sacrifices as sin offerings in order to make atonement. (Ex 29:36; Le 4:20) Of particular significance was the annual Atonement Day, when Israel's high priest offered animal sacrifices and made atonement for himself, for the other Levites, and for the nonpriestly tribes of Israel. (Le 16) Sacrificial animals were to be unblemished, indicating the necessity of perfection on the part of their antitype (Jesus). Also, that atonement is a costly matter is shown in that the victim's life was given, its blood being shed to make atonement. (Le 17:11) Sin offerings made by the Israelites and the various features of the yearly Day of Atonement undoubtedly impressed upon their minds the seriousness of their sinful state and their great need of complete atonement. However, animal sacrifices could not completely atone for human sin because beasts are inferior to man, who was given dominion over them.-Ge 1:28; Ps 8:4-8; Heb 10:1-4;\n Fulfillment in Christ Jesus. The Christian Greek Scriptures plainly link complete atonement for human sins with Jesus Christ. In him the types and shadows of the Mosaic Law find fulfillment, since he is the very One to whom the various animal sacrifices thereof pointed forward. As a perfect, sinless human, Jesus was the sin offering for all of Adam's descendants who eventually are delivered from inherited sin and death. (2Co 5:21) Christ \"offered one sacrifice for sins perpetually\" (Heb 10:12), and he is unquestionably \"the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world.\" (Joh 1:29, 36; 1Co 5:7; Re 5:12; 13:8; compare Isa 53:7.) Forgiveness is dependent on the pouring out of blood (Heb 9:22), and Christians who are walking in the light are assured that \"the blood of Jesus [God's] Son cleanses us from all sin.\"-1Jo 1:7; Heb 9:13, 14; Re 1:5.\n Jesus' perfect human life offered in sacrifice is the antitypical sin offering. It is the valuable thing that accomplishes the purchase of mankind, redeeming them from inherited sin and death. (Tit 2:13, 14; Heb 2:9) Christ himself declared: \"The Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul a ransom [Gr., ly'tron] in exchange for many.\" (Mr 10:45.) His sacrifice atoned exactly for what was forfeited by the sinner Adam, since Jesus was perfect and hence Adam's equal prior to the first man's sin.-1Ti 2:5, 6; Eph 1:7.\n \n Hebrews 10:1-10\n 10 For since the Law has a shadow of the good things to come, but not the very substance of the things, [men] can never with the same sacrifices from year to year which they offer continually make those who approach perfect. \n So these sacrifices must have pointed to a further fulfillment.\n 2 Otherwise, would the [sacrifices] not have stopped being offered, because those rendering sacred service who had been cleansed once for all time would have no consciousness of sins anymore? \n Exactly!\n 3 To the contrary, by these sacrifices there is a reminding of sins from year to year,\n It was in a sense a teaching program.\n 4 for it is not possible for the blood of bulls and of goats to take sins away. \n So Hank's right!\n 5 Hence when he comes into the world he says: \"'Sacrifice and offering you did not want, but you prepared a body for me. 6 You did not approve of whole burnt offerings and sin [offering].' 7 Then I said, 'Look! I am come (in the roll of the book it is written about me) to do your will, O God.'\" 8 After first saying: \"You did not want nor did you approve of sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin [offering]\"-[sacrifices] that are offered according to the Law- 9 then he actually says: \"Look! I am come to do your will.\"\n So this is the one that has come to finish the law.\n He does away with what is first that he may establish what is second. \n So you see there is a finishing off of the Jewish law so that the next phase in human salvation can begin. Matthew 24:14.\n 10 By the said \"will\" we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time.\n Jehovah's justice regarding human sin is now balanced for all time. You now ask for forgiveness for sin in prayer through the name of Christ Jesus and you will be forgiven if you are truly repentant. No sacrifices needed.\n \n What do the Tabernacles and Temples foreshadow?\n Paul said that the Tabernacles and Temples were pictorial or representative of something important at;\n Hebrews 8:5\n 5 \"but which [men] are rendering sacred service in a typical representation and a shadow of the heavenly things; just as Moses, when about to make the tent in completion, was given the divine command: For says he: \"See that you make all things after [their] pattern that was shown to you in the mountain.\"\"\n \n The Tabernacles and Temples were the arrangement for approaching God to receive atonement for sins, this is where the animals would be killed and blood spilled upon the alter to show your recognition of your sinful state. As Hank has already and quite correctly said that animal sacrifices can't remove sin they can only atone or cover them temporarily, so this entire arrangement could only be temporary or symbolic, Which would seem to indicate that God knew that this was not the ideal situation as Hank again clearly showed from the verses of Micah. God knew something more permanent was needed and was about to provide it!\n I will now attempt to show briefly what the temple arrangement foreshadowed starting with an eerily brief description of the typical design of the tabernacles that later became the Temples and of the people that serve there.\n \n High Priest\n The Chief Priest. \n Most Holy\n This was the innermost room of the Tabernacle or Temple, and the only person allowed through the large curtain that separated it from the Holy was the High priest to present the annual sacrifices on the Day of Atonement.\n Holy\n This was the first more larger compartment where the High Priest and the underpriests would serve. \n curtain\n This was the large screen separating the Most Holy and the Holy.\n \n Paul enlightens us to something truly outstanding regarding this design at;\n Hebrews 8:1-2\n 8 Now as to the things being discussed this is the main point: We have such a high priest as this (Jesus), and he has sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens (Most Holy), 2 a public servant of the holy place and of the true tent, which Jehovah put up, and not man.\n A tent (tabernacle), which Jehovah put up? So it can't be physical.\n Hebrews 8:3\n 3 For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; wherefore it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer.\n What did Jesus have to offer to Jehovah?\n Hebrews 10:20\n 20 \"which he inaugurated for us as a new and living way through the curtain, that is, his flesh,\"\n So the curtain pictures Jesus' flesh. \n Hebrews 8:5\n 5 but which [men] are rendering sacred service in a typical representation and a shadow of the heavenly things;\n So the entire design given by Jehovah to Moses for the construction of the tabernacle was to represent or foreshadow something very important. This is further evidenced by the way that God speaks to Moses regarding the layout.\n Exodus 25:9\n 9 According to all that I am showing you as the pattern of the tabernacle and pattern of all its furnishings, that is the way YOU are to make it.\n \n If we recall what happened when Jesus expired on the torture stake at\n Matthew 27:51\n 51 \"And, look! the curtain of the sanctuary was rent in two, from top to bottom,\" \n We will see that Jesus body was the pure perfect Human sacrifice that was required to gain access to the antitypical most holy, Heaven. I may like to point out that no other faithful person who died truly loving and serving Jehovah had ever accomplished such a mean feat, which must mean that this was a genetically perfect man equal to Adam. He was the corresponding ransom foreshadowed in the law by the animal sacrifices, the Christ. \n When Jesus became the high priest of the spiritual temple he was anointed with Holy Spirit at his baptism, which would mean that he was the only one, like the typical High Priests, that was allowed to enter the antitypical Most Holy, his entire commission was the fulfillment of this very important tabernacle design. Which evidently means he was born of a virgin and God, so that God was the father, producing a genetically perfect son, the corresponding genetic equal of Adam.\n \n Here is a synopsis of the subject;\n Typical______Antitypical\n \n High Priest = Jesus Christ. (Hebrews 6:20)\n Most Holy = Heaven. (Hebrews 9:24)\n Holy = Jesus and his clean life and service on earth. (Hebrews 3:1)\n Curtain = Jesus flesh (Sacrifice) (Hebrews 10:20)\n Annual Day of Atonement = Jesus presenting his sacrifice in heaven.\n The antitypical is the fulfillment of the law, it is the spiritual temple of God not a physical one. When Jesus lay down his life in complete and perfect obedience it meant that the curtain (his flesh) was no longer a barrier for him to get into heaven (1Corintians 15:50), he could now enter into the Most Holy (Heaven) and present his sacrifice directly to God himself, as foreshadowed by the typical High Priests. This was the ultimate sacrifice that could be offered by the high priest in the spiritual temple, this sacrifice truly would remove the sin and imperfection brought about by Adam\n Hebrews 8:6\n 6 But now [Jesus] has obtained a more excellent public service, so that he is also the mediator of a correspondingly better covenant, which has been legally established upon better promises.\n \n Jesus' death makes the old law obsolete (not Micah) and absolutely unnecessary. Now we have a law that is truly legal and can erase the effects of Adams sin from all mankind available to anyone that wants it. - Matthew 24:14.\n \n In summary;\n 1. Mankind was affected because of Adam's deliberate sin.\n 2. Justice had to be met before mankind could be restored to genetic perfection.\n 3. The temporary use of blood sacrifices was needed to atone for the imperfection and to teach the people.\n 4. This meant that God would have to intervene in the production of a perfect Human child using an ovum of Mary.\n 5. Jesus meets the requirements and presents himself a sacrifice of complete and perfect obedience. Equal to Adam's perfect disobedience.\n 6. This makes the old Jewish law obsolete and is replaced by Christian law.\n 7. Christian law is the fulfillment of Jewish law and is clearly not a misrepresentation.\n \n Therefore the virgin birth is the foundation of the entire salvation for mankind. \n \n Again, sorry this is such a long post but the space is needed to address all your point appropriately, and provide counter arguments.\n All the best,\n Richard.",

   "In the nick of time. :)\n \n I will respond to some of the comments Richard made on my first post then proceed to my next point.\n \n \nit was not a presentation of a scientific argument,\n\n \n We are in agreement. You did not present a scientific argument.\n \n \nIt is my aim to show the consequences on the scriptures if the virgin birth is removed.\n\n \n Okay but that will not be evidence of the virgin birth. \n \n \nIn conclusion my original post is sound because;\n 1) It is illogical to enter science into this virgin birth debate.\n\n \n I agree there is no scientific evidence for the virgin birth. I would not agree that it is illogical to use science as part of the debate.\n \n \n2) I am not defending every wayward Christian teaching on earth, only the true Christian teaching of the first century.\n\n \n I don&#8217;t see how this is evidence of the virgin birth of Jesus.\n \n \n3) The fact of the virgin birth is a pillar in the first century Christian teachings; if it is removed then the whole Bible will experience a supernova type event.\n\n \n I don&#8217;t agree with that statement but I will concede that result for the sake argument. As I said before, that in no way is evidence for the virgin birth. Proving that X must be true for Y to be true does not prove X. If you make a convincing argument that your car will not start without gas, that does not prove your car has gas. And your argument that if the virgin birth is removed then the Bible will experience a supernova type event, does not prove, or even supply evidence that the virgin birth happened. It just is an argument that the Bible will experience a supernova type event.\n \n \nTherefore my original post on the virgin birth is sound.\n\n \n It may be sound for what you are arguing, but you have not presented any evidence of a virgin birth of Jesus.\n \n \nYes, but let me define it further;\n Virgin Birth = this debate over whether Mary was and needed to be a Virgin when God fathered his own son within her womb. (Without sperm obviously) \n\n \n Whether Mary needed to be a virgin is a separate issue than if she was a virgin. \n \n \nNot true! The virgin birth was required so that Almighty God could have a hand in modifying and perfecting the genes of the ovum that would become the Christ. If God didn&#8217;t intervene than Mary first child would have been just as imperfect as any other child born during the rebellion. The child would legally be called his God&#8217;s son, anything Jehovah creates or fathers is always perfect!\n\n \n Okay I&#8217;m in somewhat of a dilemma here. I just talked to the pastor of the First Baptist Church in the large neighboring town. He informed me that Baptist theology was that sin was passed through the male as I was taught. He has a PhD in theology so I assume he knows what he is talking about. I would also assume that is in general, a protestant belief. I am a lot less familiar with either Catholic or JW beliefs I assumed JW&#8217;s believed like Protestants on this issue which was obviously a bad assumption.\n \n Now that being said, I&#8217;m not clear on what &#8220;so that Almighty God could have a hand in modifying and perfecting the genes of the ovum&#8221; means. You seem to be saying that you don&#8217;t believe God could have modified the genes of Mary&#8217;s ovum if there had been male sperm there. Could you clarify what you mean by that statement and why if God modified the genes of Mary&#8217;s ovum he couldn&#8217;t have modified those same genes after fertilization?\n \n \n So having imperfect genes from Adam is &#8216;sin&#8217; in God&#8217;s eyes.\n\n \n If you are saying that imperfect genes from Adam are &#8216;sin&#8217; in God&#8217;s eyes and God created those imperfect genes by cursing Adam, then God created sin. Also it&#8217;s not just from Adam but from both Adam and Eve.\n \n Even so your theology is that children are condemned when they are born by something that is totally out of their control. No rational person considers punishing children for the sins of their parents as justice.\n \n \n Not true! Abel offered a sacrifice, which incidentally must have been dead; otherwise it wouldn&#8217;t have been much of a sacrifice.\n\n \n Nothing is stated about a sacrifice. Cain&#8217;s offering was not acceptable because it was not the best of his crops, not because it was not a blood offering. Grain offerings and sacrifices were perfectly acceptable as outlined in Leviticus 2. \n \n \nIt wouldn&#8217;t be much of an offering if it could run off at any point.\n\n \n I had to chuckle at the image of Almighty God and Able running around chasing a lamb that had gotten away. Somehow I think a God that had just created the universe could have controlled a domesticated animal.\n \n \nNowhere in theses verses dose it say that the law is no longer required, it simply says he&#8217;s not pleased with it.\n\n \n Micah makes a list of what God requires. Blood sacrifices are not included on that list. Therefore they are not required according to Micah.\n \n \nJesus was formed into a perfect man, giving him all the limitations of a man, no extra or no less. He wasn&#8217;t an angel or anything more powerful than a human, just a man. True, he was more powerful than Adam before he was formed into a man but when he took on the form of a man he became Adam&#8217;s equal.\n\n \n If all that was needed was a perfect man, and Jesus was just a perfect man while here on earth, then there is no need for a virgin birth.\n \n If Jesus was born of a virgin as the Son of God, then the sacrifice is all out of proportion to the deed.\n \n \nNot true for an infinite number of reasons and I will now provide two counter arguments to show how the Virgin Birth is the foundation of the fulfilment of the Jewish law and religion.\n\n \n That&#8217;s a lot of reasons. :)\n \n \nWhat do the sacrifices foreshadow?\n \n What do the Tabernacles and Temples foreshadow?\n\n \n That was a pretty good argument for the theology of Jesus being the requirement for the salvation of mankind but not much about the virgin birth.\n \n \nTherefore the virgin birth is the foundation of the entire salvation for mankind.\n\n \n As stated before, the argument that the virgin birth is the foundation of the entire salvation for mankind is not an argument for the virgin birth. Your car may well not run without gas, but that doesn&#8217;t show you have gas.\n \n Second post \n \n For my second post I am going to discuss two pieces of evidence that are major stumbling blocks to the story of the virgin birth. Both are evidence that the virgin birth story was an &#8216;after the fact&#8217; addition to the life of Jesus and developed after the Christian religion broke away from all Jewish influence.\n \n The pregnancy of Mary before marriage\n \n The first piece of evidence is Luke 2:5 which states that the couple was not married when Jesus was born. Mary lived in a society that considered women property. Their primary function was to carry the seed of their husband. Paternity was extremely important to the Jews as is indicated by the oft-recorded genealogies in the Bible. Men required certainty that a woman was carrying their children. I once read that the parents owned the first-night bed material so they could prove their daughter was a virgin with the bloodstained sheets. The penalty for women having sex outside marriage was stoning. The simple fact is that if the story happened as the Luke says, the birth of Jesus would have been a scandal and Mary would have been lucky to escape with her life. \n \n This is compelling evidence that the story was started at a later time after Mary was dead and all links with the Jewish religion were broken. \n \n The evidence of when the virgin birth story was introduced.\n \n Miraculous births are a common theme in the Bible. However the Jews were careful to note that their God was a special God in that although he might help the elderly or barren become pregnant, he did not commingle with the common folks. He may have walked with Adam and Eve in the garden and had meetings with Cain and Able but sex was out of the question. And by the time Moses came along, it was not even possible to look at him without dying. By the time of Jesus, God was the spiritual Father of the Jews and the physical element of the concept of God was pretty much discarded.\n \n However the belief that God or the gods had affairs with humans was common with the gentiles during the time of Jesus. The Roman and Greek religions had multiple myths concerning this type of encounter between the gods and humans. In this sense the Jewish religion was a step ahead in the development of the relationship between God and man. Some of these myths and probably most of them began based on a real character, or composite of a group of characters in history. But the myth of a heavenly father of a man would develop long after that man had become famous. So before I start with the evidence, I want to touch on the logistics of the story.\n \n Now as for the evidence, scholars for the most part agree on the relative dates of the first New Testament books as being in the following order:\n \n Paul&#8217;s letters\n Mark\n Matthew\n Luke\n \n Since the letters of Paul were the first writings we have about Jesus, it is important to know what those writings say about the birth of Jesus. The first mention of Jesus&#8217; birth occurs in Galatians 4:4\n \n &#8220;But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,&#8221;\n \n Paul states that Jesus was made of a woman and under the law. This statement was made between 49 and 55 C.E. Paul makes no mention of a virgin birth. If it had been raised, Paul would have certainly commented on the validity of the theology. Yet as a Jew he would certainly not consider Jesus as any part of the Pagan belief regarding God mingling with humans. That was a battle the Jews had been fighting for hundreds of years.\n \n Around 56 to 58 C.E. Paul writes in Romans 1:3,4\n \n &#8220;Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:&#8221;\n \n And again in Acts 13:33\n \n &#8220;God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.&#8221;\n \n So according to Paul, Jesus had a perfectly normal birth and was declared the Son of God when God raised him from the dead.\n \n It is obvious that Paul never considered Jesus to be born of a virgin or he would have unequivocally incorporated it into his theology. Unfortunately Paul died (around 64 C.E.) either before this became an issue or anything written by him about the virgin birth has been lost.\n \n What does the book of Mark (written about 65 to 70 C.E.) say about the virgin birth. Actually of course the book of Mark does not mention the virgin birth as anyone familiar with the Gospels knows. At the first of the book, Mark has Jesus being called the Son of God at his Baptism. Therefore the stories of the virgin birth had not yet begun to be circulated or Mark would have surely commented on them.\n \n The first of only two mentions in the Bible of the virgin birth comes from Matthew around 80-90 C.E. after giving the genealogy of Joseph from Abraham. Matthew obviously had the writings of Mark as much material is quoted almost word for word. This writing was after the death of Paul.\n \n The second mention is from Luke which also had the writings of Mark and probably Matthew and was also after the death of Paul. In Luke the story is expanded to show that John the Baptist is subservient to Jesus. That would indicate that there was some competition between the followers of John and the followers of Jesus.\n \n The main point of this evidence is the timing of the virgin birth story. After the rebellion of the Jews and the destruction of the temple in 70 C.E., Christianity developed in the Gentile community. Before that time, much of Christianity was developing in the Jewish community. Christianity was considered a sect of the Jewish religion and was practiced by Jews who sometimes delivered their message in the synagogues. However no Jewish synagogue would have consented to any teachings that affirmed any kind of physical relationship between Jehovah and a woman. The very fact that Christians continued to preach in the synagogues is the strongest evidence possible that the virgin birth story was not taught at the time.\n \n But once the cult broke away from Judaism, which was after the Jewish rebellion when they were being persecuted by the Roman government, Christianity was free to delve into pagan beliefs. This ran counter to any Jewish beliefs but was very instrumental in converting Gentiles to Christianity as they had long held these kinds of beliefs and were very familiar and comfortable with them.\n \n I will add this one thing. James and Jude, who were brothers of Jesus, never said a word about it in the writings attributed to them and Jesus never said a word about it. Common sense would dictate that Jesus&#8217; family would have known about it if anyone did and would have said something about it.\n \n Therefore it is obvious to any critical reading of the Bible that the virgin birth story was an &#8216;after the fact&#8217; addition to the life of Jesus that developed after the Christian religion broke away from all Jewish influence.",

   "Hank, I would again like to thank you for this debate, it is a good way to explore personal belief and to find reasons why others don't believe the same things you do. I will start by answering your points made then again provide more arguments at the end.\n \nOkay but that will not be evidence of the virgin birth. \n\n I disagree, If we have don't have Mary's exhumed body to examine for evidence of a virgin birth and we also don't have any video surveillance of the conception of Jesus, all that leaves is witness statements and reports and we have an abundance of those. The Bible is the witness statement made by various different people over a long period of time all pointing to or mentioning directly the account of the virgin birth. \n For example when the Police arrive at the scene of a crime, first they may try to ascertain the circumstances that they are dealing with, i,e a domestic argument, a street brawl, a gangland battle, a drive by shooting, etc. they take a look around to try to find any evidence they can, on finding some evidence they inform the other officers and the evidence is examined and catalogued, the whole thing is now recorded at the station in report books. On finding some more evidence the police now return to the scene to examine and catalogue, when this is done they return to the police station to add this to their reports. Next a possible suspect becomes apparent, and after further investigation they decide to visit this suspect, they carry out some informal questioning on the suspect and return to add this to their report. It's now decided that this is the guy their looking for so they return to the suspects' home to make an arrest and are successful. With the suspect in the police cells they now add this to their report. On questioning the suspect on-tape they realise that this was the guy who had the main role in the crime, so once again they add this to their reports of the investigation so far. Further more intense questioning brings the suspect to confess his crimes which was all on tape, so they now add this to their reports and the case goes to court and the officers are called upon to present their reports of the investigation to the judge which are overwhelming and he's busted! (Sorry no punch line) \n The Bible is just like the reports made by the police, it is a fundamental piece of evidence in ascertaining exactly what happened and where, so all parts need to be tested and examined to see if they hold any kind of persuasive argument of the event in question. As Jesus was the only one to fulfil the law this surly would lead us to the conclusion that God, according to the Bible, perfected a human ovum in the womb of Mary without the need of male sperm. I will expand on this at the end.\n \n I would not agree that it is illogical to use science as part of the debate.\n\n My point is if human beings can force mutations in a lab this in no way proves that we evolved by a mutation process. Whereas if humans can't produce mutations then this in no way proves that we didn't evolve by a mutation process. If you provide unequivocal evidence that pathogenesis is not possible in humans then that doesn't prove that it didn't happen in the case of Jesus.\n \nI don't see how this is evidence of the virgin birth of Jesus.\n \n Because most other Christian teachings cause chaos in the scriptures, whereas if you leave the Bible alone it will tell you an interesting and logical story about the relationship between God and mankind. It will also show how removing parts of that story cause irregularities and illogic. The way in which you read and interpret the report will expose if the account in question is a logical part of that report, if you have only a few direct witness statements concerning an event but the rest of the situation disagrees with what they say, then you could safely discard their statements as rubbish. However, if the reverse is the case and every part of that situation is in agreement then it would be foolish to discard them.\n \nI don't agree with that statement but I will concede that result for the sake argument. As I said before, that in no way is evidence for the virgin birth. Proving that X must be true for Y to be true does not prove X. If you make a convincing argument that your car will not start without gas, that does not prove your car has gas. And your argument that if the virgin birth is removed then the Bible will experience a supernova type event, does not prove, or even supply evidence that the virgin birth happened. It just is an argument that the Bible will experience a supernova type event.\n\n Wouldn't the existence of a car logically prove that someone had already discovered gasoline?\n \nWhether Mary needed to be a virgin is a separate issue than if she was a virgin. \n\n That's illogical! If a man is shot in the chest at point blank range but suffers only severe bruising and then claims it was because he was wearing a bullet-proof vest, how odd it would be if someone then claims he wasn't wearing a bullet-proof vest. The evidence would lead everyone to conclude he was telling the truth and was wearing a vest otherwise he would have a rather large hole straight through his chest.\n \nOkay I'm in somewhat of a dilemma here. I just talked to the pastor of the First Baptist Church in the large neighboring town. He informed me that Baptist theology was that sin was passed through the male as I was taught. He has a PhD in theology so I assume he knows what he is talking about.\n\n Well Hank, if I had a PhD in Humour would that mean that I was always funny? emoticon_xgood I would like to know what leads the pastor to this conclusion. \n \nNow that being said, I'm not clear on what \"so that Almighty God could have a hand in modifying and perfecting the genes of the ovum\" means. You seem to be saying that you don't believe God could have modified the genes of Mary's ovum if there had been male sperm there. Could you clarify what you mean by that statement and why if God modified the genes of Mary's ovum he couldn't have modified those same genes after fertilization?\n\n Almighty God needed someone that knew the situation well and who better than the very person that was used to create humans, Jesus knew exactly what Adam had done, he knew exactly how humans were made and how they would react to certain situations. He was the ideal candidate to be placed on an even par with Adam to present himself as a perfect human sacrifice. See end.\n \nIf you are saying that imperfect genes from Adam are 'sin' in God's eyes and God created those imperfect genes by cursing Adam, then God created sin. Also it's not just from Adam but from both Adam and Eve.\n\n No! God can't create sin, Adam (and Eve) knew exactly what Jehovah had said to him regarding any potential disobedience, so because God carries out his justice it doesn't make him responsible for the dire consequences that followed. Adam had free will.\n \nEven so your theology is that children are condemned when they are born by something that is totally out of their control. No rational person considers punishing children for the sins of their parents as justice.\n\n In the case of Adam and Eve, perfect humans who had willfully rebelled, they deserved no mercy. Hence, Jehovah sentenced them to death. But his mercy came into play toward their offspring. Jehovah deferred the execution of the death sentence, thus allowing Adam and Eve to have children. He lovingly provided their descendants with hope of deliverance from sin and death.-Genesis 3:15; Romans 8:20, 21.\n Think about it Hank if God had of justly destroyed Adam and Eve in the beginning then he wouldn't have just genetically affected their children, we wouldn't have existed!!! He knew about you and I and decided that things outside of our control could not be a reason for us to have no chance of life, so even though we are born in a defected state we still get a good chance of life. Not only that Hank most the issues of justice were settled before you and I were even born isn't that loving to the highest order.\n \nI had to chuckle at the image of Almighty God and Able running around chasing a lamb that had gotten away. Somehow I think a God that had just created the universe could have controlled a domesticated animal.\n\n Absolutely, God could have made it do a moonwalk to an ancient rendition of \"Billie Jean\" if he wanted, although I don't think Cain and Abel would have appreciated the seriousness of the situation they were in :). It wouldn't have been God's responsibility to keep control of the offering, it was the person presenting it that had to make sure it was sound or presentable. \n \nMicah makes a list of what God requires. Blood sacrifices are not included on that list. Therefore they are not required according to Micah.\n\n Not true, there are many things that Micah doesn't mention but it doesn't mean they're no longer required. I don't tell my wife I love her everyday but it doesn't mean that I don't (but try telling her that emoticon_mad ).\n \nIf all that was needed was a perfect man, and Jesus was just a perfect man while here on earth, then there is no need for a virgin birth.\n\n \n The virgin birth was needed so that God could implant the life patterns of his first-born son into the unfertilised ovum of Mary. See end. \n \nIf Jesus was born of a virgin as the Son of God, then the sacrifice is all out of proportion to the deed.\n\n Adam was in a direct relationship with Jehovah before he sinned, exactly the same as Jesus was in his pre-human existence. It wasn't lack of knowledge that cause Adam to sin, it was selfish use of his own freewill.\n \nThat was a pretty good argument for the theology of Jesus being the requirement for the salvation of mankind but not much about the virgin birth.\n\n Ah well, if we look back through the history of faithful Biblical characters we will see that no one had the potential to fulfil the law, why? Because they weren't genetically perfected at conception by God. Which is extremely strong evidence that there was something special about Jesus, it all points to the fact that Jesus had a very important conception, according to the Bible.\n \n The pregnancy of Mary before marriage\n \n \nThe first piece of evidence is Luke 2:5 which states that the couple was not married when Jesus was born.\n\n This verse talks of the registration requirements of Augustus over all the people, which had to be carried out in their towns or places of birth. It doesn't say that they weren't married only that they had to register themselves individually in their hometowns. It was a census of the people not a full-scale marriage.\n They were married before this registration because they had carried out the customary wedding ceremony;\n Following from 'insight on the Scriptures' vol. 2, pg. 341.\n Ceremony. As to the wedding itself, the central and characteristic feature was the solemn bringing of the bride from her father's home to her husband's home on the date agreed upon, in which act the significance of marriage as representing admission of the bride into the family of her husband found expression. (Mt 1:24) This constituted the wedding in patriarchal days before the Law. It was altogether a civil affair. There was no religious ceremony or form, and no priest or clergyman officiated or validated the marriage. The bridegroom took the bride to his house or to the tent or house of his parents. The matter was publicly made known, acknowledged, and recorded, and the marriage was binding.-Ge 24:67.\n \nMary lived in a society that considered women property. Their primary function was to carry the seed of their husband. Paternity was extremely important to the Jews as is indicated by the oft-recorded genealogies in the Bible. Men required certainty that a woman was carrying their children.... The simple fact is that if the story happened as the Luke says, the birth of Jesus would have been a scandal and Mary would have been lucky to escape with her life. \n\n Exactly! Wouldn't this fact then prove that Joseph would have taken his beloved fianc\u00e9e as wife so she would not be ashamed among the people? They couldn't have stoned Mary without the consent of Joseph, he owned her as you say.\n \nI once read that the parents owned the first-night bed material so they could prove their daughter was a virgin with the bloodstained sheets. The penalty for women having sex outside marriage was stoning.\n\n Mary didn't have sex outside of marriage, God implanted life inside her womb, and with the backing of Joseph over this account people would have more than likely just laughed and concluded that her and Joseph became impatient during their engagement, because Joseph made no charge against his wife and they proceeded to be married. \n Deut. 22:13-21-This practice of keeping the cloth has continued among some peoples in the Middle East until recent times. \n \nThis is compelling evidence that the story was started at a later time after Mary was dead and all links with the Jewish religion were broken. \n\n How? The only one who could bring a charge against Mary for not being pure was Joseph, and he knew the score. \n \n The evidence of when the virgin birth story was introduced.\n \n \nMiraculous births are a common theme in the Bible. However the Jews were careful to note that their God was a special God in that although he might help the elderly or barren become pregnant, he did not commingle with the common folks.\n\n \nHe may have walked with Adam and Eve in the garden and had meetings with Cain and Abel but sex was out of the question.\n\n Walk/Walking is used in the Bible very figuratively, God was never literally present in the Garden of Eden. Notice also it says that it was his voice that was walking in the garden.\n \nAnd by the time Moses came along, it was not even possible to look at him without dying. By the time of Jesus, God was the spiritual Father of the Jews and the physical element of the concept of God was pretty much discarded.\n\n There never was a physical concept, the Bible is written to a physical creation so it's often very symbolic of God. Especially at the start when directed to nomadic tribesmen. \n \n \nNow as for the evidence, scholars for the most part agree on the relative dates of the first New Testament books as being in the following order:\n \n Paul's letters\n Mark\n Matthew\n Luke\n\n This is where the reasoning on your evidence is seriously flawed; you have stated that these books of the Bible were written in that order, yet you have not shown any evidence to back that statement up. I will now provide some evidence of why I believe Matthew was the earliest book written concerning the conception, birth and life of Jesus and also give my thoughts on Paul's earliest writings and the other Gospels.\n Matthew c.41 c,e,\n 1Thessalonians c.50\n 2Thessalonians c. 51\n Galatians c. 50-52 (more likely summer of 52)\n 1Corinthians c. 55\n 2Corinthians c. 55\n Romans c. 56\n Luke c. 56-58\n Ephesians c. 60-61\n Philippians c. 60-61\n Colossians c. 60-61\n Philemon c. 60-61 \n Mark c. 60-65\n \n Matthew predates the other gospels and Paul's writings; \n Following from 'All scripture is inspired of God\" pg. 176-77. \n The exact year is not known, but subscriptions at the end of some manuscripts (all later than the tenth century C.E.) say that it was 41 C.E. and there is nothing in the Gospel to contradict this date. Matthew's Gospel is by no means a mere enlargement of Mark's, the similarity between the two could well be accounted for in that Peter had a copy of Matthew's Gospel and used it in his preaching. Mark, in incorporating parts of what Peter said, would thus be writing down much that Matthew wrote.\n How much of Matthew's Gospel is unique? About 42 percent of its contents. Matthew mentions the Kingdom far more often than do the others, 50 times. The expression \"the kingdom of the heavens,\" used often instead of \"the kingdom of God,\" is unique with him. Further, he gives us ten parables that the others do not and he is more explicit as to figures. It is typical that he alone tells us that it was for thirty pieces of silver that Jesus was betrayed. \n \n There is evidence to indicate that Matthew originally wrote his Gospel in the popular Hebrew of the time and later translated it into Greek. In his work De viris inlustribus (Concerning Illustrious Men), chapter III, Jerome says: \"Matthew, who is also Levi, and who from a publican came to be an apostle, first of all composed a Gospel of Christ in Judaea in the Hebrew language and characters for the benefit of those of the circumcision who had believed.\" Jerome adds that the Hebrew text of this Gospel was preserved in his day (fourth and fifth centuries C.E.) in the library that Pamphilus had collected in Caesarea.\n Early in the third century, Origen, in discussing the Gospels, is quoted by Eusebius as saying that the \"first was written . . . according to Matthew, . . . who published it for those who from Judaism came to believe, composed as it was in the Hebrew language.\" That it was written primarily with the Jews in mind is indicated by its genealogy, which shows Jesus' legal descent starting from Abraham, and by its many references to the Hebrew Scriptures, showing that they pointed forward to the coming Messiah. This evidence would undoubtedly point to an early writing because it deals extensively with the Jews, showing that the Christian organization was still very much in its infancy before it's mass exodus into the gentile nations.\n \n Luke's Gospel precedes Mark's. \n 'All scripture is inspired of God' pg 187.\n Acts 1:1 indicates that the writer of Acts (who was also Luke) had earlier composed \"the first account,\" the Gospel. Acts was most probably completed about 61 C.E. while Luke was in Rome with Paul, who was awaiting his appeal to Caesar. So the Gospel account was probably written by Luke in Caesarea about 56-58 C.E., after he returned with Paul from Philippi at the end of Paul's third missionary journey and while Paul was waiting two years in prison at Caesarea before being taken to Rome for his appeal. Since Luke was there in Palestine, during this time he was well situated to 'trace all things from the start with accuracy' concerning the life and ministry of Jesus. Thus, Luke's account appears to have preceded Mark's Gospel.\n  Marks account is recorded between 60-65c.e.\n \n Since Mark evidently wrote primarily for the Romans, he most likely did his writing in Rome. Both earliest tradition and the contents of the book allow for the conclusion that it was composed in Rome during either the first or the second imprisonment of the apostle Paul, and hence during the years 60-65 C.E. In those years Mark was in Rome at least once, and likely twice. \n \n So the evidence seems to suggest that the only two gospels that directly talk of the virgin birth are the ones that were written first, with the book of Matthew predating all other Christian writings. This overwhelming evidence shows that all other Christian writers were in full knowledge of the fact of the virgin birth so if it was false we should look to them for some kind of rebuttal of this teaching, so moving on to what you've assumed Paul meant in his writings.\n \nSince the letters of Paul were the first writings we have about Jesus, it is important to know what those writings say about the birth of Jesus. The first mention of Jesus' birth occurs in Galatians 4:4\n \n But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,\"\n \n Paul states that Jesus was made of a woman and under the law. This statement was made between 49 and 55 C.E.\n\n So Jesus was God and Mary's son, and as God is a spirit this would mean that it was a sperm free conception.\n \nPaul makes no mention of a virgin birth. If it had been raised, Paul would have certainly commented on the validity of the theology.\n \n Would the driver of a car constantly remind the passengers that he has a steering wheel? They would have all been in full knowledge of the how and why Jesus was conceived.\n \nAround 56 to 58 C.E. Paul writes in Romans 1:3,4\n \n \"Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:\"\n\n Yes Jesus was made \"according to the flesh\" and no doubt he resembled his mother, but this does not show that he had a human father. Mary was of the tribe of Judah and a descendant of David. Hence it could be said of her son Jesus that he \"sprang from the seed of David according to the flesh.\"\n \nAnd again in Acts 13:33\n \n \"God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.\"\n\n I've read this millions of times but I don't see your point.\n \nSo according to Paul, Jesus had a perfectly normal birth and was declared the Son of God when God raised him from the dead.\n\n I'm not sure of the point you are trying to make, how does this affect his conception?\n \nIt is obvious that Paul never considered Jesus to be born of a virgin or he would have unequivocally incorporated it into his theology. Unfortunately Paul died (around 64 C.E.) either before this became an issue or anything written by him about the virgin birth has been lost.\n \n What does the book of Mark (written about 65 to 70 C.E.) say about the virgin birth. Actually of course the book of Mark does not mention the virgin birth as anyone familiar with the Gospels knows. At the first of the book, Mark has Jesus being called the Son of God at his Baptism. Therefore the stories of the virgin birth had not yet begun to be circulated or Mark would have surely commented on them.\n\n Why? Silence on the subject is a very weak argument, if you buy a car from a salesperson you will notice that after he/she runs through the extremely long list of goodies that the car has he will rarely feel the need to point out that it also comes with an adequate steering wheel, fitted as standard. Why does he fail to mention it? Because he knows that you know that the car is unusable without one. \n Wouldn't the phrase \"Son of God\" mean that he was God's son not Josephs?\n \n \nThe first of only two mentions in the Bible of the virgin birth comes from Matthew around 80-90 C.E. after giving the genealogy of Joseph from Abraham. Matthew obviously had the writings of Mark as much material is quoted almost word for word. This writing was after the death of Paul.\n\n \n \nThe second mention is from Luke which also had the writings of Mark and probably Matthew and was also after the death of Paul. In Luke the story is expanded to show that John the Baptist is subservient to Jesus. That would indicate that there was some competition between the followers of John and the followers of Jesus.\n\n \n \nThe main point of this evidence is the timing of the virgin birth story. After the rebellion of the Jews and the destruction of the temple in 70 C.E., Christianity developed in the Gentile community. Before that time, much of Christianity was developing in the Jewish community. Christianity was considered a sect of the Jewish religion and was practiced by Jews who sometimes delivered their message in the synagogues. However no Jewish synagogue would have consented to any teachings that affirmed any kind of physical relationship between Jehovah and a woman. The very fact that Christians continued to preach in the synagogues is the strongest evidence possible that the virgin birth story was not taught at the time.\n\n \n Chief priest Annas questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. However, Jesus says in reply: \"I have spoken to the world publicly. I always taught in a synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and I spoke nothing in secret. Why do you question me? Question those who have heard what I spoke to them. See! These know what I said.\"\n At this, one of the officers standing near Jesus slaps him in the face, saying: \"Is that the way you answer the chief priest?\"(LOL. Jesus was the chief priest)\n \"If I spoke wrongly,\" Jesus replies, \"bear witness concerning the wrong; but if rightly, why do you hit me?\" After this exchange, Annas sends Jesus away bound to Caiaphas. The point is Hank if Jesus was hit and arrested for his teaching then your whole argument holds no water because even after these extreme circumstances the Christian disciples were still allowed to teach and preach in the synagogues.\n \nBut once the cult broke away from Judaism, which was after the Jewish rebellion when they were being persecuted by the Roman government, Christianity was free to delve into pagan beliefs. This ran counter to any Jewish beliefs but was very instrumental in converting Gentiles to Christianity as they had long held these kinds of beliefs and were very familiar and comfortable with them.\n\n I agree with you 100% that the Christian organization became filled with pagan teachings after moving into gentile nations, but this is not so with the Virgin Birth account, it fits to well with the rest of the scriptures, unlike others that I need not mention. \n \nI will add this one thing. James and Jude, who were brothers of Jesus, never said a word about it in the writings attributed to them and Jesus never said a word about it. Common sense would dictate that Jesus' family would have known about it if anyone did and would have said something about it.\n\n Not directly no but again like the rest of the scriptures their writings fit like a glove with the account of the Virgin Birth, which is further evidence that it is a well know and factual account. At James 1:1 and Jude 1 both brothers humbly avoided identifying themselves as full fleshly brothers of the Lord Jesus Christ.\n \n Jesus' Pre-human existence requires the Virgin Birth.\n \n John 8:23\n 23 So he went on to say to them: \"YOU are from the realms below; I am from the realms above. YOU are from this world; I am not from this world.\n \n John 6:62\n 62 What, therefore, if YOU should behold the Son of man ascending to where he was before?\n I don't think their would be many arguments from people concerning the pre-human existence of Jesus (Although it wouldn't surprise me) which also has a bearing on the need for a sperm-less conception.\n John 3:13\n 13 Moreover, no man has ascended into heaven but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man.\n This is the point; Jesus existed before his life on earth and was then transferred into the womb of Mary, there is no room in this equation for a human father, all that would produce is a child of that father but as we know Jesus is very often referred to as the Son of God. So again we have further evidence that the Virgin Birth is a valued and most essential part of God's word.\n \n The use of Jesus for paying the ransom is evidence for the Virgin Birth \n \n Following on from what I said near the start of this post, God wanted to prove the love he had for all of Adam's offspring because he had, out of necessity, allowed a human family to be born in an imperfect state, and the best way that Jehovah and Jesus could prove this was to form Jesus into a man and to allow him to be killed by unreasonable religious nutcases. By doing this it would prove that Jehovah would go to extreme lengths to bring back mankind from the war-torn and strife filled world that he had permitted in order to prove Satan wrong. Jesus and Jehovah have spent evidently billions of years together and love each other beyond compare, obviously God could not come to earth to prove this himself so he sent the next best thing his firstborn son. For it says \"he is the reflection of [God's] glory and the exact representation of his very being.\" (Hebrews 1:3). First he had to remove Jesus from the spirit realm, which would have been an enormous sacrifice in itself and then transfer his life patterns into the womb of Mary, watch him grow up in a nation that so much profaned God's name, and then watch them kill him, his first born son. If all this is not proof that God will go to the most extreme lengths to prove his love then I don't know what does! Now, add a human father to this equation and the whole thing becomes a lot less personal don't you think? God would in effect be sitting back and saying that we should sort out our own problems, all he would do is produce a perfect human child using two Human parents, which would die a loyal death, and hey-presto justice has been done, NO! God wanted to prove something.\n \n John 3:16\n 16 \"For God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, \n \n 'Seventy week' prophecy in Daniel\n The prophecy that I would like to focus on is the one at chapter 9, verses 22-27. This prophecy is again in keeping with the virgin birth account, infact it requires the event because it say that the messiah will appear and \"terminate transgression, and finish of sin, and to make atonement for error, and to bring in righteousness for times indefinite\" again this must denote that God would intervene in the conception of Jesus to produce a perfect human who would be qualified to pay the ransom required. \n \n Therefore the Virgin birth account is a vital part of the scriptures, although this can never prove that it actually happened, it gives it a lot more credibility if it fits in with the report that has been written over 1500 years with fantastic harmony and purpose. The Virgin Birth account fits in every corner of the Bible there is not a single verse that conflicts with the account, infact the account is echoed or pointed to in all the scriptures, as I've said before it's the foundation of the salvation for mankind making it, in a biblical sense, fact.\n \n Richard,",

   "Hank", 
   "Hank, I would again like to thank you for this debate, it is a good way to explore personal belief and to find reasons why others don&#8217;t believe the same things you do. [/quote]\n \n Well it has been my pleasure Richard. I have enjoyed the challenge.\n \n I had to work this weekend and am not happy with this post. I don&#8217;t feel I put enough time into the research but don&#8217;t want to delay it.\n \n \nI disagree, If we have don&#8217;t have Mary&#8217;s exhumed body to examine for evidence of a virgin birth and we also don&#8217;t have any video surveillance of the conception of Jesus, all that leaves is witness statements and reports and we have an abundance of those. The Bible is the witness statement made by various different people over a long period of time all pointing to or mentioning directly the account of the virgin birth. \n\n \n I agree there is very little that could even be considered evidence of a virgin birth. However I was referring to the fact that proving the consequences on the scripture if the virgin birth is removed, does not prove that it happened.\n \n \nFor example when the Police arrive at the scene of a crime, first they may try to ascertain the circumstances that they are dealing with, i,e a domestic argument, a street brawl, a gangland battle, a drive by shooting, etc. they take a look around to try to find any evidence they can, on finding some evidence they inform the other officers and the evidence is examined and catalogued, the whole thing is now recorded at the station in report books. On finding some more evidence the police now return to the scene to examine and catalogue, when this is done they return to the police station to add this to their reports. Next a possible suspect becomes apparent, and after further investigation they decide to visit this suspect, they carry out some informal questioning on the suspect and return to add this to their report. It&#8217;s now decided that this is the guy their looking for so they return to the suspects&#8217; home to make an arrest and are successful. With the suspect in the police cells they now add this to their report. On questioning the suspect on-tape they realise that this was the guy who had the main role in the crime, so once again they add this to their reports of the investigation so far. Further more intense questioning brings the suspect to confess his crimes which was all on tape, so they now add this to their reports and the case goes to court and the officers are called upon to present their reports of the investigation to the judge which are overwhelming and he&#8217;s busted! (Sorry no punch line) \n \n The Bible is just like the reports made by the police, it is a fundamental piece of evidence in ascertaining exactly what happened and where, so all parts need to be tested and examined to see if they hold any kind of persuasive argument of the event in question. As Jesus was the only one to fulfil the law this surly would lead us to the conclusion that God, according to the Bible, perfected a human ovum in the womb of Mary without the need of male sperm. I will expand on this at the end. \n\n \n The scenario you have provided is not an analogy of the evidence we have for the virgin birth using the Bible. There are two people who say it happened. We don&#8217;t know who those people are. We don&#8217;t know how they learned of this news. They tell their story at least 50 years after the event was supposed to have happened. There is no physical evidence. The only explanation is to say &#8216;god did it&#8217;. And the people that are saying it happened are obviously biased. If you want to compare it to a legal case today, it would never even get to trial.\n \n However you keep making arguments about how it does damage to the Bible if not true. So what if it does. That doesn&#8217;t prove it happened. The two are not linked. If you are trying to say that it must be true if the Bible says it&#8217;s true because the Bible is the word of God, then you haven&#8217;t given proved that the Bible is the word of God which is a whole different debate.\n \n \nBecause most other Christian teachings cause chaos in the scriptures, whereas if you leave the Bible alone it will tell you an interesting and logical story about the relationship between God and mankind.\n\n \n So it tells an interesting story, although I don&#8217;t know how a supernatural birth is logical. But Cinderella and lots of other stories are interesting. And some of them are logical. And again I&#8217;ll say, because you believe that it causes chaos in the scriptures does not prove it happened. It just causes chaos in the scriptures.\n \n \n It will also show how removing parts of that story cause irregularities and illogic.\n\n \n I will agree that the Bible has irregularities and is often illogical without you even making the case.\n \n \n The way in which you read and interpret the report will expose if the account in question is a logical part of that report, if you have only a few direct witness statements concerning an event but the rest of the situation disagrees with what they say, then you could safely discard their statements as rubbish. However, if the reverse is the case and every part of that situation is in agreement then it would be foolish to discard them. \n\n \n No one who was or could have been a direct witness to the event you are claiming happened has said a word about the event happening. What is foolish is to depend on the statements of someone you didn&#8217;t know, someone that was obviously biased, someone that didn&#8217;t say how they found out, and someone that said it 50 years later. In legal terms it&#8217;s called hearsay and is inadmissible in a court. \n \n \nWouldn&#8217;t the existence of a car logically prove that someone had already discovered gasoline? \n\n \n Yes because one of linked to the other. But it wouldn&#8217;t prove or even be evidence that there was gas in the car.\n \n \nThat&#8217;s illogical! If a man is shot in the chest at point blank range but suffers only severe bruising and then claims it was because he was wearing a bullet-proof vest, how odd it would be if someone then claims he wasn&#8217;t wearing a bullet-proof vest. The evidence would lead everyone to conclude he was telling the truth and was wearing a vest otherwise he would have a rather large hole straight through his chest.\n\n \n I had to chuckle again at your choice of analogies. You pick a story that is obviously true and then say in effect &#8216;see my story must be true&#8217;. Problem is the analogy does not apply to the original statement. You have introduced direct evidence in your analogy. There is no severe bruising evidence. If there was, it would be a slam-dunk case and we wouldn&#8217;t be having this debate. You only have a couple of unknowns saying 50 years later that something happened that they didn&#8217;t see.\n \n If you want to make an analogy to the original statement with a man and a bullet-proof vest it would be: I have proved that a man needed to wear a bullet-proof vest. Therefore I have proved he was wearing a bullet-proof vest. Which if of course not proof at all.\n \n \nWell Hank, if I had a PhD in Humour would that mean that I was always funny? I would like to know what leads the pastor to this conclusion. \n\n \n Although I am debating you personally, I am also debating the virgin birth in general. I used the pastor as an example of an expert on protestant religion. I realize the Catholics believe in the Immaculate Conception and now I realize you believe something in between I think. My dilemma was how to address three theologies instead of just two.\n \n \nAlmighty God needed someone that knew the situation well and who better than the very person that was used to create humans, Jesus knew exactly what Adam had done, he knew exactly how humans were made and how they would react to certain situations. He was the ideal candidate to be placed on an even par with Adam to present himself as a perfect human sacrifice. See end. \n\n \n Well that&#8217;s all interesting but I was hoping you would address my question. I wasn&#8217;t asking what Almighty God needed (seems an oxymoron), but why if God was going to modify the genes of Mary&#8217;s ovum he didn&#8217;t just do it after the ovum was fertilized? \n \n \nNo! God can&#8217;t create sin, Adam (and Eve) knew exactly what Jehovah had said to him regarding any potential disobedience, so because God carries out his justice it doesn&#8217;t make him responsible for the dire consequences that followed. Adam had free will.\n\n \n You stated in your previous post:\n \n &#8220;So in keeping with his law and justice God did not destroy Adam and Eve on the spot, which he could have done quite legally, instead it seems that somehow the genes of Adam and Eve were affected so they could bring forth children but not die immediately. We being their offspring have also inherited these affected genes, hence imperfection.&#8221;\n \n Since according to you God &#8220;affected&#8221; the genes of Adam and Eve, then God caused this imperfection which you say is sin. So although God may not have been &#8216;responsible&#8217; for the disobedience, he created the defective genes by &#8220;affecting&#8221; them.\n \n \nIn the case of Adam and Eve, perfect humans who had willfully rebelled, they deserved no mercy. Hence, Jehovah sentenced them to death. But his mercy came into play toward their offspring. Jehovah deferred the execution of the death sentence, thus allowing Adam and Eve to have children. He lovingly provided their descendants with hope of deliverance from sin and death.&#8212;Genesis 3:15; Romans 8:20, 21.\n \n Think about it Hank if God had of justly destroyed Adam and Eve in the beginning then he wouldn&#8217;t have just genetically affected their children, we wouldn&#8217;t have existed!!! He knew about you and I and decided that things outside of our control could not be a reason for us to have no chance of life, so even though we are born in a defected state we still get a good chance of life. \n\n \n I disagree that Adam and Eve deserved no mercy but that&#8217;s a different issue. I also disagree that Almighty God could not have continued life even if Adam and Eve were destroyed. But you have not addressed that fact that according to your theology, God has punished children for something that they did not do and is totally out of their control.\n \n You also did not address the fact that grain sacrifices were perfectly acceptable. In other words a blood sacrifice was not required, just a sacrifice.\n \n \nNot only that Hank most the issues of justice were settled before you and I were even born isn&#8217;t that loving to the highest order. \n\n \n Love of the highest order is my theology that God is made us all to be with him in the future and mankind is perfecting itself because God set it up that way from the beginning. :)\n \n \nNot true, there are many things that Micah doesn&#8217;t mention but it doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re no longer required. I don&#8217;t tell my wife I love her everyday but it doesn&#8217;t mean that I don&#8217;t (but try telling her that ). \n\n \n If you told your future wife you had meet the requirements for yours and her marriage, then at the ceremony you did not have a marriage license, she would not accept that when you said you meet the requirements you weren&#8217;t talking about the marriage license.\n \n When you buy a car and the financial officer gives you a list of requirements for the loan, you don&#8217;t accept it if he comes back later and says &#8216;Oh there&#8217;s other requirements you have to meet. I just didn&#8217;t mention them&#8217;.\n \n When you buy a house and the mortgage company gives you a list of requirements for buying the house, you would not be happy if after you moved in the mortgage company said you owed more money that they just didn&#8217;t mention.\n \n A list of requirements is everything that is required. Hence the name, list of requirements.\n \n \nThe virgin birth was needed so that God could implant the life patterns of his first-born son into the unfertilised ovum of Mary. See end. \n\n \n What are &#8216;life patterns&#8217;?\n \n \nAdam was in a direct relationship with Jehovah before he sinned, exactly the same as Jesus was in his pre-human existence. It wasn&#8217;t lack of knowledge that cause Adam to sin, it was selfish use of his own freewill. \n\n \n You are equating Adam with Jesus. If you are going to say that Jesus is the Son of God, then they are not equal. And it doesn&#8217;t matter why Adam sinned.\n \n \nAh well, if we look back through the history of faithful Biblical characters we will see that no one had the potential to fulfil the law, why? Because they weren&#8217;t genetically perfected at conception by God. Which is extremely strong evidence that there was something special about Jesus, it all points to the fact that Jesus had a very important conception, according to the Bible.\n\n \n Because the Bible says that Jesus was born of a virgin doesn&#8217;t mean Jesus was born of a virgin. You have presented no evidence that the Bible is infallible. And it makes no claim to Jesus being genetically perfect. You have brought that into the debate lately.\n \n \nThis verse talks of the registration requirements of Augustus over all the people, which had to be carried out in their towns or places of birth. It doesn&#8217;t say that they weren&#8217;t married only that they had to register themselves individually in their hometowns. It was a census of the people not a full-scale marriage.\n\n \n [4] And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)\n [5] To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.\n [6] And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.\n \n If that&#8217;s not saying Mary was Joseph&#8217;s espoused wife then I don&#8217;t know how it can be made any clearer.\n \n \nThey were married before this registration because they had carried out the customary wedding ceremony;\n\n \n Yes a contradiction. Something I am addressing in this post. \n \n \nExactly! Wouldn&#8217;t this fact then prove that Joseph would have taken his beloved fianc\u00e9e as wife so she would not be ashamed among the people? They couldn&#8217;t have stoned Mary without the consent of Joseph, he owned her as you say. \n\n \n Mary was found to be pregnant before she was married to Joseph. Therefore she would have been the responsibility of her father who didn&#8217;t know anything about the virgin birth. Besides there&#8217;s the story in the Bible about the woman caught in adultery and brought to Jesus. There is nothing about them consulting with her husband. When someone is accused of stealing, they don&#8217;t check with their husband to see if he want&#8217;s her prosecuted. It&#8217;s a crime against the state.\n \n \nMary didn&#8217;t have sex outside of marriage, God implanted life inside her womb, and with the backing of Joseph over this account people would have more than likely just laughed and concluded that her and Joseph became impatient during their engagement, because Joseph made no charge against his wife and they proceeded to be married. \n\n \n Whether God implanted life inside her womb or not is what we are debating. Making an assertion is not evidence.\n \n Sex before marriage was no laughing matter during the time of Mary. But if that was the case, Jesus would have been considered a bastard. Latter in the gospels Jesus is sometimes referred to as Rabbi. No bastard child could be a Rabbi.\n \n \nHow? The only one who could bring a charge against Mary for not being pure was Joseph, and he knew the score. \n\n \n Because the Jews had fought the battle of God interacting with humans and they would never have accepted a God-human offspring as part of their religion. If the story is like told in the Bible, then it would have been obvious that Mary was pregnant when they were married. Therefore it had to be after the break from the Jewish religion.\n \n \nWalk/Walking is used in the Bible very figuratively, God was never literally present in the Garden of Eden. Notice also it says that it was his voice that was walking in the garden.\n \n There never was a physical concept, the Bible is written to a physical creation so it&#8217;s often very symbolic of God. Especially at the start when directed to nomadic tribesmen. \n\n \n What are you talking about. It tells of God having an everyday conversations with Adam, Eve, the snake, Cain and Able. They talk just like I talk to my wife every day.\n \n \nThis is where the reasoning on your evidence is seriously flawed; you have stated that these books of the Bible were written in that order, yet you have not shown any evidence to back that statement up. I will now provide some evidence of why I believe Matthew was the earliest book written concerning the conception, birth and life of Jesus and also give my thoughts on Paul&#8217;s earliest writings and the other Gospels.\n\n \n I said most New Testament scholars place the books I listed in that order. I can&#8217;t account for every person in the world that has an idea about the dates. I was in the bookstore a few days ago and looked in the rather large bible section to check out your assertion. I picked up all five of the Bible commentaries there were in that book store and every one of them had the books listed in that order. I also checked some online sources and every one I looked at gave the same listing. Your argument about that is with the experts on that issue. I freely admit that I am not an expert in that field and won&#8217;t argue with those that are.\n \n \nMatthew predates the other gospels and Paul&#8217;s writings; \n\n \n I didn&#8217;t re-quote your comments about Matthew and Luke being written before Mark in the interest of space. However it is obvious that the writer of Matthew had Mark available or the writer of Mark had Matthew available or they had some original material that has now been lost available since almost all of Mark is in Matthew.\n \n \n The gospels were placed in the order they were thought to be written in from the very beginning. So the only question that modern scholarship has shown is that Mark was written before Matthew. \n \n \nSo Jesus was God and Mary&#8217;s son, and as God is a spirit this would mean that it was a sperm free conception. \n\n \n This would have been the perfect time for Paul to state that Jesus was born of a virgin. Instead he states that Jesus was born under the law. That doesn&#8217;t indicate a virgin birth which would have been very unusual, not a normal &#8216;under the law&#8217; birth.\n \n \nWould the driver of a car constantly remind the passengers that he has a steering wheel? They would have all been in full knowledge of the how and why Jesus was conceived. \n\n \n *chuckle* Another analogy. Everyone can look and see that a car has a steering wheel. No one can look and see that Jesus was born of a virgin. \n \n \nYes Jesus was made &#8220;according to the flesh&#8221; and no doubt he resembled his mother, but this does not show that he had a human father. Mary was of the tribe of Judah and a descendant of David. Hence it could be said of her son Jesus that he &#8220;sprang from the seed of David according to the flesh.&#8221; \n\n \n Another perfect time for Paul to state that Jesus was born of a virgin. Instead he states that Jesus was born according to the flesh of the seed of David. And we don&#8217;t know whether the genealogy of Mary came through David or not. There is no record of that. Of course it is obvious that Jesus was born of Mary. That can&#8217;t be faked. So Paul had no reason to say that for Mary&#8217;s sake. He could only be stating that Jesus had a normal birth.\n \n But how was Jesus declared the Son of God? According to Paul, by his resurrection from the dead, not by a virgin birth. \n \n \nI&#8217;ve read this millions of times but I don&#8217;t see your point.\n \n I&#8217;m not sure of the point you are trying to make, how does this affect his conception? \n\n \n Paul says Jesus was begotten of God on the day he raised him from the dead. And that theology is stated several times by Paul. If Jesus was begotten by God on the day he raised him from the dead, he was not begotten by God at any earlier time.\n \n \nWhy? Silence on the subject is a very weak argument, if you buy a car from a salesperson you will notice that after he/she runs through the extremely long list of goodies that the car has he will rarely feel the need to point out that it also comes with an adequate steering wheel, fitted as standard. Why does he fail to mention it? Because he knows that you know that the car is unusable without one. \n\n \n Another analogy! And I really like this on because it will make my point. How many times (assume this has happened to you just for grins :) ), do you think you would buy a viper automobile and the salesperson would not mention that it has an engine that makes it the fastest car in the US? All four gospels, Paul, Peter, James and others talk in length about the teachings of Jesus. All four gospels, Paul, Peter, James and others talk in length about the crucifixion of Jesus. All four gospels, Paul, Peter, James and others at least mention the resurrection of Jesus. These are the crux of the theology of Christianity. You say that without the virgin birth, Christianity will have an implosion, and two of the Gospels and the founder of Christianity don&#8217;t even mention the event but they mention all the other parts of the life of Jesus several times.\n \n Not a lot of people question the life or crucifixion of Jesus. And at least there are reported to be several people that witnessed the resurrected Jesus. But the most difficult part of Christianity to believe is the virgin birth. And you want to say that because today we know that two people wrote down that Jesus was born of a virgin, and the wrote it at least 50 years after his birth, that the reason no one else said a word about it was because it was well known? Silence on the subject screams out that it was not even considered at the time of the writings of the New Testament.\n \n \nWouldn&#8217;t the phrase &#8220;Son of God&#8221; mean that he was God&#8217;s son not Josephs?\n\n \n Wouldn&#8217;t the phrase &#8220;son of man&#8221; that Jesus used all the time mean he was the son of a man, not God&#8217;s? It&#8217;s not clear what Paul meant by the term the &#8216;Son of God&#8217;. But it is clear that Paul considered that the was applied because of his resurrection, not because of his birth.\n \n \nChief priest Annas questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. However, Jesus says in reply: &#8220;I have spoken to the world publicly. I always taught in a synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and I spoke nothing in secret. Why do you question me? Question those who have heard what I spoke to them. See! These know what I said.&#8221;\n At this, one of the officers standing near Jesus slaps him in the face, saying: &#8220;Is that the way you answer the chief priest?&#8221;(LOL. Jesus was the chief priest)\n &#8220;If I spoke wrongly,&#8221; Jesus replies, &#8220;bear witness concerning the wrong; but if rightly, why do you hit me?&#8221; After this exchange, Annas sends Jesus away bound to Caiaphas. The point is Hank if Jesus was hit and arrested for his teaching then your whole argument holds no water because even after these extreme circumstances the Christian disciples were still allowed to teach and preach in the synagogues. \n\n \n Any Jew could teach in the synagogue. That wasn&#8217;t unusual. What would not have been permitted was to teach that someone was the physical Son of God. They would have been thrown out.\n \n Both Mark and Luke state that Jesus either said or implied that he was the Son of God to the high priest which is the cause of them wanting him killed. If they had Jesus killed for saying that, there is no way they would have permitted his followers to teach that later. \n \n \nI agree with you 100% that the Christian organization became filled with pagan teachings after moving into gentile nations, but this is not so with the Virgin Birth account, it fits to well with the rest of the scriptures, unlike others that I need not mention. \n\n \n It&#8217;s mentioned in two places in the entire Bible. If it were left out, the theology of Christianity would be exactly the same.\n \n \nNot directly no but again like the rest of the scriptures their writings fit like a glove with the account of the Virgin Birth, which is further evidence that it is a well know and factual account. At James 1:1 and Jude 1 both brothers humbly avoided identifying themselves as full fleshly brothers of the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\n \n They are identified as the brothers of Jesus in other parts of the Bible. What&#8217;s the problem with them being the brother of Jesus? This sounds like it was truly one of those things that was common knowledge and therefore no need in pointing it out. It was not a supernatural event that was part of Christian theology.\n \n \nJesus&#8217; Pre-human existence requires the Virgin Birth.\n\n \n None of the verses you quoted say anything about a virgin birth.\n \n \nThe use of Jesus for paying the ransom is evidence for the Virgin Birth \n\n \n None of the verses you quoted say anything about a virgin birth. \n \n \n&#8217;Seventy week&#8217; prophecy in Daniel\n\n \n None of the verses you quoted say anything about a virgin birth. You just make a statement that the virgin birth is required because Jesus is a perfect human. You have stated that God changed the genetics of Mary&#8217;s ovum to make Jesus perfect genetically which is what you call sin. If that was the case, God could have done the same thing after the ovum was fertilized.\n \n And I have shown verses that show Paul&#8217;s theology was that Jesus became the Son of God at the time and because of his resurrection. Either way it doesn&#8217;t match or require a virgin birth.\n \n \nTherefore the Virgin birth account is a vital part of the scriptures, although this can never prove that it actually happened, it gives it a lot more credibility if it fits in with the report that has been written over 1500 years with fantastic harmony and purpose. The Virgin Birth account fits in every corner of the Bible there is not a single verse that conflicts with the account, infact the account is echoed or pointed to in all the scriptures, as I&#8217;ve said before it&#8217;s the foundation of the salvation for mankind making it, in a biblical sense, fact.\n\n \n You have tried to argue that Jesus being perfect genetically is required for the sacrifice for the sins of Adam. Even if that were true, which I have shown isn&#8217;t required, that doesn&#8217;t mean a virgin birth is necessary as God could have just as easily purified the ovum of Mary after fertilization as before.\n \n Comparison of Matthew and Luke\n \n For my third post I want to discuss the conflicts in the stories of Matthew and Luke.\n \n Matthew starts with the genealogy of Joseph. It is obviously the genealogy of Joseph because it ends with &#8220;and Jacob begat Joseph&#8221;. It traces the line back to Abraham and is concerned with the number fourteen, although it gets the numbers wrong. Luke gives the genealogy of Joseph after the baptism of Jesus. It is obviously the genealogy of Joseph also as it begins with &#8220;Joseph, which was the son of Heli&#8221;. So although the both got the required genealogy going through David, we don&#8217;t even know if the father of Joseph was Jacob or Heli. The names of the ancestors don&#8217;t match, the numbers of generations don&#8217;t match, and the length of each generation is grossly off.\n \n In Matthew Joseph is told that Mary was having a child via the Holy Spirit in a dream. It then states that Joseph brought Mary home to be his wife. It doesn&#8217;t say when that happened but it seems to be before Jesus was born. It also appears that Mary was &#8216;showing&#8217; her pregnant state by which Joseph found out she was pregnant since he was thinking about putting her away before he had his dream. In Luke, the story is much more elaborate and Mary is the focus of the story with Joseph not even mentioned later. Mary apparently doesn&#8217;t tell her espoused husband of this event but heads to her cousin&#8217;s house to tell her. Presumably an unmarried pregnant teenager traveling on a 75 mile trip for a three month stay is acceptable to her parents but it strains the imagination to think so during this time in history. I guess Mary doesn&#8217;t consider a little deception concerning her condition a problem if the Holy Spirit is involved so she doesn&#8217;t tell Joseph since he found out later because he observed it. But she returns after three months which is presumably when Joseph sees her in this condition and has his dream. Since this culture is totally controlled by males and Mary is portrayed as having this wealth of freedom, all of this is obviously an addition by someone in the church to propagate the idea of a Mary that conforms to the church&#8217;s mindset. At least the story from Matthew&#8217;s perspective agrees with the culture of the time. \n \n From the perspective of Matthew, Mary and Joseph live in Bethlehem where Jesus is born. Although Jesus is said to live in Nazareth in all other parts of the Bible and his birth in Bethlehem is not an issue, it was necessary for Jesus to be born in Bethlehem, the City of David, in order to fulfil the messiah prophecy. Matthew accomplishes this by the obvious solution of just living there. To get Jesus to Nazareth, Matthew has a story about King Herod looking for Jesus so they must flee immediately into Egypt. Later when the coast is clear, they are in the process of returning to their home in Judea (presumably Bethlehem where they came from) when another warning that oops, it&#8217;s not safe after all. Therefore they travel to Nazareth where Jesus is raised. However in Luke, the method to get Jesus&#8217; birth in Bethlehem is a census where Joseph must travel to Bethlehem to be taxed. He then makes this 75 mile trip with a pregnant Mary who is now still his fianc\u00e9e, as opposed to Matthew where they got married before. There seems to be no danger as Herod is unaware or unconcerned of the birth so they hang around Bethlehem for a while and visit Jerusalem while they&#8217;re in the area. After the Jerusalem visit the return home to Nazareth without the Egyptian side trip.\n \n In Matthew they are visited by some wise men (astrologers) who are following a star and in Luke the visit is by shepherds who had been told by a group of angels. How they actually found Joseph and Mary in the town is not clear but somehow they found them and knew that was the right couple.\n \n In Matthew the astrologers had told Herod that the star first appeared two years before. It&#8217;s ludicrous to think Joseph and Mary would have been hanging around in Bethlehem for two years if they had just went there to be taxed.\n \n Since Luke and Matthew have many almost identical stories, it is obvious that either Luke had Matthew to copy from or they copied from the same source. That makes it also obvious that the birth narratives were not available to both since there would have been at least an attempt to reconcile these major differences.\n \n These contradictions show that the two stories must have been inserted into the gospels at a latter time and without the knowledge of each other.",
