Its everyone's responsibility to keep themselves and others safe.

   "The police certainly do play an important role in fighting crime, but I don't think a person should rely on them alone.\n\n \n Good, because according to the Supreme Court in the 1855 case of South v. Maryland, the police have no obligation to protect anyone.\n \n \"that while Pottle was engaged about his lawful business, certain evil-disposed persons came about him, hindered and prevented him, threatened his life, with force of arms demanded of him a large sum of money, and imprisoned and detained him for the space of four days, and until he paid them the sum of ,500 for his enlargement.\"\n \n That South, the sheriff, being present, the plaintiff, Pottle, applied to him for protection and requested him to keep the peace of the State of Maryland, he, the said sheriff, having power and authority so to do. That the sheriff neglected and refused to protect and defend the plaintiff and to keep the peace, wherefore, it is charged, \"the sheriff did not well and truly execute and perform the duties required of him by the laws of said state,\" and thereby the said writing obligatory became forfeited and action accrued to the plaintiff.\n \n This declaration does not charge the sheriff with a breach of his duty in the execution of any writ or process in which Pottle, the real plaintiff in this case, was personally interested, but a neglect or refusal to preserve the public peace, in consequence of which the plaintiff suffered great wrong and injury from the unlawful violence of a mob. It assumes as a postulate that every breach or neglect of a public duty subjects the officer to a civil suit by any individual who, in consequence thereof, has suffered loss or injury, and consequently that the sheriff and his sureties are liable to this suit on his bond because he has not \"executed and performed all the duties required of and imposed on him by the laws of the state.\"\n \n That means regular people are on their own.\n \n \nSo you do have to take responsibility for your own safety. That's obvious.\n\n \n Good.\n \n \nBut that doesn't necessarily mean owning a gun is a good way to take responsibility for your own safety.\n\n \n It also doesn't necessarily mean that being unarmed is a good way to protect yourself. Being unarmed by choice is a stupid and foolish and counterproductive. \n \n \nThere are many ways to avoid being a victime of crime such locking your doors, avoiding dangerous places, and not staying out too late at night.\n\n \n That entire sentence of yours falls apart completely when compared to this article:\n \n As customers watched in horror Sunday afternoon, a man stabbed a woman and attempted to set her on fire in the parking lot of a Jackson store, witnesses said. \n \n The attack was stopped by a passer-by, who held the man at gunpoint until police arrived, witnesses said.\n \n The suspect, Henry Watson, 42, was arrested and is expected to face aggravated assault charges, Jackson Police Department Cmdr. Lee Vance said. Watson's wife, Gracie Watson, 42, was transported to the University of Mississippi Medical center, where she was listed in good condition.\n \n \"It wasn't five minutes from when she had left my line when I heard a scream outside,\" said Theresa Stuckey, a cashier at the Family Dollar at 516 Nakoma Drive in Jackson. \"I looked out, and (the attacker) was on top of her stabbing her, and stabbing her and stabbing her.\n \n \"She was screaming, 'Help, he's trying to kill me!' She was rolling on the ground, trying to get out of the way, but he kept stabbing her. He stabbed her about 20 times in the neck, back and arms.\"\n \n As the attack continued, people were yelling at the man to stop and honking their horns, Stuckey said. She said she called 911.\n \n \"He was just standing over her hacking away,\" said Dolly Baker, who had just left the Save-A-Lot store next door when she saw the attack.\n \n Baker said she watched the man pour gasoline on the victim then try to strike a match.\n \n \"He was literally trying to kill that lady in broad daylight,\" she said.\n \n Baker said a passer-by stopped the attack.\n \n \"He told the man, 'Stop, or I'm going to shoot. And if you run, I'm going to kill you,' \"Baker said.\n \n The man held Watson at bay until police arrived at the scene.\n \n \"Right now, all we know is that (Watson) attacked his wife. For what reason, we don't know,\" Jackson Police Department Sgt. Eric Smith said.\n \n Police said they are looking for the passer-by who stopped the attack and would like to talk to him but don't know who he is or where he went.\n \n The incident occurred about 3:50 p.m.\n \n Smith said he did not know exactly how many times Gracie Watson was stabbed but said it was more than 10 times.\n \n Every single day people are assaulted in broad daylight, in public places, even when people are around to watch the act taking place, and nothing is going to change that fact.\n \n Are you still so sure that the right answer is to be unarmed and rely on locked doors for your own protection? What happens when somebody bent on causing harm or murder disregards their surroundings and decides to harm someone?",

If you're aware of the fact that the world is full of danger and that people are being victimized in the area you live in, and you still choose to be unarmed and think that you'll be fine, it's a very stupid decision. It's not just regular stupid, it's \"I don't need to brush my teeth, that's what I've got a dentist for\" stupid, it's \"I don't need a fire extinguisher, that's what the fire department is for\" stupid.\n \n \nYou never explained what you meant by this statement.\n\n \n Really?

I am so used to the sound of gunfire that I can distinguish the diference between it, fire-crackers and a car back-firing.\n \n OK?\n \n http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/police/crime-statistics/codefor/statistics.asp?year=2007\n http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-10-30-city-crime-list_x.htm\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis-St._Paul\n \n \nI don't know whether to take offense to that or not.\n\n \n No need - unless you owe allegience to the Crips, Bloods or Disciples. Thats what I mean by thugs.\n \n \nAlright with this one I DO know to take offense. This insinuates, to me at least, that the only people who have a gun for their own protection are the less than educated individuals who don't know enough to think before firing on someone.\n\n \n Not at all. My brother, my son's dad and my closest cousin all own guns for various reasons. I do believe there are some dumb red-necks who are gung-ho on the gun thing - and they scare me. I don't know where you fit in the picture - but the fact that you think that choosing not to own a gun is stupid speaks volumes.\n \n \nBrains might do good for helping you notice signs that a situation might be about to turn bad, but a gun is significantly better than the sharpest brains when trouble comes looking for you. You can out think a person but you can't out think physical harm.\n\n \n Nor can you always gun your way out of it. A lot of the kids who end up dead where I like were packing heat.\n \n \nI'm not talking mandatory gun ownership, and I don't think anybody else has either, that qualifies as a duty and not a right. The duty aspect comes from the fact that you're responsible for yourself and your family.\n\n \n I know you aren't, but there are people in here who have advocated for it. It was just an easy summary. \n \n \nI was born and raised in New York, then I moved to Kansas. Went from a setting where urban warfare and close quarter combat tactics were likely the tactics to be seen, to a setting where things aren't so likely.\n\n \n Where in Kansas? Kansas City is more dangerous than New York or Minneapolis - but apparently on the Missouri side.\n \n \nWell owning a gun might not prevent you from encountering a robber, but it'll certainly make it a lot harder for a criminal to dominate you because you don't have any options.\n\n \n If I am faced by a robber I am going to give them what they want regardless of whether I am armed. Even if armed I would only use a weapon in a life or death situation, not a dude wants my wallet situation.\n \n \nJitobear, I want to hear (read) you actually say that, if someone kicked down the door to your house (apt.) while you and your family were home, you would actually prefer not to have a gun. Is that true? Would you PREFER to face the 'thugs' without a gun? Even if your wife were about to be raped or shot? Would you really prefer to be unarmed if attacked by a knife or gun weilding psyco? Yes or NO?\n\n \n I am a single woman. And if I were keeping that gun locked up as safety dictates, then its not likely to help me if someone suddenly came barging in. Most rapists are someone you know. Physchos barging in with their only intent being killing or raping you are pretty rare. Most of the crime where I live is gang-related. I am not in a gang, my chubby white old lady XXX is not likely to be mistaken for a GD, so the worst I am likely to deal with are bulgerly (and that tends to happen while folks are not at home) or stray bullets. A gun won't help me in either situation, and would likely just make me a target for theft.",

   "I am a former battered wife, rape victim, mugging victim and I live in a violent neighborhood - and I still made this decision. It is well-reasoned decision. Its not stupid. There are pros and cons to gun ownership and I believe that the cons outweigh the pros.\n\n \n You've been raped, beaten and mugged, and you still say that you don't need a gun? After seeing this I'm not sure I can have an intelligent conversation with you.\n \n \n[*]If you keep your gun stored as safety recommends (unloaded and locked up) its not going to be much help in a rush.\n\n \n Reccomends, not dictates. Reccomendations also fail to take into consideration the need for a firearm immediately. We call \"safe storage\" laws by the more appropriate \"protection of violent home invaders\" law.\n \n \n[*]I am not comfortable with them and would likely end up shooting myself in the foot.\n\n \n This is a myth perpetuated by the anti-gun side to play on the fears of those who don't have any actual experience with firearms. The likliehood of it taking place is extremely low.\n \n \n[*]The gun would just be something the local thugs would want to steal from me. Currently I am under their radar - I don't do business with them and I do not own anything of huge value.\n\n \n So you're actually relying on thugs and criminals and trusting them enough to not victimize you? That's just plain stupid.\n \n \n[*]There is no evidence that owning a gun makes you safer. I tried to find some stats that show that gun ownership makes you safer. I found none. Some opinions - but no stats. I did find stats stating the opposite, though. The ones I found most telling are bolded.\n\n \n I disagree, and I'm sure anyone else who's ever used a gun to defend themselves against imminent and certain death would disagree with you as well.\n \n \nThe risk of suicide or homicide is twice as high for individuals with a family history of registered handgun purchase, than for those without such a history.\n\n \n I call BULL on this! This is nothing more than Kellerman sanctioned #### with no basis of reality.\n \n \nThe presence of a gun in the home triples the risk of homicide in the home.\n \n \n See above.\n \n \nBeen there done that. See above. I am assuming nothing. I think its stupid to assume that a gun will make you safe.\n\n \n Not safe, safer. There's no such thing as true safeness, only safer than you were at a previous point.\n \n \nWhy does everyone think that Minneapolis is a smallish town covered in arctic frost year round? We are the largest city east of the Mississippi until you hit the California coast. Technically we are two cities (Minneapolis and St. Paul). With a population of 3.5 million we are the 16th largest and 13th most populated city in the country. In Minneapolis we had about 45 murders in 2007, I don't know exactly how many there were in St. Paul, but probably around half of that. According to a list of over 300 cities published by USA Today, Mpls ranked as the 27th most dangerous city - more dangerous than New York, Chicago, or LA.\n \n \n I was asking for the crime rates for your city, not a rant about how people think it's some small and remote outpost. Living in the more dangerous areas of a city don't really amount to anything if a city only has five murders a year.\n \n \nTwo boys have been shot in the head on my block. I am so used to the sound of gunfire that I can distinguish the diference between it, fire-crackers and a car back-firing.\n\n \n Sounds just like in Washington D.C. with a near-total ban on guns, but they STILL need gunshot sensors to let the police know exactly where and when the constant gunfire is coming from.\n \n \nNot at all. My brother, my son's dad and my closest cousin all own guns for various reasons. I do believe there are some dumb red-necks who are gung-ho on the gun thing - and they scare me.\n\n \n Only reason for fearing them is because they seem to be our media-selected representative/mascot and hurt our credibility.\n \n \nI don't know where you fit in the picture - but the fact that you think that choosing not to own a gun is stupid speaks volumes.\n\n \n You're the one who chooses to remain unarmed and helpless even though you've been assaulted on so many occasions.\n \n \nNor can you always gun your way out of it. A lot of the kids who end up dead where I like were packing heat.\n\n \n Sounds more like it's young punk thugs being killed because of engaging in illegal activities.\n \n \nWhere in Kansas? Kansas City is more dangerous than New York or Minneapolis - but apparently on the Missouri side.\n\n \n Concordia.\n \n \nIf I am faced by a robber I am going to give them what they want regardless of whether I am armed. Even if armed I would only use a weapon in a life or death situation, not a dude wants my wallet situation.\n\n \n Life and death situations are common enough, in my opinion, to warrant having a gun and knowing how to use it. Never know when a simple hold up might turn sour.\n \n \nI am a single woman. And if I were keeping that gun locked up as safety dictates, then its not likely to help me if someone suddenly came barging in. Most rapists are someone you know.

   "You've been raped, beaten and mugged, and you still say that you don't need a gun? After seeing this I'm not sure I can have an intelligent conversation with you.\n\n \n Likewise - since you are relying on insults and opinion rather actual facts or civil debating techniques.\n \n Killing my husband would have been seriously trumatic, dragged me through a murder trial and potentially have left my son without a mother. It was much easier and more appropriate to simply divorce the bastard.\n \n The guy who mugged me, just wanted my purse. I had my four year old with me. The mugger had no weapon, just his superior physical strength. I am not going to kill a man for $7 and my make-up.\n \n I was 14, it was aquaintance rape - I neither was old enough to own a gun or really comprehend what was going on. I was also dragged down an alley in Spain once - I got out of that situation by watching for an opening and running from the guy's drunk XXX.\n \n \nReccomends, not dictates. Reccomendations also fail to take into consideration the need for a firearm immediately. We call \"safe storage\" laws by the more appropriate \"protection of violent home invaders\" law.\n\n \n Are you freakin nuts? I have a KID! I am not leaving a loaded weapon about the place. Hell - he has even been through gun safety training, knows how to and has handled many weapons and hunts and I still would not leave one laying about loaded. What if one of his nitwhit friends finds it? Do you have any comprehension how stupid kids are? \n \n My mother knew a woman who lost her three year old nephew because he ate the loaded gun his father kept tucked under a pillow for safety.\n \n \nThis is a myth perpetuated by the anti-gun side to play on the fears of those who don't have any actual experience with firearms. The likliehood of it taking place is extremely low.\n\n \n The fact that I am not comfortable handling guns is not a myth, I assure you. The shooting myself in the foot line was simply an attempt at brevity.\n \n \nSo you're actually relying on thugs and criminals and trusting them enough to not victimize you? That's just plain stupid.\n\n \n No. Of course they could. But I am also aware of the type of criminals that operate where I live. They aren't the randomly murdering psychopath types. They are gang members involved in trafficing drugs and theft. I am not going to kill or threaten to kill them for stealing my stuff and I don't do or deal drugs so I won't be doing business with them. The chances of gun being useful to me are pretty slim. There is an off chance that it could be. There is a greater chance that it could stolen or used against me.\n \n \nI disagree, and I'm sure anyone else who's ever used a gun to defend themselves against imminent and certain death would disagree with you as well.\n \n I call BULL on this! This is nothing more than Kellerman sanctioned #### with no basis of reality.\n \n See above.\n\n \n This is swell, but further evidence of what I found online. Opinions and no facts. Provide me with some statiscal information that disproves the statistics, not opinions.\n \n \nNot safe, safer. There's no such thing as true safeness, only safer than you were at a previous point.\n\n \n I agree. What I disagree with is with the idea that a gun makes you safer. In some situations sure, but not many and I find the risks of gun ownership are much greater than the benefits. \n \n \nI was asking for the crime rates for your city, not a rant about how people think it's some small and remote outpost. Living in the more dangerous areas of a city don't really amount to anything if a city only has five murders a year.\n\n \n I provided you a direct link to them along with my description.\n \n \nSounds just like in Washington D.C. with a near-total ban on guns, but they STILL need gunshot sensors to let the police know exactly where and when the constant gunfire is coming from.\n\n \n We have gunshot sensors here, too. They are helping.\n \n \nOnly reason for fearing them is because they seem to be our media-selected representative/mascot and hurt our credibility.\n\n \n No - I fear an idiot with a gun because he is an idiot. However, I do believe that most people who own guns are responsible citizens who I trust to be safe with their weapons. I do not support banning guns. Gun ownership is a constitutional right. My beef with you is that you insult those who choose not to. \n \n \nYou're the one who chooses to remain unarmed and helpless even though you've been assaulted on so many occasions.\n\n \n I am not helpless just because I don't carry a gun. That is a fallacy.\n \n \nSounds more like it's young punk thugs being killed because of engaging in illegal activities.\n\n \n Without question. I am simply pointing out that the fact that they carried a gun did not make them safe.\n \n \nLife and death situations are common enough, in my opinion, to warrant having a gun and knowing how to use it. Never know when a simple hold up might turn sour.\n\n \n I don't. I think accidental deaths due to guns, having your own weapon used against you, etc. are far more common and from what I have found, the stats, counts and numbers bear that out. \n \n \nSucks to be you then.\n\n \n I don't think it does.\n \n \nJitobear is thankful that she has nothing of value to steal and appearently thinks her life isn't important either. That is the skewed logic of Liberalism. Take note...\n\n \n Do not twist my words or add intent. I said I own nothing of great value (as in big ole TVs and naging stereo systems and other such objects). It don't have them because I prefer instead to spend my money on things like travel, concerts, and my son's college fund. I have never been interested in superficial, grandious displays of wealth. There are better uses for my time and money.\n \n And I value my life just fine. That stats say I am safer without a gun.\n \n \nI don't understand the automatic assumption that someone who owns a gun is a 'nut case' in fact, that seems kind of narrow minded. Pleanty of normal people own guns. Most of us aren't hoplophiles. Cops aren't paranoid nutcases but they take their guns home. A gun is a tool, nothing more. The tool can't be evil, only intent. I don't know how you can believe you have the right to tell me how to defend my family.\n\n \n Cry me a river and build me a boat. Nobody in this thread has been more insulted by Ghostrider and you than me. She started this thread with the sole purpose of paying insult to those who choose not to own a gun and you backed her. The assumption that people who choose not to own a gun are stupid, nerds, victims, and don't care about their lives is equally as narrow-minded as claiming gun-owners are nut-cases. Yet, between the two of you I have accused of all these things and I support your right to own a gun.\n \n Frankly, neither of you has any right to claim any moral high ground when it comes to debating techniques or being insulted.",
