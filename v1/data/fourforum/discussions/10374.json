   "Olbermann to Bush: 'Your hypocrisy is so vast' \n A reaction to Thursday's press conference: the president was the one who interjected Gen. Petraeus into the political dialogue in the first place\n SPECIAL COMMENT\n By Keith Olbermann\n Anchor, 'Countdown'\n Updated: 6:59 p.m. PT Sept 20, 2007\n \n So the President, behaving a little bit more than usual, like we would all interrupt him while he was watching his favorite cartoons on the DVR, stepped before the press conference microphone and after side-stepping most of the substantive issues like the Israeli raid on Syria, in condescending and infuriating fashion, produced a big political finish that indicates, certainly, that if it wasn't already - the annual Republican witch-hunting season is underway.\n \n \"I thought the ad was disgusting. I felt like the ad was an attack not only on General Petraeus, but on the U.S. Military.\"\n \"And I was disappointed that not more leaders in the Democrat party spoke out strongly against that kind of ad.\n \"And that leads me to come to this conclusion: that most Democrats are afraid of irritating a left-wing group like Moveon.org or more afraid of irritating them, than they are of irritating the United States military.\"\n \"That was a sorry deal.\"\n \n First off, it's \"Democrat-ic\" party. \n You keep pretending you're not a politician, so stop using words your party made up. Show a little respect.\n Secondly, you could say this seriously after the advertising/mugging of Senator Max Cleland? After the swift-boating of John Kerry? \n But most importantly, making that the last question?\n So that there was no chance at a follow-up?\n \n So nobody could point out, as Chris Matthews so incisively did, a week ago tonight, that you were the one who inappropriately interjected General Petraeus into the political dialogue of this nation in the first place!\n \n Deliberately, premeditatedly, and virtually without precedent, you shanghaied a military man as your personal spokesman and now you're complaining about the outcome, and then running away from the microphone?\n \n Eleven months ago the President's own party, the Republican National Committee, introduced this very different kind of advertisement, just nineteen days before the mid-term elections.\n \n Bin Laden.\n Al-Zawahiri's rumored quote of six years ago about having bought \"suitcase bombs.\"\n All set against a ticking clock, and finally a blinding explosion and the dire announcement:\n \"These are the stakes - vote, November 7th.\"\n \n That one was ok, Mr. Bush?\n Terrorizing your own people in hopes of getting them to vote for your own party has never brought as much as a public comment from you? \n The Republican Hamstringing of Captain Max Cleland and lying about Lieutenant John Kerry met with your approval?\n \n But a shot at General Petraeus, about whom you conveniently ignore it, was you who reduced him from four-star hero to a political hack, merits this pissy juvenile blast at the Democrats on national television?\n \n Your hypocrisy is so vast that if we could somehow use it to fill the ranks in Iraq you could realize your dream and keep us fighting there until the year 3000.\n \n The line between the military and the civilian government is not to be crossed.\n \n When Douglas MacArthur attempted to make policy for the United States in Korea half a century ago, President Truman moved quickly to fire him, even though Truman knew it meant his own political suicide, and the deification of a General who history suggests had begun to lose his mind.\n \n When George McClellan tried to make policy for the Union in the Civil War, President Lincoln finally fired his chief General, even though he knew McClellan could galvanize political opposition which he did when McClellan ran as Lincoln's presidential opponent in 1864, nearly defeating our greatest president.\n \n Even when the conduit flowed the other way and Senator Joseph McCarthy tried to smear the Army because it wouldn't defer the service of one of McCarthy's staff aides, the entire civilian and Defense Department structures, after four years of fearful servitude, rose up against McCarthy and said \"enough\" and buried him.\n \n The list is not endless but it is instructive.\n \n Air Force General LeMay-who broke with Kennedy over the Cuban Missile Crisis and was retired.\n \n Army General Edwin Anderson Walker-who started passing out John Birch Society leaflets to his soldiers.\n \n Marine General Smedley Butler-who revealed to Congress the makings of a plot to remove FDR as President and for merely being approached by the plotters, was phased out of the military hierarchy.\n \n These careers were ended because the line between the military and the civilian is not to be crossed!\n \n Mr. Bush, you had no right to order General Petraeus to become your front man.\n \n And he obviously should have refused that order and resigned rather than ruin his military career.\n \n The upshot is and contrary it is, to the MoveOn advertisement he betrayed himself more than he did us.\n \n But there has been in his actions a sort of reflexive courage, some twisted vision of duty at a time of crisis. That the man doesn't understand that serving officers cannot double as serving political ops, is not so much his fault as it is your good, exploitable, fortune.\n \n But Mr. Bush, you have hidden behind the General's skirts, and today you have hidden behind the skirts of 'the planted last question' at a news conference, to indicate once again that your presidency has been about the tilted playing field, about no rules for your party in terms of character assassination and changing the fabric of our nation, and no right for your opponents or critics to as much as respond.\n \n That is not only un-American but it is dictatorial.\n \n And in pimping General David Petraeus and in the violation of everything this country has been assiduously and vigilantly against for 220 years, you have tried to blur the gleaming radioactive demarcation between the military and the political, and to portray your party as the one associated with the military, and your opponents as the ones somehow antithetical to it.\n \n You did it again today and you need to know how history will judge the line you just crossed. \n \n It is a line thankfully only the first of a series that makes the military political, and the political, military. \n \n It is a line which history shows is always the first one crossed when a democratic government in some other country has started down the long, slippery, suicidal slope towards a Military Junta.\n \n Get back behind that line, Mr. Bush, before some of your supporters mistake your dangerous transgression, for a call to further politicize our military",

   "One Strong Ad\n by John Bruhns (DC) \u00b7 9/24/2007 10:07:00 AM ET\n Discuss this post here: Comments (213) \u00b7 digg it \u00b7 reddit \u00b7 FARK \u00b7 \u00b7 Link\n \n For the past couple weeks MoveOn.org's ad \"General Betray Us\" has dominated the news and even managed to be condemned by the U.S. Senate. It has gone so far as having almost every Presidential candidate put to the \"patriotism test\" by the media with questions related to their feelings toward the ad. It even got the President on record saying \"I think it's disgusting.\" As if it's treason - well America, it's not.\n \n This is a quite common tactic used in modern day politics, and some might argue that it originated with the Bush/Cheney 2000 campaign when they ruthlessly attacked John McCain in the South Carolina primary. They rallied the right wing against McCain with accusations of being the candidate of gay people, having an African-American love child, and that he was not mentally capable of being Commander in Chief because of his time as prisoner of war in Vietnam caused him to be \"the Manchurian Candidate.\" I totally disagree with John McCain and his politics, but to this day, as a veteran, I am still outraged by what Bush did to him in 2000 with his Rovian style, cut-throat, political smear machine. To me that is \"DISGUSTING.\"\n \n Then it went on to Senator Max Cleland who gave up most of his body in service to his country. We all know how they despicably attempted to put a true American patriot like Max Cleland into the same category as Bin Laden in a campaign ad for one of their fellow draft dodgers - Saxby Chambliss. That is just as low as you can go. To me that is \"DISGUSTING.\"\n \n Then came the presidential campaign of 2004 with the notorious \"swift boat veterans for truth.\" They continuously bashed John Kerry's military service in Vietnam on behalf of two cowardly draft dodgers like George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. At the Republican National Convention hundreds displayed purple band aids on their faces mocking John Kerry's multiple purple hearts. To me that is \"DISGUSTING.\"\n \n Bush didn't stop with John Kerry. He decided to attack the entire Democratic Party when they began to initiate legislation that would bring the war in Iraq to an end. Bush said the Democratic Party is \"now the party of cut and run.\" Coming from a man who knows damn well how to \"cut and run\" from a war he supported (Vietnam) - that is \"DISGUSTING.\"\n \n In November of 2005 Congressman John Murtha made himself ripe for the picking by Bush's henchman who will search the entire planet to dig up anyone to counter decorated war heroes who question Bush's and Cheney's war, again - \"DISGUSTING.\" But thanks to Senator James Webb, people saw right through the lies.\n \n It doesn't stop at the top though - it goes down to the lower levels as well. And for the most part you don't hear about these incidents. When I returned home from Iraq I attended a Kerry/Edwards rally in Kansas City where I was greeted by the \"Young Republicans\" carrying signs that read \"Students for Bush.\" Outraged at the sight of it I asked them \"If you support George W. Bush and his war in Iraq - why don't you join the military and go over and fight?\" In response they screamed at me \"traitor,\" \"you support terrorists,\" and \"move to France.\" I will never forget how I was treated by a group of able-bodied males, who fully supported and advocated for a war I fought, but lacked the courage to go anywhere near. To me that is \"DISGUSTING.\"\n \n Up until now the swiftboating of heroic combat veterans was all fair game for Bush, his cronies in Congress, and his minuscule portion of left over supporters (including Fox News). The ad from MoveOn.org against Petraeus finally woke America up to the reality of what George W. Bush has done for the last 7 years of his tragic presidency. It's just sad that no one came out on the national level in a similar manner in which they did to MoveOn.org to condemn Bush for his attacks on Cleland, Kerry, Murtha, The Democratic Party, and other patriots who wore the uniform in service to our great nation.\n \n I am not writing this to attack General Petraeus. But when a General testifies to Congress on the so called success of a failed policy he puts himself out there for those who disagree to practice their first amendment rights. General Petraeus, with all due respect, could not even say that what we are doing in Iraq is making America safer. He even had the audacity to suggest that the surge has been so successful that we can draw down 30,000 troops by July of 2008. The surge was put in place to establish a secure environment for political reconciliation to take place in Iraq among multiple warring factions. Well folks, the Iraqi government practically collapsed during the surge. We had the bloodiest summer to date during the surge. And by next summer General Petraeus is going to draw down the surge? Then what? We will be right back to square one - Donald Rumsfeld's plan of fewer troops in a completely hostile civil war without end. All General Petraeus' testimony accomplished was a smokescreen for George W. Bush to hide behind and deny reality for the rest of his presidency. The reality is that the war in Iraq is Bush's failure, and he will continue to use people like General Petraeus to carry out his needless war in Iraq for the duration of his presidency while our troops die on a daily basis.\n \n I PLACE THE BLAME COMPLETELY ON GEORGE W. BUSH.\n \n I'm glad the ad from MoveOn.org raised awareness among Bush's loyal followers who for so long took pleasure in throwing decorated combat veterans under the bus just because those veterans had the courage and the right to disagree. Right or wrong - my hat is off to MoveOn.Org !\n \n John Bruhns\n Iraq War Veteran\n Legislative Representative\n Americans Against Escalation In Iraq\n www.IraqCampaign.org",
