It's good to know your prayers\n will go unanswered. michael777\n\n \n The only passage needed to disprove your interpretation is Rev 13 itself. And I thought you knew what it said well enough so that I didn't need to post it. But let's go through it together if you like and I'll show you why Mahmoud Abbas is way too minor a political or historical character to the the antichrist, which the beast in Rev. 13 is describing, according to every theologian out there.\n \n Rev 13:1 \n THEN I[fn1] stood on the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns,[fn2] and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads a blasphemous name.\n \n This verse is key to setting up the whole chapter. It gives us an idea where the beast comes from, generally speaking. And of his character. But there is much more than that to be gleaned from this verse. Here's a link that will give you some valid scriptural insight as I could never adequately explain it in one post, as you will see from this link. http://www.bible.org/page.php?page_id=1766 Many believe the ten horns refer to the ten nations that make up the European common market. This is where the AC will come from. Not a middle eastern Country. It is possible the second beast will who brings the false religion to worship the first beast will come from the middle east imo.\n \n Rev 13:2 \n Now the beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.\n Rev 13:3 \n And I saw one of his heads as if it had been mortally wounded, and his deadly wound was healed. And all the world marveled and followed the beast.\n \n Verse 3 is key to us recognizing the ac when he does arrive. How? Because he will receive a mortal, meaning fatal head wound, probably an assassination attempt by someone who recognizes him as the ac. But he will be healed, I believe after 3 days, duplicating the resurrection of Christ and the world will follow him. Obviously this hasn't happened yet so Abbas can't be linked through this verse.\n \n Rev 13:4 \n So they worshiped the dragon who gave authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, \"Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?\"\n Rev 13:5 \n And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue[fn3] for forty-two months.\n \n The Dragon is satan, and the beast is antichrist. verse 4 is saying that the dragon will be worshiped as will the beast. So the beast is leading the unsaved to the dragon as he gains political clout Verse 5 shows that he will be given authority for 42 months, or 3 1/2 years. Half the tribulation period when it is shown that he will draw the world together in a pseudo type of peace.\n \n Rev 13:6 \n Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven.\n Rev 13:7 \n It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe,[fn4] tongue, and nation.\n Rev 13:8 \n All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.\n Rev 13:9 \n If anyone has an ear, let him hear.\n \n At verse 6 is the start of the second half of the 7 year tribulation. He will desecrate the Holy of Holies in the newly rebuilt 3rd Temple of David in Jerusalem. This is called the abomination of desolation and is when the Jew will finally have the spiritual scales removed from his eyes and see not only antichrist for who he is, but will see that Jesus is Messiah. Verses 7,8 and 9 speak to his war to silence all believers at that time and to force the world to worship him. This will be the start of the darkest time in History and the carnage will make the holocaust look like a sunday picnic.\n \n Rev 13:10 \n He who leads into captivity shall go into captivity; he who kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.\n Rev 13:11 \n Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon.\n Rev 13:12 \n And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.\n Rev 13:13 \n He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men.\n Rev 13:14 \n And he deceives those[fn5] who dwell on the earth by those signs which he was granted to do in the sight of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword and lived.\n Rev 13:15 \n He was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.\n Rev 13:16 \n He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads,\n Rev 13:17 \n and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or[fn6] the name of the beast, or the number of his name.\n Rev 13:18 \n Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666.[/FONT][/SIZE][/INDENT]\n The beast in verse 11 is about the false prophet, or religious half of the first beast who will enforce the new religion of the dragon/antichrist. He will do miracles like calling fire down from heaven and the unsaved will worship the beast because of this power.He will have a statue of antichrist built and will bring it to life as one of his miracles. All who refuse to worship it will be killed. This is also when the mark of the beast will be forced on all who will receive it and unless they receive it, they can't buy or sell or trade. \n \n Since no one has received a head wound, died and then resurrected from the dead, we have no idea who the AC is, or will be yet. But he will be easy to recognize given this info. I believe he will be a european myself, and will be known as a peace maker to start. Much needs to occur before the AC will be known to men though. You can believe Abbas fits the bill as the antichrist, but you haven't shown in any way that what you claim is reasonable at all.",

It is possible the second beast will who brings the false religion to worship the first beast will come from the middle east imo. \n\n \n michael777's response: \n  I knew the comments I made would force you to play your cards. I always meet someone like you everywhere I go. The hero, someone who holds the banner of Christianity and repeats all the same talking points that have been popular for the past 20 centuries. Also, I was wanting to know just how corrupted your mind was and by whom. It seems you are a Jack Van Impe type of Christian. That brand of Christianity is WATCHING in the wrong place. Prophecy is as meaningless from his perspective as a man looking on Mars for answers.\n \n  Since questions concerning prophecy never change and answers never change, a standard explanation is available to most of your questions. It will seem a little detached from the conversation, but many of your questions are answered here. Any that need more explanation I will explain. Still though, I feel it needs to be tailored just for you as has been the case so many times. \n \n In reference to Revelation 13:1- The Beast rising up out of the sea is the Nation of Israel as it appears after the SIX DAY WAR in 1967. The beast was born in 1948 with Israel declaring its independence. A closer look can be seen in Rev.17. Five nations went to war with Israel when she declared her independence and five were vanquished. The word used is fallen in verse Rev. 17:10. \"And one is\", this is Israel. Israel won her war of independence. The other that has not yet come is the Palestinian Authority, which brings us to Rev.13:1 again. \n \n An explanation of Revelation 13:1 is necessary here. A botched interpretation here will cause the whole explanation to be wrong. The beast rising up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns is as follows. Seven heads are seven mountains as indicated in Rev.17. Ten horns are ten kings. This is a partial explanation of this parable. The most critical word here is the word head. If an explanation to what a head is can be found the answer will make sense. In scriptures a mountain has two meanings. It can be either a mountain range or a nation. In this case when a head is referenced in Revelation 13:1 we are talking about a nation. The mortal head wound is the nation or land as claimed by the Palestinians. It was mortally wounded in the Six Day War and has been revived in the Oslo Accords. The beast of Revelation 17 and Revelation 13 are the same because they involve the same countries.\n \n I wrote the following narrative approximately three years ago. Very little has been changed. All other Christian explanations get altered with the wind and none of their explanations can be proven one way or the other. Therefore, they are never wrong. They just keep changing their minds. Here is that narrative.\n \n \n \n The beast of Revelation 13:1 is said to have seven heads and ten horns. The ten horns are ten kings Rev. 17:12. The seven heads are seven mountains Rev. 17:9. These kings shall have power with the beast and give their power and strength to him for one hour. Who would argue that the beast nations of Rev: 13 do not exist today and that for a person to know who they are one must be in heaven or raptured first? Of course we know who some of them are it is common sense. Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Iran to name just a few. The problem with the interpretation of Rev. 13 is what the seven heads are. Many have said that they are hills that pertain to a specific city. Particularly Rome which is supposed to sit on seven hills which would somehow make the Vatican the seat of the anti-christ. Which countries in Europe do you suppose are going to attack Israel and join with the beast of Rev. 13? I'm here to say that none of them will. The only possibility is that the beast is from Europe and he leads a confederation of Muslim nations against Israel. Before I get to what are the seven heads of Rev. 13 something else must also be included here. The beast is supposed to have subdued or plucked up three of the ten kings, Dan.7. Why does the beast subdue himself or eliminate three of those who are thought to be on his side? The answer is that Rev. 13 is not only a picture of the Muslim nations but also of Israel. The three kings subdued by beast number one are from Israel. So if the beast of Rev.13 has ten kings but three are not with him that leaves seven kings who must be. If a study of the word mountains is done in the Bible a pattern will emerge. Mountains can also be a nation or nations. Therefore seven heads are seven mountains and the seven mountains of Rev. 13 are nations, Muslim nations. These seven nations are Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Jordan and Egypt. The ten kings are all the present rulers of these countries plus the three that are subdued by Arafat. These are Peres, Netanyahu and Barak. That makes ten. Arafat is the little horn, which is the eleventh, and represents the land of Palestine. Collectively these nations compose the beast of Revelation 13 with Arafat as their leader. The covenant of Daniel 9:27 was between Arafat and Rabin in Sept. 1993. It was the Oslo Accords and lasted until Sept. 2000 with the start of the Palestinian uprising. The translation of the word many in Daniel 9:27 is Rab.The three kings subdued by the beast all happened during the seven years of the Oslo Accords. It was written in Israeli newspapers that Arafat was proud to say he affected the elections in Israel three times. Every time a terrorist incident occurred the Israeli public would vote in someone else. Another parable that shows Arafat is the beast of Rev. 13 is verse 3. One of his heads is wounded to death and the deadly wound is healed. This word head refers to a nation. Seven heads are seven mountains and seven mountains are seven nations. The deadly head [Nation] wound is the land taken by Israel in the 1967 war and wanted by the Arabs for a Palestinian homeland. As land is given back to the Arabs through negotiation it is being healed. Arafat was able to operate for three in a half years and in the middle of the 7 years negotiations failed culminating in the uprising in Sept. 2000. WOE \n \n \n Archangel's interpetation of Revelation 13:\n Verse 3 is key to us recognizing the ac when he does arrive. How? Because he will receive a mortal, meaning fatal head wound, probably an assassination attempt by someone who recognizes him as the ac. But he will be healed, I believe after 3 days, duplicating the resurrection of Christ and the world will follow him. Obviously this hasn't happened yet so Abbas can't be linked through this verse.\n \n The Dragon is satan, and the beast is antichrist. verse 4 is saying that the dragon will be worshiped as will the beast. So the beast is leading the unsaved to the dragon as he gains political clout Verse 5 shows that he will be given authority for 42 months, or 3 1/2 years. Half the tribulation period when it is shown that he will draw the world together in a pseudo type of peace.\n \n At verse 6 is the start of the second half of the 7 year tribulation. He will desecrate the Holy of Holies in the newly rebuilt 3rd Temple of David in Jerusalem. This is called the abomination of desolation and is when the Jew will finally have the spiritual scales removed from his eyes and see not only antichrist for who he is, but will see that Jesus is Messiah. Verses 7,8 and 9 speak to his war to silence all believers at that time and to force the world to worship him. This will be the start of the darkest time in History and the carnage will make the holocaust look like a sunday picnic.\n \n The beast in verse 11 is about the false prophet, or religious half of the first beast who will enforce the new religion of the dragon/antichrist. He will do miracles like calling fire down from heaven and the unsaved will worship the beast because of this power.He will have a statue of antichrist built and will bring it to life as one of his miracles. All who refuse to worship it will be killed. This is also when the mark of the beast will be forced on all who will receive it and unless they receive it, they can't buy or sell or trade. \n \n Since no one has received a head wound, died and then resurrected from the dead, we have no idea who the AC is, or will be yet.

   " \n I knew the comments I made would force you to play your cards. I always meet someone like you everywhere I go. The hero, someone who holds the banner of Christianity and repeats all the same talking points that have been popular for the past 20 centuries. Also, I was wanting to know just how corrupted your mind was and by whom. It seems you are a Jack Van Impe type of Christian. That brand of Christianity is WATCHING in the wrong place. Prophecy is as meaningless from his perspective as a man looking on Mars for answers.\n\n \n Oh yes, you trapped me like a rabbit in a snare michael. emoticon_rolleyes Well, since it's games you want to play rather than discuss and actually learn from each other what God intends us to know, I choose not to play your childish game. The link and explanation I posted above is self evident and needs no further defense. If that is beyond you to comprehend, then I feel sorry for you. \n \n I will say one thing about your response though as one last chance to correct your serious error, and that is regarding this: \n \nIn reference to Revelation 13:1- The Beast rising up out of the sea is the Nation of Israel as it appears after the SIX DAY WAR in 1967. The beast was born in 1948 with Israel declaring its independence.\n\n \n You are so spiritually blind to the truth that you're saying that Israel, Gods chosen people are the beast/antichrist of revelation. A more deluded belief is unimaginable. And I wont even give my opinion to refute you since the bible itself refutes you at every level, even in the book of revelation itself which you're holding up as evidence of your sick and anti-Semitic interpretation.\n \n Now, before letting the passages in dark red speak for themselves without any comment from me, let me ask you about this covenant that God made with Abraham regarding him and his descendants. In order for you to believe that Israel is the antichrist that is foretold throughout the bible as the father of lies and the evil one, then you must believe that God Himself knowingly made a covenant with her through Abraham who was the father of Israel as the first in the line and the Patriarch of all Jews. And that Jesus Christ came from the bloodline that would become antichrist. Is that really what you believe? Gen 17:7 \n \"And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and your descendants after you.\n Gen 17:8 \n \"Also I give to you and your descendants after you the land in which you are a stranger, all the land of Canaan,(Israel) as an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.\"=======================================================================================================\n Rom 11:25 \n For I do not desire, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own opinion, that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.\n \n Rom 11:26 \n And so all Israel will be saved,[fn6] as it is written:\n \"The Deliverer will come out of Zion,\n And He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob;\n \n Rom 11:27 \n For this is My covenant with them,\n When I take away their sins.\"[fn7]\n \n Rom 11:28 \n Concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but concerning the election they are beloved for the sake of the fathers.\n =======================================================================================================\n Rev 7:4 And I heard the number of those who were sealed. One hundred and forty-four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel were sealed:\n =======================================================================================================\n Rev 21:12 Also she had a great and high wall with twelve gates, and twelve angels at the gates, and names written on them, which are [the names] of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:\n Ask yourself why the names of the 12 Tribes of Israel would be written on the Gates of New Jerusalem if Israel represents the beast/antichrist. And why would God name His Holy City after Jerusalem if it was a part of the beasts evil system? You are in serious need of theological training my friend. But I have made my point. Come back when you have some real truths to share.",

You did. I said Israel was part of \n the Beast nations. Satan is the anti-christ. He will not be revealed until \n after the Rapture of the Church. He will be kicked out of heaven as per \n Revelation 12 and 2nd Thess. Chap2. He will be a God to those left on \n Earth. He is known as the Mahdi to Muslims and he will be worshipped.\n Mahmoud Abbas will also be worshipped to a lesser degree because he \n will acheive his goal, the conquest of Jerusalem...michael777\n\n \n When you refer to Israel as the beast, you are interchangeably referring to her as antichrist because both are one and the same according to your Rev.13. \n Rev 13:2 \n Now the beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.\n Rev 13:3 \n And I saw one of his heads as if it had been mortally wounded, and his deadly wound was healed. And all the world marveled and followed the beast.\n Note the bolded: The Dragon is satan, and he gives the beast, otherwise known as antichrist, his authority and power. The beast is a person, not a Nation. He will be mortally wounded with a head wound and will be supernaturally healed. Israel is not the beast.\n \n So you're a pre trib rapture believer huh? I disagree with you and can support my belief. But please show me the scripture that say's that antichrist wont be revealed until after the rapture. I'd like to see that passage.\n \n If the Palestinians will conquer and control Jerusalem, then how will the third Temple be rebuilt when the dome of the rock mosque sits on part of its site?

Homophobia and violence are part of your creed, as are hatred and intolerance, and they are not of God. Jesus summarised the law in two commandments:\n The first commandment is this: hear, O Israel, the Lord your God is the only Lord, you will love the lord your God with all your heart, with all your mind, with all your soul and with all your strength.\n The second is this: love your neighbour as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.\n \n Many people love God even if they don't know Him that well. And many people of all faiths and none do a reasonable job of loving their neighbour. God seems to value faith more than theological doctrine, and love more than both. I don't thing Paul was far off when he wrote \"Three things shall outlast all others: faith, hope and love. And the greatest of these is love\".\n \n I'm not going to make claims about your relationship with God. I can only speak for mine, that I know is imperfect because of my human frailties. I can only try to discern through prayer, scripture and reason what it is that God wants. The Prophet Micah says:\n \"What does the Lord require of us? That we do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with our God\". I take justice, mercy and love to be more important than judgement, pointing out sin, denouncing others and trying to deny thier faith. If you cannot accept that others have a different understanding of Christianity to you, yet are still Christians, I suspect that you are going to have a real shock. emoticon_xclown\n \n If I want a historical comparison for challenging your pronouncements, I need look no further than Jesus' treatment of the pharisees.",

Jesus summarised the law in two commandments:\n The first commandment is this: hear, O Israel, the Lord your God is the only Lord, you will love the lord your God with all your heart, with all your mind, with all your soul and with all your strength.\n The second is this: love your neighbour as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.\n\n \n 1) Prove that I am homophobic in any way Jo, and especially violent! When and where have I condoned or promoted violence against anyone. Support your claims or admit that you're a liar. And regarding the first verse, Perfect. Beautiful verse and so true. Are you claiming to have ever defended, supported or endorsed the biblical passages that disagree with your preferred world view? Should I post all of the uncountable times you have sided with the atheists against me as I defended the plain and simple gospel truth? You are pulling a perfect kronus by implying that you represent that first verse at all on this forum. That means your being hypocritical Jo.\n \n And regarding the second verse, we must now define what true love is. When Jesus overturned the money changers tables in the Temple, was He hating those men or loving them? We all know how much He offended them, and how angry He was. By your thinking Jesus should have tolerated their blatant and open sin in His Fathers house. You think that loving your neighbor is tolerating their sin rather than correct them on a debate forum where honest opinions are sought. That just proves that you have no concept of what truth is and that you don't love these people at all or you would tell them the truth and defend the bible as God intended even if it hurts their feelings now. Better to offend them with the truth than to tolerate them into hell Jo, but you just can't see that, can you!\n \n \nMany people love God even if they don't know Him that well. And many people of all faiths and none do a reasonable job of loving their neighbour. God seems to value faith more than theological doctrine, and love more than both. I don't thing Paul was far off when he wrote \"Three things shall outlast all others: faith, hope and love. And the greatest of these is love\".\n\n \n Got a verse that justifies the bolded? Of course you don't. And remember where it say's that faith without works is dead? If you claim to believe but never defend Gods truth, then what is it that you believe? Nothing that God will respect or honor Jo.\n \n \nI'm not going to make claims about your relationship with God. I can only speak for mine, that I know is imperfect because of my human frailties. I can only try to discern through prayer, scripture and reason what it is that God wants. The Prophet Micah says:\n \"What does the Lord require of us? That we do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with our God\". I take justice, mercy and love to be more important than judgement, pointing out sin, denouncing others and trying to deny thier faith. If you cannot accept that others have a different understanding of Christianity to you, yet are still Christians, I suspect that you are going to have a real shock. emoticon_xclown\n\n \n Funny, you never mentioned the Holy Spirit guiding you even once in this whole paragraph. What even you don't get that if it's you seeking to follow Gods principles apart from the Holy Spirit's guidance and indwelling, then God doesn't even know you Jo. All of the nice sounding principles you mention here, I live and practice in my life. But they don't require that we abandon the word of God to accomplish that. And that is precisely what you do in every debate on religion. You side with atheists and secular humanists and attack me for defending the bible.\n \n \nIf I want a historical comparison for challenging your pronouncements, I need look no further than Jesus' treatment of the pharisees.\n\n \n WOW, You mean statements of condemnation like these?\n \n Mat 12:24 \n Now when the Pharisees heard it they said, \"This fellow does not cast out demons except by Beelzebub,[fn6] the ruler of the demons.\"\n Mat 12:25 \n But Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them: \"Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.\n Mat 12:26 \n \"If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?\n Mat 12:27 \n \"And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.\n Mat 12:28 \n \"But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, surely the kingdom of God has come upon you.\n Mat 12:29 \n \"Or how can one enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.\n Mat 12:30 \n \"He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters abroad.\n Mat 12:31 \n \"Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men.\n Mat 12:32 \n \"Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come.\n Mat 12:33 \n \"Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or else make the tree bad and its fruit bad; for a tree is known by its fruit.\n Mat 12:34 \n \"Brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.\n Mat 12:35 \n \"A good man out of the good treasure of his heart[fn7] brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things.\n Mat 12:36 \n \"But I say to you that for every idle word men may speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment.\n Mat 12:37 \n \"For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.\"\n Do you feel confident that your defense of secular humanist morals and values that directly oppose what Christ stands for is defending what is right or scriptural Jo? Do you really believe that if we stand before the Lord together, He will see me as the Pharisee? As the one who put on the appearance of righteousness, but denied the power there of? Are you really going to imply that, given that anyone here can click on our names and read all of the posts we have ever written on this forum? If you are claiming that, then the depth your denial is beyond belief.",

And SP, are you denying that Jesus Christ, our Messiah is also the Savior? Are you denying that to refer to Jesus as our Savior is to deny that He is also Messiah?

Capitalism is there because it's a lesser of evils when it comes to society and giving people an opportunity to make things better for themselves. You speak of it as if it's evil, but free trade is the only way that people can really be free. Every such system has broken down at some point--communism for sure. Capitalism is there because free trade is the best we can really do in terms of guaranteeing freedom and avoiding a 'welfare baby' state. The real enemy isn't capitalism; it's greed. And they are not synonymous. For example, Bill Gates is a capitalist, but he's probably a bigger philanthropist than is your entire government. It's just a poor way of looking at the issues to just blithely declare 'capitalism BAD.' When people are GREEDY, bad things happen, no matter what system they are in.",

Things Christ said have to be viewed along with other things he said; individual statements shouldn't really be read as an island pretending it was the ONLY thing he said. There certainly are cases where resisting an evil person is the more Christ-like thing to do. You consider Bush evil--do you really think the Christian thing to do is to not resist him? Jesus also made it clear we should love our neighbors, take care of widows and orphans, etc. Sometimes resisting an evil person is the only way to guarantee welfare of people who can't care for themselves.\n \n During WWII, there was a movement to assassinate Hitler, and some of the Christian leaders like Dietrich Bonhoeffer went through enormous personal conflict over whether this was ok or not. Of course with your broad over-simplified view, it would not be ok to resist Hitler. But Bonhoeffer came to the conclusion that it was the more Christian thing to do, because it would ultimately help others far more to do so and probably save many, many lives. He joined in the plot, but they were caught and he was executed by the Nazis along with numerous others over it.\n \n Christian love and political pacifism are not necessarily the same concept.",

And I will prove it! But regarding your slanted and incorrect doctrinal perspective, Jesus was speaking to individuals and how we respond to an \"EVIL PERSON\" not an evil nation or group that has declared war on and attacked our National Security on the Homefront. You confuse individual responsibility with National responsibility to protect the people from a common enemy that seeks to destroy us. Here is sadams track record and what the iraqi people would still be suffering had we allowed him to continue in his rampage of human carnage, but as usual, as a selfish socialist you are blind to that which you don't have to see every night on the News.\n \n The mass graves were invisible so they don't bother you. The childrens prison was unknown so why care about their suffering. 24 million people welcomed the coalition with the hope of a fair government and an opportunity to live in peace, and even now after 5 years of terrorist insurgents killing innocent iraqi's with bombs and beheadings and you still have the nerve to blame us for standing against these demonic forces who have no qualms about using terrorism and the most brutal techniques imaginable in order to break the spirits of the good people who just seek peace and safety in their lives.

Here's my evidence that your original claim is a blatant LIE!!!\n Saddam Hussein\n \n Full name Saddam Hussein al-Majid al-Tikriti. AKA 'Great Uncle', AKA 'Lion of Babylon', AKA 'Lion of Iraq', AKA 'Beast of Baghdad'. Saddam translates to 'One Who Confronts'.\n \n Country: Iraq.\n \n Kill tally: Approaching two million, including between 150,000 and 340,000 Iraqi and between 450,000 and 730,000 Iranian combatants killed during the Iran-Iraq War. An estimated 1,000 Kuwaiti nationals killed following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. No conclusive figures for the number of Iraqis killed during the Gulf War, with estimates varying from as few as 1,500 to as many as 200,000. Over 100,000 Kurds killed or \"disappeared\". \n No reliable figures for the number of Iraqi dissidents and Shia Muslims killed during Hussein's reign, though estimates put the figure between 60,000 and 150,000. (Mass graves discovered following the US occupation of Iraq in 2003 suggest that the total combined figure for Kurds, Shias and dissidents killed could be as high as 300,000). Approximately 500,000 Iraqi children dead because of international trade sanctions introduced following the Gulf War.\n http://www.moreorless.au.com/killers/hussein.html\n \nAs for breaking into discussions, you frequently break into discussions to condemn homosexuality, whether you are asked about it or not. And you have started threads condemning homosexuality, but never any criticising divorce. It's odd really, given that Jesus actually talked about divorce, but didn't mention homosexuality once.\n\n \n But they are discussions in the gay rights forum or religious discussions that are speaking about homosexuality. Start a thread about divorce and I would be happy to discuss it from a scriptural perspective. \n \n \nYour advocacy of capitalism is clearly in contradiction with Christ's command to love your neighbour.

You support the legislation of religious views, when Christ said \"render unto Caesar what belongs to Caesar\".\n\n \n And yet, on any day of any given week of any given year we have foreigners flying into the USA for medical care from Countries that offer socialized medicine. WEIRD HUH? Why is that Jo? Could it be that free care isn't worth much if the patient dies before their name comes up on the roster to finally get treated for their disease? \n \n It has been proven time and time again in Canada that for a simple, yet very necessary $5,000.00 hernia operation, a man will miss 9 months of work with tax payer supported 2/3rds pay and social benefits, as his company must bring in an pay a temporary worker to take his place on his job which the State also subsidizes partially, costing additional tens of thousands of dollars to the health costs while he is just sitting home waiting for his operation date to come up. All this for a 4 hour operation that any doctor in America would have scheduled for the next day and had the patient back to work within 1 week. How is socialized medicine efficient or beneficial to the patient at all when you apply that scenario to cancer and other life threatening diseases? Just check the mortality rates between the US and any Country you like that practices socialized medicine. And please Jo, use per capita statistics and not just raw numbers as we are comparing our population of 300 million people to much smaller populations that use socialized medicine. \n \n \nYou are more interested in conforming to the views of the so-called Christian Right than you are in following what Christ actually said.\n \n \"as you turn a blind eye toward true and real suffering by millions of people.\"\n \n Where have you been in the campaigns for trade justice?

How blind you are to the realities of the suffering in Countries at the other end of the political spectrum Jo. True capitalism allows for individual accomplishments based on creativity and dedication. These are human ideals and characteristics that have made America the beacon of light and freedom in a dark and oppressive World. This is the reason we have become the great melting pot, the final destination for the oppressed people from every continent on Earth who were seeking equality, hope and an opportunity for a better life. But you conveniently forget that reality as you seek to condemn what we stand for at every turn. Explain why so many seek to get here if we epitomize the worst of what this world offers?",

Fact is that a hernia patient in the US likely won't get treated at all unless they have insurance, and even then they may find themselves with an extortionate bill. And don't even think about trying to get insurance with an existing medical problem. If my parents lived in the US my Dad wouldn't be able to get insurance and consequently would never be able to work again because he couldn't afford the medication needed.\n \n People try to get to the US because capitalism gathers wealth and prosperity into one or a small number of places. Capitalism has impoverished most of the countries on earth to enrich America's elites, to the extent that the crumbs falling off the table of the rich in the US are better than what western corporations have left to the rest of the world. The WTO and World Bank rules have crippled any chance of prosperity in developing countries, aided and abetted by western corporations with the collaboration of western government.

   "Slick way to change the subject. What does infant mortality have to do with overall healthcare? And the numbers you posted didn't match the link you posted, why's that? \n \n Any way, at the bottom of my links page are additional links regarding your very flawed British system of socialized health care. So please don't try to force what is failing for you, on me.\n I once believed in the lofty goal of \"universal health care\". Who wouldn't support that goal? Doesn't everyone have a \"right\" to health care?\n It was easy to agree with a meaningless campaign promise such as \"Affordable Health Care for All\". It takes effort to research the topic and understand economic reasoning and history.\n \n Once I questioned the sound bites, I realized that government intervention in the market (e.g., Medicare, FDA regulations, physician licensing, insurance regulations) is the reason for artificially high health care prices.\n \n So-called Universal Healthcare amplifies all problems:\n \n 1) Reduces patient incentives to find the best possible prices for the best possible services/products available.\n Patients in the U.S. who receive \"free\" (taxpayer-funded) health care have no incentive to conserve their health care dollars. Care is \"free\" so they visit the doctor's office several times a month or request \"free\" prescriptions for over-the-counter medication such as Tylenol.\n \n 2) Reduces physician incentives to provide competitive care and reduces drug companies' incentives to provide new drugs and treatments.\n With no incentive to provide quality care, physicians and nurses leave the government-monopolized area for better opportunities in a freer country. Shortages result. Drug companies are hindered by price controls and regulations and soon cease research and development of new medication. In the U.S., start-up drug companies cannot afford to run the FDA gauntlet, so the market is dominated by a few established corporations.\n \n 3) Steals from your wallet to pay for my health care. \n Yes, you do have a right to health care, just as you have a right to food, shelter and property. However, you have no \"right\" to force others to provide these things for you - All \"free\" medical care is subsidized through taxes stolen from other people.\n \n 4) The quality of \"free\" health care will deteriorate and the average citizen will get sicker.\n As the poor and middle-class wait in agony for simple procedures, those with resources can travel to other countries for treatment.\n \n 5) Destroys your privacy.\n Suddenly your problems are mine and mine are yours. If you eat unhealthy foods or drive a motorcycle without a helmet, I have a direct interest in your business - you are going to see a provider on my tax dollars. Your neighbors might support government bans on smoking, \"unsafe\" sex or other \"risky\" behaviors to reduce costs. Politicians will use the federal bureaucracy to force you and your family to comply with programs such as the \"New Freedom Commission on Mental Health\".\n \n 6) Destroys your liberty.\n When you blindly support a system that bestows power on politicians and bureaucrats, they will receive their orders from those with the most money - and this will not be you, your friends or your family. The power of government will be used against you as you are forced to use medicines or accept treatments from well-connected health care companies.\n \n A quick search shows that pharmaceutical companies donated $152,437,727 to political campaigns since 1990. Who do you think has the ear of those elected politicians?\n \n Conversely, if government power is eliminated (e.g., abolish the FDA - whose restrictions benefit the most powerful companies by eliminating most competition), those same companies would have to use their funds and resources to sell their drugs to the most people in the least expensive, most reliable and safest way. They would need to outperform their competitors to get your money - otherwise they lose business.\n \n Most links below direct you to newspaper articles from different established sources and different countries, including the New York Times, the BBC, the Daily Mail, ABC or CNN. These articles show widespread problems such as physician shortages or increased waiting times that are inevitable when businesses are monopolized by the government.\n \n Other links below direct you to articles from free-market institutes and groups. The authors use facts and logic to explain the superiority of the free-market process when compared to government bureaucracies. You can dismiss these links as \"libertarian propaganda\" or you can read the reports and question your own emotionally-based opinion, as I did. Please see Harry Browne's excellent Compassion of the mind and ask yourself if you are hurting others with your socialism. \n \n \n \n Great Britain\n [Top]\n Great Britain's National Health Service (NHS) was created on July 5, 1948. As with all government programs, bureaucrats underestimated initial cost projections. First-year operating costs of NHS were 52 million pounds higher than original estimates1 as Britons saturated the so-called free system.\n Many decades of shortages, misery and suffering followed until 1989, when some market-based health care competition was reintroduced to the British citizens2.\n \n Unfortunately for those requiring care, a mostly socialist health care system still has problems. The articles and commentaries in this section identify some disasters caused by government intervention in the British health care system.\n \n Heart patients dying due to poor hospital care, says report\n - Sarah Boseley, June 8, 2008 [Guardian Unlimited]\n NHS dentistry loses almost a million patients after new dentists' contract\n - David Rose, June 6, 2008 [The Times]\n Private healthcare managers could be sent to turn round failing NHS hospitals\n - Philip Webster, Political Editor, and David Rose, June 4, 2008 [The Times]\n Cancer patients 'betrayed' by NHS\n - Sarah-Kate Templeton, June 1, 2008 [The Times]\n NHS scandal: dying cancer victim was forced to pay\n - Sarah-Kate Templeton, June 1, 2008 [The Times]\n Pensioner, 76, forced to pull out own teeth after 12 NHS dentists refuse to treat her\n - Olinka Koster, March 26, 2008 [Daily Mail(UK)]\n Dental patients face care lottery\n - March 26, 2008 [Metro(UK)]\n Lung patients 'condemned to death as NHS withdraws their too expensive drugs'\n - Jenny Hope, March 24, 2008 [Daily Mail(UK)]\n Women in labour turned away by maternity units\n - John Carvel, March 21, 2008 [Guardian Unlimited]\n \n http://www.angelfire.com/pa/sergeman/issues/healthcare/socialized.html",

   "Do you want me to pull out the list of horror stories about uninsured and underinsured Americans? No-one in this country, not even the tories, seriously thinks private insurance would be better than the NHS. The claims of more frequent GP trips are spurious, and given that prescriptions are still charged (\u00a37, but no more than \u00a390 a year if you need a lot of medication) the free precription thing doesn't apply. Despite this supposed profligacy, UK healthcare costs are considerably lower, around 8% of GDP as opposed to 13.5%. I'd like to see us spending the same proportion of GDP, and given we already get better infant mortality and longevity, think how much better it will be when we spend more! Infant mortality is an excellent indicator of the quality of ante-natal, neo-natal, and maternity care. Failures in any of these lead to high infant mortality. At a guess I would say it's the ante-natal where the US is falling down - i.e. non-emergency care for those who aren't insured.\n \n As for the other claims in your cut and paste, healthcare in the UK has improved dramatically since 1948.",

   "Slight correction here; Prescriptions are free if you are on benefits or live in Wales. I suspect that Scotland also provides free prescriptions but you'd probably have to research that, or ask BBS.\n The major \"problem\" we experience as regards healthcare is people claiming Incapacity Benefit without actually needing it, though that is a problem with the DSS rather than the NHS.\n\n \n True, I'd forgotten about the changes in Wales, but in any case the supposed problems have failed to materialise.\n \n Incapacity benefit is a bit of a mess because it was abused by the previous tory government to hide its destruction of industry in the north of England and south Wales, and at the same time is very difficult to get today if you do have a genuine problem.",
