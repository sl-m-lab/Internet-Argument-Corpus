   "I'm sure one of you math mavens can help me with a simple problem.\n \n Examine the following: http://www.josephdphillips.com/wing2.xls\n \n This is a spreadsheet that calculates the per-mile cost of operating each of my three vehicles.\n \n What I'd like to know is:\n \n How much would the price of gas have to go up before my cost per mile for the GL1800 (motorcycle, 42 mpg) is the same as the total cost per mile for the Tacoma (pickup truck, 28 mpg)?\n \n I can get the answer by putting in different values in cell B1 until I get a match between c12 and c20. $6.335 works.\n \n I was hoping to put a formula in an empty cell that calculates this value, even if I change the other variables (cost of tires per mile, etc.)\n \n I hope this makes sense. Can anyone here do the math?",
