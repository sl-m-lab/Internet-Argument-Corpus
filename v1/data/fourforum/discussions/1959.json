   "I coach little league. Let me start with that. I've been coaching for 4 years. Im the only tattoed , \"the clash\" t-shirt wearing coach in the league. But I love baseball....I grew up with Mickey Mantle, Vida Blue, Tom Seaver, Johnny Bench, saw Willie mays play with the Mets, saw pete rose (hated him, loved the big red machine era) and \"the Mick\" play, met willie stargell (some of my heroes) I've seen a Mark MaCGwire homer during the Sosa rivalry, seen Nolan Ryan pitch, Rickie Henderson steal two bases....I could go on and on...\n \n I'm not happy with the way this steroid thing is going. I love baseball. I think the problem is the obsession with the home run. But, here's the deal....\n \n This is my idea on how to save baseball. ***** the homerun. I've never cared for that anyway.\n To me, the consistent singles hitter/utility player is a much more exiciting guy. He hits lead off. He steals. He's fast. He , seemingly, has no ego. He just plays.What was the most exciting moment in the Red sox /Yankees series last year. It was Posada's double.Catch my drift?\n And....\n What about the pitching? Wasn't that a major factor in that series? Isn't baseball ALL about the team with the best pitchers. That's where the strategy erupts. That's where it get's exciting. \n So....focus on the pitchers. Who was more exciting than Nolan Ryan? Sandy Koufax? Andy Pettite, who seemed on the verge of having the game collapse around him every second he was on the mound. But, he held it together. Or think about the Marlins pitching last year. That wasn't impressive? Are you kidding me? That's baseball.\n Forget the homerun. Look at Sosa and the Cubs. How much has his home runs helped them?\n \n Baseball has some really intricate strategies that may not appeal to everyone the way a home run blast does. But, try it. It will grow on people if they start to get it. They use to. They could again.\n \n \n __________________\n My urgent advice to you would be, not only to always think first of America, but always, also, to think first of humanity.\" --- President Woodrow Wilson\n \n \"By oft repeating an untruth, men come to believe it themselves.\" --Thomas Jefferson\n \n \n Last edited by DMann on 03-17-2004 at 11:55 AM",

   "I am not an American, but isn't the whole steroid and food-add-on stuff a problem in American sports in general?\n I heard this from several people who did a school exchange and one guy told me, he felt like the youngest in his Basketball team although he was 17 and the other players were 15-16. But thanks to all the pills from the various shops in the malls (lots of this stuff is regarded as doping here where I live) they appeared broader and more mature for their age.\n The side-effects were never mentioned by the consumers however (maybe they didn't even know).",
