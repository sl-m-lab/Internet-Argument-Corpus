   "I looked it up. The word day in Gen 1 refers to either a period from sunset to sunset or it refers to an age. (two most commin hebrew usages. Therefore we look to the context for further evidence. The same chapter talks about a morning and an evening as a day. (I think I may have those in reverse order). Those words are unmbiguous in the hebrew and refer to dawn and sunset. Therefore, I believe the bible means a literal 6 days.\n \n Reference: Strongs Exhaustive Concordance",

   "I've lifted this from another forum I wrote on about this subject\n \n \n Can Christians have an allegorical approach to Genesis? \n You could, but then, why did Jesus come to save Man? \"If one is to vigorously and consistently maintains that Jesus Christ is the unique Savoir Who has brought salvation to a world in need of salvation, one obviously must know what is the nature of the need which provoked this salvation. (St. Athanasius, De Incarnatione Verbi Dei, 4) It would, indeed, seem foolish to have medical doctors trained to heal sickness if there were no such thing as sickness in the world. Likewise, a savoir who claims to save people in need of no salvation is a savoir only unto himself.\" http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/inquirers/frjr_sin.htm \n This 'sickness' then is sin. It is ancestral sin,* the sin committed by Adam. \"And behold, as you see, the sentence of God remains forever as an eternal chastisement...For this reason the Almighty Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, came so as to humble Himself in place of Adam.\" (St. Symeon the New Theologian \"The First-Created Man\", p44). \n \"The sin committed by our progenitors in paradise, with all its consequences, passed and passes from them to all their posterity. What the first people became after the Fall, such also till now are their descendants in the world. \"Adam begat a son in his own likeness, after his image\" (Genesis 5:3, KJV). Estrangement from God, the loss of grace, the distortion of God's image, the perversion and weakening of the bodily organism, which ends with death - here is Adam's sad legacy, received by each of us at our very appearance in the world. \"As from an infected source there naturally flows an infected stream,\" teaches the Orthodox catechism, \"so from an ancestor infected with sin, and hence mortal, there naturally proceeds a posterity infected with sin, and hence mortal.\" http://www.stjohndc.org/Homilies/9609a.htm \n \"Therefore, just as through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men (Romans 5:12 ).\" By refusing communion with God, Adam cut himself off from the Source of Life. Having separated himself from God, Adam, in a sense, starved his nature from the gifts of God. Because man was given dominion over all creation, St. Paul insists that all of creation has fallen as well.(Original Sin, p 2 as quoted on http://www.akins.org/matthew/paul.html#tthFtNtACH) \n \"Undoubtedly, one of the most important causes of heresy is the failure to understand the exact nature of the human situation described by the Old and New Testaments, to which the historical events of the birth, teachings, death, resurrection and second coming of Christ are the only remedy. The failure to understand this automatically implies a perverted understanding of what it is that Christ did and continues to do for us, and what our subsequent relation is to Christ and neighbour within the realm of salvation. The importance of a correct definition of original sin and its consequences can never be exaggerated. Any attempt to minimize its importance or alter its significance automatically entails either a weakening or even a complete misunderstanding of the nature of the Church, sacraments and human destiny.\" http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/inquirers/frjr_sin.htm. Thus, it is meaningless, or worse still utterly wrong to downplay the relationships established in Genesis. It is the beginning of the story of Man, and the story of Man's sin. Without it, why would Jesus come to us? \n This is not a novel approach to reading Genesis, in fact it is the allegorical approach that is novel! Countless Christian thinkers have throughout the centuries held to the literal truth... \n \"No on should think that the Creation of Six Days is an allegory\" said St Ephraim the Syrian \n St. Basil the Great in his Hexatemeron says \"Therefore, let it be understood as it has been written.\" \n St.Macarius the Great of Egypt in commenting on Genesis 3:24 said \"This is a passage which many of us might have expected to have only a mystical meaning, but this great seer of Divine things assures us that is is also true \"just as it is written\" for those capable of seeing it.\" (pp85-6 Seraphim Rose \"Genesis, Creation and Early Man: The Orthodox Christian Vision) \n *Properly speaking, the phrase ``original sin'' is not generally used by Eastern Fathers or contemporary Orthodox theologians. This phrase was introduced by St. Augustine in his polemics against Pelagians. The phrase continued to be used, primarily in the west, to denote the idea of ``original guilt.'' \n Eastern theologians have long preferred the phrase ``ancestral sin,'' which connotes the sin of our first ancestor, Adam. The term was used to denote \"the sin of Adam, which was transmitted to his descendants and weighs upon them\" or ``sin-sickness.'' \n http://www.akins.org/matthew/paul.html \n Further... \"With regard to original sin, the difference between Orthodox Christianity and the West may be outlined as follows: \n In the Orthodox Faith, the term \"original sin\" refers to the \"first\" sin of Adam and Eve. As a result of this sin, humanity bears the \"consequences\" of sin, the chief of which is death. Here the word \"original\" may be seen as synonymous with \"first.\" Hence, the \"original sin\" refers to the \"first sin\" in much the same way as \"original chair\" refers to the \"first chair.\" \n In the West, humanity likewise bears the \"consequences\" of the \"original sin\" of Adam and Eve. However, the West also understands that humanity is likewise \"guilty\" of the sin of Adam and Eve. The term \"Original Sin\" here refers to the condition into which humanity is born, a condition in which guilt as well as consequence is involved. \n In the Orthodox Christian understanding, while humanity does bear the consequences of the original, or first, sin, humanity does not bear the personal guilt associated with this sin. Adam and Eve are guilty of their wilful action; we bear the consequences, chief of which is death. \n http://www.oca.org/pages/orth_chri/Q-and-A_OLD/St-Augustine-and-Original-Sin.html\n \n Also from the same post... why I argue what I'm arguing\n Evolution's argument comprises; \n a) it denies God's proper place in the universe and the creation \n b) it denies the relationship of the first-created Man, and thence Original Sin \n c) it denies the real reason Jesus Christ came to earth - that concerned with Adam's fall. \n d) it posits itself as a truth when it is not; instead it changes at the whim of scientists and their foibles. \n e) it suggests that Man is the ultimate font of wisdom, and that if you don't believe in evolution you are irrational (and if you believe in religion you are irrational).\n \n But for clarification...I had to write this...\n a) Sure I understand that you can have a mathematical theory doesn't mention God, therefore it excludes God. I haven't quite expressed myself the correct way in this. God already has a place in the formation of life and the universe. The Bible gives this to Him (because it recognises the truth of the matter). Evolutionary theory displaces God... by not mentioning Him. It is not giving Him the glory of His achievements. By saying that it happened without Him, it is displacing Him. \n In theory, evolutionary theory just deals with how different species come about. In theory it has nothing to do with abiogenesis, or the formation of planets... But, as practiced by evolutionaries, it is an atheistic mantra for putting religion down. I have quoted a number of sources on other posts particularly Dawkins who uses it against God.",
