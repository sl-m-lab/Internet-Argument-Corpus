   "(Where the streets are lined with Perverts, Murderers and Rapists)\n \n Inside The Mind of Our Prime Minister\n \n \"My name is Tony Blair. I am the prime-minister of Britain. And kisser of America's fat-cat, fried chicken eating, Arab hating arse. My word is Law. BUT I am a racist, sexist, arrogant, self-loving, commoner-loathing pig, but still I have been in charge of your sad country for two terms, and there is nothing you can do about it... Well, except vote for another party, but who's going to do that!? The Conservatives, well, they are a bunch of incompetent bastards, led by an even bigger sap than the rest of you! They are all for the country, and believe we should give MORE money to schools and hospitals! I mean what do they do with the 4 billion pounds we give them out of those poor fools known as the taxpayer's money! Don't we do enough?! So what we have a shortage of teachers? Kids a pay so little attention at school anyway that it's a waste of money giving them the chance to an education?! The state of hospitals? Well that isn't my fault. They're full of little women trying to make big differences as nurses, but moaning that they don't get enough money. Message to you all, YOU'RE ONLY THERE TO MAKE PEOPLE BETTER - GET ON WITH IT! I'm not giving you a 'pay-rise' I couldn't care less about the 'cost of living expense'. Shut up and work. That goes to all you teachers, fire-men and postal workers. Stop striking! You're just losing money by not working and 'making a stand'. It's not getting you anywhere, except the dole line.\n \n People say that Britain is becoming a 'mini-America' - and why not? America is a great role model! I mean it is a great leader; its judicial system is fair and just. We should learn from them, and praise their efforts of world-peace, rather than focusing on the so-called mistakes. The war in Iraq for example. I believe that Saddam was a madman who used reverse-psychology to make us believe he was of no threat to the world. And cleverly concealed his weapons of mass-destruction, to make it seem as if we were mistaken, and unfairly invading their 'innocent land'. Innocent my arse. They deserved everything they got. Who cares that hundreds of civilians were injured and killed. They are all as bad as each other, that lot. You know. The Arabs. I know they are taking all your jobs. I know they are swarming to our country. What can we do but accept them with open arms, and pay them peanuts for the jobs you don't want to do for less than 40K a year? They don't know the difference anyway, do they!?\"\n \n Outside The Mind of Our Prime Minister\n \n As you can see, we don't have a very high opinion of our 'beloved' Prime Minister Tony Blair. And with his recent affairs, who does?! Come on, admit it, you've all thought like that about him at some point. It's just that no-one has had the balls to speak out. Well, until now. We are two 16-year-old girls from a small town in the South of England, and supposedly 'We Are the Future'. That is, according to the Government. So, we thought, being the 'Future', we should let him know our real opinions! And here they are (as if you hadn't already got an idea from the above!).\n \n To be honest, sometimes I feel a little sorry for Mr. Blair. I mean, with his lips being constantly stuck to George .W. Bush's arse, and having all our money, it must be so hard being him (!) I feel for him, but I'm sure all the honest taxpayers' money can dry his tears!\n \n What has he done for us? Apart from destroying our UN relations and leaving our Health and Education system in ruins, not a lot! Not to mention transport! Our trains and roads are less efficient than he is, and that's saying something! What have we done do deserve such an incompetent 'leader'. How the hell does somebody like that get into a job where the whole state of the country lies in his money-grabbing hands?! Maybe I should fill out an application!\n \n So, our country is in a state of despair. Not enough teachers, nurses, doctors, GP's, postal workers, labourers, firemen, police officers, the list goes on! So what are the people doing with their lives? We have to admit, it's not all his fault, a lot of the country seem to be sitting on their arses living off benefits (and ready meals) which the other, hard-working, people of Britain are paying for from their extortionate taxes. OK, so not all the unemployed people are lazy, but a large percentage are. Does the Government really think that cutting back on funds for education is going to help? And as for truanting, maybe more money would lead to a more interesting education, which would result in more people getting the qualifications to be teachers, nurses, doctors etc.\n \n It seems, in the eyes of the law, money is more important than life. You may think this is a harsh conclusion to come to, but take for example the case of that little boy who was killed in a tragic hit-and-run by a man with no licence, no insurance, and no actual knowledge of driving. The man received only six months imprisonment. A man who extorts money, or is fraudulent, will receive a minimum sentence of fourteen years. Manslaughter is only worth five. What does this say about our judicial system? It says that we as a nation are more concerned about our money then of the welfare of our citizens. Another example of our leader's money-driven attitude is the fact that when war was first being discussed in the House of Lords, we were more concerned with breaking our oil connections in Iraq, than we were with killing countless innocent civilians. It's unbelievable, isn't it!?\n \n Well, you had better believe it. It's happening this very moment, in front of our, until now closed eyes... Hopefully we have opened a few. And raised a few eye-brows in the process. We're not here to 'slag off' the Prime Minister, but we just feel that he isn't doing enough for us! There is something we can do though. We need to let him know how we feel...\n \n Please E-mail us if you wish to share your opinions with us. Thankyou from Lucy and Diane.",

You people are lucky to live in a country that stands up to terrorism instead of cowering in the corner and giving in to terrorist aggression. You at least are free. You think Spain and France are free...just wait until the terrorists find more needs within these countries, they will blow something else up until they roll over like cowering dogs again (actually, France remains in this position for matter of convienience). Yes, supporting the US led war on terrorism may make you targets, but freedom does not come without a price. I wonder if you ever think about the price paid by many Americans (including my grandfather) that kept you free 60 years ago. Remember, you could be speaking German right now. I am not in any way saying that you owe us something, as most do with that argument, just that there is a price to laying down and slinking into the corner.

However there is no valid opposition, as the Tories don't really stand a chance of winning the next election.\n \n Personally I have been pretty much the opposite. When he came to power I found him very dishonest and untrustworthy. However despite the fact that I don't agree with everything he did over Iraq, I have gained a lot of respect for him. He risked loosing massive support from the public and alienation from his own party over what he did, but still stuck by doing what he thought was right. As I say I respect the man a lot for that.\n \n \n \nI wonder if you ever think about the price paid by many Americans (including my grandfather) that kept you free 60 years ago.

Because I find that argument very annoying. What about the Brits who died to keep us free, does America owe Britain something because of that? Do we owe Russia? What of the French resistance, civilians who risked all to keep us free? Does the US and Britain owe them because of that? No. We were the allies, I really hate the 'we saved you in the war' attitude that I tend to meet from some Americans. The war would have gone very differently without any of us, no nation won it single-handedly and no nation can claim the others owe them anything because of their role in doing what was right.\n \n Sorry, didn't mean to rant there, it's just a pet peeve! :)\n \n And I also assure you that the Brits are well aware of terrorism ourselves. Just because we've not been hit by ME terrorists doesn't mean we've not been facing frequently from the IRA.",

   "Phunt, as an American I have nothing but respect for the British in WW2. The US didn't win the war alone, it was the Allies. The thing is though, most of France rolled over without a fight, and though they did have military forces which resisted and some civilians which also resisted quite heroically, the majority of the French population just accepted German rule, and when thousands of Americans and British died in Normandy to give them back their freedom, they weren't appreciative. They didn't try to help the Allies, or aid them. Hell, some of them continued to help the Germans. Compare this with people like the Dutch, who risked everything to come out and help Americans and British when the were shot down, or helped them in Market Garden, etc etc. A problem that a lot of Americans have is that the French now complain about the US all the time, but they don't respect what we've done to try and help them. They don't owe us, no, but if I had been freed by them when they didn't have to go to war, I'd be respectful of them.",

But this does not mean we shouldn't say what we think is right ourselves, it's not a lack of respect it's about saying and doing what one personally feels to be right.\n \n \n Why did the US enter Iraq? Despite all the cynicism in the end it was because they did what they thought was right. Should they have decided not to do that because someone who aided them 55 years ago doesn't think it is right themselves? No, of course not. Does this mean they don't respect these nations? No again. So I find the hostility against France and the other anti-war countries to be very hypocritical.\n \n The US was doing what they thought to be right, just like the other countries.

Like I said, I never intended that to mean that the French, Brittain, or anyone else owes the US something. I agree, it was a team effort. Again, I say this not to intimate that you owe us something, you don't. It was said to make the point that there is a price to laying in the corner showing your belly like a scared dog. The US almost did that in WWII, we were very reluctant to get involved. But the US realized that the price was not the fear of Germans in Chicago and Nazi flags hanging from our capitol, it was the continued price of human life, and preserving the security and freedom of the world was a fight worth getting involved in. Spain will pay a dear price for their aquiesence to the terrorists. The terrorists now know that if they need something from Spain, they can simply blow up a few more trains or some sort of similar act, and Spain will put it's tail between it's legs and pee on the floor. France is not in much better shape, although with their dealings with Iraq, one wonders who else they have been \"helping\". \n \n The pride I get when I think about my grandfather's death in Bastogne is payment enough. I know that he died serving a cause greater than himself, one that he did not have to be involved in...he choose to be involved in. My grandfather understood the price of freedom, and gladly paid it...even though it was not his freedom he was fighting for. This is a principle that I think the world has forgotten about. It's not always about what threatens us, it is about what we can do for those who are being threatened.",
