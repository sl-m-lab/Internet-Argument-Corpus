   "Subject: What Gender Is It?\n \n \n \n \n You may not know that many non-living things have a gender. \n \n \n For example: \n \n 1) Ziploc bags - Male \n They are male, because they hold everything in, but you can see right through them. \n \n 2) Copiers - Female \n They are female, because once turned off, it takes a while to warm them up again. It's an effective reproductive device if the right buttons are pushed, but can wreak havoc if the wrong buttons are pushed. \n \n 3) Tire - Male \n because it goes bald and it's often over-inflated. \n \n 4) Hot Air Balloon - Male \n because to get it to go anywhere, you have to light a fire under it, and of course, there's the hot air part. \n \n 5) Sponges -- Female \n because they're soft, squeezable, and retain water. \n \n 6) Web Page - Female \n because it's always getting hit on. \n \n 7) Subway - Male \n because it uses the same old lines to pick people up. \n \n 8) Hourglass - Female \n because over time, the weight shifts to the bottom. \n \n 9) Hammer - Male \n because it hasn't changed much over the last 5000 years, but it's handy to have around. \n \n 10) Remote Control -- Female. \n Yeah, you thought it'd be male. But consider this -- it gives a man pleasure, he'd be lost without it, and while he doesn't always know the right buttons to push, he keeps trying.",

   "Those are funny. This is sort of relevant.\n \n \n A Spanish teacher was explaining to her class that in Spanish, unlike English, nouns are designated as either masculine or feminine. 'House' for instance is feminine: 'la casa.' 'Pencil,'however, is masculine: 'el lapiz'. A student asked, \"What gender is 'computer'?\"\n \n Instead of giving the answer, the teacher split the class into two groups, male and female, and asked them to decide for themselves whether \"computer\" should be a masculine or a feminine noun. Each group was asked to give four reasons for its recommendation.\n \n The men's group decided that \"computer\" should definitely be of the feminine gender (\"la computer\"), because:\n \n 1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic.\n \n 2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.\n \n 3. Even the smallest mistakes are stored in long term memory for possible later retrieval; and\n \n 4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it.\n \n The women's group, however, concluded that computers should be masculine (\"el computer\"), because:\n \n 1. In order to do anything with them, you have to turn them on.\n \n 2. They have a lot of data but still can't think for themselves.\n \n 3. They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half The time they ARE the problem; and\n \n 4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that if you had waited a little longer, you could have gotten a better model.\n \n The women won!",
