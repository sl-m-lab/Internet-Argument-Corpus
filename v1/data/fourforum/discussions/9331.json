   "Who speaks for the victims of those we execute?\n \n All over the country, news stories bemoan and hype the countdown to execution number 1,000. But where are the stories regarding the ripple effects of the heinous crimes that these murderers were executed for committing? Who is counting the victims?\n \n A conservative estimate puts the number of victims of these 1,000 murderers at 1,895. Why do we hear so much about the killers and so little about the victims and their loved ones who are left behind to pick up the pieces?\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Melvin and Linda Lorenz and their son Richard were killed by Roger Stafford. Melvin stopped on a highway near Purcell, Okla., to help what he thought was a woman whose car had broken down, but instead was ambushed by Stafford and his brother, using Stafford's wife as bait. Less than a month after these horrific murders, the trio killed six employees of a steak house in Oklahoma City.\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n In 1985, 13-year-old Karen Patterson was shot to death in her bed in North Charleston, S.C. Her killer was a neighbor who had already served 10 years of a life sentence for murdering his half-brother Charles in 1970. Joe Atkins cut the Pattersons' phone lines, then entered bearing a machete, a sawed-off shotgun, and a pistol. Karen's parents were chased out of their home by Atkins. Karen's mom ran to the Atkins home nearby, where Joe then murdered his adopted father, Benjamin Atkins, 75, who had worked to persuade parole authorities to release Joe from the life sentence.",

   "11/27/01 - Oklahoma\n Man found guilty in 12-year-old murder of teen boy - also killed two children as a teenager\n \n In Tulsa, jurors returned a guilty verdict Tuesday night against a man charged with killing and dismembering a teen-ager 12 years ago. Wayne Henry Garrison, 42, has maintained his innocence. His trial began earlier this month. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Jurors will consider Garrison's punishment in a separate hearing. Garrison was charged with 1st-degree murder in the death of Justin Wiles 13, of Tulsa. The boy disappeared June 20, 1989, after he was seen getting into Garrison's car at Garrison's body shop. Parts of Justin's body were found 4 days later at a lake in Wagoner County, according to testimony at a preliminary hearing. Investigators said Justin's head, attached to a rock with wire, was found in Lake Bixhoma. Garrison was charged and arrested in the case on Oct. 22, 1999 -- more than a decade after 1st being identified as a suspect. As a teen-ager, Garrison killed two children in Tulsa. Police earlier said the circumstances of those killings were similar to Justin's death. Justin was reported missing in June 1989 when he didn't come home from mowing lawns. Police said a friend of Garrison's reported seeing Justin get into a car with Garrison on June 20, 1989. Police said that was the last time the teen was seen alive.\n \n 9/21/01 - Alabama\n Holman inmate convicted of capital murder\n \n A Holman Correctional Facility inmate was found guilty of capital murder Friday in the stabbing death of another inmate. An Escambia County jury deliberated for less than an hour before finding Cuhuatemoc Little Warrior Peraita, 25, guilty in the 1999 prison stabbing death of inmate Quincy Lewis. Peraita waived his right to have jurors recommend to the judge if he should be sentenced to life in prison without parole or to death. Peraita instructed his attorneys not to fight prosecution efforts to seek the death penalty. Circuit Judge Bradley Byrne said he would schedule sentencing at a later date. It was not the 1st capital murder trial for Peraita. When Lewis was stabbed, Peraita was serving a life without parole sentence for killing three of his former co-workers during a 1994 robbery at a fast food restaurant in Gadsden.",
