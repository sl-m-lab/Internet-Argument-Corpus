In what way, if any, does their speech and actions differ from those not so blessed?

For the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.\n 1Cr 3:18 \n Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise.\n 1Cr 3:19 \n For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, \"He catches the wise in their own craftiness\";[fn1]\n 1Cr 3:20 \n and again, \"The LORD knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.\"[fn2]\n 1Cr 3:21 \n Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours:\n \n 1Cr 6:17 \n But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him.\n 1Cr 6:18 \n Flee sexual immorality. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.\n 1Cr 6:19 \n Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?\n 1Cr 6:20 \n For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.\n \n Jhn 3:5 \n Jesus answered, \"Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.\n Jhn 3:6 \n \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.\n Jhn 3:7 \n \"Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'\n Jhn 3:8 \n \"The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.\"",

   "The Pentecostals and many Charistmatics take the 'speaking in gibberish/ tongues' to be the (1st) manifestation of the Holy Spirit.\n However, most who follow that belief often have a 'fake it until you make it' attitude.\n They base this belief off of the noted instances in the bible (such as in Acts) when people recieved the H.S., they often (4/5 times IIRC) also spoke in tongues...of course, in some instances they also phophesised...but that's harder to fake...so we'll just babble and call it tongues...even if the early Pentecostal founders thought that doing so was speaking an actual foreign language...\n \n Jo's list sounds semi-accurate...but distressing as no one possesses those attributes.\n \n A generic push is bearing 'fruit of the faith' (ie good deeds) as the only sign of ones Christianity...but, many non-believers also exhibit that...\n \n Gal 5:22-26\n But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires. Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.\n \n Heb 2:4\n God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.\n \n This here would state that there are many gifts of th Spirit (Jo's miracles as outlined in 1Corinthians 12-13ish) but, that's Spiritual Gifts given as the H.S. desires, not necessarily a sign of possessing the indwelling nature of the H.S. (the thing Archie often brags about).\n \n \n Personally, I'd go with those who possess the indwelling thingy as manifesting the list from Gal. 5:22. A calm disposition and inner conviction coupled with a compelling desire to assist your fellow man and a long suffering nature ready to easily give love, forgiveness and mercy in a compassionate manner to all and with a desire to protect the weak and less fortunate from the depradations of others.\n These individuals could also possess charismatic gifts given according to the H.S. desires so as to help assist them in these efforts as well as assisting in evangelism. \n That would be the 'miraculous' gifts of healing, speaking and interpreting a language for the spreading of the faith, prophesy for the edification of the Church (believers in Christ), and possibly more such as ministry.\n \n \n \n Hope that helped some.\n My personal experience with most who claim the indwelling is with those who seem to self-lable. Possessing nothing to differentiate themselves from a heathen sinner in prison for multiple felonies. \n Just a bragging of possessing something intangible that makes them right...and their opponents wrong.",

As always, simply pasting Bible quotes, even in BIG RED LETTERS, doesn't actually count as communication. If you want to say something, you should really consider saying it in your own words.

   "I don't know what to make of their claims, I can't speak to the contents of other men's hearts. I suppose the best I can come up with is that we all, to a greater or lesser extent experience the Spirit at work within us, and one measure of our progress in faith might be the extent to which we embrace the work of the Spirit, so to be filled with the Holy Spirit means to take successfully manage what is prayed for in the words of the song: \"let my life be yours and yet, let it still be me\". So, when we are baptised or confirmed, depending on your understanding, we receive the Holy Spirit, but whether we could be said to be filled with it would rather depend on whether we have been successful in following Christ's commands.",
