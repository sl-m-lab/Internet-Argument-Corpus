If nuclear stations are built it will be because governments make a decision that they are the way to go. Additionally there is the issue of planning regulations, given the NIMBYism impeding the construction of wind farms, the chances of nuclear power stations getting planning consent without massive government sponsorship (given the very real track record of accidents in the nuclear industry, Windscale anyone?) is slim to none.\n \n I take the threat of global warming seriously, but I also recognise that nuclear is at best a stop gap and at worst a dangerous red herring in the pursuit of safe, renewable energy. Once wave and tidal power is sorted, the only argument for nuclear will be dead in the water.",
