   "The Ugly Racial History of Gun Control | Richmond Times-Dispatch\n \n \nIn his concurring statement in 'McDonald v. Chicago' -- the Supreme Court case affirming that the Second Amendment ensures an individual right to own firearms -- Justice Clarence Thomas discussed the history of gun-control laws, whose purpose was to stifle the rights of minorities and to prevent African-Americans from defending themselves against the likes of the Ku Klux Klan. Excerpts from Thomas' opinion appear below.\n \n In the contentious years leading up to the Civil War, those who sought to retain the institution of slavery found that to do so, it was necessary to eliminate more and more of the basic liberties of slaves, free blacks, and white abolitionists. Congressman Tobias Plants explained that slaveholders \"could not hold [slaves] safely where dissent was permitted,\" so they decided that \"all dissent must be suppressed by the strong hand of power.\"\n \n The measures they used were ruthless, repressed virtually every right recognized in the Constitution, and demonstrated that preventing only discriminatory state firearms restrictions would have been a hollow assurance for liberty. Public reaction indicates that the American people understood this point. The overarching goal of pro-slavery forces was to repress the spread of abolitionist thought and the concomitant risk of a slave rebellion.\n \n \n \n Indeed, it is difficult to overstate the extent to which fear of a slave uprising gripped slaveholders and dictated the acts of Southern legislatures. Slaves and free blacks represented a substantial percentage of the population and posed a severe threat to Southern order if they were not kept in their place. According to the 1860 Census, slaves represented one quarter or more of the population in 11 of the 15 slave States, nearly half the population in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Louisiana, and more than 50 percent of the population in Mississippi and South Carolina.\n \n . . .\n \n The Southern fear of slave rebellion was not unfounded. Although there were others, two particularly notable slave uprisings heavily influenced slaveholders in the South. In 1822, a group of free blacks and slaves led by Denmark Vesey planned a rebellion in which they would slay their masters and flee to Haiti. The plan was foiled, leading to the swift arrest of 130 blacks, and the execution of 37, including Vesey.\n \n Still, slaveowners took notice -- it was reportedly feared that as many as 6,600 to 9,000 slaves and free blacks were involved in the plot. A few years later, the fear of rebellion was realized. An uprising led by Nat Turner took the lives of at least 57 whites before it was suppressed.\n \n The fear generated by these and other rebellions led Southern legislatures to take particularly vicious aim at the rights of free blacks and slaves to speak or to keep and bear arms for their defense. Teaching slaves to read (even the Bible) was a criminal offense punished severely in some States. Virginia made it a crime for a member of an \"abolition\" society to enter the State and argue \"that the owners of slaves have no property in the same, or advocate or advise the abolition of slavery.\"\n \n Other States prohibited the circulation of literature denying a master's right to property in his slaves and passed laws requiring postmasters to inspect the mails in search of such material. Many legislatures amended their laws prohibiting slaves from carrying firearms to apply the prohibition to free blacks as well.\n \n Florida made it the \"duty\" of white citizen \"patrol[s] to search negro houses or other suspected places, for firearms.\" If they found any firearms, the patrols were to take the offending slave or free black \"to the nearest justice of the peace,\" whereupon he would be \"severely punished\" by \"whipping on the bare back, not exceeding 39 lashes,\" unless he could give a \"plain and satisfactory\" explanation of how he came to possess the gun.\n \n . . .\n \n Southern blacks were not alone in facing threats to their personal liberty and security during the antebellum era. Mob violence in many Northern cities presented dangers as well . . .\n \n After the Civil War, Southern anxiety about an uprising among the newly freed slaves peaked. As Representative Thaddeus Stevens is reported to have said, \"[W]hen it was first proposed to free the slaves, and arm the blacks, did not half the nation tremble? The prim conservatives, the snobs, and the male waiting-maids in Congress, were in hysterics.\"\n \n As the Court explains, this fear led to \"systematic efforts\" in the \"old Confederacy\" to disarm the more than 180,000 freedmen who had served in the Union Army, as well as other free blacks. Some States formally prohibited blacks from possessing firearms. Others enacted legislation prohibiting blacks from carrying firearms without a license, a restriction not imposed on whites. Additionally, \"[T]hroughout the South, armed parties, often consisting of ex-Confederate soldiers serving in the state militias, forcibly took firearms from newly freed slaves.\"\n \n As the Court makes crystal clear, if the Fourteenth Amendment \"had outlawed only those laws that discriminate on the basis of race or previous condition of servitude, African-Americans in the South would likely have remained vulnerable to attack by many of their worst abusers: the state militia and state peace officers.\"\n \n In the years following the Civil War, a law banning firearm possession outright \"would have been nondiscriminatory only in the formal sense,\" for it would have \"left firearms in the hands of the militia and local peace officers.\"\n \n Evidence suggests that the public understood this at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. The publicly circulated Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction extensively detailed these abuses, and statements by citizens indicate that they looked to the Committee to provide a federal solution to this problem.\n \n . . .\n \n One way in which the Federal Government responded was to issue military orders countermanding Southern arms legislation . . . .The significance of these steps was not lost on those they were designed to protect. After one such order was issued, The Christian Recorder, published by the African Methodist Episcopal Church, published the following editorial:\n \n \"We have several times alluded to the fact that the Constitution of the United States, guaranties to every citizen the right to keep and bear arms . . . .All men, without the distinction of color, have the right to keep arms to defend their homes, families, or themselves.\n \n \"We are glad to learn that [the] Commissioner for this State . . . has given freedmen to understand that they have as good a right to keep fire arms as any other citizens. The Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the land, and we will be governed by that at present.\"\n \n The same month, The Loyal Georgian carried a letter to the editor asking \"Have colored persons a right to own and carry fire arms? -- A Colored Citizen.\" The editors responded as follows:\n \n \"Almost every day, we are asked questions similar to the above. We answer certainly you have the same right to own and carry fire arms that other citizens have. You are not only free but citizens of the United States and, as such, entitled to the same privileges granted to other citizens by the Constitution of the United States . . . .\"\n \n These statements are consistent with the arguments of abolitionists during the antebellum era that slavery, and the slave States' efforts to retain it, violated the constitutional rights of individuals -- rights the abolitionists described as among the privileges and immunities of citizenship. The problem abolitionists sought to remedy was that, under Dred Scott, blacks were not entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens under the Federal Constitution and that, in many States, whatever inalienable rights state law recognized did not apply to blacks . . . .\n \n Cruikshank's holding that blacks could look only to state governments for protection of their right to keep and bear arms enabled private forces, often with the assistance of local governments, to subjugate the newly freed slaves and their descendants through a wave of private violence designed to drive blacks from the voting booth and force them into peonage, an effective return to slavery. Without federal enforcement of the inalienable right to keep and bear arms, these militias and mobs were tragically successful in waging a campaign of terror against the very people the Fourteenth Amendment had just made citizens.\n \n Take, for example, the Hamburg Massacre of 1876.There, a white citizen militia sought out and murdered a troop of black militiamen for no other reason than that they had dared to conduct a celebratory Fourth of July parade through their mostly black town. The white militia commander, \"Pitchfork\" Ben Tillman, later described this massacre with pride: \"[T]he leading white men of Edgefield\" had decided \"to seize the first opportunity that the negroes might offer them to provoke a riot and teach the negroes a lesson by having the whites demonstrate their superiority by killing as many of them as was justifiable.\"\n \n . . .\n \n Organized terrorism like that perpetuated by Tillman and his cohorts proliferated in the absence of federal enforcement of constitutional rights. Militias such as the Ku Klux Klan, the Knights of the White Camellia, the White Brotherhood, the Pale Faces, and the '76 Association spread terror among blacks and white Republicans by breaking up Republican meetings, threatening political leaders, and whipping black militiamen. These groups raped, murdered, lynched, and robbed as a means of intimidating, and instilling pervasive fear in, those whom they despised.\n \n Although Congress enacted legislation to suppress these activities, Klan tactics remained a constant presence in the lives of Southern blacks for decades. Between 1882 and 1968, there were at least 3,446 reported lynchings of blacks in the South. They were tortured and killed for a wide array of alleged crimes, without even the slightest hint of due process. Emmit Till, for example, was killed in 1955 for allegedly whistling at a white woman. The fates of other targets of mob violence were equally depraved.\n \n The use of firearms for self-defense was often the only way black citizens could protect themselves from mob violence. As Eli Cooper, one target of such violence, is said to have explained, \"[T]he Negro has been run over for fifty years, but it must stop now, and pistols and shotguns are the only weapons to stop a mob.\"\n \n Sometimes, as in Cooper's case, self defense did not succeed. He was dragged from his home by a mob and killed as his wife looked on. But at other times, the use of firearms allowed targets of mob violence to survive. One man recalled the night during his childhood when his father stood armed at a jail until morning to ward off lynchers. The experience left him with a sense, \"not of powerlessness,\" but of the \"possibilities of salvation\" that came from standing up to intimidation\n \n In my view, the record makes plain that the Framers of the Privileges or Immunities Clause and the ratifying-era public understood --just as the Framers of the Second Amendment did -- that the right to keep and bear arms was essential to the preservation of liberty. The record makes equally plain that they deemed this right necessary to include in the minimum baseline of federal rights that the Privileges or Immunities Clause established in the wake of the War over slavery.\n",

   "Some examples of early gun laws that don't seem to be racist:\n \n \n- Colonial governments expressed particular concern over the firing of guns after dark, in part because the traditional method of raising the alarm of an attack after dark involved the firing of several guns in succession. Thus, an amendment to New Hampshire's militia law prohibited the firing of guns after sunset during \"time of war or watch.\" Connecticut and Georgia enacted similar measures.\n \n - By 1770, the shooting of guns was prohibited in the cities of Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. The colonies of Pennsylvania and New York extended this prohibition to all other towns and boroughs. Delaware also prohibited the firing of guns within built-up areas, but made an exception for \"days of public rejoicing.\"\n \n - Rhode Island banned the placement of shooting ranges lying across a public highway. Pennsylvania banned gunfire \"on or near any of the King's highways.\" The legislature noted, however, that the fine did not extend \"to any person carrying a gun on the public highway.\" New Jersey also explicitly protected the carrying of guns on the highways.\n \n - Massachusetts regulated the manner of keeping arms as well as the manner of using them. As a precaution against the accidental wounding of firefighters, the state prohibited the storage of loaded guns in any house within the town of Boston. At least some of these laws, including the prohibition of storing loaded guns in Boston, provided for the confiscation of the gun as penalty. North Carolina and New Jersey both acted to prevent trespasses by hunters and to preserve their game populations by levying steep fines for abusive hunting practices. Each colony also provided that hunters without a \"settled habitation\" or residence in the colony would forfeit their guns.\n\n Robert H.

They're not even remotely the same as the honest people who feel that the government is a true threat to the well being of the country and the people of the nation.\n \n Are you honestly going to try and argue that the people have no right to be outraged over such incidents as the post-Katrina mess where National Guard members threatened to outright murder the hurricane survivors if they didn't turn over their arms and make ready for mandatory evacuation of the city, without their supplies, pets, or loved ones?\n \n You made the argument that the Second Amendment was designed to be a tool for the American people to resist the federal government. If you still stand by this argument that you yourself made, then these militia groups that are standing in opposition of the federal government are wholly constitutional in nature, and those that oppose them are anti-constitutionalists.\n\n You still don't understand how the RKBA was intended to function as a protection against tyranny. Early Americans inherited from their English ancestors a fear of standing armies. The king of England had used a standing army to oppress the people. Many early Americans were afraid of what might happen if the federal government of their new nation had a large, powerful standing army. They felt much safer entrusting the security of their new nation to a well regulated militia. They wanted a well regulated militia to be the main military force of the nation. Citizens were typically expected to register with their local, state appointed militia officer upon turning 18. Congress had the power to determine the type of training the militia would receive and call upon the militia to defend the nation as they did in the War of 1812. Allowing people to form their own private militias and stockpile all sorts of military weapons is a recipe for lawlessness, anarchy, and arguable worse than the threat posed to liberty by a standing army. Just look at nations in the Middle East where many individuals have formed their own militias with access to a lot of military weaponry. You certainly wouldn't want groups like this group is Arizona to have access to the kind of weaponry that the Taliban has-\n YouTube - Arizona: They're Not All Bigots Just 50%\n \n Anarchy can be just as great a threat to liberty as too much government. John Adams said,\n \n \"To suppose arms in the hands of citizens, to be used at individual discretion, except in private self-defense, or by partial orders of towns, countries or districts of a state, is to demolish every constitution, and lay the laws prostrate, so that liberty can be enjoyed by no man; it is a dissolution of the government. The fundamental law of the militia is, that it be created, directed and commanded by the laws, and ever for the support of the laws.\"\n \n What would have happened if the Founders could have seen into the future and seen all the mayhem associated with firearms in the present day and the lack of common sense of many people?

Justify your previous excuse of a claim! Actually prove something! Stop contradicting yourself! Do I have to show you your previous claim about the Second Amendment and beat you over the head with it to refresh your memory?\n \n Give us an answer already!\n\n I think this question has already been asked and answered. Consider the words of Alexander Hamilton:\n \"If a well-regulated militia be the most natural defense of a free country, it ought certainly to be under the regulation and at the disposal of that body which is constituted the guardian of the national security. If standing armies are dangerous to liberty, an efficacious power over the militia in the same body ought, as far as possible, to take away the inducement and the pretext to such unfriendly institutions. If the federal government can command the aid of the militia in those emergencies which call for the military arm in support of the civil magistrate, it can the better dispense with the employment of a different kind of force. If it cannot avail itself of the former, it will be obliged to recur to the latter. To render an army unnecessary will be a more certain method of preventing its existence than a thousand prohibitions upon paper.&#8221;\n \n Many of the Founders thought that a standing army posed a serious threat to liberty and Hamilton recognizes that a well regulated militia would make such a threat to liberty unnecessary. Thus, a standing army would not be a necessary evil that must be tolerated because a well regulated militia could take its place. Along these same lines, Elbridge Gerry said:\n \n \"What, sir, is the use of a militia? It is to prevent the establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty.\"\n \n \n \n\n And what exactly kept the federal government from simply usurping control from the states through the supremacy clause?\n \n Or better yet your new favorite, the commerce clause? Do you have a fancy doublespeak answer for that?\n \n And yet you claim congress and the federal government became the commander and chief over the militia through Article 1 of the Constitution, meaning they had full authority. How do you have a check on government power when they're holding all the cards and have nobody to answer to?\n\n The Constitution explicitly grants certain powers to the states over the militia. The Supremacy Clause can't change this. The President is only the Commander in Chief of the militia when it is called into the service of the United States such as in a time of war. \n \n \n\n Nope, not gonna fly. I already explained that such groups don't count since their position is the cold blooded murder of innocent people for absolutely no reason. Telling the government where to get off isn't the same thing. Your comparison not only fails, it's highly insulting to anyone that believes the government doesn't have the authority to carry out their kangaroo court shenanigans.\n\n You started this thread by claiming that gun control is racist and now you're defending racists? \n \n \n\n Who says we aren't. The government shouldn't be exempt from the rules they expect us to follow without question.\n \n Nope. Once again your argument fails. By that logic Alaska should be the deadliest state in the entire nation, because there's almost no gun control at all up there.\n \n Now you have two obligations to fulfill. Explain how exactly how private militia groups, made up of private citizens will lead to pure anarchy in this country. And show us exactly how government control over firearms is supposed to prevent anarchy.\n\n And what kinds of deadly military weapons do private militia groups have in Alaska? Stop making straw man arguments. I never predicted that private militia groups would lead to pure anarchy in the US especially when most people in such groups are probably full of hot air and have nothing more powerful than semi-automatic weapons. Private militia groups are like the teabaggers- their ideology is not sound and attempts to confuse the difference between legitimate government and tyranny.\n \n \n\n Answer the damn question already. Quit evading, quit running, quit changing the subject. Explain how not tolerating the federal government's shenanigans is the exact same as wanting absolutely all laws to be abolished.\n \n Pure strawman. It's already been established, to a point beyond any reasonable doubt, that the Second Amendment had absolutely nothing to do with the government run militia, which is already covered in Article 1 of the Constitution. Why is that simple fact so damn hard for you to understand? Are you intentionally ignoring all relevant facts because you don't feel like paying attention? \n \n You're going to tell this bold faced lie, after claiming that private militia groups are unconstitutional in nature, despite all the evidence to the contrary?\n\n Looking back through the posts, I don't see where it was claimed that such groups absolutely want \"all laws to be abolished.\" You have not introduced one iota of evidence to show that the militia protected in the Second Amendment is a private, non-governmental militia. So what are these \"relevant facts\" you claim are being ignored? Let's go back to the issue you keep conveniently dodging: Why did the Founders debate about whether conscientious objectors should be exempted from service in the militia if the militia referred to in the Second Amendment is a private militia that couldn't compel people to serve in the first place? Supreme Court precedent also exposes the fallacy of your claims:\n \n \"Military organization and military drill and parade under arms are subjects especially under the control of the government of every country. They cannot be claimed as a right independent of law. Under our political system they are subject to the regulation and control of the State and Federal governments, acting in due regard to their respective prerogatives and powers.\"\n (Presser v.

Now either answer the question, in your own words, or surrender the argument once and for all.\n \n Your highly contradictory argument is akin to saying that pest management can only be carried out if the pest animal isn't put in a position where it might be harmed or killed\n \n \nMany of the Founders thought that a standing army posed a serious threat to liberty and Hamilton recognizes that a well regulated militia would make such a threat to liberty unnecessary. Thus, a standing army would not be a necessary evil that must be tolerated because a well regulated militia could take its place. Along these same lines, Elbridge Gerry said:\n \n \"What, sir, is the use of a militia? It is to prevent the establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty.\"\n\n \n Hamilton and many others talk about a standing army. Yet they make no mention of a tyrannical government, just like that of King George back in Britain. They can't help you on this, it's up to you to answer the question. Now answer it!\n \n \nThe Constitution explicitly grants certain powers to the states over the militia. The Supremacy Clause can't change this. The President is only the Commander in Chief of the militia when it is called into the service of the United States such as in a time of war.\n\n \n And if the states should feel the federal government has become tyrannical and muster their militia forces to overthrow it, that would be considered a time of war, in which the president would have authority over the forces sent to overthrow the tyrants.\n \n Your circular logic fails. Try again.\n \n \nYou started this thread by claiming that gun control is racist and now you're defending racists?\n\n \n I'm doing no such thing. I'm taking offense over your comparison of honest Americans with the scum of the planet. You sit there and blather on and on about how private militia groups are racists and extremists who just want everybody dead no matter what, but when you're challenged about your stupidity to try and make it out like those that refuse to agree with your hair brained schemes are in support of racist notions.\n \n Either prove that distrust of the government by honest citizens is the same as support racist ideals, or shut up.\n \n \nAnd what kinds of deadly military weapons do private militia groups have in Alaska? Stop making straw man arguments.\n\n \n You said a lack of government control of arms, any arms, is what leads to anarchy. You even used the Congo as an example. I pointed to a state with very few gun control laws to show your comparison fails, and now you're changing the argument to only military weapons? Not gonna work. You're not going to get away with your goalpost moving.\n \n \nI never predicted that private militia groups would lead to pure anarchy in the US\n\n \n Yes you did. Reread your previous posts.\n \n \nespecially when most people in such groups are probably full of hot air\n\n \n So you mentioning McVeigh was just a slip of the tongue?\n \n \nand have nothing more powerful than semi-automatic weapons.\n\n \n Nothing more powerful than semi-automatic weapons? Your statement suggests that such weapons pose hardly any threat at all. And yet in previous threads you've talked about the dangerous of semi-automatic firearms and spoken on why the \"assault weapons ban\" should be reinstated. You're contradicting yourself again.\n \n \nPrivate militia groups are like the teabaggers- their ideology is not sound and attempts to confuse the difference between legitimate government and tyranny.\n\n \n You're the one that's confused. Not those of us that are members of private militia groups. Because unlike you, others are actually capable of learning from the history of other countries and we know how things can go wrong, what can go wrong, and what allowed it to happen. Simply because your own ignorance leaves you eternally blind to the real world is no reason to assume that others know nothing.\n \n \nLooking back through the posts, I don't see where it was claimed that such groups absolutely want \"all laws to be abolished.\"\n\n \n And what the f**k do you think anarchy is? Anarchy is a state of new laws, no rules, none. You claimed private militia groups would lead to anarchy, meaning you claimed they would lead to a state of being without any laws or rules of any sort.\n \n Engage your brain to think before you open your mouth to speak.\n \n \nYou have not introduced one iota of evidence to show that the militia protected in the Second Amendment is a private, non-governmental militia.\n\n \n I'll do that when you can show that the only militia protected by the Second Amendment is the government run, government controlled militia that operates as the right hand of the dictators, trained to murder anyone and everyone without exception or question.\n \n According to your arguments the only legal militia in the country is the military, the current standing army.\n \n \n\"Military organization and military drill and parade under arms are subjects especially under the control of the government of every country. They cannot be claimed as a right independent of law. Under our political system they are subject to the regulation and control of the State and Federal governments, acting in due regard to their respective prerogatives and powers.\"\n (Presser v. Illinois)\n\n \n If these private militia groups really are illegal, then why are the authorities doing absolutely nothing in response? Why aren't they carrying out Waco style raids, rounding up everybody at gun point, and having them prosecuted in the courts? We know where they are, where they're operating, how they're operating, etc. And yet none of these groups are facing criminal charges. None of them are even being shut down. So either the government doesn't care about these private militia groups and considers them no threat at all, or no laws are being broken.\n \n A while back you kept arguing and arguing that those of us who support the Second Amendment should be pushing back for the true and original meaning; that being our ability to organize and drill in military standards, IE the militia. But when we've got groups doing just that, doing just as you said they should be doing, you make an abrupt heel face turn, and claim that what they're doing is unconstitutional in nature.\n \n The contradictions with you never stop. You say one thing, then you say another completely different thing, and then later you go back and say that you never claimed either. And then you make an entirely different argument to support a previous statement despite the fact that you renounced said previous statement.",

Especially since one of your arguments is that the Second Amendment only protects arms suitable for militia duties, which would be all semi-automatic firearms in existence!\n \n Then you have no reason to call them dangerous, and no reason to call them unconstitutional. You've just forfeited the argument with this statement of yours.\n \n They're the same thing when the person in charge has the authority to pass a law making them the same thing.\n\n If they're the same thing then why did the Founders bother to distinguish between the army and the militia in the Constitution? \n \n \nThese people are pushing for their right to drill and assemble. You're claiming that what they're doing is illegal. You said that if we truly supported the true meaning of the Second Amendment then we'd be pushing for our right to drill and assemble as a militia. You're contradictions cripple you and lose your entire argument.\n\n Now you're trying to making it seem as if I was talking about participating in private militia groups. However when I posted before about this you clearly recognized that I was talking about the constitutional militia of Article 1. You responded-\n \n \nCongress choosing to eliminate our militia status with one stroke of the pen was the best thing that could happen for us. By disowning us the government has given up any and all power to regulate us. The government no longer has the power to call the militia into service, or to disband them. That means should the government push too far and its time to fight back, we'll have no duty to lay down our arms and kneel a tyrant master with blind obedience.\n\n \n \nSuggesting that the Second Amendment protects a right to serve only in a government-sanctioned militia, is like claiming the First Amendment protects a right to free speech only if you're spreading a government approved message and nothing else.And you conveniently forget the part about how these groups haven't been shut down, meaning that they're not doing anything illegal. You don't operate publicly for over ten years if you're breaking the law, it just doesn't happen.\n\n You can speculate endlessly, but that's not evidence. And it seems you've dodged a lot of evidence that contradicts your position such as this Supreme Court ruling:\n \n \"Military organization and military drill and parade under arms are subjects especially under the control of the government of every country. They cannot be claimed as a right independent of law. Under our political system they are subject to the regulation and control of the State and Federal governments, acting in due regard to their respective prerogatives and powers.\"\n (Presser v.
