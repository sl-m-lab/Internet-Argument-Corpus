   "Google must be comfortable with the censorship arrangement it has with Communist China. My attempt to expose those in the world whose motives are less than honorable was censored by Google on or about April 12, 2006.\n \n The first clue appeared when a popular article I had posted on another site, a pro-Bush forum with over 400 viewings, was deleted from the forum without comment. There has been no response to my three emails asking for an explanation.The title of the post: Mexican Invasion: Crunch Time Is Here. \n \n Then I noticed a sharp downturn in visits to my websites. I went to Google and checked out some titles. Five had disappeared. These articles were ranked either number 1 or near the top for, in some cases, at least eight months. An example: Muhammad And Women, ranked 9 out of 15,000,000 sites, 2/24/06. It vanished weeks after I sent an email to the most well-known Muslim in America explaining why I disagreed with his mellow view of Islam.\n \n I emailed MichNews.com about the problem and received this response: \n \"...MichNews.com was just removed recently from Google News. They received complaints regarding two articles involving muslims and islam. Google News considered the articles to be \"hate content\". So they decided to remove MichNews.com as a news source for good. ...It's getting scary out there!\"\n \n Note that there are harsh articles on the same subjects listed on the same pages as mine that were left untouched. Also, some of my deleted or hidden titles remain listed on the same pages as the ones which were removed. The difference is they are on other websites and my name isn't visible. Those responsible were clearly after me.\n \n I am listing the offending articles below. My unique view on these topics seem to be a cause for concern to certain people. See if you can figure out who the offended parties are:\n \n Bush Delivers Coup De Grace To America\n \n Bush Agrees To Open Borders [ 3 out of 8,840,000, 4/6/06]\n \n Globalism: A Bleak Future For American Workers [1 out of 259,000, 4/6/06]\n \n Muhammad And Women\n \n George Bush: A case For Impeachment [41 out of 4,120,000, 4/6/06] The facts are presented and the dots connected. Someone with the ability to affect who gets heard and who gets silenced definitely has a problem with the message I bring.\n \n The internet is the last outpost for free speech but a change is in progress. The New World Order will bring with it a joyless world for those not in the ruling class.\n \n It is getting scary out there. \n \n As of 4/16/06, these articles can still be accessed at http://home.cfl.rr.com/raykania",
