This thread, \"Are Africa Americans blaming Whites for all the racial problems in America?\" is the height of hypocrisy. You are fingerpointing at the African American \"race\", saying \"your race blames white Americans for racism\".\n \n Some of what you say is valid, and there are indeed individuals who attempt to justify things on the grounds of their race, or on some supposed collectivist moral debt. There's no point discussing this though, if you're going to do the exact same thing the people you are complaining about do.\n \n \nIt seems that the black community sees the white as owing them something\n\n \n This is the problem with collectivist thinking.

   "I think blacks are confronted with two main influences that have a bad impact-- one is not under their control, the other is.\n \n Simply put, we should have given blacks their 40 acres and a mule after the Civil War, but we didn't. And so, an economic burden became a devastating one as blacks were forced to become sharecroppers. Blacks were unable to produce much of an income, which allowed for little tax returns that failed to allow for even average schools and teachers. Government intervention under Johnson and Grant had little positive influence. Consequently, literacy rates were ridiculously low for a long time.\n \n The next issue is responsibility. Blacks simply are spending too much time blaming the status quo on others, sure they can, but instead of providing an excuse for themselves, they should hit the books and rise through society.

Therefore they performed less labor and often received more attention than Pure or black-Africans. Thus, those light-skinned blacks had developed a ideology of dislike for umixed blacks because they had mixed blood in their veins and \"white\" was popular. Although those lighter blacks could only use \"colored\" accommodations and they were not distinguish from the rest, they needed someone to feel superior to in order to approve their self esteem. Some blacks would most likely be jealous of lighter blacks due to historical events. I once remember a friend of mine from the carribbean described her childhood to me. She stated that Her family members treated her differently from her other young counsins because her skin was darker than theirs. I don't have a problem with young teenagers who speak ebonics(slang) because alot of teenagers speak slang with their friends. However, slang should not be allowed in classrooms.",

   "The majority of blacks that I have encountered, not only blame all whites, but they are also very racist against whites. Mind you, not ALL blacks have been this way. I sit there and listen to them put white people down all the time. \n This brings me one of my points. I feel that no matter what race it is, there are always going to be selfish people. I think that many of the blacks that are judging other races are one of two ways. They are hiding behind their race and using it as an excuse. Or, they are too ignorant to see past the color and realise that EVERYONE has problems. \n They don't slavery was fair? Neither do I. I also don't think it's fair that my Mother has cancer. For that matter, I don't think it's fair for anyone to have cancer.\n It isn't just about them, it's about everyone. Everyone has hardships, problems and heartache. \n For other races that blame me for their problems listen up. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH OR WHAT I HAVE FACED! I AGREE BAD THINGS HAPPEN. BUT, YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY PEOPLE IT HAPPENES TO. SO, STOP BLAMING OTHERS EXCEPT FOR THE ACTUAL PEOPLE THAT DID UNFAIR ACTS TO YOU!!! I CAN'T BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S ACTIONS.

   "Hey everyone,\n \n This is the umpteenth time I have randomly ran into a forum including this, and I finally have to say something, because this is starting to disturb me. I am black, grown up around black family, in a black neighborhood, where I had/have black friends. And though I may be willing to admit this could be some sort of areal glitch, I've never participated or overheard anybody, nor myself, actively blame white people for their specific problems in life. It just doesn't occur. I am very interested in hearing concrete evidence for this happening.\n \n But conversely I have been approached, and accused by some white people (both on in the internet and in real life) about blacks complaining and doing nothing for themselves. I'm worried about the online people that do this as the ones that I knew personally I was the only black person that they hung out with on any sort of regular basis, and I question the validity of their argument. A couple of other things that makes me suspicious of some accusers of not having too much first hand contact with the black community is:\n \n The 'N-word' is contested within the black community. Some don't want that word used at all, period, and find it offensive at all times. *Including* when other black people say it. I'm surprised this isn't taken in consideration.\n \n Around the peope I know Jessie Jackson and Al Sharpton are considered a bit crazy, and a bad representation of our community. Though that's just us; I'm not going to speak for everyone.\n \n That light/dark prejudice is becoming highy irregular. For every person that may have that tendency I know others that does not care.\n \n The average black person I know is very skittish about the race issue, and rather injure themselves than come to any question/problems w/ a race issue to a white person, fearing their response. I would like to say this is completely unfounded, but I have run into a hostile case, though this was only once. But that was in real life; the internet is much more hostile, and I don't know what to make of that.\n \n Note that again all of this is what I'm seeing, but this is all first hand knowledge.\n \n I'm not going to put myself against anyone who posted in here, but I don't like the generalizations of our opinions, thoughts, and work ethic; they are widely varied. And I would feel a whole lot better if you people have had indepth relationships with black people and not run-in incidents to support your claims, so please tell me this is the case.",

I can't say I've ever heard a black person blame white people for anything.

IMO, white people complaining about \"reverse racism\" (which doesn't even make sense as racism isn't specific to any group against any other group) is just another excuse for them to justify their own racism in the first place. emoticon_angry",

   "First let me start by saying this is a very sensitive issue. In no way am I degrading the black community in any way by the suggestions I make. Many blacks are the very soul of this nation and I praise their patriatism. To begin I ask why does it seem that racial tensions are increasing in this nation? It seems to me that Mr. Jesse Jackson is always of the front lines as the defender against civil racism. Yet I see the man as being one who is an observist and not really an activist. That he uses cases for his own publicity rather than being one for the issue. It seems that the black community sees the white as owing them something for all the hardships we put them through during their times of slavery and segregation. My assumption was confirmed when in my Mathmatics class I discussed this issue with a black student who viewed whites as inferior. He looked down upon me as \"a supid white boy.\" I felt that I was being discriminated against and was pressured by his dare I say it, racial discrimination. Also why does it seem that they think they have more freedoms than we? Why in their own inner circles do they say the \"N\" word without offence, and then they say we're \"racist\" for using the SAME word as they? Does this feel lopsided to you? No, because we owe them something for our ancestors mistakes in the PAST. We must stop the fingerpointing for saying well your race did this or your kind did that. Did not Mr. King himself say he wished for brotherhood, not animosity? Too many times do I see we forget the enlightend views of this great man. We must look not only at our past, but to the future and hope that we can come together for not only each other but for the common good of humanity as well.\n\n \n Jason I can appreciate what you have stated without taking offense. Racism is a sensitive issue to discuss. The blame doesn't fall upon any individual person. Rather, the problem is that the XIII Amendment was purposed to abolish slavery. Yet, it legalized slavery to police our communities. \n \n The executive branch has farmed out the enforcement of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to the bar association of lawyers. District attorneys capitalize on State laws to terrorize minority groups to hire private lawyers for protection.\n \n The latter has germinated fear, hatred and animosity among African Americans towards the White community. The only way to correct the problem is to remove slavery from the U.S. Constitution.",

   "Sorry for bumping this topic; themes like this eventually drain a lot out of me, but I want to say one more thing:\n \n If you think black people are actively blaming their well deserved problems on the White race then I would like to suggest that instead of venting on random forums that you actively try to gain understanding from as many black people that you know well, if you can, and come to your own conclusions. I think the problem on both sides is lack of communication and understanding. Do black people do it really? If so why? Because I keep hearing indirect and completely direct accusations of lazinesss and stupidity (among other things) for it, and if you think that I fear that you are not looking hard enough into the issue. \n \n Of course this goes both ways (or more correctly, all ways, for all the race/ethnic groups). I have seen really sucky, closeminded, really craptacular attitudes from both sides, and to continuously blame one for all misunderstandings of the 'truth' is only ignoring all the faults of the other side. Unless you get your kicks off of supporting each others aggressions and intolerances and angering people you'll never meet, much less get to know and understand their decisions in life, then I suggest to go out there and actively learn your 'opposition'. If you can't/won't take the time to do that than you should not have the time to spew possibly ignorant and complete misrepresentations of people in today's society.\n \n And I'm not faulting the curious, of course. Question things; that's the best way to learn. I'm talking about all the people that are apparently coming down from the heavens to give me hardcore facts about how me and my loved ones' nature while not taking our opinion into even the slightest consideration.",
