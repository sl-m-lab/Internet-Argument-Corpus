   "Excerpted from NY Times, \"How to Cut Child Poverty in Half\", by Nancy Folbre, June 13, 2011.\n http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/13/how-to-cut-child-poverty-in-half .\n \n \"child poverty rate has trended upward in the United States since 2000, and children have proved economically vulnerable to increased unemployment. ................................ Most other rich countries rate higher on indicators of child well-being than either Britain or the United States. But we have more in common with Britain than most other countries, and rightfully pay closer attention to it. ...........................\n ....................... The ordinary policies in Britain that led to what many Americans would consider extraordinary results were these: an increase in the national minimum wage (currently about $9.70 an hour, compared with our $7.25), tax incentives to encourage single parents to move into paid employment, increased public benefits for parents, provision of universal preschool and regulations making it easier for parents of young children to request flexible work schedules\".",
