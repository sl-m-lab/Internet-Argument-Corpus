   "SINKING ECONOMY vs. NEOCON-ARTIST SPIN\n \n Today's GDP report showed the slowest quarterly growth since 2002. Consumer spending was the lowest since 2001. The NeoCon-Artist spin machine was immediately put in high gear following the report. \n \n The immediate response by some was that the economy had just \"hit a pothole.\" A more accurate statement would be it \"fell off a cliff.\" The DECLINE in the Final Sales number to -0.3 from the previous +4.6 is especially worrisome. Also, the huge increase in inventories gives further indication that much of production contributing to GDP was unsold.\n \n Below is a link to a partial copy of today's GDP report from Briefing.com (also see \"attachment.\")\n http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c190/unlawflcombatnt/1-27-06artGDPgrphT.gif\n \n Here's a link to Briefing.com's GDP report: GDP \n \n Given that consumer spending is 2/3 of all economic activity, the 1.1% change gives further evidence that the economy is slowing down. Christmas spending would be expected to make 4th quarter spending higher, rather than lower. Had the 4th quarter not included Christmas, consumer spending would have been lower still. \n \n With New Home prices declining sharply to a -3.4%, the source of home equity loan spending is also shrinking. Combined with a yearly decline in real hourly wages of 0.49 %, consumer spending can only be expected to decline further. (Wage information can be found at: BLS: Real Hourly Wages )\n \n In 2005, consumers spent 115% as much as they earned. The savings rate has declined to below 0. Can consumers continue to increase spending when their income is declining and the source of their borrowing is declining in value? Will production continue to increase if consumers' ability to purchase that production decreases? Will capital investment increase if purchase of the production it facilitates decreases?\n \n unlawflcombatnt\n \n EconomicPopulistCommentary\n \n Economic Patriot Forum",

   "While I do applaud this post in particular, and the statistics are welcome, I think we would interpret these facts in a very different manner, and I find many of the solutions you propose as more problematic than even Bush's incompetence. This is a matter of theory, and while I don't pretend to know who exactly you have drawn from in the pieces you write, much of it is fallacious.\n \n ie\n \nThe following is an example. Let's say a company produces items that sell for $100 with a production cost of $10, including $8 of labor cost. Let's say the company can sell 1,000 of these per day. How many workers will be hired? Enough workers to produce 1,000 items per day.\n \n Let's change one variable. Lets increase the labor cost to $28 per item, making the total production cost $30 per item. How many workers will be hired? Enough to produce 1,000 items per day. The SAME number as before, when labor costs were only $8 per item. \n\n \n A company has many choices. It is not the choice of producing \"1000 items for $100 each or nothing\", it may produce less items at a higher price, more items at a lower price, it may replace workers with machinery, or abandon the field altogether to open business in a less labour intensive market.\n \n Let us ignore for the moment these last two alternatives.\n \n Suppose I can sell 1000 items for $100 each, or I could sell 500 items for $150 each, and that for the sake of argument this requires half the amount of labour, while other costs remain steady. If my labor costs are only $8 per good, I will choose the first option - invest $10,000 and reap $90,000 in profit (rather than invest $6000 and reap $71,000 in profit). \n \n But if my labor costs are $28 per item, the first option costs me $28,000 in investment for $52,000 in profit. The second option costs $15,000 in investment for $60,000 in profit. \n \n I would be wise as an employer under such circumstances to fire a full 50% of my workforce and reap the rewards, the second 50% are simply costing me money. Given less dramatic wage changes the number of employees affected will be smaller, but they will always be affected.\n \n It is simply fallacious to assume that the price of goods sold and the amount produced will remain constant - this may be true in a dictatorship, but in the market economy rising wages always results in a reduced demand for labour.\n \n The idea of a \"profit eliminating wage level\" is also fallacious, as there is not a single wage level that will suddenly make all or most businesses unprofitable. There are businesses which are barely profitable, that even a small change in wage rate will make them unprofitable, there are others that are very profitable, such that even a large change could be withstood. I find it ironic that economic \"populists\" such as yourself endorse laws which would wipe out small businesses and leave only large corporations remaining.\n \n \nINVESTMENT DOES NOT CREATE JOBS\n \n Investment does not create jobs. Companies do not hire workers because they can \"afford\" them. Companies hire workers when they need them, and only when they need them. \n\n \n And when do businesses need workers? When those workers are sufficiently productive to justify their wages. What determines to a great extent the productivity of labour? The level of investment of course. A man working a 100 million dollar piece of machinery in a car factory is about 1000 times as productive as a man attempting to fabricate a sports car by hand. Accordingly it will be in the interests of companies who have a high degree of capital investment to hire workers when it is not in the interests of companies which do not to do so.\n \n In a free market such investment cannot be said to \"create jobs\" per se, since there is a near infinite supply of jobs available, it \"merely\" raises the wage rate. In a mixed economy though where there is a legislated or union enforced minimum wage, the level of capital investment to a large extent determines the unemployment rate. Which is why to introduce 1st world minimum wages in nations without much investment will result in mass unemployment.",

You can replace \"the market\" with \"the company\" in all discussion of price setting, it doesn't change the result of the example though. When the market cost of labour rises, the market determines that laying off some staff, producing less products and charging a higher price for goods will generate a higher rate of profit.\n \n If labour costs increase the relative profitability of producing smaller number of goods (sold at higher prices) and laying off staff increases, just as if labour costs decrease the relative profitability of putting on more staff and producing more goods (sold at lower prices) increases.\n \n \nSecond, it does not matter if you have a single man producing 10000 sports cars per day at a billion dollar machine unless there is a market for those sports cars.\n\n \n So are you saying that *both* investment and demand are important for determining if someone will be employed? If so I agree. I am not arguing investment is the sole determinant of whether someone will be employed, I am saying it is ONE factor, in contrast with the original poster's assertion that \"What difference does investment have on demand for workers? NONE. Absolutely zero.\".\n \n It may be unprofitable to employ someone to weave baskets by hand. But if I have a basket weaving machine already sitting there, the unprofitable becomes profitable, demand remaining the same.\n \n If demand for baskets rose, then employing even a by hand basket weaver may become profitable, but it is by no means the only way, or even the primary way that new employment opportunities arise.",

If the market price of labor increases and leads to laying off some workers, then demand decreases as well. Reducing supply under that circumstance will not allow for a higher price, just decrease profits due to decreased sales. \n \n Demand is a function of market segment and the desirablitly of your goods. Increasing wages and laying off workers decreases your market segment without changing the desirability of the goods.\n \n \n \n \nSo are you saying that *both* investment and demand are important for determining if someone will be employed?

But if I have a basket weaving machine already sitting there, the unprofitable becomes profitable, demand remaining the same.\n\n \n You are switching back and forth between micro economics and macro economics here. On the micro economic level (such as a basket weaving company), the addition of the basket weaving machine would indeed make your company more profitable. On the macroeconomic level, the pruchase of that machine also facilitates jobs fro themen who make the machine, and the people who service the machine, and the people who produce the electricity for the machine, and the folks wgho produce lubricants for that machine, and a bunch of basket hauling truckers, retail sales folks, etc....\n \n Does not matter, though. Without a demand for the baskets, your purchase of the machine is just a waste of money.\n \n There is NO CIRCUMSTANCE where supply creates demand. If supply could create demand, the demad for toxic waste, greenhouse gases, and raw sewage would be phenomenal. That is simply not how it works.",

At that time I knew a couple of the Silicone Valley venture capitalists who urged me to get on the gravy train, venture subscription side, while it was still rolling. Simple formula; put $50-100-million in, take it public, venture capital debt and handsome profit repaid with initial offering proceeds, lock company principal stock option sales for public image, let it run through the remaining initial issue cash, with no revenue it fails and 401k suckers take the beating.\n \n The housing bubble isn't much different except instead of the 401k crowd that industry has a far bigger sucker base using quasi-government mortgage entities that package highly inflated mortgages and sell securities based on ability to service debt.
