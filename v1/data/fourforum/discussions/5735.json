And if there is someone \"up there\" who will damn you to eternal torment if you don't do what he wants (which is one interpretation of the Bible) than that might effect the way you act.

   "@kronus\n Imagine you are shown god exists and did create the universe \"genesis stlye\". How would it change YOUR behaviour? Would it change YOUR ethics?\n\n \n An excellent question. I've always felt I've led a good life. My philosophy has been that if A) God wants some specific behavior from us and B) He can't make it clear what it is, then to heck with him. I lead a good life and if that isn't good enough than phooey. That wouldn't be a God I'd want to worship anyway. You understand of course that I don't except the mere existence of a book as God making his desires clear. \n \n Now all of a sudden we know that the Bible is in fact God telling us what he wants. The problem then becomes deciphering it. The Bible is not as cut and dried as some would like. God seems to undergo a radical personality shift between the OT and the NT, from a God of smiting to a God of love and tolerance. Which part are we to listen to? Do Paul's letters carry the same weight as the Gospel? I'd have alot of questions.\n \n I guess how much I'd change my life depends on how forthcoming God is. Is the only thing we've learned what you've spelled out? God exists, Genesis is correct? If that's all we've got, than I'd still be forced to judge God based on my own ethical standards, same as before. The mere fact that a God exists does not, in my opinion, mean He is worthy of worship or following. God does alot of stuff in the OT that seems unjustifiable to be, and I'm not willing to let things slide just becuase someone claims ineffability. So I guess I would still lead my life as best as I could, according to the standards I've developed. At least, that would be my intention. Knowing that God was in fact watching and judging me might, for example, put a damper on my support of gay rights. I'd feel like a coward, but it could happen.\n \n On the other hand, if God was willing to do a Q&A session and fill me in on a few things, and clarify a few points, then it's entierly possible that I might change my lifestyle. I really haven't written up my interview with God, so I'm not sure what I would ask or how the answers might change me, but I've got to assume that if I could chat with God, something about me would change.",

You way \"in a future where the outcome is foreknown, only one option is choosable:\". I don't see that as being true. All the options were chooseable , it just so happens that only one was chosen. All the options were there at the ciritical moment, and it was my will which decided which path would be taken. Likewise, you say \"the other options can never be chosen because they are not the ones you were foreseen to choose\". It's the cause and effect you cite here that I disagree with. The other options were not \"not chosen\" because of forshadowing. They weren't chosen because I didn't choose them. The decision was mine. \n \n Let me give an example. If I let go of a rock, it's going to fall. This is known ahead of time. But what causes the rock to fall? Is it destiny or fate, since we know it's going to happen? No, it's gravity. Even though we know ahead of time what will happen, it's still gravity that's the motivation. It's gravity that makes the rock fall. Likewise, even if you know ahead of time what I'll choose, I'm still the motivation, I'm still the one choosing. \n \n Another question to ponder. Once again I'm wearing a green shirt. Does the fact that I'm aware of this now mean I had no choice this morning? Only one choice was made, the other options never materialized. Does that mean that there was no real choice? If not, then why is knowing the outcome after the event different from someone knowing the outcome before?",

   "Mainly, the reason is you are incapable of making any other choice. YOu just THINK you have the choice. \n \n For there to be a choice, there has to be the possiblity of multiple outcomes.\n If there is only one possible outcome (because of 100% foreknowledge), then there is no choice. The uncertainly principle goes out the window, and we all are puppets, dancing to the strings of neccessity.\n\n You made the choice, he just happens to know what choice you are going to make in advance. This doesnt mean that he forced you to make that choice. If you were forced to make the choice, then free will would be taken away.",

   "No links as such but if you visit any of the physics groups eg. on Yahoo the material is occasionally discussed.\n 2 items spring to mind;\n 1, The observation of sub-atomic particles which are capable of time travel.\n (I'm not a quantum mechanic so can't really help you on that one)\n 2, An experiment to show the effect of temporal dilation as predicted by Einstein. Essentially the experiment involved 2 synchronised atomic clocks, one of which was flown around on Concorde, the one from the plane showed that the plane had experienced less time than the clock on the ground.\n \n As we exist in a state of linear time trying to think in terms of non-linear time really messes with your head.\n\n Yes, I have heard about the time dialation experiment, and also ran across a theory that if there were one particle that could travel both forward and backwards in time, it could theoretically make up all matter in the universe, cause it could appear everywhere at every moment by popping in and out of every instant at every coordinate. As well, time has no meaning to a photon because it travels at the speed of light. The beginning of the universe and now would be the same thing for the photon.",
