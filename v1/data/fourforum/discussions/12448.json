   "Gunman kills 15 in German school rampage - Europe- msnbc.com\n \n \nSTUTTGART, Germany - A 17-year-old gunman dressed in black opened fire at his former high school in southwestern Germany on Wednesday, killing at least 15 people before police shot him dead, officials said.\n \n Nine students and three teachers were among the dead, State Interior Minister Heribert Rech said. \n \n It was Germany's worst shooting since another teenage gunman killed 16 people and himself in another high school in 2002.\n \n Most of the slain students were found dead in the school and the gunman killed an adult outside the building as he escaped, regional police spokesman Klaus Hinderer said.\n \n \"He went into the school with a weapon and carried out a bloodbath,\" said regional police chief Erwin Hetger. \"I've never seen anything like this in my life.\"\n \n After the attack, the suspect fled the Albertville high school toward the center of Winnenden, a town of 28,000, Hinderer said, before police tracked him down.\n \n The teenager graduated from the school last year, police said.\n \n Witnesses said students jumped from the windows of the school building after the gunman\n opened fire. Concerned parents quickly swarmed around the school, which was evacuated during the incident.\n \n The man entered the school at 9:30 a.m. and opened fire, shooting at random, police said. Police said the suspect was dressed in a black.\n \n About 1,000 children attend the school, located in a suburb some 12 miles northeast of Stuttgart.\n \n In 2002, 19-year-old Robert Steinhaeuser shot and killed 12 teachers, a secretary, two students and a police officer before turning his gun on himself in the Gutenberg high school in Erfurt.\n \n Steinhaeuser, who had been expelled for forging a doctor's note, was a gun club member licensed to own weapons. The attack led Germany to raise the age for owning recreational firearms from 18 to 21.\n\n \n Well isn't that interesting. Germany has much stricter laws than America does when it comes to gun ownership, and their school shootings resulted in more death and devastation that Columbine. It's funny in a way, because the country with the tighter regulations is seeing more killings on school grounds than America, even though our laws aren't as strict.\n \n I guess that means all the nonsense about \"more gun laws make people safer\" is nothing but bull.",

On the gun boards I frequent, when someone says they have a problem, the first thing someone says in jest is, well whatever you do, don't see a doctor. The Brady's will sooner or later widen the scope of that law and seeing a doctor will cost you all of your guns. \n \n However that is not funny! That is the true advice gun owners are getting.

They want to know how I dealt with it, and what they can and should do. However, they definitely will not go to see a doctor.

   "This English author says: Any American citizens who are tempted to go down the road of prohibition might be advised to consider the experience of Britain.\n \n   Barack Obama will face huge opposition if he yields to gun control lobby \n The success of this politically correct initiative can easily be measured. In 1997, the year of the ban, there were 2,636 handgun offences; in 2007 there were 4,175. In England and Wales there are now 28 firearms offences committed every day. Gun crime is now one of the most formidable challenges to law and order.\n \n Or Americans might look at Australia where, a year ago, a Draconian ban enforced the destruction of 640,381 personal firearms, at a cost of more than $500 million. The results? After 25 years of steady decrease in robberies with firearms, this offence increased by 44 per cent in one year. Homicides with guns increased by 3.2 per cent, assaults by 8.6 per cent. In the state of Victoria homicides with firearms rose 300 per cent. Break-ins and assaults on the elderly hugely increased.\n \n Criminals and lunatics will always find access to guns; but they will be less willing to use them if their victims are armed too. What doctrinaire liberal governments have done is make a Western movie in which the guys in the black hats all have guns, the guys in white hats do not. The Second Amendment to the American constitution and public opinion recognise that only a totalitarian government disarms its citizens. If Barack Obama tries to legislate on behalf of his supporters in the gun control lobby, he will have the mother of all fights on his hands. \n",

   "Look what I found. I edited it for who, what, when, and how. \n \n   Preventing School Shootings -- A Summary of a U.S. Secret Service Safe School Initiative Report \n There is no one reason why school shootings occur, and no one type of student who becomes a shooter. This article dispels the myths and stereotypes about school shooters. \n \n Children who attack can be any age and from any ethnic group, race, or family situation. Contrary to assumptions that some of our youth \"just snap\"-they don't. They plan.\n \n The National Institute of Justice has joined forces with the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S. Department of Education to assess ways to prevent school shootings. The Secret Service has a long tradition of protecting our Nation's leaders by identifying, assessing, and managing persons who might pose a threat of targeted violence Targeted violence is a term developed by the Secret Service to refer to any incident of violence where a known (or knowable) attacker selects a particular target prior to the act of violence. Because of the Secret Service's expertise in the study and prevention of targeted violence, the Secretary of Education asked the agency to conduct a similar operational study of school shootings. \n \n The findings clearly emphasize the importance of paying attention and listening to America's young people. More than a handful of adults, parents, teachers, school administrators and counselors, coaches, and law enforcement-can make an important contribution to and play a key role in preventing violence on school grounds. Young people who need help often do not keep it a secret. They may exhibit obvious warning signs either through behavior or remarks, such as voicing problems or grievances, complaining about persecution or bullying, or showing signs of depression or desperation.\n \n \n What We Know\n \n Prior to most incidents, the attacker told someone about his idea or plan. In more than three-fourths of the cases examined in the Safe School Initiative, the attacker told a\n friend, schoolmate, or sibling about his idea for a possible attack before taking action. In one case, an attacker made comments to at least 24 friends and classmates about his interest in killing other students, building bombs, or carrying out an attack at the school. Some of the conversations were long enough that peers conveyed detailed information about the plans, including the date it would happen.\n \n However, the study identified a major barrier to the prevention of targeted school violence. In nearly all of the cases, the person who was told about the impending incident\n was a peer, and rarely did anyone bring the information to an adult's attention. It is important, therefore, that threat assessment inquiries involve efforts to gather information\n from anyone who may have contact with the student in question. It also is important to decrease barriers that may prevent students who have information from coming forward. In addition, both schools and investigators need a thoughtful, effective system for handling and analyzing any information that is provided.\n \n Although some attackers did make threats, most did not threaten their target directly. The researchers indicate it is helpful to distinguish between making a threat (telling people they intend to harm someone) and posing a threat (engaging in behaviors that indicate intent, planning, or preparation for an attack). The study notes that plans to prevent school violence should involve adults attending to concerns when someone poses a threat rather than waiting for a direct threat.\n \n There Is No Stereotype or Profile\n \n There is no accurate or useful profile of \"the school shooter.\" The personality and social characteristics of the shooters varied substantially. They came from a variety of racial and\n ethnic backgrounds and varied in age from 11 to 21 years. Family situations ranged from intact families to foster homes. Academic performance ranged from excellent to failing. Few had been diagnosed with any mental disorder prior to the incident, and less than one-third had histories of drug or alcohol abuse. \n \n Attackers Are Encouraged by Others\n \n In many cases, other students were involved in some capacity. The attackers acted alone in at least two-thirds of the cases. However, in almost half of the cases, friends or fellow students influenced or encouraged the attacker to act. ...\n \n Bullying Can Be a Factor\n \n In a number of cases, bullying played a key role in the decision to attack. A number of attackers had experienced bullying and harassment that were longstanding and severe. In those cases, the experience of bullying appeared to play a major role in motivating the attack at school. Bullying was not a factor in every case, and clearly not everychild who is bullied in school will pose a risk. However, in a number of cases, attackers described experiences of being bullied in terms that approached torment.\n \n Attackers told of behaviors that, if they occurred in the workplace, would meet the legal definition of harassment. That bullying played a major role in a number of school shootings should strongly support ongoing efforts to combat bullying in American schools.\n \n Warning Signs Are Common\n \n Most attackers engaged in some behavior prior to the incident that caused concern or indicated a need for help. In more than half of the cases, the attacker's behavior caught the attention of more than one person. Behaviors that led others (e.g., school officials, police, fellow students) to be concerned included those related to the attack, such as efforts to obtain a gun. But they also included behaviors not clearly related to the attack. More than three-fourths of the attackers threatened to kill themselves, made suicidal gestures, or tried to kill themselves before their attacks. In one case, a student wrote several poems for English class that involved themes of homicide and suicide as possible solutions to feelings of hopelessness. School authorities ultimately determined that his was a family problem and did not intervene. He later went to school and killed two people. Many attackers had a history of feeling extremely depressed or desperate.\n \n A significant problem in preventing targeted violence is determining how best to respond to students who are already known to be in trouble. This study indicates the importance of giving attention to students who are having difficulty coping with major losses or perceived failures, particularly when feelings of desperation and hopelessness are involved.\n",

   "Look what I found. I edited it for who, what, when, and how. \n \n   Preventing School Shootings -- A Summary of a U.S. Secret Service Safe School Initiative Report \n\n \n Tither, that's some good info. Unfortunately, a lot people ignore the warning signs until it's too late. I think the problem lies that we as a society choose to ignore these people (that is people with psychological problems) and throw them aside. To me it seems high school has become more than just about teaching. It seems to me that kids are now starting to become a lot more violent towards their peers either by hitting, using some very harsh words, being ignored. When I was in high school, this rarely happened. When it did though, students in our school would usually step in and stop it. In one incident, a younger student (that is pretty smart kid, he was like 10 I believe) was attending our school. The other freshmen didn't like him (jealousy? I don't know. He wasn't bad student) and they would always pick on him, throw his backpack up in the trees. The poor kid would stand there crying. My friends and I caught them one day trying to throw his backpack up in the trees again, so we gave them a \"friendly\" lesson on how to treat others. To the say the least the kid finally felt some comfort being at school (he wasn't bullied very much after that). Trust me, I have seen the way kids turn out when they get bullied and ostracized. They turn demented and vengeful. I believe the reasoning behind these acts is for revenge. They were treated badly and unfairly so they have no other recourse (because they have no friends or anyone to rely on) other than to commit an act of violence towards those who wronged them. The parents? Really I think parents should be more alert. Parenthood doesn't stop when kids reach 13/14 and go into high school. I think it weren't for my parents I would probably be in jail right now or kicking the #### out of some crackhead asking where's my money. Sometimes I felt they were tough on me, but I understand some of their reasoning now. Still, no one has the right to commit an act of violence towards another without some good reason (like the other person trying to kill you or physically hurt you). For this kid it was too late and he knew it, so he took his own life in the end. Unfortunate, but once you cross that line you are beyond saving.",

The burden of proof in on the Anti side to show that these guns in our society present a overwhelming danger that society can in no other way deal with, other than to to infringe on a Right that even says Shall Not Be Infringed.\n \n As hard as the best and the brightest Anti-gun people in this Nation tried, meaning the CDC and The National Academy of Sciences, they could not find that necessary link. \n \n If one were to play fair and be respectful to the rule of Law, and be respectful to the Constitution of the United States, this line of attack on the 2nd amendment should stop! We should ALL be seeking solutions to crime and violence that DO Work, and quit persecuting the Constitution!\n \n We are wasting Valuable time and resources pursuing this failed policy!",

   "I am beginning to note a pattern on the Anti side. I say one thing and then the Anti side says the same thing but in a different way then claims controversy, or in this case attributes quotes that I did not say. \n No. Sir this is what the article said, and what I quoted is.\n  who issued a 328-page report based on 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study. \n Dead on accurate!\n \n Could you be confusing this with the CDC's study?\n\n This is getting confusing. So an article that is entitled \"Gun control doesn't reduce crime, violence, say studies\" is not claiming that gun control is ineffective?\n \n \n \nThey also said more study was needed but 51 of the best gun control studies, 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study have already been done.

It's findings were inconclusive on Concealed Carry, but not to our side in general.\n \n One of the report's chapters was entitled \"The Use of Firearms to Defend Against Criminals\".

It certainly doesn't close the door on further debate and research. Some of the report's major findings that I can see:\n \n \n\n *There is no credible evidence that \"right-to-carry\" laws, which allow qualified adults to carry concealed handguns, either decrease or increase violent crime. To date, 34 states have enacted these laws.\n \n *There is almost no evidence that violence-prevention programs intended to steer children away from guns have had any effects on their behavior, knowledge, or attitudes regarding firearms. More than 80 such programs exist.\n \n *Research has found associations between gun availability and suicide with guns, but it does not show whether such associations reveal genuine patterns of cause and effect. \n \n *Research linking firearms to criminal violence and suicide is seriously limited by a lack of credible information on who owns firearms and on individuals' encounters with violence, the report says.\n \n *Many Americans keep firearms to defend themselves against criminals, but research devoted to understanding the defensive and deterrent effects of guns has resulted in mixed and sometimes widely divergent findings, the report says. In addition, the accuracy of responses in gun-use surveys is a topic that has not been thoroughly investigated. \n \n Many Americans keep firearms to defend themselves against criminals, but research devoted to understanding the defensive and deterrent effects of guns has resulted in mixed and sometimes widely divergent findings, the report says. In addition, the accuracy of responses in gun-use surveys is a topic that has not been thoroughly investigated. The committee called for systematic research to define what is being measured in studies of defensive and deterrent effects of guns, to reduce reporting errors in national gun-use surveys, and to explore ways that different data sets may be linked to answer complex questions.\n \n Likewise, new research tools are needed to evaluate right-to-carry laws. Existing studies that use similar methods and data yield very dissimilar findings. Some studies indicate that the laws reduce violent crime. Other studies show negligible effects, while still others suggest that they increase violent crime. It is impossible to draw any strong conclusions about their effects from these studies, the report says.\n \n *Market-based interventions aimed at reducing criminals' access to guns include taxes on weapons and ammunition, limits on the number of firearms that can be purchased in a given time period, and gun 'buy back' initiatives. Arguments for and against these approaches are largely based on speculation rather than scientific evidence. \n\n Data on Firearms and Violence Too Weak to Settle Policy Debates; Comprehensive Research Effort Needed\n \n \nWe have an Inalienable Constitutional Right to Keep and Bear Arms.\n\n The fantasy that the Second Amendment was based on is that virtually every citizen would become some type of soldier, capable of defeating standing armies and their professionally trained soldiers.

Time to move on.\n\n DUDE! :) You fail to understand the implications of OUR Government having to MURDER 2 or 3 Million of it's very own citizens would have on those Free American citizens still alive! That prospect, like nuclear war, makes usurpation unthinkable. \n \n Although a usurpation seems impossible to us now, what does it matter to you what brave Americans willing to die for our Freedoms recognized by our Supreme Court and recognized as absolutely guaranteed by our Constitution choose to do? What you would choose to do during a usurpation is your business. I however, took an oath when I went into the Army to support and defend the Constitution from all enemies both foreign and domestic. As far as I know, an oath has no expiration date.\n \n Here is what Alexander Hamilton said when selling the Constitution to We the people.   FEDERALIST No. 28 HAMILTON \n If the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that  original right of self-defense  which is paramount to all positive forms of government, and which against the usurpations of the national rulers, may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state. In a single state, if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers, the different parcels, subdivisions, or districts of which it consists, having no distinct government in each, can take no regular measures for defense.  The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms, without concert, without system, without resource; except in their courage and despair.  The usurpers, clothed with the forms of legal authority, can too often crush the opposition in embryo.\n \n The obstacles to usurpation and the facilities of resistance increase with the increased extent of the state, provided the citizens understand their rights and are disposed to defend them. \n\n These words sound harsh to us now, but our Founding Fathers were insurrectionist Bearing Arms against their very own Government, and who, incidentally, went up against the most powerful Army in the World and won. Their points of view created this bastion of Freedom we thankfully get to take for granted!",
