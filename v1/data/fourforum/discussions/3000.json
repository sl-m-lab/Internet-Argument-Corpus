   "In the economic dead end which Georgia has found itself in Tbilisi is forced to divert people from internal problems, i.e. low living standard. For this purpose Saakashvili has been heightening tensions around Abkhasia and South Ossetya. Tbilisi sets big hopes on construction and exploitation of Georgian strip of Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline. However it had been estimated by the analysts of ex-president Shevardnadze that the pipeline will give small number of work places and insignificant profit. To all this adds the strive of the young aggressive president to get control over Abkhasia and Ossetya by force. It will certainly lead to guerrilla activities on the side of the conquered autonomies. In the result it'll be a hard task for the US to provide security of the Georgian strip of Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan. Iraq has taught us a lot. This only means that such a pushing Georgian president won't hold in his chair for a long time. There're already some signs of Saakashvili losing American support. During his meeting with representatives of human rights organizations financed by the US he was blamed for more frequent human rights violations in Georgia, as well as breaking up of meetings and demonstrations by the Georgian authorities. Noteworthy that the American press gave much more attention to the fact than the Georgian.",
