   "Ad Hominem: \n This is the best logical fallacy, and if you disagree with me, well, you suck. \n \n Appeal To False Authority: \n Your logical fallacies aren't logical fallacies at all because Einstein said so. Einstein also said that this one is better. \n \n Appeal To Emotion: \n See, my mom, she had to work three jobs on account of my dad leaving and refusing to support us, and me with my elephantitis and all, all our money went to doctor's bills so I never was able to get proper schooling. So really, if you look deep down inside yourself, you'll see that my fallacy here is the best. \n \n Appeal to Fear: \n If you don't accept Appeal to Fear as the greatest fallacy, then THE TERRORISTS WILL HAVE WON. Do you want that on your conscience, that THE TERRORISTS WILL HAVE WON because you were a pansy who didn't really think that Appeal to Fear was worth voting for, and you wanted to vote for something else? Of course not, and neither would the people you let die because THE TERRORISTS WILL HAVE WON. \n \n Appeal To Force: \n If you don't agree that Appeal to Force is the greatest logical fallacy, I will kick your XXX. \n \n Appeal To Majority: \n Most people think that this fallacy is the best, so clearly it is. \n \n Appeal To Novelty: \n The Appeal to Novelty's a new fallacy, and it blows all your crappy old fallacies out the water! All the cool kids are using it: it's OBVIOUSLY the best. \n \n Appeal To Numbers: \n Millions think that this fallacy is the best, so clearly it is. \n \n Appeal To Tradition: \n We've used Appeal to Tradition for centuries: how can it possibly be wrong? \n \n Argumentum Ad Nauseam: \n Argumentum ad nauseam is the best logical fallacy. \n Argumentum ad nauseam is the best logical fallacy. \n Argumentum ad nauseam is the best logical fallacy. \n Argumentum ad nauseam is the best logical fallacy. \n Argumentum ad nauseam is the best logical fallacy. \n Argumentum ad nauseam is the best logical fallacy. \n Argumentum ad nauseam is the best logical fallacy. \n \n Begging The Question: \n Circular reasoning is the best fallacy and is capable of proving anything. \n Since it can prove anything, it can obviously prove the above statement. \n Since it can prove the first statement, it must be true. \n Therefore, circular reasoning is the best fallacy and is capable of proving anything. \n \n Burden Of Proof: \n Can you prove that Burden of Proof isn't the best logical fallacy? \n \n Complex Question: \n Have you stopped beating your wife and saying Complex Question isn't the best fallacy? \n \n False Dilemma: \n I've found that either you think False Dilemma is the best fallacy, or you're a terrorist. \n \n False Premise: \n All of the other fallacies are decent, but clearly not the best as they didn't come from my incredibly large and sexy brain. \n \n Gambler's Fallacy: \n In all the previous talks about this subject, Gambler's Fallacy won, so I just know the Gambler's Fallacy is going to win this time! \n \n Guilt By Association: \n You know who else preferred those other logical fallacies? \n *(insert pictures of Hitler, Stalin, and Pol Pot here)* \n \n Non Sequitur: \n Non Sequitur is the best fallacy because none of my meals so far today have involved asparagus. \n \n Post Hoc/False Cause: \n Since I've started presuming that correlation equals causation, violent crime has gone down 54%. \n \n Red Herring: \n They say that to prove your fallacy is the best requires extraordinary evidence, because it's an extraordinary claim. Well, I'd like to note that \"Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence\" is itself an extraordinary claim.",

   "Double Barreled Question:\n Do you agree that having a good economy is desirable and that the double-barreled question is the best fallacy?\n \n Reductio Ad Hitlerum:\n You disagree that Reductio ad Hitlerum is the best fallacy? You must be a Nazi!\n \n Slippery Slope:\n If you disagree that Slippery slope is the best fallacy, that will lead to a chain of events that will inevitably result in you being banned.\n \n Bulverism:\n If you disagree that the Bulverism is the best fallacy, you disagree because the Bulverism is stopping you from trolling.\n \n Loaded Question:\n So when did you finally accept that the Loaded Question is the best logical fallacy?\n \n Noob Logic (A term I coined, a special type of ad Homenim):\n Anyone who wastes time disagreeing that noob logic is the best fallacy has no social life and lives in their mother's basement.\n I refered to this as noob logic because low level players (refered to as \"noobs\") on online games often accuse more experienced players of being losers and lacking a social life, and that they got their skill/level in those games because they had nothing better to do.\n \n Other fallacies that don't reference the fallacy itself.\n \n Island Mentality:\n People at 4forums.com are smarter than everyone else on the internet.",
