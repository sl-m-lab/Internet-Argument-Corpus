   "Hi,\n \n for a big school research project I am trying to get a deeper impression about the conflict between Evolution and Creation.\n \n I have read and looked through many different resources about the topic, especially other threads in this forum about the current conflict of teaching Evolution at school or not to...\n \n So if I would give a statement here that would meet the beliefs of Evolutionists, I would get criticized by Creationists who do not agree and think their beliefs are better and true... (also other way), where if I would give a christian opinion)\n \n So giving any opinion would just lead to an \"angered\" discussion where everyone just wants to say that his/her beliefs are true.\n \n I myself am not sure what exactly to believe. I am not a Christian, but I also don't believe that everything just popped up one day...\n \n Unfortunately I know that the truth isn't known because nothing has completely been proven and know one really knows what is right.\n \n So I just want to stay with facts and proofs (at least sincere opinions with background)...\n \n I am looking for proof for both points of view...\n \n \n \n \n If you are a supporter of Divine Creation:\n What exactly do you believe? (who/what created what, when, where and how?)\n What are your proofs that show that Creation is true (in your opinion true)?\n How can you completely believe that the words in the Bible is the unfallible word of God?\n How can you be sure that your opinion is the right thing?\n Should Evolution be taught at school?

Think about it from a high-level perspective just for starters. A woman has sextuplets and it makes national news today. Do you really think any of these:\n ghosts\n psychics\n alien life (in vehicles or otherwise)\n alien abductions\n god\n \n Would somehow be accidentally missed by news organizations around the globe? Of course not, they are fiction. It's why you also do not see flying zebras on the news, they simply do not have any evidence to support them, and they aren't even rationally supported theories for the most part (alien life and abductions are theoretically possible, the others are not to our knowledge).\n \n More to the point, you are incorrect with your reference to \"visions and UFOs\" as evidence.\n \n Vision of what...what physical, testable, observable object was it a vision of? If you cannot verify it, it is not \"evidence\" as you claim. It's just someone telling you something that could be true, or false. How do we determine if it's true or false? Justification..i.e. evidence and rational explanation. Of which, you, and they, present neither. Thus, it's not evidence.\n \n UFO's, by definition, are unidentifed, not \"identified as alien life\". UNIDENTIFIED. That is, unknown. For you, or anyone, to incorrectly conclude a UFO is \"evidence\" of extraterrestrial life, is just a mistake, not evidence.\n \n Neither of these should be respected by the education system as factual evidence in support of a theory that contradicts the accepted and undisputed theory of how life evolves on earth. Yes, that's right, it's still going on.\n \n #1 there is no other substantial body of evidence that supports any theory other then evolution\n #2 there is nothing in the theory of evolution that does not comprehend the whole of how life changes on earth.\n \n Evolution is a fact, and is proven. It is just as \"proven\" as gravity, the physics of light, the color of the sky.\n \n There is no debate on evolution in the scientific community. Thus, there is no debate on evolution. Yes, some christian ignorants believe, based on faith (you know what faith is right? It's belief WITHOUT EVIDENCE), that not only is there a god (which god??), who created things, but that this somehow ALSO makes the justified and fact of evolution being the mechanism of change in all life on earth, as false (!).\n \n To act like their is a debate, is to display ignorance of the subject matter. That's OK, most of us are ignorant about a GREAT many things. I say this only because you have the power to research it (Maybe 2 days of moderate reading) and arrive at the exact same, correct conclusions. If you are religious and refuse to learn and accept facts if they contradict with your religion...then don't bother I suppose. You can remain a deciever.\n \n Not only am I no better than you, if you research the subject you can easily meet, or exceed my knowledge on the subject. So please don't assume I'm speaking from some superior vantage point. Knowledge is free, and all are welcome to it....\n \n -Mach",

This is because even though such signal could be construed as due to some kind of intelligence, it is so short that its occurrence can just as easily be explained by chance. Given the choice, a sensible scientist would follow Ockham's razor and conclude that the signal does not constitute enough evidence for extraterrestrial intelligence. However, also according to Dembski, if the signal were long enough to encode all the prime numbers between 2 and 101, the SETI people would open the champagne and celebrate all night. Why? Because such signal would be both too complex to be explained by chance and would be specifiable, meaning that it is not just a random sequence of numbers, it is an intelligible message.\n\n \n \n I don't know why you didn't find that exactly like that on the SETI website, but if you would research some more you would find that out...\n \n \n btw: we are going off-topic...",

   "Hi all, I was just browsing this forum and I thought it was pretty interesting that some people are trying to argue against evolution (in the 21st century). :)\n \n O well, the reason I left this post was to question the statement repeated by a few in the thread \"All life came from a common ancestor.\"\n \n All known life works basically along the same mechanism. There are cells with fatty membranes to separate the metabolism from the surroundings. There is a DNA-RNA based genetic mechanism. There are always polypeptides and proteins with variations on the same basic structure type. This would lead us to think that since all life shares these things there must have been at some point one organism with all these things present and it is the one common ancestor. \n \n But it didn't have to be. There could have been several pre-organisms (protocells) that had just crossed the threshold from pre-life to living with different variations on the DNA-RNA-lipid-protein theme. These could have competed and/or cooperated to form new organisms with some parts from over here and some parts from over there. There could have been a whole class of these types of proto-organisms that led to different types of similar (but not the same) organisms whose progeny could be traced forward to organisms living today. I think it would be a more basic form of convergent evolution.\n \n I'm just saying that it's not utterly necessary for there to be a single common ancestor.

You don't understand how occam's razor works.\n \n It works when you have two competing theories; these theories must have falsifiable, verifiable evidence and mechanisms. If neither do, then neither are good. If one does and the other one doesn't, then the one that does is superior.\n \n Of course the lightening was unnecessary. It was part of the example of not being necessary. It was showing unnecessary and completely unworkable mechanisms and explanations.\n \n God with a lightning bolt IS wrong and superfluous. The other isn't, not because it doesn't have God, but because it uses something that is plausible.\n \n I easily showed that.\n \n \n \n\n how so? because you say?\n\n \n Short answer: Yes, because I say so. I am rarely, if ever, wrong, because I base my answers on objective logical analysis of what you say. If you don't like my critique of what you say, stop saying stuff that is logically incorrect.\n \n It's not a nitpick, it's a problem with the way you amphibolously word your sentences.\n \n better answer: No. Not because I say. Because logic and math equation dictates so. When God becomes a verifiable, falsifiable entity that can be used as a mechanism, then he will be valid. Untill then, God is always invalid.",

   "it's not easily debunked. The point is when you include God, it automatically becomes shaved away by the Razor. This isn't rocket science.

You misunderstand.\n \n occam's razor-\n \n <philosophy< The English philosopher, William of Occam\n (1300-1349) propounded Occam's Razor:\n \n Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem.\n \n (Latin for \"Entities should not be multiplied more than\n necessary\"). That is, the fewer assumptions an explanation of\n a phenomenon depends on, the better it is.\n \n For example, some claim that God caused himself to exist and\n also caused the universe to exist - he was the \"first cause\" -\n whereas Occam's Razor suggests that if one accepts the\n possibility of something causing itself then it is better to\n assume that it was the universe that caused itself rather than\n God because this explanation involves fewer entities.\n \n The negation of Occam's Razor would suggest that an\n arbitrarily complex explanation is just as good as the\n simplest one.
