   "Way back in 1972 a liberal, a guy named Stewart Udall, Secretary of the Interior under Kennedy and LBJ, 1961-1968, warned us:\n \nAt the moment there are more than 112 million motor vehicles on the American road. Henry Ford II recently predicted that auto buyers in this country will purchase nearly eleven million new cars this year. And other Detroit executives look forward to 178 million registered vehicles in the United States by 1985.\n \n Detroit's short-run forecasts may indeed prove accurate. But how long can this growth continue?\n \n The environmental effects of the automobile are well known: motor vehicles cause, for example, as much as 75 percent of the noise and 80 percent of the air pollution in our cities, and the industry must face mounting pressure from environmentalists. There is another, even more compelling constraint on the proliferation of cars. Surprising as it may seem, American oil companies, which during the 1960s increased their production of gasoline by 64 percent, will not be able to provide enough petroleum to fill the gas tanks of some sixty-five million additional autos expected by 1985.\n\n The Last Traffic Jam - Magazine - The Atlantic\n \n But, ya know, conservatives had their ears so plugged up with greed they never heard and figured it out.\n \n Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! That's all conservatives think about.",
