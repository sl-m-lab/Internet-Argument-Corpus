   "For some odd reason, the mainstream media hasn't been talking much about a foiled al-Qaeda plot to kill an estimated 80,000 people in Jordan using chemical weapons and tons of explosives. I was reading about this in a small little article on msnbc.com, and I found something very interesting which you guys should see....below is an excerpt.\n \n \n AMMAN, Jordan - Al-Qaida plotted bombings and poison gas attacks against the U.S. Embassy and other targets in Jordan, two conspirators said in a confession aired Monday on Jordanian state television.\n \n \n Azmi al-Jayousi, identified as the head of the Jordanian cell of al-Qaida, appeared Monday in a 20-minute taped program and described meeting Jordanian militant Abu-Musab al-Zarqawi in neighboring Iraq  to plan the foiled plot.\n \n A commentator said the plotters wanted to kill \"80,000\" Jordanians and had targeted the prime minister's office, intelligence headquarters and the U.S. Embassy.\n \n Just wanted to let you guys know the al-Qaeda/Iraq connection here, see what you think of it.\n \n And for those you don't know, Zarqawi is one of the senior al-Qaeda leaders, and the one who is supposedly behind the Basra oil field attacks this week.",

   "The Other Bush Lie\n \n By Jim Lobe, TomPaine.com\n July 15, 2003\n \n As calls mount for a full-scale investigation into the Bush administration's manipulation of intelligence on Iraq's nonexistent nuclear and chemical weapons program, let's hope that the other causus belli on which the administration based its war - the alleged link between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein - also gets the scrutiny it deserves. \n \n \n While the link was hyped less by administration officials than by right-wing idealogues and the conservative press, an organized campaign was nonetheless launched to persuade the American public that such a connection was real - and represented a mortal threat. \n \n \n A hint of such orchestration came in a June interview between \"Meet the Press\" host Tim Russert and former Gen. Wesley Clark, as publicized by the press watchdog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR): \n \n \n \n Clark: \"There was a concerted effort during the fall of 2001, starting immediately after 9/11 to pin 9/11 and the terrorism problem on Saddam Hussein.\" Russert: \"By who? Who did that?\" Clark: \"Well, it came from the White House, it came from people around the White House. It came from all over. I got a call on 9/11. I was on CNN, and I got a call at my home saying, 'You got to say this is connected. This is state-sponsored terrorism. This has to be connected to Saddam Hussein.' I said, 'But - I'm willing to say it - but what's your evidence?' And I never got any evidence.\"\n \n \n Clark has never said who called him, but we can identify others who were asserting the same connection both on television and in print at the same time. \n \n \n Without explicitly citing Iraq, Defense Policy Board (DPB) chair Richard Perle suggested in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks that there had to be a state sponsor behind them. \"This could not have been done without help of one or more governments,\" he told The Washington Post. \"Someone taught these suicide bombers how to fly large airplanes. I don't think that can be done without the assistance of large governments. You don't walk in off the street and learn how to fly a Boeing 767.\" \n \n \n Ex-CIA chief James Woolsey, Jr. was more direct. Speaking with Peter Jennings, he suggested Iraq was behind the 1993 bombing of the Trade Center and continued: \"[I]t's not impossible that terrorist groups could work together with the government, that ... the Iraqi government has been quite closely involved with a number of Sunni terrorist groups and ... and on some matters has had direct contact with bin Laden.\" \n \n \n He repeated that claim in an interview with Wolf Blitzer. Appearing with the State Department's former counterterrorism chief, Larry Johnson, Woolsey said, \"My suspicion - it's no more than that at this point - is that there could be some government action involved together with bin Laden or a major terrorist group. And one strong suspect there I think would be the government of Iraq.\" (Johnson thought this highly unlikely. \"Saddam is a lot of things,\" he said, \"but he's not crazy.\") \n \n \n read the rest here\n \n http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=16420",

If the good old boy's CIA was still in place instead of the current bureaucratic monolith eagerly awaiting COLAs, merit raises and retirement, there wouldn't be a problem. We'd just do another Gulf of Tonkin or whatever else it took to refocus public opinion. The UN is a fading possibility due to the levels of violence, an excellent gauge of ever-increasing participation by disgruntled Iraqis, so perhaps retaliation with additional force will be their (the administration) only avenue of justification.

THe ME is not like europe, where most people speak english.\n \n Your assesment seem dead on regarding what it took for Saddam to control the region, and I thik you are right that it was naive of Americans to think we could just roll in there and take over. It seems that we have appointed a Baathist who is on record as saying he was \"proud to have served Hussein\" (talking about Saleh, of course) to take fallujah back. Several shia members of the governing council claim he was instumental in the slaughter following the shia uprising after gulf I. Of course, the people in falluja are claiming a victory against the US troops. \n \n The Us claims that if Saleh can not get the heavy weapons out of the city, they will go in and take them by force. This is a lot of pretty heavy sabre rattling by the US, considering they took relatively heavy casualties during the seige on falluja when compared to the rest of the war, and they were doing their best to simply hold their fortified positions\n \n You make a good point about cultural differences, and I think people have trouble understanding the depth of these differences. For example, jimstrucking said above:\n \n \nI believe we should pull out when the left over military arms are considered insignificant and relative stability has been handed over to a duly elected Iraqi government. It may take years.\n\n \n In the middle east, you can stop at many gas stations, fill your tank, and pick up a couple cases of 7.62x39 and a dozen spare clips for your AK. Any cab driver at ay airport can tell you where to pick up an RPG. In order to clear Iraq of these weapons, we would have to institute a police action of unprecedented scale. Not only would we have to clear Iraq of these weapons (an incredible feat on its own) we would have to either clear the surrounding coutries of them, or lock down the Iraqi border completely. We can't even lock down our own border completely, doing so in Iraq seems an impossibility. \n \n THis is becasue, while AMericans seldom ventre outside f the US, even to canada or mexico, unless they happen to live on the border, people in the middle east drift between countries farily regularly, and they sometimes take their RPGs with them. THis is one of the reasons that stopping arms smuggling in the middle east is so difficult, for the most part they never really thought of it as smuggling. There are still beduin roaming the desert over there that have no idea where the borders are, and they ruotinely travel well armed. Owning a heavy machine gun and an RPG, or a bunch of mortar rounds and a couple of launch tubes, is no big deal.\n \n People in the middle east may not have all the rights that Americans enjoy, but they certainly have the RKBA down.",

It would take a BIG army to root them out and disarm them. Even the sheriff left a message at the country store for people when he had a warrant to serve. Have you known people like that or traveled in non-US countries where there were areas you were warned to stay out of? And knew why? I ask only because many Americans are not familiar with other cultures within or outside of our country.",

   "Do you mean that 38% of the coalition troops don't speak english, or that only 38% of the US troops speak arabic? If it is the latter, I think the number is MUCH lower. The US government will hire just about anybody as a translator right now. THe ME is not like europe, where most people speak english.\n \n Your assesment seem dead on regarding what it took for Saddam to control the region, and I thik you are right that it was naive of Americans to think we could just roll in there and take over. It seems that we have appointed a Baathist who is on record as saying he was \"proud to have served Hussein\" (talking about Saleh, of course) to take fallujah back. Several shia members of the governing council claim he was instumental in the slaughter following the shia uprising after gulf I. Of course, the people in falluja are claiming a victory against the US troops. \n \n The Us claims that if Saleh can not get the heavy weapons out of the city, they will go in and take them by force. This is a lot of pretty heavy sabre rattling by the US, considering they took relatively heavy casualties during the seige on falluja when compared to the rest of the war, and they were doing their best to simply hold their fortified positions\n \n You make a good point about cultural differences, and I think people have trouble understanding the depth of these differences. For example, jimstrucking said above:\n \n \n \n In the middle east, you can stop at many gas stations, fill your tank, and pick up a couple cases of 7.62x39 and a dozen spare clips for your AK. Any cab driver at ay airport can tell you where to pick up an RPG. In order to clear Iraq of these weapons, we would have to institute a police action of unprecedented scale. Not only would we have to clear Iraq of these weapons (an incredible feat on its own) we would have to either clear the surrounding coutries of them, or lock down the Iraqi border completely. We can't even lock down our own border completely, doing so in Iraq seems an impossibility. \n \n THis is becasue, while AMericans seldom ventre outside f the US, even to canada or mexico, unless they happen to live on the border, people in the middle east drift between countries farily regularly, and they sometimes take their RPGs with them. THis is one of the reasons that stopping arms smuggling in the middle east is so difficult, for the most part they never really thought of it as smuggling. There are still beduin roaming the desert over there that have no idea where the borders are, and they ruotinely travel well armed. Owning a heavy machine gun and an RPG, or a bunch of mortar rounds and a couple of launch tubes, is no big deal.\n \n People in the middle east may not have all the rights that Americans enjoy, but they certainly have the RKBA down.\n\n \n Have you ever been to the Middle East?",

   "I'm not for taking guns away from Americans either. However, there's no need for any of the non-military to own a frickin' machine gun. If you can't kill a deer with a bolt action or lever action or a pump or a single shot rifle, you don't need to be hunting.\n\n \n The RKBA in the US has nothing to do with hunting. It is about being able to effectively resist an oppresive or tyranical government. IF you look into the writings of those who drafted and ratified the bill of rights, it becomes VERY clear that the civilians right to own military type weaponry was exactly what they were protecting. The supreme court even recognised this in the Miller case, where they ruled that a shotgun with a barrel less than 10 inches was not protected by the second ammendment unless it could be shown to have some useful military value. Ther eis no \"right to hunt\" recognised at the federal level (though a few states do recognise the right).\n \n I have several fully automatic weapons. They are fun to shoot, and they are legal, provided you jump through the proper hoops. THe very reason the NFA was drafted as a tax measure (The NFA is the law that places prohibitions on machine guns, hand grenades, flame throwers, rocket launchers, etc...) was that they knew at the time that an outright ban would be unconstitutional. So, istead, they imposed a large (at the time) tax on these items and required that approval be obtained through the treasury deprtment. The courts have avoided ruling on the constitutionality of the NFA, except briefly in the Miller case, where the Supreme court strongly implied that had the weapon been a machine gun (the military useage of such a weapon being widely understood) Miler would have likely been acquited on the grounds that the NFA is uncostitutional. \n \n Just recently a federal appeals court has ruled that congress exceded its powers by requiring a tax on a machine gun which is never sold in the course of interstate commerce.\n \n We do most definatly and absolutly have the right in America to own a machine gun, a case of hand grenades, an RPG, or a flamethrower if we so desire. There is currently an unconstitutional tax attached to the posession of such weapons, but you still have the right to own one. \n \n I, for one, believe in America and believe in our constitution. I believe the bill of rights grants no rights, it simply recognises pre existing rights that all people posess simply by the fact they are born. AS you have the right to free speech, and the right to breathe the air, you hav an absolut right to own an RPG-7 with armor piercing rounds and a kalishnikof squd support heavy machine gun if you so desire.\n \n Seizing weapons and supporting legislation banning them is un-American.",

I probably sound like a never ending commercial when I speak it. \n \n If you ever get the chance, I would highly recommend traveling through the middle east and Africa. It is an entirely differnt kind of experince than going to europe, or even asia (never really been fond of asia). They have their bandits and criminals like anywhere else, but overall Arabs and African might possibly be the most civilized uncivilized people on the planet. They tend to be VERY polite and respectful of others.
