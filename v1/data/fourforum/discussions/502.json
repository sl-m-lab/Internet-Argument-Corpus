   "WOW! 78 arguments! That's a lot more than Zeus Theobald was able to come up with. However, even though Dr. Theobald has granted premission to copy his pages in total for non-profit personal or educational use, I'm just going to post a link. The actual document in PDF format would run 212 pages if you printed it out. You can find the HTML version at 29+ Evidences for Macroevolution.\n \n However, for anyone who would like to print it out in order to carry it with them so that they might learn what biologists think, the PDF version can be found at http://www.talkorigins.org/pdf/comdesc.pdf.\n \n After reading Dr. Theobald's pages, I also recommend that you read the critique by Ashby Camp (be honest - you have to read the original before the critique). It runs 90 pages (if printed), much of it consists of direct quotes of Dr. Theobald's pages. Then read Dr. Theobald's response. The links are on the first page. It begins on page 120 of the PDF document. And then Camp has responded to the response - 27 more pages. I haven't read it yet.",
