   "modern prison, is a sham, and many people in prison, whould not be there.\n \n And if they deserve to be there, they should not be so confortable.\n \n \n period...\n \n -----from my web site...\n \n \n Freedom vs Civil Liberties : \n \n In 1933, they literally took away constitutional freedom and rights and protections, and gave the people something else, called Civil Liberties, which is granted at the pleasure of the Federal Government, and slowly over the past 80 years, they have created more and more laws, statute laws which the people are forced to obey, 66 million laws and counting, ALL OF WHICH IS UN-CONSTITUTIONAL.\n \n THEY took away the protection of the common law legal system, as provided for in the Constitution, and forced all the people into 14th amendment corporate status, without our informed knowledge, so that they may enforce endless laws on us, most especially taxation, under penalty of prison, which is something they simply could not do in a constitutional common law court. We got ripped off, and enslaved.\n \n \n \n \n Proposals for Freedom vs Civil Liberties : \n \n When the Constitution is restored as law, the common law legal system also gets restored, and as such, the people regain freedom by ending the mandatory 14th amendment Federal citizenship forced on the people in 1933. As under the common law, people are sovereign free people (State citizens), who are free to do as they please, go where they please, posess what they please, so long as they do no harm, do not endanger others, and do not damage any property or otherwise infringe on the freedom of other free people.\n \n THAT WAS FREEDOM, and under the common law, the only REAL CRIMES, are rape, murder, thieft, assault, liable, and the doing of harm in some way to people or property, or the infringement of the rights and freedoms of others, and the punishment for violations of the common law, was hard labor, or in the case of rapists, execution, or life in prison.\n \n Under the common law, THERE IS NO REVOLVING DOOR PRISON SYSTEM... that door is closed, and with real punishment as a real deterrent, criminals know better than to continue to commit crimes, because they will not be getting to watch TV, or have decent foods, or the ability to sit around and socialize. No.. they all get hard labor, and must literally work to repay their debt to society, with labor. (The ACLU was created in 1933, to protect criminals.)\n \n And perhaps as important as anything is the idea that when the court provides an attorney to defend a suspect, that Attorney must be paid an amount comprable to the Prosecuter, and those attorneys must focus on the defence of their clients, and be limited in how many cases they can take on at any given time, and must be mandated to serve their clients, instead of rushing them through as quickly as possible, so as to make the most money by doing so, as this has resulted in bad defence efforts for the people over the past 40 years and it must stop, and attorneys who do not defend their clients, but instead work with prosecuters to force a deal and plea, should themselves be prosecuted for neglecting the purpose of their position, as defence attorneys. \n THE ENTIRE STATUTE LEGAL SYSTEM.. was an experiment started in 1933, and forced on the people, and it is inherently un-constitutional, it robs the people of constitutional freedom, and is the greatest evidence we have for the oppressiveness of our government at this time. It must end, and common law freedom restored. \n \n \n Good people should be free, and bad people should actually be punished. \n \n ( the common law says..... NO HARM = NO FOUL )\n ( HARM = violence, thieft, rape, murder, etc....)\n \n \n \n In 1933, FDR forced all Americans into Federal citizenship, which gives the Federal Government the power to impose any laws as statutes that they see fit, over the people, and they did so, so as to enforce taxation, and over the past 80 years, have robbed us all of every shred of freedom the American people once had, by raising the children of America to think that the existing statute court system, is constitutional, WHEN IN FACT, IT IS NOT. \n IT IS A SHAM.. a crime against freedom, and they have used it to fill the prisons with literally millions of people, who under the Constitution should never of been arrested in the first place, all of which, HAS NOT MADE US SAFER, since they reduced the punishment for REAL CRIMINALS, in exchange for the power to make endless laws.\n It was a rip off! A Bad Deal, which only benefits criminals! \n \n It was an experiment in law, started in 1933... a sham... and it doesnt work.\n \n THE ACLU AND CIVIL LIBERTIES WERE CREATED IN 1933!! \n TO REPLACE OUR REAL CONSTITUTIONAL FREEDOM!! \n (Which they took away!!!)\n \n \n \n THAT IS A FACT! \n \n We want our freedom back!\n \n ( Constitutional freedom, NOT ACLU civil liberties ) \n \n And we want the ACLU dissolved, and the common law justice of the Constitution restored, which will CLOSE the REVOLVING DOOR PRISONS for good, by providing real punishment for real crimes, as a real deterrent.\n \n \n \n \n The Constitution must be restored as law, and with it, FREEDOM.\n \n \n -Mosheh Thezion :xbanghead",
