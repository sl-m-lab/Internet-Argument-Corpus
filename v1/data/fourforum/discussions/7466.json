He weakened the military, abandoned the US' long-term ally, the Shah and wound up allowing Fundamentalist invade American soil without declaring war on the aggressors. As a result of his weakness, the Shah lost control of Iran, Fundamentalist Islam spread and we lost an Ally in Iran.\n Reagan immediately got the hostages released because they feared the consequences of tangling with a strong US President. The same can be said for the USSR. They feared Reagan enough to increase their military spending beyond their abilities to sustain it. Coupled with the loss of credibility of the gov't over lies told about their mission in Afghanistan and the huge casualties incurred there and the USSR fell.\n Under Reagan, tax rates were cut but tax revenues soared as the American economy came back from the Carter Years. Unfortunately, the Democratic Congress outspent the increased revenuse and we wound up going into debt.",

Way to go reagan.\n\n \n Well, you know what they say about opinions. :) \n \n Here's the Summary from Congress' Joint Economic Committee report in 1995.\n \n Summary\n With four years of data on the current economic recovery (extending back to the Bush Administration), it is now possible to tally up the scorecard and compare the Bush/Clinton recovery that started in 1991 with the Reagan recovery that began in 1982.[1] President Clinton has boasted that his policies have spurred economic growth, added jobs, and helped the middle class. However, the data show that the Bush/Clinton recovery is weak compared to the Reagan recovery along several important measures. Both economic growth and job creation in the current recovery lag behind the Reagan recovery by two full years. The middle class is suffering an actual loss in real median family income, while during the Reagan recovery it gained. Moreover, tax revenues increased more rapidly under Reagan's tax cuts than under the Bush/Clinton tax increases. \n \n The most outstanding policy differences between the two recoveries are in the realm of tax policy. Reagan instituted across-the-board reductions in tax rates, while Bush and Clinton both pushed massive tax increases. The most disturbing conclusion is that the 1990 and 1993 tax increases have cost Americans far more than the extra earnings collected by the IRS; they have cost the economy at least two years of growth. Comparing the two recoveries: \n \n Real GDP grew more in five years under Reagan (23 percent cumulative growth) than it is projected to grow in seven years under Bush/Clinton (21 percent cumulative growth). \n \n After four years, 4 million more jobs were created under Reagan than under Bush/Clinton. \n \n Federal revenues, adjusted for inflation, grew much faster under Reagan (33 percent cumulative growth) than projected under Bush/Clinton (20 percent cumulative growth). \n \n Real per capita disposable income grew more in two years under Reagan than in all four years combined thus far in the Bush/Clinton recovery (8.2 percent versus 7.8 percent). \n \n Median family income grew in all of the first three recovery years under Reagan, compared to three consecutive declines under Bush/Clinton. \n In other words, during the economic expansion following Reagan's tax cuts, the economy grew faster, experienced stronger revenue growth, created more jobs, and saw more rapid income growth than the current expansion under the high tax policies of Presidents Bush and Clinton. http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/taxpol/taxpol.htm",

   "Real GDP grew more in five years under Reagan (23 percent cumulative growth) than it is projected to grow in seven years under Bush/Clinton (21 percent cumulative growth). \n\n \n Far MORE than offset by debt and debt service\n \n \nAfter four years, 4 million more jobs were created under Reagan than under Bush/Clinton. \n\n \n And yet the number of people living below the poverty level INCREASED by 9%\n \n \nFederal revenues, adjusted for inflation, grew much faster under Reagan (33 percent cumulative growth) than projected under Bush/Clinton (20 percent cumulative growth). \n\n \n I am not sure where you got this, but it seems unlikely due to the fact that deficits ballooned and government spending decreased by .8% during the Reagan years. \n \n \nReal per capita disposable income grew more in two years under Reagan than in all four years combined thus far in the Bush/Clinton recovery (8.2 percent versus 7.8 percent). \n\n \n And, again, the number of people living under the poverty level increased, and consumer spending and savings both DECREASED. This was the problem with Reaganomics. His trickle down theories and supply side voodoo provided massive increases in income, etc.. for the top 10-15% of Americans and drive the rest of the country into the poor house. The economic problems during Bushs presidency were a DIRECT result of Reaganomics.\n \n Milton Firedmann was one of the architects of REaganomics and even he has said the concepts were essentially fraudulent. What Reagan essentially did was pushed the problem beyond his presidency (just like Bush did, and just like Clinton did). The alst thing the guy deserves is any kind of medal for this.\n \n I like what Reagan did with corporate income taxes, though he probably should have stuck to his guns and eliminated it. The problem is that ghe went WAY overboard with corporate welfare, which basically allowed unproductive and uncomptitive businesses stay in business without making the difficult changes that needed to be made.",
