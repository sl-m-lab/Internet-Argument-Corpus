   "http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080825/ap_on_el_pr/cvn_democrats_faith\n Democrats open faith-filled convention with prayer\n \n DENVER - At the first official event Sunday of the Democratic National Convention, a choir belted out a gospel song and was followed by a rabbi reciting a Torah reading about forgiveness and the future.\n \n Helen Prejean, the Catholic nun who wrote \"Dead Man Walking,\" assailed the death penalty and the use of torture.\n \n Young Muslim women in headscarves sat near older African-American women in their finest Sunday hats.\n \n Four years ago, such a scene would have been unthinkable at a Democratic National Convention. In 2004, there was one interfaith lunch at the Democratic gala in Boston.\n \n But that same year, \"values voters\" helped re-elect President Bush, giving Democrats of faith the opening they needed to make party leaders listen to them.\n \n The result was on display at Sunday's interfaith service, staged in a theater inside the Colorado Convention Center, and will be evident throughout the convention agenda and on the sidelines.\n What do anti-theists think about this? I can't help but wonder what those who prefer secularism think about all this religion at opening of the convention.\n \n Where are all the calls for religion to stay out of politics, here? Why don't we hear the critics when Obama talks about his religion the way we heard them when Bush used to do so?",

If the religious left is going to get to make religion a catalyst without criticism as is happening here, then the religious right should be able to as well. (And no, I'm NOT talking about creating laws here; I'm talking about religion in POLITICS.) What I think is striking here is that the article indicates that religion is clearly being made an emphasis at this convention so far. I wonder if we'll be hearing the democrats being called \"sheeple\" and the same level of criticism over it. Some people make it clear they don't like it when religion and politics are mixed. Well, THIS is an example.",

Why should the radicals be concerned about political positioning which is all he is about? It's true spiritual commitment and moral convictions that make the blood of the loony lefty's run cold with fear and apprehension.",
