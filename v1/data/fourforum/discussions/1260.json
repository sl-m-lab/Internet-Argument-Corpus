   "Hello, I'm new to the forums. I am still a student in school and I have a pussasive essay to do for my English portfolio.\n\n Welcome. You don't say where you are a \"student in school.\" I was a \"student in school\" in my late 20's, not because I a dumb, but because I served in the Army and then taught for several years before undertaking graduate studies.\n \nOne of the topics I would like to do is weather or not the 10 commandments should be posted in public areas (i.e. schools and court houses). I was talking to me English teacher about this topic, and his two main points where that nobody is forcing people to read or look at the public display and most of the laws are based off the commandments.\n\n Well, your teacher is wrong.\n \n First, let's take the \"laws are based off (on) the commandments.\" There are actually at least two versions of the \"10 Commandments,\" probably more. Except for \"thou shalt not kill\" and \"thou shalt not steal\", what laws are there that echo the ten commandments? Possibly you could present a case that \"thou shalt not bear false witness\" is the basis of perjury laws. But what law declares that \"I am the Lord thy God?\" What law makes it illegal to covet my neighbor's wife? Where is it a criminal offense to commit adultry? There are only two, at best three commandments that are incorporated into law. And if these commandments are really the basis of our laws, then wouldn't it be reasonable the assume that cultures that had never heard of the ten commandments wouldn't have such laws? But if you look into the matter you will find that laws against murder, theft, and even lying to legal authorities are almost universal. These are recognized conventions of an orderly society.\n \n The matter of \"nobody is forcing people to read or look at the public display\" is a bit more subtle. In effect, the answer is, \"So what? It is still a violation of the Constitution.\" The posting of religious monuments by the government are almost always violations of the 1st Amendment (as incorporated against the states by the 14th Amendment). Here's why. The Supreme Court (whose sole job is to decide the meaning of the Constitution) has found on several occasions that the purpose of the establishment clause of the 1st Amendment is to prevent government from endorsing or supporting religion. Unless one can support the ridiculous assertion that the ten commandments are not religious, then their posting in government buildings of any kind are a violation of the Constitution.\n \n An additional point. Those who agree with the posting of religious icons are required to make no acknowledgement of that agreement. Thus, the actions of those who disagree are indistinguishable from those who agree. The Supreme Court has found that such cases are violations of the 1st Amendment. This was the basis of decisions against the \"stand and be silent while the teacher recites a (christian) prayer\" laws. Participation and non-participation were the same. Even laws that excused objectors have been found unconstitutional because they single out dissenters for persecution.\n \n Government approval of religion in general, and especially any particular religion, are unconstitutional.\n \nHe may feel that his points have merit, but under the principles of Constitutional law.\n\n I don't mean to nit-pick, but that's an incomplete sentence. So let me complete the thought. Under the principles of Constitutional law he is wrong, dead wrong.\n \nI am having a little trouble with my essay...the points I have so far are:\n \n Con\n - The teaching of morals should not be taken in the hands of the school, it should rather be taught by the parents of the children or their own lives ( morals can be derived on their religion without infringement of exposing people to religions that are not their own).\n\n Yes. It is not the responsibility of the government to teach your religion to your children. I have bee told that there are more than 1000 christian sects. Should we make it the responsibility of the public schools to teach ean of these? And that doesn't even consider the non-christian religions.\n \n- The Bill of Right's purpose is to protect the minority thus posting the 10 commandments would nullify the effect of the Bill of Rights.\n\n Correct. It imposes a specific set of religions (judeo-christian) as the \"official\" approved religion of the state. The state may neither endorse nor suport religion.\n \n- Posting the exact commandments will influence or instigate religion, such as the first four commandments (this is where my English teacher said, \"What if they are Buddhist\" and \"They do not have to look at the public display\").\n\n Of course, the posting of the judeo-christian commandments approves of a particular set of religions. That is forbidden by a Constitution that forbids government approval of any religion at all. The business of government is government, not religion.\n \n- The first commandment could classify as establishment of religion.\n\n Without doubt.\n \nHelp will be great!\n\n I hope my thoughts helped. But the library will help more.",

   "Although I suspected that the OP was motivated by an interest in the case of Mr. Moore and his monumental erection in the rotunda of the Alabama Supreme Court, I avoided the issue. However, shouldn't it be considered that Mr. Moore has lost at every step? He lost at the District Court level (and was removed from his position for violation of the order of this court), he lost at the Circuit Court level, and the Supreme Court denied cert (refused to consider the case for lack of Constitutional questions - in other words, Mr. Moore violated the 1st Amendment. The District Court decision, as upheld by the U.S. Circuit Court was correct). And now the Alabama Court of the JUdiciary (which has authority \"to remove from office, suspend without pay, or censure a judge, or apply such other sanction as may be prescribed by law, for violation of a Canon of Judicial Ethics, misconduct in office, failure to perform his duties...\") voted 9-0 to remove Mr. Moore from office. The Court of the Judiciary is composed of one judge of an appellate court (selected by the Supreme Court of Alabama), two judges of the circuit court (Circuit Judges' Association), one district judge (selected by the District Judges' Association), two members of the state bar (selected by the governing body of the Alabama State Bar), two persons who are not lawyers (appointed by the Governor-subject to Senate confirmation), and one person appointed by the Lieutenant Governor (subject to Senate confirmation). Mr. Moore could not have been removed unless the vote was unanimous.\n \n There is no question that Mr. Moore violated the 1st Amendment.",

I am having a little trouble with my essay...the points I have so far are:\n Help will be great!\n\n \n The idea of 'love thy neighbour' as stated by Jesus Christ is a guiding principle in even modern laws.\n \n The law of Torts* stems from the decision of Lord Aitken in Donoghue v Stevenson (1932)\n \n Lord Aitken said... \"The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the lawyer's question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omission which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who then, in law, is my neighbour? The answer seems to be - persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question.\" \n http://www.lawscot.org.uk/whatis/case5.html\n \n \n *which has given us personal negligence laws.\n \n Christian principles permeate modern laws. The fact that most US states operate under common law, which was handed down in part from Britain suggests Christian principles; because Britain too was once quite Christian... The 'English Civil War' which saw the rise of parliament was began in part over religion.\n \n The USA had many Christian colonies at its founding.\n http://www.geocities.com/iconoclastes.geo/constitution.html is an interesting site, because it's trying desperately to deny the Christian influence. For instance it recognises...'March 4, 1629 - The first Charter of Massachusetts read in part:\n \"For the directing, ruling, and disposing of all other Matters and Thinges, whereby our said People may be soe religiously, peaceablie, and civilly governed, as their good life and orderlie Conversacon, maie wynn and incite the Natives of the Country to the Knowledg and Obedience of the onlie true God and Savior of Mankinde, and the Christian Fayth, which in our Royall Intencon, and The Adventurers free profession, is the principall Ende of the Plantacion..\"\n \n But then counters by saying 'Let us now see the legal means the Christians of the Massachusetts Bay Colony enacted only a year later to achieve these goals: In 1630 it was made illegal to: \n \"shoot off a gun on any unnecessary occasion except an Indian or a wolf.\" [SH241]'\n \n So, their argument then is not that there was no Christian influence, just that it was limited.\n \n The Women's Christian Temperance Union wanted laws changed in regards to alcohol. This was achieved in the 1920s; showing that Christian pressure groups could influence law-makers along Christian lines. This influence of Christians is still being exerted on law.\n \n Your calendar, and some public holidays are influenced by the Christian world; so your whole fabric of nation is yearly influenced by Christianity.",

I am having a little trouble with my essay...the points I have so far are:[QUOTE]\n \n \n First and foremost, I would like topoint out that the problem is not with them being posted in public areas... the problem is with them being posted on state or federal property ( which includes courthouses, schools, parks, etc) This undermines the constitutionally based separation of church and state. You are perfectly welcome to place the commandments in say... a convention center, church, or hotel. McDonald's could put them up if they wanted to.\n Your teacher telling you that most laws are based off the ten commandments is totally wrong. Compare the commandments to the bill of rights and you will see this. The constution states that you have religious freedom, you are free to pursue and practice any religion (or none) of your choice. One of the commandments (not sure which one) tells you not to \"hold any god before me\".\n Clinton's problem was not that he committed adultery, it was that he committed perjury. He lied about it.If he had stood up and proudly proclaimed that he had slept with the entire female population of Arkansas, he would have never gotten in trouble.\n The commandments tell you not to bear false witness against your neighbor, but we all see that everyday in the tabloids at the checkout aisle. \n These are only some of the contradictions between the two sets of rules. I'm sure you can come up with more.\n Why should there be a separation of church and state? Easy...Why should one man, woman, or child be forced to say and do things that they might disagree with, but that are in direct contravention of their own religion. For a buddhist child who does not believe in a god to be forced to pledge allegiance to \"one nation under god\" is wrong. For one child to tour his state capitol and see one religion's beliefs posted in granite splendor is wrong. If that child wants to learn about the world's religions- there are places he can go to for that, the state capitol should not be that place.\n The constitution of the united states puts forth the idea that all citizens are equal. The closest thing to equality they could strive for would be to put teachings from all religions right up there next to the commandments.... and what a jumbled monument that would be.",

That's right, you can't you just said that they were all destroyed. In that case how do you know that they come from pagan laws? Your circular reasoning is now bogged down.\n \n Your attempts to have two mutually exclusive arguments doesn't work.\n \n On one hand you're suggesting that pagan culture was virtually wiped out by Christians, therefore you can't tell me which pagan source he was relying on.\n \n On the other hand, that despite your first assertion, you are sure that he is in fact basing his decision on pagan principles, even though you don't know which ones.\n \n \nFirst you want to defend the issue; the source of his findings, then within the space of one paragraph, you say it's irrelevant. Stick to an argument, please.\n\n \n \nI am, you're the one who is trying to confuse the issue.\n\n \n No, you are confused. Simply saying you're not and showing you are doesn't help.\n \n \n I know that the notion that Lord Aitken was a Christian and that Christian principles were guiding him might annoy you.\n\n \n \nThat maybe, but for one thing, who is Lord Aitken? My point is that the so-called \"Christian Principles\" are not even truly Christian to begin with.\n\n \n This is probably the most glaring evidence that you can't understand an argument. Lord Aitken made the pronouncement in the case I'm arguing; the one that lead to torts law. That you don't even know who he is, but earlier insisted that he wasn't basing his decisions on Christian principles is truly an amazing feat!:)\n \n I mentioned him in my earlier post. He was the leading law lord in the decision Donaghue v Stevenson. That you've not bothered to even research this (for all you know I could be making the whole thing up), yet you're still engaging me on this subject is bordering hysterical.\n \n \nI made the claim that there is still Christian influence. You responded, but didn't disagree that there was an influence, just that the influence was neither positive, nor persuasive. Now you've forgotten what you were arguing, and reverted to the original poster's claims. Who are you debating, me or him? I'm not sure you know.\n\n \n \nThere is no such thing as Christian Principles. Very little, if anything, is actually original to it.\n\n \n Having originality is beside the point. It's like me now saying that you don't have any principles because all your ideas come from someone else.\n \n There are Christian Principles. They are, quite frankly, the principles that Christians believe in. IF you're now trying to argue that there aren't, then you've completely gone against your anti-Christian polemic on the debate on Islam, where you were blaming Christians for all sorts of evils. Now you're saying that they weren't based on 'Christian's principles, but earlier pagan ones. So, the hatred against the Jews; that was the pagans fault! (According to you now).\n \n \nWhich laws are you citing re: Australia? You didn't even know we are a Constitutional Monarchy .\n\n \n \nYou don't. According to the 2002 CIA World Factbook you have a democratic, federal-state system recognizing the British monarch as sovereign. Plus, isn't there a movement on now to separate from the Commonwealth as well? Is your Prime Minister your monarch? \n\n \n Yes, on another post I said you were quoting the CIA World Factbook. Pity you went on to argue against me there, because you show you didn't read it.\n \n We are a federal democratic state. We are a constitutional monarchy.\n Canada is a federal democratic state (sometimes called a confederation). It is a constitutional monarchy\n The USA is a federal democratic state. It is a constitutional republic.\n \n You are the one who said we are not a constitutional monarchy. I showed you evidence to refute that. Instead you refer to the CIA fact book. The CIA fact book is correct. What I cited is correct. You don't understand that a) you are wrong because b) they are not mutually exclusive.\n \n Your comment has demonstrated\n a) you don't know about Australia's system of government (or you'd not ask is our PM our monarch - is yours? No of course not)\n b) you don't understand what a constitutional monarchy is\n c) you don't even understand about your own countries government\n \n and yet you're quite happy to argue against me on this issue:)\n \n And no, there isn't a movement to separate from the Commonwealth. There is a move to become a republic. These two are different things. We can remain within the Commonwealth and be a republic, even though the head of the Commonwealth is the Queen.\n \n \nAre you referring to s.116. of our Federal Constitution...?\n \"The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.\"\n Obviously you don't believe in taking time to respond, and actually researching what you're debating. Why clutter your comment with facts?\n\n \n \nI was speaking of the USA. You sound just like an American that I forget that you aren't \n\n \n No, you said\n \nIrrelevant. I never claimed any different with our law. We don't have a law restricting the government from eastablishment (sic) of religion, you do.\n\n \n Again you don't know what you say.:) And you don't admit when you make mistakes. I guess if you did, saying mea culpa would take up 90% of your posts.\n \n \n So you've reversed yet again, and now recognise that there is a sizeable group of Christians in each - suppose now you're saying that they have no influence.\n\n \n \nWrong. I didn't say anything of the sort. You're just twisting words again. I had said when it comes to their Christians. Read the entire post before making such replies.\n\n \n Yes, you are going against what you said. You were denying that Christians had no influence.

You're the one who is jumpping (sic) around in an effort to confuse the issue.\n\n \n Again, you show\n a) no humilty\n b) no insight\n in saying that.

   "....no hate....but this: \n The 10 Commandments represent the laws as obeyed by the first Christians.\n \n \"If America is a Christian country then the 10 Commandments have a place.\"\n does not look like a question to me. However, I do admit that it was a bit of a knee-jerk reaction on my part.\n\n \n I am sorry too for my anger. Yes it was a rhetorical question.\n \n Did you look to the earlier posts re: Torts Law.\n \n The whole law stream that allows you to sue the company of a faulty toy comes from the Christian, Lord Aitken, asking \"Who then is my neighbour?\"\n \n Because Jesus taught us to love our neighbour. Lord Aitken asked to show that there was a duty of care from the manufacturer to anyone who might buy their products, regardless if they were not directly sold.\n \n It is an interesting case. It started when a woman drank from a bottle in a restaurant. The bottle was opaque (she couldn't see the contents) and she discovered a half dissolved snail. She took the manufacturer to court. But up till then she could have only been covered by contract law, and as she had bought it from the restaurant who had in turn bought it from the manufacturer, some said she had no case. It was a landmark decision. It allowed for parties injured to seek compensation where no contract exists.\n \n Thus, I have no contract with my local government, but if they build a faulty footpath, and I break my leg, I have recourse to compensation through a Tort action.\n \n Although this debate is specifically about the 10 Commandments, I hoped by showing that Christian principles still influence the law (in the issue of Torts; greatly), then the 10 Commandments, as a symbol of what Christains believe still has a place.\n \n I don't know about the actual legalities of placing such a symbol in the court. That is, what it is, a symbol of the Judeo-Christian law system.",

   "You are saying that there is a consensus about anything within the chuch, which is a laughable idea.\n \n\n \n No, what I'm saying is that the Old Testament contains a corpus of law.\n \n One of them is \"Thou shall not kill\"\n \n You take it on a strictly literal sense - not killing anything.\n \n But in the context of the laws - it can't be because other laws deal with what can be slaughtered for sacrifice, what can be killed and eaten, etc. You must either argue that these laws are in conflict with the 10 Commandments, or that your interpreation of one of these laws is wrong.\n \n The Jews didn't have any problems with the laws in so far as they understood what was meant.",

   "The alleged legal basis for removing all of these Ten Commandments monuments is the establishment clause of the First Amendment. That clause provides: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The vigilant observer will note instantly that none of the monuments cases involves Congress, a law or an establishment of religion. \n \n Monuments are not \"laws,\" the Plattsmouth, Neb., public park is not \"Congress,\" and the Ten Commandments are not a religion. To the contrary, all three major religions believe in Moses and the Ten Commandments.",
