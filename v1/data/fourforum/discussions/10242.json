   ". . . \"There's a well-documented motherhood penalty: women with children are paid less than women without children,\" controlling for other factors, said Mary Blair-Loy, a sociologist and author of \"Competing Devotions,\" a study of executive women who kept working versus ones who discontinued their careers.\n \n Fathers, however, are not similarly disadvantaged and might even benefit at the workplace from being parents, according to more than one study, including one published in March in The American Journal of Sociology.\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/11/business/11envy.html",

Its not about wome being paid less because of pregnancy leaves and what not (something both parents are now entitled to by LAW by the way).\n \n Its about how working women still have to manage most if not all of the home-making and men don't and how that impacts what they are able to put into work and to put into net-working outside of work. Men, as rule do much less at home, and have home support even if their wife works.\n \n Bassman - you are way off the mark with your comment.",

   "Well, it's all balanced out with the bias men recieve in custody and child raising issues.\n Society typically takes a favorable view towards mothers and against fathers.\n \n Over the past 2 years, I and the wife have had a lot of Jerry Springer nonsense caused by her that's well documented. We currently live apart but spend time together.\n \n Over this time, I got legal custody of the youngest, 10 years old son. No other custody orders were issued. Oldest son is married and gone. Teen age Daughters live with mother (free to run).\n \n Let me tell you of the numerous difficulties I have when dealing with any authority figure not involved in the case.\n Having to explain that the son lives with me with a custody order, that his mother doesn't see him that often and has little impact in his life and that natural assumptions made are totally wrong is pretty pathetic.\n Stating over and over that several counselors have found the youngest to be the most well balanced and free from brain washing and that it's not only his desire to live with me but I was deemed best suited to care for him to the many minor people is tedious. Having to whip out a copy of the custody order at times is beyond annoying. \n I just had to deal with a nonsensical CPS man 2 days ago because some peon officer had a grudge and too much testosterone.\n I guess it doesn't pay to explain to XXXXXX that if they have a problem, they should take it up with their superiors (police captains and judges) who are already aware of the issue.\n \n Then there's the inbuilt bias that simply believes a father isn't the best one to nurture children.\n \n On top of this...I live in a 'father friendly state'. emoticon_rolleyes",
