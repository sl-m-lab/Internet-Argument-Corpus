   "Click Here To See The Picture\n \n NOTE--< I've included ALL the bible refernces at the end of this post\n \n Why Don't The Apostles Fast?\n \n That's the question that followers of John The Baptist asked Christ. They were also quick to point out the fact that both Pharisees and them fasted often. So why is it that the apostles DON'T FAST (Matthew 9:14)?\n \n Christ's answer is misleading. He said, \"Do you expect the guests at a wedding reception to be sad as long as the bridegroom is with them (Matthew 9:15)?\" It almost sounds like he was making up an excuse for them.\n \n Before I address that point lets see what Christ says about praying, fasting and performing religious duties. Once you understand that concept, you'll understand why Christ SIDE-STEPPED the question about why the apostles DON'T FAST. \n \n When Christ talked about praying, fasting and performing religious duties, he said DO NOT do them in public. DO NOT make a BIG SHOW of it. If you do, you WON'T be rewarded by your FATHER in heaven for those deeds. You will have already been reward for them (Matthew 6:1-2). He went on to say, when you do your religious duties, do them in such a way as to keep it a secret from your closest friends (Matthew 6:3-4) \n \n Later, he restated those SAME PRINCIPLES when he talked about fasting. He said, DO NOT put on a sad face; DO NOT neglect your appearance and DO NOT let others know you are fasting or you will have already received your reward in full. Instead, do so in a way that no one knows. So your FATHER in heaven who see everything will reward you (Matthew 6:16-18). \n \n Now lets go back to the initial question. Why DON'T The Apostles Fast? Remember, I said Christ SIDE-STEPPED the question. He was really practicing what he preached or should I say leading by example. By SIDE-STEPPING the question he Kept the fact that the apostles and him sacrificed and fasted often a secret between them and the FATHER.\n \n If you want proof that the apostles sacrificed all you have to do is read the scripture verses that talked about the day Christ selected them. Peter, Andrew, James and John were all fishing with their family when Christ called them. They immediately, gave up everything and followed Christ (Matthew 4:18-22). So they had NO earthly possessions and they began their life of sacrifice. To give you a better idea what the apostles gave up or should I say the sacrifices they made for GOD lets look at those that wouldn't make the required sacrifices. They wanted to have the freedom to take time off to say good-bye to their family or bury a father (Luke 9:59-61). The FIRST of many sacrifices they would be required to make if they wanted to be a follower of Christ. Unfortunately, those sacrifices were more than they were willing to make. The Apostles however made those types of sacrifices ALL the time.\n \n I know those references DON'T mention fasting per say. But with little or no money, you have to know they had times when they had little or no food for several days at a time. Now you know why Christ said, \"Do you expect the guests at a wedding reception to be sad as long as the bridegroom is with them?\" The chances for the Christ and the apostles to enjoy themselves were few and far between. So when GOD gave them an opportunity to have a good time they didn't have to fast. It just might have been GOD'S way of getting them the rest and nourishment they would need to complete the next phase of Christ's mission.\n \n Christ also told us how much he and his followers had to do without when he said, \"Foxes have holes, and birds have nests but the Son of Man has no place to lie down and rest (Luke 9:58). That statement documents just how poor Christ was. It was his way of telling those that wanted to be his followers that they would be asked to do a lot more than fast. They would have to give up the luxury of a roof over their heads. There is NO DOUBT in my mind that Christ and the apostles missed many meals do to their lack of funds and the remoteness of the area while they traveled from place to place.\n \n In conclusion, FASTING and SACRIFICE is NOT suppose to be something followers of Christ do a couple of times a year. It's something they do DAILY but ONLY THE FATHER KNOWS. Christ and the apostles pushed themselves to the limit of their physical endurance almost everyday. Asking them to sacrifice even more would be foolish but Christ DIDN'T tell anyone that because he wanted his reward in heaven. Thus he SIDE-STEPPED the question. Now you know the HIDDEN SECRET. Christ and the apostles let GOD decide when they needed to fast and when they should enjoy themselves.\n \n Christ once said, \"Look at the birds: they do not plant seeds, gather a harvest and put it in barns; yet your FATHER in heaven takes care of them! Aren't you worth more than birds? (Matthew 6:26)\" By letting GOD decide when he and the apostles needed to fast and sacrifice, Christ was once again practicing what he preached. They had nothing but what FATHER provided. So if they had food they ate. If they had none, they fasted. Moses and the Israelites had a similar experience in the desert after they left Egypt. GOD provided the food and water when they needed it.\n \n So the question is: Would you give up everything if Christ asked you to be one of his disciples (actually, he did when he said take up your cross and follow me)? If you want to say YES, then start practicing what Christ preached and your heavenly reward will be great. If you want to say NO then fasting twice a year is a GOOD START. Hopefully, in time you will work up to being a follower of Christ. Then fasting and sacrifice will be a DAILY routine for you too and you WON'T have to schedule it twice a year.\n \n Now you know the HIDDEN MESSAGE behind the question: Why DON'T The Apostles Fast? And Christ's answer: \"Do you expect the guests at a wedding reception to be sad as long as the bridegroom is with them?\" They fasted all the time but they kept it a secret between them and the FATHER because they wanted their reward in heaven NOT here on earth.\n \n Matthew 9:14 (Christ asked about fasting)\n 14 Then John's disciples came and asked him, \"How is it that we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?\"\n Matthew 9:15 (Wedding guests are NOT suppose to be sad)\n 15 Jesus answered, \"How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast. \n Matthew 6:1-2 (Don't do you religious duties in public)\n 1 \"Make certain you do not perform your religious duties in public so that people will see what you do. If you do these things publicly, you will not have any reward from your Father in heaven. 2 So when you give something to a needy person, do not make a big deal of it, as the hypocrites do in the houses of worship and on the streets. They do it so that people will praise them. I assure you, they have already been paid in full.\"\n Matthew 6:3-4 (Keep your religious duties between your FATHER and you)\n 3 But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4 so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.\n Matthew 6:16-18 (Hide your fasting so your FATHER will reward you)\n 16 \"When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. 17 But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, 18 so that it will not be obvious to men that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen will know. ANd your Father, who sees what you do in secret, will reward you.\n Matthew 4:18-22 (Peter, Andrew, James And John started Sacrificing)\n 18 As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. 19 \"Come, follow me,\" Jesus said, \"and I will make you fishers of men.\" 20 At once they left their nets and followed him. 21 Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them, 22 and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.\n Luke 9:58 (Chrst didn't even have a roof over his head)\n 58 Jesus replied, \"Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.\"\n Luke 9:59-62 (Sacrifices required to be a follower of Christ)\n 59 He said to another man, \"Follow me.\" But the man replied, \"Lord, first let me go and bury my father.\" 60 Jesus said to him, \"Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.\" 61 Still another said, \"I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say good-by to my family.\" 62 Jesus replied, \"No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.\"\n Matthew 6:26 (Christ let GOD take care of him and the apostles)\n 26 Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?",
