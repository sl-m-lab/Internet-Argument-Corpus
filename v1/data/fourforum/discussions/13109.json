It can also mean \"sunset,\" \"night,\" or \"ending of the day.\" The Hebrew word translated morning is boger. It can mean \"sunrise\" or \"beginning of day,\" and has been used in theology in a metaphoric sense. The evening and morning of the creation days then refer not simply to the rising and setting of the sun, but to the beginning and ending boundaries of a day. Again, in context with the remainder of the creation days, Moses' day of Genesis 2:4 is longer than a 24 hour period. How much longer is highly unknown, considering a day can also mean a thousand years in God's eyes, as other scriptures attest, or longer (see below).\n \n You have even more problems, assuming you want to stick with Biblical concepts of a \"day\": \n \n There is one \"day\" for which the description \"evening and morning\" is absent, which is the seventh \"day.\" This seventh day is seen twice in Genesis - in Genesis 2:2 and 2:3. And in both cases there is no description of \"evening or morning.\"\n \n Hebrews chapter 4 also speaks of this \"seventh day\" and states, \"Another word for the \"seventh day\" is \"today\" (4:7). Obviously, then, the seventh day is another long age of time which continues to this day, since we have not all rested in our \"Sabbath rest\".\n \n Light and darkness, then, in a creation day, must be construed as the dawning and twilight of one day of creation, which obviously must be extended ages of time.\n \n What's more, On the third day, God formed the land out of the seas. There is no time frame given for the formation of the land and seas. Some time after the land was formed, God created the plants:\n \n Then God said, \"Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with seed in them, on the earth\"; and it was so. (Genesis 1:11)\n And the earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with seed in them, after their kind; and God saw that it was good. (Genesis 1:12)\n \n The text clearly states that the earth \"sprouted\" the plants (the Hebrew word deshe, Strong's #H1877, usually refers to grasses). The Hebrew word dasha, (Strong's #H1876) indicates that the plants grew from either seeds or small seedlings in order to have \"sprouted.\" In addition, these plants produced seeds. The Hebrew word here is zera (Strong's #H2233), which is most often translated \"descendants.\" This makes matters very difficult for the 24-hour interpretation. Not only do the plants sprout and grow to maturity, but produce seed or descendants. There are no plants capable of doing this within a 24-hour period of time. Things actually get worse for this interpretation. Genesis 1:12 clearly states that God allowed the earth to bring forth trees that bore fruit. The process by which the earth brings forth trees to the point of bearing fruit takes several years, at minimum. God did not create the trees already bearing fruit. The text states clearly that He allowed the earth to accomplish the process of fruit bearing through natural means. Because the process of the third day requires a minimum period of time of more than 24 hours, the Genesis text for the third day clearly falsifies the interpretation that the days of Genesis one are 24-hour periods of time.

Like all idioms, its meaning is nonliteral but clearly understood by native speakers. The phrase \"evening and morning\" can, like yom, denote a long and indefinite period. The Old Testament itself unambiguously uses the \"evening and morning\" phrase in just such a way. In Daniel 8 we read the account of Daniel's ram and goat vision and the interpretation given by Gabriel. The vision covers many years; some commentators believe the time has not yet been completed. Daniel 8:26 says, \"The vision of the evenings and the mornings that have been given to you is true, but seal up the vision for it concerns the distant future\" (RSV). In Hebrew manuscripts, \"the evenings and mornings,\" is not in the plural but in the singular, identical to the expression we find in Genesis 1. Translated literally, the verse reads, \"And the vision of the evening and the morning that has been given you\" Here we have a clear indication from scriptural usage that this phrase does not demand a 24-hour-day interpretation and can refer to an indefinite epoch.\n \n How Long an Evening & Morning",

   "Easy, I'm aware that the words \"day\", \"morning\" and \"evening\" COULD be used to metaphorically. Practically any noun in any language can be used metaphorically. However, the point I'm making is that you're assuming that the original authors' intent was to use those words with a metaphorical meaning. You assume that in order for genesis to correspond to the fact that it took millions of years for life to inhabit the earth, the genesis story narators were aware of this when they came up with the story. Not only that, but in order to not mislead the listeners of the story, we must assume that the audience understood in no uncertain terms that creation really didn't take 6 days, even though in the story they made it sound like it did. \n \n In fact, every jew, who by tradition were trained in the scripture of the old testament, would have known of the fact that the earth was created over a period of millions to billions of years. They would have also understood that there really was no orginal week, nor original sacred seventh day. They would have understood that the period between friday sundown and saturday sundown wasn't actually hallowed by God, and that their weekly acting wasn't really following the fourth commandment (also given by Moses), since their was nothing special about that 24 hour period. In fact, since each \"day\" was an indefinite era of time, the sabbath \"day\" of God is by all likelihood going on right now, and may last a few more thousand to millions of years. And being clearly aware of this, any jew, or his son, or daughter, manservant, maidservant, cattle, or the sojourner who is within his gates, who has done any work within the last 6000 years or so has broken the real sabbath, described in plain language in the 4th commandment, and is going to hell. \n and that would include Moses himself, since he obviously knew first hand. \n \n I mean, ask any jew, whether from then or today. I'm sure they will agree that the \"metaphoric seventh day\", which we all know isn't 24 hours or even close, has nothing to do with their observance of the sabbath as they traditionally see it. In fact, if they actually are so ignorant to think that there's a commandment pertaining to the literal seventh day of the literally week, then they've been misinterpreting their own scriptures for thousands of years.

If I wanted to put a golf course, gas station, porn shop or just live there government would say no. If I let the building fall into disrepair or painted it neon yellow government could make me fix it or restore the visual appeal of the location. If the government decides it needs my property it will buy it from me whether I like it or not. Every property has easements where government can access your property when it deems it necessary. You can not yell fire in a movie theater, you can not slander someone you cannot incite criminal acts and you cannot speak of sedition. \n \n If the government prohibited to building of a mosque anywhere that would be a problem, but to restrict building it certain places is a common everyday occurrence. If they wanted to build it in the middle of Central Park or next to the Statue of Liberty the answer would be no.

There is a reason we do this and it isn't discrimination. \n \n The location 2 blocks 600 feet to build a 13 story 100-150 million community center that teaches that it is God's law to violate the civil rights of women, wants to be a community center and prayer space because then it can control access and did I mention the Imam is a Bullshet artist.

   "Correction:\n Words written in books ,attributed to the words of an imaginary Ultimate Authority, have been responsible for the worst of human behavior. I would say that they were specifically written for such a purpose...to gain power and real estate and force control over others and destroy those who refuse to obey.\n Inspiration derived from religion? I can't think of any.\n \n Oh, if only we could experiment, eliminate religion and find out. emoticon_xgood\n \n \n \n 'B' is a complete contradiction of 'A'...and a contradiction of the laws of Nature! :xbanghead\n Humans have the false belief that they are superior to all other forms of life - on Earth and beyond. Religion teaches to 'subdue' nature and control it. In the process, humans are methodically killing all life on Earth, below and above it, too.\n \n If we are the same as the other animals, which I believe we are, then we are to love ALL others as we love ourselves...not just the 'human' type.\n \n You think you are more important than an amino acid, a water molecule or a honey bee? I'd like to see you exist without them. These are the things we should bow down to and worship - not imaginary gods or, men.\n\n \n Communist China, USSR and I believe Cambodia( near enough) eliminated religion.\n \n To be honest I am too tired to answer your other points but I can see your position...emoticon_xgood",

   "Come on Sandy!\n Religion has been an excuse for the worst of human behaviour but it has been the inspiration for the best too.\n If it wasnt for religion humans would find another excuse to subjegate each other.\n At least there is a core principle that humans are Gods creation and therefore obliged to be kind to Gods creations.\n If we are the same as the other animals why should I treat you better than them and vice versa?\n\n This is funny. Religion directly allows humans to justify their inhumanity to each other more than any other reason. Not only that, but in the name of religion the oppressed groups are kept in their oppression, and are told that their oppression is for their own benefit (blessed are the meek, etc).
