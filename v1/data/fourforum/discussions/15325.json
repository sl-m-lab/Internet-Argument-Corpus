   "RealClearPolitics - Video - Ron Paul: Government Should Have Nothing To Do With Marriage\n\n \n I guess I don't understand what the problem is with the government today? Why anyone would want to go back and live by 18th century standards is beyond me. When the country was founded 93% of the population lived on farms and 3% in the cities. In the 21st century 93% of the population lives in cities and 3% on farms. The founders envisioned a country where people lived on farms they could not have imagined the country in the 21st century. The citizen farmer can not exist in the modern 300million person industialized consumer driven economy of the 21st century.\n \n \n The country the founders envisioned could not exist today and you know it. Who want the local religious nutcases to run things or even have more power over my life. I say fully wall off religion from government. Religion is the enemy of gay civil rights. \n \n The problem is that the government does not tax corporations or the wealthy enough. The government does not provide free health care for its citizens. Tax the rich tax the corporations. Corporations should be stripped of person-hood and made to serve the public interest.\n \n Ron Paul is extremely stupid. The only reason we have government regulations is because people could not behave themselves. The FDA, for example, exists because the food people were eating was killing them. The SEC exists because wall street was stealing peoples money. You get rid of government regulations people will suffer at the hands of greedy capitalists.",

   "I see some problems with the libertarian ideal being discussed here, in which there wouldn't be a \"marriage contract\", and the claim it would supposedly lead to equality for same-sex couples.\n \n Marriage was a contract created by a court a long, long, time ago, under British Common-Law tradition. Marriage has also been re-defined by courts in several places, such as Canada and some U.S. states, that use the common-law definition of marriage, to include same-sex couples. How would we go back in time and do away with \"marriage\" as it stands as part of our legal tradition and current practice?\n \n Also, in reality, marriage gives guarantees that simple contracts do not. I could write up a will, leaving things to my spouse. However, that could be contested by greedy relatives. With the strength of marriage, those greedy relations wouldn't have a leg to stand on. What about insurance and surviving spouse benefits? Without equal marriage, discrimination against same-sex spouses is more likely there. What would I need to ensure I can see my spouse in the hospital? How would I get federal tax benefits, as someone else mentioned? It would take much more trouble and very good financial resources for lawyers, in order to make sure you have a strong contract, or series of contracts. A single, powerful, accessible to all, marriage contract, makes things better and easier. \n \n I think what Matt was alluding to earlier, is the fact that government will be intervening ultimately, to ensure the contract is enforced(the police will come for you). Libertarians want this in order to protect their property. I also don't think they have a problem with the notion that those who can afford the best lawyers, get to have their power and property and best personal interests, protected by the system.",

   "Is it not self-evident? The powers for the federal government are directly listed. Even with the expanded powers compared to the Articles it still placed a lot of power on the states. Really the constitution, as opposed to the Articles, gave the power to tax, enforce their own laws above the states, and regulate commerce between states (and it did a few other things). \n \n The basic concept is that 300 million will never agree on anything but at least at the state and local level you may have stronger support for something and more common set of priorities. A good example is the Arizona immigration law. Heavily supported in Arizona but maybe not a great idea or even supported by Massachusetts. People in Massachusetts probably don't understand the lifestyle and problems in Arizona (and visa versa). So if the federal government enacted a law for everyone it would probably make everyone by Arizona mad but if they didn't than Arizona would be mad.\n\n \n Re: the first part, it is not self-evident to me. The constitution greatly expanded Congress (which has the power to create laws) and created 2 more branches. Granted the main problem was that the feds had no money. But it certainly makes sense to address some issues uniformly nation-wide. \n \n I think the Arizona law is a perfect example of why federal power is of benefit. Look, I understand that most issues are of local importance and are best dealt with locally. But not all. \n \n And to get back on topic.

   "I guess I don't understand what the problem is with the government today? Why anyone would want to go back and live by 18th century standards is beyond me. When the country was founded 93% of the population lived on farms and 3% in the cities. In the 21st century 93% of the population lives in cities and 3% on farms. The founders envisioned a country where people lived on farms they could not have imagined the country in the 21st century. The citizen farmer can not exist in the modern 300million person industialized consumer driven economy of the 21st century.\n\n Morality, which is to say respecting people's liberty is not a consequence of demographics, it is a consequence of the human mind.\n \n \nThe country the founders envisioned could not exist today and you know it. Who want the local religious nutcases to run things or even have more power over my life. I say fully wall off religion from government. Religion is the enemy of gay civil rights. \n\n Aristotle couldn't imagine a modern country either, but still his logic remains applicable.\n \n\n The problem is that the government does not tax corporations or the wealthy enough.\n\n The problem is that the government taxes.\n \n The government does not provide free health care for its citizens. \n \nTax the rich tax the corporations.\n\n You haven't the right to take their money.\n \n \nCorporations should be stripped of person-hood and made to serve the public interest.\n\n Corporations are merely a legal device to help people work together, all you would accomplish by their destruction is forcing every company to be controlled by one person.\n \n \nThe only reason we have government regulations is because people could not behave themselves.\n\n The government is made up of people and voted on by people, if people cannot behave themselves nothing can make them behave.\n \n I am sure you would scoff if someone said the only reason god condemned gay sex is because people could not behave themselves.\n \n \nThe FDA, for example, exists because the food people were eating was killing them. The SEC exists because wall street was stealing peoples money. You get rid of government regulations people will suffer at the hands of greedy capitalists\n\n The government is the only organization which can legally steal people's money, regulations exist because people like you have delusions that you are owed something by people who never agreed to pay you.\n \n \nWhat Ron, the articles of confederation, Paul wants is 50 little nations fighting amongst themselves. One state could conclude that all women are slaves, one state could conclude that it will not honor any contracts from other states.\n\n So anti-federalism is a problem because individual states could make unjust laws?\n \n I agree, but I am sure you didn't think about the full consequences of that position.\n \n If it doesn't make sense for individual states to have their own laws why does it make sense for individual nations to have their own laws.\n \n I hear foolishness about how america is imperialist, the basic argument given is along the lines of \"we are arrogant because we think our vision of morality (as expressed by our laws) is correct but another countries isn't\". I say there is one morality universal to all humans and I don't care a hoot about any one's nationalism if it would get in the way of the truth.\n \n \nHe is an idiot. Either one is a citizen of the US or not. A strong federal government provides for its citizens. It tells the states that a citizen of the US is a citizen of the US not of the state. It is self evident that one needs a consistent system of laws that cover US citizens.\n\n It is obvious that one needs a consistent system of laws that cover humans.\n \n \nI am always baffled why libertarians want the rich to live in gated walled communities with private security guards while the homeless die in the streets or the death traps that are their work places.\n\n Those who truly understand the ideal of liberty don't care how people choose to live their lives so long as they are allowed to choose.\n \n \nThe danger lies in people like Ron Paul, who would do away with all laws the protect people, allow corporations to impose slavery upon their workers, and allow wall street and the banks to create 2 classes of people 10 percent super rich and 90% super poor. So what if some child dies in the street at least Ron Paul doesn't have to look at it from his towered gated castle.\n\n What utter propaganda, the true purpose of which is to run interference for the fact that you are trying to justify theft.\n \n \nThen by that same standard I have the right as a business owner to not serve, or provide services to Christians. Teachers would have the right not to teach christian children.\n\n By the standard of liberty you would.\n \n \nA gay Doctor would have the right not to treat a christian if he cam upon an accident.\n\n The doctor may have taken an oath requiring him to treat someone.\n \n \nI would love to do that.

   "It is either by taxes or the guillotine which do you prefer.\n\n Neither, I prefer see anyone who offers a choice between death and slavery as you just did to be destroyed.\n \n \nWhat you fail to understand is that as the middle goes and you create a small class of rich people standing on the large class of poor people revolution happens.\n\n In capitalism the rich cannot have unfair advantage because no one can have unfair advantage. If the distribution of wealth does not reflect it's creation now it is because of the fascist elements which are mutilating the market with regulations. In such an environment people are cheated out of wealth they deserve but not because a private individual took it from them but because regulations deny them that wealth.\n \n When you show me a company that enslaves it's employees or forces it's customers to buy it's products I will show you government regulations which legalize it.\n \n You cannot enslave a man that agrees to work at a certain wage just because their life depends on it. All our lives depend on productive labour, what could be more just than to say that men shall work together when they both agree what that work is worth?\n \n That is the premise of all capitalism. Trade including trading for worktime only occurs when both parties agree what it's worth. If a man is enslaving another merely by the token that the other requires him to live then how much crueler is nature that demands an absolute price for survival?\n \n Why does a factory worker need a big shot CEO? Only because that is the way he chooses to live, if he could have a better life without that factory he can quit; but he doesn't. You now lower your gaze and cough a little, I've seen it a dozen times. You complain that society is oriented now such that he would have to live like a barbarian if he didn't want to work on a modern endeavour.\n \n I ask you this, what right does he have to demand others change their life so that he can live in a different society? I do not say that no other system would work, but I demand that all those involved agree to it. The fact that people make the most money they can means they are doing what is most productive. If their labor was worth more than a factory owner is recognizing they can find another factory owner with a more accurate judgement on the matter. If they can find no such factory then that means that no one with wealth thinks the work is worth more. If such a man confronted by the fact that no one will trade for his labour at the rate he demands, falls prey to the selfish delusion that he is right while they are wrong and tries to force them to trade with him; he must be stopped.\n \n He may not force people to hire him, people may not force him to work for them. Why then do they work together if it is not a greater profit for both to do so?\n \n Does he think that perhaps no factory owner is fair, that it would be best if a factory existed that paid the wages he wants? He has the freedom to convince anyone who will listen of this and acquire from them the wealth required to start a new factory on this premise. It is called investment.\n \n You complain that only those with wealth could invest. Yes that is the nature not of capitalism but wealth itself. If you need a structure and manufacturing machines and a million other little things to build a factory; that is what you need. You cannot pretend that it takes no wealth to create such a device, all that is left to someone who hopes this is so is to take the wealth from others and claim it sprang from nowhere.\n \n What about very high profit margins? If someone has a company and is extracting great profit out of it everyone who works for him still agrees their wages are fair, and everyone who buys from him still agrees the prices are fair. If they did not they would not buy or sell it. When you think you are arguing only against so called greediness against him you are actually arguing against the judgement of all the employees and customers involved.\n \n Do not be confused by the fact that some depraved souls might listen to your appeal because they would rather set their prices without the consent of the company owner. You appeal to the thief in man, the fact that you can assemble a viking party does not mean northmen have a right to the french country side. It is little wonder that some care not if their sustenance is trade or theft.\n \n Let's look at taxes on the other hand. The forced removal of wealth from people, irregardless of consent is identical to theft. If a individual did it to another most agree that it is theft, but when many individuals in the form of the government do it to the minority then it is somehow just and right. How could you expect me to see your poor factory worker who is given the choice to work at the factory as enslaved but the person who is not given the choice to pay taxes as free?. How can a homeless person be a slave by virtue that no productive trade exists between him and others? Yet it is just to threaten jail time to someone because they will not surender their achievements, their labour, their life?\n \n If the factory worker rebelled against a factory owner who used force to make him work he would have much common with a rich person who rebelled against a government who used force to make him pay. He would have nothing in common with the factory workers freinds who scoffed at the 'lower classes', and nothing in common with people like you who assert that the rich owe society.\n \n Viewing people based on class is pointless exhibition of collectivist fallacy, people are people. Claiming you have the right to half a man's wealth because he has $10 is claiming you have a right to half a man's wealth if he has $1. The real pattern behind the claim is that the collective (which 'ironically' always seems to speak through individuals) has a right to any one's wealth; it just chooses to steal from the rich because it would kill people to steal from the poor. It kills people anyway the whole idea is just a disguise for the singular act of destruction and enslavement that is taxation.\n \n Our civilization has come so far since the first towns along the Tigris and Euphrates. We have established the theory for economic perfection in capitalism. All that remains is the final effort to extend the premise which capitalism is based on to public sphere.... All that remains is to have consensual government as well as consensual private interaction.\n \n You want to go in the reverse direction. Your way leads only to a second dark ages. If having rich people and poor people together in the same place is a sure fire recipe for revolution it is only because of jealousy. I don't think that is the case though. I think revolutions are caused by injustice.",
