   "Randy Cohen has a refreshing take on the rhetoric behind the health care debate, and especially ITO of the public option:\n \n -------------\n \n The Issue\n \n A health care reform bill emerged from the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions last Wednesday. But there was particularly vigorous opposition, both inside and outside the committee, to one of its provisions: the public option, a government-run insurance program meant to offer a competitive alternative to private insurers; critics condemned it as a nearly unprecedented intrusion into the private sector. This assertion was dubious enough to raise the question &#8220;Is some political debate so suspect as to be unethical?&#8221;\n \n The Argument\n \n Public discourse necessarily and legitimately involves the clash of interests and opinions: that&#8217;s what politics is. But that clash, rough as it may be, must still be conducted with intellectual integrity, not as the oratorical equivalent of Ultimate Fighting. This is a matter of honesty and thus of ethics. When an argument is disingenuous and thwarts meaningful discussion (and induces migraine in the spectators in the Capitol gallery), it should be ruled out of bounds by the Debate Umpire, an official who, as I read our Constitution, seems not to exist (a lapse I blame on Jefferson). Other institutions have such a referee. In a courtroom, for example, the judge can disallow certain affronts to ratiocination, pseudo-thinking that subverts effective inquiry. Respect for logic is essential in pursuing justice; it is equally necessary in making law.\n \n I do not know if the public option is a wise law &#8212; health policy is beyond my purview &#8212; but I do know what it is not: unusual in its general approach. Public and private institutions have long undertaken similar tasks and without dire consequences. Private schools survive public education: Brearley and Bronx Science peacefully coexist. FedEx tolerates the U.S. Postal Service. Six Flags is facing bankruptcy, but no one proposes that we close down Yosemite or Yellowstone to protect it.\n \n In his critique of the public option, Representative Paul Ryan, a Republican from Wisconsin, invoked the inability of his 7-year-old daughter&#8217;s lemonade stand to compete with McDonald&#8217;s. (You&#8217;d think she&#8217;d thrive, incidentally, what with lemonade not being on the McDonald&#8217;s menu.) &#8220;It&#8217;s impossible to have a level playing field with a public plan,&#8221; Ryan said, asserting that private insurers could be driven out of business by the unfair competitive advantages enjoyed by a government-sponsored insurer (presumably much as the University of Massachusetts turned Harvard into a ghost town, or the New York Public Library system drove Barnes & Noble into the ground). Again, this is not to challenge Ryan&#8217;s conclusions about the public option: that&#8217;s politics. It is to demand veracity in his arguments: that&#8217;s ethics.\n \n Here&#8217;s another sort of dodgy reasoning deployed on this issue. In an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, Karl Rove concluded: &#8220;If Democrats enact a public-option health-insurance program, America is on the way to becoming a European-style welfare state.&#8221; This is a slippery-slope argument, the sort of thing that should set off warning bells. If we impose a 65 miles-per-hour speed limit, we&#8217;re on the way to a 55 m.p.h. limit, then down to 5 m.p.h., and ultimately to mandatory driving in reverse. If Rove was exaggerating for rhetorical effect, he was acceptably &#8212; delightfully &#8212; bombastic; if he meant that remark literally, he was deceptive and hence unethical.\n \n In his great essay, &#8220;Politics and the English Language,&#8221; George Orwell writes, &#8220;In our time it is broadly true that political writing is bad writing.&#8221; Make it not political writing but political reasoning, and it is broadly true in our own time as well, as is this observation from the same essay: &#8220;Political language [i.e., political reasoning] &#8212; and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists &#8212; is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.&#8221;\n \n Intellectual integrity is not only an abstract virtue; it is a tool for constructing sensible public policy. If we damage that elegant and essential apparatus, no such happy outcome is possible. I do not refer to the occasional exaggeration or elastic fact or massaged statistic; such misdemeanors are common to nearly all parties in nearly every debate, an unattractive but endurable feature of democracy. I refer only to rhetoric that defies reason, oratory that the proponent knows or should know to be untrue. We call such things falsehoods, and most ethical systems, secular and religious, discourage them.\n \n Alas, the prevaricator who sincerely believes his lie transforms it, at least to himself and his confreres, from deceit to ideology. They think he is telling the truth. Dr. Johnson put it this way in The Idler, No. 10: &#8220;Of all kinds of credulity, the most obstinate and wonderful is that of political zealots; of men, who, being numbered, they know not how nor why, in any of the parties that divide a state, resign the use of their own eyes and ears, and resolve to believe nothing that does not favor those whom they profess to follow.&#8221;\n \n Lacking a Debate Umpire, our best recourse is aggressive skepticism. Each adversary must be alert to the frauds and follies of the other; each ordinary citizen must be vigilant for the deceptions of both.\n \n How Not to Talk About Health Care - The Moral of the Story Blog - NYTimes.com\n \n -----------------------\n \n This is especially the kind of thinking America needs when they should also be killing their television sets, instead of listening to FOX news campaigns. At the very least, canceling their cable subscription for the interim of the healthcare debate, so that they can sit down with legitimate publications and information and actually think, discuss, share genuine information. (And consider the message they could send to FOX this way. Not that I'm holding my breath ...)\n \n Why are so many Americans so ill-equipped to deal with, what is essentially, the art of propaganda? We are consistently, daily, bombarded with this kind of material, like crime in NYC or other large, urban centers, yet we are so inept (unlike New Yorkers or other city dwellers) in dealing with it. Why do we not, more frequently, close and lock the doors and windows, install security systems, call the police or neighbors, study martial arts, use weapons skillfully, look mean while walking, travel with companions, stay away from bad neighborhoods during evening hours, carry mace, scream, holler, run like hell, or calmly and pragmatically, go aggressively and without hesitation, for the eyes or testicles, if we must?\n \n Unfortunately, many of America's teachers are not literate enough to teach this kind of thinking, let alone employ it themselves; rather, they are purveyors of the very same techniques, perhaps the creep you ran into, taking that wrong turn down a dark alley. Consider the example of one individual in particular on this forum. Who can but blurt out his race or class supremacist one-liners. When he's not engaged in otherwise personally denigrating others. Like his similarly non-nasty, non-bigoted internet-bully friends elsewhere ... \n \n Alas, he is but another ignorant, bigoted mental brute. A psychological thug. A Bruno, not Popeye-eating-his-spinach, of thinking. Another pony who got through 20+ years teaching with one or two tricks only. Just like his fraternal, eternally-baiting, bacon-fried twin on another forum (which might as well be a dark alley unto itself, the subway car you never take, at any hour of the day or night, that multi-faceted, yet one-dimensional minded troll, being a good reason why, among some others). After all, have you ever read a post by him longer than 3 sentences? Wow, he's ingenious if it's five. Usually the same thing again and again. (I guess he thinks he's Hemmingway at that moment. And we are supposed to be deliciously supping up, savoring one by one, his sparse utterances.)\n \n Hence, one can discern how America's children, now the adults, unable to deal with language with any depth of comprehension, bumble along with our clowns in Congress, and their one-liners, instead, the health insurance industry's oxymoronic mission, not-even-that-slick P.R. campaign, gassed at the pump by FOX's side shows, not-skeptic, passive prey to every rhetorical trick from where ever it's coming, with \"left\" or \"right\" even questionable categorizations these days.",
