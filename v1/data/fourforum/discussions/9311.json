   "Well, something I can comment semi-knowingly about, as I work in a District Attorney office (Prosecutor's office) as a certified legal intern [I AM STILL IN LAW SCHOOL AND NOT A LAWYER]. \n \n Yes, when a prosecutor steps over the line and keeps exculpatory evidence such as DNA under raps for a re-election campaign they have crossed a very serious line, and as we have seen from the Duke case, there are real consequences. Prosecutors generally (see local rules for exact language) have a responsibility. In the ABA Model Rules of Pro Conduct rule 3.8 deals with \"Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor\" and states they must \"make timely disclosure to the defense fo all evidence or information known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense.\" ABA Model Rule 3.8(d) 2007 ed.\n \n Now, I must defend most Prosecutors. Almost every defendant charged is guilty, and this is reflected by how few things got to trial, and how obvious some of the cases are. That is to say, if you have a guy with blood shot eyes, slurred speech, difficulty handing over a DL, and a strong smell of alcohol, you probably have a drunk driver. It is also possible that errors are made because usually defense attorneys (specifically the PD's office) and DA's (specifically for simpler cases) do not have time to fully review and analyze files. It isn't there fault, it's part of the while idea of the \"full dockets of the court.\" Also, Prosecutors have duties, they cannot prosecutor someone unless they feel that they can ethically meet that bar, and i've seen cases dropped because our attorney honestly felt that they couldn't meet that bar.\n \n Finally, I would note the comment about Scooter Libby. He was obviously guilty, as both a Grand Jury and a Petit Jury and a Judge all agreed. In fact, the only people who think that he is innocent are the members of the far right who somehow feel that the whole thing was VPlame's fault. I don't get it, but they may feel free to argue the point.",

Oh well there is no accounting for taste and some animals are more equal than others. He may of course end up with a get out of jail free card yet. Hope not though.

   "I agree with you that PDs often lack the necessary time to prepare for defense. Still I have worked with PDs and Federal Defenders offices on cases they believed might justify my fees and I have gained an admiration for the dedication I have seen within my small sample. They seem to put in far more hours than they can justify. I have also worked with private criminal defense attorneys with more resources than PDs. The few I know are impssibly addicted to their work and I have NEVER seen anyone work that hard. When they say the defense never rests - better believe it.",

   "Prosecutors are paid regardless of outcome.

Most are ADA (assistant District Attorneys) hired by the county with the approval the DA. Also, most DA's go to trial on very few cases. So, in summation, money often has little to do with it.
