   "upon my short absence, it occurred to me that although debating this topic is fun and all, its silly, its a waste of time and its also an insult to evolutionary biology, general biology, science and the scientific method. debating with a creationist is pretty much like punching Aristotle in the face.\n \n a major part of the scientific method is debate. its a great way to learn new ideas, share thoughts and argue a theory's position, not to mention helping the public learn about new and exciting things that are happening in science. and as ive said time and time again, ID is NOT a scientific theory. it has no scientific validity and it should be completely ignored by everyone who values science. thus being said, debating with a creationist is to flatter him into thinking that his 'theory' is legitimate.\n \n we evolutionary biologists and people who are interested in evolution have better things to worry about than a group of religious aggressors trying desperately to scratch at the heart of this brilliant theory in order to superimpose religious doctrine into universities and high schools.\n \n debating with creationists is also completely pointless. ive met many people who follow ID, in my line of study they just cant leave us alone. and no matter how much information you give or how much evidence you present, they will always ignore and attack. its pathetic. also, i find that somewhere around 95-99% of creationists havent the slightest clue how science or the scientific method works and 100% of them have no idea how evolution works. they were brought up from birth to believe that a certain scripture is to be followed and believed in, and to be shown something outside of that box is freaky for them.\n \n also, im really curious about why exactly religious people, especially christians will do anything for you to join their church. theyll say its to save your soul when you die, but cmon... if that were true they wouldnt be wasting their time challenging Richard Dawkins to boxing matches. its obvious that they have no legitimate scientific theory with ID, but why must they attack evolution relentlessly? im curious as to why they are so persistent.\n \n but whatever, right? its fun and i enjoy talking about evolution, zoology and botany. im not here to have a proper scientific debate, im here to hopefully teach people something.",
