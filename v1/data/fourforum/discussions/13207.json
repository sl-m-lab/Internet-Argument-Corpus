   "Two firefighters die as floor collapses at East Side deli fire : Home: The Buffalo News\n \n \n \n Two firefighters die as floor collapses at East Side deli fire\n By Gene Warner, Brian Meyer and Pete Simon\n News Staff Reporters\n August 24, 2009 \n \n \n \nTwo Buffalo firefighters were killed in an early-morning fire at a deli on Genesee Street on the city's East Side, the department's worst loss of life in the last 26 years.\n \n The dead were identified as Lt. Charles W. \"Chip\" McCarthy Jr., 45, of Rescue 1, and Firefighter Jonathan S. Croom, 34, of Ladder 7.\n \n The deaths were confirmed at about 9:50 a.m. by the Rev. Derren L. Young, Erie County Medical Center trauma chaplain. The bodies were taken out of the building on gurneys draped with American flags.\n \n Reports from the scene indicated the two firefighters may have fallen through the first floor while searching for a civilian victim. Earlier reports that someone was trapped inside were not confirmed, and some officials questioned whether a third person had been trapped.\n \n \"It's a very tragic day for the city of Buffalo,\" Mayor Byron W. Brown said during a noon news conference. \"Our hearts are broken right now.\"\n \n McCarthy leaves behind his wife, three children and a 6-month-old grandchild. Croom leaves behind a 9-month-old child and a fiancee. A few years ago, Croom himself lost a young child.\n \n Fire Commissioner Michael S. Lombardo fought back tears during the news conference, saying he knew both men and described them as \"tremendous firefighters\" who both received honors for their work in the past.\n \n \"This is a family, and we lost two members of our family,\" Lombardo said.\n\n \n =snip=\n \n \n \n Their funerals are slated for Friday, August 28. Lt. McCarthy's will be at 9:30AM and FF Croom's will be at 1:00 PM, both at St. Joseph's Cathedral. Folks, I would like you to remember their families and the entire buffalo Fire Department in their prayers. For the next couple of weeks, my avatar will be the insignia of the Buffalo Fire Department in honor of these two brave men who gave their very lives.",
