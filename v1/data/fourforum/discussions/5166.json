He tried to assassinate Bush 41. He was paying off Palestinian terrorists at $25,000 a pop. And the U.N. wanted to give him \"forever\" to comply.

As you will recall from Woodward's book, there were some 68 war plans on Rummy's desk when he took office; one of which was a plan to invade Great Britain. But think back to D-Day. That was a plan long in coming to fruition but had the circumstances been unfavorable the invasion would not have taken place; perhaps for months. Bush could have called off the Iraq invasion up to the time the first bomb fell if Saddam had taken the last chance offer to get out of Dodge. Clearly, no sane person can welcome going to war because one can never be certain of the outcome. The war can be won but what comes afterwards is up for grabs as Bush pointed out in his recent trip to Europe for VE celebrations. Who would have wanted the Soviet Union to subjugate eastern Europe for half a century? That was an unintended consequence of our going after Hitler. The lesser of two evils. One could argue that Bush had to choose between allowing Saddam to remain in power and the very real possibility that he would at some time use WMD against the U.S. especially after 9/11.

I see good reasons for going into it, and reasons not to. However what concerns me more is not the war itself, but the way the war was conducted after we took Baghdad.

I just didn't see it happening.\n \n Having said that, Saddam was a menace to our vital interests, namely oil. I know people don't like to hear that, but thats has been the strategic focus of Iraq and Iran for the last 30 years. It was the reason we kept Iraq and Iran bludgening each other in their war and is the reason we kicked Saddam in GW1. Our strategy for the last 30 years was to make sure there would be no single hostile hegemon capable of controlling the region (oil), beisdes ourselves. for that reason alone, the stalemate with Saddam with the sanctions and the no fly zones was a totally unacceptable position. \n \n On basic humanitarian grounds removing Saddam was a good idea, however countries rarely spend blood and treasure for only that reason.
