American reporters accustomed to freedom and the rule of law experience Iraq today as a place of danger and violence. Iraqis who lived under Saddam were accustomed to tyranny, cruelty, and secret police. What do they make of their country today?\n \n To find out, three Americans (two filmmakers and a former Marine) distributed 150 digital video cameras to ordinary Iraqis, asking them to record anything they considered worthwhile and then pass the cameras on to others. The resulting 450 hours of footage from 2,000 Iraqis was distilled into an 80-minute documentary, \"Voices of Iraq.\" As Jacoby writes, the documentary \"is by turns heartbreaking, exhilarating, and inspiring. The war and its destruction is never far from the surface. . . . But bad as the war is, the horror it ended--Saddam's 24-year reign--was worse. . . . Yet for all they have been through, Iraqis come across as incredibly optimistic, hopeful, and enthusiastic. And above all, normal.\"\n \n \n On the economic front...\n \n http://www.portaliraq.com/shownews.php?id=688\n \n The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has agreed to establish 100 agricultural support sites throughout Iraq to strengthen crop and livestock production. Programs are already in place to revitalize historically important agricultural industries such as date production in central and southern Iraq and fish farming in the restored Iraqi marshlands. \n Iraq's oil sector also will benefit from training programs and technical exchanges established under the terms of two bilateral memorandums of understanding signed during the meeting. . . . The Iraqi officials also discussed their plans to restructure the oil industry in order to create opportunities for private and foreign investment. \n \n The United States offered to provide technical support for Iraq's banking sector. This support would include assistance in restructuring the state bank and supervising commercial banks as well as in training commercial bank officers in loan management. The U.S. Treasury and USAID will also help the Iraqi government establish a mortgage finance program to support its plans to build 30,000 new residential units in the Baghdad area during 2005. \n \n The U.S. and Iraqi officials studied the need to boost private-sector job creation, and the United States reported on a USAID program to distribute 16,000 small-business loans over the next six months. USAID also plans to establish 11 new vocational education centers and 10 new job placement centers across the country. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A Japanese contribution...\n \n http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2004-12/28/content_2388808.htm\n \n The Japanese government is providing another reconstruction grant of 10 billion yen ($96 million): \n \n Of the amount, 8.45 billion yen (81 million dollars) will go to health and home affairs ministries of the Iraqi interim government's funds to buy 700 ambulances, 150 police buses and 500 police motorcycles to improve the security situation all over Iraq. . . . \n Japan will also allocate 866 million yen (8.3 million dollars) for the government of the southern Iraqi province of Muthana, where Japanese troops are stationed, to buy medical equipment for 32 local primary health centers. \n \n The remaining 658 million yen (6.3 million dollars) will be for the city of Samawah, the provincial capital, to buy garbage-collecting equipment such as vehicles and containers. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A good soldier's contribution...\n \n http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04357/430371.stm\n \n Douglas Hottle, of Lebanon, Pa., a judge advocate general serving with the 372nd Engineering Group, is involving his local community in collecting school supplies for Iraqi children: \n \n Hottle was part of a group of soldiers who, in October, distributed $75,000 worth of school supplies to Iraqi children. Those supplies had been collected largely from Iowa by Maj. Chuck Larson, of Cedar Rapids, a fellow JAG who is an Iowa state senator. Larson founded the collection project under the name Operation Iraqi Hope. Through e-mail messages, Hottle said he moved to start his own collection after the October distributions wiped out the stockpile that Larson had collected.\n \n \n \n \n \n The Seabees @ work...\n \n http://www.centcom.mil/CENTCOMNews/News_Release.asp?NewsRelease=20041236.txt\n \n Navy Seabees attached to the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit in Najaf completed their part in a major road expansion project in Kufa today. The work was done at the request of Najaf Province's governor, Adnan al-Zurufi, as part of a larger government road expansion project. The project consisted of widening 3 km of a major thoroughfare between Najaf and Kufa, turning the two lane road into a four lane road. Seabees leveled and grated the ground, laid a rock and sand mixture as the road's sub-base, and the rolled and compacted the sub-base. A local contractor will be hired to asphalt the additional two lanes. \n \n \n \n \n And here's a story about news bias...\n \n It explains why you hear more of the bad news that the good.\n \n http://chrenkoff.blogspot.com/\n \n \n Friday, January 21, 2005\n Bad news from Iraq \n Updated - see at the bottom of the post.\n \n Being avid consumers of news, most of us are aware of the consistent stream of negative reporting coming out of Iraq. Death, violence, terrorism, precarious political situation, problems with reconstruction and public frustration (both in Iraq and America) dominate, if not overwhelm, the mainstream media coverage and commentary on Iraq. The readers' reactions to my fortnightly \"Good news from Iraq\" segments show just how little good news reaches people.\n \n But it's one thing to have a gut feeling about media negativity and another to know exactly how negative the coverage is. So today I decided to do a little tally.\n \n Friday, 21 January (Australian time) is an average day as far as Iraq is concerned. Google news indexes the following negative stories concerning Iraq:\n \n 2,642 stories about Condi Rice's confirmation hearings, in the context of grilling she has received over the Administration's Iraq policy\n \n 1,992 stories about suicide bombings and other terrorist attacks\n \n 887 stories about prisoner abuse by British soldiers\n \n 2,345 stories about President Bush's inauguration, in the context of the President failing to mention the word \"Iraq\" in his speech, or indeed discuss the war\n \n 216 stories about hostages currently being held in Iraq\n \n 761 stories reporting on activities and public statements of insurgents\n \n 357 stories about the anti-war movement and the dropping public support for involvement in Iraq\n \n 182 stories about American servicemen killed and wounded in operations\n \n 217 stories about concerns for fairness and validity of Iraqi election (low security, low turnout, etc.)\n \n 107 stories about civilian deaths in Iraq\n \n 123 stories noting Vice President Cheney's admission that he had underestimated the task of reconstruction\n \n 219 stories about possible military action against Iran\n \n 24 stories about tense relations with Syria\n \n 118 stories about complicated and strained relations between the US and Europe\n \n 121 stories discussing the possibility of American pullout\n \n 27 stories about sabotage of Iraqi oil infrastructure\n \n 660 stories about prosecutions in the Oil for Food scandal\n \n Then we have 123 stories - ostensibly neutral - about details of current troop deployments and movements. I write \"ostensibly\" because among that number there are numerous stories about deserters or soldiers refusing orders.\n \n Finally we come to positive news:\n \n 311 stories about voter registration for Iraqis overseas. Even here we have to be cautious as significant number of these stories comment on \"disappointingly\" low numbers registering.\n \n 16 stories about security successes in the fight against insurgents\n \n 7 stories about positive developments relating to elections\n \n 73 stories about the return to Iraq of stolen antiques.\n \n If the media coverage was war, the good guys would be getting slaughtered. Well, maybe the media coverage is war... \n \n *******************************************\n Chrenkoff is an awsome Aussie!",
