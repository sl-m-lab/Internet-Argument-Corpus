   "And Gays account for half of HIV cases..This is really scary.....\n \n http://kitsapsun.com/bsun/nw_national/article/0,2403,BSUN_19093_38\n \n By DANIEL YEE, associated press\n June 14, 2005\n \n ATLANTA\n \n More than a million Americans are believed to be living with the virus that causes AIDS, the government said Monday in a report that reflects both a victory and a failure at combatting the disease.\n \n While better medicines are keeping more people with HIV alive, government health officials have failed to \"break the back\" of the AIDS epidemic by their stated goal of 2005. This is believed to be the first time the 1 million mark has been passed since the height of the epidemic in the 1980s.\n \n New medicines that weren't around in 1981 have allowed people infected with the virus to live longer, said Dr. Ronald Valdiserri, deputy director of the CDC's National Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention.\n \n \"While treatment advances have been an obvious godsend to those living with the disease, it presents new challenges for prevention,\" he said as the National HIV Prevention Conference got under way. Among the challenges is reaching an estimated 25 percent of those with HIV who don't even know they have it.\n \n That in part is why the CDC has been unable to fulfill the 2001 pledge made by the agency's Dr. Robert Janssen to \"break the back\" of the epidemic by cutting in half the estimated 40,000 new HIV infections that have occurred every year since the 1990s.\n \n \"It is clear that we have not achieved that goal. We have not halved the rates of new infections,\" Valdiserri said. \"But we do think we are making progress.\"\n \n However, some critics think the number of new annual infections could be even higher than 40,000.\n \n \"We're seeing more infections, that's the bad news. But the good news is many of us are living longer,\" said Terje Anderson, who was diagnosed with HIV eight years ago and AIDS four years ago. He now serves as executive director of the National Association of People Living with AIDS.\n \n \"It just points out how far we still have to go in really dealing effectively with this in this country. Maybe passing the million mark will drive home that this thing is getting bigger and it's not going away.\"\n \n Health officials say the prevention failure in part has come from an abandonment of safe sex practices by gay and bisexual men - who account for almost half of HIV cases. Experts think they may be weary of STD prevention messages. The majority of the others infected are high-risk heterosexuals and injection drug users.\n \n One difficulty is that despite increases in routine HIV testing many people have not been tested.\n \n More than a quarter of the people living with HIV have not been diagnosed, the CDC estimated.",

   "Personally I'd say that safe-sex practices are not being abandoned, and more and more gay men are being safe and responsible. The only way we could determine whether gay men are actually abandoning safe-sex techniques to take a valid poll of gay men's sex habits, rather than inferring such from the number and rate of new HIV infections. \n \n If gay men were abandoning safe-sex practices, then I can assure you that there would have been a radical increase in the rate and number of HIV infections, rather than the relatively steady rate that the article indicates.\n \n In the gay community the steady rate of HIV infections is blamed on the increase in drug abuse, particularly crystal meth, and the over-confidence in new anti-AIDS drugs that leads many people to take risks that they would have otherwise not considered.\n \n I suspect the same reasons apply to the increasing rate of HIV infections in straight people - people taking risks that they don't fully understand, or aren't able to understand. \n \n http://www.gay.com/health/hiv/?sernum=3138\n http://www.gay.com/health/hiv/?sernum=3161\n http://www.gay.com/content/slideshow/?coll=487&navpath=/channels/health/hiv/slideshow/",

   "Indeed, most of the people who have already caught the disease are gay men. That's a fact. \n \n It's also a fact that a disproportionate number of people with the disease are black. I would not characterize it as a black problem though.\n \n One problem with prevention efforts is that many people think that they are protected by their class - because they're straight, white, and not an intravenous drug user. Back when HIV was considered \"The Gay Disease\", it made its first inroads into an unprepared straight population. Because it is considered a \"White Disease\" it has made vast inroads into the African-American community through black men who refused to identify with a white concept of 'gayness' (the infamous 'down-low').\n \n Some parts of the gay community are responding positively (no pun intended) to the crisis and are mounting campaigns against unsafe sex, up to and including crashing sex parties and screaming at people. In fact some gays are doing as much as they can within the limit of the law. Others are continuing to take risks and put others at risk.\n \n The fact is that there are segments of the gay community who are at equal or even less risk than the heterosexual average, and there are segments who don't so much as have a risk so much as a death-wish. Lumping those elements together to make AIDS \"mostly a gay problem\" ignores much more relevant divisions than sexual orientation, and creates a dangerous sense of complacency.\n \n We already know the dangers of complacency, such as when heterosexuals thought that they couldn't contract the viruses that cause AIDS, or when homosexuals relaxed in the face of new anti-HIV drugs. \n \n Right now instead of condeming the entire American gay community for the actions of a few, it would be more productive if those working in the gay community to eradicate the epidemic had some support. We know safe-sex works, and we know that gay men as a group need more of it, and we don't need to be reminded of that by straight people. What we do need is a supportive environment for gays that doesn't reinforce the common rejection complex that many self-destructive gay men have. \n \n One thing that'll help is calling for openness about homosexuality so that closet-cases don't engage in risky sex or bring STDs home to their wives, so as to avoid the 'down-low effect'. \n \n Another thing that'll help is encouraging gay monogamy. Less partners means less opportunity to spread disease, and less time wasted chasing tail. \n \n This is about harm reduction. So you don't like homosexuality, or have religious objections to it, or whatever, it doesn't matter. You don't have to like someone's choice to live as an openly gay man. However you do have to welcome these people into your community and give them the support that they need to make the most of their lives. \n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050613/ap_on_he_me/hiv_cases_2;_ylt=Aq85FDLr5caBSTipVYr9la.gyygB;_ylu=X3oDMTBiMW04NW9mBHNlYwMlJVRPUCUl",

This risk is unfortunately derived from the relative numbers of who has been infected, rather than the relative numbers of who has been infected and who has not. \n \n What we don't know is the ratio of the number of men who have topped in unprotected anal sex with an HIV positive partner with regards to who contracted HIV and who did not. Likewise we don't know the ratio of the number of men who have topped in unprotected vaginal sex with an HIV positive partner with regards to who contracted HIV and who did not.\n \n We certainly have a good idea of what enhances your risk of contracting HIV, such as open sores on your penis, and even micro-tears, but we don't have a good idea of whether you will get HIV from a specific act of sex with a specific person or not beyond this highly abstract risk. \n \n The facts are that as a top you can get HIV through vaginal penetration as well as anal penetration.
