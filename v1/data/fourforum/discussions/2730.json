Another person who has flunked english 101. \n \n Read these two and see if you understand them. \n \n \nGeneral Deterrence: People will engage in criminal and deviant activities if they do not fear apprehension and punishment. Norms, laws, and enforcement are to be designed and implemented to produce and maintain the image that \"negative\" and disruptive behaviors will receive attention and punishment. Although specific individuals become the object of enforcement activities, general deterrence theory focuses on reducing the probability of deviance in the general population. Examples of control activities reflecting the concerns of this concept include: Drunk-driving crackdowns, special gang-related crime task forces and police units, publication and highly visible notices of laws and policies (Notice: Shoplifters will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law), and the death penalty.\n \n Specific Deterrence: General deterrence strategies focus on future behaviors, preventing individuals from engaging in crime or deviant by impacting their rational decision making process. Specific deterrence focuses on punishing known deviants in order to prevent them from ever again violating the specific norms they have broken. The concern here is that motives and rationales that lie behind the original behavior can, perhaps, never be delineated, but through the rational use of punishment as a negative sanction, problematic behavior can be extinguished.

MAD, mutually assured destruction was the strategy used by the US and USSR to prevent a first strike attack from one on the other. In the US, we chose a 3-pronged strategy: land-based missiles, nuclear warhead equipped subs and strategic bombers in the air at all times. The theory being that we would be able to effectively wipe out the USSR even if one or two of our 3-prongs was eliminated by a first strike. The USSR, for the most part, took a similar tact but with a differing weapon mix. The key was that each side possessed enough nuclear power to wipe out each other many times over, even if part of their arsenal was neutralized by a first strike.\n Now, for some personal historical perspective. In the 1950's, my father was a Civil Defense Director for our county. He was responsible for assessing damage, calculating fallout patterns, defensive measures, etc., In fact, I still have in my possession his Geiger Counter and a CD film on the effects of the nuclear explosion on Hiroshimo. ( It's a 16mm documentary that is very scary. )\n MAD was the basis for at least a few old movies, namely Fail Safe and it's spoof \"Dr. Strangelove- or how I learned to stop woorrying and love the bomb\" as well as a few newer flicks like The Day After and Twilight's Last Gleaming, IIRC.\n Reagan's Star Wars program threatened the deterrent value of MAD, so he made a bold move and told the USSR that we should jointly develop SDI technology, thereby keeping the playing field level.",

   "a criminal that is executed is deterred from committing any further crimes\n\n \n A criminal cannot be deterreted if he is dead, because he can no longer be motivatied by fear of the consequences, which is the accepted meaning of deterrence, one you choose to ignore. A criminal can no longer act, and therefore can no longer commit ANYTHING other then decay. \n \n \nwhen I demonstrated that the word was, in fact, used accurately, you changed strategy and attempted to argue thye concept of the death penalty as a deterrent to others.\n\n \n But it was not because you did conviently choose to ignore the modifying, and vital part of the meaning. You left out the REASON of prevention instead to uphold a single word. There are other words that accurartly describe your argument, but deter is not one of them. \n \n \nYou think that the word dererrence can only be used in the context of using fear to prevent actions by others. I demonstrated that the term also means \"to prevent\" \n\n \n By choosing to ignore the other half of the word that gives it it's meaning in the english language. We COULD talk like that in every day life, except no one would understand anything and the world would be completely chaotic. If you say you are a writer, doesn't that mean you understand how words modify others and without certain words, they lose all essence of meaning? \n \n \nI'm busting a gut here.

   "Agreed. You people are driving me nuts. Somebody concede the point. \n \n Deterrance=scaring somebody so they don't commit a particular act or group of acts.\n \n easy enough. You can't deter somebody once they are dead. The death penalty is not deterrance for the person executed. The death penalty is deterrance for the rest of society, both criminals, potential crimanals, and average citizens. It is the governments way of reminding you that if they find you objectionable enough, they CAN and WILL kill you.\n \n Personally, I think it has less to do with crime, even as a deterrent, than it does with reminding us all who is running the place and exactly how much power they have (that would be the governement, and they have LOTS of power, up to and including the power to kill you). \n \n I was discussing this the other day with my sister who is a psychologist. We disagree on almost every political issue there is since she is about as far left as you can get on pretty much every issue out there. We speak very rarely, and when we do we try to steer clear of politics. She does have an interesting argument when it comes to the death penalty, though, and I have to say I think it makes sense. I am anti-death penalty anyway, since I feel that either it is wrong to kill people, in which case we shouldn't do it, or it is OK to kill people, in which case we shouldn;t be making a fuss over it when people get murdered. I also don't think that the government should have the power to execute people. The governemnt gets its power from the people, and the people don't have the right to execute people (at the vaery least it is a gross violation of their civil rights), so it stands to reason that we cannot give the government power that we ourselves do not posess.\n \n Anyway, her argument is that the death penalty, form a purely psychological sense, does not make any sense. The vast majority of murders that are commited are not premeditated. They are carried out in a fit of rage, or fear (such as in the case of a thief shooting a police officer or citizen during a robbery). In this case, the death penalty has little or no value as a deterrent, since the emotional state of the person does not exactly lend itself to wholly rational thought. In many cases such as this, the act of murder is very nearly a reflex. This is not to say that people should not be punished in these cases, but it is highly unlikely that somebody who is in such a state of emotional distress that they are ready to kill somebody is likely to stop and consider the possible penalties rationally.\n \n In the case of premeditated murder, the death penalty makes even less sense as a deterent. In most cases, people who commit premeditated murder (and I am talking real, honest to god premeditated murder here, not the BS cases we have seen recently where prosecutors have claimed that if somebody has 30 seconds to think about it it was premeditated), the person plans the murder, and honestly believes they will not be caught. In this case, it is pretty unlikely that the potential for being executed is likely to have any real effect on the decisionmaking process (she has a very long explanation for why, but I don't have the time it would take to put it all down right now). Life in prison is, on its own, a pretty serious deterrent, and adding one level past that is pretty much worthless. \n \n A third class of murders are commited by guys like Bundy. These folks are mentally ill, are sometimes unable to stop killing, and no amount of deterrent is going to stop them. Fortunatly, there are very few of these folks running around (depending on whose estimates you want to look at, there are likely between 100 and 500 serial killers running around America at any given time).\n \n I would like to present a hypothesis as far as deterrents go. I think that once you get enough \"deterrence\" in place, it actually becomes a catalyst for violent crime. Lets not kid ourselves, we know what causes crime. Lack of education contributes enormously, as does a poor socioeconomic structure. Crimes are not generally commited by sociopaths, they are generally commited by people who are desperate. \n \n Personally, I can kind of understand this. It is easy to look at a guy who robs a bank or a convenience store and write him off as a \"bad guy\". I cannot gaurantee that I would not do the exact same thing if my back was against the wall, though. It is easy to sit there in your comfortable middle class home, with your 2 cars in the garge and your 2.5 kids playing in the yard and think of criminals as scumbags, but if you were in a situation where your family was hungry and you were facing the very real possibilty of being homeless wit your family, I don't think there is a man in America who would not commit a crime to take care of his family.\n \n Anyway, we have imposed these incredibly harsh penalties for people who commit crimes. I think that this makes people more likely to resort to violence in order to get away with commiting crimes. \n \n If you look at violent crime in America, it rose pretty steadily, and disporportionatly to other crime, then it began a fairly steady decline that IS porportionate to other crime. If you look at what was going on as far as out criminal justice system in those years where violent crime was skyrocketing, we were imposing harsher and harsher penalties. A lot of this violence came with the drug trade, which is still booming today. but without so much violence. While we tend to envision drug dealers as movie type millionairs, the vast majority of the drug dealers busted during that time period were small time nobodies who were hustling to make a buck. If you were a drug dealer, and were about to get busted, and you knew that meant going to prison for 10 years (mandatory sentencing being what it is/was), and you saw a way out, even if it did involve serious violence (i.e shooting your way out), would you do it? i think I would\n \n think about what 10 years in prison means. When you get out, your life is, of course, ruined. You have no money, no real prospect of ever getting a decent job because you are a felon, and if you had a family, you are pretty much a stranger by then. There is a better than average chance that your wife has left you. you are basically penniless, and you have just burned 10 years of you life away.\n \n The decline in crime did not come with lengthier and more outrageous prison terms. It came with social programs that addressed the root causes of crime. This is one thing I really have to give the democrats credit for. I am generally not fond of liberal/democratic ideals as a whole, but they really did get some good programs passed that have helped address crime. You are always going to have those who are more or less criminals by nature, and you will never really be able to do anything about them. By helping those who are criminals by desperation, I think you can make a huge difference in the crime numebrs (and history seems to back this up). \n \n I think that if we want to decreas violent crime even further, we need to remove mandatory sentencing guidelines and put sentencing power back in the hands of the judges, where it belongs. I would personally rather combat crime than punish criminals. If a guy walks into court on a charge of theft, shows the judge that he stole a car because he can't find a job, and his family is starving, I would have no problem at all with the judge sentencing him to probation and a job development program. Unfortunatly, in my state, he would get a mandatory 3 years. Same guy gets out, has fewer prospects than he did before, and ends up commiting more crimes. \n \n We started imposing mandatory senteces because we anted to appear tough on crime. And crime went up. So we imposed tougher mandatory sentences, and crime went up some more. Are people really so stupid that they cannot see the connection here? Are we really such a shallow, vengeful society that we prefer to punish crimainals rather than stop crime?",

OK\nOf course.\n \n \n \nAnd Phunting, I suggest that you find yourself a better dictionary. :p \n Hardly. One of the advantages of working in the same building as my ministry's library is that I have access to the 20 volume Oxford English Dictionary which is regarded, as I am sure you'll agree, as the most comprehensive and definitive dictionary of the English language in the world. As authoritative as 'factmonster.com' is...\n \n Firstly let us look at the origin of the word. It originates in the 16th century, and is from the Latin 'deterrere', which is 'de' meaning 'away from' and 'terrere' meaning 'frighten'. So as you can see it's literal meaning is to move someone away from something by frightening them.\n \n Now the OED definition:\n \n \n \ndeterrent\n noun \n A thing that discourages or is intended to discourage someone from doing something. Cameras are a major deterrent to crime.\n A nuclear weapon or weapons system regarded as deterring an enemy from attack.\n adjective\n Able or intended to deter. The deterrent effect of heavy prison sentences.\nWhich appears to agree with me.\n \n Now your argument is based around the fact that some dictionaries list deterrence to mean 'preventing' something. And indeed it does, for if you discourage something you are in effect preventing it. Yet this does not mean that the word is synonymous with 'prevent', as prevent encapsulates much more. As an example if I were to fall out of my office window, the laws of physics would prevent me from flying. However it would be incorrect to say they 'deter' me from flying, as no human choice is involved. Deterrence implies choice, if I am falling (or have been executed) I have no choice in events therefore am not deterred from them. However in the above example the laws of gravity do actually act as a deterrent, as I am careful not to place myself in a situation where I could fall out of the window, for fear of the consequences.\n \n Now from the linguistic definition, we move on to the legal definition. What is a deterrence in regard to punishment? Unfortunately I don't have access to a law dictionary at work so will have to settle for online ones:\n \n \n \nDeterrence is a criminological theory. Deterrence is the idea that someone can be prevented from committing a crime by fear of the potential consequences. Deterrence is the primary theory of punishment in the United States legal system.\n\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence\n \n \n \nDeterrence: A strategy of punishment associated with the Classical School. Deterrence can either be specific, punishing an individual so that she won't commit a crime again, or general, punishing an individual to set an example to society, so that others will not commit the same crime. For the Classical School, punishment was primarily justified in terms of general deterrence. See also Retribution, Rehabilitation, and Incapacitation.\n\n \n http://www.crimetheory.com/glossary.htm\n \n \n \nPeople will engage in criminal and deviant activities if they do not fear apprehension and punishment. Norms, laws, and enforcement are to be designed and implemented to produce and maintain the image that \"negative\" and disruptive behaviors will receive attention and punishment. Although specific individuals become the object of enforcement activities,general deterrence theory focuses on reducing the probability of deviance in the general population. Examples of control activities reflecting the concerns of this concept include: Drunk-driving crackdowns, special gang-related crime task forces and police units, publication and highly visible notices of laws and policies (Notice: Shoplifters will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law), and the death penalty.\n \n Specific Deterrence: General deterrence strategies focus on future behaviors, preventing individuals from engaging in crime or deviant by impacting their rational decision making process. Specific deterrence focuses on punishing known deviants in order to prevent them from ever again violating the specific norms they have broken. The concern here is that motives and rationales that lie behind the original behavior can, perhaps, never be delineated, but through the rational use of punishment as a negative sanction, problematic behavior can be extinguished. Examples: shock sentencing, corporal punishment, mandatory arrests for certain behaviors (domestic violence), etc.\n\n \n http://www.umsl.edu/~rkeel/200/ratchoc.html\n \n So as you see legally the death penalty is a general deterrent as it is only a deterrence in that it scares others into not committing the crime through example to others. Specific deterrents, ones that change the criminals behaviour, are designed to stop the criminals committing the crimes through choice, as again they are scared of suffering the same punishments again.\n \n Apologies to everyone on these forums for all this, but it had to be cleared up.",

So, seems to me that when you make death a quick (as in timely) and certain punishment, there is most definitely a deterent effect. Now, the problem I REALLY have with the death penalty is the method. We all know that if we can choose our way of dying, we would all most certainly choose to die painlessly in our sleep. Well, death row inmates have it great in those terms, do they not? They get to be put to sleep..plain and simple..what a great way to go.

Attached is additional information provided by the Judicial Branch.\n \n Recent legislation also addressed prison overcrowding by (1) creating a zero-tolerance drug supervision program, (2) altering parole eligibility, (3) expanding eligibility for the pretrial drug education and alcohol education programs, (4) expanding eligibility for the community service labor program, (5) giving judges discretion to impose less than the law's mandatory minimum sentence on some drug felons, (6) expanding eligibility for accelerated rehabilitation, (7) creating a state prevention council, and (8) increasing the credit that a person receives for his confinement in certain circumstances. A 2001 act authorized the Judicial Branch, within available appropriations, to establish an alternative incarceration center in the New Haven Judicial District.\"\n http://www.cga.state.ct.us/2002/olrdata/jud/rpt/2002-R-0777.htm\n \n \"IDOC officials say that this measure will allow them to control, without incarcerating in prison, approximately 6,300 offenders of the projected 10,000 population growth over the next four years. This legislation does not address prison overcrowding per se. It allows IDOC to free up beds by moving two-thirds of those expected to overcrowd the system into less expensive means of control: boot camps and electronic detention and greater incentives - reductions in sentences - to more inmates who participate in more rehabilitation programs.

Wow, the world is black and white with you. What I was talking about was the use of the word by the rest of the world, the use of the word throughout history, and the use of the word in law, explain to me how those are the same as nitpicking on the use of \"a\" and \"an.\" \n \n Apparently dispelling fallacies as well as giving legal definitions is snide to you. \n \n \nRemember, it was you who wrote:\n \"JPSartre12: Oh boy. Another person who has flunked english 101. \"\n \"Yup, you failed english. \"\n\n \n Not to mention a few other things I won't mention. \n \n \nIs that how you debate? I always thougth that personal attacks were the weakest form of argument. You can't fault the argument, so you attack the person.\n\n \n Well considering how \"well\" you debated the point with ignoring history, ignoring the use of it in law, ignoring the accepted use, using fallacies, using distortions and lies, and upholding a single word and ignoring the rest (I talked the pizza!), it really doesn't matter. I didn't post that ridiculous essays which essentially has the argument Bobby was around when the birds flew, therefore Bobby made the birds fly. \n \n \nIsn't that exactly what you intended to do with your comments above? You provoked a response, in kind , and now want to run away from it.\n \n\n \n How am I running away from it. You keep ignoring the fact that you are ignoring a vast amount of information to uphold a single word instead of the entire meaning. I talked the pizza! Is that correct? In your eyes yes. \n \n \nI passed English 101; I passed Technical Writing for Scientists; I passed Calculus, Physics, Organic Chemistry and a plethora of other courses. \n\n \n Being a blowhard doesn't mean you are correct. Physics has nothing to do with accepted legal definitions. Another fallacy you are using, along with knowledge of the ancients. Much of your arguments are based on known fallacies I have pointed out time and time again, and which you have ignored time and time again. Do you have any real facts or just fallacies? \n \n \nAgain with the cocky attitude. We all know that the Supreme Court is the end all for everything, right? IMO, the Supreme Court has a batting average of about 0.500. \n\n \n At least they don't judge on lies, distortions, and ignorance as the essay you did does. That's quite something to say that when you have posted a essay far worse then how they judge. Ignoring the fact that you did this doesn't make you right. \n \n \nYou tried to take my use of the word deterrent, as applied to the daisy pusher, and argue that the criminal's death didn't \"deter\" him from committing another crime on a purely myoptic understanding of the definition of deter. Was that arguing substance over semantics?\n\n \n Purely myoptic understanding? Is that what you call the historical use of the word for the past 3,000 years? Apparently the legal definition, historical definiton and accept defintion are all semantics to you have no bearing. If we all ignored parts of word we did not like, no one could communicate. I talked the pizza! You can constantly ignored how that is exactly what you are doing. \n \n \nIf someone killed a relative of mine, I'd want to PERSONALLY throw the switch or put a bullet in their head. An eye for an eye IS justice in some instances.\n It may not be YOUR idea of justice, but it IS mine.\n\n \n Alright. But you're just giving them the ultimate freedom. No more pain, no more suffering, no more hardship, no more earthly demands, no more constantly uncertaintly, no more worrying, no more problems. Doesn't sound like the murderer is even being punished. \n \n \nThat's your opinion and one not shared by many people, including me.\n\n \n An eye for an eye and the whole world goes blind. \n \n \nNo, it isn't. Fiscal responsibility can occur when criminals are locked up (or executed). The crime rate drops, less police are needed, ultimately less jails would be needed, but that's generally not the \"Party Platform\". Republicans are for fiscal responsibility, strong defense and tough law enforcement measurements. The three aren't mutually exclusive if you cut out all of the social engineering programs that are draining our economy.\n\n \n Ignorant. Executing people is costing this country money, lives, and dignity. The crime rate doesn't drop with more penalties, it increases. If you know anything about how these trials are paid for, you would know that counties, counties that are usually in the RED, have to pay for them. They cut social services FIRST, and pressure police to handle the major crimes, not the small crimes. And as any knowledge person knows, without that form of help and enforcement, crime rates go up. If republicans are for fiscal responsibitly, why are republicans voting for Bush? Do you realize it costs more to kill people then the put them away for life? \n \n \nHow many times in recent years have judges ordered prisons to allow some criminals serving time for lesser crimes out due to prison overcrowding?\n \n\n \n Do you even understand how the system in NY works? None of what you say even matters if we applied it to the entire country.",

   "Well, it took me a while, but now I'm convinced that you're no more than a troll. Your only intent with your \"in your face\" attitude is to provoke a negative response.\n\n \n Simply because you fail to understand the word, fail to understand the history, fail to understand your absurdly large amount of fallacies, fail to understand the legal defintion, fail to understand how enforcement in the past has worked in the past, attacked another for his dictionary use while showing your own indept ability to use a dictionary, and that's just for starters. Your own character flaws do not make me a troll. \n \n \nWhen I pointed out examples of a word used in context, you attacked the argument, not the proper use of the word (which was my only reason for incorporating it in the first place).\n\n \n Prevent is NEVER a all encompassing subsitute for deter. You weren't use the proper use of the word, you were using a single word in the defintion as the entire definition. I TALKED THE PIZZA! Does that make sense? Well, talk means to deliver by speech, so Yes, it does, if we use your logic. You should take a look at the fallacious arguments thread in the same forum as the bear defense one. You are using quite a few of them. \n \n \n\n You made several snide comments about my writing abilities, which I may add are superior to your own. Do you ever read what you write? Do you even care?\n\n \n Superior? That's questionable, and utterly arrogant as well. For one who uses a dictiontary that defines the word with the word, that's quite a arrogant and ignorant comment to say. You haven'r proved anything beyond your absolute love for fallacies and your completely contempt for history. If you noticed, I went paragraph by paragraph dissecting and pointing out all of the problems in your arguments. You have selectively read points. Another fallacy to fail to notice. \n \n \n\n And now, in this post, you've called me a blowhard and ignorant because my view of the world doesn't correspond to yours.\n\n \n No, I called you a blowhard because you listed all of your courses in a attempt to prove that you are smarter, and therefore right, another fallacy, what is that? Like the 15th time you've resorted to fallacies. Physics has nothing to do with proving a historical argument. I called you ignorant because you apparently know nothing about history (except mad) nor do you understand the economics of the penalty, nor do you understand how lower crime prevention stops major crimes. All of these you have ignored. \n \n \nToo bad, junior. Get used to it. Life is full of differences, some good, some bad.\n\n \n See above. \n \n \n\n You might want to bone up on your own debating skills, which are severely lacking from my perspective. Name calling rarely wins an argument past the third grade level. \n\n \n Considering you haven't proven anything, constantly selectively read, ignore everything you don't like, don't bother to research, constantly assert that age and \"education\" makes you right without any substance, have used a large number of fallacies, ignore the fact that I have used a phrase exactly like you did, your skills are severely lacking from my persepective. Ignore facts, ignoring points, ignoring history, restorting to fallacies, and ignoring everything you don't like, as well as fabricating argunents rarely wins a arguemnt past 3rd grade. \n \n \n\n And, it is YOU who thinks that everything can be reduced to definite yes/no answers.\n\n \n Prove it. If you can. Considering how weak your arguemnts are (you remind me of \"expert\" creationist) you won't be able to prove that. Notice you can't rise to any challenge I give. You simply ignore them, along with everything else you don't like. \n \n \nI been around enough to know that's not the case. So, before I waste any more time feeding a troll, I'll end my discourse with you and give you a chance to dry out behind the ears before re-engaging again.\n\n \n Once again you resort to the knowledge of the ancients/youth fallacy. I will take you down in every argument. You have a fallacy lover as well as a fabricator. You have ignored so many facts. You have ignored so many points. You haven't proven anything or refuted anything. \n \n I think I'll go make a list of all the fallacies you have used.",

   "Please explain this. Show me some figures on the cost of an execution and the cost of life imprisonment. Base it on a 21 year old criminal whose life expectancy is 50 more years.\n\n \n No problem. \n \n here is data from a internet paper floating around in the internet. \n \n A commission after an extended study came to the conclusion that the cost to execute a convict was far more than the total expenses of life without parole. On average, the commission found execution was 38% more expensive then life without parole. On average, the yearly costs for life without parole total to $22,000 per prisoner. If a prisoner serves the mandatory 60 years, it will cost the state roughly $1.32 million for a single life sentence. While those statistics may seem staggering, what is truly astounding are the statistics from other studies, such as one by North Carolina. That study found that it costs $2.16 million per execution more than the of prosecuting a non-capital punishment case, and a lifetime sentence combined. If you apply that cost to the rest of the nation's executions, the nation has spent over $1 billion on capital punishment since the reinstatement of the penalty via Gregg vs. Georgia in 1976. The Miami Herald estimated that in the state of Florida, the 18 prisoners executed in the fifteen years from 1973 to 1988, cost an average of $3.2 million per convict, totaling $57.6 million. \n However, one must remember that it takes a trial to send a person to death row, and eventually to their final destination. The National Bureau of Economics Research, directed by Katherine Baicker, found that sixteen years of capital punishment trials have costs the nation $1.6 billion dollars. They also found most capital punishment cases fall on a county's budget. Subsequently, the counties that prosecute these cases must balance the high costs, and most cut programs, slash budgets of fire and police departments, and public transportation. However, this is usually not enough, and higher taxes end up balancing the budget. One example of counties balancing their budgets by those methods is Douglas County, Kansas. The residents of the county have a $1.7 million budget deficit. The county has already cut $1.5 million from the budget, which will degrade the quality of programs in the county. On top of that $1.7 million deficit, a capital punishment case is scheduled in that county. Recent estimates of the trial have the total cost ranging into the $2 million price tag. Commissioner Jones was quoted comparing the costs to the trial's results, \"That extra measure of justice or vengeance -- however you want to call it -- is not worth all the sacrifices you'll have to make.\" Clearly the costs of the trial have an impact, enough to make the people wonder if it is truly worth invoking the death penalty. \n Many wonder how is death more expensive than life! Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin's 2002 death penalty case breakdown is as follows: Four prosecutors for the two-month trial, including preparation time totaled $296,000. $34,000 was spent on equipment, presentations for the trial, and expert testimonies. Another $43,000 was allocated for investigators to research the case. $164,000 was paid to one of the defense attorneys. The other three attorneys did not submit their legal fees, but the estimated additional fees top out at $200,000. The jury selection costs the state more than $87,000. The calculated costs add up to $602,000, without overtime pay to deputies. However, this case did not end with a conviction to death row, but only life without parole. This cost is unusually low since Jamil did not go through the multiple appeals that most convicts do when originally given the death sentence. A convict can appeal to his or her state's Supreme Court, then an intermediate court, and finally the US Supreme Court. If Jamil received the death penalty, the low end of his three appeals would total $1.806 million. If he did appeal, the low end of the sum of his appeals plus his first trial total $2.4 million. That total is significantly more than $1.32 million that Indiana's Commission had found for room and board of a life sentence. \n \n Indiana Criminal Law Study Commission, January 10, 2002\n The Costs of Processing Murder Cases in North Carolina, Duke University May 1993 \n Miami Herald, July 10, 1988\n The Budgetary Repercussions of Capital Convictions\n Lawrence Journal World, February 3, 2003\n Atlanta Journal-Constitution, May 12, 2002\n \n\n Also, please explain how the Supreme Court can logically back up a claim that capital punishment is not a deterrent to capital crime.\n\n \n \"Although some of the studies suggest that the death penalty may not function as a significantly greater deterrent than lesser penalties, there is no convincing empirical evidence supporting or refuting this view.\"\n \n Gregg vs. Georgia, Supreme Court Of The United States, 428 U.S. 153, March 31, 1976\n \n That and countries without the penalty have substantially lower crime rates.

   "Emclean: Oh but it is about cost. The trial of one alleged criminal will likely cost many other families the lives of their loved ones. That is unacceptable in almost every case and notion to me. We do not kill people to ensure that more innocents are murder. \n \n \nin your opinion, life in a cage, or death?\n\n \n That refers to our current system, one I do not support. \n \n \nSo you are comparing incarceration to the costs of prosecution and conviction for capital crimes, not just the execution.\n\n \n Because that is what seperates the costs in between the two. If we ran our system like Saudi Arabia, I wouldn't have made the argument. You cannot ignore the costs of the trial to suit your argument. \n \n \nI noted in an article regarding the cost of the death penalty in California that a capital trial costs $1,898,323.00 while a non-capital trial costs $627,322.00.\n\n \n So you admit that it does cost more. Not like that's up for discussion anyway. \n \n \n\n The bulk of the increased cost goes to the lawyers, investigators, the court and the jail. True, some of this is taxpayer money, but it's being recirculated through payrolls and redistributed as taxable income, so it's really not that expensive.\n\n \n While the divided example mentioned in the long economics explantion I posted does sort of support your argument, it only does on the surface level. The other examples I posted cost significently more, to the point of a million or more. True, the money does go back into the system as tax, but it is not being kept in the county/state and being spent as it normally would be. The key to stopping violent crimes is to enforce a Draconian rule of lower laws. NY tried this and succeeded beyond their most wild dreams. Violent crimes dropped more then 50%. Not to mention that many killers start off disturbed, and can easily be helped early through proper social services. The money that is spent on trials is not spent on those two fundemental cutters of violent crimes. So in reality it not only costs more, but it only ensure more innocent blood to be spilled. \n \n \nThe execution itself costs far less than incarceration. I have made a standing offer to perform executions for $250.00 a head (group rates available) and that includes burial at sea.\n\n \n Then we abandon many civil rights, including due process of law. Like I said, it would be cheaper if we ran our system like Saudi Arabia, but we don't, nor should we, that's if we consider our society civilized.",
