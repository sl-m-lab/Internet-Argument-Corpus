From what I've heard, they believe he likely used a 9mm. I just keep thinking of what a monster this guy is/was - how many times he shot his entire magazine, reloaded, and continued to kill and injure more people.\n \n I know some people who go to school there - I've been able to contact most of them (one was actually walking to class when she heard a bunch of gunshots), but I haven't been able to get in touch with one that would probably have been in the Engineering building (where the shooting took place), so I'm a little worried about that.\n \n EDIT: Apparently it is not only the largest school shooting in US history, it is now the largest shooting period.",

   "**\n Watching TV coverage of the massacre and aftermath (the murdered Canadian was a French teacher lived for many years in Nova Scotia, in the same town I once lived in, and from which 2-3 ? exchange students are now at WVT. ), and I cannot help but reflect on how very predictable the public statements made by politicians, especially \n US politicians, always are under these circumstances.\n \n This governor of W. V. takes the cake, however, and truly turns my stomach.\n First, he repeatedly makes it \"all about me\" in faux Steven Colbert fashion, by prefacing his speeches with the bit that he was away on important business (the usual 'trade' junket), had to wait for hours for a flight, then came straight back home. I should think that that would be an unstated given, but he apparently thinks it the important 'lead in' to this 'story', in view of Giuliani's political popularity for showing up at 'ground zero' when Bush was invisible, and Bush's unpopularity when he was slow to \"photo op\" New Orleans.\n \n Second, this fundamentalist preacher cum latin- american 'missionary/evangelist' cum bible-belt politician gets totally smarmy, pious, and holier-than-thou when people mention that the psycho who murdered over thirty people did so because he could, and he could because of the slack, (FAPP non-existent), state gun control laws that are his, i.e., the governor's, responsibility. To cover up his own responsibility for this latest blood-bath of innocents, this smarmy jerk blustered and lashed out, calling anyone who asked, \"How did this maniac lay hands on such terrible weapons?\", a bunch of disgusting, loathsome creatures trying to make political hay from a very sad tragedy, -- one for which we should not be angry, but only sob and sigh and pray about.\n \n Of course Bush also got on the 'prayer and sorrow' spin train, reciting his standard sermon. Funny how, every time any politician in the USA speaks, but especielly when the speech concerns death and destruction, any foreign listener (such as myself) feels transported to some back-water bible camp or tent revival, with an itinerant evangelical preacher on screen, and not a member of the governing leadership of 'the last remaining superpower'.\n \n On final note, this is just the latest gun-enabled massacre. After the smoke clears and all the smarmy pious platitudes have gone with the wind, some other psycho will stroll into a 'gun show' and walk off with a 50 cal. sniper rifle, a machine gun, or a brace of 9mm Glock autos. And another after him and then another and another. Because religious right-wing regressive conservatives, like this 'governor garbage-head', think that life in the USA should be that way, forever.\n Guns do kill people, because PEOPLE WITH GUNS CAN AND DO KILL fAR MORE PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE WITHOUT GUNS DO. Especially the brutal and crazy ones.\n \n WW",

Heck, boxcutters enabled 19 men to kill 3000+. Some deisel fuel and fertilizer was used by 3 men to kill ~140 in OK City. The point is, if you want to kill a large group of people, guns are not the only option. Besides, you can ban every gun from the general civilian population, and criminals and people with the intent to kill with a gun will still get them. At least if more people were armed, they would have a fighting chance when it comes to situations like this. Banning guns in the US will ensure that only criminals are armed with them. That is a completely dangerous idea. Banning guns is not the answer to stopping mass killings. \n \n Obviously, we missed something with this man. It is being stated that he has a history of mental illness, and had been committed involuntarily to a mental health crisis center at least once. This should set off red flags when someone attempts to purchase a firearm. Is that something we can take from this tragedy and learn from, hopefully using this lesson to prevent future incidents?

   "I think the point most Yanks mis is that if no one had a gun there would have been no massacre in the first place. In stead a lot of pro gun Americans argue that arming citizens to the teeth would deter crime. While probably true against toilet-paper-and-egg-throwing hoodlums, nut-jobs like Cho probably fancy the idea of having a shoot out with his victims. Guys like this aim to go down in a blaze of glory. \n \n The problem is not the hardened criminal who can get his hands on a gun anyway, but that school shootings most of the time involve nut jobs who purchased their guns at a local arms dealer or got them from their (shortsighted) parents.\n [*]The argument that criminals always find a way doesn't hold because the shooter at VT was not a criminal but a shy student who had not a chance in hell acquiring a weapon illegally. (at least not in a country with strict gun control regulations)[*]The argument that uniform gun possession would have deterred the kid from doing this is highly speculative because at the moment no one knows what was going trough his head. He might as well have looked forward to the confrontation.[*]The argument that the number of deaths could have been lower if anyone else carried at gun is also not a strong one because then their would have been a shoot-out between a prepared gun-man and a shocked kid, probably resulting in even more dead.[*]Guns don't kill people, people do. This one is great. First of all, it changes the ground of the discussion with a statement which is true but is completely out of place in the discussion. Furthermore the fact that killing people is already strictly legislated doesn't help the discussion as it is. If you look at this argument for two seconds you can see that it's goal is to distract you from the problem at hand by looking at a fact everyone has to agree with and thereby allowing no further discussion. If you change the word \"guns\" in this famous one liner, say to \"bananas\", it becomes clear that, for the argument, it's totally unimportant what the word is. You can insert \"Thermo Nuclear Weaponry\" if you want to carry the MAD-doctrine to the streets or \"cigarettes\" if you're defending a tobacco company in a lawsuit.\n The fact that people DO kill, makes it all more important to deny them the responsibility of destructive power.

The problem is, at 35,000 feet the partial pressure of oxygen is too low to allow for adequate absorption of oxygen which will lead to hypoxia; unconsciousness; and eventually death.

I DON'T ADVOCATE THIS AT ALL, but a kid I knew in high school bought some arms from the black market. When I found out, I turned him in (knowing, both of us, that my house contained enough firearms for my protection), but my point is that he got those arms illegally easier than I did legally. If guns had been banned, he still could have gotten his arms, but everyone else would then be under him. This means that excessive gun control causes a social elite, one of criminals and law-breakers. Oh wait, nevermind, the almighty government is their to protect us, just like France protected its people in WWII, or N. Vietnam does, or the USSR did, or Hitler's Germany did. I quote Thomas Jefferson: \"No FREE man shall EVER be barred the use of arms.\" I now quote Vladimir Lenin: \"A system of licensing and registration is the perfect device to deny gun ownership to the bourgeoisie.\" Who exactly is creating a social elite?",
