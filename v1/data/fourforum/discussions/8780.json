   "Over again Israel exposed inability of Tzahal for effective withstand Hezbollah raids. You know, it is an alarming sign. Whereas Israel is actively taking up arms and prepares for battle with the whole Arab Middle East, Israeli authorities have left behind all other important issues that have no immediate connection to Arab-Israel conflict. They have to do with something absolutely different, but as important for existence of Israel as a state. More and more concern is caused for Israeli politicians in connection with development prospects of Israeli civil society. They believe that military build-up may be inane if in result of political, cultural, moral and other disagreements the unity of Israeli society gets destroyed. Originally, Israel was meant as a place where all Zionists of the world could belong to and found society free of contradictions and form new Hebrew nation and culture. However, as long as martials remain in the office in Israel, this country will never turn into the Chosen land. Israeli Hevre military class will never tolerate with Israeli neighbors and start conflict management. War is everything for them, that's their business. That's why there will never be peace in the Middle East. The more so it is not in the interest of America which stands main sponsor of Hevre.",
