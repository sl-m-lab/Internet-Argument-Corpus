   "Here are some hypotheticals which isolate some issues that are fun to think about<b></b>:\n \n 1) Bob and Tom are siamese twins. Bob is fully formed but Tom's heart does not pump enough blood for him to survive independently of Bob. Bob is suffering under the physical and mental strain of supporting Tom's body and decides that he no longer wants to be attatched to Tom. \n \n Does Bob have the right to detach himself from Tom ?\n \n \n 2) You are at fault in a car accident that causes an innocent woman to suffer a double kidney failure. You are the only compatible donor availbale to donate a kidney in time to save her life. Your decision to accept the risks of driving has forced an innocent life to depend on you and the use of one of your organs to live. \n \n Should the government be able to force you to donate your kidney? \n Should you be convicted of murder if you don't provide the kidney?\n \n \n 3) Pat has a condition called \"chimerism\" which is the result of two zygotes becoming fused during development in the womb - somewhat like siamese twins, but the two sets of genetically-distinct cell populations in the body are highly integrated. In Pat's case each zygote was of a different sex and as a result, Pat is not only made-up of two genetically distinct people, but one of them is male and the other female.\n \n Pat's brain is composed of the female cell line and decides to undergo medical treatment that would remove the male genitalia from the male person in Pat's body and replace those areas with female physical features.\n \n Should the government step-in to prevent this operation in order to protect the male person that is part of, but distict from Pat?\n \n \n \n --",

   "Does Bob have the right to detach himself from Tom ?\n I think the real question is not detaching but killing. You don't detach a fetus during an abortion..you just kill the fetus (or embryo) and suck it out. I am not sure Tom is for any of that.\n \n But if Tom would die, then no...Bob has no right to detach...in fact, probably no right even if he wouldn't die.\n \n \n \nShould the government be able to force you to donate your kidney?\n Should you be convicted of murder if you don't provide the kidney?\n Doesn't really relate to abortion that well but 1) the government shouldn't force you to donate and 2) you are never convicted of murder in a driving accident but an man-slaughter type of charges should apply if the driver was drunk or clearly doing something to endanger a life (as opposed to an accident caused by trying to dodge a deer and then hitting the other car).\n \n As for number 3...I got no idea what you are talking about here :)",

Bob is suffering under the physical and mental strain of supporting Tom's body and decides that he no longer wants to be attatched to Tom. \n \n Does Bob have the right to detach himself from Tom ?\n\n \n Morally, it would be highly reproachable for Bob to separate himself from Tom, since he (and only he) can sustain Tom's life, and so separation would inevitably bring about Tom's death. Legally, however, I don't know if there are enough theoretical grounds to support a law that would force Bob to stay attatched to Tom. After all, what the law wants is simply good citizens (respectful with others' rights), not good people (generous and willing to sacrifice their health and comfort for others). I know it's something worth fighting for, but you cannot legally force anyone to sacrifice their rights for others. This is a very difficult question, perhaps I'm wrong.\n \n Also, as Steeeeve said, this is different from abortion. First of all, because Tom and Bob's situation is exceptional, and cannot be taken to formulate a rule. Pregnancy, however, is the most normal way to have children, so it is normal (and thus worthy of legal protection) for mothers to sacrifice some of their health and comfort for their babies. Secondly, Bob had nothing to do with Tom being dependant of him, while pregnancy is the result of the mother's actions (except of course in a case of rape).\n \n \n \n2) You are at fault in a car accident that causes an innocent woman to suffer a double kidney failure. You are the only compatible donor availbale to donate a kidney in time to save her life.

However, the second question is more complicated. I come from a European legal system, in which it wouldn't be entirely outrageous for you to be convicted of murder in this case. It depends on how the accident took place, if you were driving with a manifest unconcern for the life and physical integrity of others. In this case, I would not criticise a conviction of murder, but for the accident, not for the denial to give the kidney. If the accident took place fortuitously, then you could be convicted for what we here call and \"imprudent\" crime, in this case an imprudent murder, which has a shorter sentence.\n \n \n3) Pat has a condition called \"chimerism\" which is the result of two zygotes becoming fused during development in the womb - somewhat like siamese twins, but the two sets of genetically-distinct cell populations in the body are highly integrated.

   "Another opinion", 
   "1) Bob and Tom are siamese twins. Bob is fully formed but Tom's heart does not pump enough blood for him to survive independently of Bob. Bob is suffering under the physical and mental strain of supporting Tom's body and decides that he no longer wants to be attatched to Tom. \n \n Does Bob have the right to detach himself from Tom ?\n\n First, I assume that both Bob and Tom have functioning brains so that both are \"people\" in the sense of not only being human, but also of having a mind (a mental existence). Then, I would think that the ultimate right belongs to the person who \"owns\" the body. If Tom and Bob are sufficiently separate and Tom is essentially in the position of being an innocent parasite on Bob, then Bob really does have the right to disconnect himself. It is Bob's choice whether or not to sacrifice himself for Tom. He did not choose to connect himself - he made no such committment. One would want Bob to love his brother enough to make such a big sacrifice to keep Tom alive, but that is a huge sacrifice that one cannot EXPECT people to make. Altruism can be a wonderful, highly admirable quality but it should not be EXPECTED. \n \n However, if Bob and Tom share a crucial part of a joined body (where one cannot say that it is either Tom's or Bob's) then Bob would not have the right to detach himself unless he is willing to sacrifice the joined part of the body.\n \n2) You are at fault in a car accident that causes an innocent woman to suffer a double kidney failure. You are the only compatible donor availbale to donate a kidney in time to save her life. Your decision to accept the risks of driving has forced an innocent life to depend on you and the use of one of your organs to live. \n \n Should the government be able to force you to donate your kidney? \n Should you be convicted of murder if you don't provide the kidney?\n\n Your liability in this case should be only the fact that you are at fault in the car accident. You are subject to any legal ramifications of potential criminal negligence and you are subject to potential lawsuits, but the law should not require you to donate a kidney. You can choose to donate that kidney either out of a sense of responsibility for the accident or out of desire to trade that kidney for reduced liability or sentence, but it should be beyond the rule of law to force one to make that sacrifice.\n \n3) Pat has a condition called \"chimerism\" which is the result of two zygotes becoming fused during development in the womb - somewhat like siamese twins, but the two sets of genetically-distinct cell populations in the body are highly integrated.

If there is only one brain and one mind then, in my view, there is really only one person who gets to do whatever she/he wants with her/his body. Essentially, her body has both female and male elements in it and she can do whatever she wants with those male elements since there is no male mind that can claim right to them.",
