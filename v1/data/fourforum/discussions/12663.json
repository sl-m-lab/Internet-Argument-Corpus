   "It is quite obvious that GFZ are not working. They should be called Victim Killing Zones. Otherwise we'd be hearing the success trumpeted in the leftard media. It is so obvious to all but the most dim witted that we even have a new term added to our vocabulary, \"going postal.\" The Israelis tryed the GFZ for a while until the first Palistinian assault on such a soft target. They quickly repealed them. Of course our leftists aren't quite that bright. The liberal leftist mantra is its not working because either it doesn't have enough money or we are not doing enough of it. \n \n My question is are the left willing to compromise and repeal the Gun Free Zones?",
