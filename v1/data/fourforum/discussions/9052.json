Did I mention that he breathes through his mouth and that his knuckles drag on the ground when he walks?\n\n \n Actually, the concept of habeus corpus goes back much further than you believe, it was just named \"habeus corpus\" about 1000 years ago. the concept itself, if not the name, goes back to the ME, and predates christianity by a long shot. There has been a concept of a \"right\" to habeus corpus as long as there has been a concept of detainment as a punishment. \n \n The earliest evidence we have of \"prisons\" dates back to the Sumarians (2000 BC) and we know that even then, a prisoner had the right to challenge their imprisonment before a council.\n \n Ever since, there has been a \"right\" of habeus corpus in ALL free societies and MOST totalitarian ones. Even the most vicious of tyrants has typically preferred not to take on the concept of habeus corpus head on. People just don't seem to like the idea that they can be disapeared off the planet to some dank prison without recourse.",
