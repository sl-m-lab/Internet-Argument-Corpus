   "As I hear our British authority plans to reduce our military contingent in Iraq from 8,5 to 3 thousand soldiers. How quick we've conceded this point! Wherever is our vaunted strength and heroism? In fact we own to full defeat. We cultivate terrorism, demonstrating our vulnerability instead of trampling on foe. As the phrase goes, business is business. And of course, behaviour of that sort will not recommend us. Moreover, it provokes new claims on the part of Islam terrorism and, thus ... new acts of terror on our territory.\n \n ___________\n Any war is a time of tribulation",
