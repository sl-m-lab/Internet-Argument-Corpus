I personally think its ogood that hes an individual and not like too many other ppl. So what do u think?\n\n \n Individualism is a good thing. I can see where the presentation the school is trying to make for itself could make the principle not want to allow the picture in the year book but there should have been rules in place for that before the incident happened. Presumably he was allowed to have the mohawk around school but not just in the year book, correct? If so it sounds like a stupid rule to me, but it is a private school and I guess they can make whatever rules they wish.",

So what do u think?\n\n \n Personally, I think individual expression is important to God and God might actually like the idea. However, since it is a private school, the student in question agreed to follow the rules, including the dictates of a prudish principal. In other words, if I was the prinicpal it would be fine with me for him to have a mohawk but since I am not, I would support the prinicpal on principle.",
