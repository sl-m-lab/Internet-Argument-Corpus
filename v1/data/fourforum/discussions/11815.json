What you wrote is anything but. You've received too many robo calls or listen too much to right wing pundants.\n \n So, you graduated from Harvard? \n \n How does he want to appease terrorists? By talking to them rather than starting a war with them as the current president? Yea, if we talk to them, next thing you know they'll own the US because democrats can't think beyond their nose. No one can think in this country but misquoting right winging bible-believing thumpers who will say anything or print anything to get elected.\n \n \"Meaningless historical facts\" . . . .\"what affairs they've had\" Until it was Clinton. Talk about hippocrites!\n \n Well the ride is over as of next Tuesday. The socialists will take back the country, stop fighting a war based on lies, tax the ones who can afford it and look out for all the citizens. And if we're really lucky, restore a good name back to the United States of America.\n \n You're a trip!",

   "You righties are really desperate if character assassination is all you have with less than a week to go.\n \n Better get used to media saying \"President Obama.\"\nYou got that right, you fellow socialist.\n \n For the past couple of weeks (or longer) all McCain and his pit bull with lipstick have done is mount an aggressive campaign against Obama with lies and half-truths at best. Why? Because they have nothing to say about their own programs. No one is interested. . . . .well, not the majority of thinkers anyway.\n \n The US couldn't be in much worse shape than it is right now because of a stubborn dufus in the white house. We lefties socialists 1diots said it 8 years ago when he was elected. He ruined the Texas Rangers, bankrupted them and the right wing and Jerry Falwell, Limbaugh, O'Rielly, Hannity, et. al. thought he could run the country. Well, you showed us didn't you?\n \n The right wing wants to elect another one just like him. OMG How crazy can we possibly be? He calls himself a mavrick and all of a sudden, with a unique title, he's the man. There are truly crazy people in this country who have been in charge much too long. Choice be known, I'm, proud to be a socialist  emoticon_xagree who has compassion for his fellow human beings, even the wrong ones. I know, an unpopular concept but anyway.",
