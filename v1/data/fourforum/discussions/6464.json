   "WEEK 3 PREDICTIONS - Courtesy of the Stone\n \n Atlanta at Buffalo - Atlanta. Seriously, it's just the Bills.\n Cincinnati at Chicago - Da' Bears lose, big time.\n Tampa bay at Green Bay - Farve goes home crying as Tampa makes an interception to end the game.\n Cleveland at Indianapolis - Manning throws for 4 touchdowns in a romp over the Browns.\n Carolina at Miami - Carolina defense shuts down Linehan, proving Linehan is way overpaid for an OC\n New Orleans at Minnesota - Vikes rebound and prove critics wrong that Randy Moss is still an Issue\n Jacksonville at New York Jets - The Jags give Pennington more excues to complain as they win a close one.\n Oakland at Philadelphia - Randy walks off the field with 2 seconds left . . . in the third quarter. Eagles\n Tennessee at St. Louis - Greatest show on turf nudges out a close win. Rams in OT\n Dallas at San Francisco - Big Tuna's pregame a**chewing backfires, 49ers light up the scoreboard\n Arizona at Seattle - Seattle easily. Seriously, it's Arizona. Not even Green can resurrect the Cardinals\n New England at Pittsburgh - Toss up, great game. But I love Big Ben. Pittsburgh in a very close game\n New York Giants at San Diego - This actually is a road game for the Giants, San Diego rolls to an easy win. Manning goes home crying.\n Kansas City at Denver - Best rivalry game of the week, Broncos win a close one, Priest Homles gets injured. Final Score KC 27 - Denver 24 (thats 51 points)\n \n AFC Player of the Week - Payton Manning. He throws way to many touchdowns\n NFC Player of the Week - Dante Culpepper. Taking last week as a personal insult, he comes out of the tunnel breathing smoke and throwing fire. 3 touchdown, 0 ints, 0 fumbles, 350 yards passing and 75% completion percentage\n \n Feel free to comment if I have offended anyone out there. Seriously though, I am Right. I have a new commercial coming out this weekend with the Psychic Friends Network.\n \n Courtesy of the Stone at www.viking-insiders.com",
