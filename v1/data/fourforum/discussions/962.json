How does it define species? \n \"Species The basic unit of biological classification; members of a species are capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring\"(p367)\" \n\n Text book of what? How is it relevant and why should that definition be more meaningful that any other?\n \nIt seemed logical to me once, the idea of macro-evolution. Let us suppose we have a species called \"X\". If over a period of time the population became split by distance, we could call them \"X-1\" and \"X-2\". Again, over a period of time, changes may have happened in one group, through mutations, so that \"X-1\" may have changed so much that if the two populations were ever re-united, they'd be unable to inter-breed... thus they'd be two distinct species. Evolutionaries call this Sympatric Speciation.\n\n Actually, mutations accumulate in both populations.\n \nBUT... how about birds? Any mutation that may have happened in any one bird or group of birds, would work its way around the entire population.\n\n Why? If they are separated, how would the gene spread?\n \nHow then does a species speciate?\n\n By the accumulation of genetic diversity in populations.\n \n\"Some evolutionary biologists don't believe that it (Sympatric Speciation) ever occurs. They feel that interbreeding would soon eliminate any genetic differences that might appear.\"\n\n Wouldn't it be nice if you learned to mark you quotes with quotation marks instead of question marks? And the next line on the page that you quoted says, \"But there is some compelling (albeit indirect) evidence that sympatric speciation can occur.\"\n \nEven small changes would be inherited...\n\n Of course they would. That's what evolution is, the inheritence of genetic changes. That was one of your finer examples of non-thought.\n \nIf we are to believe in survival of the fittest, the difficulties that arise are more abundant.\n\n Then I guess that it is a good thing that the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" isn't descriptive of natural selection. The phrase was coined by Herbert Spencer, not Charles Darwin. Spencer was a social philosopher and had written about evolution by means of inheritance of acquired characteristics before Darwin (and Wallace) had made their theory known. Darwin didn't like the phrase and objected to it's application to his theory. For some reason Wallace thought it apt and convinced Darwin to use it. Darwin finally did in the 4th edition of On the Origin of Species, although he always, without exception, linked it with his own name for the theory, \"natural selection.\"\n \n But if you want to worry about difficulties, perhaps you should consider that they arise because you aren't talking about Darwin's theory, but Spencer's.\n \nIf a particular animal had a beneficial mutation, it may not necessarily be able to breed to pass that on... it might have the ability to digest a new type of food, but it may be too small to compete against a larger male.\n\n I see. You are claiming that this is the case with every single beneficial mutation in every species through all time? If that is not what you are saying, then what is your point? Suppose what you say is true half the time. Then the gene gets passed on half the time. And what if the mutation occurs in the larger male?\n \nThe chance of a particular animal getting eaten without ever having mated is also another factor.\n\n Again, do you have a point? Are you again asserting that ever beneficial mutation will occur in an animal that will be eaten befor it has mated in every case?\n \nSurvival of the 'fittest' is not always the case anyway.\n\n I'm glad you realize that.\n \nIf you have two large male deer butting heads against each other, you might think... the strongest will win, and pass on his genes. However, sometimes the deer's horns inter-lock and if they can't separate they die. So, a cowardly weak deer that stood by on the side-lines would be able to mate. Survival of the cowardly and weak comes into play.\n\n Well, since you used the word \"sometimes\" I assume you realize that this isn't the case all the time. Sometimes the stronger deer actually does win. So what is your point?\n \nLikewise, turtles produce dozens of eggs. When they hatch, they run the gauntlet of a plethora of predatory birds. One of these turtles may have some mutation that could one day benefit its species, but is picked-off by a gull. It seems to me that this is survival of the luckiest is now a factor to be considered.\n\n It seems that you don't understand the theory that you claim you oppose. How can you oppose it if you don't even know what it is. Natural selection never has been a statement that only the strong survive. Darwin thought that \"survival of the fittest\" misrepresented what he intended. And since you have obviously never read Darwin's theory or any detailed treatment of it, you have clearly misunderstood.\n \n Natural selection is differential reproductive success. Those organisms that are well adapted to their environment tend to survive to reproduce in greater numbers, and therefore they tend to produce more offspring, than those organisms that are less well adapted.",

The short answer is that one cannot. (Recall the case of the Laysan and Nihoa Telespyza.) The word ?potentially? was dropped from some later versions of the biological species concept in response to this criticism, but the notion of potential ability to interbreed is still implicit in the biological species concept: the Blue Jays in North Carolina do not in fact interbreed with Blue Jays in Wisconsin today (no population is instantaneously panmictic), but we include them all in the same biological species because we assume they have the potential to do so.\" (Ibid)\n \n So, if Darwin's Finch can interbreed, isn't that a case that it is the same species?",

   "\"From time to time, attacks on neo-Darwinism are mounted, usually by persons who either see evolutionary theory as antireligious or who basically misunderstand Darwin's theory. One attack, entitled \"Darwin's Mistakes,\" by Tom Bethell, was published in Harper's magazine.\n Bethell began by pointing out that Darwinian theory is a tautology rather than a predicative theory. (The term tautology means a statement that is true by definition.)* That is, evolution is the survival of the fittest. But who are the fittest? Obviously, the individuals who survive. Thus, without an independent criterion for fitness, other than survival, we are left with the statement that evolution is the survival of the survivors. This indeed is a tautology. But it is possible to assign independent criteria for fitness. Darwin wrote extensively about artificial selection in pigeons, in which the breeders' choice was the criterion for fitness. (Many novel breeds of pigeon have been created this way.) Artificial selection has been practiced extensively by plant and animal breeders. Here too, survival is not the criterion for fitness, productivity is.\"\n Robert H Tamarin, (1996) \"Principles of Genetics\" (5th ed), p571.\n \n So, why are they still teaching this rubbish?\n \n The example used is of artificial survival! Where in nature does nature produce a cow that would die, unless it was milked twice a day? It doesn't because the cow would die!\n \n \"Possible to assign criteria...\" where does nature do this?\n \n In other words their proof of survival of the fittest not being a tautology comes not from nature, but from creative and intelligent design!\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n *Yes, and no...\n tau\u00b7tol\u00b7o\u00b7gy \n n. pl. tau\u00b7tol\u00b7o\u00b7gies\n Needless repetition of the same sense in different words; redundancy.\n An instance of such repetition.\n Logic.
