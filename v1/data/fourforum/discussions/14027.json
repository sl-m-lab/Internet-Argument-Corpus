   "This came out back in December, but it's still spot on on just what this atrocity called Obamacare is set to do: From: Virtual Anarchy\n \n WOW!! Let's hear it for the Judge! The article is in the Marble Falls, Texas newspaper. It was written by a former county judge, David Kithil. He voiced his opposition to HB 3200, and gave EXACT SPECIFICS, to include page and paragraph in the bill on why this Health Bill is BAD.\n \n Thomas Edwards, Editor of the River Cities Tribune, was called to get legal permission to quote David Kithil's comments. He gave me that permission, so I can quote him. \n \n Here are excerpts from the article, giving EXACT pages and paragraphs in the bill and why it is so bad. You can forward this to all of your addressees. I think he hits everything right on the head and the opposition you may encounter cannot argue over these points: \n \n JUDGE KITHIL: \"I have reviewed selected sections of the bill and find it unbelievable that our Congress, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, could come up with a bill loaded with so many wrong-headed elements. We do need to reform the health insurance system in America in order to make coverage affordable and available to everyone. But, how many of us believe our federal government can manage a new program any better than the bankrupt Medicare program or the underfunded Social Security program? Both Republicans and Democrats are equally responsible for the financial mess of those two programs. \n \n I am opposed to HB 3200 for a number of reasons. To start with, it is estimated that a federal bureaucracy of more than 150,000 new employees will be required to administer HB3200. That is an unacceptable expansion of a government that is already too intrusive in our lives. If we are going to hire 150,000 new employees, let's put them to work protecting our borders, fighting the massive drug problem and putting more law enforcement/firefighters out there.\"\n \n NOW, here comes the good stuff: \"Other problems I have with this bill include: \n \n Page 50/section 152: The bill will provide insurance to all non-U.S. residents, even if they are here illegally. \n \n Page 58 and 59: The government will have real-time access to an individual's bank account and will have the authority to make electronic fund transfers from those accounts.  Italics mine.\n \n Page 65/section 164: The plan will be subsidized (by the government) for all union members, union retirees and for community organizations (such as the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now - ACORN). \n \n Page 203/line 14-15: The tax imposed under this section will not be treated as a tax. (How could anybody in their right mind come up with that?) \n \n Page 241 and 253: Doctors will all be paid the same regardless of specialty, and the government will set all doctors' fees. \n \n Page 272, section 1145: Cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age. \n \n Page 317 and 321: The government will impose a prohibition on hospital expansion; however, communities may petition for an exception. \n \n Page 425, line 4-12: The government mandates advance-care planning consultations. Those on Social Security will be required to attend an \"end-of-life planning\" seminar every five years. \n \n Page 429, line 13-25: The government will specify which doctors can write an end-of-life order.\" \n \n HAD ENOUGH???? Judge Kithil then goes on: \"Finally, it is specifically stated this bill will not apply to members of Congress. Members of Congress are already exempt from the Social Security system and have a well-funded private plan that covers their retirement needs. If they were on our Social Security plan, I believe they would find a very quick \"fix\" to make the plan financially sound for the future.\"\n \n Honorable David Kithil - Marble Falls, Texas\n \n Thanks to those of you who have submitted items for this blog...\n \n Until next time...\n \n Socialist governments traditionally do make a financial mess. They always run out of other peoples' money...Margret Thatcher\n \n The welfare of humanity is always the alibi of tyrants...Camus\n \n A government big enough to give you everything you want, is big enough to take away everything you have...Thomas Jefferson\n \n Change does not necessarily assure progress...Henry S. Commager\n \n Somewhere in Kenya or Indonesia is a village which has lost its XXXXX ... unknown",
