   "I have a question relative to the timing of Biblical events that perhaps a YEC or Hovindite could answer for me.\n \n Last weekend I saw \"Treasures from the ROYAL TOMBS of UR,\" A Traveling Exhibition Organized by the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at the Houston Museum of Natural History. Ur was a city in Sumer, in the southern part of ancient Mesopotamia, in what is now Iraq. The tombs were excavated in the 1920s and 1930s. You may remember that Ur of Chaldees was the home of the Biblical patriarch Abraham.\n \n These tombs, about 600 of them, date to the middle of the third millennium B.C. The information in the display dated them to around 2600 B.C. and mentioned that Abraham lived there around 2100 B.c.\n \n Here's my question. Many evangelists claim that there was a global flood only 4500 years ago. If any of you are familiar with the lectures by Mr. Kent Hovind, you will have heard him claim over and over that there was a great flood 4500 years ago. That would place the flood after the date of the building of the tombs of UR (also around the time that pyramids were being built in Egypt), and well after the establishment of the civilizations of Mesopotamia, and only 400 years before Abraham lived.\n \n My question is, how did the flood that covered the mountains to a depth of 15 cubits not affect the Sumerian city of Ur, other cities of Mesopotamia, and the pyramids of Egypt?",

I'm not saying that because I disagree with him theologically, I'm saying that cuz he says things like:\n \n *Satan is using the theory of evolution to bring about his new world order and this new world order has black uniforms and a fleet of black helicopters\n \n *Satan will establish a new world order through UPC symbols \n \n *UFOs are apparitions of Satan\n \n *Evolution is the philosophy behind communism, nazism, and racism\n \n *Teaching of evolution in public schools is how the new world order is to brainwash the youth of America, to prime them for the one world government. Evolution is the cause of suicide, teenage pregnancy, teenage abortion, murders, violent crime, drug use, and just about any social ill you can think of.\n \n *There were over 20,000 sightings of dinosaurs in the 20th century\n \n Some of you are thinking, \"This is a joke right?\" Sadly, it is not. Check it out for yourself if you don't believe me.",

Neither civilisation got washed away. The Sumerian \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" includes a prototype of the flood story but that is as close as you'll get to any point of common reference.

But for some reason, that doesn't bother biblical literalists. Some have claimed that since the destruction of the Pharaoh and his army would have been an embarrassment for the Egyptians, they would have destroyed all records of the Hebrews, the Pharaoh, and the Army. Trouble with that is that they weren't very successful in such attempts to erase history in other cases, so one wonders how they could have been so spectacularly successful in this case.",
