I see no way the federal government can force states to marry gays. However, the constitution does say that states must recognize the legal proceedings of other states. That would mean that if two gays get legally married in one state no state can say they won't recognize the marriage. Currently, for this to get settled, two gays will have to get married in Masschusetts, which would mean they would have to be citizens of Massachusetts; they aren't marrying out of state gays. Then that couple would have to move to a state that didn't recognize gay marriage and try to claim a right reserved for married people, like filing taxes jointly. When they're denied they would then sue the state, and things would then work their way up the judicial chain of command (is there a better phrase?) until it reached the Supreme Court.\n \n So in summary, the Supreme Court couldn't strike down a state amendment that simply said that state wouldn't marry gays, but it could strike down an amendment that says they won't recognize gay marriage at all, once someone brings the case before them.",
