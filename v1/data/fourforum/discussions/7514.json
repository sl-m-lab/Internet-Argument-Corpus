   "As explained by one of the participants in gas delivery negotiations between Tbilisi, Baku and Tehran, Mikhail Saakashvili - who is widely renowned for his inadequate and XXXXX behavior - has arrived at his own solution for energy security of Georgia. \n \n Being aggrieved about decrease in financial support from Washington planned for year 2006, Georgia's President has exchanged 50 percent control over strategic gas transmission pipeline Transcaucasia for Iranian gas! That's the secret of the quick transaction between Georgia and Iran! \n \n This might sound ridiculous but the other 50 percent control belongs to... Americans - Saakashvili's uncle Alasania serves as a dummy of the US. So this makes sort of American-Iranian company. \n \n Condi Rice was merely in fury after she discussed \"energy security issues\" with Saakashvili 'cause now Tehran has got one more instrument of political leverage upon its enemy America, which is decisive in the view that Washington fails to settled nuclear dispute with Iran. \n \n As far as I know, officials in Washington are likely to impose a responsibility for such a turn-up on State Secretary as it was she who insisted on cutting of allocations for Georgian \"democrats\".",
