   "I have seen that topic in a lot of forums, then when I click on it, the author complains about Obama and Clinton. There are more than two people running for the Democratic primaries. It seems that every year we elect the president with the biggest campaign funding. I think that this is an injustice, I encourage everyone to look at the little guys too. Kucinich, for example, has an excellent track record and experience on his resume. He has been in politics for decades and has made the right choices on major issues consistently. He has been against Iraq from the start, and is the only person from Congress who voted against invading Iraq who is running. Unfortunately, he is strong on worker's rights and therefore is looked down upon by large coorporations, taking away funding. I urge America to not let the white house be bought again, look at everyone, not just Obama and Clinton.",
