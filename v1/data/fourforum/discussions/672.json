Well, maybe it is harder than i think but nobody should be getting that much money while there are people living on park benches! and they get like 10,000 dollar gift packages for comming to those award shows...yea like they need it!\n\n \n My wife enjoys ET and shows like this where the stars flaunt their worldly possessions. They are oblivious to what the working people have to do to make ends meet. Jessica Simpson was on TV the other day and she is sooo stupid ... it is a crime that wonderful talents in classical music, medicine, engineering and the like are not recognized for what they do yet boners like JS, (and the like) can receive millions each year for nothing. The same could be said for Friends, Frazier, Justin Timberlake and the like. I would like to see the government claw back 90% of their salaries and divert the funds into social improvements. That way when one goes to see a movie they will feel twice as good as they know they will be helping society at the same time. Many of the stars seem to be convinced that they are the draw. I am convinced that you could substitute many \"big\" names with new talents and if the story and acting is good the movie will be a success. I often avoid a movie BECAUSE of who is in it - eg. Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts. I recently read that Raymond (of everyone loves Raymond) is paid 1.8million US dollars per episode. This is ridiculous..Let's rise up and bring these spoiled brats down back down to earth.",
