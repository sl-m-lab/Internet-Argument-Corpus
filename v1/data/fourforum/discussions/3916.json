   "So my youngest son is almost 20 months. and I think we are close to breaking in the new mini toilet...\n Since my oldest son is 14 it has been a very long time since I had to potty train someone. I am curious who is going through this now, maybe soon or remembers anything.. :)\n Any tips?\n He is talking very well and for the most part you can reason with him.",

   "my son will be 2 on the 16th (next week thursday! man!). he statred showing signs of interest in the potty, and he actually started using the toilet (the \"big\" one) for a few weeks. he has a little plastic stool that he moves positions himself, opens the toilet lid, pees and flushes. of course i have to fix his clothes back and wash his hands, but he is basically toilet capable (but still not toilet trained, which is due to my inconsistency)\n \n basically, whether you train him on the small potty and then later introduce him to the bathroom, or you do the bathroom first, i think the most important thing is consistency. continually ask him if he wants to go. be there when he has to go, and explain as much as you can everything thats going on. be excited about his progress, and verbalize even when he does something wrong or has an accident. eventually, he'll pick up all the steps and he'll become more independent\n \n of course, being a parent senior to me, i guess you know all this stuff already :)",

We just thought that since he now knows when he is \"stinky\" and will walk to the changing table grab a diaper and climb up, he is ready for the toilet....I laughed so hard when he did this the first time.\n My bday is also on the 16th :) Good day to be born!",

   "I've been through three and have been very successful...they all learned very early. One key someone mentioned earlier was always asking them...that's a must. Another thing is never use pull-ups, I think it confuses them and if they make a mistake they feel comfortable having done it. Let them make their mistakes in regular underwear so they know how uncomfortable it is when they do it, then they'll be less likely to keep making the mistake...works like a charm!!!",

   "I have found that the biggest no-no is trying to push before the kid is ready. It takes about twice as long.
