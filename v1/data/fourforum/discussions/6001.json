   " Supposing a particular party has a \"burden of proof\" is absurd.\n\n \n No, your claim is.\n \n One side has presumption and the other the burden of proof. \n \n Presumption essentially indicates which position, in the absence of any evidence, prevails. For example, the presumption of innocence in a court of law means that the defendant will prevail in the absence of evidence from either side.\n \n Burden of proof is the opposite of presumption. The party that bears the burden of proof must overcome the other party's presumption. That is, it is not enough to \"tie\" (if they do, then the party with presumption prevails), they have to clearly win. For example, in a court of law the prosecution has the burden of proof and must marshal enough evidence to overcome the presumption of innocence - they can't break even, they have to overcom reasonable doubt.\n \n So who had presumption and who had the burden of proof in the debate between The Skeptic and Clive14? The two most straightforwards ways of looking at the debate both show The Skeptic had the burden of proof.\n \n 1) By reading the wording of the \"resolved\" it is clear that The Skeptic had the burden of proof. It is not phrased neutrally, it is phrased as a assertion for ID. That assertion must be supported, and it is The Skeptic's job to do so.\n \n 2) The \"resolved\" dealt with a matter of science.

Equivocation? Hypocrite? Seeing the speck in the other guy's eye but not noticing the plank in his own? What's the term or phrase I'm looking for?\n \n Here we see The Skeptic try to claim that punctuated equilibrium is a \"totally separate issue from the resolution, which specifically says \"Neo-Darwinism\"\". Yet The Skeptic himself, in his very first post of the debate, went WAY BEYOND Clive14's \"error\" ... The Skeptic slyly made the leap all the way from \"Neo-Darwinism\" to ALL OF EVOLUTION!\n \n \nThe Skeptic: Let us start with a quote from Darwin, in the origin of the species:\n \n **********************************\n If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. \n **********************************\n \n So, if I can demonstrate that something could not have evolved by \"numerous, successive, slight modifications,\" evolution is in the dumpster according to Darwin himself.

Michael Behe defines the term within Darwins Black Box, his \n book on the subject.\n \n **********************************\n Behe: a single system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning \n **********************************\n \n We see that if I can demonstrate that an irreducibly complex system exists, I have won the debate and proven evolution incorrect.\n\n \n \n So The Skeptic performed a much larger leap that anything Clive14 did: The Skeptic went from neo-Darwinism to ALL OF EVOLUTION.\n \n Now, The Skeptic is wrong for doing this; I will present a few reasons why.\n \n 1) Symbiogenesis. Lynn Margulis argues strongly against neo-Darwinian evolution being the major driving force behind biological novelty, arguing instead that it occurs primarily by a form of symbiosis. \n \n \n'University of Massachusetts Amherst biologist Lynn Margulis said that \"neo-Darwinism is dead\", because \"random changes in DNA alone do not lead to speciation. Symbiogenesis - the appearance of new behaviors, tissues, organs, organ systems, physiologies or species as a result of symbiont interaction - is the major source of evolutionary novelty in eukaryotes; animals, plants, and fungi.\"' (Michael Shermer, Rumsfeld's Wisdom, Scientific American, September 2005, p38) \n \n\n \n So even if The Skeptic were to sucessfully eliminate neo-Darwinian evolution, there would still be symbiogenesis left as an evolutionary means of producing biological novelty: The Skeptic still would not have proven evolution to be incorrect, despite his claim - he'd still have more work to do.\n \n 2) Evo-Devo. Evolutionary developmental biology (Evo-Devo) is a relatively new field that, unlike Neo-Darwinian evolution, includes/emphasizes embryology and thereby better explains the creative side of evolution. Since The Skeptic's argument is against neo-Darwinian evolution only, it does not address the wide range of findings from the field of Evo-Devo, and therefore, The Skeptic could not possibly prove evolution to be false by eliminating only neo-Darwinian evolution.\n \n 3) Brute luck? Even Behe admits that multiple, simultaneous mutations producing an IC system cannot actually be ruled out, saying, \"Such an appeal to brute luck can never be refuted\" (page 40). We can find such an explanation wanting or unsatisfying, but being highly unlikely is not the same as proving that it could not happen. For The Skeptic to PROVE - his word - evolution false, he'd have to PROVE that brute luck couldn't somehow assemble an IC biochemical system (for example, cilium from the biomolecular parts (microtubules, dynein, etc.) already present in the cell), but he cannot do that.\n \n \n So The Skeptic's logic underlying his entire argument is fatally flawed. \n \n And in more than one way! ...

Besides the fatal flaw in The Skeptic's logic that I pointed out in my last post ....\n \n This may surprise a lot of people because IDists tend to ignore this point, but Behe says that an IC system CAN be the product of evolution! How? Via an INDIRECT route.\n \n \n\"Even if a system is irreducibly complex (and thus cannot have been produced directly), however, one can not definitely rule out the possibility of an indirect, circuitous route.\" (Michael Behe, Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution, Free Press, 1996, page 40) \n\n \n Behe's actual position is that an IC biochemical system literally cannot arise (evolve) IN A PARTICULAR MANNER, not that it can't arise (evolve) at all. \n \n That this is the case can be seen by expanding upon The Skeptic's quote of Behe:\n \n \n\"By irreducibly complex I mean a single system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning. An irreducibly complex system cannot be produced directly (that is, by continuously improving the initial function, which continues to work by the same mechanism) by slight, successive modifications of a precursor system, because any precursor to an irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is by definition nonfunctional.\" (emphasis added, Michael Behe, Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution, Free Press, 1996, p39) \n\n \n I agree with Behe that, by definition, an IC biochemical system cannot arise BY A DIRECT PATHWAY OF THE KIND BEHE DESCRIBES. But what about an INDIRECT route (such as one involving cooption)? Well, we have Behe's own words about that above, from page 40 of his book ... \"one can not definitely rule out the possibility of an indirect, circuitous route\".\n \n See the flaw in The Skeptic's underlying logic? Even if The Skeptic shows that an IC biochemical system actually does exist, he still has not proved evolution incorrect. All he would prove is that that particular system could not have arisen by a direct pathway that involved continuously improving the initial function, which continues to work by the same mechanism. He would not have shown that it could not have arisen (evolved) by an indirect route, such as by cooption.\n \n This matter is continued in my next post....",

But there's another reason why it fails.\n \n Note that The Skeptic (mirroring Behe) attempts to 'disprove evolution' by meeting Darwin's criterion. Now note something key about Darwin's criterion:\n \n \n \n\"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.\" (Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection) \n\n \n Unfortunately for The Skeptic, and Behe, one cannot refute Darwin's criterion using IC because Behe himself says that ORGANS are at too high of a biological level to meet his definition of IC!!!\n \n \n\"Biochemistry has demonstrated that any biological apparatus involving more than one cell (such as an organ or a tissue) is necessarily an intricate web of many different, identifiable systems of horrendous complexity.\" (Michael J. Behe, Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution, Free Press, 1996, p46)\n\n \n Remember, Behe's definition of IC requires it to be A SINGLE SYSTEM, not \"an intricate web of many different, identifiable systems\".\n \n Behe goes on to confirm that such systems don't meet his definition of IC ...\n \n \n\"Because each cell is such an interwoven meshwork of systems, we would be repeating the mistake of Francis Hitching by asking if multicellular structures could have evolved in step-by-step Darwinian fashion.\" (Michael J. Behe, Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution, Free Press, 1996, p46)\n\n \n Gee, isn't an ORGAN ad MULTICELLULAR structure? Yep, sure is.\n \n In fact, Behe's above statements show that even a SINGLE CELL, being \"an interwoven meshwork of systems\", is at too high of a biological level to be considered an IC system. To reinforce this, if cells are at too high of a level, and tissues are at a higher level of biological organization than cells, and organs are at an even higher level, then an organ cannot be an IC system.\n \n Further, even if we do reject Behe's own definition of IC - which we should not - the ID argument still fails! Behe says that we can't tell whether or not multicellular structures - and organs are - evolved in step-by-step Darwinian fashion, so one can't show that they didn't.\n \n Though none is needed, just as sort of reinforcement ...\n \n \n\"Both Hitching and Dawkins have misdirected their focus. The eye, or indeed almost any large biological structure, consists of a number of discrete systems. ...\n \n Hitching's argument is vulnerable because he mistakes an integrated system of systems for a single system, ... \" (Michael J. Behe, Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution, Free Press, 1996, p38-39)\n\n \n By Behe's own definition, neither The Skeptic nor Behe can meet Darwin's criterion - which specifically mentions a complex ORGAN - and thereby 'disprove evolution' by using IC, because there's no such thing as an IC ORGAN. Further, if we do examine an organ - which is necessarily a multicellular structure - one cannot say that it could not have been produced by step-by-step Darwinian fashion; so the whole exercise is futile from the start!\n \n \n \n The Skeptic's entire underlying logic was completely bogus ... invalid in a number of different ways.

Both have agreed to a 5/4 post structure. This means The Skeptic will post first, then Clive14 will respond, each in alternating fashion, with the final post by The Skeptic.\n\n \n 1) Again, it would be extremely unfair to spread the \"burden of proof\" evenly across both debaters because the number of posts is not split evenly between the two sides. The side that gets an additional post has a clear advantage in the debate, but since a debate is supposed to be equally fair to both participants, logic dictates that the shorted person must have some kind of an implied advantage in order to offset the one-post-deficit disadvantage. That advantage is presumption .... that is, the other party has the burden of proof. Without that, the debate is not fair.\n \n 2) Now let's look at the \"Resolved\" (which by the way, I don't consider to be an accurate term. Resolved indicates that the validity of the statement has already been determined ... the matter has already been resolved. But it hasn't: in fact, it is the point of contention that is in need of being resolved). It is CLEARLY not a neutral statement.

Quite different. Showing clearly that the assertion under consideration is not neutral, but obviously an ID one. Since the only item under consideration at this point is a (controversial) ID assertion - one we know is being challenged - then the person representing ID needs to support it. Hence, again, The Skeptic has the burden of proof.\n \n 3) The \"resolved\" goes against the status quo. That is, in the absence of any evidence by either side, the current status quo prevails. And since it is the non-ID side that is the status quo, it has the presumption - and therefore, the other side - the ID side - has the burden of proof.\n \n 4) Finally, although not universal, a general rule of thumb is that in a debate, the party arguing the affirmative has the burden of proof.

Had the wording been Resolved: Evolution doesn't exist I wouldn't have ruled the same way. \n As for the specifics:\n \n\n The Skeptic quotes Darwin as saying:\n \n \"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory [evolution] would absolutely break down.\"\n \n We were then informed that if IC can be shown, neo-Darwinism is false. This was the reason for the specific wording of the resolution then. But it does not follow, IMO. For example, could not Darwin simply have been mistaken in his assumption, yet neo-Darwinism remain a viable, vibrant theory? Is it wise to endow Darwin with infallibility before attempting to destroy him?\n\n In the debate, we were asked to judge based on the debater's ability to support or disprove the resolution. What you did was reinterpret the resolution to fit your belief. The Skeptic was very careful in chosing the battlegrounds and you judged based on a different battle than the one agreed upon.\n \n\n Clive14 began poorly, his first post had an autopilot feel to it, with no attributions, and was promptly called on it. He recovered nicely and became fully engaged in his second post. This is where I felt he grabbed the ball and never gave it back.\n \n I was puzzled by the use of the term \"neo-Darwinism\". I kept waiting to learn why The Skeptic chose that term in the wording of the resolution, but he never addressed it. Instead he used \"evolution\" throughout the debate. Clive14 defined it for us in his last post.\n\n Clive14 provided analogous systems to IC systems, but never provided the definitive link that one of these analogous systems could have evolved into the more complex IC system. \n \n\n An interesting sidebar developed over a thinking aloud comment by The Skeptic of his suspicion that Clive14 used his own web page writings to support a particular point. Clive14 has stated he is not the author, and it is well enough to leave it at that.\n\n Agreed now that I'm aware that Clive isn;'t the author.\n \n\n The almost singular use of Behe by The Skeptic was disappointing, as both judges have already observed, and particularly damning to his case was when Clive14 pointed out Behe's own words on the matter regarding \"neo-Darwinism\" as it relates to IC:\n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Clive14\n The final nail though in the coffin of the claim that IC somehow threatens evolution is of course the vast mass of evidence in support of evolution that is unrelated to IC. Even Behe acknowledged this:\n \n [I]'For the record, I have no reason to doubt that the universe is the billions of years old that physicists say it is. Further, I find the idea of common descent (that all organisms share a common ancestor) fairly convincing, and have no particular reason to doubt it.'[/]\n \n \"So the idea that life first appeared billions of years ago and has evolved, through common descent, into what we see today is seen as fitting alongside IC by the very man who proposed IC. My opponent however chooses to ignore this aspect of Behe's argument and claims that IC somehow \"proves neo-Darwinism incorrect\".\n \n \n \"The vast mass of evidence in support of evolution that is unrelated to IC.\" The resolution is doomed by this fact. It is a false bifurcation to declare that \"if this, then that\".\n \n This is indeed a final nail-a fatal flaw--and cannot be reconciled to the unambiguous wording of the resolution.\n\n The resolution wasn't \"Does evolution exist?\" You interpretted the resolution that way and that was a fatal flaw in your judgement, IMO. The debate was won on the topic by The Skeptic. It was only after personal redefinition of the resolution by the judges did Clive14 gain his victory.\n \n\n My vote goes to Clive14, and by a 2-1 margin, he is the winner of this debate.\n \n ------------------------------------------\n Thanks to both participants for their effort in making this an outstanding debate. It is a nice addition to the Debate Room in our forum. I hope their example will encourage others to try their hand at it.\n \n For those who would like to comment on this debate, please feel free to do so here.\n\n \n Some closing thoughts about debates in general.\n 1. The resolution is an extremely important part and should not be taken lightly, nor should it be reworded by the judges after the fact. If both parties agree to the wording, then the debate should rest on the merits of the debaters' efforts to argue the affirmative or negative of the resolution.\n 2. A debate should stand on its own merits. External knowledge possessed by the judges should be inconsequential in the evaluation of the debate. If I \"know\" that the Moon is composed of Swiss Cheese but the debaters are debating that it is composed of something else, my knowledge should not impact my ruling on the merits of the debate. A good judge maintains a \"blank slate\" status.\n 3. Personal attacks and snide comments designed to rattle an opponent work, but shouldn't be part of any formal debate.\n \n This was an enjoyable experience. I encourage more people to engage in this type of debate. Thanks to Billsco for arranging the debate and to The Skeptic and Clive14 for the debate and Waxy and Billsco for judging. emoticon_xgood",
