The thing is, the media reports every single incident making it seem more common than it really is.\n \n As far as uses for a gun: In the US lots of people live in rural areas where it could take police about an hour, or even longer, to respond. People in that situation cannot rely on police protection. In addition, our police force is NOT obligated to serve as a protection force for citizens. Instead, our police are supposed to solve crimes after they occur.\n \n People in the US grew up with firearms and shooting sports. Hunting, trap and skeet, and target shooting are important parts of American culture. In fact, our government thought it was so important for citizens to be able to use firearms that they created the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP). The CMP sells high-powered military surplus rifles at cost, to US citizens.\n \n Joszi and Bram, what experience with firearms do you have?

Also look at the crime rate percentage because we have a larger population. But the majority of our crime is done with illegaly owned firearms as well. So if you did take away our guns the criminals who already are getting them illegally will just get more illegally and us law-abiding citizens will be left defensless. It is shown in our history the less legal guns the more illegal gun violence. As shown in Washington D.C. ( that is our country's captial ) they banned all handguns, and in one year the crime in Washington D.C. sky-rocket 200%. But in Florida they adopted the right to carry a concealed firearm and the crime rate decreased 41%.

   "In my opinion, there are fundamental problems with cross-national/cultural comparisons of firearm homicide rates. I believe you really are talking about apples and oranges when we try to do this. You can't compare the Netherlands or England, for example, with the United States and draw any logical conclusions without considering the vast difference in social and economic issues which drive the violence rates. The same problem arises when those on my side of the debate try to compare America with Switzerland, which has an extraordinarily high percentage of private gun owners while enjoying an extraordinarily low violent crime rate. You can't compare these nation's crime rates with America's because the social and economic issues which drive violent crime in these countries are different. \n \n I do know this from experience, though. The presence of the weapon does not give rise to the motive to use it for criminal ends. There are no evil little voices calling from the gun cabinet to plague American homeowners. England and the Netherlands have not avoided these sinister voices advocating gun violence with a ban on guns. The people of Switzerland are not collectively so hard of hearing that they have proven immune to the subliminal demands of their guns to be loaded and unleashed on the innocent.\n \n I have seen people on my side of the debate argue that if a crime rate drops after a state passes a CCW statute then the deterrent effect of armed citizens must be responsible for the drop. Listen, I am as strong a supporter of the individual RKBA as there is, but I cannot find sufficient evidence to suggest that crime rates go down because we pass a CCW bill. It's the same problem gun control proponents have: we all want to believe what we want to believe, and we are prepared to claim that a statistical correlation equals cause and effect when it suits our purpose. \n \n What I do know, however, is that the overall violent crime rate in America is not tied to the number of privately available firearms. More guns does not equal more violence. \n \n Here is why I say this:\n \n First see the latest 10 year survey of firearm violence statistics conducted by your government:\n \n http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/guns.htm#findings\n \n This is a sample of what you would find:\n \n \"Firearm-related crime has plummeted since 1993.\"\n \"Nonfatal firearm crime rates have declined since 1994, reaching the lowest level ever recorded in 2002 and 2003.\" \n \"After 1994, the proportion of nonfatal violent incidents involving a firearm declined.\"\n \"Incidents involving a firearm represented 7% of the 4.9 million violent crimes of rape and sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated and simple assault.\"\n \n Now compare this trend of decline in firearm-related violence with the following ATF website, which lists new firearms manufactured for sale by domestic firearms manufacturers from 1998 to 2003 (the latest years available):\n \n http://www.atf.treas.gov/firearms/stats/index.htm\n \n \n From 98 to 2003, 19,185,247 new firearms were produced for consumer retail in the U.S. by domestic firearms manufacturers. Of these, 5,098,722 were handguns. I can't say how many were produced from 1993 to 1997, because the web page stats only went back to 1998. Yet, if you look at the year to year stats from 1998 to 2003, you will see a markedly similar number of firearms produced each year by categories of handgun, rifle, and shotgun, which strongly suggests the number of newly available firearms each year from 1993 to 1997 increased at near the same rate. [note: a very small percentage of these firearms were exported out of our market, but likewise this survey does not include the larger number of firearms imported to our market from abroad. Additionally, these statistics exclude NFA controlled firearms like the weapons which were produced for military/law enforcement and not civilian consumption)\n \n When you set these two surveys side by side, what you see is this:\n \n In the last ten year study, we had a marked decline in firearm violence during a period in which we added millions of new firearms to those available for criminal mischief--nearly 20 million new firearms alone from 1998 to 2003. I cannot say that millions more guns in the civilian marketplace is the cause of this crime rate drop. (in fact, I have another theory for the crime rate drop). What I can say, however, is that adding millions of new firearms to our civilian market did not cause the streets to run red.",

   "Let me tell you one of the reasons why I fight to protect my RKBA, Bram and Joszi. I believe that the Bill of Rights to my constitution (including the RKBA) is the greatest pronouncement of civil liberties which has ever been assembled to restrain a government from oppressing those it was created to serve. It is no coincidence that the Bill of Rights was drafted by revolutionaries who took up arms to secure their freedom. \n \n Many people in my country today view the revolutionary war as one fought against England as if it were a foreign power. Too many have forgotten that in reality my founding fathers fought their own government--a government that was bent on disarming them and using its standing army to oppress them. My nation was born from the courage of those who fought their own government and wrested from its grip the possession of the basic rights of man. \n \n When it came time to form a new government, these same men pledged to form one which would protect their natural and inalienable rights--the rights to life, liberty, property, and pursuit of happiness listed in their Declaration of Independence from tyranny. To preserve these natural rights, they chose to shackle their new government with the obligation to recognize certain civil liberties-liberties which by their nature preserve and protect these natural rights. The right to keep and bear arms was one of these civil liberties: \n \n \"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. A military force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power, and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination, to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppress.\" Noah Webster, \"An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution\" (1787) in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).\n \n See also the great Anti-Federalist Patrick Henry, who urged the rejection of a constitution which did not enshrine protections for civil liberties, including the RKBA: \n \n \"Is it necessary for your liberty, that you should abandon those great rights by the adoption of this system?. . . Will the abandonment of your most sacred rights tend to the security of your liberty?. . . .I am fearful I have lived long enough to become an old fashioned fellow: Perhaps an invincible attachment to the dearest rights of man, may, in these refined enlightened days, be deemed old fashioned: If so, I am contented to be so. . . . Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it, but downright force: Whenever you give up that force, you are inevitably ruined. . . .\n \n My great objection to this Government is, that it does not leave us the means of defending our rights; or, of waging war against tyrants. . . .\n \n The Honorable Gentleman who presides, told us, that to prevent abuses in our Government, we will assemble in Convention, recall our delegated powers, and punish our servants for abusing the trust reposed in them. Oh, Sir, we should have fine times indeed, if to punish tyrants, it were only sufficient to assemble the people. Your arms wherewith you could defend yourselves, are gone. . . . Did you ever read of any revolution in any nation, brought about by the punishment of those in power, inflicted by those who had no power at all? You read of a riot act in a country [England] which is called one of the freest in the world, where a few neighbors cannot assemble without the risk of being shot by hired soldiery, the engines of despotism. We may see such an act in America. A standing army we shall have also, to execute the execrable commands of tyranny: And how are you to punish them? Will you order them to be punished? Who shall obey these orders? Will your Mace-bearer be a match for a disciplined regiment? In what situation are we to be? . . . .What resistance could be made? The attempt would be madness.\" Patrick Henry, Speeches of June 5 and 7, 1788, before the Virginia Ratifying Convention, reprinted in The Anti-Federalist Papers and the Constitutional Convention Debates, pages 199-216, Mentor Books, 1986, edited by Ralph Ketchum.\n \n This was the spirit of the times, Bram and Joszi, when these revolutionaries considered how best to frame protections for their liberties. When my Bill of Rights was drafted, it accepted Henry's criticism and included an individual RKBA:\n \n \"Mr. Madison has introduced his long expected amendments. . . .It contains a bill of rights [including] . . . .the right to keep and bear arms.\" Fisher Ames, 1 Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 52-53 (1854) [Letter to Thomas Dwight, June 11, 1789].\n \n \"The rights of conscience, of bearing arms, of changing the government, are declared to be inherent in the people.\" Fisher Ames, 1 Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 53-54 (1854) [Letter to F. I. Minoe, June 12, 1789].\n \n \"Last Monday, a string of amendments were presented to the lower house; these altogether respected personal liberty. . .  .\" William Grayson, 3 Patrick Henry, p. 391 (1951) [letter from Grayson to Henry, June 12, 1789].\n \n Why and individual RKBA, you might ask? For the reason set forth by one of the founders, who explained the purpose of the 2nd. Amendment as follows: \n \n \"As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear private arms.\" Tench Coxe, Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution. Published under the pseudonym, \"A Pennsylvanian\" in the Philadelphia Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789 at 2 Col. 1. (Emphasis added)\n \n Here is my point, Bram and Joszi. These lofty ideals of securing individual liberty are often lost on today's generation. Many of my countrymen today gladly live under the shelter of these rights, yet they would not lift a finger to defend them if attacked by opportunists who argue that these fundamental rights must yield to the goal of some present day expediency. For many these rights have become bland clich\u00e9s which deserve nothing more than lip service as defense from encroachment.\n \n You will find that within my country there are great differences of opinion on this subject. If you follow the confirmation process of the newly-appointed Supreme Court justice candidate you may even see the issue of the RKBA addressed in that forum. Indeed, I think the discussion of the RKBA likely during this confirmation process, because there are those involved in the process who would attack the RKBA as anachronistic and even dangerous. Those who believe that it should be separated from its sister rights and abolished, that the government should no longer be forced to respect this basic right of man. In my opinion, it is because of men and women like this that my rights are protected by a constitution: \n \n \"The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.\" Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, New Haven, 1921.\n \n In my opinion, Bram and Joszi, those who attack my RKBA because they personally dislike the right unwittingly weaken the entire fabric of my constitutional liberties. By attacking one liberty they view with disgust, they encourage others to exercise the same zeal in attacking liberties that they happen to be biased against. This is the primary reason why I oppose such opportunistic demagoguery seeking to ban my RKBA. Even if I were not a gun owner, and this were the only reason I had to consider the RKBA, then I would still defend it for this principle alone.\n \n ---\n \n \"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\" Justice Brandeis, Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 485 (1928).",

Do you throw it away, or haul it around in the trunk because only a complete idiot runs around without a spare? \n \n A gun is the same way. You hope you never need it, and odds are that you won't. BUT, when you DO need it, you need it RIGHT NOW, you need it REALLY BAD, and nothing else will substitute quite as well. \n \n Is is paranoid to accept that there are bad people in this world, and that if you come up against one of them, nobody is going to be able to help you but you? No. That is simply reality. To refuse to accept that is delusional at best. \n \n Basically, if you are willing to take a long hard look at the world, accept the fact that there are some unsavory elements in it, and take responsibility for ensuring your own safety, and the safety of your loved ones, then you should probably have a gun. If, on the other hand, you prefer to pretend that the world is all flowers and sunshine, or are too cowardly or insecure to take responsibility for your family, then you probably don't need one.\n \n Besides, as JP points out, shooting can be fun. I have participated in multiple mistol events and machine gun shoots, and they are always a good time. I have a pretty good sized gun collection ranging from italian dueling pistols to M-60 machine guns. \n \n In many cases, your guns are also a good investment, especially when it comes to machine guns.

Even if we go with your wording, which forces us to use shootings as opposed to defensive use in general (which would be a more proper measure) you are still statistically safer having a gun than not.\n \n In reality, the number of accidental shootings is very low. It looks like a big number, because you are working from a pool of 300,000,000 people. In 2001, there were only 804 accidental shooting deaths nationwide. That is .00000268% of the population. \n \n Lott ahs a bit about accidental shootings at http://www.lewrockwell.com/lott/lott19.html He DID miss something, though. In addition to cars and bathtubs, toilets and 5 gallon buckets also kill more children than guns do, and certainly kill MANY more accidentally.",

   "I think you're right; it is more serious than just a hobby. It is ingrained in the American culture from its inception. America has an obsession with guns. Guns and violence appear in every form of art and entertainment; it is engrained in the culture as a symbol of power, freedom and even sensuality. Every boy grows up learning violence from TV and games, where violence is glorified. Problems are always solved with violence. Charlton Heston said that the reason Americans need there guns is because America was founded in violence. The old Wild West movies depict the beginning of a gun-ho America where everything is settled with the gun. Today we have an America that is equally as gun-ho but at an international scale with MOABS, cluster bombs, Tomahawk missiles, napalm bombs and nuclear weapons. \"I love napalm in the morning\" for example, is every American's favourite movie line.\n\n \n Do not attempt to associate the gun with violence. A gun is a life saving tool in the hands of a great citizen, and in the hands of a criminal, its deadly. Guns have no effect on crime, as statistics have shown. Violence does. Why do you view the gun different than any other tool, such as a screwdriver, or a hammer? Airplanes are much more dangerous, and have the possibility to do much more harm than guns, so why arent you associating airplanes with violence?\n \n A gun is an inaminate object. There is a difference between a gun and a bomb. A bomb wipes out everyone in a set area, and you cannot control who dies. With a gun, you know excatlcy who you are shooting, and you cannot kill more than 1 or 2 people with 1 bullet. I really dont understand why Anti-gun zealots dont go after banning cars, or airplanes, or other dangerous machines.\n \n You are one of the people the Brady Campaign has brainwashed. You associate guns with \"bad\" or \"violence\" when they are far from it. A gun is a tool, and everyone should learn how to use that tool safely. It is also our freedom.\n \n Remember the holocaust? Imagine what would've happened if all of the jews had guns. There probably wouldn't have been as many jews tortured and killed, and a lot of germans probably would've had their head blown off, which is good. I also dont see why Anti-gun zealots arent trying to clamp down on crime instead of guns.\n \n \n \n http://www.putfile.com/pic.php?img=3706480",

Muggings, burglaries, rapes, assault and battery are all examples of violent crimes that don't require a gun. Guns may be used in such crimes, but often that adds a completely new charge like \"assault with a deadly weapon.\" Please apply some common sense. What do the majority of gun owners use their guns for? Hunting, sport, and self-defense. People who use guns to commit crimes against other citizens are in the minority of the population. Gun laws are only going to harm law-abiding citizens. By definition, laws will not affect the behavior of criminals. If they are obeying the laws, they wouldn't be criminals in the first place, right? Think about it. If you were a criminal, would you rather target somebody who is unarmed or somebody who has a gun?",

Thanks God for that.\n\n You might feel safe, but it appears that women in Australia aren't. I guess all those macho gunless males need somebody to beat on. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n The best indicators available to date about the levels of violence against women in Australia are from the 1996 ABS publication Women's Safety Survey and the more recent ABS Personal Safety Survey 2005 that surveyed both men and women. The surveys asked women about their experiences of violence and found that:\n \n 5.8 per cent of women had experienced violence in the 12 month period preceding the survey in 2005 compared with 7.1 per cent in 1996\n 4.7 per cent of these women had experienced physical violence (this includes physical assault and threat of physical assault) in 2005 compared with 5.9 per cent in 1996, and 1.6 per cent had experienced sexual violence (this includes sexual assault and threat of sexual assault) compared to 1.5 per cent in 1996\n Of the women who experienced sexual violence during the 12 months prior to the 2005 survey 21 per cent had experienced sexual assault by a previous partner in the most recent incident, and 39 per cent by a family member or friend\n The 2005 survey also showed that of those women who were physically assaulted in the 12 months prior to the survey, 38 per cent were physically assaulted by their male current or previous partner. Of the women who had experienced violence by a current partner, 10 per cent had a violence order issued against their current partner and of those women who had violence orders issued, 20 per cent reported that violence still occurred.\n http://www.aph.gov.au/library/intguide/SP/Dom_violence.htm\n \n\n \n Now, we all know that we are much more violent in the US, so what are the statistics on domestic violence against women here?\n \n\n Women experienced intimate partner violence at lower rates in\n 1998 than in 1993. From 1993 to 1997 the rate of intimate\n partner violence fell from 9.8 to 7.5 per 1,000 women. In 1998\n the rate was virtually unchanged from that in 1997 (7.7 per\n 1,000 women).\n http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/ascii/ipv.txt\n \n\n 7.5 per 1000 = ).75%, almost 1/10th of Australia's rate.",

   " How the heck are guns addictive? Tell me when you can provide some legitimate study that says guns contain nicotine, and then i will believe you. Tobacco has nothing to do with guns ... What the heck to guns have to do with being \"seduced\" or \"allured\". Im sorry, but even though you wish you had some reason to disregard my arguments, you dont, and you're going to have to face the music sooner or later, without zingers like \"the allure of guns\". Im sorry, but Guns dont \"allure\" or \"seduce\" you... \n\n \n I can see you're upset with me. Yes, we disagree, but I didn't mean to upset you. I'm sorry if I did. And yes, I made a comparison with the tobacco industry. Unfortunately you misunderstood this as meaning that guns have nicotine. I could've also made a comparison with the alcohol industry. My points are very simple:\n \n 1. The allure for guns comes from the way guns and violence are glorified in the arts and entertainment industry (not by accident), just as drinking or smoking cigarettes were once glorified by the same industry. Our children are brought up with the poison of violence from the day they are born. In some European countries for example, sex in movies doesn't offend as much as violence in movies, in the US it's the opposite. This doesn't mean that Americans are more violent than Europeans, but it does show that arts and culture does have an influence on the population.\n \n 2. There wouldn't be as many guns in the streets (and there would be less wars) if the Arms industry didn't need to make even more of a profit, and there would be more gun control in America if it didn't bow to the interest of the Arms industry. Unfortunately, most of our lawmakers also have shares in the arms industry, which means that the way things are now; Americans are free game for the Arms industry, just as they were for the tobacco industry, until something was done.\n \n A last word on statistics: statistics would have us believe that more guns leads to less violence.

Now look at Vermont, they enacted Right-To-Carry laws awhile ago and have had very little crime ever since. Now look at Illinois, with very strict gun control.

Poisoning is carried out by government departments, especially in Tasmania. It results in prolonged suffering, the animal taking up to three days to die. Such a method of killing has been condemned by the RSPCA as \"cruel and unacceptable\". \n Moreover, before it dies, the animal becomes very thirsty, and often moves to a water source to drink. If it dies there, the poison may seep into the water and remain active for a long time (in cold water, more than 30 days), thus putting many other non-target species at risk.\n \n Further, the poison will remain active within the carcass until the carcass has completely broken down. Any animal feeding on the fresh carcass may also be poisoned. Many predators such as eagles are affected in this way.\n \n Ironically, there are still doubts about the effectiveness of 1080: some wallabies die, whist others don't. Wallabies are currently being bred at the Keith Turnbull Institute in Victoria to further investigate this.\n The use of more humane methods such as tree guards and perimeter fencing have been investigated, but are not seen as cost-effective, and so their use is restricted.\n http://www.animalsaustralia.org/default2.asp?IDL1=1273&IDL2=1298\n \n",

   "I agree that guns kill. I agree that a firearm ownership ban coupled with effective confiscation methods would dramatically reduce the number of murders committed by individuals with firearms. But I do not believe that a gun ban will make us any safer. Gun control has ever been the tool tyrants use to consolidate power. \n \n Here are some examples: \n \n \"The inhabitants of Boston being confined within that town by the general their governor, and having, in order to procure their dismission, entered into a treaty with him, it was stipulated that the said inhabitants having deposited their arms with their own magistrates, should have liberty to depart, taking with them their own effects. They accordingly delivered up their arms, but in open violation of honor, in defiance of the obligation of treaties, which even savage nations esteemed sacred, the governor ordered the arms deposited as aforesaid, that they might be preserved for their owners, to be seized by a body of soldiers; detained the greatest part of the inhabitants in the town, and compelled the few who were permitted to retire, to leave their most valuable effects behind.\n The general, further emulating his ministerial masters, by a proclamation bearing date on the 12th. of June, after venting the grossest falsehoods and calumnies against the good people of these colonies, proceeds to '[D]eclare them all, either by name or description, to be rebels and traitors, to supersede the course of the common law, and instead thereof to publish and order the use and exercise of the law martial.'\"\n The DECLARATION OF THE CAUSES AND NECESSITY OF TAKING UP ARMS (July 6, 1775).\n \n ---\n \n \"That no freedman, free negro or mulatto. . .not licensed to do so by the board of police of his or her county, shall keep or carry fire-arms of any kind, or any ammunition, dirk or bowie knife. . . .\" Laws of Mississippi, 1865, p. 165 (November 29, 1865).\n \n \"In Mississippi rebel State forces, men who were in the rebel armies, are traversing the State, visiting the freedmen, disarming them, perpetrating murders and outrages on them. . . .\"-- Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, at p. 40 (December 13, 1865) [Speech of Senator Henry Wilson (Republican-Massachusetts)]\n \n \"Editor Loyal Georgian: Have colored persons a right to own and carry firearms?--A Colored Citizen\n Almost every day we are asked questions similar to the above. We answer certainly you have the same right to own and carry arms that other citizens have. You are not only free but citizens of the United States and as such entitled to the same privileges granted to other citizens by the Constitution. . . .\n Article II, of the amendments to the Constitution of the United States, gives the people the right to bear arms, and states that this right shall not be infringed. Any person, white or black, may be disarmed if convicted of making an improper or dangerous use of weapons, but no military or civil officer has the right or authority to disarm any class of people, thereby placing them at the mercy of others. All men, without distinction of color, have the right to keep and bear arms to defend their homes, families or themselves.\" From issues of the Loyal Georgian, January 20, 27 and February 3, 1866.\n \n ---\n \n \"Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the Act of depriving a whole nation of arms, as the blackest.\" 2 M. Gandhi, An Autobiography of the Story of My Experiments with the Truth, (M. Desai, trans. 1927).\n \n ---\n \n \"The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the supply of arms to the underdogs is a sine qua non for the overthrow of any sovereignty. So let's not have any native militia or native police. German troops alone will bear the sole responsibility for the maintenance of law and order throughout the occupied Russian territories, and a system of military strong-points must be evolved to cover the entire occupied country.\" Adolf Hitler, dinner talk on April 11, 1942, quoted in Hitler's Table Talk 1941-44: His Private Conversations, Second Edition (1973), Pg. 425-426.\n \n ---\n \n \"With a basis in \u00a7 31 of the Weapons Law of 18 March 1928 (Reichsgesetzblatt I, p. 265), Article III of the Law on the Reunification of Austria with Germany of 13 March 1938 (Reichsgesetzblatt I, p. 237), and \u00a7 9 of the Fuhrer and Chancellor's decree on the administration of the Sudeten-German districts of 1 October 1928 (Reichsgesetzblatt 1, p. 1331 ) are the following ordered:\n \u00a7 1\n Jews (\u00a7 5 of the First Regulations of the German Citizenship Law of 14 November 1935, Reichsgesetzblatt 1, p. 1332) are prohibited from acquiring, possessing, and carrying firearms and ammunition, as well as truncheons or stabbing weapons. Those now possessing weapons and ammunition are at once to turn them over to the local police authority.\n \u00a7 2\n Firearms and ammunition found in a Jew's possession will be forfeited to the government without compensation.\n \u00a7 3\n The Minister of the Interior may make exceptions to the Prohibition in \u00a7 1 for Jews who are foreign nationals. He can entrust other authorities with this power.\n \u00a7 4\n Whoever willfully or negligently violates the provisions of \u00a7 1 will be punished with imprisonment and a fine. In especially severe cases of deliberate violations, the punishment is imprisonment in a penitentiary for up to five years.\n \u00a7 5\n For the implementation if this regulation, the Minister of the Interior waives the necessary legal and administrative provisions.\n \u00a7 6\n This regulation is valid in the state of Austria and in the Sudeten-German districts. \n Berlin, 11 November 1938\n Minister of the Interior \n Frick\" http://www.jpfo.org/NaziLawEnglish.htm \n \n ---\n \n We have seen many oppressive governments in the last century. Can anyone here name a Latin American dictator, or Fascist or Communist head of state, who did not favor the use of gun control as a means to maintain power? Could it happen in my country? Ask the descendants of those newly freed slaves in the south. Ask your Japanese American friends whether their parents were allowed to possess firearms during their incarceration in American internment camps. Ask your Native American friends if they felt safer because of laws which denied them the RKBA, laws which were not finally abolished until the Carter Administration saw reason to do so. \n \n We have had our share of wars in the last century, but far more unarmed innocent civilians were killed in the 20th century by their own governments than by foreign troops in wartime. Gun control's chief rallying cry is that it will make you safer. Would the unarmed millions who lie buried in the Russian steppes agree? Would the ghosts of Auschwitz agree? Would the bleached bones lying in the killing fields of Cambodia agree? Would the families who cowered in fear of government death squads in Latin America agree? Would the unarmed victims of Serbian ethic cleansing agree? \n \n You may not like the RKBA and wish it did not exist. But ask yourself this: When it is a right you do treasure, and when your own government uses the same safety argument to encroach on that right, like your right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure-\"but we need this surveillance law to keep you safe from terrorists\"-will you be so quick to agree the benefits outweighs the risks to your freedom?\n \n Yes, gun violence is a problem in my country. But more guns do not equal more killings with them. Neither will a ban on guns equal a ban on the motives that cause us to kill each other. Gun violence is a complex human behavioral problem. It is not, as gun control supporters incorrectly view it, a simple economic supply problem to be placed in the constitutional scales in the blithe hope that it outweighs a fundamental liberty interest which they find repulsive. The reason why we protect fundamental rights by putting them into constitutions, the reason why we do not let partisans who detest these rights strip them from our constitutions for the purpose of destroying them in the scales of public opinion, is first and foremost because we cannot trust them to keep their thumbs off the scales, and secondly because we fear the encouragement that their \"it's a cut and paste constitution\" arguments give to others who secretly see other rights hindering their own desires. \n \n One of the enduring legacies of our constitutional freedom is the premise that no man has the moral authority to deny another the free exercise of a fundamental right unless and until that person forfeits it by misusing it. Blanket gun control, whether sought by Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, or by ordinary well-meaning Americans who want to do something to combat gun violence, runs counter to this principle of ordered liberty. \n \n ---\n \n \"The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.\" Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, Lecture II, 1921.\n \n \"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\" Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 485 (1928) (dissenting opinion).\n \n \"For those who beat their swords into plowshares will plow for those who didn't.\" -Bryan",

   "Guns kill. Simple as that. Therefore it should be banned.\n\n but they also save lives.\n \n Abduction interrupted\n Oakland Hills home invasion ends in shootout; women safe; police seek suspect\n A masked man abducted an Oakland Hills woman and her maid at gunpoint Friday before driving the pair to a Vallejo marsh, where authorities speculate he was about to kill them when a property caretaker interrupted the crime. \n The suspect had just forced one of the women to lie down in a ditch when the caretaker, armed with a shotgun for protection against thieves, arrived around 2 p.m., authorities said. The suspect and caretaker exchanged shots before the suspect sped away in the Oakland woman's Lexus sport-utility vehicle. \n \n No one was hit, and the women were not injured, though they had been bound and gagged. Tape could still be seen around one woman's neck as investigators questioned her at the Highway 37 scene. \n \n The suspect had unsuccessfully robbed the women, and authorities suspect he was trying to find an isolated spot to kill them. \n \n \"I don't know why else he would take her over there and make her lie in the ditch,\" Sheriff's Sgt. Jeff Brackett said. \n \n The shaken-up caretaker, Doug Paul of Vallejo, said: \"I think he was doing something bad. It's pretty f---ed up to have a woman gagged and bound.\" \n \n Authorities are on the lookout for the dark gray 2006 Lexus RX 400H Hybrid with California license plate number VMSUSS. The suspect is described as a large white man, at least 6 feet tall and 200 pounds. He was wearing a tank top, black gloves and possibly blue jeans. \n Authorities ask anyone who spots the vehicle to call 9-1-1 or the Solano County Sheriff's Dispatch at 421-7090. Because the suspect is considered armed and dangerous, authorities warn anyone who sees the vehicle not to approach it or the suspect. \n \n After interviewing the women and caretaker, Brackett said this is what investigators believe happened: \n \n The suspect allegedly invaded the upscale Oakland home in the first block of Sheridan Road and demanded cash from the 44-year-old homeowner and her 29-year-old maid. The women told authorities they do not know the man. \n \n Armed with a gun and knife, the suspect handcuffed them at the wrists and ankles, and taped their mouths with clear packing-style tape. He then forced the women into the Lexus and drove around for several hours, saying little to them. \n \n He did not say he intended to kill them, but at one point said he might seek a ransom for the older woman. That leads detectives to wonder if he knew the woman or her husband. \n \n The suspect pulled into a parking lot off westbound Highway 37 north of Wilson Avenue in unincorporated Vallejo. Leaving the maid in the vehicle, he led the homeowner into the adjacent marsh and forced her to lie down in a ditch behind a berm. \n \n Just then, the caretaker and a friend pulled into the lot to conduct the weekly check on the property. The maid got out of the Lexus and screamed for help. \n \n As the caretaker and friend were talking to the maid, the suspect emerged from behind 12-foot high weeds and ran toward the Lexus. The caretaker fired a warning shot to stop the suspect from fleeing, and the suspect fired three shots before taking off. \n \n The caretaker told the Times-Herald he dodged the suspect's bullets buy ducking in front of his car. \n \n \"It was amazing I wasn't shot,\" the caretaker said. \"At that time I was counting my blessings.\" \n \n As Paul was calling 9-1-1 from his cell phone, his friend, identified only as Roger, followed the suspect into Vallejo. The suspect fired at least one shot before Roger lost site of the vehicle. \n \n The 49-year-old Paul, who said he watches the property for The Oasis Corporation, wiped tears away as he recalled the bizarre incident. Paul said he arms himself because his mobile home at the site is frequently burglarized. \n \n \"This has never been a safe piece of property,\" Paul said. \n \n Although Paul said he feels lucky to have arrived in time to save the women from the suspect, he said, \"Being at the right place at the right time would have been when this a--hole was born.\" \n http://www.timesheraldonline.com/ci_4567700\n \n unless yuo think some one who would kidnap 2 people, and rob them, would follow other laws.",

No, we are not safer. The stats support it, both here and in England. Many states in the USA that have taken a shall-issue policy to CCW permits have experienced reduced levels of violent crime, indicating that guns may in fact make us more safe.

Because guns are used to shoot things, they are bad.\n \n I hope you'll not think me rude if I ask for a little more depth from you?\n \n For example, perhaps you could address the following question:\n \n How is the intended purpose of an item related to it's impact on a safer society?\n \n For example: Obesity kills more people than guns do, so it would make us safer to ban McDonalds than it would to ban handguns, regardless of the fact that a hamburger is meant to be eaten, while a gun is meant to shoot things.\n \n Also: More people are killed in car accidents than are killed by guns. If we banned cars, we would save more lives than we would by banning guns, regardless of the fact that a car is used for transport and a gun is used to shoot things.\n \n Now, following on from that comes a tricky question. I can only assume that your desire for a safer society is genuine. The passion that can be generated by the gun control debate is a direct result of peoples natural desire to live in a safer world, so when you say you want guns banned, I genuinely believe you want everyone to be safer.\n \n However, when confronted with facts (cars, drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, even swimming pools kill more people than guns, and that removing guns hasn't resulted in lower rates of violent crime) you refuse to engage in a discussion and instead continue to insist we should ban guns.\n \n My question to you is; why, even though it has been clearly demonstrated that removing guns doesn't make us safer, do you continue to insist we ban them?\n \n Why, when it has been clearly demonstrated that there are much more dangerous things in society, do you continue to insist that guns are dangerous enough to ban?",

   "Well, I havent read through all the previous post replies but i can simply say that we own several shotguns for hunting purposes, hunting animals, not people. they are safely locked away and the slugs are never kept in the same area. after each use they are double checked by both me and my husband to make sure there are no slugs left in the chamber and the safety is on. Our daughter is just a baby but we will be sure that when she gets old enough to understand, that we teach her that guns are not toys and she is not to touch them! eventually she WILL be taught to use them to hunt and will ONLY be able to use them under our supervision. \n In my opinion kids that get ahold of guns and accidentally shoot someone, are not taught that they are not toys and in some cases its poor parenting by leaving guns laying around loaded. \n My husband wants to teach our daugther to hunt and how to use a .22cal real young, like his buddy did with his son, his son knows that he is not to go near the locked cabinet unless his dad is there with him and he knows proper etiquette.

   "The RTBA was created to check the government, and is a part of our delacate system of checks and balances. Trying to condone gun control would be like eliminating one of the three branches.

Saying that the RKBA is only an effective check if .... (fill in excuse here) is a pointless argument that could be used for any topic. For example, making rape illegal is only effective if we are able to catch rapists and punish them. Therefore, if any rapists are able to escape, does that mean we should just go ahead and legalize rape? Of course not.\n \n As for your personal protection argument, that is just flat wrong based on simple logic. Of course statistics can be manipulated to prove a point; it is done all the time with everything. However, all you have to do is ask yourself a simple question. If you are a criminal, would you rather your victim be armed or not? The answer is clear. So if criminals would be in favor of banning guns, does that mean it would be in the best interest of society? Probably not.",

Therefore, if any rapists are able to escape, does that mean we should just go ahead and legalize rape? Of course not.\n\n With respect, I'm not quite that stupid :)\n \n Imagine for a moment that ammunition was illegal, and the ban enforcible. In that case you could bear all the arms you liked and it would avail you not at all, because something crucial to making your weapons potent would be denied to you.\n \n Ammunition isn't illegal, of course, but for your loaded gun to make you anything other - in the eyes of the world - than a crazed loner brought down after a lengthy siege by the gallant officers of the FBI, you need to be able to organise, speak out against the government, have your words heard by a thoughtful - rather than a nervous and blindly patriotic - public, rally the people and bring your one advantage, weight of numbers, to bear. The government can, and is, taking the right and ability to do those things from you with every hundred-page 'homeland security' bill it passes in the middle of the night and with every chest-thumping us-and-them god-bless-America speech it makes, while you sleep secure in the knowledge that your precious gun is close at hand.\n \n If the government ever comes for you bearing arms, rest assured they will ensure you are outnumbered and publicly reviled first. You will die alone and with your grievances unheard.\n \n \n However, all you have to do is ask yourself a simple question. If you are a criminal, would you rather your victim be armed or not? The answer is clear.\n\n That's not the only simple question one can ask, however. Take this one: If you were a criminal, would knowing that your victim is likely to be armed make you more, or less edgy and likely to shoot first, or in response to an unexpected move?\n \n Perhaps I'm wrong, but it seems to me that any argument you make for a more heavily-armed population being a safer one, you could also apply to - say - the nuclear brinkmanship of the cold war. What kind of country would you want as an enemy: a nuclear power or a non-nuclear power? When they are going to be thinking the same way, is the answer as clear as you'd like it to be?\n \n As I said, though: it's difficult to make a determination, and the reality of the current situation drastically limits our options. Before you get all hot under the collar about me wanting to ban guns, you might reflect for a moment on the fact I never said we should.\n \nThe RKBA is SUPPOSED to ensure that we as citizens have the tools at our disposal to mobilize strength of numbers if needed and not be slaughtered for our trouble becuase we were forced to stand unarmed against a heavily armed government.\n\n It's a heartwarming image, but the reality is that RTBA can and has been rendered irrelevant. As you say: all governments become, even with the best of intentions, tyrannical. What does such a body do when faced with the immovable object of the RTBA? It circumvents it - leverages it, even, by telling a frightened public that they can keep the RTBA, but that they must sacrifice their RTFS and RTA in the name of homeland security.\n \n Think for a moment, and try to imagine a situation where you could actually exercise your RTBA to meaningful political effect. Now consider that your hypothetical enemies, who are not stupid, are fully aware of what that situation would be and are perfectly capable of avoiding it ever coming to pass whilst still getting everything they want.",

   "Well let me say that I agree we need to be on our guard to protect more than just the RKBA. I have never been a supporter of the current administration's crime/terrorism fighting strategy where it encroaches on civil liberties. \n \n Listen, it is already frighteningly easy for law enforcement to lawfully break into your home. I know. I have on many occasions drafted the search warrants they use for this purpose. I've gone with officers and watched them break open doors. I've gone into houses with them, and watched them round up people and force them to lie face down at gunpoint in their own living rooms. I've watched officers rifle through clothes drawers, pull down and go through boxes of family photographs from the top shelves of closets, share a laugh when they find embarrassing sex toys, shout in triumph when they find a big wad of cash or drugs, take computers and other digital media away for later analysis, go through file cabinets in search of bank records, etc. I've later listened to tape recordings of phone calls made by the targets of search warrants, and heard how they complain to their wives/girlfriends/parents/children about how the house was violated and trashed during the search.\n \n The first and primary defense against this kind of power being abused is the trust you have to place in the officers themselves-the trust that they will know and obey the law and not lie to obtain probable cause on a search warrant. The second defense is your right to go to court after your privacy has been violated and demand that the government prove it did not violate your civil liberties by the search. \n \n Our civil liberties need people who are willing to stand up and protect them--everyday. I agree that we cannot be so focused on the RKBA that we forget the other rights in the Bill of Rights. Indeed, in my opinion the RKBA was listed in the BoR as a measure for protecting these other liberties. \n \n At the same time, I have little patience with dilettante civil libertarians who chant trendy slogans about protecting our rights only to blanch and fall silent when the RKBA is threatened. In my opinion, the Constitution is not a cut and paste document. We cannot safely treat the RKBA like it is the ugly red-headed step-child of the family of civil liberties. We cannot safely urge the government to destroy or even silently watch the government consume this liberty interest. If we do so, then we encourage others to attempt to eliminate portions of the Constitution which they find undesirable. It is too easy for a successful government sponsored slogan of \"it's too dangerous to allow people to have guns in such a violent culture\" to be turned into \"well it's also too dangerous to have a 4th. Amendment in the face of such violent Islamic terrorism.\" How many of our civil liberties are we willing to sacrifice at the altar of expediency in this fashion? \n \n For me, the answer is not one. Not now, not ever.\n \n ---\n \n \"The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.\" Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, Lecture II, 1921.\n \n \"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\" Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 485 (1928) (dissenting opinion).\n \n \"For those who beat their swords into plowshares will plow for those who didn't.\" -Bryan",

We cannot safely treat the RKBA like it is the ugly red-headed step-child of the family of civil liberties. We cannot safely urge the government to destroy or even silently watch the government consume this liberty interest.\n\n \n You speak eloquently and persuasively. The point I'm trying to make, however, is that one should recognise that the golden age of the RKBA (apologies for previous misspelling) as a front-line defence against the erosion of civil liberties is - for now at least - over. The pen may be mightier than the sword, but the routine sifting of internet traffic, the cell-phone trace, and the television set make the gun look faintly ridiculous. The power to drive hot pieces of metal into another person's flesh is, on an individual level, devastating, but feeble compared to the power leveraged by convincing a nation they are all - from the cities to the sticks - in imminent danger of death-by-terrorist.\n \nIndeed, in my opinion the RKBA was listed in the BoR as a measure for protecting these other liberties.\n\n I do not doubt you are correct, but times have changed, and now it is only strong defence of those other liberties that makes the RKBA mean anything at all. It is frightening to me to see a nation that coined and still clings to the phrase 'from my cold dead hands' voluntarily surrender far more potent and valuable liberties, either reluctantly out of fear or - in some cases - eagerly, to facilitate the moulding of America into something that better fits their personal beliefs. I feel it in some ways mirrors the way America itself has behaved on the world stage in recent times; from being an enlightened and powerful nation it seems now to be merely powerful. I apologise if readers find that offensive; I can only humbly submit that the face America presents to those within is not that seen from the outside.",

We are not nazi's that use \"we were under orders\" as an excuse to break the law. Sure there are some that will do as you say but American soldiers are trained to think for themselves and not blindly obey.\n\n \n Well gee..could we give this same training to NOPD?

When you ask a guy why he has a sports car, you don't get \"To outrun criminals.\"\n\n \n \"Why are auto-loading pistols so prolific?\"\n 1. Because they recoil less and carry more rounds than a revolver. You also have a limited choice of revolvers for calibers such as .45 ACP and 9 mm.\n \n \"When in need why use a pistol design that is more susceptible to jamming/FTF?\"\n 2. This has not really been the case for many, many years now. The modern semi-automatic handgun is remarkably reliable. In fact I have never had a jam/FTF in my G30 with over 3,000 rds. fired and there are many people out there with similar experiences.\n \"Is it the capacity?\"\n \n 3. Partly yes. If I happen to miss a bad guy who is trying to hurt me should I be punished because I could not hit him with my first 5 or 6 rds.? There is a video floating around of a cop who shot a BG 5 or 6 times with his G21(.45 ACP) and the man was still able to advance on him. Most people shot by a handgun do NOT die. Handgun calibers are notoriously poor at killing people. A determined threat makes this even more of an issue.\n \n \"I can almost guarantee you that if you unload an entire magazine on a criminal you will get charged.\"\n 4. You're kidding right? This is simply not true and I would like to know how you can \"almost guaruntee\" this. There was a shooting here in Ft. Myers Beach a couple of years ago where a guy did just that. A father woke up in his hotel room with a guy on top of him. Another guy pulled his daughter into the bathroom. The father and BG#1 struggled. Father grabbed gun from under pillow and killed BG#1 then proceeded to unload into BG#2. Both BG's died and no charges were filed. Of course this was Florida and here if someone breaks into your house in is considered a threat to your life and or a threat of bodily harm. You can shoot them and have immunity to civil and criminal charges.\n \n \"So why aren't revolvers anywhere as popular as auto-loaders? They pretty much never jam and in case of FTF you just pull the trigger again.\n 5. You are right about the jamming/FTF issue; for the rest see #1-#4.\n \n \"Why do people even buy 9mm? Because it's fun to unload 17 light rounds into the backstop at the range instead of 6 hand smashing .44mags\"\n 6. It is also easier to maintain rapid fire control for some people with the 9mm and yes as I said you mayneed more than just a few rds. to defend yourself. It is also, as you say, fun not to mention cheaper than .44mag.\n \n \"Why do you keep an AR-15? \"For home defense.\" Seriously folks...for home defense?\"\n 7. I keep an AR-15 for fun/home defense. The 5.56 is remarkably well suited for defense within the home. It will penetrate drywall less than the more common pistol calibers. The 5.56/.223 has a tendency to fragment; the same thing that makes it good for hurting people if needed. Why do you think most police dept. in America use the AR-15/M-16 or M-4 for building entry? It was designed for fighting for God's sake! How can you even ask this question? I guess because it is also good for targets out to 800m in some cases that you assume that long distance-mediam range shooting is it's only purpose.Before you say that the military uses it just for this, consider that most combat engagement ranges are at 300m and less. Even more are at the 100m and less mark. I suppose that you might just not know these things and there is nothing wrong with that. \n \n \"How many of you AR-15 folks stock nothing but FMJs?\"\n 8. I do. See my comments on fragmentation at #7.\n \n \"What happened to the shotgun? You can get auto-loading 12 gauges with detachable 20 round mags for half the price of an AR.\"\n 9. I have a shotgun too. They are great for home defense. You are right, they are cheaper than an AR. They do penatrate walls more than a 5.56mm/.223 which makes them more dangerous to innocent family members and bystanders/neighbors. Then there is the fact that I may want to go to the range and shoot 100m to 400m distances. Can't do that with a shotgun with the same accuracy.\n \n \n I hope response has been informative. If you have anymore question just ask. You may learn something.",

The Vietnamese had more than just rifles in the Vietnam \"security measure\", they were provided with large numbers of SAMs from Russia/China, they had light tanks, RPGs, mines, mortar and artillery pieces. Even the Iraqis have RPGs, explosives, grenades and shoulder mounted SAMs (stinger missiles). Even with that, Iraqi rebels aren't close to \"winning\" the war or even taking over any significant territory.\n\n \n First of all, who says that another country won't aid the american rebels? Second, if Iraqi's aren't close to winning, then what the hell is going on? We're suffering heavy casualties, when we have only scraped the tip of the iceberg on militia fighters.

The point was that we pulled out.\n \n \n \n \n \nThe interesting thing about Iraq is that rebellion has been a much more frequent occurence since the US invasion.

So when a successful rebellion is most needed (when a true tryrant is in power) people are least likely to attempt it.\n\n \n Were Hussain's subjects even allowed to bear arms? Hussain is way different than anything that can happen in the US.

There are those that disagree. \n \n 6. \"So where in CCW do they teach you to unload an entire mag?\"\n \n No where was I taught to unload an entire mag. I believe in shooting until the threat is stopped. If that takes one round then I will stop shooting. If it takes 7-10 rds. then that is what will happen.\n \n 7. \"In my state I've seen people convicted because they shot after the guy went down.\"\n \n They were wrong for doing that. If the BG was down then the threat is stopped. I never proposed one should shoot a BG after he was down or running away. \n \n 8. \"If a guy is still coming after you after 6 rounds of .45 ACP it means you should probably move up to 6 rounds of .44 mag.\"\n \n Not true! What if you do not shoot well with .44 mag.? Should one risk being sloppy with one's accuracy because some guy on the Internet says you should be able to stop a threat with 6 rds. or less?\n \n 9. \"There are plenty of caliber choices for revolvers that cover the whole spectrum from .32 to .500 s&w.\"\n \n For the most part I agree. They do however recoil more than a semi-auto and there is still that issue with limited choices in revolvers for 9mm, .45 ACP, and .40 cal. What about the reload issue? It is much easier and faster to reload with a mag change than moon clips for a revolver. Oh yea, I forgot. A person should not need more than 6 rds.\n \n 10. \"For personal defense ammo price shouldn't be a large factor, because you're not practicing to be good enough for a tattered hole at 40 yards.\"\n \n Wrong again. Many people shoot thousands of rds. per year. There is a significant difference between $8.00 per box of 50 9mm and $12.00 per box of 20 .44 mag. When you start buying a lot of rds. you can see what I mean. Practice makes perfect, especially under a stressful circumstance. Are you suggesting that one should only practice once or twice a year?\n \n 11. \"For HD there are better options than a pistol.\"\n \n True in my opinion, such as a shotgun or an AR. Some may feel more comfortable with a pistol. Are you making choices for them or just suggestions?\n \n 12. \"We're talking about HD, not urban assault. Planning for SHTF and zombie attacks is a whole different scenario. Then say you have an ar for \"When civilization breaks down\" when people ask you why you have an ar.\"\n \n I say I have an AR for fun, and HD after my pistol and shotgun. I have never seen a zombie, have you? I do know guys who use AR's for hunting varmints and coyote. Some even use them for boar.\n \n 13. \"As for pistol jamming, I've shot Ruger mkII & mkIII, browning buckmarks and glock 19. I've had 1 FTF on the glock and numerous jams on the rugers & buckmarks. This is probably b/c of extensive use and infrequent cleaning (they weren't my guns).

The chances are few it will happen, but the chances are few that you'll get murdered.\"\n \n I am not treating it like it is nothing. Jamming can happen but an FTFire can happen in a revolver too. True all you have to do is pull the trigger again but with a semi-auto all you have to do is tap the mag and rack the slide. Problem solved. I keep my guns clean though and as I have said I have yet to have a jam in my Glock (3000+ rds. fired). You are right the few chances to be murdered. Your chances of your house burning down are slim as well but I bet you have very modern fire extinguishers and smoke detectors don't you?\n \n 15. \"The whole point is I don't see many people admit in a serious argument that guns are fun to use. The response to why do you need guns is always : \"For defense\".\"\n \n Haven't I posted that guns are fun? It is fun to hunt with them. It is fun to plink with them. it is fun to compete with them. Everytime someone does one of these sports it is because it is fun. They are also a good idea for home defense. I guess the point is that people don't have to \"admit\" that they are fun. It is kind of obvious when they are doing things with them other than defending themselves.\n \n I am starting to get the impression that you want to restrict the types of guns that people own ala California stlye gun control.

If anything the shot pattern would have reached a torso sized spread at 20 yards making it more likely to hit than an ar.\n \n \n\n Shotguns with birdshot are not reliably effective for HD in my opinion. There are those that disagree. \n \n\n Then use a heavier load. A shotgun has so many more power varieties compared to a 5.56.\n \n \n\n No where was I taught to unload an entire mag. I believe in shooting until the threat is stopped. If that takes one round then I will stop shooting. If it takes 7-10 rds. then that is what will happen.\n \n\n \n Where is enough? You can go all the way up to 100 round drums for your pistol, which is hard to conceal but not impossible. 6 rounds should be enough and with reliability concerns on the side of autoloaders taking the hit and only getting 6 rounds is a safer solution.\n \n \n\n They were wrong for doing that. If the BG was down then the threat is stopped. I never proposed one should shoot a BG after he was down or running away. \n \n\n As above, where are the bad guys who can take 6 .44mags and keep going? If they really are around, we should carry rifles instead.\n \n \n\n Not true! What if you do not shoot well with .44 mag.? Should one risk being sloppy with one's accuracy because some guy on the Internet says you should be able to stop a threat with 6 rds. or less?\n \n\n \n Then learn to shoot well with the .44 mag. Do you recommend people to use .22lrs for CCW or tell them to take the time and learn to use something heavier?\n \n \n\n For the most part I agree. They do however recoil more than a semi-auto and there is still that issue with limited choices in revolvers for 9mm, .45 ACP, and .40 cal. What about the reload issue? It is much easier and faster to reload with a mag change than moon clips for a revolver. Oh yea, I forgot. A person should not need more than 6 rds.\n \n\n As above, for CCW concerns it's not going to be a long range shot. Until they learn to handle the difference they can get a .357/.38 and practice using .38s and go up to .357. There are existing 9mm, .45acp and .40 cal revolvers that are reliable as well, but why do they have to use these rounds?\n \n \n \n\n Wrong again. Many people shoot thousands of rds. per year. There is a significant difference between $8.00 per box of 50 9mm and $12.00 per box of 20 .44 mag. When you start buying a lot of rds. you can see what I mean. Practice makes perfect, especially under a stressful circumstance. Are you suggesting that one should only practice once or twice a year?\n \n\n \n There's a point where enough is enough. I learned how to hit a paper plate target at 50 ft in about 3 sessions with 100 rounds. Strictly for SD purposes that's good enough. Going to the range once a month and shooting a box should keep the average person to retain that much accuracy, at least for me it did.\n \n \n\n True in my opinion, such as a shotgun or an AR. Some may feel more comfortable with a pistol. Are you making choices for them or just suggestions?\n \n\n \n When people have no clue, do you tell them to use a pistol for HD? There are so many advantages to using a shotgun instead of a pistol for HD that it would be wrong to misguide people in this area.\n \n \n\n I say I have an AR for fun, and HD after my pistol and shotgun. I have never seen a zombie, have you? I do know guys who use AR's for hunting varmints and coyote. Some even use them for boar.\n \n\n Exactly, an ARs use is primarily for fun. Secondarily it could be used for HD, hunting and mid-range firefights. However for the purposes of HD I say shotgun trumps with no other factors.\n \n \n\n I am not treating it like it is nothing. Jamming can happen but an FTFire can happen in a revolver too. True all you have to do is pull the trigger again but with a semi-auto all you have to do is tap the mag and rack the slide. Problem solved. I keep my guns clean though and as I have said I have yet to have a jam in my Glock (3000+ rds. fired). You are right the few chances to be murdered. Your chances of your house burning down are slim as well but I bet you have very modern fire extinguishers and smoke detectors don't you?\n \n\n \n It's much much quicker to pull the trigger again instead of having to reach over, rack the slide and pull the trigger. That half second could mean your life, since an adult can cover 50ft in 2 seconds. What happens if you had to spend more time to clear a jam? What happens if there's a hot load and your gun is stuck? So exactly with your fire extinguisher idea...shouldn't you use a revolver in case it happens?\n \n \n\n Haven't I posted that guns are fun? It is fun to hunt with them. It is fun to plink with them. it is fun to compete with them. Everytime someone does one of these sports it is because it is fun. They are also a good idea for home defense. I guess the point is that people don't have to \"admit\" that they are fun. It is kind of obvious when they are doing things with them other than defending themselves.\n \n\n \n I didn't specifically target you. I used it as a general statement that most of the time I read a gun control thread someone asks \"why you need a gun?\" and you repeatedly see \"for self defense\", but rarely do you see \"for fun\".\n \n \n\n I am starting to get the impression that you want to restrict the types of guns that people own ala California stlye gun control. Why do others care that honest citizens buy guns? The fact that they are honest means that they are not breaking the law.\n\n \n That's entirely in your head. My original post stated the same reason as my following posts as to the topic of this post as being \"people are hard to admit they buy guns for fun as a defense for having guns\".",

   "How else do I interpret this correlation between AR-15, police raids and HD that you referred to? Police use them for entry, not home defense. I see the shotgun having more edge than ars in a pure HD situation.\n  I used entry teams to illustrate that AR-15's were a good choice for a gun fight. If they are good for the police they are just as good for us. You see the shotgun as having an edge. That is your opinion. There are others that disagree. Myself, I use my pistol followed by my shotgun and then my AR or AK as a last resort. \n \n \n \n Police usage of ar-15s is probably not for HD situations. I'm not arguing that the police made the wrong choice of issuing ar-15s for their roles.\n Nor am I.\n \n \n \n It's also a disadvantage to use light 5.56 rounds instead of #00 buckshot. Also, with a shotgun you can use a pump with less chances of jamming. You can also get a semi-auto with detachable 10 round mags for fast reloading. With your target range of max 20 yards inside a house, accuracy difference between a shotgun and AR is not an issue. If anything the shot pattern would have reached a torso sized spread at 20 yards making it more likely to hit than an ar.\n I have not had a jam in my AR since I was in the military but it could happen. And accuracy is an issue. If I have to fire more than one round my follow up shots with the AR will be faster and my grouping will be tighter, this can not be disputed. Remember the recoil is very low on the AR compared to that of a shotgun. As far as 20 mags for the shotgun, yes you are right but I have 30 round mags for the AR. Mags are beside the point though. I have already said that I would go to my shotgun before the AR unless something were to force me to do otherwise such as when Hurricane Charley came through or possibly a New Orleans style incident.\n \n \n Then use a heavier load. A shotgun has so many more power varieties compared to a 5.56.\n I agree, but then we run into the penetration issues that you brought up. Not as much as the AR but still considerable.\n \n \n \n Where is enough? You can go all the way up to 100 round drums for your pistol, which is hard to conceal but not impossible. 6 rounds should be enough and with reliability concerns on the side of autoloaders taking the hit and only getting 6 rounds is a safer solution.\n I already said enough is when the threat is stopped. Have you ever been in a high stress environment and tried to shoot a moving target? No matter how much you train you can still miss. Cops often miss more than they hit. I am sure you have seen all of the high profile shootings. Let's say someone comes after me in my home in the dark I shoot at him with my 5 or 6 shot revolver as he shoots at me. Let's say I hit him 3 out of 6 shots. I know, you will probably say, \"you should be a better shot\". I will remind you of the adrenaline dump and the fact that you and the bad guy are moving around in the dark. So 1 or 2 shots hits center of mass and the 3rd nicks a leg or arm, still a hit but just not significant. It is not uncommon for two hits to have no immediate effect. Often times people do not even know they are shot until after an event like this. This goes for the BG's as well. If the BG has 17 rds in this make believe event then I am royally screwed. I do not buy your reliability concerns. How much shooting have you done in your life? Jamming is just not that much of an issue in a quality modern semi-auto. \n \n \n As above, where are the bad guys who can take 6 .44mags and keep going? If they really are around, we should carry rifles instead.\n Once again you are not assured to hit with all 6 rds. I would like to see you try to double tap with a .44 mag. just to simulate a rapid fire situation. You probably can not do it. I know I can't and I shoot a lot.\n \n \n Then learn to shoot well with the .44 mag. Do you recommend people to use .22lrs for CCW or tell them to take the time and learn to use something heavier?\n I recommend that people carry and shoot the largest caliber that they are comfortable with and can shoot well. Most will never be able to shoot well with a .44 mag. 9mm is popular for this reason. It has a relatively mild recoil allowing easier, faster, and more accurate follow up shots. I would never recommend a .22 lr unless they had no other choice.\n \n As above, for CCW concerns it's not going to be a long range shot. Until they learn to handle the difference they can get a .357/.38 and practice using .38s and go up to .357. There are existing 9mm, .45acp and .40 cal revolvers that are reliable as well, but why do they have to use these rounds?\n True it is not going to be a log range shot but the better you do at long range the better you are at short range. Myself I only practice at 7 yards and then practice at 50 yards for trigger control.\n \n I do not like the penetration of .357 and .38 is a poor choice if you can handle something better. I already acknowledged that there are revolvers in 9mm, .45, and .40. It is just that they are not as easy to find and the choices are limited. I only named those three rounds because they are the most popular rds. used for self defense.\n \n \n \n There's a point where enough is enough. I learned how to hit a paper plate target at 50 ft in about 3 sessions with 100 rounds. Strictly for SD purposes that's good enough. Going to the range once a month and shooting a box should keep the average person to retain that much accuracy, at least for me it did.\n We have already discussed that some people have fun with their guns. Some people may need more training than you. I personally have fun by training. Surely you are not limiting the amount of training or fun people should have. As far as being good enough for SD, there are many people that disagree with that. I don't think that you are qualified to determine that for others. If you are then let me know.\n \n \n When people have no clue, do you tell them to use a pistol for HD? There are so many advantages to using a shotgun instead of a pistol for HD that it would be wrong to misguide people in this area.\n When people have no clue I tell them to get one before they get a gun.\n \n As far as pistol over shotgun/shotgun over pistol; I will remind you that a pistol is much more maneuverable than a shotgun. I have both by my bed but I grab my pistol first when something suspicious is going on, saving the shotgun for when I know something is going on. Many people are split on this issue as well. I don't think I will take your opinion as fact. I will write it off as preference.\n \n Exactly, an ARs use is primarily for fun. Secondarily it could be used for HD, hunting and mid-range firefights. However for the purposes of HD I say shotgun trumps with no other factors.\n I roll fun and hunting in as one. That leaves HD. You are mostly right but there are times and places where I would like the AR. In remote farm country for example. No neighbors to worry about. No kids or wife if I were single. I would much rather have an AR over a shotgun in this example. I am obviously on the edge between the shotty and the AR. Once again it comes down to preference. I am highly trained on the AR. Less so on the shotty. That is why I don't divide the two as clearly as you. There are many, many others out there just like me. As well as those that choose the AR.\n \n \n It's much much quicker to pull the trigger again instead of having to reach over, rack the slide and pull the trigger. That half second could mean your life, since an adult can cover 50ft in 2 seconds. What happens if you had to spend more time to clear a jam? What happens if there's a hot load and your gun is stuck? So exactly with your fire extinguisher idea...shouldn't you use a revolver in case it happens?\n That is why we weigh the odds and make choices based on our opinions. I value more rds. and do not see jamming as an issue. You think a jam is assured and value the simplicity of a revolver. I have no problem with that. I just choose differently. I think my reasoning is more prevalent hence my answer to your original question as to why so many semi-auto's.\n \n No, you should not use a revolver like a fire extinguisher. A semi-auto is a much more advanced design and in my opinion offers more advantages.\n \n I didn't specifically target you. I used it as a general statement that most of the time I read a gun control thread someone asks \"why you need a gun?\" and you repeatedly see \"for self defense\", but rarely do you see \"for fun\".\n Understood. Now you have seen someone say it is for fun. As I have said before, hunting is also for fun so I think you should include that into the fun category.\n \n \n That's entirely in your head. My original post stated the same reason as my following posts as to the topic of this post as being \"people are hard to admit they buy guns for fun as a defense for having guns\".\n\n \n I am people and I freely admit that they are fun. I need no defense for having guns. How do you know these \"people\" are telling a lie? Maybe they do buy them for defense. Maybe both. I am on the both team.\n \n I still get the impression that you do not like the choices people make regarding firearms. It may be in my head but it was put there by your words.",

   "Let me interject myself for a moment and take a swing at the question of \"why do you need a gun?\" I've had anti-gunners ask me this question before. Here is my smart-XXX answer to that question:\n \n I can think of several reasons to own a gun. I could hunt with it. I could have fun shooting tin cans with it. I could practice with it and try to represent my country at the Olympics with it. I could use it for home defense. I could use it for personal protection when I am away from home. I don't have to have any reason to own a gun, but it just so happens that I do have some reasons. And the time is not right yet for you to be entitled to know my reasons. Oh, I know you now want to ask \"When, Bryan, will that blessed day come-that day when I am entitled to demand that you gird your loins like a man and justify to me why you bought a gun?\" Here is when I think that time will be:\n \n It will be when I am entitled to demand that a person justify his reasons for refusing to consent to a police search of his car-it will be when I become entitled to demand to know why he asserted his right to counsel and refused to answer my officer's questions-it will be when I no longer need to obtain a search warrant to break into your home and rifle through your dresser drawers-it will be when I find a KJV Bible in your house and feel entitled to demand that you justify to me why you own that Bible, and to know your reasons for having a KJV instead of a Good News translation-it will be when I become entitled to demand that you tell me whether that Bible is for personal use or will it be used to convert others to your faith. \n \n When these things come to pass, then you will know that the long-desired time has indeed come. That will be the day when the Constitution will no longer protect me from your seizure of the power to review and veto my personal decisions regarding how I will exercise my individual rights. But since the day has not yet come for your ascension to that throne of tyranny, I feel no particular need to justify to you why I might choose to exercise any right my Constitution protects. \n \n ---\n \n \"The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.\" Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, Lecture II, 1921.\n \n \"The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground.\"-Thomas Jefferson\n \n \"The saddest epitaph which can be carved in memory of a vanished liberty is that it was lost because its possessors failed to stretch forth a saving hand while yet there was time.\"-Justice George Sutherland",

   "\n I used entry teams to illustrate that AR-15's were a good choice for a gun fight. If they are good for the police they are just as good for us. You see the shotgun as having an edge. That is your opinion. There are others that disagree. Myself, I use my pistol followed by my shotgun and then my AR or AK as a last resort.\n \n\n The fights conducted by police raid units are usually different than one conducted by a homeowner. There are extraneous requirements for the police that is not imposed on the homeowner. \n \n \n\n I have not had a jam in my AR since I was in the military but it could happen. And accuracy is an issue. If I have to fire more than one round my follow up shots with the AR will be faster and my grouping will be tighter, this can not be disputed. Remember the recoil is very low on the AR compared to that of a shotgun. As far as 20 mags for the shotgun, yes you are right but I have 30 round mags for the AR. Mags are beside the point though. I have already said that I would go to my shotgun before the AR unless something were to force me to do otherwise such as when Hurricane Charley came through or possibly a New Orleans style incident.\n \n\n I disagree. The shotgun is going to be heavier unless you are using a 20'' varmint barreled AR. The shotgun can also be loaded with shells of equivalent power or less power than a 5.56 thereby making recoil the same or more managable.\n \n \n\n I agree, but then we run into the penetration issues that you brought up. Not as much as the AR but still considerable.\n \n\n Anything that can penetrate to get to vital organs will penetrate several layers of drywall. There is no option around this even frangible rounds will go through several layers. Therefore, over penetration should be a given no matter what you chose. (Unless you chose birdshot, which still has tactical advantages and is an available option if you use a shotgun).\n \n \n\n I already said enough is when the threat is stopped. Have you ever been in a high stress environment and tried to shoot a moving target? No matter how much you train you can still miss. Cops often miss more than they hit. I am sure you have seen all of the high profile shootings. Let's say someone comes after me in my home in the dark I shoot at him with my 5 or 6 shot revolver as he shoots at me. Let's say I hit him 3 out of 6 shots. I know, you will probably say, \"you should be a better shot\". I will remind you of the adrenaline dump and the fact that you and the bad guy are moving around in the dark. So 1 or 2 shots hits center of mass and the 3rd nicks a leg or arm, still a hit but just not significant. It is not uncommon for two hits to have no immediate effect. Often times people do not even know they are shot until after an event like this. This goes for the BG's as well. If the BG has 17 rds in this make believe event then I am royally screwed.\n \n\n For a CCW situation, it is more than likely that you are in an environment where you should not take a shot that you are unsure of. Missing can have dire consequences especially if you are in a populated area. There may not be people present, but your shot can still deflect or over penetrate into areas populated. Stressing training is the only thing to be done at this point. So therefore you should have been a better shot. An \"adrenaline pump\" can make it difficult to take your shot, but it won't make it impossible, especially considering the distances you will be dealing with in a pure SD situation. You can train stressed shooting.\n \n \n\n I do not buy your reliability concerns. How much shooting have you done in your life? Jamming is just not that much of an issue in a quality modern semi-auto.\n \n\n \n How many fires have you had at your house? Do you still buy fire extinguishers? You brought this example up yourself. It is not a negligible statistic. \n \n \n\n Once again you are not assured to hit with all 6 rds. I would like to see you try to double tap with a .44 mag. just to simulate a rapid fire situation. You probably can not do it. I know I can't and I shoot a lot.\n \n\n \n I live in the city. Rapid firing is not an option in most places in my daily routine. This may be different in rural areas or some other situation I can't think of.\n \n \n\n I recommend that people carry and shoot the largest caliber that they are comfortable with and can shoot well. Most will never be able to shoot well with a .44 mag. 9mm is popular for this reason. It has a relatively mild recoil allowing easier, faster, and more accurate follow up shots. I would never recommend a .22 lr unless they had no other choice.\n \n\n People should learn to move to the largest caliber then can handle. Learning to handle recoil is either a mental handicap or a physical handicap. For most of us without a physical handicap, learning to shoot and dealing with recoil is a practicing issue to get over the mental handicap. \n \n \n\n True it is not going to be a log range shot but the better you do at long range the better you are at short range. Myself I only practice at 7 yards and then practice at 50 yards for trigger control.\n \n\n If you can qualify your precision at the range you will be using for the whole purpose of SD then there is little need to go beyond. Unless for fun...\n \n \n\n I do not like the penetration of .357 and .38 is a poor choice if you can handle something better. I already acknowledged that there are revolvers in 9mm, .45, and .40. It is just that they are not as easy to find and the choices are limited. I only named those three rounds because they are the most popular rds. used for self defense.\n \n\n They are the most popular because they are more commonly available for auto-loaders. 100 years ago that wouldn't be the case. You are going to get penetration issues with pretty much any caliber.\n \n \n\n We have already discussed that some people have fun with their guns. Some people may need more training than you. I personally have fun by training. Surely you are not limiting the amount of training or fun people should have. As far as being good enough for SD, there are many people that disagree with that. I don't think that you are qualified to determine that for others. If you are then let me know.\n \n\n Actually that's not me, it's stated by the DPS for my state. In order to qualify for a CCW license, applicants must pass a range test on a 45'' by 24'' silhouette at a maximum range of 15 yards and with a minimum of 2 seconds between shots. You are starting to drift from my point on this topic, which is that if people wanted a handgun purely for SD they would not need to be at the range so much as to incur thousands of dollars of expenses each year. Having fun at the range will of course justify a new reason as to why they own a handgun.\n \n \n\n As far as pistol over shotgun/shotgun over pistol; I will remind you that a pistol is much more maneuverable than a shotgun. I have both by my bed but I grab my pistol first when something suspicious is going on, saving the shotgun for when I know something is going on. Many people are split on this issue as well. I don't think I will take your opinion as fact. I will write it off as preference.\n \n\n Bringing enough firepower should trump over minor maneuverability issues. There should be a strategy developed where family members convene at an easily defensible point of the house and you don't need to maneuver to clear areas. I may agree with your strategy if you had someone behind you with a shotgun.\n \n \n\n I roll fun and hunting in as one. That leaves HD. You are mostly right but there are times and places where I would like the AR. In remote farm country for example. No neighbors to worry about. No kids or wife if I were single. I would much rather have an AR over a shotgun in this example. I am obviously on the edge between the shotty and the AR. Once again it comes down to preference. I am highly trained on the AR. Less so on the shotty. That is why I don't divide the two as clearly as you. There are many, many others out there just like me. As well as those that choose the AR.\n \n\n Preference by training can simply be changed by training with the other weapon. There may be situations in rural areas where combining a hunting/defense firearm may be advantageous as a NEED, but I fail to see how they give an advantage otherwise.\n \n \n\n That is why we weigh the odds and make choices based on our opinions. I value more rds. and do not see jamming as an issue. You think a jam is assured and value the simplicity of a revolver. I have no problem with that. I just choose differently. I think my reasoning is more prevalent hence my answer to your original question as to why so many semi-auto's.\n \n\n Jamming is a noticeable risk. I am a proponent of more power/reliability versus more capacity. There must be a line drawn somewhere, else everyone would have calico 100 round drum .22 pistols. 6 shots should serve most needs for SD otherwise more training is required.\n \n \n\n I am people and I freely admit that they are fun. I need no defense for having guns. How do you know these \"people\" are telling a lie? Maybe they do buy them for defense. Maybe both. I am on the both team.\n \n\n Then you would not be inclusive of \"most people I see\". The purpose of my argument is that I call them out when they propose using ar-15s for purely for HD and semi-autos purely for SD.\n \n \n\n I still get the impression that you do not like the choices people make regarding firearms. It may be in my head but it was put there by your words.\n \n\n \n I do dislike some people's choices regarding firearms. If purely for SD/HD a revolver/shotgun combo is optimal. Adding recreation is another matter. Would you dislike someone's choice of using a .22lr for defense?",

   "As far as the AR vs. the Shotty It seems we disagree on about every issue. You say that you can change your load in the shotty to reduce your recoil but I have already stated that I do not like the idea of defending myself with birdshot. Simply put, if someone chose the AR over the shotgun I could very well understand their decision.\n \n When I mentioned adrenaline dump I spoke from some experience. I had extensive training in the Army with the M-16. Trust me, you will not be as accurate as you think when a target presents itself. In my situation a shotgun would have probably got me killed. Not because it is ineffective but because the AR/M-16 is faster with followup shots. I still value the shotty for typical civilian use but can understand why someone might prefer the AR.\n \n With regards to the semi. vs. revolver, my comments about the fire extinguisher still stand. I have modern examples of chemical style extinguishers. I do not have the old pressurized water filled ones. The would both work but I choose the chemical variety. Revolvers and semi's would both work for SD but I choose a semi. I am a better shot with my semi than my revolver. I can shoot faster with more accuracy. Not everyone is the same in that regard, let them choose accordingly. I will remind you that 6 shots is enough for you but may not be enough for someone else. If someone want to carry a 100 rd. drum of .22 so be it. I think I already addressed this but I will state it again. I do not recommend anyone use a .22 for self defense UNLESS it is the only weapon available or for some reason it is the only weapon you can shoot well. There are other calibers out there that most people should be able to handle, be it in a revolver or a semi auto.\n \n The training that people need is determined differently in different states. I don't think people should be forced to train just to own and carry a firearm. I know it sounds dangerous but I see it as an infringement on our rights. I am not the one to say who is trained enough and who is not, I will try to only speak for myself. I suggest you do the same. If someone makes a mistake and hurts another person then let them be responsible for their error. \n \n On the fun issue, Half of the reason why most people shoot is probably for fun. It is no secret, that is why people hunt(it's fun), that is why people go to the range(not just for proficiency). I understand that most people whom you have contact with have not told you so but I believe it to be true. As I said before I think it is obvious. Guns are a blast!!!\n \n Would you ever consider limiting people's choices of guns? For example, would you make it harder or impossible for someone to buy an semi auto pistol or an AR-15 via laws or regulations? How do you feel about mag capacity limits?",

   "Let me address the issue raised in this thread of self-defense and shooting after an attacker \"goes down.\" Shooting an attacker after they \"go down\" can be criminal. The right of self defense is not an automatic right to kill someone who threatens you. The right of self defense is often called a law of necessity, and this is because it makes it lawful to engage in violent conduct (like shooting someone) that is ordinarily criminal. \n \n There are two (although these are not the only two) important qualifications to the right of self defense:\n \n 1. In exercising self-defense you can use no more force than was reasonably necessary to prevent the harm threatened, and in particular you cannot apply or use deadly force in self-defense unless you reasonably feared, under the circumstances as they appeared to you, that you or another innocent person was in danger of being killed or in danger of suffering great bodily harm. Violating this is termed using excessive force and is criminal conduct. \n 2. The right to assault another in self-defense ends when the threat ends and you have a reasonable opportunity to see and understand that the threat has ended. Violating this is typically viewed as retaliation or acting out of a motive for revenge, and is criminal conduct. \n \n These are some of the old common law rules for self defense, and they are the current law in my state of Virginia. Please bear in mind that the law may be different in other states, but these rules tend to be uniform. \n \n An example of violating rule #1 would be shooting a 10 year old who threatens to whip you with a switch. You have a right to defend yourself from his threatened assault, but not to respond with deadly force. \n \n An example involving rule #2 would be shooting someone 6 times while they continue to advance upon you with a knife. This, in my opinion, would not constitute using excessive force or retaliating. Once you are threatened with death or great bodily harm, then you can continue to respond with deadly force, even to the point of killing the aggressor, until the threat to you ends. But that is where the right ends. To take the example further: Let's say you shoot the same knife-wielder once and watch him fall to the ground and drop the knife. Then you walk over to him and shoot him again while he is on the ground. This would violate rule #2. You were justified in using deadly force for the first shot, but the second shot would be viewed as retaliating because the threat has ended and you have had an opportunity to realize this and understand it was no longer necessary to protect yourself by shooting him again. \n \n ---\n \n \"And indeed, gentlemen, there exists a law, not written down anywhere but written in our hearts; a law which comes to us not by training or custom or reading but by derivation and absorption and adoption from nature itself; a law which has come to us not by theory but from practice, not by instruction but by natural intuition. I refer to the law which lays it down that, if our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right. When weapons reduce them to silence, the laws no longer expect one to await their pronouncements. For people who decide to wait for these will have to wait for justice, too--and meanwhile they must suffer injustice first. Indeed, even the wisdom of the law itself, by a sort of tacit implication, permits self- defense, because it does not actually forbid men to kill; what it does, instead, is to forbid the bearing of a weapon with the intention to kill. When, therefore, an inquiry passes beyond the mere question of the weapon and starts to consider the motive, a man who has used arms in self-defense is not regarded as having carried them with homicidal aim\". Cicero, Selected Political Speeches, p. 222 (M. Grant, trans. 1975)\n \n \"If a slave, says Plato, defends himself, and kills a freeman, he ought to be treated as a parricide. This is a civil law which punishes self-defense, though dictated by nature. . . .\n \n It is unreasonable. . .to oblige a man not to attempt the defense of his own life. . . .\n Who does not see that self-defense is a duty superior to every precept. . . .\n \n [T]he laws of an Italian republic [Venice], where bearing fire-arms is punished as a capital crime and where it is not more fatal to make an ill use of them than to carry them, is not agreeable to the nature of things.\"\n \n Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws, pp. 59, 60, 64, and 79-80 (trans. T. Nugent, 1899).\n \n \"And I cannot see, why arms should be denied to any man who is not a slave, since they are the only true badges of liberty. . . .The possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave. He who has nothing, and belongs to another, must be defended by him, and needs no arms: but he who thinks he is his own master, and has anything he may call his own, ought to have arms to defend himself and what he possesses, or else he lives precariously and at discretion. And though for a while those who have the sword in their power abstain from doing him injury; yet, by degrees, he will be awed into submission to every arbitrary command.\" Andrew Fletcher, Political Works, pp. 35 and 221 (1749)\n \n \"And we have seen that these rights [in the 1688 English Bill of Rights]. . .consist, primarily, in the free enjoyment of personal security, of personal liberty, and of private property. So long as these remain inviolate, the subject is perfectly free; for every species of compulsive tyranny and oppression must act in opposition to one or other of these rights. To preserve these from violation, it is necessary that the constitution of parliaments be supported in it[s] full vigor. . . .And lastly, to vindicate these rights, when actually violated or attacked, the subjects of England are entitled, in the first place, to the regular administration and free course of justice in the courts of law; next to the right of petitioning the king and parliament for redress of grievances; and lastly, to the right of having and using arms for self preservation and defense.\" Sir William Blackstone, 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England, p. 140 (1st. ed. 1765, reprinted 1979).\n \n \"Instances of the licentious and outrageous behavior of the military conservators of the peace still multiply upon us, some of which are of such a nature, and have been carried to so great lengths, as must serve fully to evince that a late vote of this town, calling upon the inhabitants to provide themselves with arms for their defense, was a measure as prudent as it was legal. . . .It is a natural right which the people have reserved to themselves, confirmed by the [1688 English] Bill of Rights, to keep arms for their defense; and as Mr. Blackstone observes, it is to be made use of when the sanctions of society and law are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression. \n \n It is certainly beyond human art and sophistry, to prove that the British subjects, to whom the privilege of possessing arms is expressly recognized by the Bill of Rights,. . .are guilty of an illegal act, in calling upon one another to be provided with them, as the law directs.\"\n \n O. Dickerson ed., Boston Under Military Rule, p79 & 61 (1936) [quoting from what was at the time the most widely circulated periodical in the colonies, A Journal of the Times].\n \n \"The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.\" Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia, in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300\n \n \"The inhabitants of Boston being confined within that town by the general their governor, and having, in order to procure their dismission, entered into a treaty with him, it was stipulated that the said inhabitants having deposited their arms with their own magistrates, should have liberty to depart, taking with them their own effects. They accordingly delivered up their arms, but in open violation of honor, in defiance of the obligation of treaties, which even savage nations esteemed sacred, the governor ordered the arms deposited as aforesaid, that they might be preserved for their owners, to be seized by a body of soldiers; detained the greatest part of the inhabitants in the town, and compelled the few who were permitted to retire, to leave their most valuable effects behind.\" From the DECLARATION OF THE CAUSES AND NECESSITY OF TAKING UP ARMS (July 6, 1775).",

   "On a slightly different note, I thought some of you would find this funny.\n \n 40 Reasons to Ban Guns \n \n \n 1. Banning guns works, which is why New York, DC, Detroit & Chicago cops need guns.\n \n 2. Washington DC's low murder rate of 69 per 100,000 is due to strict gun control, and Indianapolis' high murder rate of 9 per 100,000 is due to the lack of gun control.\n \n 3. Statistics showing high murder rates justify gun control but statistics showing increasing murder rates after gun control are \"just statistics.\"\n \n 4. The Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban, both of which went into effect in 1994 are responsible for the decrease in violent crime rates, which have been declining since 1991.\n \n 5. We must get rid of guns because a deranged lunatic may go on a shooting spree at any time and anyone who would own a gun out of fear of such a lunatic is paranoid.\n \n 6. The more helpless you are the safer you are from criminals.\n \n 7. An intruder will be incapacitated by tear gas or oven spray, but if shot with a .357 Magnum will get angry and kill you.\n \n 8. A woman raped and strangled is morally superior to a woman with a smoking gun and a dead rapist at her feet.\n \n 9. When confronted by violent criminals, you should \"put up no defense - give them what they want, or run\" (Handgun Control Inc. Chairman Pete Shields, Guns Don't Die - People Do, 1981, p. 125).\n \n 10. The New England Journal of Medicine is filled with expert advice about guns; just like Guns & Ammo has some excellent treatises on heart surgery.\n \n 11. One should consult an automotive engineer for safer seat belts, a civil engineer for a better bridge, a surgeon for internal medicine, a computer programmer for hard drive problems, and Sarah Brady for firearms expertise.\n \n 12. The 2nd Amendment, ratified in 1787, refers to the National Guard, which was created 130 years later, in 1917.\n \n 13. The National Guard, federally funded, with bases on federal land, using federally-owned weapons, vehicles, buildings and uniforms, punishing trespassers under federal law, is a \"state\" militia.\n \n 14. These phrases: \"right of the people peaceably to assemble,\" \"right of the people to be secure in their homes,\" \"enumerations herein of certain rights shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the people,\" and \"The powers not delegated herein are reserved to the states respectively, and to the people\" all refer to individuals, but \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms\" refers to the state.\n \n 15. \"The Constitution is strong and will never change.\" But we should ban and seize all guns thereby violating the 2nd, 4th, and 5th Amendments to that Constitution.\n \n 16. Rifles and handguns aren't necessary to national defense! Of course, the army has hundreds of thousands of them.\n \n 17. Private citizens shouldn't have handguns, because they aren't \"military weapons'', but private citizens shouldn't have \"assault rifles'', because they are military weapons.\n \n 18. In spite of waiting periods, background checks, fingerprinting, government forms, etc., guns today are too readily available, which is responsible for recent school shootings. In the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's, anyone could buy guns at hardware stores, army surplus stores, gas stations, variety stores, Sears mail order, no waiting, no background check, no fingerprints, no government forms and there were no school shootings.\n \n 19. The NRA's attempt to run a \"don't touch\" campaign about kids handling guns is propaganda, but the anti-gun lobby's attempt to run a \"don't touch\" campaign is responsible social activity.\n \n 20. Guns are so complex that special training is necessary to use them properly, and so simple to use that they make murder easy.\n \n 21. A handgun, with up to 4 controls, is far too complex for the typical adult to learn to use, as opposed to an automobile that only has 20.\n \n 22. Women are just as intelligent and capable as men but a woman with a gun is \"an accident waiting to happen\" and gun makers' advertisements aimed at women are \"preying on their fears.\"\n \n 23. Ordinary people in the presence of guns turn into slaughtering butchers but revert to normal when the weapon is removed.\n \n 24. Guns cause violence, which is why there are so many mass killings at gun shows.\n \n 25. A majority of the population supports gun control, just like a majority of the population supported owning slaves.\n \n 26. Any self-loading small arm can legitimately be considered to be a \"weapon of mass destruction\" or an \"assault weapon.\"\n \n 27. Most people can't be trusted, so we should have laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.\n \n 28. The right of Internet pornographers to exist cannot be questioned because it is constitutionally protected by the Bill of Rights, but the use of handguns for self defense is not really protected by the Bill of Rights.\n \n 29. Free speech entitles one to own newspapers, transmitters, computers, and typewriters, but self- defense only justifies bare hands. \n \n 30. The ACLU is good because it uncompromisingly defends certain parts of the Constitution, and the NRA is bad, because it defends other parts of the Constitution.\n \n 31. Charlton Heston, a movie actor as president of the NRA is a cheap lunatic who should be ignored, but Michael Douglas, a movie actor as a representative of Handgun Control, Inc. is an ambassador for peace who is entitled to an audience at the UN arms control summit.\n \n 32. Police operate with backup within groups, which is why they need larger capacity pistol magazines than do \"civilians\" who must face criminals alone and therefore need less ammunition.\n \n 33. We should ban \"Saturday Night Specials\" and other inexpensive guns because it's not fair that poor people have access to guns too.\n \n 34. Police officers have some special Jedi-like mastery over handguns that private citizens can never hope to obtain.\n \n 35. Private citizens don't need a gun for self- protection because the police are there to protect them even though the Supreme Court says the police are not responsible for their protection.\n \n 36. Citizens don't need to carry a gun for personal protection but police chiefs, who are desk-bound administrators who work in a building filled with cops, need a gun.\n \n 37. \"Assault weapons\" have no purpose other than to kill large numbers of people. The police need assault weapons. You do not.\n \n 38. When Microsoft pressures its distributors to give Microsoft preferential promotion, that's bad; but when the Federal government pressures cities to buy guns only from Smith & Wesson, that's good.\n \n 39. Trigger locks do not interfere with the ability to use a gun for defensive purposes, which is why you see police officers with one on their duty weapon.\n \n 40. Handgun Control, Inc., says they want to \"keep guns out of the wrong hands.\" Guess what? You have the wrong hands.",

I suspect we are in agreement.\n \n \n \n There's no need for that unless you can explain to me physically how a heavier gun with the same amount of gun powder in it could possibly recoil more than a lighter gun with the same amount of gun powder in it.\n \n You can easily pull your trigger finger faster on an AR-15 than you can work the action on a pump and then pull the trigger. You would do better with a semi shotty but the loads you would have to use to equal the speed of an AR would simply not be as effective. Simple. You do not have to believe me, go try it yourself.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n That decision may lie with the shooter, but realize a stray bullet damaging property/people is still a crime in this situation. One should not ENCOURAGE that type of behavior. You are going to have to explain what you mean by \"can not use\". Physically incapable means suffering harm from firing such cartridges for that I give leeway for having a legitimate reason to use a lighter cartridge.\n \n \"can not use\" as in unable to fire accurately and I am not encouraging any bad behavior. I have stated that one should use the largest caliber that one can operate proficiently and accurately.\n \n \n \n The 2nd Amendment and the bill of rights when written was claimed as a \"god given right\". That means everyone, not just law abiding citizens. Every single person in this country should be able to purchase any form of ARMS, be they criminal or non-citizens.\n\n \n And we disagree about this, where?\n \n By the way,\n \n \"Would you ever consider limiting people's choices of guns? For example, would you make it harder or impossible for someone to buy an semi auto pistol or an AR-15 via laws or regulations? How do you feel about mag capacity limits?\"\n \n I am just curious.\n \n I assume your stance on the 2A means that your answer to the first part of the question is \"no\". Would that be fair? What about the last part?",

   "What is it in their society that makes them so scared ?\n \n It pains me to say that in US society, poverty and other injustices run rampant. Although a majority of this is caused by themselves, people try to find someone to blame. Unfortunately, there is no telling if that someone will be you, a relative, or a close friend. Even if guns werent available, these people so bent on revenge willfind some other object with which to commit their action. I would rather have my own firearm ready to combat these villains if (God forbid) they ever invade my home, than to be stuck with them holding one weapon to my none. It is for the same reason that I educate my family on the proper usage of firearms.\n Do you want a real reason to be scared of gun control? One of Hitler's first acts was to make Germany \"safer\" by slowly restricting firearms and eventually banning them. In six years, thirteen million were exterminated without a defense. One of Stalin's first acts was to make the USSR \"safer\" by slowly restricting firearms and eventually banning them. In twenty-four years, twenty million were exterminated without a defense. In China, communist rulers made it a priority to make China \"safer\" by slowly restricting firearms and eventually banning them. In fifty-eight years, twenty million were exterminated without a defense. Leaders made Turkey \"safer\" by slowly restricting firearms and eventually banning them. In two years, 1.5 million were exterminated without a defense.\n Also, guns are not all about self defense. I've been around firearms since I was a toddler, and hunt or target shoot regularly. To me, shooting is more of a hobby and more for enjoyment purposes than defense. That's just one more added benefit.",

Why not? \n Indeed, it looks like a well-planned diversion, directed to serious undermining of our economy in its agricultural sector. It is enough to remember that previous outbreak of foot and mouth in 2001 cost us 8 milliard pounds sterling!

   "Christopher M Gibson / Compilation of other Sources\n 2 November 2008\n Second Amendment: The Right to Bear ArmsThe Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States America states that, \"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" With much controversy, the right to bear arms has been disputed for many years. Do weapons benefit our community or is it the contrary? Should we be for the use of weapons such as guns or against? Guns do benefit the community when not in the hands of a negligent user. We keep guns for our personal protection from the world that surrounds us. Unfortunately we keep them to protect us primarily from other people who possess guns. A famous slogan by the Colt firearm manufacturer stated, \"God made man, but Sam Colt made man equal.\" This is an odd way to look at things, but isn't it true? The weak are inadequate to the strong without some kind of defense; thus, weapons are produced to protect the individual in foreign and domestic attack. In a desperate struggle to save herself from being raped and abused, a 57-year old woman from St. Louis shot and killed her assailant. She had been beaten and raped only a week before by the same man, and when attempting to rape the woman again the attacker met his match, a shotgun. Police will not persecute the woman because she acted in self-defense. (Ratcliffe) In moments of peril, what would you do? Weapons are made for defense. This woman was alone in a dark home and was defenseless without her gun. She had been desecrated and left with a sense of being worthless and used. She did what she had to do to protect herself from this man before he committed this terrible act again. \n As many as 200,00 women use a gun every year to defend themselves against sexual abuse. (RTKBA) Having a gun for one's personal protection is a justified means of self-defense. Dick Heller, a D.C. special policeman, registered for a personal handgun used for self-defense in the home. He was rejected based on the law in D.C. that states that no gun is permitted unless used by law enforcement or registered before 1975. Heller and some lawyers pursued a case stating that prohibiting firearms in D.C violates the Second Amendment. The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit's Judge Henderson claims that the District of Columbia is not a state and that it doesn't fall under the amendment. (Heller) The District of Columbia is the capital of the United States and for some reason Judge Henderson doesn't think that the Second Amendment applies to it. After surpassing the Court of Appeals, Heller's group took the case to the Supreme Court where the decision was made to rid of D.C. gun law that violates the Second Amendment. Washington D.C. was once known as the \"murder capital\" of the United States. By 2006, the crime rate had dropped drastically due to the District of Columbia v. Heller case. (Washington, D.C.) Having driven the issue, Dick Heller not only regained his rights to possess a handgun, but also helped the community's crime rate lower. Willie Wood, a store clerk in Greenville, South Carolina, stumbled across the misfortune of being robbed one evening. The two robbers, one armed with a knife and the other a pistol, demanded Willie to give them all of his money in the cash register. He hesitantly handed over his daily earnings of $3000 and refused to get on the ground when commanded to. The gunman shot Willie once in the hand and it skimmed his chest. The gunman ran for the car and the other jumped over the counter tackling the wounded clerk to the ground. Willie's mother, hearing the fight from the other room, came running to help him by latching onto the suspect and trying to pull him away. In the battle, Willie's mother was fatally stabbed in the chest. Willie grabbed his pistol from underneath his shirt and squeezed five rounds of into the suspect, killing him instantly. (Yates v. Evatt) It is in cases like these where store clerks have to fend for themselves against armed robbers. Robbers usually have a well-planned scenario and firearms to supply the fear factor. Willie did the right thing to arm himself with a handgun to protect his store and himself. It is the right of any persons claiming citizenship in this country to own a firearm. The Second Amendment of the United States protects that right. I believe that everyone should own a firearm with no intentions to use it in a harmful manner. Guns are used for protection against the evils of this world and it's hard to do without. In two different cases, I have enlightened you with stories of victims having to use guns for their safety from those evils. There are different views on gun control and during this election each side has an opposing standpoint. On one side, McCain is for the use of guns and on the other Obama would like to get rid of guns; either way has its pros and cons. I feel that even if guns were taken away that violence would still be in existence. Guns only make your world a safer place when you use it for your defense. So I ask: Pro gun or no gun? \n \n \n \n Word Count: 882",
