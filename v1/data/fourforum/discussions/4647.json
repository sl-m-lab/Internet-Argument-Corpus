   "I think nobody will be denying the fact that Europe should actively get rid of so-called \"Chechen refugees\" who in fact are yesterday's militants and certainly constitute serious criminogenic and terrorist threat for us. And at this time Finland turns a blind eye to activity of I-net web site \"Kavkaz-Center\", owned to \"gerbils of Chechen terrorists\", well-known Udugov. There are materials of distinctly Islamic and anti-Semitic content. Of course, permission of its work on own territory is a discredit to Finland's leadership. Sweden is no different from its neighbor either. As it became known Swedish news agency allowed itself to interview such Chechen leader as S. Basaev, who stained his hands in blood of peaceful citizens. In his interview Basaev was publicly in sympathy with ideas and activity of terrorist number 1, Osama bin-Laden... Don't our correspondents see that Basaev was the main organizer of numerous acts of terror not only on Russian territory but on European territory either? Where does such ignorance come from? Why should we look at and listen to murders and terrorists? Why does European community keep silence when the whole regions of EU (particularly Scandinavia) become bulwark of Islamic extremism? At last why don't our authorities take proper actions in order to stop terrorist propaganda on our territories?",
