   "MICHAEL STRAVATO / New York Times News Service \n Discussing AIDS and dating after viewing \"Not a Day Goes By\" were (clockwise from left): Harliesica Wooten, Somayya Scott, Misha King, Deatree Durham and Tracy Scott (front). \n HOUSTON - Once a week, five friends, all members of the Abundant Life Cathedral, get together to eat sushi, sip wine and talk. \n \n But one recent afternoon, the women chose a different activity: They went to see \"Not a Day Goes By,\" a musical about black men on the \"down low\" who, while not calling themselves gay or bisexual, have sex with other men, often without the knowledge of their wives and girlfriends. \n \n \n http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040405/news_1n5aids.html.\n \n \n After reading this, I'm beginning to wonder if it \"wiser\" for black women to date/reproduce with real MEN outside of the race? Instead of AIDS infected babies without Fathers/ Masculinity/ Strength ect....\n Instead of being victims to deceptive and vile liars, sick and both heads, and worthy of Hell and Fire..\n \n \n \n \n \n AIDS FEARS GROW FOR BLACK WOMEN \n \n By LINDA VILLAROSA (NYT) 1759 words \n Late Edition - Final , Section A , Page 1 , Column 1 \n \n ABSTRACT - Number of black American women who have been infected with HIV through heterosexual sex is rising; experts say risk is tied to bisexual male partners; recent studies suggest that 30 percent of all black bisexual men may be infected with HIV, and up to 90 percent of those men do not know they are infected; researchers for Centers for Disease Control refer to these men as 'bridge' to infection from gay men to heterosexual women; tangle of factors heightens risk for black women; blacks make up 12 percent of nation's population but account for 42 percent of people living with AIDS and more than half of all new infections; experts say blacks tend to have sexual relations with other blacks, which works to confine virus within African-American 'sexual network'; cite wide gap between number of black women and black men in country, saying shortage of available black men can contribute to spread of HIV among black women; photo (M) http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40E15FC355D0C768CDDAD0894DC404482\n \n \n \n \n \n \n In the United States, the impact of HIV and AIDS in the African American community has been devastating. *Through December 1999, CDC had received reports of 733,374 AIDS cases-of those, 272,881 cases occurred among African Americans. \n \n \n Representing only an estimated 12% of the total U.S. population, African Americans make up almost 37% of all AIDS cases reported in this country.* Researchers estimate that 240,000-325,000 African Americans-about 1 in 50 African American men and 1 in 160 AfricanAmerican women-are infected with HIV. \n \n Of those infected with HIV, it is estimated that almost 118,000 African Americans were living with AIDS at the end of 1998. http://www.tgsrm.org/HIV-AIDS.html",

Spirit? Body? Soul?\n \n \n \nReal men get aids too.\n\n \n \n \n Hopefully not through \" choosing\" the paraphilie road, masculinity, in all its glory, just went down the sewer( literally) likewise, betraying/ and infection innocent black women and bringing repercussions/saddness upon the children, and then pretending to be a Holy saints while degrading/ and defaming black women/daughters/ sisters ect..... 24/7\n \n Should Black women not be heated? Should black women ignore the CDC warning? Either heed the warning or take the chance, and a high chance, of becoming infected? Nor do we, like any other normal woman, desire AIDS infected babies with sissies for Fathers-\n \n Nevertheless, I do understand that the black race must be preserved in America, therefore, black women must considering the kinda character of Africa men and what they can bring to their lives, for example, considering the hardships, trials, and tribulations, likewise, the heart breaks, and devastation's inflicted upon them from AIDS, would they not be stronger mates ? If African american women will understand these words, and take interest in the roots,the results will bring forth strong black men?",

   "I suspect that with the growing acceptance of inter racial marrige, the future of America holds an entirly new race. One made up of a combination of several different ethnicities in one person. Certainly there will be some people that stick to there cultures and preserve their past but as the society progresses the ties to the old cultures get looser and looser.",

   "Don't blame the problem on one particular group, AIDS is a problem that affects everyone. Sure, black men do bring HIV home to their innocent black partners, but so do white straight men, and white gay men, and hispanic bisexual women...etc. You make it sound as if black men are the sole source of the problem. What about the female prostitutes (black and white) who spread HIV every day to others? What about promiscuous black women who spread it to black men? You seem to be doing the same thing that has left the spread of HIV unchecked in this country throughout the 80's and early 90's... looking for the group to blame, and ignoring the fact that education and proper use of protection is the only way we will decrease the number of people living with the dreaded affliction, and thereby limit it's spread. \"Abhorrent\" sexual behavior is something that despite your best intentions, will not go away. Condoms and education are the best solutions to this problem.",
