   "What does it mean to believe something? I believe that today is Sunday, October 1, 2006, that democracy is a good idea and that my cat is gray and white. If you had reason to question the validity of any of those claims, you might ask me why I believed the way I did. I could show you a calendar, state my reasons supporting democracy and show you my cat. If my support of those reasons were good enough, you would likely believe as I do. \n \n If you gave me a cogent argument against democracy, I may change my mind or conclude that we disagree on that topic. We could say that we respect each other's beliefs, because we each have advanced a reasonable argument in support of our beliefs.\n \n If, however, you said today is Tuesday, December 20, 1845 or that my cat is plaid, I rightly could not respect those beliefs. If you supported your statement by telling me you read it in some very old and venerated book, that would do nothing to alter my feelings about your beliefs. Assuming we are speaking the same language, it is quite clear that my cat is not plaid and it simply cannot possibly be 1845.\n \n No where in human discourse do we expect anyone to respect beliefs simply because one holds them. There are either good reasons to hold a belief or there are not. If there are valid facts for a belief, others will not only respect that belief, but they will likely and immediately believe the same. If one has beliefs that are not supported by facts, one would quite reasonably defer in sharing those beliefs and correctly would not respect them.\n \n If I do not respect some senseless belief, I have done that holder of those beliefs no harm. I have not offended him. I am not \"prejudiced against\" him. Even if he believes very strongly, gets great comfort and places much importance in those beliefs, that should not alter my position that I have no respect for preposterous beliefs. It also is irrelevant that a great number of others believe similarly. That's simply how reasonable thinking adults behave if we are to have any intellectual integrity.\n \n It is hopefully obvious where this is leading. Religious beliefs are the only province of human dialogue in which we are expected to respect beliefs that are nonsensical, violent or stubbornly intolerant to any opposing beliefs. It is worse than that. If we speak up about not respecting ideas that are simply not worthy of any respect, we are felt to be committing offensive and outrageous behavior. It is simply taboo to state the obvious, that many religious beliefs are simply untenable, and it is lunacy to encourage belief in ideas that are based on the texts of primitive peoples of centuries ago. \n \n If one speaks up, one is branded as impolite at best, or as a heretic at worst. Isn't it time for us to start speaking up anyway? Isn't it time we no longer allow these archaic and sometimes antisocial beliefs to continually go unchallenged. It is simply not reasonable for an adult to support a belief by saying some book said so - that it tantamount to the childhood response of \"because!\" It clearly is time to address spirituality in a more mature and thoughtful way than adhering to outmoded and potentially dangerous dogmas of antiquity.",

You are free to say anything you want about religion, and in fact do it here. People criticize religion all the time.\n \n Are you saying you think religious people should give in and be convinced that they shouldn't be religious? If that's what you are really getting at, then you truly are going to waste a lot of time doing so. (A.) You said yourself people are spiritual beings and so people are going to be a part of things pertaining to faith.

   "No, these behaviors were caused directly from religious belief. These were due to following the holy scripture literally. This is not an example of using religious as an excuse to commit a crime. The Inquisition was about the suppression of heresy. The jihadists feel, because of their faith, the infidels should die. Just because some choose to ignore the more barbarous words of the scripture doesn't make them go away. \n\n \n No, they were not. They were caused by political leaders wanting to exert power over people, wanting lands, and greed. What I think you are doing is confusing the religious beliefs for the reaction that took place. Religion may have indeed led people to believe some views were not correct (\"heresy\"), but it was something else that caused them to choose to kill the heretics, burn them, torture them, etc. Find me a verse that says specifically to stretch a man on a rack for heresy, and you might have a point. But you won't find any such verse. It's not the belief that some had erroneous religious views that was the problem. It was the frenzied tendency to kill and torture people for that, and if you think it was religion that caused that then you are wrong, pure and simple. \n \n Now I'm not saying there aren't cases in religion that are bad. Christians did do bad things. 9/11 did happen. What disturbs me though is that you are extrapolating that to and condemning ALL of religion for it.

I am not trying to be deliberately offensive. However, how can you rationally defend your beliefs? How can you give a logical argument for the existence of God, a deity whose characteristics you know in great detail, with dead-on certainty? How can a rational mind defend walking on water, virgin births and the creation story? If you think there is a logical reason to support these unshakable beliefs, I'm listening. This mysticism is beyond what thinking adults can accept. I do not think that walling off \"faith\" as another category of your psyche, in which reason is abandoned, makes any sense. It sounds simply like an excuse.\n \n It may sound insulting to compare God to Santa Claus, but, I am not trying to be inflammatory. (In reality, that is only because we drop our BS-meter when we start thinking about God). What if I never stopped believing in Santa Claus? What if I believed, truly believed as much I believe I exist, that Santa traveled around the world on his sleigh pulled by flying reindeer. I have seen Him at work; there are presents around the tree in the morning. If the tree happens to be bare xmas morning, Santa has his reasons - he is mysterious and it is beyond mere humans to understand his ways. \n \n Now I really, really believe in this nonsense. What harm am I causing if it makes me happy to believe in the jolly old elf? His message is one of joy and happiness to all the good little boys and girls of the world. Would you want me to be your bank president, your doctor, you children's teacher or President of the US? Most assuredly not. You should rightly be concerned that my irrationality might extend to other spheres. This is my concern for religion. \n \n A vast majority of US citizens believe in creation. A great many believe that science, as it contradicts that tale, is a malevolent force. No one sees the inconsistency of only having a problem with a tiny fraction of science, like evolutionary biology. But many truly believe scientists are bad and teaching what we have learned through science will harm our children. We are willfully encouraging ignorance and that is a direct cause of religion's ability to have otherwise rational people suspend reason.\n \n I cannot respect blind allegiance to irrationality of any kind. To the extent that many religions encourage that, those ideas (not the people) do not deserve the respect of a thinking adult.",

Religion is hardly ever the real motivation for violence and conflict: it just provides the alibi. (And the beauty of it is, it can do that just as well even when its supernatural premises are transparently false.)\n\n \n Gotta disagree with you, John. I think that religion is precisely the real motivation for that violence and conflict. I don't think the witch burners actively considered the consequences of those intelligent, possibly outspoken single women as a source of nascent feminism and its threat to the patriarchal culture. They charcoaled those gals because they acted different (contrary to god's plan) or the crops were bad (caused by god's displeasure) and somebody had to be accountable, or for any number of arbitrary reasons. These women were heretics and their destruction was a kindness to them and the community. It made perfect sense to do this. This was considered to be sensible and devout behavior. One can, of course, never know, but I don't think witch cookers thought that religion was bull$$hit and deviously plotted to use that as an excuse. They were doing the lord's work. \n \n The jihadists of 9/11 weren't willing to kill themselves and hundreds of innocents because they had sober concerns of US imperialist behavior and the geopolitical consequence to the Middle East. Nor did they primarily hope that by committing these acts of terrorism, they thought that political opinion would be swayed and they were willing to make the ultimate sacrifice, knowing their existence may be extinguished. They did this to please god and they and their families would be highly rewarded for this action in the afterlife. God justly feels the western infidel should die. These were religious actions and millions of people support them. Families feel honor and joy instead of grief that their golden child is chosen to immolate himself in a crowded marketplace. \n \n You have to believe in god and an afterlife to pull off actions such as these. When you believe these things, heresy is the worst possible crime. If my words or actions may influence your child such that he might call god by a different name or not believe in him at all, I have harmed your loved one for all eternity. In comparison, child molestation is a misdemeanor. \n \n The consequences of religious convictions are not of minor. 22% of the US is completely certain that Jesus will descend from heaven to gather up the good kids in the next 50 years. Another 22% feels this will probably happen. The US president likely is in one of these categories. Having this certainty cannot help but influence one's opinion on earthly matters, such as war and preserving the earth.",

   "What does it mean to believe something? I believe that today is Sunday, October 1, 2006, that democracy is a good idea and that my cat is gray and white. If you had reason to question the validity of any of those claims, you might ask me why I believed the way I did. I could show you a calendar, state my reasons supporting democracy and show you my cat. If my support of those reasons were good enough, you would likely believe as I do. \n \n If you gave me a cogent argument against democracy, I may change my mind or conclude that we disagree on that topic. We could say that we respect each other's beliefs, because we each have advanced a reasonable argument in support of our beliefs.\n \n If, however, you said today is Tuesday, December 20, 1845 or that my cat is plaid, I rightly could not respect those beliefs. If you supported your statement by telling me you read it in some very old and venerated book, that would do nothing to alter my feelings about your beliefs. Assuming we are speaking the same language, it is quite clear that my cat is not plaid and it simply cannot possibly be 1845.\n \n No where in human discourse do we expect anyone to respect beliefs simply because one holds them. There are either good reasons to hold a belief or there are not. If there are valid facts for a belief, others will not only respect that belief, but they will likely and immediately believe the same. If one has beliefs that are not supported by facts, one would quite reasonably defer in sharing those beliefs and correctly would not respect them.\n \n If I do not respect some senseless belief, I have done that holder of those beliefs no harm. I have not offended him. I am not \"prejudiced against\" him. Even if he believes very strongly, gets great comfort and places much importance in those beliefs, that should not alter my position that I have no respect for preposterous beliefs. It also is irrelevant that a great number of others believe similarly. That's simply how reasonable thinking adults behave if we are to have any intellectual integrity.\n \n It is hopefully obvious where this is leading. Religious beliefs are the only province of human dialogue in which we are expected to respect beliefs that are nonsensical, violent or stubbornly intolerant to any opposing beliefs. It is worse than that. If we speak up about not respecting ideas that are simply not worthy of any respect, we are felt to be committing offensive and outrageous behavior. It is simply taboo to state the obvious, that many religious beliefs are simply untenable, and it is lunacy to encourage belief in ideas that are based on the texts of primitive peoples of centuries ago. \n \n If one speaks up, one is branded as impolite at best, or as a heretic at worst. Isn't it time for us to start speaking up anyway? Isn't it time we no longer allow these archaic and sometimes antisocial beliefs to continually go unchallenged. It is simply not reasonable for an adult to support a belief by saying some book said so - that it tantamount to the childhood response of \"because!\" It clearly is time to address spirituality in a more mature and thoughtful way than adhering to outmoded and potentially dangerous dogmas of antiquity.\n\n \n Thel: You have generated an interesting topic. May I pick at a specific item of assumption? The bolded section above uses the phrase \"Simply not worthy of respect\". \n \n 2 questions come to mind on this:\n \n 1) How is what is worthy of respect defined?\n 2) Why do you get to decide that? In other words, don't just define it but give good reason WHY your decision as to what is worthy and what is not worthy is the best decision. \n \n EF",

Evolution. The list, inasmuch as it lengthens by the day, is truly endless.\n \n In particular, anything deserving of the name 'theory' has survived precisely the kind of rigorous inquisition you describe. The salient point to take away from this discussion is that religion survives in a different way, by denying the validity of rational enquiry, inspiring utterly disproportionate and intimidating umbrage in its followers toward anyone who voices a doubt, and by infecting its victims before their ability to reason and criticize is fully developed. Religion goes out of its way to avoid the kind of skeptical, critical, intelligent analysis that scientific theories endure because that is precisely what it cannot survive.\n \n Steeeve, I think you're overreaching yourself a little.

What makes my belief superior to theirs?\n\n \n I can't speak for you personally, as to how you arrived at your atheism, but to arrive at atheism (or statistical agnosticism) via evidence and logical conjecture is quite different to swallowing whole whatever comes out of a book, however old that book might be (especially for old books, if anything) and however impressive the ritual and veneration with which it is surrounded.\n \n Take your attitude to its logical conclusion: if no 'belief' is superior to any other, why should we not teach absolutely any nonsense imaginable in our schools?

   "Note: this contains an amendment to my previous post.\n \n \nfine, you have FAITH that the model represents the reality. You are still dealing with an issue of faith.\n\n \n \nBut you still have a belief that those axioms represent the reality and are not flawed in and of themselves.\n\n \n For a moment I thought you had correctly identified the logical chink in my argument*, but your second statement demonstrates that you have not.\n \n A model of reality either reliably produces results that correlate with what our senses perceive**, or it does not. It either reliably predicts the results of future observations**, or it does not. If it does both of these things, it is a useful model, and utility is not a matter of faith: it can be demonstrated on demand; it works whether you believe it or not.\n \n At some future point we may make observations that contradict or diverge from the predictions made by that model, or decide that its margin of error and parametric limits are unacceptable, at which point scientists (crucially unlike priests in the same position; see below) get very excited and start looking for ways to improve matters. The progression from Newtonian to Einsteinian mechanics illustrates this point perfectly: one has superceded the other in its ability to accurately model observed phenomena, but that does not detract from the Newtonian model's achievement: it continues to make useful predictions for systems operating at sub-relatavistic speeds. Newton's model did not become 'wrong' when Einstein came along, any more than it was 'right' beforehand: it is merely useful.\n \n The point that really exposes the woolly thinking at the core of your argument is your claim that axioms might be, as you put it, 'flawed in and of themselves'. Axioms are by definition what we start with; there is no frame of reference against which to judge them flawed because they are the frame. The mathematics which emerge within the space they define may not be useful for modelling reality, but that doesn't make them intrinsically wrong - just inappropriate for that purpose. I can define a space that includes the axiom 'bananas are red'; it's not a useful space but that doesn't make the axiom flawed 'in and of itself'. In my space, bananas are red. Anything in that space that was not red would simply not be a banana, however yellow and tasty it might appear to you as an outside observer.\n \n * So, how exactly does observing whether or not axioms accurately model reality relate to faith? Here's the chink you should have been aiming for: we believe (since the nature of our intellect, as we perceive it, gives us little choice) that our senses and reason are connected in a logical fashion. I believe that I can observe, make deductions, and apply those deductions to my 'reality' in a way that will in turn feed back to my senses in a consistent way. On a crude level, one might say I believe that if I drop an object, it will fall - but more fundamentally, I believe that if it doesn't fall, it will nevertheless be possible to isolate a principle upon which I could (in theory if not in practice) cause a more or less accurate repeat of the event. \n \n To this extent, religion is fundamentally identical, except now the principles of repeatability and rationality are embodied in a mythical being: do what he wants and you will be rewarded; do as he forbids and you will be punished. No religion worships a god whose blessings are entirely capricious; what would be the point, if worship cannot influence him? The tacit acceptance of that logic within religion demonstrates that we are all making certain, fundamental assumptions.\n \n Nevertheless, even given that science and religion share this same ultimate foundation, it is meaningless to declare them equally valid via an analysis deliberately restricted to the ground they have in common. Two cars might both have four wheels, but that doesn't prove they're equally fast.\n \n Here I return to my previous post. I wasn't entirely happy with it, though I could not immediately understand why. This is why: although I stand by my assertion that not all beliefs are equal, no beliefs deserve respect. I don't 'respect' someone's belief in evolution any more than I 'respect' someone's belief in creationism. I agree or I don't. If I happened to disagree with evolution, I would not shy away from going toe-to-toe in a debate out of 'respect' for someone's opinion, any more than I shy away now from debating religion.\n \n What is deserving of respect is the willingness to test ones beliefs against the anvil of reality; to defer to the universe as the ultimate arbiter of merit, and the fact I accord that willingness respect is what makes me a scientist.\n \n ** usually with a well-defined degree of error and within well-defined soft or hard parametric limits.",

That's the problem I have with your thinking and I've told you that several times now. You began this thread talking about how you want to be able to show disrespect toward religion, and to disapprove. You've changed gears here and are now trying to discuss whether religion is rational or not, which is not your original argument. Your original argument was along the lines of 'people should be able to not respect religion' and/or that you feel religion is above criticism in some peoples' minds. Whether or not religion is rational or not is a topic of endless debate that has been going on for centuries--certainly not something that will be solved here today. What IS apparent though is that you've thrown logic and rationalism to the wind by (a.) engaging in a very bad generalization, and (b.) seek to concern yourself in the affairs of others when it's not your business. Do you want to discuss your original topic or are you done with that? Because it seems you are done with it. I'd say religion IS above criticism in a sense because it's a personal matter to people. It's like criticizing them for liking chocolate--it would be more rational to prefer green vegetables because vegetables are better for them. But they happen to like chocolate too. It may not be \"rational\", but it doesn't really matter that much. It's what they want to do, and there's no reason to criticize them for it. Same with religion.\n \n Regarding (b.), I am reminded of the way gay rights activists use the argument that it should be no concern of others what goes on in the bedroom of other people. This is a good point, but it also applies to religion. It should be no concern of yours that your neighbor prays, or that he goes to church, or that he reads his Bible, for instance. It's HIS business, and if it makes him happy, that's what matters. You say you \"need to evaluate before accepting\" his creed, but you don't have to accept it at all! No one here is saying that you do. It doesn't matter; what matters is that it's his business that HE does, and who are you to judge him for that?",

By considering the rationality of beliefs, he is attempting to establish criteria for judging how worthy they are of respect. As I said above, I prefer to make a clearer distinction: no belief is intrinsically worthy of respect, only the willingness of its holder to expose it to analysis and reject or refine it accordingly. The beliefs held by such a person may then inherit a certain cache, in that they are likely to have survived - on merit, rather than through wilful close-mindedness - significant opposition.\n \n \nWhat IS apparent though is that you've thrown logic and rationalism to the wind by (a.) engaging in a very bad generalization, \n\n \n Bad simply because it's a generalisation, or because there's something actually incorrect about it? It's certainly unpleasant to be told - if you happen to be peacefully religious yourself - that you are harbouring in your mind, like a symptom-free hepatitis carrier, a construct that can be lethal if transmitted unthinkingly to a person without the necessary immune response. But that alone doesn't make the claim wrong.\n \n \nI'd say religion IS above criticism in a sense because it's a personal matter to people. It's like criticizing them for liking chocolate--it would be more rational to prefer green vegetables because vegetables are better for them. But they happen to like chocolate too. It may not be \"rational\", but it doesn't really matter that much. It's what they want to do, and there's no reason to criticize them for it. Same with religion.\n\n \n Wrong on a number of levels. Let's pick a more appropriate analogy than a namby-pamby bar of chocolate: what I'm doing is much more like criticizing someone for liking cigarettes, and even more like criticising tobacco companies for continuing to market their products, denying their well-established harmful side effects in some consumers, and deliberately targetting children because they are more vulnerable and less capable of rationally deciding 'no'. Hey, this is a really good analogy!\n \n Cutting even closer to the bone, let's imagine a smoker who, believing that he has made his own 'personal choice' (despite the fact his whole family smokes and the millions spent on marketing) flatly refuses to believe the evidence piling up against him (because he doesn't want to feel stupid), and indeed actively encourages others to take up the habit (so as to have company in his delusion). What a perfectly harmless personal matter! Now let's imagine him campaigning for the right to smoke wherever he likes, regardless of the risk to other peoples' health, and the unpleasant odours they have to endure. Let's imagine him campaigning for the right to teach smoking as an 'alternative theory' to non-smoking in school.\n \n Now imagine a country of smokers who make it a law that anyone who stops smoking should be put to death, as should anyone who preaches the virtues of giving up. Imagine a country falling as we speak into the grip of neo-smokers, who fill their citizens' TV screens with propaganda denouncing non-smokers as 'unpatriotic', and intent on making their personal choice their country's official method of inhalation.\n \n You would have a point, if religions truly were as blameless as a chocolate bar. But religion is not a personal matter. It is a selfish meme with a blind drive to spread and infect, and as an evolutionist it is no surprise whatsoever to observe that the most successful such memes in the long term (the 'big three') are the ones that possess retractable claws and hidden barbs, in the form of latent messages of violence, intolerance and conquest waiting to be expressed as action by the 'right' believers. Now, we can choose to be ridden like beasts, welcoming the reins because they free us from the frightening responsibility of finding our own way, or we can cast them aside and face the universe on our feet, unburdened.\n \n Less poetically, I could instead say this: if, as you say, people should be free to practice their own religion, and those religions happen to involve preaching to others and criticising them for their lack of faith, then how can you deny me the right to demonstrate the virtues of atheism, poke holes in the nonsense spouted by believers, and criticise others for their superstitions? Again we see religion's undeserved double-standard at work: it's OK to preach (which entails trying to change the way another person behaves through words), but not ok to try to convince preachers they're wrong or that they should cease preaching (which, you'll note, also entails trying to change the way another person behaves through words). When you get right down to it, you like the former but not the latter because you're personally convinced the former is helping while the latter is interfering.",

Now let's imagine him campaigning for the right to smoke wherever he likes, regardless of the risk to other peoples' health, and the unpleasant odours they have to endure. Let's imagine him campaigning for the right to teach smoking as an 'alternative theory' to non-smoking in school.\n\n \n Fine, chocolate OR smoking, it's peoples' business what they do. You've picked a non-effective analogy because I happen to think smoking laws are violation of rights. If people want to light up, eat chocolate, or pray and read their Bible, that's their business.\n \n \nNow imagine a country of smokers who make it a law that anyone who stops smoking should be put to death, as should anyone who preaches the virtues of giving up.\n\n \n Then they should be opposed, but their wanting to change laws isn't the fault of their smoking, it's because they want to oppress others. And again, you'r beef should be with those specific people who want to oppress, not to punish or judge ALL smokers everywhere because of the actions of a few. That's an irrational approach--surely you agree.\n \n \nYou would have a point, if religions truly were as blameless as a chocolate bar. But religion is not a personal matter. It is a selfish meme with a blind drive to spread and infect\n\n \n Again, it depends on the religion. Buddhism doesn't seek any of those things. Moderate Christianity that isn't out to change laws or prostlytize isn't either. It's just silly to paint all of religion with the color of it's worst factions. I don't how that could possibly be unclear to you.\n \n \nLess poetically, I could instead say this: if, as you say, people should be free to practice their own religion, and those religions happen to involve preaching to others and criticising them for their lack of faith\n\n \n Ah, but now you've added a condition to your sweeping judgement of religion. Now the condition is those who \"happen to involve preaching to others and criticising them for their lack of faith\". So now, it isn't religion in general, just critical preachy religion? Which is it? And if it's still religion in general, you had no business using the conditional statement.\n \n \n, then how can you deny me the right to demonstrate the virtues of atheism, poke holes in the nonsense spouted by believers, and criticise others for their superstitions?\n\n \n No one is trying to deny you the right to anything. You are free to criticize as much as you want. I just think you should be fair, that's all. And by gross generalization as I've pointed out, you've been anything but fair.",

   "\n Here I return to my previous post. I wasn't entirely happy with it, though I could not immediately understand why. This is why: although I stand by my assertion that not all beliefs are equal, no beliefs deserve respect. I don't 'respect' someone's belief in evolution any more than I 'respect' someone's belief in creationism. I agree or I don't. If I happened to disagree with evolution, I would not shy away from going toe-to-toe in a debate out of 'respect' for someone's opinion, any more than I shy away now from debating religion.\n \n\n \n \n Thank you for being more articulate than me on this point. (Actually you are refreshingly more articulate than me on most points.)\n \n The concept of \"respecting a belief\" is not even entertained in usual conversation. Respect is not something that figures into it. If a belief is supported with ample evidence, I will agree with it. \n \n It is only with religion that we are expected to \"respect\" one's belief, even if they are ludicrous. The value of a belief is how well it represents reality. Its value is not derived from how fervently one believes it, how much comfort one gains from or how much awe one feels it deserves without regard to the evidence that may or may not support it.",

   "No, the crux of the problem is that you are generalizing by assuming the problems and violent actions of a few religious people down through history applies to religion as a whole. That's the problem I have with your thinking and I've told you that several times now. You began this thread talking about how you want to be able to show disrespect toward religion, and to disapprove. You've changed gears here and are now trying to discuss whether religion is rational or not, which is not your original argument. Your original argument was along the lines of 'people should be able to not respect religion' and/or that you feel religion is above criticism in some peoples' minds. Whether or not religion is rational or not is a topic of endless debate that has been going on for centuries--certainly not something that will be solved here today. What IS apparent though is that you've thrown logic and rationalism to the wind by (a.) engaging in a very bad generalization, and (b.) seek to concern yourself in the affairs of others when it's not your business. Do you want to discuss your original topic or are you done with that? Because it seems you are done with it. I'd say religion IS above criticism in a sense because it's a personal matter to people. It's like criticizing them for liking chocolate--it would be more rational to prefer green vegetables because vegetables are better for them. But they happen to like chocolate too. It may not be \"rational\", but it doesn't really matter that much. It's what they want to do, and there's no reason to criticize them for it. Same with religion.\n \n Regarding (b.), I am reminded of the way gay rights activists use the argument that it should be no concern of others what goes on in the bedroom of other people. This is a good point, but it also applies to religion. It should be no concern of yours that your neighbor prays, or that he goes to church, or that he reads his Bible, for instance. It's HIS business, and if it makes him happy, that's what matters. You say you \"need to evaluate before accepting\" his creed, but you don't have to accept it at all! No one here is saying that you do. It doesn't matter; what matters is that it's his business that HE does, and who are you to judge him for that?\n\n \n Why I think it is my business if someone believes in God and the Bible: \n (This contains some repeat material from previous posts, because some people don't listen.)\n \n 1. Creationism. In the US 85% of us believe in the creation of the universe as described in the Bible. 44% want it taught in the schools, 22% want it taught exclusively with the current scientific texts expurgated of evolution, big bang, etc. This is encouraging willful ignorance. There are many who believe that science is a bad thing and that it is \"anti-religion.\" Certainly science effectively refutes much of the Bible, buts its intention is never anti-religion. Its intentions are \"pro-knowledge.\" Religious belief directly causes this antagonism toward science. \n 2. The rapture. In the US, 22% are certain that the world will end and Jesus is coming in the next 50 years (I assume because prophecies are apparently being fulfilled.) Another 22% feel this probably will happen. For some, a view of the mushroom cloud will bring elation and relief, not terror. Having this \"short-timers syndrome\" must certainly affect one's world view. This could be particularly troublesome if one is in a position of power. It has been suggested that George Bush has regularly consulted with persons of this persuasion. This has a direct on policy toward the protection of the earth.\n 3. Contraception and sex education. Our policy on these topics many times is not based on public health medicine, but on Christian \"morality,\" i.e., that sex prior to marriage is sinful. One third of school sex education programs teach abstinence only. A third of all aid to other nations is based on this restriction as well. We base the policy on prevention of sin, rather than the prevention of disease and pregnancy. Death, disease and unwanted children are the direct cause of religion. Prevention of sin is most important because it is in the best interest of our immortal soul.\n 4. Gay rights. Gays are not permitted to marry, adopt children, serve in the military or be afforded protection against discrimination in the workplace, housing and accommodations. These restrictions are based on the biblical declaration of homosexuality as sinful. This policy only causes suffering and provides no benefit to anyone except the sensibilities of the religious.\n 5. Stem cell research. Because of the Christian concept of an immortal soul taking up residence in a zygote, a blastula of undifferentiated cells is afforded priority over children with diabetes, adults crippled with Parkinson's or victim's of spinal cord injury. Because of religion, morality is based on some arbitrary rule, rather than the consequences of actions or the alleviation of suffering. \n 6. George Bush and the US government. Dubya thinks God wanted him to be president and he had openly espoused \"god's law\" as basis for his actions, the appointment of Supreme Court justices. Because of religion, this mockery is deemed OK and is highly encouraged.\n 7. Israel. There are many religious conflicts occurring throughout the world, but the \"Middle East Problem\" trumps them all and could easily spell the end of us all. This was started because some book says that the Jews have a right to some land, bestowed by God, the universal land broker. \n 8. The war on drugs. A miserable failure because we base our laws, not on the reduction of harm due to addiction and drug-based crime, but the prevention of sinful behavior.\n \n Enough?",

   "Was it to me? I haven't had time to give it a good review, honestly. I will soon, but if it's a case-study of events (like the inquisition or crusades) that doesn't prove anything about religion in general.\n\n \n I don't think it was to you (sorry; it wasn't my intention to give that impression, though reading back I can see I did) It isn't a case study. I think there's a link to it somewhere in this thread, if you're interested.\n \n \nIf you are going to condemn Christianity for the words in the Bible, it seems to me it would be more reasonable to base your judgements on the way most modern Christians deal with those passages rather than what the passages say.\n \n your beef seems to be with fundamentalists. And rightly so. But most Christians would never do the things you're talking about. So the religion as they live it out is not the problem.\n \n Not all Christians are like EZ. I dare say most aren't.\n \n Because it's bad logic. Generalizations aren't good in cases like this. You should know better than to think that because one Christian acts a certain way that they all will. The very fact that most don't should be clear.\n\n \n I apologise for not making the nature of my 'generalisation' more clear. It is very different from what you are taking it to be, and most certainly does not involve claiming that all christians behave or are likely to behave the same way. Allow me to try to explain:\n \n You see 'your' religion as something seperate from what you describe as fundamentalism. You base this distinction upon your different interpretation of the bible, and the different behaviour this interpretation inspires. Am I right so far?\n \n My 'generalisation' is not, as you rightly fear, to lump all those who read the bible (or any other holy book) together and brand them as dangerous. Rather it is to consider that what you see, from your point of view, as almost seperate faiths looks very different if one shifts to a religion-eye-view; if one analyses religions from the perspective of them being, in a sense, organisms in their own right. If this sounds a little kooky, bear with me :)\n \n Imagine an organism with a holy book as its DNA/RNA code. Its cells are people - or at least the part of people that isn't otherwise occupied with getting up, going to work and watching TV. Just as different cells within a conventional organism employ different parts of the DNA code according to where they find themselves in the organism, in order to perform different tasks, so 'people cells' interpret scripture differently according to their environment; their personal experiences and morality.\n \n Crucially, however, these very different cells all retain and pass on the same DNA code when they reproduce or assimilate new cells into the organism. And just as conventional DNA is not in any sense 'aware' of what any of the cells it creates do, much less the organism as a whole, religion-DNA is still what defines the organism, and is therefore what is 'selected' in the competitive environment that religions inhabit. And that 'environment' includes the morality its cells have evolved for themselves, the society in which they live, the stimuli to which they are exposed, their intelligence, and so forth.\n \n I'm sure this all sounds a little far-fetched, but remember that I'm not asking you to accept any of this as 'real'; I'm just constructing a useful model for understanding the behaviour and evolution of religions, rather than focusing on the minutae of their individual followers.\n \n In any case, let's bring ourselves back down to earth with a few examples we can relate to.\n \n Imagine a religion which - to pick a pertinent 'gene' - commanded 'thou shalt not kill other cells', and nothing else. Quite a pleasant religion, from the point of view of its cells, but a pretty toothless and vulnerable specimen in Religionland, especially Religionland thousands of years ago when killing other cells and taking their stuff was a popular global pastime. Cells adhering to the One Commandment don't last very long unless they happen to live somewhere very isolated or very easy-going, where they either can't make the mistake of telling other cells about their faith, or anyone they do tell is likely not to think \"Great; these guys won't fight back if we take their stuff!\"\n \n Assuming that such a religion does pop up somewhere competitive, in 'our' reality a bunch of really nice people get slaughtered. In Religionland, a creature of a different kind dies. I'm sure by now you can extrapolate where all this is leading, but I'll take the steps anyway.\n \n The example above shows one way in which religions with scripture-genes that are too incompatible with the cells' environment tend to fail. Another is for a religion to be too unrelentingly nasty: not many cells go for that kind of thing and other cells tend to kill them and take their stuff if they do.\n \n Religion can pick up random mutations, but what it really has going for it, which sluggardly genetics does not, is the intelligence of the cells it inhabits and their ingenuity in fulfilling the religion's command to spread me. Its cells can work out how to make the religion survive better, and modify it accordingly. A few teeth here - oops, no, that's a bit too nasty; here, let's put in some more passages about being be nice to one another... yeah; that works: now we look all peaceful and inviting and friendly most of the time, but we can still whip out the fire and brimstone if we need to.\n \n It's a tremendously protracted and convoluted process, but what we see now, today, are formidable and subtle beasts indeed. They can accommodate a gamut of cells whose interpretation of the DNA - if you remove the cells representing shadings of agreement in between - can be strikingly different, even contradictory. Yet they all act, in their different ways, to preserve and extend the organism. You might do it by being pleasant and agreeable and making christianity an attractive prospect to gentle people, and expose only the mildest of defenses (\"criticism of beliefs is rude\"). Others might do it by reacting with glee at the prospect of dropping some more bombs on people, and making the idea of criticising your religion seem risky.\n \n Sorry - really have to break off now and go to bed. Will pick up in the morning.",

   "I agree. Of course I believe mine is superior. But so what? I'm not so arrogant to assume that I couldn't possibly be wrong.\n\n \n And that is precisely why you (and by extension your beliefs) are deserving of greater respect!\n \n Because you think like that, you will always be challenging your beliefs based on their merit. \"Does this make sense?

Now, we might debate the intended meaning of 'adversity' in that context, but what helps keeps religions alive is the human prediliction to interpret 'adversity' as 'someone pointing out logical flaws'.",

   "Ok; awake and refreshed!\n \n There are a few more points I still need to make. The first is to reiterate that your moderate interpretation of christianity does not go so far as to remake the bible fully in its own image, and to further observe that there are beliefs integral to even your interpretation to guard against such changes. I think I'm right in saying that certain editions of the bible tweak things here and there, but these are analogous to alleles, rather than wholesale modifications.\n \n The second point, a corollary of the first, is that even within your moderate sect of christianity the bible, and hence the genes that code for fundamentalism, remain intact, requiring only the right environment to be expressed.\n \n Why should this be? Why preserve unchanged a book whose literal teachings are far from congruent with your actual beliefs? There are a few common rationalisations, some of them evident in this and other threads. It's a test; it's human frailty; it's not religion's 'fault'; it's this, that or the other. What all these rationalisations ignore, looming like an elephant in a living room, is that no other kinds of text are allowed to hide behind these excuses. If a system of instruction performs badly, or has unwanted side-effects, it gets modified. If the principles expressed in a science book, or a management handbook, or a legal document are found wanting, they are altered, because the teachings are held responsible for how they influence people.\n \n The third point is to observe that the changes in society that have tended to repress fundamentalist genes have been secular in nature. Larger populations, easier communication, secular education, a general reduction in poverty and its attendant fears and anxieties - these are changes to Religionland, not religion itself. But as is evident from recent developments in America, those genes are alive and well, and are ready to rise to prominence given a chance.\n \n We arrive, then, at the first stage of my 'generalisation' about religion: so long as moderate sects within a religion treat their holy books as inviolate and vary only their interpretation of it, they are wrong to claim that their religion is seperate from fundamentalism. They are part of the same entity, serving different functions in different circumstances, the end result of which is the perpetuation of the religion itself. \n \n Even if one were to somehow temporarily eradicate harmful interpretations of the koran or the bible or the torah, so long as moderates retain a faith-based rather than scientific attitude towards the proliferation and stasis of their holy books*, those genes need only encounter the right environment to re-express themselves, and for violence and atrocity in the defence of religion to resume - violence and atrocity which would not occur in the absence of those religious genes, and which is not ultimately in the interests of human beings. \n \n The second stage of my 'generalisation' about religion concerns whether or not there exists a desirable stable state of religion, and whether we can reach such a state from here.\n \n Perhaps if we all were of one faith, and we were all fairly content and managed to avoid injustice towards one another, such a situation could arise. But none of the 'big three' faiths are candidates for that, and certainly not any combination of those faiths. Individually they fail because they are inherently static and imperfect. Static by design, imperfect thanks to the understandable myopia of their progenitors. Witness EZ's intolerance of homosexuality: homosexuality isn't what we used to think it was, it isn't about to go anywhere, and unless material changes are made to the bible, the religious genes that vindicate EZ's intolerance - now, thanks to his faith, firmly and irrevocably installed in his rational demilitarized zone - aren't going anywhere either. Fundamentalist genes will always find an outlet, and when they do they multiply furiously and by any means necessary, however unscrupulous, because they are the most virulently self-righteous.\n \n The third stage of my 'generalisation' about religion is whether it offers us any benefits that make it worth putting up with. Available evidence is not encouraging. Our innate morality encourages us to behave considerately towards people we perceive as being in 'our' group, and religions add very little of demonstrable value to that morality. Joining a religion might nevertheless seem to be a good thing for an individual, as it instantly expands ones in-group, but it invariably also expands and solidifies his out-group even more, because that is what best serves the interests of the religious organism. As a christian, you know before you even meet a jew or a muslim that he is 'different'. That difference doesn't always trigger a religious immune response and result in harmful behaviour, but it's a different story when fundamentalism inevitably erupts. Those latent perceived differences, preserved through times of peaceful coexistence in the pages of holy books rather than being allowed to fade fully away, spring up like barricades.\n \n Observe America's reaction to terrorist attacks on its citizens: fundamentalist genes exploded into communities that perceived themselves to be threatened. Agents of those genes - politicians in particular - sensed opportunity in the changing environment and exploited it like mad - because after all, they're right, and the ends justify the means (as is often the mentality of those afflicted by fundamentalism). Here's a chance to take a swing at competing ideologies, and this pesky 'science' that laps like acid at their religion's borders. So they attack ideological enemies abroad with bombs, and those at home (whom are inconveniently within the 'in-group' of the electorate) with propaganda and misinformation. Spread the fear and you spread the environment conducive to fundamentalism, and given a critical mass of fundamentalism you can go for the really big prize: aggressive conquest of territory.\n \n Such events are inevitable if Religionland is at all populous. There will always be at least a few fundamentalists who refuse to get along with other faiths, and so they'll prod and poke, pushing each others' buttons and raising tensions so they can have a really good scrap. And none of it is in the interests of human beings, only the survival of a blind and mindless idea evolved from something someone made up thousands of years ago. What a miserable waste of life and resources.\n \n * What do I mean by this? I mean the advocation of religion as if it were a panacea, without consideration for the kind of ground you are seeding. I mean the obstinate retention of ambiguous and even misleading passages which must be endlessly and repeatedly reinterpreted as metaphor to avoid harmful misunderstandings, on the spurious grounds that it is more important to preserve the literal text of the book than it is to optimise the correct communication of its message.",

   "Assuming that such a religion does pop up somewhere competitive, in 'our' reality a bunch of really nice people get slaughtered. In Religionland, a creature of a different kind dies. I'm sure by now you can extrapolate where all this is leading, but I'll take the steps anyway.\n\n \n The 800 lb gorrila problem with you survival-of-the-fittest view of religion is that the fittest has NOT survived; religion, overall, is a lot less violent than it was 1000 to a few hundred years ago. Other than a few cases of Islamic fundamentalism, there's been no inquisitions, no church sponsored crusades, or witch burnings for a very, very long time. (which is another reason I believe these were a product of the environment more so than the religion.)\n \n I also think your cells and organism analogy doesn't fit well, mainly because religion just isn't that well organised. In fact, it's not really organised at all. There's no central organism the cells are a part of; they are all individual factions and groups. It's just that ther term \"religion\" is used to describe all these groups; it doesn't mean they are unified whatsoever to any degree. \n \n \nThere are a few more points I still need to make. The first is to reiterate that your moderate interpretation of christianity does not go so far as to remake the bible fully in its own image, and to further observe that there are beliefs integral to even your interpretation to guard against such changes. I think I'm right in saying that certain editions of the bible tweak things here and there, but these are analogous to alleles, rather than wholesale modifications.\n\n \n Sure, but I don't see why it should need to remake the Bible given that peaceful religions work just fine being peaceful without remaking it. I'd rather the historical makeup of the Bible remain than to start remaking it into what we want it to be for the sake of political correctness. The fact that some religious groups are obviously fully capable of being peaceful and compassionate with the way the Bible is now say that rewriting the Bible is not really necessary.\n \n \nThe second point, a corollary of the first, is that even within your moderate sect of christianity the bible, and hence the genes that code for fundamentalism, remain intact, requiring only the right environment to be expressed. Why should this be? Why preserve unchanged a book whose literal teachings are far from congruent with your actual beliefs? \n\n \n With all due respect, this shows a lack of undertanding of the Bible on your part. I'd say that the Bible as literal is MORE congruent with peaceful religion. That's because a straightforward reading of the Bible would lead one away from the violence of the Old Testament and toward the compassion of Christ. You are still making generalizations here, even with the Bible itself and it's content.\n \n \nWhat all these rationalisations ignore, looming like an elephant in a living room, is that no other kinds of text are allowed to hide behind these excuses. If a system of instruction performs badly, or has unwanted side-effects, it gets modified. If the principles expressed in a science book, or a management handbook, or a legal document are found wanting, they are altered, because the teachings are held responsible for how they influence people.\n\n \n If the Bible could be found to be the cause of violence (though I am convinced that causality cannot be proven), what would you do? Do you ban it? Then you've into Orwellianism and frankly, people seem capable to knowing not to do violent things as evidenced by peaceful Christian groups. Do you rewrite it? Then you lose the historicity of the Bible and at that point it's not really the Bible anymore but rather a rewritten edited text for political correctness. Even if it were found to be the cause, there's no real way to fix it. The Bible is what it is. It should be left that way, just as we would leave the statue of Buddha (which could, for instance, be remade into a thinner representation because the obesity of Buddha might lead people to not take the dangers of overeating seriously). I also think it violates some very central human freedoms to go making religious groups change their sacred texts. It just shouldn't be done.\n \n I also think it is important to point out that the Bible is under scrutiny all the time. It is constantly questioned and reevaluated. What do you think is happening right here on this forum? Scrutiny of ther Bible, of course! Anyone is free to do that, and it happens within the Christian religion too--there is a long history of critical study of the Bible going back for the last 200 years, that began mostly in Germany and has spread around the world. So the assertion I gather from you and Thelmoose that holy books are given special treatment to be exempt from scrutiny just isn't true--at least with the Bible (again, I can't speak for the Koran).\n \n \nThe third point is to observe that the changes in society that have tended to repress fundamentalist genes have been secular in nature. Larger populations, easier communication, secular education, a general reduction in poverty and its attendant fears and anxieties - these are changes to Religionland, not religion itself. But as is evident from recent developments in America, those genes are alive and well, and are ready to rise to prominence given a chance.\n\n \n Well, of course there is no way to prove that this is why religion has changed at times. The hole in your logic there is that peaceful religion existed in the distant past too, such as in the form of early Christianity which we know quite a bit about from vey early writings. It didn't have the benefit of the things you talk about above. But even if it were true that the only reason religion is peaceful is because of secular influences, it still leads to the point that religion can obviously fully function peacefully even with violent passages of the Bible remaining unedited. Whether that capability comes from outside (secular influences) or within, the capability is still there and so we know religion that uses the Bible can be peaceful and compassionate and non-violent. There's no need to fix it if it ain't broken anymore. \n \n \nEven if one were to somehow temporarily eradicate harmful interpretations of the koran or the bible or the torah, so long as moderates retain a faith-based rather than scientific attitude towards the proliferation and stasis of their holy books*, those genes need only encounter the right environment to re-express themselves, and for violence and atrocity in the defence of religion to resume - violence and atrocity which would not occur in the absence of those religious genes, and which is not ultimately in the interests of human beings. \n\n \n Let me give you an analogy: when war brings out the worst in people and causes them violence, we blame the war. In other words, we blame the environement. And environment can indeed sometimes push someone hard enough to engage in violent tendencies. In some cases, it's even necessary for the good of society. But that doesn't mean it's religion's fault. In fact, by the very fact you've introduced another variable (\"environment\") you've offered another possiblity of cause. \n \n I think it should be enough that we know people are fully capable of living out their religion by reading the Bible the way it works if you read it wholistically: that in Christ the violence of the OT was changed by his teachings and the way he lived. It obviously works because most Christians fall into this catagory. You are arguing the issue of the exceptions over the VAST rule here, I might add.\n \n And my observation is that you've sort of shifted the weight of your arguement toward \"fundamentalist genes\" rather than religion at large. This is a good thing IMO and I'm glad to see your attention shifted because it is departure from generalization. I have no problem with that. Fundamentalism IS a problem and should be discouraged. But we shouldn't punish religion as a whole over fundamentalism. You seem to have a slippery slope arguement going here that fundamentalism can raise it's ugly head anytime because the rest of religion, by keeping itself alive, keeps fundamentalism alive. To that I say, fine, then encourage the cancer of fundamentalism to be cut off from the main organism. But don't demand that the whole organism be killed over it. That's irrationally unnecessary. The overall peaceful religion seems fully capable of operating and maintaining it's peaceful nature without rewriting the Bible or getting rid of it altogether. And it's very common for the rest of the religion to frown upon and discourage fundamentalism anyway.",

   "Well, just thank God he isn't listening to the cut and run liberals, who would place everyone in serious danger! Appeasement doesn't work, Moose. Never has.\n\n \n Of course, because appeasement is the only alternative to bombing the living XXXX out of a country that had nothing to do with an attack on yours.\n \n Those who criticize George W's warmongering aren't doing so because they think terrorism should be pandered to. They're criticizing it because it won't work. You can't go to war on terrorism (much less a war on terror) because terrorists aren't fighting a war. They aren't trying to occupy your lands or take your treasure; they're trying to make you afraid - hence the damn name of their profession. Why do they want to make you afraid? Because it weakens you. A fearful country closes its borders, becomes insular and unpopular. Its economy suffers; it overspends on defence (or offence), and its capacity to act - not against the terrorists themselves, but in the ways the terrorists disagree with - becomes diminished.\n \n In this, the 9/11 bombers have been successful beyond their wildest dreams, courtesy of the American neo-con fundamentalists who just couldn't resist taking a swing at the great big curve-ball Bin Laden served up. Compare America pre-9/11 to America now. A prosperous country with a balance of payments surplus; a country where freedom of speech was sacrosanct, a country that others looked up to and voluntarily sought to emulate, is now struggling beneath a mountain of war-debt that a fearful and conservative economy cannot shrug off, and is in the process of undermining the very principles of freedom and liberty that the terrorists did not want to see exported to their own countries. Bravo Mr President!\n \n Appeasement doesn't work - as with Hitler - when appeasement is what they want. Hitler wanted other countries to dither and wring their hands and not get involved. He planned for it. What he didn't want, but eventually got, was a unified opposition who stood up to him.\n \n But that doesn't make war the right response to every kind of aggression. With terrorism, you have to think about what the terrorists want, how you're going to avoid giving it to them, and how you're going to undermine their position. The 9/11 terrorists wanted a frightened and isolated America; they wanted to reduce the chance of democracy and secularism spreading to other countries in their region, as had been gradually happening over the last century or so, and they wanted to build popular support for their cause within their own society. How do you beat people like that?\n \n Ironically, the terrorists took the first step towards beating themselves, by carrying out the atrocity in the first place. It was a huge gamble on their part: America, to the rest of the world, looked like it have been savagely mugged. Sympathy and solidarity with America worldwide rose to an all-time high. How the terrorist leaders must have held their breath!\n \n They needn't have worried. America, unable (for fear of financial reprisals) to tackle the Saudi origins of the attack, bombed terrorist footsoldiers in Afghanistan, and toppled the Taliban theocracy they'd previously helped install. Most of the outrage this caused was confined to the Arab world, concerned at the sight of sharia law being deposed in their back garden, but that was OK; another brick in the wall between the middle east and America is music to the terrorists' ears. It also didn't hurt that America promptly abandoned international law and started incarcerating and torturing people in Hotel Guantanamo, without trial. Sure, some of them probably were terrorists, but what mattered was that the world got to see America demonstrating that the much-vaunted freedoms and principles it was trying to export around the world were just so much window-dressing.\n \n Then the terrorists hit the jackpot. Seizing the reins of an America they had terrorised far beyond anything the 9/11 planes had achieved, and crying \"Wolf of Mass Destruction!\" the neo-con fundamentalists sent it charging into Iraq - a secular state vehemently opposed to islamic fundamentalist terrorism. George even called it a crusade at one point, bless him. They did a great big 'shock and awe' firework display, that was viewed with anything from unease to outright revulsion around the world. Again the world's TV screens were filled with charred bodies and rubble, only this time a lot of the bodies were tiny, and there were so very many more of them than had perished in 9/11.\n \n Short of America actually having nuked an Islamic state, I can't see how the terrorists could have done much better for themselves.\n \n Imagine now, instead of the utter fuster-cluck that actually did ensue, the president had appeared on national TV and said:\n \n \"We have been grievously harmed, and we are justifiably enraged. But the enemy who attacked us hopes we will lash out, killing innocents - as they did on 9/11. They hope to make America fearful and suspicious; fearful of the outside world and suspicious of each other, so that we might destroy from within the spirit of freedom and liberty they despise, but cannot themselves touch. They hope to make us act without thinking; act against our principles, so that countries around the world will cease to trust America, turn their faces from us, and look for guidance elsewhere. We must not do these things. We will not do them. We will not hand them victory. The instigators of this attack, we will find and we will punish, but we will do so according to the law and with every effort to avoid innocent casualties, because upholding the law and protecting innocents - wherever they may be in the world - is what America does.\"\n \n I know it's not as snappy and Hollywood as \"Bring it on\", but I think it has a certain something. For a start, it practically forces other countries to maintain their initial instinctive solidarity with America. Otherwise: \"What, you mean you don't uphold the law and protect innocents?\" It makes America look like the bigger guy, rather than the guy with the bigger gun. It stirs the patriotic spirit of Americans to defy the terrorists' demand that they be afraid. It should at least give pause to those who've been told America is the Great Satan, and make them a little less likely to fund, harbour or become terrorists themselves.\n \n Unfortunately, the men and women in charge of America at that pivotal moment were not moral consequentialists. They knew Smite was Right, and that forging the country into the shape they wanted was an end worth employing any means to attain.\n \n \nThis is nonsense. How many butchered infants from their mother's wombs can you count? \n\n \n I don't know. Is it more or less than the one dead child every three seconds in Africa, who might be saved if christian fundamentalists dropped their opposition to funding aid initiatives that advocate contraception? I think I remember a parable involving a mote and a plank you might find illuminating. I think you even have the book to hand...\n \n \nEvidently you've never been in the military and seen what conflict \"coming out\" homosexuals have on military cohesiveness like I've seen in Vietnam. \n\n \n Oooooh-kay. That's one hell of a big jigsaw piece just fell into place.\n \n \nNot only do openly gays \"act out\" on occasion, causing conflict with a large group of soldiers who's religious beliefs deem homosexual activity sin\n\n \n The problem obviously being with the gays and not the intolerance of their fellow men...\n \n \nbut I doubt there's many \"straights\" who feel comfortable sharing a shower with gays who might just be \"scoping\" them out for personal gratification.\n\n \n ...aaaand *click* goes another piece.\n \n Perhaps you're right, but then that's nothing women haven't had to contend with in social situations for the last... oooh, few tens of thousands of years - when they're not being forced to wear a bag with eye-holes by men who can't stand being responsible for managing their own desires. It might be healthy for us guys to just relax and stop stressing about it for a change.\n \n \nEven if George W. \"thought\" that, I'd take a God-fearing Christian President and cabinet over a group of spiritually-challenged secular relativist's who probably have serious problems figuring out what \"evil\" really is, much less dealing with it.\n \n \n Right, because there's nobody you want running a country more than someone who's afraid of something he can't see, hear, touch or even demonstrate to exist, which he happened to read about in a book he was given once.\n \n And would you please take some information on board? Just once? Even if I can't persuade you that absolutism is nothing to be proud of, at least stop pretending that relativism is the only alternative. I know you really get off on this 'us and them' binary XXXX, but it makes debating with you so tedious when I have to keep repeating basic truths over and over again in every post.\n \n \nNope. Tell me what your drug solution is? If you say \"legalize\" them, then you'd better start with taking up a major collection for all the future addicts\n\n \n Legalising drugs might incur an initial 'spike' of abuse (couldn't resist that one, sorry), mainly due to the novelty factor, but the legality or illegality of genuinely dangerous drugs is hardly a factor at all in how many people abuse them. If you're contemplating injecting yourself with a chemical that thickens the base of your spine in order to escape reality, cops aren't your biggest problem. Nor are drugs presently proscribed on merit. Cannabis for example is much less harmful, physically and socially, than alchohol.\n \n \nand start building more prisons for all the crimes they will commit when they're hooked and can't afford their next fix.\n \n \n Perhaps they'd be able to afford their next fix without resorting to crime if market forces were allowed to drive down the prices. The drugs they're using are dirt cheap to make; it's the incredibly high margins that illegality and restricted availability allow cartels to impose that makes them expensive on the street and thus attractive to criminals. The government could save money and eviscerate the drug-running industry at a stroke by simply supplying the addicts itself, and ceasing to fund both sides of another 'war' on a noun. I know it's not the kind of solution absolute morals endorse, but it might at least work. Remember how much organised crime profited from prohibition? They just weep for joy whenever some stiff-necked yahoo announces a 'crackdown' or some other hardline policy, because it's money in their pocket and the ones in charge aren't ever in much danger of being caught.\n \n But then, you aren't about things doing any good, are you? That's not how you measure success. Whether some law or initiative or belief helps or actively aggravates the problem, is irrelevant so long as it's \"right\". It must be so frustrating, to sit there being right about things, and have the universe truculently disagree with you so very often.\n \n \nWhere's your viable solution?\n\n \n Does he have to know how to pilot the Titanic before he can point out that it's heading for an iceberg?",

   "The 800 lb gorrila problem with you survival-of-the-fittest view of religion is that the fittest has NOT survived; religion, overall, is a lot less violent than it was 1000 to a few hundred years ago.\n\n \n Don't over-simplify. Fittest, as I made abundantly clear, does not mean 'most violent' any more than it means 'most peaceful'. It means most successful The reason religion less uniformly inspires violence these days is nothing to do with religion itself changing (how can it, when the books remain the same?), and everything to do with the environment changing to favour less literal interpretations. But these 'less literal interpretations' are still 'less literal interpretations' of something violent, bloody and intolerant.\n \n Seriously, jyoshu, I'm bemused at how you can claim the fault lies with us, when it is our decision to depart from these religious texts of our own volition and initiative that has resulted in the practice of religion becoming less violent. It defies understanding.\n \n \nI also think your cells and organism analogy doesn't fit well. There's no central organism the cells are a part of; they are all individual factions and groups.\n\n \n Only if you choose to partition them according to the way they interpret scripture. If you do the same with the human body, you would be forced to conclude that we are in fact an individual brain organism, heart organism, spleen organism etc. etc. (Not strictly genetically correct, but you get the point). Clearly this is nonsense; it is our DNA that defines us as an organism, not the selective ways that parts of us interpret it.\n \n Nor does treating the factions of a religion as parts of a single organism require centralised control. Jellyfish are colonies of organisms; sea-sponges can be passed through a seive and will reassemble on the other side: individual parts utterly unaware of what their labours are in aid of, yet their macro structure achieves something that independently they could not. I, personally, have no idea how my spleen works, and certainly wouldn't have known to include one if given the task of designing myself. Does that mean my spleen is not part of me?\n \n \nSure, but I don't see why it should need to remake the Bible given that peaceful religions work just fine being peaceful without remaking it. I'd rather the historical makeup of the Bible remain than to start remaking it into what we want it to be for the sake of political correctness. The fact that some religious groups are obviously fully capable of being peaceful and compassionate with the way the Bible is now say that rewriting the Bible is not really necessary.\n\n \n I have to confess, the way you think is truly alien to me, and a little frightening - and I've talked to EZ. \n \n Doesn't it mean anything to you that these books were once hideously damaging when taken literally, and only by gradually coming to ignore much of them have we begun to escape the cycles of violence they inspired? Are you really incapable of grasping what that implies about the content of these books?\n \n Would removing or altering the harmful parts make it harder for the peaceful interpretations to persist? Would it impact in any way upon the overall message, as you understand it? Then why, for the love of humankind, aren't you prepared to do everyone a favour and fix your book?\n \n \nIf the Bible could be found to be the cause of violence <snip< do you ban it?\n\n \n Of course not; that would only trigger the fundamentalist defense mechanisms and cause even more trouble. I don't actually have much of a plan, beyond expressing myself publicly as eloquently as possible, in order to sway undecided observers of the debate. I don't expect it to work terribly well, mind you. But not knowing how to fix a problem doesn't mean you shouldn't draw attention to it. As I told EZ, one may be perfectly capable of pointing out an oncoming iceberg without having the slightest idea how to steer around it :)\n \n \nDo you rewrite it? Then you lose the historicity of the Bible and at that point it's not really the Bible anymore but rather a rewritten edited text for political correctness.\n\n \n I'm pretty sure taking glass shards out of a child's birthday cake isn't political correctness. Your argument seems to equate to 'Well, it's a lovely big cake and there's not much glass in it, and we're pretty good at telling kids these days where the shards are, so let's just leave it alone'.\n \n \nI also think it violates some very central human freedoms to go making religious groups change their sacred texts. It just shouldn't be done.\n\n \n Bingo.\n \n I was hoping you'd say that at some point. The rest of your argument is padding; a sop to your rationality. It's a very good sop, mind you; I had to work bloody hard to get through it. This is the core, though: holy texts should not be changed and nobody should be allowed to make you change them; they just shouldn't.\n \n \nI also think it is important to point out that the Bible is under scrutiny all the time. It is constantly questioned and reevaluated. \n\n \n But never fixed. The questions and re-evaluations persist only as long as the person who makes them, and spread only to the limits of the enviroment to which they are suited. Your re-evaluations matter not one jot to EZ's interpretation, or the EZ's that comes after him, or the one after him. They can continue to find the intolerance and self-righteousness they want 'officially' justified, by looking within those pages. Nothing in what you're saying here in any way contradicts the hypothesis I laid out earlier.\n \n \nSo the assertion I gather from you and Thelmoose that holy books are given special treatment to be exempt from scrutiny just isn't true--at least with the Bible (again, I can't speak for the Koran).\n\n \n Perhaps not scrutiny in the bible's case, but certainly the kind of revisions, changes, product recalls or second editions we would be seeing elsewhere.\n \n I'm not asking that the bible as-is be destroyed or un-made (I read Orwell too); it is as you say a valuable history lesson. But if the morals it teaches are as out of date as you describe, why not put it safely on the history shelf where it belongs and create something more appropriate as the handbook of your faith? Then you would have something concrete to point to and say: \"Look how far we have come!\" And when someone acts unjustly in the name of your faith, you can say \"Nowhere in our holy book can you find justification for those acts. You are no Christian.\" Surely, if moderation and concern for human life - not to mention concern for the good name of Christianity - is as ubiquitous as you describe, this would not be found unreasonable?\n \n But then... I hit the next paragraph, and I'm not so optimistic.\n \n \nWhether that capability comes from outside (secular influences) or within, the capability is still there and so we know religion that uses the Bible can be peaceful and compassionate and non-violent. There's no need to fix it if it ain't broken anymore.\n\n \n emoticon_wow \n \n Aren't you making a rather big assumption there? No, I'm not going to tell you what it is; I want you to tell me, so that I might be convinced you are not utterly barking mad.\n \n \nIn fact, by the very fact you've introduced another variable (\"environment\") you've offered another possiblity of cause.\n\n \n We're back to the 'virus sufferer responsible for his own illness' argument again.\n \n Just as happenstance can make a person lethally vulnerable to an illness they would otherwise shrug off, so we cannot possibly hope to ensure that nobody ever finds themselves in a situation that causes them to seek justification in the bible for violence. But we can stop them finding it.\n \n \nAnd my observation is that you've sort of shifted the weight of your arguement toward \"fundamentalist genes\" rather than religion at large.\n\n \n No, I have not. The fundamentalist genes within religion might be the parts that do the most direct harm, but they are integral to the organism as a whole. It cannot survive without them, and they cannot survive without it.\n \n \nTo that I say, fine, then encourage the cancer of fundamentalism to be cut off from the main organism. But don't demand that the whole organism be killed over it. That's irrationally unnecessary.\n\n \n But fundamentalism is not a cancerous lump; it is a correctly functioning part of the organism, evolved to defend it against certain kinds of enemies and exploit opportunities to spread. You can identify and excise a cancer because its DNA is corrupt, but fundamentalists wave the same bible you do. Without gene therapy (changing the scriptures) there's no reason to suppose that the bible won't, in a year or five minutes' time, find itself in an environment ripe for it to inspire fundamentalism all over again.\n \n You think I'm seeing a problem with an aberrant part of religion, and that I'm overreacting hugely; advocating that we kill all religion in order to stamp the problem part out. Such is not the case.\n \n I merely observe that if we do what is plainly necessary to prevent fundamentalism - change the holy texts, or re-issue amended ones - then the religion is already dead, because modifying your books in response to enlightened enquiry is science.",

It means most successful The reason religion less uniformly inspires violence these days is nothing to do with religion itself changing (how can it, when the books remain the same?), and everything to do with the environment changing to favour less literal interpretations. But these 'less literal interpretations' are still 'less literal interpretations' of something violent, bloody and intolerant.\n \n Seriously, jyoshu, I'm bemused at how you can claim the fault lies with us, when it is our decision to depart from these religious texts of our own volition and initiative that has resulted in the practice of religion becoming less violent. It defies understanding.\n\n \n No, no I'm not saying anything is anyone's \"fault.\" I'm saying I don't think there is really any significant problem for there to be fault over with religion at large. At least not with religion in general. I would say the problems that have taken place in Christianity anyway, are so few in the modern era that it's not enough of a reflection of the broader religion to be an issue in this discussion. I'm not blaming fault on you or anyone else. If I gave the impression of blame, I apologize as that was not my intention at all.\n \n Now then, regarding your 1st statement that survival of the fittest re. religion is about successs (as opposed to non-violence) I don't see that the correction you've pointed out changes my point any. By far the most successful religion has been peaceful, not violent. The Crusades were a defeat for all practical purposes for Catholicism, the Inquisition was eventually ended and it's leaders gone, and colonzation attempts by England and other European countries eventually resulted in those colonies wanting independence. (and it's iffy whether those colonization attempts were the result of religion anyway.) Peaceful religion on the otherhand has never gone away, and whether it's Christian monks, Buddhism, or protestants minding their own business, they've flourished. Peaceful religion is now the norm and standard, and violent religion is by far the exception.\n \n \nOnly if you choose to partition them according to the way they interpret scripture. If you do the same with the human body, you would be forced to conclude that we are in fact an individual brain organism, heart organism, spleen organism etc. etc. (Not strictly genetically correct, but you get the point). Clearly this is nonsense; it is our DNA that defines us as an organism, not the selective ways that parts of us interpret it.\n\n \n But now you are arguing the analogy over reality. I'm saying that because religion is not so organized, your analogy doesn't go very far. I do understand the point you were making though.\n \n \nI have to confess, the way you think is truly alien to me, and a little frightening - and I've talked to EZ. \n\n \n Well, I feel the same about the way YOU think. I get pretty uneasy when people start implying the removal of personal freedoms.\n \n \nDoesn't it mean anything to you that these books were once hideously damaging when taken literally, and only by gradually coming to ignore much of them have we begun to escape the cycles of violence they inspired? Are you really incapable of grasping what that implies about the content of these books?\n\n \n I've never said the Bible didn't contain violent accounts and directives in the Old Testament. But I choose to let people live their lives and judge them according to their actions, rather than what they are reading. We don't, for instance, tell people \"you can't read the Anarchist's Cookbook.\" What we tell them is that they can't create explosives or do any of the things therein. The same applies to when people do something they read in the Bible that is against the law for whatever reason, such as if it kills people.\n \n \nWould removing or altering the harmful parts make it harder for the peaceful interpretations to persist? Would it impact in any way upon the overall message, as you understand it? Then why, for the love of humankind, aren't you prepared to do everyone a favour and fix your book?\n\n \n Again, you don't seem to have read the book in whole. The way you're looking at the Bible is like taking the murder scene out of an Agatha Christie novel and condemning it, saying the book needs to be rewritten because it's violent. If you read enough, you'll soon find that Christ in fact condemned violence, and taught the very opposite of what you're claiming the Bible is about. And as I pointed out, the fact that Christianity is peaceful other than some fringe groups shows that Christianity has, overwhelmingly, become a religion that doesn't have to do a snip job on it's texts to be peaceful. It's just obviously unnecessary. It would do you no favors for Christians to butcher up their Bible, because honestly, you just aren't in danger.\n \n \nI'm pretty sure taking glass shards out of a child's birthday cake isn't political correctness. Your argument seems to equate to 'Well, it's a lovely big cake and there's not much glass in it, and we're pretty good at telling kids these days where the shards are, so let's just leave it alone'.\n\n \n Nice try, but it just oversimplifies the matter way too much. No one gets hurt by reading . . . er, eating the cake when it comes to the Bible.\n \n \nBingo. I was hoping you'd say that at some point. The rest of your argument is padding; a sop to your rationality. It's a very good sop, mind you; I had to work bloody hard to get through it. This is the core, though: holy texts should not be changed and nobody should be allowed to make you change them; they just shouldn't.\n\n \n Er . . . I'm saying that to you. You're the one who gives the impression that you would do that, to me anyway. But I'm glad you agree. emoticon_xgood But now since you aren't interested in making religious people change their texts (as you now seem to be claiming), you're wasting your time with religious people. They know that snipping up their Bible isn't going to change human nature's equal tendency to do bad as well as good, and they know that sugarcoating a source like the Bible isn't going to change things any more than banning guns stops murders, or burning books wipes out an ideology. And for what it's worth, I don't think pointing out obvious generalization and lack of attention to the content of subject (the Bible) in question is \"padding.\" It is crucial that, if you are going to argue that the most well-loved religious text in the world be rewritten, that you be very familiar with what's truly going on in the text, as a whole. I get the impression that you aren't or else you'd agree with what I'm telling you regarding the way Christians view violence in the OT as abolished by the love of Christ. There's a reason that by far most Christians today don't do violent acts, and it's no coincidence that the era containing the most Christian violence took place when reading the Bible was not allowed for laypeople.\n \n \nYour re-evaluations matter not one jot to EZ's interpretation, or the EZ's that comes after him, or the one after him. They can continue to find the intolerance and self-righteousness they want 'officially' justified, by looking within those pages. Nothing in what you're saying here in any way contradicts the hypothesis I laid out earlier.\n\n \n Then why are you not taking up the issue with EZ and his inability to interpret scripture correctly? He's out of the mainstream. Your tactic is to punish all of religion because of EZ.\n \n \nPerhaps not scrutiny in the bible's case, but certainly the kind of revisions, changes, product recalls or second editions we would be seeing elsewhere.\n\n \n See, this brings up another problem with you argument, and I'm glad you went there because I need to point this out. The Bible is a different sort of literature than what you're talking about. It's not like a math textbook that needs revising, it's more like a copy of Homer or Shapkespeare. Now it can be pointed out (and no doubt you will) that some religious people VIEW the Bible as more like a math textbook or how-to guide. But that doesn't mean they're right in doing that--you're suggesting the equivilent of rewriting Shakespeare because someone doesn't realize it's not a how-to book. The correction should be made involving the people, not the book.\n \n \nI'm not asking that the bible as-is be destroyed or un-made (I read Orwell too); it is as you say a valuable history lesson. But if the morals it teaches are as out of date as you describe, why not put it safely on the history shelf where it belongs and create something more appropriate as the handbook of your faith? \n\n \n It wouldn't work. First, there's no central authority to mandate that in Christianity. (Again, it's not an organism.) Second, there are factors about the Bible that, I believe, would be impossible to \"shelve\" simply because they are life-changing. Christianity cannot really be without the Bible, at least in any substantive and realistic reflection of Christ (the first 5 letters of \"christianity\" and the focus of the religion). This is not a weakness of the religion, it's simply a matter of fact--Christianity is based on Christ, whom we read about in the Bible. For all practical purposes, it would cease to be the Bible. The Bible is what it is.\n \n One other thing I find interesting is that, for someone who I believe (based on your posts) feels that all religion is bad, you would want the more 'damning' parts about God removed. And it's interesting that Christians would choose to leave the more damning parts about God in place in the Bible. Christians by no means deny those parts are there; they just know that removing them doesn't really do any good. One might think it would benefit them to do so in that at least they wouldn't have to worry about people taking parts of the Bible out of the rest and condemning the whole religion for it (as you are doing). They'd rather those questionable parts be left in place. Given that they aren't engaging in violence, why do you think that is? Theres are reasons for it, and it may not what you think. But one thing is certain, by leaving those parts in, they're taking a non-hypocritical stance on it, even willing to be judged by those few parts, as you've done.\n \n \n I also notice that you've norrowed your focus considerably from an argument that all religion is bad to one of rewriting the Bible. Are you now convinced that not all religion is bad?\n \n \nAren't you making a rather big assumption there? No, I'm not going to tell you what it is; I want you to tell me, so that I might be convinced you are not utterly barking mad.\n\n \n If there's something you disagree with, then disagree. It is, after all, a forum.\n \n \nWe're back to the 'virus sufferer responsible for his own illness' argument again.\n \n Just as happenstance can make a person lethally vulnerable to an illness they would otherwise shrug off, so we cannot possibly hope to ensure that nobody ever finds themselves in a situation that causes them to seek justification in the bible for violence. But we can stop them finding it.\n\n \n huh? Did you not read what I wrote? I said environment. That's not the sufferer, that's the sufferer's environment! I don't necessarily agree that we should do that at all--if, for instance, my family is in danger from an intruder and I find justification to use violence to protect my family, what's the problem??? Again, the problem is that some are looking for an excuse to begin with. If you had a balanced position and at least felt that both the Bible AND the person bared some responsibility, I could at least feel you weren't completely biased here.\n \n Also, if you are truly interested in stopping the sources for violence, then you do realize that your logic has to deal with a lot more than religion, don't you? You'll have to eliminate EVERY possible excuse people could ever find for violence in society. Now, I don't mean to deviate from the subject of religion here, but I do think it's pertinent. Are you willing to take \"violent\" cartoons off the air and tell people they shouldn't go to R-rated movies? Because that's the sort of logic you're employing.\n \n \nNo, I have not. The fundamentalist genes within religion might be the parts that do the most direct harm, but they are integral to the organism as a whole. It cannot survive without them, and they cannot survive without it.\n\n \n Wow! On what do you based that assertion? No, not at all. If fundies were not a part of Christianity, Christianity would go on. Do you think moderate churches need fundie churches? They don't have anything to do with them. Again, factions of Christianity are simply not dependent on each other. Christianity is not organized. You've adopted the anology over reality.\n \n \nBut fundamentalism is not a cancerous lump; it is a correctly functioning part of the organism, evolved to defend it against certain kinds of enemies and exploit opportunities to spread. \n\n \n Do you really think Fred Phelps is interested in defending Christianity as a whole? No. He's out to bash gays. Do you really think Jerry Falwell is about the business of defending the Christian religion for everyone else? I don't see that. You see, Christianity is so non-organized, there are even degrees of fundamentalists. No, Christianity would function just fine without Fred Phelps.\n \n \nYou think I'm seeing a problem with an aberrant part of religion, \n\n \n No, I think your problem is with ALL religion, and that it should be with merely a part of it.\n \n \nand that I'm overreacting hugely; advocating that we kill all religion in order to stamp the problem part out. Such is not the case. I merely observe that if we do what is plainly necessary to prevent fundamentalism - change the holy texts, or re-issue amended ones - then the religion is already dead, because modifying your books in response to enlightened enquiry is science.\n\n \n Why do you think the only way to end fundamentalism is to change or reissue the texts? From what I read, fundamentalism is a misread of the texts that are already there. They simply need to be convinced of not bringing their own biases and prejudices into the text.\n \n Whew!

   "By far the most successful religion has been peaceful, not violent.\n\n \n Some native Americans might disagree with that. Oh, I'm not saying they were deprived of their country explicitly in the name of Christianity; no such histrionics were needed. The success of christianity can be largely attributed to the ease with which rich and technologically advanced Europe extended its influence around the globe; for once, christianity got a free ride and hardly needed to bare its teeth at all.\n \n \nThe Crusades were a defeat for all practical purposes for Catholicism, the Inquisition was eventually ended and it's leaders gone\n\n \n The fact that the crusades ended in defeat for one set of cells rather than the other is immaterial; one religion with violent genes was butting up against another, and the inevitable occurred. Remember, we're talking about the survival of the religion here, not its followers. \n \n In case you haven't noticed, very much the same butting-up is happening now. Isn't it a shame nobody took the trouble, in the intervening period, to remove the bits of those two religions that cause these tensions to escalate?\n \n \nPeaceful religion is now the norm and standard, and violent religion is by far the exception.\n\n \n No: the peaceful practice of religion is now the norm. The religions themselves - the core data which define the scope of likely interpretations thereof - have not changed. They remain as potent as ever.\n \n Despite religion, we have slowly and painfully extricated ourselves from the clutches of our superstitions to a position of greater enlightenment. You seem to be arguing that now, within sight of true freedom, we might as well stop; here is 'good enough'.\n \n But you are even more wrong than that. We are nowhere near free. Environmental changes may have made your moderate interpretation temporarily the fittest in many places around the world, but we are still all sitting on a time-bomb. America is attacked and pow, fundamentalism erupts and takes charge, foaming at the mouth to blow its ideological enemies straight to hell. Us and them. Right and wrong. It's that simple. Bring it on.\n \n \nI'm saying that because religion is not so organized, your analogy doesn't go very far. I do understand the point you were making though.\n\n \n Do you? You describe religion as disorganised, yet you are still thinking on the level of the groups of people it inhabits. Moderates and fundamentalists cooperate on behalf of their shared religion in ways they would never imagine. Fundamentalists make the moderates appear reasonable and virtuous. EZ does a fantastic job around here, by the way. Moderates carry the faith peacefully across borders without triggering the defences of rival ideologies, and if their presence does eventually trigger irritation, a little adversity will soon bring fundamentalism to the fore, ready to save the day. The peaceful practice of Islam has permeated many western societies, yet the suicide bombers who attacked London recently were recruited from within that peaceful sect - how? Because those who preach violence can hold up the same book moderates have already been indoctrinated to trust, and point to the passages that justify atrocity.\n \n \nWell, I feel the same about the way YOU think. I get pretty uneasy when people start implying the removal of personal freedoms.\n\n \n If that's what you think I'm implying, you really haven't understood me at all. I'm not advocating any kind of ban or restriction on practising religion, mainly because I know such a clumsy frontal assault would be counterproductive. Also, I like people; I don't want to make them miserable. The entity I have a problem with doesn't care about people at all; isn't even capable of being aware of them.\n \n The best I can manage at the moment is to provoke thought, and try to get religious people - fundamentalists if possible, but mostly moderates such as yourself - to understand the role they are playing in propagating the difficulties their religion inflicts upon humanity. You say your interpretation of your religion is harmless, and better than others, yet you say enshrining that interpretation officially, to reduce the chances of your faith being used in a manner with which you disagree - that's somehow wrong. I'd like to persuade you otherwise; I'd like to persuade you to return control of your faith to a human level.\n \n \nWe don't, for instance, tell people \"you can't read the Anarchist's Cookbook.\" What we tell them is that they can't create explosives or do any of the things therein. The same applies to when people do something they read in the Bible that is against the law for whatever reason, such as if it kills people.\n\n \n But the anarchist's cookbook doesn't claim to supercede the law. Nor does it inform the law. The bible does both. How often does EZ brandish the bible as the ultimate authority on what is right and wrong?\n \n \nAnd as I pointed out, the fact that Christianity is peaceful other than some fringe groups\n\n \n Fringe groups like the Bush administration? \n \n \nIt would do you no favors for Christians to butcher up their Bible, because honestly, you just aren't in danger.\n\n \n I'm in no danger so long as the environment in which the bible predominates remains largely affluent, relaxed and unthreatened. You assume this state will persist and improve forever; recent world events indicate otherwise.\n \n \nNice try, but it just oversimplifies the matter way too much. No one gets hurt by reading . . . er, eating the cake when it comes to the Bible.\n\n \n It's not a perfect analogy, to be sure, since it depicts the harm as always happening to the consumer. But Matthew S is harmed by EZ's reading of the bible. Tens of thousands of Iraqis were harmed by George W's reading of the bible. Not, in the latter case, because the bible explicitly told him to behave that way, but because acceptance of the bible as a holy book first requires the subjugation of reason to faith, and in teaching faith to George W someone armed him with the ability to believe - and announce publicly - that god wanted him to invade Iraq. That is actually the zero-th stage of my generalisation about religion: that in teaching any faith, no matter what it consists of, one must necessarily preach the inferiority of reason, and that is potentially dangerous.\n \n \nThey know that snipping up their Bible isn't going to change human nature's equal tendency to do bad as well as good,\n\n \n Really? Then I'm fascinated to hear your explanation for why changing what you see when you look in the bible has improved our behaviour, but changing what's written in it cannot.\n \n \nAnd for what it's worth, I don't think pointing out obvious generalization\n\n \n This would be the 'obvious generalisation' it has so far taken me two days to get you halfway towards understanding the nature of. You're so hung up on this image of me tarring all practitioners of religion with the same brush that you can't see what I'm really saying\n \n \nand lack of attention to the content of subject (the Bible) in question is \"padding.\" It is crucial that, if you are going to argue that the most well-loved religious text in the world be rewritten, that you be very familiar with what's truly going on in the text, as a whole.\n\n \n Iceberg and ship-steering again. I'm not telling anyone how to re-write it, just observing that as it stands, it evidently has the potential to be used to justify violence and intolerance (and not abused as you would have it).\n \n \nThere's a reason that by far most Christians today don't do violent acts\n \n \n But is that reason anything to do with a change to christianity? How can it be? The book remains unchanged.\n \n Given the right environment, the bible has been used to justify atrocities - both to overcome people's innate morality and get them to participate, and to get others not to kick up a stink and protest. Do you disagree?\n \n We cannot guarantee the bible will not find itself in that same environment again. Do you disagree?\n \n Even if the 'bad' biblical genes are just unfortunate accidents, and aren't, as I am convinced they are, integral to the religion's survival, isn't trying to fix them the right thing to do? You can't always be there to make sure people pick up the 'right' message - the 'right' message, by the way, that is demonstrably no better than innate human morality.\n \n \n, and it's no coincidence that the era containing the most Christian violence took place when reading the Bible was not allowed for laypeople.\n\n \n Now that's a good argument :) Very interesting. Of course, we don't really know if your assertion that it's no coincidence is correct. Nor do we know, yet, what the final deathtoll of today's outburst of fundamentalism, on all sides, will be. Perhaps it will all blow over, or perhaps it will be a massacre the like of which mankind has never seen.\n \n \nThen why are you not taking up the issue with EZ and his inability to interpret scripture correctly?\n\n \n Partly because it's pointless, but mostly because it's only your opinion that he's incorrect. As far as I can see, he's sticking much closer to the original text (he certainly quotes a lot more of it than you do). On the face of it, you're practically apostate :)\n \n \nHe's out of the mainstream. Your tactic is to punish all of religion because of EZ.\n\n \n As I already said: my observation is that to get rid of interpretations like EZ's, and ensure they never trouble us again, it is necessary for religious practitioners to take charge of their religious texts and alter them to better match what they want them to mean. Gene therapy to remove a hereditary disease, as opposed to endless chemotherapy, remission and relapse. That, in a sense, would entail the death of religions as I have described them, since they would then be subservient to humanity, rather than its masters.\n \n Bedtime again! Back tomorrow.",

The success of christianity can be largely attributed to the ease with which rich and technologically advanced Europe extended its influence around the globe; for once, christianity got a free ride and hardly needed to bare its teeth at all.\n\n \n I'm sure that played a role, but Christianity was spreading like wildfire long before that. And long before the technological advances you're referring to. If it can be traced back to a pivotal event, it would be the conversion of Constantine.\n \n \nIn case you haven't noticed, very much the same butting-up is happening now.

Do you see the difference? All you are pointing out is the different ways these groups approach religion, not how they are similar. You are actually describing their differences, not their similarities or complementary natures. The fundamentalist isn't accomodating the moderate; he's disagreeing with the moderate. And the moderate is fully capable of defending the faith without the fundamentalist; it happens all the time. If the fundie didn't take a stand his own way, the moderate would be in no more danger than otherwise. \n \n \nAlso, I like people; I don't want to make them miserable. \n \n The best I can manage at the moment is to provoke thought, and try to get religious people - fundamentalists if possible, but mostly moderates such as yourself - to understand the role they are playing in propagating the difficulties their religion inflicts upon humanity.

You say you don't want to make people miserable, but that's exactly what you would do if what you're advocating were to be done. The Bible is the heart and soul of Christianity. It's just unnecessary to edit it when most Christians don't need it edited at all, and live perfectly peaceful lives.\n \n \nBut the anarchist's cookbook doesn't claim to supercede the law. Nor does it inform the law. The bible does both.\n\n \n This is moot because the Bible very clearly advocates people follow the laws of their land. Romans 13 is very clear on this. Again, I return to my earlier comment on the need for you to be very familiar with the book you're wanting to have edited.\n \n \nBut Matthew S is harmed by EZ's reading of the bible. \n\n \n No, he's not. The only person harmed in EZ's reading might be if EZ hit his head on the reading lamp or something. There's a difference between reading the Bible and acting on it based on a given interpretation. That's what it is I'm trying so hard to get you to see--it's not the Bible or even the reading of it that's harmful. It's the way it's sometimes interpreted. If the Bible is so harmful, then why is it that most people who read it don't do harmful things as a result?\n \n \nTens of thousands of Iraqis were harmed by George W's reading of the bible. \n\n \n No, they were harmed because W sent in the troops and bombed the place. Lots of people have read the same passages he does and haven't done anything of the sort.\n \n \nNot, in the latter case, because the bible explicitly told him to behave that way, but because acceptance of the bible as a holy book first requires the subjugation of reason to faith, and in teaching faith to George W someone armed him with the ability to believe - and announce publicly - that god wanted him to invade Iraq. That is actually the zero-th stage of my generalisation about religion: that in teaching any faith, no matter what it consists of, one must necessarily preach the inferiority of reason, and that is potentially dangerous.\n\n \n Ah, I cannot tell you how many times I've run into people who think that faith and reason are juxtaposed. They don't have to be at all. And there's certainly a school of thought that would say it was also reasonable to invade Iraq as well. But you are right in that true faith in God requires reason to come second when they ARE juxtaposed. However, in my experience, I'd trust faith over human reason just because it has so much more capacity for real compassion and care for other human beings. I'd hate to think I was guided merely by cold reason.\n \n \nReally? Then I'm fascinated to hear your explanation for why changing what you see when you look in the bible has improved our behaviour, but changing what's written in it cannot.\n\n \n I don't understand what you're trying to say here.

You're so hung up on this image of me tarring all practitioners of religion with the same brush that you can't see what I'm really saying\n\n \n I certainly see what you're saying, I just don't agree with your take on it because you haven't taken into account key factors, such as the UN-unified state of religion, and the fact that most religion is benign. I'm hung up on the generalization because your generalization invalidates your argument. Do you not realize that? \n \n \nGiven the right environment, the bible has been used to justify atrocities - both to overcome people's innate morality and get them to participate, and to get others not to kick up a stink and protest. Do you disagree?\n\n \n No, but there's a difference between \"being used to justify\" and being a cause. When someone uses something else to justify an atrocity, the cause of their doing the atrocity may come from THEM and not what they're using to justify it. Do you see what I'm saying? No one here disagrees with you that the Bible has been used to justify evil, or as an excuse. The issue I have with you thinking is that you assume, without proof, that it is the cause. You're asserting a causality without proof. The only thing you can really prove is that they referred to it as justification for what they might have very well done regardless.\n \n \nPartly because it's pointless, but mostly because it's only your opinion that he's incorrect. As far as I can see, he's sticking much closer to the original text (he certainly quotes a lot more of it than you do). On the face of it, you're practically apostate :)\n\n \n Really? You think, in his arguments that he's sticking to Jesus' commands to love one's enemies and to be compassionate? See, the difference is which parts of the text are considered more important. (Sorry EZ, I didn't mean to pick on you so much in this thread, BTW. That will be my last time using you as an example like that) I also find it interesting that you apparently consider the fundamentalist's intepretation to be the more correct one. Could that be because you want to view the scriptures in the worst possible light? Considering that most Christians are NOT fundamentalist, it seems you are in the minority on that view.\n \n Lets be very clear here as well on an important matter--a fundamentalist Christian view doesn't necessarily mean someone is going to be harmed. I've not run into a single fundie in these forums that I gather doesn't know that bombing or killing others is very wrong. We don't need to be lumping all forms of fundamentalism together into one group here.\n \n \nAs I already said: my observation is that to get rid of interpretations like EZ's, and ensure they never trouble us again, it is necessary for religious practitioners to take charge of their religious texts and alter them to better match what they want them to mean. \n\n \n \"Altering\" isn't necessary. Teaching which ones are important and interpretations that are in-line with Christ-based Christianity (who taught peace and compassion) ARE necessary. There's no need to carve up sacred texts that people around the world love when interpretation already serves the purpose you call for. You're late to the game--Christianity has already been dealing with this issue for a very long time through apologetics and interpretive studies, and they've been quite successful.",

   "Hello again :)\n \n Jyoshu, if you're OK with this, I'd like to condense our debate a little; it's taking literally hours for me to compose a full reply to all the points we've explored, and I'm worried I won't be able to do them justice. I'll try to focus my arguments better in a later post.\n \n In the meantime, a word from our sponsor:\n \n \nBut after all is said and done, you can't then sit back and say ole EZ never tried to bring you the message of salvation through Jesus Christ.\n\n \n But I can say that your manner made the beliefs you peddled repellent. Based on what you say and how you say it, the heaven you claim I'll be missing out on will be full of arrogant sociopaths who have not the least bit of compassion for others. You're putting me off, EZ; I don't want to be in a heaven that has you in it. Therefore if I do end up in hell, it will be substantially thanks to your evangelising. Does that thought give you the slightest pause? Think back: is there anyone to whom you have preached who has not hardened their hearts against the version of christianity you advocate?\n \n \nForeknowledge by God does not necessarily equate to predeterminism. After all, what does the Bible say about that?\n \n \"For those God foreknew he also predestined....\" Romans 8:29\n \n Foreknowledge comes first, not predestination.\n\n \n Logic really isn't your strong suit, is it? For it to be possible for god to see what Judas would do a thousand years down the line, Judas would still have to be predestined - just not by god.\n \n More specifically:\n \n God looks ahead and sees what's going to happen. The events he sees, therefore, became inevitable from the moment he chose to look, if not earlier.\n \n But the events he is observing are sparked by his own intervention: the dispatching of Jesus to earth. Obviously Judas could not betray Jesus if Jesus did not exist. So, when did god look forward to these events?\n \n If it was before he decided to send Jesus to earth, then god himself has no free will; his decision to send Jesus - and therefore his own mind - is as predetermined as anything else. Responsibility for Judas's behaviour: nobody. No-one in this scenario has any choice in the matter, and without choice it is not fair to apportion blame. Judas's punishment, carried out mechanically by a god every bit as powerless as the man he is punishing, is utterly meaningless.\n \n Next, the possibility that the decision and observation were coincidental (in the strict sense of happening at the same time): that god used his powers of precognition while deciding what to do. In which case, god either deliberately selected a future where Judas ended up roasting, or found that there were no possible futures in which Judas (or someone, at any rate) did not betray Jesus. Since the latter implies that the crucifixion and resurrection were not actually god's idea, which kind of invalidates the whole redemption thing, we'll have to go with the former. Responsibility for Judas's behaviour: god\n \n Finally, let's assume he looked ahead after deciding to send Jesus to earth, to see what would happen. In this scenario god can still have free will, assuming that what he sees is what will happen if he doesn't interfere any more.* But from that moment onward, god is the only participant with free will. Nobody else can change their mind about anything; Jesus, Judas - they are all doomed to play out the scene god has foretold. And while god must have known what he had just done, and knowing that he was the only agent with free will, he chose to sit back and allow events to unfold.\n \n The inescapable conclusion is as follows: by deciding to send Jesus to earth, God made it possible for Judas to betray him, and thus earn his place in hell. So far, though, Judas's fate is not inevitable; he might still have free will. But when you add the fact that god looked into the future beyond Jesus's birth to the events surrounding his death, everything changes. There are only three possibilities: either Judas never had any free will anyway, god selected his future for him, or in the act of precognition, god 'collapsed the waveforms' and actively denied Judas the chance to change his mind.\n \n Where, then, is the justice in punishing Judas? One might as well hurl a man from a window and then punish him for killing the child he lands on - a child you put there.\n \n \n God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. So, you are 0-2.\n\n \n Who said anything about god rejecting them?\n \n \nShould I remind you that Jesus had his own \"fundamental\" beliefs? If mine scripturally match his who then is the bad guy?\n\n \n I'd have to say you, if I'm honest. Your bible either makes you a very unpleasant person, or fails to alleviate your natural unpleasantness. Either way, your interpretation doesn't seem to have much going for it.\n \n \nSounds like a fence sitter who will sit by and watch someone get murdered,\n\n \n Do you deliver these wholesale insults deliberately, or is it just that you don't think too hard about what you're saying? On what rationale do you equate a less hardline interpretation of the bible with lack of concern for one's fellow man?\n \n Ironically, we've already established the sort of guy who'll sit back and watch someone get murdered without lifting a finger, and it's the guy you worship.\n \n \nEZ is harmed by Matthew's attacks on the Bible. Works both ways.\n\n \n No, you're not. Matthew disagrees with your interpretation of it, and his language is perhaps coloured by how personally despicable he finds you, but you are in no way injured by his words (the archaic use of offense to mean just that no longer being in common use). You can walk away, and it is as if he isn't there. Matthew, on the other hand, cannot walk away from people with your beliefs, because you actively vote and lobby for his secular legal rights to be curtailed based upon them. It's not enough for you to know that he won't be relaxing up in heaven with you; you have to make him miserable down here too.\n \n \nWhen did Bush say God ordered him to invade the belligerents in Iraq?\n\n \n http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/10_october/06/bush.shtml\n \n \nBut not on my watch will I let people destroy traditional American values for want of their unbiblical agendas.\n\n \n \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\";\n \n Traditional American values means that the law shall make no distinction between members of any faith or of none, and shall enshrine no part of any religion in secular law. Your unfortunate homophobia, though supposedly vindicated by your holy book, is not an appropriate basis for legal discrimination. Drag America where you will, but don't kid yourself you're doing anything but urinating on the graves of your founding fathers in the process.\n \n \n \n *Imagine a computer simulation. I can fast-forward a computer simulation, and then go back and tweak things a little to obtain a different result without encountering a paradox, because I am not part of the simulation.",

Nobody else can change their mind about anything; Jesus, Judas - they are all doomed to play out the scene god has foretold. And while god must have known what he had just done, and knowing that he was the only agent with free will, he chose to sit back and allow events to unfold.\n \n The inescapable conclusion is as follows: by deciding to send Jesus to earth, God made it possible for Judas to betray him, and thus earn his place in hell. So far, though, Judas's fate is not inevitable; he might still have free will. But when you add the fact that god looked into the future beyond Jesus's birth to the events surrounding his death, everything changes. There are only three possibilities: either Judas never had any free will anyway, god selected his future for him, or in the act of precognition, god 'collapsed the waveforms' and actively denied Judas the chance to change his mind.\n \n Where, then, is the justice in punishing Judas? One might as well hurl a man from a window and then punish him for killing the child he lands on - a child you put there.\n \n \n \n Who said anything about god rejecting them?\n \n \n \n I'd have to say you, if I'm honest. Your bible either makes you a very unpleasant person, or fails to alleviate your natural unpleasantness. Either way, your interpretation doesn't seem to have much going for it.\n \n \n \n Do you deliver these wholesale insults deliberately, or is it just that you don't think too hard about what you're saying? On what rationale do you equate a less hardline interpretation of the bible with lack of concern for one's fellow man?\n \n Ironically, we've already established the sort of guy who'll sit back and watch someone get murdered without lifting a finger, and it's the guy you worship.\n \n \n \n No, you're not. Matthew disagrees with your interpretation of it, and his language is perhaps coloured by how personally despicable he finds you, but you are in no way injured by his words (the archaic use of offense to mean just that no longer being in common use). You can walk away, and it is as if he isn't there. Matthew, on the other hand, cannot walk away from people with your beliefs, because you actively vote and lobby for his secular legal rights to be curtailed based upon them. It's not enough for you to know that he won't be relaxing up in heaven with you; you have to make him miserable down here too.\n \n \n \n http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/10_october/06/bush.shtml\n \n \n \n \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\";\n \n Traditional American values means that the law shall make no distinction between members of any faith or of none, and shall enshrine no part of any religion in secular law. Your unfortunate homophobia, though supposedly vindicated by your holy book, is not an appropriate basis for legal discrimination. Drag America where you will, but don't kid yourself you're doing anything but urinating on the graves of your founding fathers in the process.\n \n *Imagine a computer simulation. I can fast-forward a computer simulation, and then go back and tweak things a little to obtain a different result without encountering a paradox, because I am not part of the simulation.\n\n \n Well, you're welcome to your beliefs. I don't agree with them but I do find you an interesting person, and I do get a chuckle out of some of your descriptive presentations. \n \n God bless you, Peeling!",

You've got no teeth to your argument without some credible evidence to back that up.\n\n \n John 7:41-43\n Others said, \"This is the Messiah.\" But some asked, \"Surely the Messiah does not come from Galilee, does he?

Matthew has Joseph and Mary already there. Luke invokes a Roman census, which - unlike any other in the history of the empire, and in defiance of the actual purpose of such a census (determining taxable income for each province), required everyone to somehow remember where their ancestors lived a thousand years ago (can you do that even now?), up-sticks and return.

   " Of course, because appeasement is the only alternative to bombing the living XXXX out of a country that had nothing to do with an attack on yours.\n\n \n Iraq violated close to twenty U.N. Resolutions. How many do you need before people finally act with something other than long-winded rhetoric?\n \n \n Those who criticize George W's warmongering aren't doing so because they think terrorism should be pandered to. They're criticizing it because it won't work. \n\n \n How would you know if you cut and run in the middle of it? Would you have cut and run in the middle of the American Revolution when it wasn't going well either?\n \n \n You can't go to war on terrorism (much less a war on terror) because terrorists aren't fighting a war. They aren't trying to occupy your lands or take your treasure; they're trying to make you afraid - hence the damn name of their profession.\n\n \n They're killing Americans on U.S. soil and they've threatened to wipe Israel off the face of the earth. That's quite a bit more than just trying to make people afraid.\n \n \n Why do they want to make you afraid? Because it weakens you. A fearful country closes its borders, becomes insular and unpopular. Its economy suffers; it overspends on defence (or offence), and its capacity to act - not against the terrorists themselves, but in the ways the terrorists disagree with - becomes diminished.\n\n \n They certainly underestimated us then. This is not the land of the \"scared\" but the land of the free BECAUSE of the brave.\n \n \n In this, the 9/11 bombers have been successful beyond their wildest dreams, courtesy of the American neo-con fundamentalists who just couldn't resist taking a swing at the great big curve-ball Bin Laden served up.\n\n \n You'd rather we bend over again rather than pasting their curve balls? That's not the American I know. Love doesn't let one's fellow Americans take that kind of stuff.\n \n \n Compare America pre-9/11 to America now. A prosperous country with a balance of payments surplus; a country where freedom of speech was sacrosanct, a country that others looked up to and voluntarily sought to emulate, is now struggling beneath a mountain of war-debt that a fearful and conservative economy cannot shrug off, and is in the process of undermining the very principles of freedom and liberty that the terrorists did not want to see exported to their own countries. Bravo Mr President!\n\n \n There were numerous attacks on American interests pre 9-11. Dead people in the first World Trade Center bombing, our warship bombed, etc., etc. Where's that in your description? \n \n \n But that doesn't make war the right response to every kind of aggression. With terrorism, you have to think about what the terrorists want, how you're going to avoid giving it to them, and how you're going to undermine their position. The 9/11 terrorists wanted a frightened and isolated America; they wanted to reduce the chance of democracy and secularism spreading to other countries in their region, as had been gradually happening over the last century or so, and they wanted to build popular support for their cause within their own society. How do you beat people like that?\n\n \n Not by bending over again and again and again. You take the fight to them, like we've done. \n \n \n It also didn't hurt that America promptly abandoned international law and started incarcerating and torturing people in Hotel Guantanamo, without trial. Sure, some of them probably were terrorists, but what mattered was that the world got to see America demonstrating that the much-vaunted freedoms and principles it was trying to export around the world were just so much window-dressing.\n\n \n What kind of Guantanamo \"torture\" are you talking about? \n \n \n Then the terrorists hit the jackpot. Seizing the reins of an America they had terrorised far beyond anything the 9/11 planes had achieved, and crying \"Wolf of Mass Destruction!\" the neo-con fundamentalists sent it charging into Iraq - a secular state vehemently opposed to islamic fundamentalist terrorism.\n\n \n This is nuts. Saddam payed the families of islamic fundamentalist suicide bombers $25K a pop. In the name of Allah he invaded Kuwait and murdered and raped people. He gassed the Kurds. He tortured and killed those who opposed him. He tried to shoot down Coalition aircraft in U.N. designated no-fly zones. He allowed Islamic terrorists in the northern Answar Al-Islam Camp to coexist in peace under his watch, so they could make ricin to try to kill British citizens. The man was every bit as evil as Hitler. We don't need to check his personal Koran to see the root of his evil. \n \n \n Again the world's TV screens were filled with charred bodies and rubble, only this time a lot of the bodies were tiny, and there were so very many more of them than had perished in 9/11.\n\n \n Defending Saddam now? Isn't that a little like defending Hitler? For the record, we don't specifically target the young and innocent like Saddam and his henchmen have been doing for ages.\n \n In closing, what is your solution to Iraq? Do a liberal cut and run so the Iranian-backed terrorists can turn Iraq into an even bigger Islamic terrorist state than Iran is currently? So they can use Iraqi oil to pay for and build more WMD's and fund more terrorist plots? Somehow, that just doesn't seem sensible. I hope you have a better plan than that.\n \n Cheers....",

   "Not sure what you're trying to say here. Jesus was born in Bethlehem and later lived in Nazareth. Some of the people in example (1) did not know he was born in Bethlehem. So what?\n\n \n The point is manifold: the earliest texts, those of Mark, unambiguously describe Jesus coming from Galilee. Then we have John, confirming this and even highlighting the discrepancy with prophecy. Only later, when the early Christians were trying to establish the facts about Jesus's early life and scouring the Old Testament for clues, do you start to see Matthew (who on several other occasions can be observed misquoting OT prophecy to better suit his ends) et al tying Jesus to Bethlehem. Luke's sleight of hand 'census' is especially revealing, as it acknowledges the problem they were facing: many people knew Jesus came from Galilee - how, then, to convince them he was the messiah of prophecy?\n \n \nIt's more like 70 kilometers, about 50 miles. Just a trek across Dallas - Ft. Worth.\n\n \n I'll suggest that to my wife when she's 8 months pregnant and see what she thinks of the idea. There was no reason for Mary to have gone: she would not have been required for the census, and travelling would have risked her entering labour miles from anywhere.\n \n \nThese charges have been answered ad nauseum over the years. They don't hold water.\n\n \n You say that, and then... nothing. Why don't they hold water?\n \n \nMost of the early Christians were Jews. How then did God turn his back on even a single soul who would receive his Son Jesus?\n\n \n It truly gladdens my heart to see you attempt to use logic to disagree with biblical quotation. Keep it up!\n \n \nI already gave you that answer in a previous post. Foreknowledge is not predeterminism. Pure and simple.\n\n \n No; not pure and simple. To forsee something and to predetermine something are not the same thing, but you cannot have foreknowledge without predeterminism.\n \n If I forsee something, then you are correct insofar as I am not necessarily predetermining it. I can watch someone throw a ball and immediately forsee where it will land, because although I am not myself predetermining the outcome, the laws of physics are. If the ball's trajectory were not predetermined - if the entity being thrown were a free agent, like a bird - I would not be able to forsee its path.\n \n Now imagine that I can forsee where the ball will land before it is thrown. Although my prophecy does not necessarily decide where the ball will land, any more than flicking to the last page in a murder mystery story 'decides' whodunnit, my ability to prophesise tells us that the events are predetermined, and that the ball-thrower is not a free agent. Replace the ball with a bird, and my ability to prophesise tells us the bird is not a free agent either.\n \n Now imagine I can forsee where the ball will land long before the person who throws it is even born. My prophecy does not necessarily cause that person to be born, travel to that place and throw a ball just so, but it does tell us that he has no choice in the matter.\n \n Thus it is with god and Judas. God's ability to know so far in advance what Judas would do in response to him sending Jesus to earth tells us that Judas had no option but to condemn himself to hell. \n \n What sense is there in punishing a ball for landing where it is thrown?\n \n \nYou can't go back. We're already there. Now what do you do differently?\n\n \n I'm glad you implicitly accept that going into Iraq was a mistake. But how does the fact the situation is now fubar exonerate those who brought it about? Of course we have to make the best of things going forward; stop stating the depressingly obvious. What critics of Bush want is for the chest-thumping hotheads who got us all into this mess to be removed from command so that they don't get another chance to make the situation worse. I'm not asking that America haul the troops out and abandon Iraq to chaos (upon this matter, I disagree with Matthew S). We're asking for someone with the intelligence and pragmatism to steer us out of this minefield.\n \n \nSo what? You still sticking up for that murderous thug, who even now is on trial for his murdering ways? You want him to have his rape rooms back? His torture chambers? The mass graves of all his innocent victims?\n\n \n Please, just stop, EZ; it's not even funny any more. \"We shouldn't have done that the way we did\" is not the same as \"We should have done nothing\" or \"We should put things back the way they were.\"\n \n Now, before I write this next paragraph, I want you to try and hold fixed in your mind the fact that I believe the 9/11 terrorists were evil and wrong to do what they did, and that I am in no way condoning or excusing or apologising for their actions. What I want to do is change your understanding of them.\n \n The 9/11 bombers' objective was not to bring down the twin towers. Nor was it to kill the people inside them, or the people on the planes, or the heroic firefighters who died running into something that lesser men would scramble over one another to escape. The death and destruction caused that day, they would coldly describe as collateral damage.\n \n Their objective was to harm America's ability to spread its 'ungodly' democratic influence, and they decided they could not do that without killing thousands of innocent people; that their goals justified those deaths. Just as America's leaders decided they could not topple Saddam without the sacrifice of tens of thousands of innocent Iraqis; that their goals justified those deaths.\n \n 9/11 was a terrorist attack. America's opening salvo on Iraq was described as a 'Shock and awe' campaign. Exactly how is dropping bombs and killing people to inspire terror significantly different to dropping bombs and killing people to inspire shock and awe? In neither case is the objective the destruction of what is beneath those bombs. That's just collateral damage.\n \n Even assuming for the moment that the terrorists really did target the twin towers in order to specifically kill those inside - how is it worse to believe someone to be an enemy and strike at him, than to know the people you're killing are innocent but decide it doesn't matter?\n \n Now, we're out the other side - have you still got that idea fixed in your head? The 9/11 bombers were wrong. I do not agree with their actions, I just disagree with both theirs and America's since then. I do not believe America should have done nothing, I believe America should not have done what it did. Can we therefore avoid the usual stupid, distracting, strawman rhetorical questions that cast my basic humanity in doubt?",

In addition, Iraqi media is reporting that Saddam used the Gulf War anniversary to threaten Israel once again.\n \n In a televised speech broadcast today and a discussion with Palestinian Authority official Farouk Kaddoumi, the Iraqi leader said he would shell Israel daily for six months from land and sea in order to bring about Palestinian independence. Saddam said that Israel could not withstand an artillery bombardment, adding that Iraq would do it if the Arab world support the decision, according to ISRAEL RADIO.\n \n In his speech, Saddam repeatedly invoked the name of Allah in claiming victory over a long list of nations in the \"immortal mother of all battles\" - despite the fact Iraqi forces were pummeled by six weeks of allied air strikes and then routed from occupied Kuwait in a matter of hours in February 1991.\n \n http://www.worthynews.com/news-features/inside-mid-east-peace-151.html\n\n \n You know nothing. \n \n http://www.abc.net.au/news/justin/nat/newsnat-12feb2003-37.htm\n \n http://www.beliefnet.com/story/123/story_12372_1.html\n \n https://www.kumawar.com/opbint/chronology.php\n \n http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iraq/2003/06/iraq-030618-21e4c91e.htm\n \n http://today.reuters.com/News/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=COL128247\n \n To recap:\n 1) Saddam banned numerous religious holidays\n 2) Saddam executed numerous religious leaders (Including Sadr's Father)\n 3) Saddam executed numerous iraqi Shiites\n 4) Saddam was called a infidel by Bin Laden\n 5) Saddam imprisoned numerous religious leaders\n \n Does a religious leader engage in numerous behavior aganist religion?

   "The point is manifold: the earliest texts, those of Mark, unambiguously describe Jesus coming from Galilee.\n\n \n Mark starts when Jesus was fully grown and didn't include a birth narative. And there is evidence that Matthew was the first Gospel written, i.e., \n \n Were you familiar with Eusebius (who quotes Origen), you would know that \"the first (Gospel) was written by Matthew...and was prepared for the converts from Judaism\" (Ecclesiastical History, 6:25). There is also additional evidence that it was originally written in Hebrew. Eusebius quotes Papias as stating, \"\"Matthew put together the oracles in the Hebrew language, and each one interpreted them as best he could.\" Irenaeus wrote, \"Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome and laying the foundations of the church.\n \n \nThere was no reason for Mary to have gone: she would not have been required for the census, and travelling would have risked her entering labour miles from anywhere.\n\n \n Au contraire. Since they were not formally married yet (Matthew 1:18) then Mary had to register also. It likely wasn't optional.\n \n \nNo; not pure and simple. To forsee something and to predetermine something are not the same thing, but you cannot have foreknowledge without predeterminism.\n \n If I forsee something, then you are correct insofar as I am not necessarily predetermining it. I can watch someone throw a ball and immediately forsee where it will land, because although I am not myself predetermining the outcome, the laws of physics are. If the ball's trajectory were not predetermined - if the entity being thrown were a free agent, like a bird - I would not be able to forsee its path.\n \n Now imagine that I can forsee where the ball will land before it is thrown. Although my prophecy does not necessarily decide where the ball will land, any more than flicking to the last page in a murder mystery story 'decides' whodunnit, my ability to prophesise tells us that the events are predetermined, and that the ball-thrower is not a free agent. Replace the ball with a bird, and my ability to prophesise tells us the bird is not a free agent either.\n \n Now imagine I can forsee where the ball will land long before the person who throws it is even born. My prophecy does not necessarily cause that person to be born, travel to that place and throw a ball just so, but it does tell us that he has no choice in the matter.\n \n Thus it is with god and Judas. God's ability to know so far in advance what Judas would do in response to him sending Jesus to earth tells us that Judas had no option but to condemn himself to hell.\n\n \n Nice try. But Judas made up his own mind. God just foreknew what his OWN CHOICE would be. \n \n \n I'm glad you implicitly accept that going into Iraq was a mistake.\n\n \n Never said that. Most people agree Saddam was evil and that the world is better off without him at the helm. \n \n \n I'm not asking that America haul the troops out and abandon Iraq to chaos (upon this matter, I disagree with Matthew S). We're asking for someone with the intelligence and pragmatism to steer us out of this minefield.\n\n \n You need to elaborate more and define what specific actions you or someone else should take that would \"steer us out of this minefield.\" \n \n \nThe 9/11 bombers' objective was not to bring down the twin towers. Nor was it to kill the people inside them, or the people on the planes, or the heroic firefighters who died running into something that lesser men would scramble over one another to escape. The death and destruction caused that day, they would coldly describe as collateral damage.\n\n \n Listen, first they cut the throats of the pilots and kill them, and also some of the Stews, and slam fuel-laden passenger Jets into occupied buildings, and you're expecting me to believe they didn't want to kill anyone? That's unfathomable.\n \n \n9/11 was a terrorist attack. America's opening salvo on Iraq was described as a 'Shock and awe' campaign. Exactly how is dropping bombs and killing people to inspire terror significantly different to dropping bombs and killing people to inspire shock and awe? \n\n \n We were taking out an evil dictator and his heinous war machine that had already murdered hundreds of thousands of innocents. The terrorist weren't, except in their twisted little minds.",

You again show you do not understand what happened. US support of Iraq was merely to balance Iran, not remove it. The aide the US sent to Iraq after seveal major losses aganist Iran was specifically not designed to tip the balance of power. Obviously whoever allocated the arms didn't do this properly or misjudged. I see you do not want to deal with the fundemental lacking in your own claims.\n \n \nYour 20 / 20 hindsight / Monday morning quarterbacking is breathtaking. If I remember correctly you liberals were trying to scare people by estimating 20,000 or more U.S. casualties in the initial invasion. You were wrong.\n\n \n Not really. And i'm hardly a liberal. I'm probably far more conservative then you will ever be. The invasion was never in doubt of success and low casulities. Most of the losses in the invasion were due to weaknesses in the supply lines from the faster then predicted advances. Everyone who understands the military knew Iraq's forces were a joke. Even Kuwait could manage a small scale invasion in 2002 without taking serious losses. The fact that Saudi Arabian forces no longer kept significent amounts of troops on their border with Iraq should have told you something, but it was already quite clear you are completley ignorant of contemporary history and military issues. What was argued and was proven to be correct, was that the necessary troop levels were not given. Shinseki was right, we needed 500,000+ troops. Rumsfeld essentially fired him for that comment. At the most recent Westpoint reunion and graduation, many of the officers wore \"Ric was Right\" hats for a reason. I was aganist the war because Iraq was not a threat and we had far greater issues to deal with, such as Pakistan's nuclear blackmarket, North Korea, etc. Trying to label me will only make you look stupid and foolish. \n \n \nBull. Tell that to the Kuwaities and the families of terrorist suicide bombers who no doubt were encouraged in their heinous bombings by Saddam's gift of $25K to those families.\n\n \n You again are ignoring that the suicide bombing happened for years before and are still happening.\n \n It's called logic. If occurance A happens before influence B enters the picture and still happens after influence B leaves, what is the conclusion of such a picture? \n \n \nUse some common sense. You want us to invade North Korea and risk probable nuclear war with China? Or invade Iran right now instead of going through the U.N. debate process like you guys always harp about? Etc., etc.\n\n \n You should be supporting it, after it is the same rational for invading Iraq. But you're a hypocrite so I can't expect the same kind of reasoning. If Iraq should have been invaded for its human rights abuses, so should China, N. Korea and most of Africa, according to your claims.\n \n \n\n Yeah, that's real secular, alright!\n\n \n Since when did one propaganda speech change his entire 20+ years of executing, imprisoning and oppressing religion? Again, you show you know absolutely nothing about the history of Iraq.\n \n And I bet you didn't evne read a single link. \n \n \nReally? Do they also bind their hands together and shoot them in the heads, etc., when they bury them in mass graves? LOL!!\n\n \n Relatively few of those were found, and of those found the bodies didn't exceed more then 20. \n \n \nReally? Are you an Army war veteran like I am, with two tours of duty in combat zones? \n\n \n You're lying. No combat veteran is that ignorant of how the military works much less the capabilities of a long term enemy. \n \n \nThis is nuts. The Kurdish military (if you want to call it that) had grossly fewer tanks, fewer combat aircraft (or any at all), fewer military personnel, and a significant, inferior number of armaments / artillery to wage war, compared to Saddam's military machine.\n\n \n The Pershamaga didn't need a airforce. You don't need tanks to defeat tanks. Seriously, how can you can be a veteran and think like that? The biggest threat to armor today is from the air and from infantry. Not from enemy tanks. I know you're lying about being a veteran. Not to mention that iraq never recovered from the iranian war, much less desert storm. The Pershamaga have proven themselves strong enough to push back Turkish forces who are far better trained, equipped and armed then Iraq was 20 years ago. Really, Daewoo would crush you like a bug if he got wind of what you thought of Iraq's prewar military. \n \n \nNope. If the Kurds could have taken out Saddam, they would have done it after Saddam gassed them. Why do you suppose they didn't?\n\n \n Again, you are lying about being a veteran. The Pershamaga can defend agnaist a conventional attack. Long range chemical warfare is something entirely different. Plus the Kurds had little reason to remove Saddam as he was unable to touch them after. \n \n \nOnce again, now that we're in Iraq and can't go back, tell us all what your wonderful solution is?

   "Mark starts when Jesus was fully grown and didn't include a birth narative.\n\n \n Mark says where Jesus was from. If you want to call him a liar, be my guest.\n \n \nNice try. But Judas made up his own mind. God just foreknew what his OWN CHOICE would be.\n\n \n Then how could it be a choice? A choice involves at least two possibilities; you're describing only one. Really, EZ, if you're going to successfully argue with people - and by that I mean convincing others, rather than simply remaining convinced yourself - you need to at least know what counts as valid logic.\n \n \nNever said that. Most people agree Saddam was evil and that the world is better off without him at the helm. \n\n \n Taken in isolation, him not being in power any more is great. Taken in the context of what was done to remove him, the world has become a more dangerous place (What remained of Saddam's army after GW1 was already crippled, and posed little serious threat to his immediate neighbours, let alone western countries), and America has become the most hated and feared country in the world. If you think that's a fair trade, I guess you're right.\n \n \nYou need to elaborate more and define what specific actions you or someone else should take that would \"steer us out of this minefield.\"\n\n \n You know, I really don't. If my car's broke and the first mechanic breaks it even more, I'll take it to another. If my tooth hurts and the first dentist makes it hurt worse, I'll go to another. Are you getting the point yet?\n \n \nListen, first they cut the throats of the pilots and kill them, and also some of the Stews, and slam fuel-laden passenger Jets into occupied buildings, and you're expecting me to believe they didn't want to kill anyone? That's unfathomable.\n\n \n That isn't what I said, and you know full well that isn't what I said. Killing the crew was not the objective, it was just a necessary part of achieving their ultimate goal. What makes them evil and wrong is that they were OK with that. They didn't think \"Hang on, to hurt America we're going to have to kill thousands of innocents; screw that!\". Just as Bush et al (and you, for that matter) didn't think \"Hang on, if we shock and awe the people of Iraq we're going to kill tens of thousands of innocents; screw that!\"\n \n Is any of this penetrating?\n \n \nWe were taking out an evil dictator and his heinous war machine that had already murdered hundreds of thousands of innocents. The terrorist weren't, except in their twisted little minds.\n\n \n But EZ - for them it was a matter of faith. You know, the sort where evidence doesn't matter, and you just listen to your priests and read your little book, and ignore anyone who protests? It's - what's that word again? Unfathomable how you of all people can fail to empathise with that kind of attitude.",

   "Amusing. You again show you do not understand what happened. US support of Iraq was merely to balance Iran, not remove it. The aide the US sent to Iraq after seveal major losses aganist Iran was specifically not designed to tip the balance of power. Obviously whoever allocated the arms didn't do this properly or misjudged. I see you do not want to deal with the fundemental lacking in your own claims.\n \n \n \n Not really. And i'm hardly a liberal. I'm probably far more conservative then you will ever be. The invasion was never in doubt of success and low casulities. Most of the losses in the invasion were due to weaknesses in the supply lines from the faster then predicted advances. Everyone who understands the military knew Iraq's forces were a joke. Even Kuwait could manage a small scale invasion in 2002 without taking serious losses. The fact that Saudi Arabian forces no longer kept significent amounts of troops on their border with Iraq should have told you something, but it was already quite clear you are completley ignorant of contemporary history and military issues. What was argued and was proven to be correct, was that the necessary troop levels were not given. Shinseki was right, we needed 500,000+ troops. Rumsfeld essentially fired him for that comment. At the most recent Westpoint reunion and graduation, many of the officers wore \"Ric was Right\" hats for a reason. I was aganist the war because Iraq was not a threat and we had far greater issues to deal with, such as Pakistan's nuclear blackmarket, North Korea, etc. Trying to label me will only make you look stupid and foolish. \n \n \n \n You again are ignoring that the suicide bombing happened for years before and are still happening.\n \n It's called logic. If occurance A happens before influence B enters the picture and still happens after influence B leaves, what is the conclusion of such a picture? \n \n \n \n You should be supporting it, after it is the same rational for invading Iraq. But you're a hypocrite so I can't expect the same kind of reasoning. If Iraq should have been invaded for its human rights abuses, so should China, N. Korea and most of Africa, according to your claims.\n \n \n \n Since when did one propaganda speech change his entire 20+ years of executing, imprisoning and oppressing religion? Again, you show you know absolutely nothing about the history of Iraq.\n \n And I bet you didn't evne read a single link. \n \n \n \n Relatively few of those were found, and of those found the bodies didn't exceed more then 20. \n \n \n \n You're lying. No combat veteran is that ignorant of how the military works much less the capabilities of a long term enemy. \n \n \n \n The Pershamaga didn't need a airforce. You don't need tanks to defeat tanks. Seriously, how can you can be a veteran and think like that? The biggest threat to armor today is from the air and from infantry. Not from enemy tanks. I know you're lying about being a veteran. Not to mention that iraq never recovered from the iranian war, much less desert storm. The Pershamaga have proven themselves strong enough to push back Turkish forces who are far better trained, equipped and armed then Iraq was 20 years ago. Really, Daewoo would crush you like a bug if he got wind of what you thought of Iraq's prewar military. \n \n \n \n Again, you are lying about being a veteran. The Pershamaga can defend agnaist a conventional attack. Long range chemical warfare is something entirely different. Plus the Kurds had little reason to remove Saddam as he was unable to touch them after. \n \n \n \n Accountability. \n \n really, stop lying about being a veteran.\n\n \n Two things for you, besides all your deluded explanations:\n \n 1. YOU STILL HAVE NOT COME UP WITH A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR WHAT WE'RE DOING IN IRAQ. Why is that? Are you incapable of formulating a credible plan commensurate with your self-declared intellectual superiority?\n \n 2. Your calling me a liar about my Vietnam military duty is itself a vicious lie, based on ignorance. Where were you during Tet '68? You numbah 10 thou dinky dow, as they used to say in Nam. Did you ever go on R&R to Sydney and go to the Whiskey a Go-Go, or the Auto Club, or take the ferry across Sydney Harbor to the zoo? Did you ever take a 3-day \"In Country R&R\" to Vung Tau, or visit Third Field Hospital in Ton Son Nhut? Do you know what \"Camp LBJ\" is? Or visit the PX in Cholon? Do you know what area 408 is? Did you hate the ham and lima bean C-Rats like most of us? Do you know what hand gesture to use with a Vietnamese to ask him / her to come towards you? I even have an ARCOM (Army Commendation) medal for \"meritorious service in the Republic of Vietnam...\", signed by Creighton W. Abrams, Commanding General (of U.S. troops in Vietnam) and also signed by Stanley R. Resor, Secretary of the Army, dated the 23rd day of June, 1969.

   "With regard to Jesus's inconveniently incorrect birthplace:\n \n [easyrider quote]\n \n John 7:41-43\n Others said, \"This is the Messiah.\" But some asked, \"Surely the Messiah does not come from Galilee, does he? Has not the scripture said that the Messiah is descended from David and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David lived?\" So there was a division in the crowd because of him.\n \n Mark 6:1\n And he went out from thence, and came into his own country [Galilee]; and his disciples follow him.\n \n Mark 1:9\n And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.\n \n Then there are the discrepancies between the bits of the bible that do describe Jesus being born in Bethlehem. Matthew has Joseph and Mary already there. Luke invokes a Roman census, which - unlike any other in the history of the empire, and in defiance of the actual purpose of such a census (determining taxable income for each province), required everyone to somehow remember where their ancestors lived a thousand years ago (can you do that even now?), up-sticks and return. Not only that, but for the birth to have taken place where it was 'supposed to', Joseph would have had to - quite unnecessarily - haul his heavily pregnant wife the hundred kilometres or so with him.\n \n Even that, however, cannot compare for sheer laugh-out-loud absurdity with the prophecy that Jesus would be born of the line of David. Mary was not of the line of David - and can you spot the problem with Joseph?\n \n Oh, by the way, I managed to answer one of my own questions:\n \n Who said god turned his back on the jews?\n \n Mat 8:11 \n And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.\n \n But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n \n [easyrider quote]\n \n Thanks, but logic is not belief. Can you find fault with my logic? Can you explain your contrary view, that the only entity with free will in that situation (god) is somehow not responsible for what happened?\n \n If you cannot, then what? Will you just ignore the contradiction, and take pride in that ignorance because it proves the strength of your faith? Will you, perhaps, accept that the punishment of Judas is something you would disagree with? Or will you consider the most likely option: that the New Testament had a few blanks filled in and a few facts massaged by early Christians eager to make sure their messiah ticked the right prophetic boxes?\n \n PS: jyoshu, bear with me :)\n\n \n This is post 132, the point where EZ decided to change subject, obviously something here rattled him.

My point was on accountability for those who messed up the operation in the first place. \n \n \n2.

You numbah 10 thou dinky dow, as they used to say in Nam. Did you ever go on R&R to Sydney and go to the Whiskey a Go-Go, or the Auto Club, or take the ferry across Sydney Harbor to the zoo?

So you read a few books about the vietnam war. That doesn't make you a veteran.\n \n Real veterans understand what they are talking about.

Post 9-11 you had to take that seriously, especially when the man was Saddam Hussein. We also don't know what Saddam shipped out to Syria, etc., i.e.\n \n Saddam agents on Syria border helped move banned materials\n \n Aug. 16, 2004\n \n By Rowan Scarborough\n THE WASHINGTON TIMES\n \n Saddam Hussein periodically removed guards on the Syrian border and replaced them with his own intelligence agents who supervised the movement of banned materials between the two countries, U.S. investigators have discovered. \n \n The recent discovery by the Bush administration's Iraq Survey Group (ISG) is fueling speculation, but is not proof, that the Iraqi dictator moved prohibited weapons of mass destruction (WMD) into Syria before the March 2003 invasion by a U.S.-led coalition. \n \n Two defense sources told The Washington Times that the ISG has interviewed Iraqis who told of Saddam's system of dispatching his trusted Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS) to the border, where they would send border inspectors away. The shift was followed by the movement of trucks in and out of Syria suspected of carrying materials banned by U.N. sanctions. Once the shipments were made, the agents would leave and the regular border guards would resume their posts. \n \n \"If you leave it to border guards, then the border guards could stop the trucks and extract their 10 percent, just like the mob would do,\" said a Pentagon official who asked not to be named. \"Saddam's family was controlling the black market, and it was a good opportunity for them to make money.\" \n Sources said Saddam and his family grew rich from this black market and personally dispatched his dreaded intelligence service to the border to make sure the shipments got through.\n \n The ISG is a 1,400-member team organized by the Pentagon and CIA to hunt for Saddam's suspected stockpiles of WMD, such as chemical and biological agents. So far, the search has failed to find such stockpiles, which were the main reason for President Bush ordering the invasion of Iraq to remove Saddam.\n \n But there is evidence of unusually heavy truck traffic into Syria in the days before the attack, and with it, speculation that some of the trucks contained the banned weapons.\n \n \"Of course, it's always suspicious,\" the Pentagon official said. \n \n The source said the ISG has confirmed the practice of IIS agents going to the border. Investigators also have heard from Iraqi sources that this maneuver was done days before the war at a time of brisk cross-border movements. \n That particular part of the disclosures has not been positively confirmed, the officials said, although it dovetails with Saddam's system of switching guards at a time when contraband was shipped. \n \n The United States spotted the heavy truck traffic via satellite imagery before the war. But spy cameras cannot look through truck canopies, and the ISG has not been able to determine whether any weapons were sent to Syria for hiding. \n \n In an interview in October, retired Lt. Gen. James R. Clapper Jr., who heads the U.S. agency that processes and analyzes satellite imagery, said he thinks that Saddam's underlings hid banned weapons of mass destruction before the war.\n \n \"I think personally that those below the senior leadership saw what was coming, and I think they went to some extraordinary lengths to dispose of the evidence,\" said Gen. Clapper, who heads the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. \"I'll call it an 'educated hunch.' \" He added, \"I think probably in the few months running up prior to the onset of combat that I think there was probably an intensive effort to disperse into private homes, move documentation and materials out of the country. I think there are any number of things that they would have done.\" \n \n Of activity on the Syrian border, Gen. Clapper said, \"There is no question that there was a lot of traffic, increase in traffic up to the immediate onset of combat and certainly during Iraqi Freedom. ... The obvious conclusion one draws is the sudden upturn, uptick in traffic which may have been people leaving the scene, fleeing Iraq and unquestionably, I'm sure, material as well.\" \n \n He also said, \"Based on what we saw prior to the onset of hostilities, we certainly felt there were indications of WMD activity. ... Actually knowing what is going on inside a building is quite a different thing than, say, this facility may well be a place where there may be WMD.\" \n \n The Iraq Survey Group, which periodically briefs senior officials and Congress, is due to deliver its next report in September. In addition to interviewing hundreds of Iraqis, the ISG has collected and cataloged millions of pages of documents, not all of which have been fully examined.\n \n Although Syria and Iraq competed for influence in the region, they shared the same Ba'athist socialist ideology and maintained close ties at certain government levels. The United States accused Syria during the war of harboring some of Saddam's inner circle. \n \n http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040816-011235-4438r.htm\n \n What else did Saddam move that we don't know about? \n \n Now, what do you want to do about Iran? Wait until something happens and then do your usual Monday morning quarterbacking?\n \n p.s. I think you also need to explain why you ran from military duty?",

   "\n \n Please tell me EZ, where are the weapons? \n\n \n Perhaps you are the one with the reading comprehension problem. Here's a second source: \n \n Saddam's WMDs are in Syria\n \n Posted: June 29, 2004\n 1:00 a.m. Eastern\n \n By Michael Evans\n \n \u00a9 2004 WorldNetDaily.com \n \n There is mounting evidence that at least some of Saddam Hussein's missing weapons of mass destruction are in Syria, smuggled there by the Iraqi dictator for safekeeping before the beginning of the war. Part of the stockpile the coalition forces have so far failed to find in Iraq was probably destroyed; part is likely still hidden. But a massively lethal amount of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons is stored alongside Syria's own stockpiles of WMDs. \n \n Perhaps more worrisome, there are indications these weapons are not under the control of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Rather, in a potentially catastrophic palace intrigue, his sister, Bushra, and her husband, Gen. Assaf Shawkat, the No. 2 in Syria's military intelligence organization, the Mukhabarat, are said to have made the storage arrangements with Saddam as part of a bid for power. \n \n \n On Jan. 5, 2004, Nizar Nayouf, a Syrian journalist who recently defected to France, said in a letter to the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that chemical and biological weapons were smuggled from Iraq into Syria before the war began, when Saddam realized he would be attacked by the U.S. Nayouf claimed to know three sites where Iraq's WMDs are kept: in tunnels under the town of al-Baida in northern Syria, part of an underground factory built by North Korea for producing a Syrian version of the Scud missile; in the village of Tal Snan, adjacent to a Syrian Air Force base; and in Sjinsjar, on the border with Lebanon. \n \n Speaking to the British television station ITN on Jan. 9, Nayouf quoted a Syrian military intelligence official as confirming the three sites. \n \n Nayouf's claims had in fact been substantiated by the U.S. intelligence community two months before. In a briefing to defense reporters on Oct. 30, 2003, officials of the National Imagery and Mapping Agency in Washington released an assessment that Iraqi weapons of mass destruction were transferred to Syria in the weeks before the war began. \n \n The officials said the assessment was based on satellite images of convoys of Iraqi trucks that poured into Syria in February and March 2003. According to Middle East Newsline, quoted by WorldTribune.com, most of the intelligence community concluded that at least some of Iraq's WMDs, along with Iraqi scientists and technicians, was smuggled to Syria. \n \n NIMA chief James Clapper, a retired Air Force general and a leading member of the U.S. intelligence community, told reporters he linked the disappearance of Iraqi WMDs with the large number of Iraqi trucks that crossed into Syria before and during the U.S. invasion. The assessment was that these trucks contained missiles and WMD components banned by the United Nations Security Council. \n \n \"I think personally that the [Iraqi] senior leadership saw what was coming and I think they went to some extraordinary lengths to dispose of the evidence,\" Clapper said. He said he is certain that components connected to Iraq's biological, chemical, and nuclear programs were sent to Syria in the weeks prior to and during the war. \n \n David Kay, the recently resigned head of an American WMD search team in Iraq, confirmed that part of Saddam's weapons was hidden in Syria, Britain's Sunday Telegraph reported on Jan. 25, 2004. Kay said he had uncovered conclusive evidence shortly before last year's U.S. invasion. \n \n \"We are not talking about a large stockpile of weapons, but we know from some of the interrogations of former Iraqi officials that a lot of material went to Syria before the war, including some components of Saddam's WMD program,\" Kay said. \n \n Gal Luft, a former analyst for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, confirmed Iraqi WMDs are hidden in Syria, but not by the regime. \n \n http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/printer-friendly.asp?ARTICLE_ID=39182",

For someone who says he was in the army, you sure don't seem to understand chemical warfare, and that I know for a fact is taught even as far back as Vietnam. \n \n \nAnd if Saddam was so secular, why did he repeatedly invoke the name of Allah to the masses?\n\n \n For the same reason that Dubya only brings out religion when he has a tough decisions to make: politics. \n \n If Saddam was so religious why did he have thousands of religious leaders imprisoned and horribly executed? Why did he ban numerous Islamic holidays? Why did he ban Sharia? Why did he support broad secular laws despite numerous threats to his life by Sharia suppoters? Why was he the target of islamic terrorists on several occasions?\n \n At least have the basic dignity to admit you are wrong. That's a clear sign you were never in the military. The military instills maturity, the maturity to admit error. \n \n You have no answer because you don't want to answer. At least you admit you have no background in manufacturing or business. According to you, you can sell a product which doesn't exist and cannot be built in any way. \n \n Again you fail to address your erronous arguments on the Iraqi threat, going so far as to COMPLETELY remove that part of my post.\n \n You are desperately trying to avoid a discussion on the Iraqi military threat for a reason.\n \n The reason you can't address Iraq's military weakness is because not only are you wrong but you lack the maturity to admit it. If I was so wrong you would have refuted my points. Instead you desperate are trying to avoid discussing how Iraq's military was in shambles from desert storm and presented no real threat to largely anyone. That itself rips a giant hole in your fundemental argument and just like Marc9000 it is simply easier to ignore how you are wrong rather then in a adult manner, deal with it. You specifically removed a part of my post (while leaving the rest) for a specific reason: it highlights just why you fail. \n \n I'll keep posting that until you deal with it.",

Again, you think you can sell a tangible service or product you have no capacity to make, build, store or move. How I have no idea but I think in rational terms.\n \n Secondly, what I was refering to was your idiotic notion that Iraq's military was a threat to anyone. You've clearly avoided discussing this subject SINCE I ripped your asinine comments to pieces pages back.\n \n How was Iraq a threat to anyone when its neighbors stopped placing significent forces on their borders prior to the war? How was it a threat when it had no navy and no airforce? How was it a threat when it was using technology that most 3rd world forces stopped using years ago? How was it a threat when the armorless Kurds could run the north as their own nation without fear of a Iraqi attack?\n \n You are wrong, at least have the basic human dignity to admit it. Btw, failing to shows you don't have such dignity nor have the maturity the miltiary insitils in its soldiers.\n \n \nFor instance, you totally dodged my question about what you would do now with Iran, who many believe is building nuclear weapons and / or other possible WMD's. Why is that?\n\n \n Largely because the US is running around using gun point democracy and Iran was named by Bush as a target and the US doesn't have the will or force to remove Iran's program. If I was a non-democratic nation just cited as a target by the best military in world, I'd be getting nukes ASAP. So really, the adminstration you support is causing your problems. Funny how that works. We don't have a answer to Iran because the adminstration failed to provide or dismissed options. You always keep your options open. That;'s another clear sign you have no history in business\n \n \nAnd you did dodge military service. You obviously love living off the sacrifices of others, rather than do the manly thing and serve yourself.\n\n \n Well, if I did dodge military service, so did around a 300-500 million Americans as well. \n \n Who said I was a male?\n \n btw: you still never answered these questions\n \n If Saddam was so religious why did he have thousands of religious leaders imprisoned and horribly executed? Why did he ban numerous Islamic holidays? Why did he ban Sharia? Why did he support broad secular laws despite numerous threats to his life by Sharia supporters?

Baghdad has chemical and biological weapons as well as missiles with ranges in excess of UN restrictions. If left unchecked it probably will have a nuclear weapon within this decade.\n \n Chemical Weapons: The CIA document expressed no doubt that Iraq had large stocks of chemical weapons. \"We assess that Baghdad has begun renewed production of mustard, sarin, GF (cyclosarin), and VX,\" it said. \"Saddam probably has stocked at least 100 metric tons (MT) and possibly as much as 500 MT of CW agents - much of it added in the last year.\" (\"CW\" refers to \"chemical warfare\" agents.)\n \n Biological Weapons: The document also said \"we judge\" that Iraq had an even bigger germ-warfare program than before the first Gulf War in 1991. \"We judge Iraq has some lethal and incapacitating BW agents and is capable of quickly producing and weaponizing a variety of such agents, including anthrax, for delivery by bombs, missiles, aerial sprayers, and covert operatives,\" the report said. (\"BW\" refers to \"biological warfare.\")\n \n http://www.factcheck.org/article358.html\n \n Nor were they alone in accepting Saddam's WMD program as a fact. Iraq previously had tried to build a nuclear facility with the capability to produce weapons -- until the site was razed by a courageous and far-thinking Israel; Iraq used WMDs in the war against Iran and on its own restive citizens. Republicans and Democrats alike warned of Iraqi WMDs. The record is littered with statements from acclaimed liberals asserting a WMD program as a reality. The Clinton administration launched massive airstrikes against Iraq primarily to disrupt the development of WMDs. When Saddam kicked UN inspectors out of Iraq, many interpreted the move as an act of defiance as well as a scheme to shield his weapons from discovery. Bush's WMD statements boasted an impressive pedigree.\n \n The war was undertaken with good intentions but in significant aspects was based on bad intelligence. \n \n http://www.timesdispatch.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=RTD%2FMGArticle%2FRTD_BasicArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1137834857685&path=!editorials&s=1045855934983\n \n \n You can't reconsitute those kind of chemical weapons. You scrap them and build new ones. \n\n \n Call it (reconstitute) whatever you want. Again, just prior to the Iraq War, no one was 100% sure that Saddam didn't have the means and the capability to reconstitute chemical and biological weapons in a relatively short time frame. The fact that he had built and used WMD's in previous instances doesn't help your arguments either. \n \n \n Again, stop with the lying.\n\n \n Go tell it to your pet Carp, obvious child. \n \n \n Who said I was a male?\n\n \n Who said you were a grown up, male or female? \n \n \n If Saddam was so religious why did he have thousands of religious leaders imprisoned and horribly executed? Why did he ban numerous Islamic holidays? Why did he ban Sharia? Why did he support broad secular laws despite numerous threats to his life by Sharia supporters? Why was he the target of islamic terrorists on several occasions?\n\n \n Indeed, why do supposed God-fearing Muslims butcher their own Muslim brothers daily? Why is Saddam any different, then?\n \n One more thing for your indigestion:\n \n If Bush was lying, he had a great deal of company, i.e.\n \n \"If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program.\"\n -- President Bill Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998\n \n \"He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983.\"\n -- Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998\n \"Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process.\"\n -- Rep.

Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status.

Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002\n \n \"I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force -- if necessary -- to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security.\" \n -- Sen. John F.

Jay Rockefeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002\n \n \"He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do\" \n -- Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002\n \n \"In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members ... It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons.\" \n -- Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002\n \n \"We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction.\" \n -- Sen.

Republicans hate responsibility and accountability [because of their failures to accept them for their actions]. Do I need to write out even the most obvious thing that anyone with a brain can decipher? \n \n \nSo, Bush lied?\n\n \n I never said he did. To know that Bush lied we would need information that he knew the intelligence was wrong yet willingly went forward with it to deceive the public. We'd need something like Nixon's tapes to prove that. I am arguing that Bush screwed up quite badly and that he pushed information that the CIA red flagged as unreliable. \n \n There was no Saddam-Osama link. And your purposefully ignoring that Osama tried to have Saddam assassinated more then once which led to one of the biggest suppressions of religion in Iraq.\n \n well at least you admit the sources of information were all wrong. And on that note, the inspectors tested the missiles without a payload and full fuel content. Anyone who understands force can tell you what will happen if you try that.\n \n \nNor were they alone in accepting Saddam's WMD program as a fact. Iraq previously had tried to build a nuclear facility with the capability to produce weapons -- until the site was razed by a courageous and far-thinking Israel;\n\n \n That was more then two decades ago.

Republicans and Democrats alike warned of Iraqi WMDs.\n\n \n Republicans and democrats are scum and should both be evicted from the nation. Second, the use of chemical weapons in Iraq and Iran was again at least 11-20 years ago. 1988 was the kurds, so 2006-1988, so almost two decades ago. \n \n \nThe record is littered with statements from acclaimed liberals asserting a WMD program as a reality. The Clinton administration launched massive airstrikes against Iraq primarily to disrupt the development of WMDs. When Saddam kicked UN inspectors out of Iraq, many interpreted the move as an act of defiance as well as a scheme to shield his weapons from discovery. Bush's WMD statements boasted an impressive pedigree.\n\n \n meanwhile you ignore those who understand the middle east. The entire arab world is about image and face. Kicking out the inspectors after they completed a sizable amount of inspections did two things: One to the west couldn't assert they had them and two the rest of the arab would couldn't prove he didn't have them, therefore putting Saddam in a area of image strength. Plus Clinton was wrong, and like Bush, a Scumbag.\n \n Trying to attack me by falsly implying I'm a democrat won't work. They are just as much scum as your party. \n \n \n\n Call it (reconstitute) whatever you want. Again, just prior to the Iraq War, no one was 100% sure that Saddam didn't have the means and the capability to reconstitute chemical and biological weapons in a relatively short time frame. The fact that he had built and used WMD's in previous instances doesn't help your arguments either. \n\n \n And you ignoring that the last time he used them was 18 years ago doesn't help you either. At least you are admitting he didn't have the ability to produce, use, store or move them \n \n \nWho said you were a grown up, male or female? \n\n \n Who said I was even of age? You attacking someone who is not potentially legally old enough to join is just down right sad. You make alot of assumptions that don't pan out. \n \n \nIndeed, why do supposed God-fearing Muslims butcher their own Muslim brothers daily? Why is Saddam any different, then?\n\n \n They do it for non-religious reasons. Doesn't make them any less devout. Last time I checked, those groups were calling for Sharia, something Saddam banned even with threats to his life. You never answered the questions. \n \n \nAnd these are just some of the liberal revisionists who now say Bush lied. How many of them did you support?\n\n \n Again, democrats are scum. Trying to attack me by falsly implying I'm a democrat won't work. They are just as much scum as your party. \n \n \nHypocrites\n\n \n so are you. \n \n Here are the parts you failed to address from my previous posts:\n \n If Saddam was so religious why did he have thousands of religious leaders imprisoned and horribly executed? Why did he ban numerous Islamic holidays? Why did he ban Sharia? Why did he support broad secular laws despite numerous threats to his life by Sharia supporters? Why was he the target of islamic terrorists on several occasions?\n \n The reason you can't address Iraq's military weakness is because not only are you wrong but you lack the maturity to admit it. If I was so wrong you would have refuted my points. Instead you desperate are trying to avoid discussing how Iraq's military was in shambles from desert storm and presented no real threat to largely anyone. That itself rips a giant hole in your fundemental argument and just like Marc9000 it is simply easier to ignore how you are wrong rather then in a adult manner, deal with it. You specifically removed a part of my post (while leaving the rest) for a specific reason: it highlights just why you fail. \n \n First of all the inspectors knew the facilities to build store and move didn't exist. Again, you think you can sell a tangible service or product you have no capacity to make, build, store or move. How I have no idea but I think in rational terms.\n \n Secondly, what I was refering to was your idiotic notion that Iraq's military was a threat to anyone. You've clearly avoided discussing this subject SINCE I ripped your asinine comments to pieces pages back.\n \n How was Iraq a threat to anyone when its neighbors stopped placing significent forces on their borders prior to the war? How was it a threat when it had no navy and no airforce? How was it a threat when it was using technology that most 3rd world forces stopped using years ago? How was it a threat when the armorless Kurds could run the north as their own nation without fear of a Iraqi attack?\n \n You are wrong, at least have the basic human dignity to admit it. Btw, failing to shows you don't have such dignity nor have the maturity the miltiary insitils in its soldiers.\n \n Largely because the US is running around using gun point democracy and Iran was named by Bush as a target and the US doesn't have the will or force to remove Iran's program. If I was a non-democratic nation just cited as a target by the best military in world, I'd be getting nukes ASAP. So really, the adminstration you support is causing your problems. Funny how that works. We don't have a answer to Iran because the adminstration failed to provide or dismissed options. You always keep your options open. That;'s another clear sign you have no history in business\n \n Anyone is business knows that you cannot sell a product or service you cannot produce. You on the other hand think you can. Guess where that leads: Enron. Please, show me how you intend to sell a tangible service or product you have no capacity to make, build, store or move. \n \n So you consider every able bodied person in the from age 18-25 who doesn't join the army to have negelected a very important duty? I'd love to see how you consider that more important given that such a group is quite necessary to running the economy of the nation which allows the army to exist in the first place. But rationality is not part of your thinking process\n \n I'll keep posting that until you deal with it.\n \n The list keeps getting longer.\n \n The more you try to avoid a discussion, the more desperate you become and that's painfully clear to everyone.",

All people deserve unconditional respect. \n\n I think when people speak of \"respect\" in the context of other religions/world views, I think they mostly speak of their respect for the other's right to hold such views, not that the views themselves are respected. I think there are other areas in life where people's rights to private opinions are respected, except in the situation where they infringe on public/human rights. For example, parents' rights are mostly respected in bringing up their children as they wish, as long as those children's rights are not violated. It is a pushy individual that would give unwelcome unsolicited comments about how a particular set of parents should bring up a child, just like it takes a pushy individual to make unwelcome unsolicited comments about the religion a person keeps. \n \n I think most people are comfortable with that stance except when such private beliefs / views start being imposed on the population in general. Then, they no longer are purely private views and become open to attack. However, even then, I think people make an effort mainly to attack the religious arguements used to bring about, say, a new law - not the underlying religious beliefs themselves. \n \n In the ideal world, I agree that all views should be open to criticism. In the real world, there are certain private beliefs that people hold sacred that would cause a lot of conflict if they were openly attacked. I would welcome a debate to open up these questions of religion but I suspect that most people who are strongly religious know that they cannot win an arguement based on logic and evidence but have such a strong attachment to their views that they need to resort to belligerent irrationality when confronted.

For instance, there were Saddam / Al queda links.\n \n Actually, there were many connections, as Stephen Hayes and Thomas Joscelyn, writing in the current issue of the Weekly Standard, spell out under the headline \"The Mother of All Connections.\" Since the fall of Saddam, the U.S. has had extraordinary access to documents of the former Baathist regime, and is still sifting through millions of them. Messrs. Hayes and Joscelyn take some of what is already available, combined with other reports, documentation and details, some from before the overthrow of Saddam, some after. For page after page, they list connections--with names, dates and details such as the longstanding relationship between Osama bin Laden's top deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and Saddam's regime. \n \n Messrs. Hayes and Joscelyn raise, with good reason, the question of why Saddam gave haven to Abdul Rahman Yasin, one of the men who in 1993 helped make the bomb that ripped through the parking garage of the World Trade Center. They detail a contact between Iraqi intelligence and several of the Sept. 11 hijackers in Malaysia, the year before al Qaeda destroyed the twin towers. They recount the intersection of Iraqi and al Qaeda business interests in Sudan, via, among other things, an Oil for Food contract negotiated by Saddam's regime with the al-Shifa facility that President Clinton targeted for a missile attack following the African embassy bombings because of its apparent connection to al Qaeda. And there is plenty more.\n \n http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/cRosett/?id=110006953\n \n Even Hillary Clinton acknowledged the Saddam-Al Qaeda connection in her speech announcing support for the authorization of the use of force against Iraq in 2002. She said, \"In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capabilities, and his nuclear program.

   "Phew.... If anyone can translate / relate that to the current Iraq war I'll address it. But after you translate / relate it, first get electrolyte's concurrence that your translation is accurate. \n \n Electrolyte, you may want to redo that and use plain English as any number of interpretations can be rent trying to figure out what you're actually saying.\n\n Sorry EZ, there's only so much pandering to effective illiteracy I can do. That was my illustration of the original point that you insisted you weren't intelligent enough to understand, and I made special effort to use common examples here especially for you.\n I'll let the reader decide whether EZ is dumb or just playing dumb; either way, he looks pretty bad.\n \n \nHere's another one by electrolyte:\n \n electrolyte: Iraqi citizens don't trust Iraqi troops, so Iraqi troops can't effectively do their jobs. \n \n Response: This is too broad a generalization. Many Iraqi's do trust their own troops. Many others don't, though. Many Americans don't trust our own police and politicians either, so does that mean we've got no shot at democracy either?\n\n So in order to respond, you must not only wait until pages and pages have been posted, but you must remove my statements from context and hope that nobody notices? The above statement (as well as my statement immediately below) explained the reneging on the policy of \"we'll stand down as they stand up.\" We stood up the Iraqi troops, then had to run in and have them stand down.\n \n \nelectrolyte: It has nothing to do with insurgents, and it's not about training and equipping more Iraqi troops.\n \n Response: Since insurgents are bombing and murdering Iraqi's, then yes it does relate. But what's YOUR answer if not training and equipping Iraqi forces to eventually take over? We need YOUR answer here.\n\n See above regarding deliberate (or illiterately, your choice) removing context. Your leading statement is a non-sequitur because the insurgency is not the cause of the problem I was describing.\n Moreover, despite my explanation of how asinine it is for you to pout and whine and demand a solution, you're still demanding a solution...\n \n \nelectrolyte:You're also saying that any idiot knows that situations in wartime are going to change, yet the idiot who happens to be in charge of our armed forces seemed to think that this whole ordeal would be quick and easy with no problems so we could get the troops out quickly. Right.\n \n Response: Early on Bush warned the American people it would not be quick and easy, and that many difficulties lay ahead. Yeah, the initial overthrow went quickly, but I don't recall Bush saying the ensuing political process to democracy and societal control would be a piece of cake. After all, it took America 13 years.\n\n What, do you think you can rewrite history now? Bush and his cronies kept saying that the Iraqis would welcome us and that we'd have a grand time.\n \n \nWould you have cut and run at that time? Probably.\n\n There you go, a personal attack and a strawman rolled into one! Right after I explained to you that you keep committing ad hominems and striking at strawmen. Couldn't have asked for a better response, really.\n \n \n\n electrolyte: \"Left alone,\" we'd have fewer problems. Sure. But last time I checked, we don't get to entirely choose our situations. Throwing out hypotheticals is useless. I can easily say, \"Had we not gone in at all, we wouldn't be in this mess,\" or \"If the Iraqi people trusted the Iraqi forces, we could be bringing troops home,\" but the fact remains that we have gone in and that the Iraqi people do not trust the Iraqi troops, and no amount of wishful thinking is going to change that.\n \n Response: Again, an over-generalization (see above).\n\n No, this was a response to one of your claims that you chose not to reproduce here. That is, you've taken yet another statement out of context; imagine my surprise...\n \n \nIn all this did you propose an alternative solution to the situation we're currently in, and weigh the future ramifications related to such a solution?\n \n This reminds me of a fellow worker once who complained and complained to the boss about certain things that weren't quite right in the workplace. The supervisor told him, \"It's easy to complain. It's harder to come up with a better idea.\"\n \n Where's yours??\n\n What's this? You're again asking for solutions? Is this my lucky day? You're making yourself look much more ridiculous than I ever could.\n \n Keep up the good work!",

The IFGC is commanded by Lt. Gen. Abdul-Qadar.\n \n June 26 - The 9th Iraqi Army Division is certified and assumes responsibility of the battle space of north Baghdad province. Earlier certified divisions are the 6th IA division and the 8th IA division. Also, the 3rd battalion, 1st brigade, 3rd IA division became the third Iraqi battalion to assume responsibility for battle space in western Ninawa province.[20] Three Iraqi divisions, 18 brigades and 69 battalions were in control of battlespace (including two police commando battalions)[21] \n \n July 3 - The 5th Iraqi Army Division is certified and assumes responsibility for the battle space of Diyala province. Also, the IA took control of the maintenance contract for the Numaniyah Regional Support Unit (RSU). The An Numaniyah RSU site was the first of five RSUs to transfer responsibility the Iraqi Army.[22] \n \n August 8 - The 4th Iraqi Army Division is certified and assumes responsibility for most of Salah ad Din, Sulaymaniyah and Tamim provinces, including the major cities Samarra and Tikrit.[23] \n \n September 1 - The 2nd Brigade of the 4th Iraqi Army Division assumed responsibility for the majority of Kirkuk Province. The city of Kirkuk and the village of Hawijah remain under the control of coalition forces.[24] \n \n September 3 - A transfer of responsibility to the Iraqi Joint Headquarters is postponed because there were wording that that needed to be refined in the memorandum of understanding between the coalition and the Iraqi ministry of defense.[25] \n \n September 7 - After 5 days of delays, the transfer of responsibility to the Iraqi Joint Headquarters is finally completed and is hailed by US forces as an important milestone.

He should be supported or opposed exactly to the degree which is warranted by his good conduct or bad conduct, his efficiency or inefficiency in rendering loyal, able, and disinterested service to the Nation as a whole. Therefore it is absolutely necessary that there should be full liberty to tell the truth about his acts, and this means that it is exactly necessary to blame him when he does wrong as to praise him when he does right. Any other attitude in an American citizen is both base and servile. To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public. Nothing but the truth should be spoken about him or any one else. But it is even more important to tell the truth, pleasant or unpleasant, about him than about any one else.\" \n\n Even if we had no response for EZ, we're certainly justified in questioning the actions of the Commander-in-Chief.

I fully understand that we are wonderfully irrational at times. \n \n However, in the cold light of day, with some severe self-examination we know that those ideas are BS. I cannot feel that something as profound, heartfelt and central to one's identity as a religion should be based on delusional thinking or believing in the supernatural. After serious examination, I think a rational person has to face the obvious: god is a fable. Maybe a wonderful fable, but quite simply not real. That's all. \n\n Though my Catholic upbringing is self-imposing guilt for saying this, I would agree that God is most likely a fable. I say \"most likely\" since one cannot disprove the existence of God - just limit His role to exclude those roles which were attributed to Him but which Science has disproven (which seem to include nearly all roles). In that sense, most of the time, I am an agnostic. However, I do occasionally allow myself some self-dillusion or an uncertain leap of faith into some version of Christianity (at least those aspects of Christianity which cannot be directly disproven), mainly because of the emotional sattisfaction it can bring. Religion can give emotionally sattisfying answers to certain life experiences which a purely scientific world view has more difficulty supplying:\n - A loved one dies. It is simply not sufficiently emotionally sattisfying to think that the only thing left of them is their memory. Imagining that they somehow continue on can give one immense peace-of-mind.\n - One is treated very unfairly in a situation where one will never receive justice for that unfair treatment. The idea of a justice in an afterlife is appealing from that point of view.\n - For many people, everyday life can seem so mundane and pointless that an attachment to some noble, spiritual goal can give them the inspiration that their mundane existences do not afford.\n - For others, a belief in a supernatural protector can give them a sense of safety.\n \n These are just a few examples of things that draw people to religion - some of which I have occasionally felt myself. Since I lead a life of relative comfort with access to many activities that can give me a sense of fulfillment, the need for such supernatural beliefs is much less strong than it would be for someone who lives a harsh existence under unjust exploitation with no way to escape. Therefore, most of the time, I feel perfectly comfortable with agnostic beliefs since I rarely feel any emotional need for God to exist. I don't think that is true for most people. If you try to take away the crutch of their belief in God, you would have to replace it with something sufficiently emotionally sattisfying - that is a big challenge.\n \n Besides, I would say that the majority of religious beliefs are quite harmless and are often even beneficial. For example, the morality behind many religions prevent many otherwise violent individuals from acting on their violence. For others, it keeps them from leading lives based purely on selfish pursuits. That is not to say that secular versions of morality cannot achieve the same goals. I simply think that secular versions of morality may not be as effective for some people. Some people may need the threat of supernatural punishment to keep their behavior in line since they would feel free to ignore any intellectual secular arguement.",

   "\"We know nothing, yet believe much\" - Socrates. \n \n Still, all beliefs should be examined indepedent of their origins.\n\n \n I agree with you. We should examine our beliefs. But my point is that humans do not examine their beliefs, they inherit and adopt beliefs without question. To question one's beliefs is to question one's self, one's family, one's society, one's religion and one's nation. Not many are even remotely interested in doing that. \n \n Beliefs are often created in order to justify one's questionable actions. Jews, Christians and Muslims for example could never turn away from their belief that God is on their side, no matter how ridiculous it sounds. Americans believe that they are in a fight of good against evil, and that they are the good ones. No matter how irrational beliefs are, people will do anything to justify them, no matter what the facts are. It's not about being right, it's about winning. \n \n Therefore respecting other's beliefs is what we do when we don't want to hurt anyone's feelings and instead seek to be accepted. To challenge people's beliefs often does not serve self-interest and leads to isolation. Therefore we go along with the party line and adopt and inherit beliefs without question.",

Northern Ireland was divided and still is between Catholics and Protestants.\n\n You are incorrectly assuming that I view religion only as a security blanket or as purely a benign influence. Since Thelmoose had questioned whether any real good could come from self-dillusion, one of my goals in that post was to stress the positive aspects of religious faith, or at least those aspects people could understand or relate to.\n \n The flip side is that there are also negative aspects of religious faith that feed on people's will for power, revenge, or their will for a sense of superiority. There are many examples in Christianity, especially in the Old Testament, where God acts in ways that gives believers emotional sattisfaction for their sense of vengeance or power. Islam, particularly its distortion in the growingly popular extreme versions, seems to be easily distorted to support such needs for vengeance or power. If people did not have these emotional needs, then I highly doubt that such extreme versions of these religions would take hold. Unfortunately, human civilizations are far from perfect and many situations exist which draw people to such needs - where many find such needs fulfilled in this negative aspect of their religious faith. \n \n The civilizations of the Middle East were once far more dominant in the world and have watched themselves fall ever farther backwards in world status until they are now viewed as a somewhat backward corner of the world that only has oil wealth on its side. That is a humiliating position for a civilization to find itself in - especially one that had enjoyed a grand heritage. The people of the Middle East can either blame themselves for this loss or can blame others. Human nature makes it much easier to blame others for ones negative lot in life - especially if there is some real cause which one can exagerate and distort to justify ones claim. Given their world situation, I am not at all surprised that many find a sense of justification in a religion that seems to support their anger. Enveloping that anger in a cloak of religious faith is all the more sattisfying.\n \n I suspect that many of the negative aspects of many religions stem from the fact that they were governed by men of power who wanted to hold onto that power. Even the story about Adam and Eve being rejected from paradise for eating from the tree of knowledge seems, to me, to be a manipulation of believers to try to keep them from thinking for themselves. A population that does not question authority is far more easily controlled and manipulated by their priestly governing class. In contrast, I suspect that religions which did not have a strong religious heirarchy, such as Budhism, are those that have less of the negative aspects which support vengeance or power.\n \n Since this post has mostly concentrated on the negative aspects of certain religions, I wanted to end it by stressing that there are both good and bad aspects to most religions. It is naive or overly simplistic to only see one side. Religions need to be judged by the totality of their beliefs and practices.",

   "Of all the millions of words posted on this forum regarding ones reason to believe in a deity/supernatural or not, this post is an absolute, priceless gem. THANK YOU !\n\n It always pains me to see how discussions about religion have become so polarized lately. I suspect that those people who only see the negative aspects of religion are ones that never have enjoyed any positive religious experiences. On the other side, I suspect that those religious people who do not allow for any questioning of their faith or of the righteousness of their religion are either simply fooling themselves or are afraid of giving any ground in the fear of a slippery slope (\"give an inch, they'll take a mile\"). \n \n I am increasingly thinking that I may have been lucky in that my own religious experience, growing up in a moderately practicing family in Massachusetts, was not a negative one. Never did I hear a \"fire and brimstone\" homily, no arguements against Gays, abortion, or contraception, almost no mention of \"Satan\". Mostly, the readings and homilies concentrated on how to be a better, less selfish, person and how to lead a more spiritual life. My departure from religious practice was based far more on intellectual / scientific arguements than on any emotional reaction against a bad experience. I do not believe that is true for most of the people who argue so vehemently against religion. Given the recent push by the evangelical movements to impose their beliefs on others through political means, I can understand how such negative experiences of religion can give one a lop-sided negative view. I can't deny that these more recent experiences have pushed me farther away from religion as well. However, I think it is important to step back and look at religion objectively - for both its good and its bad aspects.",

   " \n \n\n \n \n At the risk of appearing heartless, I disagree with all of the reasons you assert as benefits of religion. I have been accused at times, by another poster, of wanting to snatch away the last vestige of hope from parents praying for their cancer-riddled child to be allowed to live, and also of wanting to smash an elderly widow's tiny bit of relief against crushing grief by informing her there is no heaven to which her beloved has gone. These straw men arguments aside, I am hoping to articulate this with the understanding that I am truly intending to express compassion and sensitivity to the needs of fellow humans.\n \n I think religion is harmful when it advances the ideas of\n \n 1. A supernatural deity, who is superior to us and whose ways we cannot possibly understand, therefore we can never question. It is the business of that deity to tell us what to do to please him, which we must do unquestioningly or suffer grave consequences. An implication of this is that concern for humanity or oneself is crude and merely self-absorption. \n 2. An afterlife which lasts for eternity and is of superior importance to our earthly existence. \n 3. An ancient book written by an ancient people that purports to communicate the ideas and commands of that deity even when those ideas contravene our understanding of the natural world or when they are utterly anachronistic to our present day existence.\n 4. A morality system based on a set of rule associated with 1, 2 or 3 that do not take into account a different context or the consequences of those rules.\n \n \n I know that life is hard and I am very supportive of nearly anything that can get you through the day. I do appreciate your sense of saying there are others less fortunate than we who might need this religion for support. I also worry that you are being a tad condescending to those people, implying they need this \"primitive\" support, and we of more advances sensibilities can get along without it.\n \n I say there are superior secular alternatives to the purported benefits of religion:\n \n \n\n Religion can give emotionally satisfying answers to certain life experiences which a purely scientific world view has more difficulty supplying:\n - A loved one dies. It is simply not sufficiently emotionally satisfying to think that the only thing left of them is their memory. Imagining that they somehow continue on can give one immense peace-of-mind. \n\n \n This is the toughest. The idea of non-existence is difficult, if not impossible, to grasp. It is therefore natural that probably all people want to believe that an afterlife exists. I have lost dear ones and the idea that they are not HERE is devastating. It is possible to find peace in their memories. The existence of those memories means they are never gone.\n \n I would concede this one except that the afterlife can cause some real problems in the presentlife. If this existence is less important to me now, I can dismiss it because a better day's a-comin'. That's how you can \"promise 'em heaven, and scare 'em with hell,\" and exert a great deal of power over people. That's how some rapturists don't care about our earth now and how a suicide bomber can happily await those 72 babes after exploding himself and a bunch of bystanders to tiny bits.\n \n \n \n One is treated very unfairly in a situation where one will never receive justice for that unfair treatment. The idea of a justice in an afterlife is appealing from that point of view. \n\n \n This is exactly how a downtrodden population gives up hope for making change, for fighting for justice. Are you proposing an acceptance of the status quo for a prize they will never get, but it will be too late to complain about?\n \n \n \n - For many people, everyday life can seem so mundane and pointless that an attachment to some noble, spiritual goal can give them the inspiration that their mundane existences do not afford. \n\n \n Rising above the mundane and pointless is a laudable goal. That doesn't need a deity. My problem is they spend all their time worshipping instead of getting off their butts and improving their lives. All people have to power within themselves to improve their personal existence. I have seen many religious people who are professional worriers and naysayers, but long for their day of glory with the big man. We have the power within ourselves to be happy. \n \n \n \n \n - For others, a belief in a supernatural protector can give them a sense of safety. \n\n \n In that the supernatural protector is non-existent or at least has no bearing on our day-to-day protection, that is what you call a false sense of safety. Can you say tsunami or hurricane? \n \n It wasn't the Lord who saved anyone from death in Katrina, it was the National Weather Service. The Lord was too busy allowing infants to drown in their beds.\n \n \n ...the need for such supernatural beliefs is much less strong than it would be for someone who lives a harsh existence under unjust exploitation with no way to escape. Therefore, most of the time, I feel perfectly comfortable with agnostic beliefs since I rarely feel any emotional need for God to exist. I don't think that is true for most people. If you try to take away the crutch of their belief in God, you would have to replace it with something sufficiently emotionally satisfying - that is a big challenge. \n\n \n I don't think crutches are beneficial, except temporarily until one is healed. Exploitation needs to be fought. Many a dictator specifically counts on a sense of helplessness to maintain control. Many a dictator has used religion for this. \n \n \n \n \n Besides, I would say that the majority of religious beliefs are quite harmless and are often even beneficial. For example, the morality behind many religions prevents many otherwise violent individuals from acting on their violence. For others, it keeps them from leading lives based purely on selfish pursuits. That is not to say that secular versions of morality cannot achieve the same goals. I simply think that secular versions of morality may not be as effective for some people. Some people may need the threat of supernatural punishment to keep their behavior in line since they would feel free to ignore any intellectual secular argument. \n\n \n \n This is the big one. Using a list of sometimes ridiculous rules as a yardstick for morality causes an enormous amount of injustice. Morality based upon what you think is going to offend a deity is just gonna leave some people out. Morality and ethics need to be based upon creating happiness and the alleviation of suffering, not what the Bible said. Religion creates a sense of the \"other\" whose beliefs are inferior and who is not seen in the deity's favor. They are bad and should be at least avoided or at worst destroyed. Religious morality has at one time deemed equality for blacks, women and gays as contrary to the deity's wishes. It is the rigid, dogmatic, absolutist idea of morality that is dangerous and perhaps one of the worst aspects of current deist religion.",

That's how some rapturists don't care about our earth now and how a suicide bomber can happily await those 72 babes after exploding himself and a bunch of bystanders to tiny bits.\n\n \n Several thoughts on this . ..\n \n - First, people who use the afterlife to exert power over people are waaaaay the exception and not the rule in modern religion. This is yet another case of a few in religion being the loudest, and therefore some people getting the impression that the problem is a lot more widespread that it really is.\n \n - Second, in cases where people aren't using the afterlife to exert power over people but simply believe in it as a source of comfort (which happens to be most of the time), one is only partaking in the benefits without the drawbacks. So it seems pretty clear that in cases like this, belief in an afterlife is perfectly fine. It's just not hurting anyone.\n \n Also Thelmoose, since I believe I brought up the example in conversation with you of parents with a terminally ill family member, I wonder if it is me you are referring to with the following statement: \n \"I have been accused at times, by another poster, of wanting to snatch away the last vestige of hope from parents praying for their cancer-riddled child to be allowed to live, and also of wanting to smash an elderly widow's tiny bit of relief against crushing grief by informing her there is no heaven to which her beloved has gone.\"\n \n If it is me you are referring to (and it may not be), let me say for the record that I never accused you of anything. Those were examples of cases where belief in an afterlife played an important role in comfort during very difficult times. If it wasn't me, then I agree with whoever made those comments that they are indeed good such examples (though I would not agree with them accusing you of anything). Such examples are not just hypotheticals, they happen every day to many, many people. One only needs to visit a hospital to see how vital a role religion plays in providing comfort. \n \n And really, it's all moot. Religion simply isn't going away anytime soon. As long as people are dying in this world, religion is going to be a source of comfort, and rightly so. It just seems to me that arguing religion is a bad thing is probably one of the most fruitless endeavors one could possibly partake in. I still say that rather than condemn religion at large, it would be better to condemn the parts of religion that is conclusively a problem (violent and/or controling religion for example, rather than ALL religion).",

Never did I hear a \"fire and brimstone\" homily, no arguements against Gays, abortion, or contraception, almost no mention of \"Satan\". Mostly, the readings and homilies concentrated on how to be a better, less selfish, person and how to lead a more spiritual life. \n\n \n I have had the very same thoughts and experiences. In fact before getting involved in online forums, I really didn't realize there were people out there so hostile toward religion. Yes, I believe hostility IS a accurate descriptor. However, I think some people might very well be justified in feeling that way if religion has hurt them. And to that end, religion needs to fix it's problems. But getting rid of religion altogether is not the answer because it's not going to happen. There will always be religion. \n \n While it sounds like you and I had a similar religious experience growing up, I came to different conclusions than you--rather than departing from religious practice, I chose to continue it even having searched out the intellectual issues you mention. I never really could see how intellectual and scientific arguments invalidated God, and therefore didn't really affect my religion much. As I grew older I did learn about things like evolution, but to me that doesn't really affect fundamental aspects of the Christian faith which are still very much in place with or without evolutionary thinking. \n \n Where religion hurts people, it needs to be fixed. There's no question about that. But I think it's also wrong to portray religion being harmful in cases where it is really not. But I'm glad I've been in contact with people who have been hurt by religion (or are at least very sensitive to it) because it's allowed me to learn and see a POV I wasn't that aware of. And to that end it makes me all the more cautious to be sensitive to how others feel in the way I live out religion toward people.",

   "I think religion is harmful when it advances the ideas of\n \n 1. A supernatural deity, who is superior to us and whose ways we cannot possibly understand, therefore we can never question. It is the business of that deity to tell us what to do to please him, which we must do unquestioningly or suffer grave consequences. An implication of this is that concern for humanity or oneself is crude and merely self-absorption. \n 2. An afterlife which lasts for eternity and is of superior importance to our earthly existence. \n 3. An ancient book written by an ancient people that purports to communicate the ideas and commands of that deity even when those ideas contravene our understanding of the natural world or when they are utterly anachronistic to our present day existence.\n 4. A morality system based on a set of rule associated with 1, 2 or 3 that do not take into account a different context or the consequences of those rules.\n\n I agree that the list which you gave is a daunting one from which I would also like to spare people. However, I don't think that many versions of religion really fully match those criteria. Though some of the more extreme versions of fundamentalist movements may seem to, I can state with absolute confidence that the actual practice of the moderate version of Catholicism that I personally experienced growing up in a liberal state bears very little resemblance to the list which you showed. One can criticize official Catholic dogma but if that dogma does not translate down to the actual practice, then it seems to be purely academic. Like I mentioned in another post, I almost never encountered any of the negative, intolerant or blatantly manipulative aspects of Christianity which you mention. Perhaps I was lucky. If so, then I think that there are also quite a large number of other people whose religious experience was also more moderate. The more recent trend in both Christianity and Islam toward fundamentalism is one that scares me since it does indeed seem to tend toward some of the directions you mention. However, you have to keep in mind that not all versions of Christianity or Islam are fundamentalist.\n \nI know that life is hard and I am very supportive of nearly anything that can get you through the day. I do appreciate your sense of saying there are others less fortunate than we who might need this religion for support. I also worry that you are being a tad condescending to those people, implying they need this \"primitive\" support, and we of more advances sensibilities can get along without it.\n\n Perhaps I am being a bit condescending to some of these folks, but these folks often have various strong pressures or reasons behind religious belief that are less relevant in my situation:\n 1) They may not have any options of actual actions that can get them out of their harsh situations where religion is the only means left for them to cope.\n 2) They may live in a society which exherts strong pressures to follow religion, where those who do not are considered suspect.\n 3) Their access to secular education may be limited, so they may not even understand that there are alternative world views out there.\n \nThis is the toughest. The idea of non-existence is difficult, if not impossible, to grasp. It is therefore natural that probably all people want to believe that an afterlife exists. I have lost dear ones and the idea that they are not HERE is devastating. It is possible to find peace in their memories. The existence of those memories means they are never gone.\n \n I would concede this one except that the afterlife can cause some real problems in the presentlife. If this existence is less important to me now, I can dismiss it because a better day's a-comin'. That's how you can \"promise 'em heaven, and scare 'em with hell,\" and exert a great deal of power over people. That's how some rapturists don't care about our earth now and how a suicide bomber can happily await those 72 babes after exploding himself and a bunch of bystanders to tiny bits.\n\n I agree that there are some people who may use their belief in the afterlife or their belief in predestiny (especially true for many Muslims) to fail to act to improve their lot in the real world. I would agree that this is a negative result that should be discouraged. However, for most people, it is not an either / or situation. Almost every religious person I have encountered finds their life in this world very important and also looks forward to (or fears) the next. I have met almost no-one who doesn't consider this world important. Perhaps your have had other experiences, but that just goes to show that religions vary on this point. Not all beliefs lead one to give up on making efforts in this life. \n \nThis is exactly how a downtrodden population gives up hope for making change, for fighting for justice. Are you proposing an acceptance of the status quo for a prize they will never get, but it will be too late to complain about?\n \n Rising above the mundane and pointless is a laudable goal. That doesn't need a deity. My problem is they spend all their time worshipping instead of getting off their butts and improving their lives. All people have to power within themselves to improve their personal existence. I have seen many religious people who are professional worriers and naysayers, but long for their day of glory with the big man. We have the power within ourselves to be happy. \n\n My response to these is again that religious belief does not necessarily stop people from taking action. Yes, some might, but one cannot paint all religious beliefs with the same brush. In some cases, religion can actually inspire action in this world since people who have otherwise lost courage and hope to change their situation can regain it with religious inspiration. Joan of Arc inspired her people to defeat the oppression of the English. \n \nIn that the supernatural protector is non-existent or at least has no bearing on our day-to-day protection, that is what you call a false sense of safety. Can you say tsunami or hurricane? \n \n It wasn't the Lord who saved anyone from death in Katrina, it was the National Weather Service. The Lord was too busy allowing infants to drown in their beds.\n\n I have to admit that a false sense of safety may mainly do more harm than good, since some people may not take preventive actions in the expectation that God will protect them, and others may blame those who are actually hurt for being hurt due to lack of piety. I will concede that this form of self-dillusion may not often lead to good results.\n \nI don't think crutches are beneficial, except temporarily until one is healed. Exploitation needs to be fought. Many a dictator specifically counts on a sense of helplessness to maintain control. Many a dictator has used religion for this. \n\n There are many situations where people are never healed since the situation that drives them to religion is a permanent one. In that case, the crutch of religion is, by default, one that stays permanently with these people. Some people truly exist in a harsh, exploitative system which they have no reasonable chance of escaping (North Korea comes to mind, or slavery of old). It may be possible for some truly brave and enterprising individuals to find ways of escaping such systems but, statistically speaking, the percentage of such individuals is quite small. The rest have to cope as best they can and religion can often be a crutch that helps them. On a more everyday note, many people whose lives have become a repetitive daily grind do indeed find inspiration in religion. Indeed, it is possible that they might be able to find other means of fulfillment but, for many, religion is the only option which seems to sattisfy their emotional needs.\n \nThis is the big one. Using a list of sometimes ridiculous rules as a yardstick for morality causes an enormous amount of injustice. Morality based upon what you think is going to offend a deity is just gonna leave some people out. Morality and ethics need to be based upon creating happiness and the alleviation of suffering, not what the Bible said. Religion creates a sense of the \"other\" whose beliefs are inferior and who is not seen in the deity's favor. They are bad and should be at least avoided or at worst destroyed. Religious morality has at one time deemed equality for blacks, women and gays as contrary to the deity's wishes. It is the rigid, dogmatic, absolutist idea of morality that is dangerous and perhaps one of the worst aspects of current deist religion.\n\n I certainly agree that there are intolerant aspects of many religions which can cause far more harm than good, and we should all try to oppose such intolerant aspects. Also, most organized religions seem to have some official dogma which doesn't allow for people to stray too far in their beliefs. However, I would make a couple of points :\n 1) Many religions don't seem to enforce or stress such dogmas. Indeed, my personal experience of Catholicism was not one where I encountered any intolerant beliefs.\n 2) Many people do seem to engage in some level of picking and choosing their beliefs from those of established religions - much to the consternation of those who are more fundamentalist or strict. I, personally, hope that that trend continues and opposes the trend toward fundamentalism since it lets people have more control over their beliefs and allows for more critical thinking.\n \n Overall, I suspect that you mainly judge religions based on their worst examples and do not take into account all of the other alternative, less strict or less fundamentalist versions of religion. Given the rising trend in fundamentalism, I can understand why such religious views can skew your view of all religion. I admit that the recent rise in fundamentalism has pushed me farther away from religion as well. However, I think we have to step back to notice that the situation if far more nuanced than we may think. There really ARE both good and bad influences - you just have to know to look beyond the blatantly bad ones.",

My main concern is how one can change those beliefs. Where extremist Islam is concerned, I think that a lot of ruthless behavior has kept moderate Muslims scared into relative silence on these distortions of their religion. Luckily, those of us in the West generally do not face such pressures. It makes me wonder, then, why people of moderate religious beliefs do not speak out more against the extreme views of some fundamentalist sects. Is it a sense of us vs them, where it is a viewed as a fight between the religious and the secular? What is your view?\n \n As for whether science and intellectual arguement can change ones view of religion, it certainly did for me. I view Scientific discoveries and evidence (as long as they are done properly) as the most reliable means to discover truth about our world. Those religious beliefs which I had or occasionally still try to hold have to fit between the cracks of the unknowns or un-disprovable aspects that are still left. However, even then, any tentative leaps of faith I may make into spiritual beliefs are very tentative indeed since I fully realize that those leaps of faith are mainly guesses based on nothing more than the traditions I grew up with and my own personal wishful thinking. The chances of those guesses being right are quite small. When I make such leaps of faith, I do so with the full realization that I may well be deluding myself but that such delusions serve a useful psychological purpose. Doesn't it ever bother you to see how many religious views have been countered by scientific discovery and evidence? Otherwise, do you also not adhere to any specific dogma and have a more flexible view of spirituality and the supernatural?",

Indeed, as you say, many, if not most, specific Catholic Church practices do oppose divorce or gays or many women's rights. I personally oppose such dogma and, knowing a number of the people who had attended the same church as I had, can be quite sure that I was far from alone in those views. I have since largely left religious practice and only divert to it on fairly rare occasions, so I am largely an outsider. However, the great majority of insiders (i.e. practicing religious people) I have met do not staunchly follow dogma but have their own beliefs which seem to selectively choose from within that dogma, or reinterpret it.\n \n That brings up an interesting issue. Namely, how far can people stray from religious dogma and still consider themselves part of that religion? I think that if you set a strict definition that anyone considering themselves Catholic needs to believe in 100% of the official dogma, then that would only apply to a small fraction of the Catholics.

   "You seem to be implying this already, but those unprovable scientific phenomena are not leaps of faith by any means. They were postulated based on observable evidence and their existence continues to be confirmed by same. Unprovable does not mean irrational. \n\n I think we all agree that a strength of a hypothesis is based on the evidence for that hypothesis - which includes the evidence which led to that hypothesis being proposed and its consistency with the existing evidence. Unsupported hypotheses usually get very little attention unless and until they gain some supporting evidence. Sometimes, scientific hypotheses are proposed that are out in left field and are looked at with tremendous skepticism. Sometimes they are right, sometimes they are wrong. The hypothesis of a supernatural would otherwise be considered one that is WAY out there and which would gain no respect unless there was some evidence - which there isn't. \n \n All this means that I agree that religious faith certainly does not scrutinize itself in the same way as scientific analysis does, which means that there is a tremendous probability that they are all fooling themselves. Some may realize that they are nearly certainly fooling themselves, others may avoid thinking about that aspect in order to feel more comfortable in their beliefs. For many, as long as their beliefs are not directly disproven, they feel comfortable keeping them. I think that anyone who claims certainty in their religious beliefs is either fooling themselves or might have experienced some experience of the imagination that falsely convinces them of the existence of the supernatural. No, it is not a rational approach but it is one that many people take because of emotional needs. Once the assumptions are made, they might use their rationality to explore the consequences of those supernatural assumptions, but I agree that the original assumptions are not made based on rational analysis. This does not mean they are useless or necessarily harmful.\n \nAn argument here seems to be: What is wrong with religious belief if it causes no harm and people are comforted by it? \n Here is what is wrong with that belief:\n \n 1. It causes at least some harm. (I think gobs of it.)\n 2. It isn't true. There is no god or heaven or hell and the bible is mostly fables. The ideas are a lie. It is not OK to encourage belief in things that cannot possibly be true. It is magical thinking. It is irrational. We are discouraging the use of a skill our wonderful brains afford us - critical thinking - which is an essential survival tool.\n\n I did not say that all religions or all aspects of a particular religion cause no harm. I have presented the negative aspects of religion in enough posts that I would hope that you would recognize that. My claim, however, is more \"Why would we need to irradicate as well those particular aspectsof religious belief if they cause no harm and people are comforted or positively inspired by them?\" I think you would agree that there are some aspects of religious belief that cause no harm. Of course, there are many aspects which do cause harm but I would be surprised if you think that ALL aspects cause harm. My concern is that we do not \"throw the baby out with the bathwater\". I would only throw out the \"bathwater\".\n \n As for your point 2, this is trickier since it depends on what aspects of human existence one values. From the point of view of the search for the truth about our reality, I would agree that tolerating irrational views is counterproductive. I would disagree, though, that people who are religious do not engage in any critical or rational thinking. They may not practice the critical or rational thinking when it comes to their original assumption about the supernatural. However, once those assumptions are made, then many do seem to use rational or critical thinking about the logical consequences of those assumptions. I agree that many seem to use no critical thinking, but that ignores all of those that do. Overall, I would say that they are certainly not using any critical or rational thinking CONSISTENTLY. That lack of consistency is what leads them to false paths.\n \n If the search for the truth about our reality was the only goal worthy of humanity, then I would agree that irrational views should be purged. However, since humans are also emotional creatures, there are limitations to our actions and thoughts which are imposed by emotion, where religion or other idealized non-suported idealistic notions provide certain solutions. I am not convinced that a purely rational, scientific world view would be always more effective than a religious one since we are not purely rational creatures but emotional ones as well. The development of various religions has been shaped very much by human emotional needs in a way that science has not. It all depends on the goals you are setting for humanity.\n \n For some goals, Science certainly has shown itself to be by far superior - ex. knowledge that can benefit humanity in new inventions and discoveries, etc. Critical analytic thinking that is stressed most highly and consistently in the scientific world view is also a highly beneficial aspect of humanity. That is not to say that there is no critical thinking in religion, just that it is not consistent and therefore much less disciplined. Indeed, some religious beliefs stand firmly in the way of critical thinking.\n \n However, Science does a much poorer job in inspiring people to acts of self-sacrifice or non-selfish pursuits. A scientific world view is also emotionally much less sattisfying to many people. Self-dillusion does have its benefits.\n \n [By the way, I hope you don't mind the seeming long-windedness in many of my posts. I simply often find it hard to give short, simple answers to complex issues. There are often many caviats and subtleties involved.]",

It is only in the area of religion that we hold tightly to them. You said that one can make irrational assumptions and then think critically given those assumptions. That is utterly incorrect. Garbage in, garbage out. A thesis is only as good as its base assumptions.\n\n There were many great scholars of old (St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, etc.) that had no access to scientific analysis (since it had not yet thoroughly developed) but which took the assumed knowledge of their day (i.e. religious assumptions) and logically thought out the consequences. They were rational, logical and critical in their analysis. They just happened to be wrong since their original assumptions were wrong. The difference between the great scholars of the past and religious scholars of today is that modern religious scholars do indeed have access to scientific data but generally choose to either ignore it or misrepresent it. In purposefully ignoring or misrepresenting the discoveries of Science, they are acting generally irrationally. However, I hold to my view that one can have a logical, rational progression from a wrong assumption. It is true that wrong original assumptions generally lead to wrong conclusions (i.e. your \"garbage in, garbage out\"), but that does not mean that the path in between was not followed rationally or critically. I am sure there were many scientific hypotheses that were proposed and then logically developed which turned out to be wrong. Granted, most scientists are very careful what they hypothesize, but there are enough that are not, so all of their subsequent logical analysis is in vain. The advantage of the scientific method is that those are eventually weeded out. Since most religions will never admit that their core assumptions are wrong, there is no self-regulating mechanism as there is in Science. \n \nEmotions are not outside the purview of rationality. And I never said we have to be rational all the time. Art is often admittedly and wonderfully irrational, but it never poses as rational. It is the revelry in the irrational that makes it so fun.

Why should irrationality be a better modus operandi in religion? \n\n I am also annoyed when religious people claim to be fully rational in their beliefs - including their assumption of rationality about their leaps of faith. They often either misrepresent the Scientific discoveries that challenge their beliefs or avoid the discussion all together. There are some who only hold those beliefs that Science cannot directly disprove but even those believers need to aknowledge that their leap of faith is arbitrary - based only on tradition and wishful thinking - and has little chance of being right.\n \nHave you never heard of the social sciences? of philosophy, ethics? These are all based on rationality and do quite well in serving the needs of humans. No where do you need to believe in mythical beings and fables as fact. \n\n I think that these are effective only to a point or only within a certain range of people open to purely intellectual arguements. Perhaps it is condescending on my part, but I think that some people may need that reward and punishment that is supplied by religious belief in order to direct their behavior. Depending on the particular religion or aspect of religion, this can be used for good or for bad. For example, the comfort of the thought that one will continue on in an afterlife can give courage to those who would otherwise have great fear of a death leading to non-existence. Some may use that added courage to, say, fight a tyrant. Others might use it for suicide bombing of innocent civilians. That all depends on the particular religion and situation.\n \n I agree that purely rational, secular philosophies and ethics can work for a great number of people. However, not all will be as inspired by these secular views as they would be by religious views and I suspect that secular views would have a much harder time convincing someone to forfeit their lives for a cause, or to prevent an otherwise ruthless individual from causing harm to others.

I'm not trying to derail the discussion; I'm quoting this only as supporting evidence of how faith-based organisations have few qualms about demonising those who disagree with them. Do you think that website was genuinely being inundated with emails saying \"I'm angry because you're teaching children to value human life\"? Of course not, but the message is clear: that's the alternative to believing in Jesus.\n \n Even self-professed moderates like jyoshu retain a degree of unwarranted distaste for 'cold reason'. Why? Can only a lie give comfort? \n \n As a perfectly happy atheist I live in awe of the splendid complexity of our evolved world. To me the knowledge that our existence - and appreciation of it - can arise from the aeons-long interaction of a handful of simple, insensate rules is profoundly moving, and it strikes me that the best way to honour the laws that make us possible is to understand them. By comparison the superstitious notion that we were all sculpted out of mud by a 'big thing just like us' in the sky - however refined to our modern intellectual palate the expression of that notion becomes - is tragically mean; small; fatuous. We're here, and there's only us to know it; let's not waste our time inventing new apron-strings to cling to.\n\n I have no doubt that there are many corruptions in religion that have crept in through ages of priests trying to cling to their power by distorting the alternative world views. Just because I am arguing that there are good aspects to religion as well as bad aspects does not mean that I am naive about religion. I simply try to paint the more nuanced picture that I see. I don't believe that oversimplifying the picture is productive - it just causes un-necessary strife (as opposed to the actually necessary strife). I have to admit that, as a moderate, I often find myself arguing against both sides, both of which often assume that any deviation from their view means that I must be on the other side. Please understand that there are views in between that one can take.\n \n As for whether or not one can balance the objective analytical thinking of science with the emotional appeal of religion, I have met plenty of people who are trying. Their effort may be clumsy and disorganized since there seems to be no organized religion that fully suports them in those efforts, but these are efforts that are being made by large numbers of people. The reference that Thelmoose gave quotes that 55% of Americans believe that God created humans in the present form (admittedly, a scary number), 13% believe that humans evolved without any intervention from God. The number which is significant for my arguement here is that 27% of Americans believe that humans evolved but God guided the process. What this says to me is that they are trying resolve their trust in Science with their trust in religion. This tells me that a large number of believers do not blindly follow the official line. Reference: http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/11/22/opinion/polls/main657083.shtml\n \n I agree with you that one need not have a ficticious world view to appreciate the beauty of our physical world. Secular world views can be just as emotionally sattisfying in a very wide range of areas. However, I think that there are some areas where religious world views do offer more emotionally sattisfying answers - such as those I presented in another post: the comfort of thinking of a dead loved on as somehow continuing, the sense of closure one can get with the thought that someone who has harmed you and gotten away with it will get justice in an afterlife, the courage one can gain in facing death (ex. battling a tyrant) when one thinks that one is not facing non-existence but a potentially wonderful afterlife. Yes, these may be delusions, but they are often quite useful delusions.",

For instance, there's no sound reason than someone should, for the sheer love of art and expression, paint, build sculpture, or engage in other art.

Or even where everything had to be put through some sort of \"filter\" of reason.\n \n To criticize religion because some people view it as an alternative to scientific discovery just isn't a fair outlook because it doesn't take into account those who DON'T view it that way, and the personal comfort and satisfaction it provides. It seems the crux of your argument against religion is that it is sometimes used as an alternative against science. That's a valid concern, but it's also a generalization to throw out the baby with the bathwater and condemn ALL religion as a result.

Let's slow down for a second. Did you see that? I did. It was very subtle. See, you've now switched from criticizing the broader general concept (religion) to problems that sometimes take place within a given religion rather than all religion. We're right back where we started--these are problems that may indeed be problems, but it's irrational for you to criticize all of religion and general religious thinking because of that. I agree with you about these specific problems--sometimes religion can get exclusive. But to consider that a problem with the general concept of religion is irrationally generalizing. Not to mention that it gets into a slippery slope. What you're describing here doesn't describe all of religion. This is VERY important. Nor is it a given that what you are describing going to happen with a given case of religion. Heck, some religions aren't even that concerned with eternal life at all, and some that do would take a universalist view. Your idea, as evidenced by your statements just now, that comfort about the afterlife doesn't happen in religion without giving conditions for going to that afterlife is just flat-out not true. The most you can rightfully condemn is that those conditions exist in some cases within religion.\n \n \n3. I may not believe in heaven, but nor do I fear hell, for me or my loved ones. Nor need any rational loved-one of mine fear hell for me.\n\n \n Absolutely. Nothing wrong with that.\n \n \n4.

See, that's the thing. People enjoy religion. Maybe, just maybe, they enjoy the singing, the emotions that come out of it, the community they experience, the reminders of moral living, etc. You know, all those things that make up such a non-rational system. And sure, you would be right in saying they could get that from non-religious sources too. But so what? Maybe they just flat-out prefer the religious ones. It's ok.

God seems to be more of a hypothesis unsupported by existing evidence but also not fully disproven by existing evidence. There are certainly roles and actions that have been claimed for God that have been disproven by Science - ex. that he created man in his present form, that he created the universe in six days, etc. - but that does not prove that he does not exist. Even unsupported hypotheses have SOME chance of being right, however small.\n \n Just because a hypothesis has no support in evidence does not mean that it has to be wrong. In medieval times, there was absolutely no evidence about the Big Bang that people had access to. If someone had guessed about that hypothesis, they would have been utterly ridiculed - even among great open-minded intellectual thinkers - since it would have seemed completely random and irrational. However, the chance that anyone would have guessed about the hypothesis of the Big Bang correctly would have been miniscule in those times. Apparently no one had guessed correctly then.\n \n The Big Bang almost certainly exists and does so despite the fact that no humans recognized that during medieval times (they had no faith in an unsupported hypothesis since no one had guessed that hypothesis). Similarly, God or the supernatural may or may not exist whether or not people recognize that - i.e. whether they have faith.

In the absence of evidence that a postulated entity exists, the default assumption is that it does not.\n\n \n But the over-riding consensus in the world in this case is by far NOT atheism,* therefore most believe in the possibility of a deity. It is reasonable to assume that some of those people apparently feel the evidence suggests God exists, evidence like the existence of the universe and it's beginnings, for example. So the issue isn't whether there IS evidence of God, but rather how the existing evidence is to be interpreted. The same things that the believer says proves God (the universe--design) are the things the atheist says disproves God. And vice-versa.

   "That we should condemn when religion obstructs science, rather than ALL religion? (come on . . . you can do it! Really!)\n\n \n But jyoshu, that's what I already do. We only differ in our appreciation of the source of that obstruction. \n \n You see and wish to tackle the symptoms: creationism, mysogyny, the abomination that is violent martyrdom. I observe that these symptoms arise from the reading of holy texts and are propagated against all reason through the minds of those taught that religious thinking - faith - is a virtue. \n \n When I ask what benefit we are gaining to make these things worth preserving - worth teaching to yet another generation - the best you can come up with is that provided the recipient of these teachings is educated and worldly enough to interpret the texts 'correctly', and positions his mental god-wall 'correctly', no harm is done.\n \n When pressed to identify the 'correct' location for a god-wall, you first suggest it should be where science cannot reach anyway (rendering the wall itself redundant) and then demonstrate that your 'correctly' positioned god-wall is nowhere of the sort; rather it prevents you from drawing logical conclusions from paradox and blinds you to the worrying use of violent metaphor (if one even accepts your protestations to that effect) in the indoctrination of young children.\n \n \nI see no reason to not apply the same standards you do of art to religion.\n\n \n \nBy no means do I think you are rationally cold and calculating toward art, Peeling. Or music. And I certainly didn't mean to give anyone the impression you were. But religion? yeah, you are. It's a double standard.\n\n \n It would be a double standard if they were in any way similar concepts. What a thoroughly bizarre direction your argument has taken! Why didn't you pull me up for not condemning irrational numbers while you were at it?\n \n Seriously, though, your point needs answering in detail if only to de-mud the waters.\n \n The appreciation of art is a faculty and is not irrational, even if my hasty outline above is only part of the truth. It may serve no obvious purpose - it may even be a genuine by-product and serve no actual purpose, but that does not make it irrational or require irrationality on the part of the creator or beholder. Nor does art or the appreciation thereof make any statements about how best we should arrive at understanding. \n \n As an aside, where art is deliberately harmful, it is invariably harmful in the service of unshakeable belief. Hmm... you've just given me an excellent idea about how to eliminate harmful art...\n \n Religion, on the other hand, is a philosophical attitude: the elevation of irrationality as a virtue; it preaches the supremacy of faith over reason as a means of establishing the truth. There is no double standard in distinguishing between a (fun but possibly useless) faculty and a philosophical attitude.\n \n \nSee, you've now switched from criticizing the broader general concept (religion) to problems that sometimes take place within a given religion rather than all religion.\n\n \n No, jyoshu, I haven't switched. I'm giving examples of the sort of useless or harmful beliefs religion shelters and propagates, which would not survive in a population of truly open minds.\n \n It is as if I am criticizing a disease, and whenever I point to the symptoms that arise from it as justification for my criticism, you get all excited and say I'm really criticizing the symptoms and we should deal with them.\n \n Besides, if it's irrational for me to criticize religion for the nonsense it often packs in along with its feel-good message about life after death, then, my friend, it's equally irrational for you to defend religion based on a few allegedly useful features some of its variations happen to contain.  \n \n If I must restrict myself to the purely philosophical grounds for rejecting religion, then surely the same goes for you. Where, then, is your argument in support of faith being a better way of establishing truth?\n \n \nBut maybe they don't want to. See, that's the thing. People enjoy religion. Maybe, just maybe, they enjoy the singing, the emotions that come out of it, the community they experience, the reminders of moral living, etc. You know, all those things that make up such a non-rational system.\n \n \n Here we go again, conflating the lack of obvious purpose with irrationality, and slyly painting me as the dour, joyless stick-in-the-mud. That people enjoy singing, a sense of togetherness etc etc is not irrational, in that if we look, we find an explanation. \n \n \nAnd sure, you would be right in saying they could get that from non-religious sources too. But so what? Maybe they just flat-out prefer the religious ones.\n\n \n Or perhaps, like the promise of life after death, the satisfaction of basic human needs are just another way particular incarnations of religion attract and retain followers, and you don't really need to hold unshakeable, silly beliefs to enjoy yourself. Christianity provides a particularly pertinent example at this juncture.\n \n Consider for a moment just how many of the experiences vital to a happy human existence christianity teaches are sinful outside the confines of the religion. Sex? Nope, sinful unless it's with your wedded partner. Singing and dancing with other people and staying up late? Frowned upon unless it happens inside church with proper hymns. Life after death? Great if you're a good christian, not so great otherwise. Losing your inhibitions and temporarily making the world feel a softer, cuddlier place? Fine so long as the endorphins you're tripping on come from a 'religious experience' (read: transports of tribal hysteria) and not from a bottle or a joint.\n \n Christianity has famously gone out of its way to pinpoint and co-opt as many of the things that make life enjoyable as it can, systematically branding as sinful any alternative methods of obtaining that enjoyment.

No: the orbit of the planets was - before anyone came up with a way of measuring them - once judged a philosophical exercise, as was their composition and that of the stars, which one person went so far as to say we would never by any means be able to determine.\n \n Have you judged correctly now? It would seem not; your beliefs are - to a lesser degree than many, admittedly - still somewhat at odds with observation and logical deduction. Equally respectfully, who are you to say whether you have partitioned the knowable from the unknowable correctly? Isn't it better to leave everything on the table and proceed with open minds, than risk labouring for - as has happened in the past - centuries under crippling misconceptions? Misconceptions that threaten to deny us medical treatments and cost lives, such as those a substantial fraction of Americans are once again falling prey to?\n \n Secondly, you fail to provide any justification for protecting as sacred those beliefs we do currently perceive as undisprovable. You say it's harmless - but by your own definition it's also unnecessary. On the other hand, teaching people that such an attitude is virtuous inevitably leads in some cases to harmful beliefs being installed behind the same inviolable walls. Not only could that not happen if the wall were not there, but the holders of such ideas would find far less fertile soil in the minds around them.\n \n This is where I cannot fathom your reasoning. You define your 'correct' god-wall as something that serves no purpose whatsoever, yet when I suggest we should knock it down to avoid the inevitable attendant problems, you defend it on the grounds that it's 'sometimes harmless'. When it's harmless, it's also useless; if it actually achieves something, it's harmful. I just can't conceive of why you would insist it's such a good idea!",

   "To go on certain presumptions is not a logical fallacy. Logic is a process. One must always start with assumptions that cannot be proven where certain things are considered. Spiritual issues for one. The origins of the universe for another.\n\n \n A couple of points here:\n \n 1)Assumptions are made to be tested.\n \n Assuming A and from it proving B is futile if the truth of A cannot be determined. Rather, one would say 'I assume NOT(A), from it derive C, observe C to be false or contradictory, and conclude that my assumptions were flawed.' Armed with the knowledge that A is true, one could then safely derive B.\n \n You can assume whatever you like, but it is the acid test against reality that gives those assumptions value. \n \n Theistic givens, on the other hand, are not subjected to such rigour. When impossible conclusions are reached, excuses are made rather than the givens being re-examined. This is usually justified by declaring them 'a matter of faith' or 'beyond the reach of reason'. \n \n Even if true, this implies such beliefs have no value in rational argument. It is clearly impossible for you to start from a point upon which we both agree, and through reason convince me of the correctness of beliefs that reason cannot touch. It is equally impossible, therefore, for you to start with your beliefs and, through logic, derive conclusions with any confidence of their correlation with reality. The whole exercise is pointless.\n \n 2) Why 'must' we make these assumptions?\n \n You say that when considering spiritual matters we must make certain assumptions. But why must we even consider spiritual matters? Why is it even sensible to ask \"Science is great for the real stuff, but what about the things that aren't real?\" \n \n What does hope taste like? What colour is sound? How high is orange? Must these questions have answers, just because we can ask them?\n \n If you want to know what it's like for me, when I hear someone ask 'but what about the spiritual, supernatural side of things?', imagine I ask you:\n \n \"Ok, but what about all the stuff that isn't real or supernatural? Hmm?\"\n \n If you're about to retort, \"don't be silly, the real and supernatural encompass everything that exists,\" reflect for a moment on the meaning of 'exists'.\n \n \nWhile the secular humanist might say there is no evidence to point to a god or that there is less evidence to point to a god, it is only because they begin with the assumption that God does not exist. You wind up in a catch 22 no matter which direction you approach it.\n\n \n Two points here:\n \n First, do you assume there is no elephant in your bedroom?\n \n Discounting the possibility you really do keep one there, the correct answer is 'yes, but only since you asked me the question.' Likewise, claiming that I 'assume' there is no god only means anything at all because someone has first suggested that there is or might be such a thing. Were you sitting there a couple of minutes ago, convinced there was no elephant in your bedroom? Were you prejudiced to that effect?\n \n This is why the burden of proof always lies on the proponents of an idea or entity. I don't need to 'assume' there is no god, I merely remain unconvinced by your (and anyone elses) suggestion that such an entity exists. The reverse argument, which I recall EZ using in the past (\"I don't need to 'assume' there is a god, I merely remain unconvinced by your suggestion that such an entity doesn't exist\") is invalid because while it's perfectly possible not to believe in something simply because you've never even considered the possibility, it is impossible to believe in something without having considered the possibility.\n \n Secondly, as I pointed out above, one may assume anything, but assumptions are not the foundation of logic, they are what we use logic to test.\n \n \nThere's no other explantion other than prejudice when someone views an entire system and way of life as bad when it's not,\n\n \n It's your choice to see criticism of faith as criticism of your 'entire system and way of life'. I wouldn't dream of criticising you for going to church, donating money to charity, singing (well, I'd have to actually hear you I suppose, to be sure, but then I'm no songbird either). All I criticise you for is defending and advocating the teaching of faith.\n \n \nand particularly in cases where peoples' faith isn't truly harming them anyway.\n\n \n We've been through all this. Unshakeable beliefs do cause harm - and when they don't, they don't need to be unshakeable anyway. \n \n \nGood things do come out of religion.\n\n \n Good things are done by people who also happen to be religious, you mean.\n \n \nYou tried to move the goalposts in our last discussion by suddenly shifting to the \"faith\" only aspects of religion,\n\n \n I wish I could find a 'my previous posts' page on this site, because one of the very first messages I ever posted here stated the problem with religion was that it taught the belief that belief is good.",

I believe the stuff I deleted did not include things directed to me.\n \n Since you are asking many questions of me, I will come at it from a different tac. I think you will find that it appropriately addresses your concerns.\n \n All considerations are based on some assumptions. If one goes back far enough one comes to assumptions that have no proof, nor any real evidence even other than some perceptive effects.\n \n For example consider mathematics, in particular geometry. We discuss the existence of space, but what is space made of? Mathematically speaking, space is defined by the presence of a plane and a point not in the plane. Very well, what is a plane? A plane is defined as a line and a point not in the line. But what is a line? A line is the set of all points that fulfills the equation of the form y=mx+b. It is composed of an infinite number of points but at least two of them. What is a point? A point is the presumptive location of space of zero demensions. It is presumed. There is no proof of its existence. It is the assumption upon which all geometry is based. A postulate if you will.\n \n One can certainly discuss physical laws. How about thermodynamics. or motion. Lets consider Inertia for example. Inertia is the inherent tendency of a body to remain at its current state of motion unless acted on by an outside force. The question is why did the object become in motion in the first place? Because it was initially at rest and an outside force acted on it? Where did the outside force come from. It was a part of the initial explosion that created the universe? What was a part of that etc etc.\n \n You see my point. Even science must make some initial assumptions if you go back far enough. The nature of how things are is one of those assumptions. Atheists assume there is no god, because they do not see the evidence supporting the existence of God as substantial or real. It does not mean there is no evidence, it merely means that we differ on the conclusions both of which can be supported logically.\n \n Such as where did the universe come from. It did not come from anywhere it is/was self existent. Science actually contradicts that. It came from the big bang. Okay, go back further, it came into existence on its own from nothing. Possibly. I cannot say and there is no way to conclude that one way or the other.\n \n God is self existent. Science does not support this. But Science cannot prove that God is not. It is as equally probable that God created the universe and exists as it was that the universe just happened.\n \n They both (the possibility of God or no God) have to come into reasoning discussions where the discussion centers on the nature of reality. Reasoning people have always reasoned way beyond themselves. Since we are finite, it is necessary for us to imagine the infinite in order to process reality. Infinity is a part of reality regardless of whether or not you posit a God. They are basic assumptions. People start somewhere. I cannot prove the existence of God. But there are certainly a lot of logical questions that get answered with His existence. One of the reasons I choose to believe in God is that the answers that are afforded me through that belief comport more completely with my experience of reality. Some I do not understand still, but more that I understand than I don't and more that I understand if God does not exist.\n \n EF",

   "I am only going to answer the part concerning me. I believe the stuff I deleted did not include things directed to me.\n\n \n Correct. Sorry; haven't quite got the hang of this 'quote' thingy :)\n \n \nAll considerations are based on some assumptions. If one goes back far enough one comes to assumptions that have no proof, nor any real evidence even other than some perceptive effects.\n \n For example consider mathematics, in particular geometry. <snipped description< It is the assumption upon which all geometry is based.\n\n \n Geometry is a poor example for your purposes, because the axioms of geometry are not assumptions about reality. We define geometric space ; we do not describe it. The link with reality is merely to say that if the behaviour of entities within the space we define closely mirrors the observed behaviour of entities in reality, our geometry is judged to be a good model.\n \n \nSuch as where did the universe come from. It did not come from anywhere it is/was self existent. Science actually contradicts that. It came from the big bang. Okay, go back further, it came into existence on its own from nothing. Possibly. I cannot say and there is no way to conclude that one way or the other.\n \n God is self existent. Science does not support this. But Science cannot prove that God is not. It is as equally probable that God created the universe and exists as it was that the universe just happened.\n\n \n Therein lies your pivotal logical fallacy: that something being unprovable or undisprovable implies the equal likelihood of either possibility. This is demonstrably not the case, and you yourself never behave as if it is except in the special case of your god.\n \n Moreover, it is untrue to say that science cannot and has not touched god. \n \n When I observe that the biblical stories of creation cannot possibly be true, I cease to view them as evidence of anything. An analogy: someone approaches you and tells you a bearded dwarf in pink pyjamas just stole your car. You rush off, only to find that your car has in fact been towed for being illegally parked. Should you continue to believe in the dwarf? Must there have been a dwarf involved somewhere? Was stealing just a metaphor?\n \n Clearly, your continued belief in the diminutive cross-dressing somnambulist would be eccentric to say the least. He is not needed to explain events, just as a christian god who cares about humanity, determines morality, listens to prayers, and sends us to heaven or hell is not required to explain the universe we see around us.\n \n The god of the big bang is a contemporary invention induced by science, which had quite neatly dispatched his predecessor. I have no doubt that as science continues to teach us about how the universe behaves, those determined to remain religious will invent ever more obscure and hidden versions of god to fill the narrowing gaps. Either that or simply deny what science is showing them, and fight to have superstition reinstated as fact.\n \n \nPeople start somewhere. I cannot prove the existence of God. But there are certainly a lot of logical questions that get answered with His existence. One of the reasons I choose to believe in God is that the answers that are afforded me through that belief comport more completely with my experience of reality. Some I do not understand still, but more that I understand than I don't and more that I understand if God does not exist.\n\n \n You will find no argument from me in your assessment of religion: the preference to believe a made-up 'explanation' right now than admit ignorance and seek truth that might be centuries in the uncovering.\n \n The existence of god would not explain anything; in particular it does not explain why or how he came to be. You can say he is 'self-existent' and pretend that's an answer, but it really isn't. \n \n So why does it feel like it is?\n \n The answer is touchingly simple: it feels like an answer because you're offloading the responsibility of ultimate understanding onto a father figure. The idea we tend to like is the one we've already experienced and been comforted by in our childhood: a father who was there before we were born, looks after us, and knows everything. Take our parents out of the picture and the world can seem a scary place. It's inevitable that the fantasy of a really big dad who really does know everything would rise to prominence.\n \n Think about it: would a self-existent machine that made the universe 'explain' everything? No; we would endeavour to understand the nature of its self-existence. It is only god-as-a-father-figure that makes it ok to stop asking questions; makes it ok for us to be incapable of understanding.\n \n \nIs it really so hard to actually refer to religious beliefs as those beliefs are professed rather than in a way that maximizes the \"gotta-make-it-look-silly\" effect?\n\n \n One could equally ask, \"Is it really so hard to refer to atheism, evolution and so forth as they are professed, rather than in a way that maximises their immorality or (especially in the case of evolution) the 'gotta make it look silly' effect?\"\n \n I think what we should take away from this is that it is always necessary to misrepresent rational beliefs in order to make them sound silly. Irrational beliefs sound silly all on their own; it is the fact that they exist in your personal blind-spot in a sea of equally silly ideas that makes accurate analogies offensive. It is your personal choice to 'deeply hold' these beliefs and to take offence if they are questioned or cast in an unflattering light. \n \n Late edit: What I have argued all along is that teaching people that religious beliefs should be held 'deeply personally' is the root of the problem. \n \n That said, you are correct in pointing out that highlighting the silliness of religious beliefs is often unproductive. I confess, myself, that I find it hard to argue against a belief deliberately contrived to be undisprovable - refashioned over the centuries, indeed, to dodge science's ever-increasing hail of bullets - without at some stage pointing out that what you are doing is, basically, silly.

These beliefs developed over time in most cases, and you'll find that many of them are not held by all religious people. And keep in mind that religion HAS allowed science to change it where it becomes necessary, so with all due respect here I don't think you're being quite fair. Again, the copernican idea of the universe comes up as an example, as well as the fact that theistic evolution is a growing movement in Christianity. But where it is not necessary, there's no point in religion doing so and there are many religious tenets of which it is simply not necessary.\n \n But regarding the portraying-it-in-a-silly-light matter, my point was simply that showing respect toward someone's view is simply a matter of courtesy; it's the flies and the honey/vinegar effect.

You certainly don't have to show respect and you are more that free to continue to portray religious beliefs in a way that you know full well will be offensive to religious people. But it only hurts your arguments rather than helps them, because it turns religious people off to you and your message. Remember my illustration of the funeral urn on the mantle? Ticking people off tends to be counter-productive; it's that simple. So it's really irrelevant that you feel religion is silly and therefore seek to portray it as such.

   "From my own experience, I disagree with your last sentence and know it to be untrue--which is the heart of this. It is not crafted to fit with my rational understanding of the world; in exists independent of that. That's the whole point of faith: to be other than the rational--the explainable--the observable.\n\n \n The scope of that which remains unexplained and unobserved is dictated by science, not religion. How can you honestly 'know this to be untrue'?\n \n In the past, were not more things unexplained and unobserved, and were not these too, then, part of faith? The sun rose because god willed it so, or because a scarab beetle pushed it. As science has expanded the reach of our knowledge and reason, so religion has been endlessly redesigned to fit the gaps. You yourself reject the once universal, literal interpretation of Genesis - how is that not religion being redesigned to accommodate your rational understanding of the world?\n \n \nRegardless, the point is that religion is not commanded by the committee, and the fact it is so independent is part of the reason it takes time for the rational to influence it in matters where it needs to be influenced.\n\n \n You are the only one here even talking about a committee. I explained in some detail the mechanism by which religion is redesigned to accommodate (or loudly deny) scientific advances, and neither used nor implied the concept of a central organising committee.\n \n \nOf course! Religion is about matters of faith--those of the unexplainable and unobservable. So I would completely agree with you here; in many respects religion is the one honest attempt to say the very opposite: that we don't have it spot on.\n\n \n Utter tripe, jyoshu; that's an appalling attempt at dissembling. Science is the honest evaluation of the extent of our ignorance, coupled with the determination to narrow those gaps. Faith merely plugs the gaps with whatever comes to hand and either declares its knowledge complete, or declares what remains unknowable (as you are doing). Religion has no interest in discovering actual truths, only in exploiting humankind's psychological need to mitigate uncertainty. \n \n \nNo, there are ways to say that Grandpa is not in heaven without making fun of the scripture and beliefs inscribed on the urn.\n\n \n Have I barged into someone's front room here, jyoshu? Do I have grandpa's urn before me? No. I am debating on an internet discussion forum, where opinions may be robustly and vigorously attacked and defended, on both sides of any argument. \n \n Even more significantly, you're deliberately conflating criticism of a belief with criticism of your defence of that belief.\n \n Recall the argument thus far. Your defence of particular beliefs has been that they are 'beyond reason', or 'a matter of faith'. My response to that - as is that of others - is to point out that defence could equally apply to any belief, however patently absurd.\n \n If I made a claim that could be refuted by demonstrating how it could equally apply to something clearly ridiculous, you wouldn't hesitate, would you? I would have made a poor argument, and showing that it was poor would necessarily involve pointing out its silliness.\n \n That's all I'm doing here, jyoshu: demonstrating the failure of your defence. If I've made a logical error, point it out. If you have a better defence of religious beliefs that doesn't lump them in with flying spaghetti monsters and unfeasibly hued mammals, let's hear it!\n \n \nThe 800 lb elephant here is the extent of how dear these beliefs are to people, an extent of which I still don't think you realize.\n\n \n Ironically enough, that's a really small elephant. No, don't get all excited, it was just an observation.\n \n jyoshu, think about this for a moment. All along I've been arguing how harmful it is to instill these passionately held irrational beliefs, and you've been denying it every step of the way. Now you're warning me that people taught to believe in such a fashion are easily upset and less likely to respond to rational argument. \n \n Should I just go, and let you finish making my case for me?\n \n \nBut regardless of all that, and regardless of whether or not you agree, I can assure you that your vinegar will be attracting a lot less flies than if you used honey.\n\n \n If I were in a more flippant mood, I might say the task facing me is not to attract flies with honey or vinegar, but to persuade them that what they are currently buzzing around and settling upon is not, in fact, honey.",

Science can't really explain evil in the world, the idea of atonement, what comforts a grieving widow, etc. No amount of scientific explanation is going to offer the comfort to a grieving parent than the idea that their child's soul lives on in some way. (And it's not like you've been able to demonstrate any harm there. Psychology, which recgonizes the value of beliefs like that in helping people get through bereavement is not on your side!) I don't know how many more ways to say it Peeling--they are not scientific issues, and not every issue is scientific.\n \n \nIn the past, were not more things unexplained and unobserved, and were not these too, then, part of faith?\n\n \n I get the sense that you've hit the rewind button and have gone back as if we never went through this earlier. You know I've explained this already. As if you were \"reset\" at some point and lost everything I've been telling you. These are cases where the church impeded on issues of science and the observable. The line was crossed by the church into areas it had no business being. That line is not faith altogether, it's when faith tries to explain scientific matters. It's really not so difficult to understand the difference between a philosophical/metaphysical matter and a scientific matter. At least it's not so hard for most people. \n \n \nUtter tripe, jyoshu; that's an appalling attempt at dissembling.

Religion has no interest in discovering actual truths, only in exploiting humankind's psychological need to mitigate uncertainty. \n\n \n Not at all. Some people in science look at the world and tries to explain everything, even matters that science clearly can't and even sometimes shouldn't! No offense, but you are a perfect example. Your refusal to even admit or realize that there are issues people face in life that science can't answer only reinforces that reality to me. Religion looks at the world and admits it's not all explainable and that there are areas of mystery. (And as such I'm beginning to realize that you are operating off of a VERY poor understanding of what religion is all about.) Where religion has failed is when it crossed that line and got out of the realm of mystery and tried to substitute itself for science. The one thing you said correctly is that \"religion has no interest in discovering actual truths.\" This is correct from the standpoint of scientific truths, thank goodness, because there are aspects of life that simply aren't concrete that science can't do much about. That doesn't mean that religion has, from time to time, delved into areas it shouldn't, but these are simply cases where it crossed the line.\n \n \nHave I barged into someone's front room here, jyoshu? Do I have grandpa's urn before me? No. I am debating on an internet discussion forum, where opinions may be robustly and vigorously attacked and defended, on both sides of any argument.\n\n \n Come on, now Peeling; I know you are smart enough to understand the concept of an analogy and illustration fully. The urn is an analogy here--I wasn't suggesting you've barged into anyone's living room. Your point that this is a forum where opiniond are attacked robustly and vigorously is also a defense for me using the analogy!\n \n \nEven more significantly, you're deliberately conflating criticism of a belief with criticism of your defence of that belief. Recall the argument thus far. Your defence of particular beliefs has been that they are 'beyond reason', or 'a matter of faith'. My response to that - as is that of others - is to point out that defence could equally apply to any belief, however patently absurd.\n\n \n But it can't be applied to any belief--the litmus test to see whether it can rightfully apply IS whether or not a given issue is scientific. If the issue is geocentricity, then it can't apply. If the issue is a grieving widow or the concept of atonement for evil, it can (since those are situations and ideas outside the realm of science).\n \n \nThat's all I'm doing here, jyoshu: demonstrating out the failure of your defence. If I've made a logical error, point it out. If you have a better defence of religious beliefs that doesn't lump them in with flying spaghetti monsters and unfeasibly hued mammals, let's hear it!\n\n \n Your logical error is clear: it's assuming science applies as an effective means of dealing with ALL things and ALL situations. It doesn't. It's that simple.\n \n \njyoshu, think about this for a moment. All along I've been arguing how harmful it is to instill these passionately held irrational beliefs, and you've been denying it every step of the way. Now you're warning me that people taught to believe in such a fashion are easily upset and less likely to respond to rational argument. Should I just go, and let you finish making my case for me?\n\n \n Peeling, you came in on this particular issue between me and another poster. I was not even discussing the matter of tone with you, until you came and commented on it. (my response was to a different poster altogether.) The fact you think religion is irrational and harmful is a separate matter than whether or not atheists could stand to show respect. You're trying to twist this back into our earlier discussion. Showing respect toward people is generally considered a thoughtful thing to do--courtesy is . . . . well . . . a rational approach. (ahem)",

It hardly requires a vaulting leap of faith to understand why 'your child is not really dead' might be a comfort, now does it?\n \n \nAnd it's not like you've been able to demonstrate any harm there\n\n \n Nor is it 'like' I've even tried. Faith is the root problem, not any specific beliefs it may shelter.\n \n A belief's psychological benefits in certain circumstances has no bearing on whether it is true. Nor is it an argument for preaching faith as a virtue in general; we do not practice routine chemotherapy just in case someone gets cancer. If you prefer to liken these beliefs to daily vitamins, we do not shove a whole load of useless or ambiguous chemicals in along with the vitamins, or teach people that swallowing anything that looks like a pill is a good idea.\n \n To address the other specifics you raise: \n \n The religious notion of 'evil' has, in my opinion, been nothing but counterproductive in that it denies the possibility of understanding, and understanding leads to better preventative measures. People are people, even when they commit atrocities, and they can be understood. It may not lessen grief or anger, but it can certainly direct those emotions to better use.\n \n Atonement (specifically that involving Jesus) is frankly bizarre: as far as I can tell nobody understands it or seems to think understanding is necessary; a total abdication of critical thought.\n \n \nThe line was crossed by the church into areas it had no business being. That line is not faith altogether, it's when faith tries to explain scientific matters. It's really not so difficult to understand the difference between a philosophical/metaphysical matter and a scientific matter.\n\n \n Then why have religious people been getting it wrong for thousands of years? How can faith have been trying to explain 'scientific matters' when science had not reached there yet?\n \n I do understand the picture you're trying to paint, but it doesn't make sense. According to you, religion was 'crossing the line' back when Genesis was written. The idea's potty; people at the time just thought the line was somewhere else. Go far enough back and there wasn't even a line; there was just faith.\n \n You think you know where the line should be now; bible literalists think it should be somewhere else - the reality is, science defines the scope of knowledge, uncertainty and ignorance, not beliefs. On a personal level, even though you are predisposed towards faith, your scientific understanding defines the scope of the irrational beliefs you will tolerate.\n \n \nNot at all. Some people in science look at the world and tries to explain everything, even matters that science clearly can't and even sometimes shouldn't!\n\n \n Can't and shouldn't according to you, who are no expert in any relevant field. Nor am I, of course, which is why I choose to keep an open mind.\n \n \nNo offense, but you are a perfect example. Your refusal to even admit or realize that there are issues people face in life that science can't answer only reinforces that reality to me.\n\n \n What I freely admit is that science doesn't have all the answers yet, and perhaps never will. I don't see why I should admit to this state of affairs being permanent when you have no evidence to that effect and science has continually proved those who would impose limits on it wrong, time and time again.\n \n \nReligion looks at the world and admits it's not all explainable and that there are areas of mystery.\n\n \n The word you're looking for is declares.\n \n \nThe one thing you said correctly is that \"religion has no interest in discovering actual truths.\"\n\n \n You know, a lesser man would add that to their .sig.\n \n \nCome on, now Peeling; I know you are smart enough to understand the concept of an analogy and illustration fully. The urn is an analogy here--I wasn't suggesting you've barged into anyone's living room.\n\n \n No; you suggested that my presenting of arguments here would cause offence as if I had done as you describe. Or are you saying your analogy was poorly chosen? If so, you're right, because this is not your turf, and you are voluntarily exposing yourself to my criticism in the spirit of debate. \n \n \nBut it can't be applied to any belief--the litmus test to see whether it can rightfully apply IS whether or not a given issue is scientific. If the issue is geocentricity, then it can't apply. If the issue is a grieving widow or the concept of atonement for evil, it can (since those are situations and ideas outside the realm of science).\n\n \n I dealt with the grieving widow above; there's nothing mystical about the consolation offered by belief in an afterlife. \n \n The Flying Spaghetti Monster, on the other hand, is a non-scientific belief. It is invisible, intangible and all-powerful. Its existence is thoroughly undisprovable, even in principle; it is purely a matter of faith. Your defence shelters it perfectly well. According to your arguments thus far, belief in the FSM is every bit as valid and should be respected just as much as your version of christianity.\n \n \nYour logical error is clear: it's assuming science applies as an effective means of dealing with ALL things and ALL situations. It doesn't. It's that simple.\n\n \n Alternatively, your logical error is in assuming there is anything genuinely beyond the reach of science (which, remember, is merely the willingness to test and refine ideas against reality, and the willingness to accurately assess the confidence with which assertions can be made) worth dealing with at all, an assumption you have yet to substantiate.\n \n You still haven't answered my question: what about the issues that aren't natural or supernatural? What's the best way of dealing with them?\n \n \nPeeling, you came in on this particular issue between me and another poster. I was not even discussing the matter of tone with you, until you came and commented on it. \n\n \n Quite right.

   "Not seeking to answer for Peeling - this is my two-penn'orth.\n \nScience can't really explain evil in the world...\n\n Evil is the label we give to the breaking of extreme taboos by others; those who do the breaking find ways of justifying it. The Nazi death camps are regarded by most of us as the epitome of evil; but we have to face the fact that those who ran them found ways of persuading themselves they were undertaking an unpleasant duty in the service of a greater good. Many Germans will apply the term 'evil' to USAF and RAF carpet bombing of German cities; so, to be fair, will many present-day Brits and Yanks, but at the time most would have held it to be a justifiable means to an end. Humans are capable of a huge range of behaviours to further their own interests: 'evil' is just the name we give to some of these behaviours in others. It is a cultural construct.\n \n... the idea of atonement...\n\n Are you using this is its general sense, or in the specifically christian sense? In social anthropology the idea of atonement is very well established, and highly functional in the running of a society. If as I suspect you mean the christian usage, it is futile to castigate science for having no explanation for a fiction.\n \n... what comforts a grieving widow, etc. No amount of scientific explanation is going to offer the comfort to a grieving parent than the idea that their child's soul lives on in some way.\n\n Indeed, but the readiness of human brains to accept and indeed seek such illusions is perfectly explicable. We are innately disposed to be reason-seekers and meaning-seekers: our brains are very poor indeed at dealing with contingency, or with the notion that events do not revolve around us. The fact that a belief comforts a grieving parent has no bearing whatsoever on the belief's objective validity.",

Who are you to say it should stop where you personally want it to?\n \n \nWhen religion uses Genesis as a science book instead of for the sake of teaching spiritual principles as it was intended (as most ancient stories like that were) then religion errs. It's very simple.\n\n \n The only reason you now believe that to have been the intention, is that that interpretation is the only one left open to you by science (other than simply interpreting them as evangelical fiction, as I do). A few hundred years ago you'd have happily believed in their literal truth, and defended to the hilt their intention to narrate creation.\n \n \nKnowledge about the observable, I would agree. It does not define what it cannot deal with.\n\n \n For one thing, there can only be knowledge about the observable. Anything else is not knowledge. For another, you're confusing science defining those things it does not deal with and the scope of things it does not deal with.\n \n Science has broadened its horizons, and simuntaneously shrunk the scope of things about which it makes no comment. Science does not define what god might be, but it does define what god is not. One of the things god has been shown to be not, is necessary.\n \n \nAbout everything except religion.\n\n \n I have an open mind about individual religions in that I'm willing to be convinced, given evidence and solid argument, that the individual beliefs they promote represent truth. Faith, on the other hand, is the permanent acceptance of a hypothesis without or in the face of evidence - it is the closure of one's mind to alternatives or the possibility of evidence ever coming to light. Asking me to have an open mind about the benefits of closing one's mind is silly enough; berating me for having a closed mind about the benefits of closing one's mind is laughable.\n \n \nGiven that you know science might never answer everything, are you willing to take a step farther and say that there are matters that science can't really adequately deal with?\n\n \n No. Although science cannot disprove such things as the flying spaghetti monster, it does adequately deal with them, by doing what it always does and placing the burden of proof on the concept's advocate. \n \n Moreover, you have yet to demonstrate any purpose to 'dealing with' metaphysical issues that is not trivially self-referential. I can assume whatever nonsense I like and then try to deal with it; that doesn't make 'dealing with it' anything other than a waste of time.\n \n \n???? But belief in the afterlife IS religion!!! It's a case where religion works and science doesn't! Don't you see?? Arrggh.\n\n \n Steady, now. Saying religion works here is treading on thin ice. Do placebos 'work'? No; our mind 'works', reducing stress levels and making a successful recovery more likely. This is true even when there is no genuine treatment available. \n \n Can science console a grieving mother? Maybe not, but it has reduced infant mortality rates by around 98% in the last 150 years. I would suggest that counts as much more effective 'consolation' for the millions who would otherwise have grieved.\n \n Upon reflection, I should have distinguished much earlier between belief and hope. \n \n A healthy-minded individual buys a lottery ticket in the hope of winning, not the belief he will. Often that's as far as it goes. When gambling becomes a belief that one day your big win will come, people start getting into trouble. \n \n Do I hope there's some kind of after-life? In the sense that it would be interesting if there was, yes. Do I believe there is one? No. I would never deny a grieving mother the hope of there being an afterlife, but I would discourage teaching the belief in one that sometimes leads people to waste or prematurely curtail the one life they (and on occasion others) certainly do possess.\n \n Hope might be characterised as a dalliance with belief whilst retaining a healthy sense of perspective. Faith is the loss of that perspective.\n \n \nSo is the idea of an afterlife.\n\n \n Er... yes, I know. That was the point I was making. Your 'matter of faith' defence of one applies equally as a defence of the other. What I want to know is, do you acknowledge the equivalent validity of belief in the FSM with belief in christianity's 'undisprovables'?\n \n \nSuch as situations where neither science OR religion can help? Not sure. I'll have to think about that some more.\n\n \n I realised belatedly that question wasn't originally directed at you. Sorry!\n \n \nBut a lack of respect is what I was talking about, not \"attacking\" anyone's beliefs.\n\n \n It is not lack of respect towards a belief to show that your defence of it could equally apply to something silly.

   "Psychology explains why certain beliefs - though false as far as we can tell - might still offer consolation under certain circumstances. It explains one of the reasons religion manages to flourish; it does not 'back its use'.\n\n \n I think you've missed the point here. Psychology shows that these beliefs are beneficial. It goes against your idea that matters of faith are never beneficial. But even then, you'd really need to show how they are truly harmful for your opposition to carry any real weight. \n \n \nThis is one of those times where an argument could also be used to defend something really silly.\n\n \n That's right! And it should be. That's why people (other than those paranoid over not being rational enough) don't worry too much about putting everything in life through some rationalism filter or litmus test. It's ok that some people believe or think a way that you think is \"silly!\" Again, I'd hate to think my life was lived that way. I know you think I'm trying to 'portray' you a certain way when I say things like that, but I'm not--I really would not want my life lived in cold rationality. That really is where your logic leads. We don't normally try to tell people how to live their lives unless we can demonstrate how the way they are living it is harmful.\n \n \nAnd I've already told you that it was science itself that established those instances as belonging to 'its realm', by testing religious hypotheses against reality and finding them wanting. Who are you to say it should stop where you personally want it to?\n\n \n Where have I said I think it should stop??? Science is more than welcome to do what it wants. I don't see religion as a whole trying to stop science from doing anything. (Although religion does serve to help keep science ethical sometimes, by bringing up ethical matters related to things like cloning, for instance) But that's only parts of religion.\n \n I think you need to realize that religion is not some highly organized thing. There's no membership card; it just happens that a lot of people in the world are religious. Different groups do different things--some religious people have no problem with science doing what it wants. in fact a lot of very good scientists throughout history WERE religious, and there are plenty of good scientists now that are.\n \n \nThe only reason you now believe that to have been the intention, is that that interpretation is the only one left open to you by science (other than simply interpreting them as evangelical fiction, as I do). A few hundred years ago you'd have happily believed in their literal truth, and defended to the hilt their intention to narrate creation.\n\n \n But science came along and showed the church it needs to limit it's matters of truth to non-scientific matters. The fact I might not have thought that way earlier on proves nothing. You seem to think that because science disproves something that religion once held to it invalidates ALL religion. This is not very rational thinking on your part. The only reason the church filled the void on scientific matters like that at the time is that the enlightenment had not happened and people had nowhere else to turn for scientific matters. They were doing the best they could. But none of that speaks to matters of faith and religion.\n \n \nFor one thing, there can only be knowledge about the observable. Anything else is not knowledge. For another, you're confusing science defining those things it does not deal with and the scope of things it does not deal with.\n\n \n Right--it's faith. That's the point. You're confusing them by making an arguemnt about knowledge toward faith. I have not said that faith is knowledge; I'm arguing against your idea that faith should be viewed and opposed in the same way that knowledge would be. Your entire argument seems to be based on the idea that you view faith as some sort of competition with knowledge, and it's not.\n \n \nScience has broadened its horizons, and simuntaneously shrunk the scope of things about which it makes no comment. Science does not define what god might be, but it does define what god is not. One of the things god has been shown to be not, is necessary.\n\n \n The only thing it has really done in this case is show where matters are truly matters of the empirical rather than matters of faith. It showed that geo-centricity is real and proved it to be a non-faith scientific matter. It helped the church realize that it needs to limit it's areas to those religious matters, not the empirical. And God certainly has not been shown to be unnecessary, because you have nothing to point to for a first cause for all existence. But that's only in the realm of the observable in the universe--from a philosophical standpoint, people everyday feel they need God. They feel that God certainly IS necessary in their lives, and that alone is good enough to validate religion.\n \n \nI have an open mind about individual religions in that I'm willing to be convinced, given evidence and solid argument, that the individual beliefs they promote represent truth. \n\n \n What sort of truth--empirical truth? Religion can't do that, and that's where I think you've gone wrong here--you view religion as some sort of means to answer the empirical; it HAS been at times but that's not the purpose of religion at all. If you're looking toward religion to provide answers for the physical universe, you've got religion all wrong. It can address matters of faith and philosophical/spiritual matters.\n \n \n- it is the closure of one's mind to alternatives or the possibility of evidence ever coming to light. Asking me to have an open mind about the benefits of closing one's mind is silly enough; berating me for having a closed mind about the benefits of closing one's mind is laughable.\n\n \n The problem here is that religion isn't about closing one's mind--do you not realize that a lot of religious people believe in much of, if not all of the same scientific truths that you do??? No one here is berating you or even suggesting to you benefits of closing your mind to scientifc knowledge!! Where did you get that idea?\n \n \nCan science console a grieving mother? Maybe not, but it has reduced infant mortality rates by around 98% in the last 150 years. I would suggest that counts as much more effective 'consolation' for the millions who would otherwise have grieved.\n\n \n And that is great! That is where science helps us a great deal, and I'm vvery thankful for it. But religion concerns itself with the state of mind of those grieving. Science can't deal with that because it's an area of religion/philosophy. You're muddying those separate realms together and it just doesn't work.\n \n \nUpon reflection, I should have distinguished much earlier between belief and hope.\n \n \n Those two are not necessarily distinguishable. Hope in an afterlife IS belief in an afterlife.\n \n \nWhat I want to know is, do you acknowledge the equivalent validity of belief in the FSM with belief in christianity's 'undisprovables'?\n\n \n No, because there aren't billions of people attesting to religious experience with the FSM, nor are there accounts from it's first years of having walked around with him and seen him doing things. Christianity is not a matter of \"IF\" there's evidence, it's a matter of how you view the evidence that's there.",

   "I think you've missed the point here. Psychology shows that these beliefs are beneficial. It goes against your idea that matters of faith are never beneficial.\n\n \n These beliefs, jyoshu, which may console even when they are merely expressed as hope. Psychology does not show faith itself (an unjustifiable degree of conviction) to be beneficial. Rather it associates it with mania and psychosis.\n \n \nAgain, I'd hate to think my life was lived that way. I know you think I'm trying to 'portray' you a certain way when I say things like that, but I'm not--I really would not want my life lived in cold rationality. That really is where your logic leads. \n\n \n If you do not wish to portray me as cold and joyless, why do you persist in using those words to describe my philosophy? I am clearly neither of those things; doesn't that tell you something about the prejudice you hold against atheists?\n \n My world contains more mysteries than yours - mysteries I can hope to one day perceive more clearly, if not see them entirely unravelled, yet I am not so frightened of ignorance that I must seize the first hypothesis that passes to fully explain those mysteries, nor so prideful that I would claim the tattered rag remaining in my hand, worried at by centuries of scientific teeth, is what was 'really' intended to be there all along. \n \n I reject the supernatural for the very simple reason that, logically, anything genuinely supernatural can never interact with reality in any way - if it could, it would be detectable, measurable, and therefore not supernatural. The only detectable influence on reality is through the actions of people who pretend supernatural entities exist. I'm a writer of stories and videogames, a reader of fantasy and SF novels; I'm not opposed to flights of fancy or suspension of disbelief, but I take a very dim view of teaching children to take imaginary entities seriously.\n \n \nI think you need to realize that religion is not some highly organized thing.\n\n \n And I think it would serve you well to listen when I say for the umpteenth time that's not the point. It is a facilitator of organisation; it makes it easy for crazy people with crazy ideas to get other people to help them. You don't need religion to get people to help do good.\n \n \nBut science came along and showed the church it needs to limit it's matters of truth to non-scientific matters.\n\n \n Oh, jyoshu, you say 'non-scientific matters' as if you can be sure what that means. How many times must we go through this? Throughout history people have thought they've known what 'non-scientific matters' meant, and throughout history they've been wrong. What makes you different?\n \n \nThe fact I might not have thought that way earlier on proves nothing. You seem to think that because science disproves something that religion once held to it invalidates ALL religion.\n\n \n It demonstrates that faith is a bad way to go about deciding things that matter.\n \n \nIt helped the church realize that it needs to limit it's areas to those religious matters, not the empirical.\n\n \n If you're happy for faith to only apply to imaginary situations and never ever lead to real-world consequences or behaviour, I'm happy too.\n \n Or rather, I would be if people taught that faith is a virtue didn't keep putting harmful, real-world affecting beliefs behind their god-wall.\n \n \nAnd God certainly has not been shown to be unnecessary, because you have nothing to point to for a first cause for all existence.\n\n \n And you have nothing to point to as a first cause for God. Remember: if we're talking about a creator god, that's not philosophical or metaphysical, that's something real, capable of effecting reality (pun intended). Him 'just existing' is no less of a mystery than the universe 'just becoming'. As I pointed out to epaphras, the only reason it feels like less of a mystery is its congruence with our childhood perception of a father-figure.\n \n \nfrom a philosophical standpoint, people everyday feel they need God. They feel that God certainly IS necessary in their lives, and that alone is good enough to validate religion.\n\n \n My word, that's a whole other can of worms. Lots of people feel they can't get by without cigarettes either; is that good enough to validate their production? Even though the perceived but illusionary loss of giving them up is deliberately engendered by the manufacturers to dissuade people from quitting?\n \n Besides, yet again you're trying to sidestep the issue of faith and talk about individual beliefs. One may hope without having faith; one may even believe without having faith - as I believe in certain scientific principles, whilst acknowledging they may one day be overturned. \n \n \n It can address matters of faith and philosophical/spiritual matters.\n\n \n As I've said, if faith were truly only ever applied to 'spiritual' (imaginary) matters, there would be no problem. Unfortunately it is not; it drives real-world behaviour. So much for your claim that religion does not address the physical world.\n \n \nNo one here is berating you or even suggesting to you benefits of closing your mind to scientifc knowledge!! Where did you get that idea?\n\n \n From your repeated assertion that faith is a virtue; where else? Faith implies accepting one hypothesis (be it the existence of god, what constitutes righteous behaviour, or anything else) and unjustifiably closing ones mind to alternatives; how can you know evidence or conjecture will never impact upon such beliefs?\n \n You say you are only closing your mind where it doesn't matter; I say you can't know that you are right to say that, and I prefer to keep a truly open mind.\n \n \nYou're muddying those separate realms together and it just doesn't work.\n\n \n Then I'll do you a deal: you concede that religion, being purely spiritual, should cease to make any claims or pronouncements that lead to any real-world consequences or behaviour, and I'll retract my claim that helping 99.5% of children survive in the physical world is a more effective salve to grief than lying about the certainty of an afterlife for which there is no evidence.\n \n \nThose two are not necessarily distinguishable. Hope in an afterlife IS belief in an afterlife.\n\n \n Worried about this one, aren't you? Hope is not belief, as is clear from the gambling example I made. One may hope for life after death, but one must really believe to strap explosives to one's stomach and detonate them. The difference is faith. Which is, as I've said all along, the problem.\n \n \nnor are there accounts from it's first years of having walked around with him and seen him doing things.\n\n \n Give it a couple of thousand years.",

I am clearly neither of those things\n\n \n Because there's no other logical end. After all, you certainly are cold toward religion and faith. Why should I assume you would not apply your thinking toward ANY case where reason were not given supremacy? If you don't, then that's inconsistency on your part. And let's be very careful here--I didn't say you were without emotion. I didn't say you were joyless. If you're human you're emotional.\n \n \nyet I am not so frightened of ignorance that I must seize the first hypothesis that passes to fully explain those mysteries, nor so prideful that I would claim the tattered rag remaining in my hand, worried at by centuries of scientific teeth, is what was 'really' intended to be there all along. \n\n \n Neither am I, Peeling. I simply choose to live my life differently. The fact you attribute my way of thinking to \"fear\" indicates prejudice, or at least misunderstanding and ignorance, on your part. I've told you now that I, as a religious person, am not fearful or opposed to scientific discovery. I applaud it, and where it shows religion to be wrong, so be it. But because it can't show spiritual views to be wrong, then I have nothing to fear from science, as a religious person. It doesn't affect me and my faith in the least for science to prove the earth couldn't have been made in 6 days. Or that there's no way the sun could have stopped in the sky duing a battle. Those are observable matters in the natural universe! My faith isn't dependent on those matters. There are lots and lots of scientists out there who have relatively little trouble whatsoever, as you seem to, of reconciling religion and science. Nor did plenty of very good scientists in the past who spent a lot of time observing the natural universe such as Kepler, Newton, Thomson (Kelvin), Faraday, Joule, Carver, Boyle, etc ... the list can go on and on, with both pre and post-enlightenment scientists. These men weren't so \"frightened of ignorance\" either, given the enormous strides they made in their fields of expertise. Yet they didn't reject religion. Why should I take your view, of whom has no published scientific credibility that I am aware of, over the apparent views of these giants in the field of science who apparently had a much different worldview than you do? But the real question is, are you willing to look at that and say \"maybe since some very quality scientists have had no problem reconciling faith and science, maybe the problem isn't with faith but with my own worldview concerning what religion/faith is really all about\"? Because I'm more convinced now than ever that's the problem here. Your conclusions are from you perceptions, but you perceptions have been colored by your prejudices. That's not necessarily entirely your fault however; the problems religion has had no doubt influences your thinking.\n \n \nI reject the supernatural for the very simple reason that, logically, anything genuinely supernatural can never interact with reality in any way - if it could, it would be detectable, measurable, and therefore not supernatural. The only detectable influence on reality is through the actions of people who pretend supernatural entities exist. I'm a writer of stories and videogames, a reader of fantasy and SF novels; I'm not opposed to flights of fancy or suspension of disbelief, but I take a very dim view of teaching children to take imaginary entities seriously.\n\n \n That's fair enough, and I have no problem that you reject the supernatural for your belief system (or choose not to have a belief system--however you want to look at it). Lots of people do that. What I have a problem with is your intolerance of it in others; your view that it should be discouraged in other people. Whether you realize it or not, lots of us have already wrestled with these issues you've brought up. It's not like we haven't weighed through this already--our conclusions we came to are different than yours. Now no doubt you think that our conclusions are wrong--backwards perhaps--and you are free to make your personal judgements. But we're free to do that as well, and some of us believe that the value of beliefs isn't necessarily tied to whether or not those beliefs are rational. The issue isn't that we measure poorly on your measuring ruler--indeed we may; it's that we don't accept that your measuring ruler is the only one that counts. \n \n \nit makes it easy for crazy people with crazy ideas to get other people to help them.\n\n \n But you reject religion even in cases where that's not happening!\n \n \nIf you're happy for faith to only apply to imaginary situations and never ever lead to real-world consequences or behaviour, I'm happy too.\n\n \n Why would you be threatened by the idea of faith leading someone to good deeds and humanitarian efforts? Those are behaviors! Those are real-world consequences. On one hand you don't seem to mind defining faith by the negatives it's brought along through history, but you refuse to allow me to also define faith by the positives it's brought. You can't have it both ways. And just because humanitarianism can come out of non-faith sources doesn't invalidate the fact it can comes from faith as well.\n \n \nAs I've said, if faith were truly only ever applied to 'spiritual' (imaginary) matters, there would be no problem. Unfortunately it is not; it drives real-world behaviour. So much for your claim that religion does not address the physical world.\n \n Or rather, I would be if people taught that faith is a virtue didn't keep putting harmful, real-world affecting beliefs behind their god-wall.\n\n \n And yet you've defined what \"harmful\" consists of here so broadly, that all faith itself is included, am I right? What if we disagree on what matters of faith are really harmful? Because we probably will. The only feasible solution here is to condemn things based on demonstrable harm. That's why I would agree with you that where religion has done demonstrable harm it should be condemned. But not where it can't be demonstrated, and not by the fear factor of what it's capable of.\n \n \nHim 'just existing' is no less of a mystery than the universe 'just becoming'.\n\n \n Then if you can imagine the concept of a universe \"just becoming\" why can you not imagine the concept of God?\n \n \nFaith implies accepting one hypothesis (be it the existence of god, what constitutes righteous behaviour, or anything else) and unjustifiably closing ones mind to alternatives\n\n \n No, it does not!! Not necessarily anyway. Where science disproves faith's assumptions about the natural universe, I'm on your side, Peeling. The evidence proves those assumptions wrong. That doesn't destroy the faith, it destroys the assumptions.\n \n \nYou say you are only closing your mind where it doesn't matter; I say you can't know that you are right to say that, and I prefer to keep a truly open mind.\n\n \n So you have an open mind to the idea of science comforting a grieving widow? Or science offering philosophical answers? I think you'll be waiting a very, very long time for that to happen. As in, forever.\n \n \nGive it a couple of thousand years.\n\n \n I don't understand this comment.

   "Ok, back and refreshed and in a considerably lighter mood!\n \n What I want to focus on first, jyoshu, is the way you treat faith, belief, beliefs, irrational beliefs, hope, religion, religions, people who happen to be religious and people who happen to hold beliefs, irrational or otherwise, as if they were interchangeable in this discussion. A case in point, regarding how psychology explains why belief in life after death offers consolation:\n \nPsychology, which recgonizes the value of beliefs like that in helping people get through bereavement is not on your side!\n\n \nI guess I don't understand how, when Psychology (as a field) backs the use of religion,\n\n \nOn the contrary, it does show that faith provides comfort to the grieving. I can't imagine why that's something you seem to have a problem with.\n\n And another:\n \nAnd yet you've defined what \"harmful\" consists of here so broadly, that all faith itself is included, am I right?\n\n \nThat's why I would agree with you that where religion has done demonstrable harm it should be condemned.\n\n I could source similar quotes from throughout the last twenty-odd pages.\n \n Deliberate evasiveness or not, this refusal to distinguish between concepts has made it practically impossible for me to make any statement without then having to spend the next few posts rebutting all the different ways you've misrepresented it. I find it particularly objectionable, after being thus misrepresented, to be faced with inferred conclusions such as this:\n \nBecause there's no other logical end. After all, you certainly are cold toward religion and faith. Why should I assume you would not apply your thinking toward ANY case where reason were not given supremacy? \n\n and to find myself defending my essential humanity while your superstitions give you a free pass.\n \n When I speak of faith, I speak of something very specific. When I criticise faith, I criticise the holding of beliefs with unjustifiable fervour; the abandonment of healthy perspective, nothing more. If I want to criticise individual beliefs, religions, or people, I will do so in my own time and without your assistance.\n \n Now, as I see it there are several sub-threads running through this discussion, many of them spawned by the muddling of concepts I describe above. The first concerns the relationship between religion, 'spiritual matters' and science:\n \nI applaud <scientific progress<, and where it shows religion to be wrong, so be it. But because it can't show spiritual views to be wrong, then I have nothing to fear from science, as a religious person. It doesn't affect me and my faith in the least for science to prove the earth couldn't have been made in 6 days.\n\n \nThe fact I might ... have thought <that the earth had been made in 6 days< earlier on proves nothing.\n\n To say that science's discovery that the world was not made in six days \"doesn't affect you and your faith in the slightest\" is rather like a frozen puddle, perceiving itself to be unyielding, announcing that the ground containing it does not dictate its shape. As an avowed christian you reject belief in a six-day creation entirely thanks to the historical efforts of science; that is the simple truth.\n \n It is undeniable that over hundreds of years, science of the real, observable and testable has continued to claim as its own concepts previously believed to be of spiritual, philosophical or supernatural character. Demonic possession, disease, the nature of evil, our biological origins, our perception of morality; the list continues to grow.\n \n Your alternative interpretation of this one-way transfer of territory, that religion in the past was overstepping its bounds in making statements about the real and testable and that now, in you, it is expressed correctly, ignores the crucial fact that, at the time, people in the past also thought they were correctly delineating the spiritual from the physical.\n \n The kinds of observations we can make and the logical and mathematical tools we possess to derive information from them are beyond the wildest dreams of people living a few centuries ago. Who are you to say that trend will not continue? What will moderates profess to believe in another hundred years, do you think? Will they perhaps excuse your misconceptions as 'religion overstepping its bounds' too? I do not predict these events, only observe that you cannot discount them.\n \n Thus we arrive at:\n \n 1. Your chosen partition between spiritual and scientific matters, while it might seem reasonable now, cannot be asserted with confidence.\n \n Note that it is the \"cannot be asserted with confidence\" part alone which links back to my argument against faith. I don't mind if you believe in god, the FSM, or little faeries, provided you have a head on your shoulders when it comes to evaluating your level of confidence in those beliefs, your judgement of how important they are and the scope of their application, because it is that that determines whether or not a belief becomes dangerous - especially in terms of spreading, causing harm to others, or becoming touchpaper for ideological/religious conflict. Every incidence of harm being done in the name of religion - or non-theistic ideologies, such as Stalin's communism or even contemporary democracy - can be traced to the adoption and spread of fanatically held belief.\n \n According to religion, however, investing a great deal of emotion and ego in holding fast to beliefs is a virtue, regardless of - and in some cases deliberately in spite of - the level of confidence reason would attach to them.\n \n Thus we arrive at:\n \n 2. Religion troubles me because it teaches that faith is a virtue\n \n Are you with me so far?\n \n Next we come to the issue of good and bad deeds, and their relationship with faith, religion, beliefs and people.\n \nWhy would you be threatened by the idea of faith leading someone to good deeds and humanitarian efforts?\n\n The quote above does a particularly good job of muddying the waters. Not only does it make the - so far repeatedly unsubstantiated - leap from \"people who happen to hold religious beliefs also do good deeds\" to \"religion causes people to do good deeds\", it hops and skips all the way to \"faith causes people to do good deeds\".\n \n I have yet to see any evidence that unjustified levels of confidence in one's beliefs leads to good deeds, whereas it is trivial to demonstrate that it can lead to bad deeds.\n \n This, then, is why I find religion troubling. Not because religions are superstitious, and not because many of the beliefs they teach are irrational. As you say: sometimes (though it should be stressed not often, given the sheer thundering immensity of potential irrationality) irrational beliefs can have valuable side-effects that rational ones cannot provide.\n \nsome of us believe that the value of beliefs isn't necessarily tied to whether or not those beliefs are rational.\n\n I am happy for you to include me in that number. I'm really not the wannabe robot you seem convinced I am:\n \n 3. What I do ask of beliefs is much less rigorous: only that they have rational value, or at the very least, that the fervour with which they are held and defended be proportional to that value.\n \nNo amount of scientific explanation is going to offer the comfort to a grieving parent than the idea that their child's soul lives on in some way. (And it's not like you've been able to demonstrate any harm there. Psychology, which recgonizes the value of beliefs like that in helping people get through bereavement is not on your side!\n\n Now can you see why psychology is on my side? The hope of an afterlife can be a comfort: that is an observable, rational benefit. It does some good. You do not need to be religious to entertain that hope; I admitted as much myself. You certaintly do not need faith, either; I do not believe to any degree at all in an afterlife - but I can always hope I'm wrong :)\n \n So there we have it. I hope now you can appreciate my true standpoint.\n \n Just to tidy things up, a little bit about god:\n \nThen if you can imagine the concept of a universe \"just becoming\" why can you not imagine the concept of <a creator< God?\n\n I can quite easily imagine such a concept; I am simply conscious that it is an exercise of the imagination and that it ultimately explains nothing.\n \n A purely metaphysical, imaginary god is one thing. One might argue (though I would disagree) that if it improves people's behaviour to imagine somebody watching their every move, that is a useful belief, even if it speaks rather poorly of their personal moral fibre. Such an entity, being imaginary, is unbound by all restraints. But to extend that notion to the physical realm, to present this hypothetical entity as the originator of all we see around us, that places certain demands on what you are proposing. Connecting god to reality, making him part of a chain of events - even if (as discussed in another recent thread) that chain of events occurs outside of what we perceive as time - obliges us to seek once again the first link in that chain, and to expect a damn good reason if it turns out there isn't one.\n \n I apologise for the long delay in formulating this post. It has taken a considerable portion of my day, and I will be unable to reply again this evening. I shall return tomorrow to see what you make of it.",

To me faith and hope in something, as well as belief is not so different. It's all basically the same thing. I think you view faith differently because you think of it as \"religious.\" But from my standpoint there's really not a whole lot of difference between faith in Christ and belief in Christ, or hope in a future event, or faith in a God. To me they are quite interchangeable. in fact, from my perspective you are trying to fragmentize things too much here. I have to argue about faith in the way I see faith: that is, that it pertains to and is (to some extent) most of these things--morality, beliefs, religion, hope, etc. And if that view of things is incompatible with you to such an extent that you can't carry on, so be it. I understand.\n \n \nWhen I speak of faith, I speak of something very specific. When I criticise faith, I criticise the holding of beliefs with unjustifiable fervour; the abandonment of healthy perspective, nothing more.\n\n \n That's a very subjective definition of faith and as such it's not really that specific at all. The very idea that it's unhealthy of the fervor is unjustifiable is completely in the eye of the beholder, and no more than a matter of opinion. You say it's \"unhealthy\" but as I've pointed out several times now, you haven't really demonstrated harm here. You've made a few attempts at slippery slope hypotheticals, but that's about all. And it's as if everytime I bring up an example of faith that's NOT problematic as a rebuttal, you conveniently shift your criteria for faith to not include those things. That's often referred to in discussion as \"moving the goalposts.\"\n \n \nAs an avowed christian you reject belief in a six-day creation entirely thanks to the historical efforts of science; that is the simple truth.\n\n \n I don't deny this at all, nor do I have any problem with it whatsoever. It doesn't rebut anything I believe here. Science rightfully took what was a scientific matter from religion.\n \n \nIt is undeniable that over hundreds of years, science of the real, observable and testable has continued to claim as its own concepts previously believed to be of spiritual, philosophical or supernatural character. Demonic possession, disease, the nature of evil, our biological origins, our perception of morality; the list continues to grow.\n\n \n It is much more complex than that. In some areas (particularly the more empirical ones) it did show that religion was wrong (such as the 6 day creation). In others, it merely provided other possibilities. For instance, the Bible never said that demonic possession and mental illness was the same thing--there is some indication that people in the Bible understood mental illness to some extent, spearately from demonic possession. Science has further helped us understand mental illness, but I know demonic possession is a very real phenomenon. I've seen it. That's the thing; in some cases here I'm not just talking from beliefs of things I've never witnessed. I'm making judgements based on experience because I've seen some of this stuff firsthand. Other things you mention: the nature of evil and perceptions of morality science certainly has not adequately (if at all) addressed. You seem to view science as some sort of force that will supplant religion one day (proving it all wrong); that may make good science fiction, but fiction it is. Religion is as stong or stronger now than it's ever been and is in no way going to disappear anytime soon. There are some things science can't touch simply because science only deals with the empirical.\n \n \nYour alternative interpretation of this one-way transfer of territory, that religion in the past was overstepping its bounds in making statements about the real and testable and that now, in you, it is expressed correctly, ignores the crucial fact that, at the time, people in the past also thought they were correctly delineating the spiritual from the physical. The kinds of observations we can make and the logical and mathematical tools we possess to derive information from them are beyond the wildest dreams of people living a few centuries ago. Who are you to say that trend will not continue? \n\n \n That's not an accurate way of viewing the situation of the last few centuries. Science hasn't, for instance, supplanted prayer. Lots of people still pray, and many scientists believe in God--I'm sure there are good scientists out there that (gasp) pray. Again, I refer you to my statements on religious scientists who made enormous strides. (Some of them would even attribute their success in part to their faith!) The biggest problem with your thinking is that this is only an either/or scenario to you. But in reality, that's not the way the last centuries have played out at all! Science didn't show up as a belief system, nor did it supplant a belief system for most people. It has existed, often peacefully, alongside religion, and continues to do so. And in more cases than not science has not concerned itself with bothering religion. Many doctors, for instance, pray for their patients. It doesn't mean they provide any less medical care! It seems the biggest difference between atheists and most people is that for the atheist science and religion are completely either/or entities. For most people however, they are not. Many religious people agree with science AND maintain religious beliefs. Sure, that's a change from the way it was centuries ago but not in the sense that one supplanted the other. It's just that science has been added alongside as a way of looking and interpreting the universe works. No matter what you think the future holds, one thing is absolutely certain: science and religion can operate together, because they do all the time. It's not always a case of competing belief systems, because science isn't a belief system. Religion is no worse the wear due to science, and science is no worse the wear due to religion. The only time there is a problem is when one crosses into the others' territory: such as when science tries to be morality, or when religion tries to be science.\n \n \nI don't mind if you believe in god, the FSM, or little faeries, provided you have a head on your shoulders when it comes to evaluating your level of confidence in those beliefs, your judgement of how important they are and the scope of their application, because it is that that determines whether or not a belief becomes dangerous - especially in terms of spreading, causing harm to others, or becoming touchpaper for ideological/religious conflict. \n\n \n Then you have nothing to worry about. But this is change from your earlier stances where you seemed to be opposed to ANY belief in God because you viewed it as irrational.\n \n \nEvery incidence of harm being done in the name of religion - or non-theistic ideologies, such as Stalin's communism or even contemporary democracy - can be traced to the adoption and spread of fanatically held belief.\n\n \n Fanatically-held belief alone is not the same as religious faith. A scientist can fanatically believe in a scientific principle. Now it is YOU who are treating two separate matters as \"interchangeable.\"\n \n \nAccording to religion, however, investing a great deal of emotion and ego in holding fast to beliefs is a virtue, regardless of - and in some cases deliberately in spite of - the level of confidence reason would attach to them.\n\n \n Again, this is more complex and not so simple as you are making it out to be. It depends on the religion and the religion group. Some would only invest in holding fast to beliefs in cases where it matters--such as in issues that do not impede upon empirical or scientific matters. It's one thing to stubbornly hold fast to the idea that the universe was created in 6 days; it's another altogether to hold fast to the idea that we should love our enemies, or that humankind has a soul. (And please don't move the goalposts here again and say those cases are not what you're talking about. You began by opposing 'faith', not just bad faith. From religion's standpoint, both can be exmaples of faith.) \n \n \nI have yet to see any evidence that unjustified levels of confidence in one's beliefs leads to good deeds\n\n \n Confidence in one's beliefs doesn't lead to the deeds, nor did I say it did. But certainly the beliefs themselves do.\n \n \n3. What I do ask of beliefs is much less rigorous: only that they have rational value, or at the very least, that the fervour with which they are held and defended be proportional to that value.\n\n \n Then you make an unreasonable request. Again, without harm demonstrated, I see no reason to expect faith to be conducted by some rational value.\n \n \nNow can you see why psychology is on my side? The hope of an afterlife can be a comfort: that is an observable, rational benefit. It does some good. You do not need to be religious to entertain that hope; I admitted as much myself. You certaintly do not need faith, either; I do not believe to any degree at all in an afterlife - but I can always hope I'm wrong :)\n\n \n I'm not talking about mere \"hope\" in an afterlife, I'm talking about religious belief in an afterlife. That's what I'm referring to when I say that psychology validate's religion's value in this case. (Though to me, there's not a lot of difference anyway, but I'll go with the distinction since you've insisted there is a definite distinction.)\n \n \nSo there we have it. I hope now you can appreciate my true standpoint.\n\n \n I appreciate it and understand it. But I think it is unrealistic and overdemanding.",

   "Late edit for brevity.\n \n \nI think this is because I view faith in a much more broad way that you seem to.\n\n \n I appreciate that the word 'faith' has several uses. What I made clear in my previous post, however, is what I am critical of, which is holding beliefs with rationally unjustified fervour. If you prefer, I can use a different word, though it seems to me that 'faith' fits perfectly well.\n \n [/QUOTE] And it's as if everytime I bring up an example of faith that's NOT problematic as a rebuttal, you conveniently shift your criteria for faith to not include those things.

It doesn't rebut anything I believe here.\n\n \n This is a perfectly straightforward, simple matter. Religion believed our origins to be spiritual; science proved they were natural. Arguing now that they always were natural is rather facile; yes, of course they always were natural. Religion was wrong to claim our origins as its territory; what else is it wrong about now? I don't know, and neither do you. The difference is, I don't pretend to.\n \n \nOther things you mention: the nature of evil and perceptions of morality science certainly has not adequately (if at all) addressed.\n\n \n That's quite simply false. Science has proved morality to be independent of religion or the lack of it, and has demonstrated its rational value - that is, why natural selection would have favoured it over selfishness. We need not invoke spirituality to explain it. 'Evil' is, if anything, even better understood.\n \n \nThere are some things science can't touch simply because science only deals with the empirical.\n\n \n Your (potential) error is double-edged. There may be no significant (ie, non-imaginary) matters which aren't empirical, or there may be no matters at all which aren't empirical. You are not in a position to assert otherwise with any confidence.\n \n As I have said already, the bolded text above is the link between this aspect of the discussion and my central point.\n \n \nThe biggest problem with your thinking is that this is only an either/or scenario to you.\n\n \n I refer you to my post above where I explicitly say this is not the case. Please stop assigning opinions to me! What troubles me is faith, as defined above: holding beliefs with unwarranted fervour and emotion. They don't even need to be theistic beliefs, also as I explicitly stated in my post above. The link with religion is that religion encourages unwarranted fervour and emotion.\n \n \nThen you have nothing to worry about. But this is change from your earlier stances where you seemed to be opposed to ANY belief in God because you viewed it as irrational.\n\n \n No, that was what you kept trying to make out I had said. I do view belief in god as irrational, and I will happily debate that issue all day, but it is not belief in god specifically that I deem harmful.\n \n \nFanatically-held belief alone is not the same as religious faith.\n\n \n I know, jyoshu; why do you think I spent a whole day spelling out the meaning of 'faith' that I was criticising? Your 'faith' is christianity. You have 'faith' that certain hypotheses it describes are true. Two meanings of faith.\n \n \nA scientist can fanatically believe in a scientific principle. Now it is YOU who are treating two separate matters as \"interchangeable.\"\n\n \n Oh come on, jyoshu, you're not stupid. I've clearly and explicitly described what troubles me about faith, and pointed out that religion advocates it. Science does not. The scientist you describe - assuming the scientific principle is not sufficiently well proven to warrant his belief - is wrong, and in danger of causing harm. But science doesn't say he's a good boy for being a strong believer. Religion does. \n \n \nit's another altogether to hold fast to the idea that we should love our enemies, or that humankind has a soul.\n\n \n Is it? Well, let's see. Does the belief that we should love our enemies have rational value? Actually yes; it has shades of Game Theory about it. It teaches you to understand your enemies rather than demonise them. It recognises that your enemies are human too, and that refraining from hating and demonising them will make it less likely for them to hate and demonise you in return. It is a recipe for defusing conflict and achieving compromise. It's a belief that works. One does not need to 'hold fast' to such a belief for lack of evidence; it is demonstrably worthy. It's just a pity George W. seems to have forgotten all about it.\n \n As for us having a soul - dualist philosophy, and linked to the existence of an afterlife - that's entirely unsupported by evidence. By all means believe in it, but I'd rather you didn't believe in it so absolutely that you are willing to cut short this life for yourself or anyone else. As my wife said today when I told her about this discussion: although you may buy a lottery ticket for Saturday, you don't quit your job on the Friday.\n \n Are you starting to see how this works? \n \n \nConfidence in one's beliefs doesn't lead to the deeds, nor did I say it did.\n\n \n Yes it does, jyoshu. The more sure I am about something, the more likely I am to act upon it. And you're skipping over, yet again, the word unwarranted, and its implications for a deed carried out in the name of a belief.\n \n Either answer the point, or admit you have none to give.\n \n \nAgain, without harm demonstrated,\n\n \n Pick an atrocity anywhere in the world and you will find fanatical, unwarranted belief at its heart. Pick a violent ideological conflict anywhere in the world and you will find - often quite silly and meaningless - beliefs treasured and revered more than the life of other human beings. Pick any religion in the world, and it will teach you that unwarranted, emotional conviction in your beliefs is a good thing.\n \n I'm disappointed that after all my time and effort, you're still trying to send us around the same tired circles. I've stated my case; either answer it or don't.",

There has clearly been a backpedaling here on your part, or else you started very generally and then moved to the narrow, and so maybe you just had trouble expressing the specifics of your view early on. If you don't believe me, I can very easily go back and show you your statements that clearly demonstrate you've narrowed the scope of your arguments over the course of this discussion; that is a good thing because either a.) you've changed your views somewhat, or b.) you've shown your views were not so broadly damning to begin with as you demonstrated early on--either case is good. You seem frustrated by this observation but I'm not trying to irritate you here, nevertheless it certainly IS an observation I've made, and I can assure you that I can back it up with your posts and statements showing the pattern if need be. So unless that's a road you want to go down, I suggest accepting that your arguments have changed, the goalposts have moved (for whatever reason) and moving on. To me it looks like your arguments changed just so slightly as we've went along to move those goalposts, but for the sake of civility I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt that there are other reasons for the shifting of your arguments.\n \n \nThis is a perfectly straightforward, simple matter. Religion believed our origins to be spiritual; science proved they were natural. Arguing now that they always were natural is rather facile; yes, of course they always were natural. Religion was wrong to claim our origins as its territory; what else is it wrong about now? I don't know, and neither do you. The difference is, I don't pretend to.\n\n \n And I've said, more than once now, that religion was wrong. But your stance assumes religion will repeat it's errors in the future (else why would you be concerned). I don't pretend to know either, and as you've asked of me, I too ask that you not assert an opinion to me that I don't have.\n \n \nThat's quite simply false. Science has proved morality to be independent of religion or the lack of it\n\n \n No, it has proved morality CAN be, depending on the person. I'm demonstrating to you that religion provides morality if people want to turn to it for thus. I'm not trying to say here that religion is the only answer.\n \n \nAs I have said already, the bolded text above is the link between this aspect of the discussion and my central point. (\"You are not in a position to assert otherwise with any confidence\").\n\n \n I don't see that it matters. (shrug) From my perspective, even if there's the mere possibility that there are issues that aren't empirical out there, that's good enough to assume religion is ok. \n \n \nI know, jyoshu; why do you think I spent a whole day spelling out the meaning of 'faith' that I was criticising? Your 'faith' is christianity. You have 'faith' that certain hypotheses it describes are true. Two meanings of faith.\n\n \n Look Peeling, you're the one who just said that cases of communism and Stalinism, even if non-religious, was an irrational belief system, and you did so in the same context as irrational religion. If you don't want me to point out the difference, don't make such a point. You're using non-religious examples in the context of religious faith, then you come back and tell me you've spent a day telling me the meaning of faith you're criticizing. If you know there's a difference, and that's not what you mean to say, then I don't see why you brought up the idea of Stalinism. You started this whole thing out arguing against religious faith--it's that simple. You've changed it to faith in a different sense that includes non-religious cases, if it's unwavering dogma. That's fine, and I can agree with that (though I don't agree with you that religious faith HAS to be that).\n \n \nIs it? Well, let's see. Does the belief that we should love our enemies have rational value? Actually yes; it has shades of Game Theory about it.\n\n \n But in this case the rational value exists alongside the religious view of it. (And I'd argue that part of the reason religion promotes it is because it IS rational--it simply makes sense). IOW, just because a given belief happens to be rational to some extent doesn't make it any LESS religious or faith-oriented.\n \n \nAs for us having a soul - dualist philosophy, and linked to the existence of an afterlife - that's entirely unsupported by evidence. By all means believe in it, but I'd rather you didn't believe in it so absolutely that you are willing to cut short this life for yourself or anyone else. As my wife said today when I told her about this discussion: although you may buy a lottery ticket for Saturday, you don't quit your job on the Friday.\n\n \n Who on earth said anything about \"cutting life short\" over it here??? That came from nowhere, and has no bearing here--you're using a paranoid parade of slippery slopes to argue; you're arguing against something based on what could possibly happen. Most people who believe in the afterlife have no intention of cutting short their lives or anyone else's! If this is seriously a fear of yours about faith, you can rest easy for goodness' sake! Religious people generally don't do that sort of thing. Some fundamentalists, in some religions do (as in radical Islam) but that certainly does not reflect on everyone who has belief in the afterlife!\n \n \nYes it does, jyoshu. The more sure I am about something, the more likely I am to act upon it.\n\n \n Utter tripe, Peeling. No, it does not! It's just not that simple. I am very sure about many things. I have no intention of acting on them.\n \n \nPick an atrocity anywhere in the world and you will find fanatical, unwarranted belief at its heart. Pick a violent ideological conflict anywhere in the world and you will find - often quite silly and meaningless - beliefs treasured and revered more than the life of other human beings. Pick any religion in the world, and it will teach you that unwarranted, emotional conviction in your beliefs is a good thing.\n\n \n Oh my! Think about what you're saying here. Your conclusion here assumes completely fallacious thinking: that because atrocities happen and \"fanatical unwarranted belief\" is behind them, that \"fanatical unwarranted belief\" leads to atrocities. If you don't think that, I doubt you'd have made the point that way. And as a result of that your conclusions are that \"fanatical unwarranted belief\" is bad. Do you know what post hoc ergo propter hoc means, and the significance of the concept in argumentation? Let's be very clear here and nip this in the bud before it gets too out of hand--just because \"any religion in the world\" ... \"will teach you that unwarranted, emotional conviction in your beliefs is a good thing\" does not mean bad things will come about as a result. Now I suspect your next point would be that \"but the potential is there\" and \"it COULD happen\". Sure, anything COULD happen. But I'm not interested in throwing the baby out with the bathwater and saying that all unwavering faith has to be eliminated due to the potential of someone causing harm over it. You may be, but I assure you that you're going to be in the vast minority on that one. (there's a reason for that: it's that such an idea of eliminating all unwaveringness of belief because of the possibility of someone abusing it is itself irrational. Again, what of all the people who will never abuse anyone due to unwaveringness?)\n \n I also note that you're using a term \"fanatical\" to illustrate unwaveringness of belief, and those two concepts are not necessarily the same. Yet again, this is a very complex matter, and people have many degrees of this sort of thing. At what point does unwavering become fanatical anyway?",

   "No. First you opposed \"religion\", then you narrowed it faith, then you narrowed it to faith in cases of harm, then you narrowed it to the concept of holding fast to views (dogmaticism) with unwarranted fervor.\n\n \n Here's a quote from me on the 13th January this year (I finally found that page):\n \n \nBut from a disinterested perspective, faith increasingly seems like a bad concept - or at least a poor fit for the human psyche. It's an undoubtedly powerful force, but there is nothing mystical or inherently good about it. It's simple recursion: a belief that belief is right. It says nothing about what should be believed, it's just an amplifier for whatever notions a person happens to get into their head. But is it even value-neutral? I don't think it is.\n\n \n I have learned a great deal since then, both from my own research and discussions here. I have also argued against particular beliefs or the practices of particular religions - such argument is mandatory when establishing the rational value of beliefs. I have allowed myself to be distracted onto side issues here by your evasive arguments, but to the root of the issue, faith, you have until very recently made no reply. I'm pleased to see, lower down, that you have seem finally to have run out of wriggle-room. Perhaps now we can make progress.\n \n \nAnd I've said, more than once now, that religion was wrong. But your stance assumes religion will repeat it's errors in the future\n\n \n Perhaps I spoke too soon. You are doing it again: changing my opinion for me. My expressed opinion is not that religion will reassert dominance over established scientific territory (though I hope you'll have the decency to agree that some religions are having a damn good try right now). My expressed opinion is that you cannot say with confidence that some of the issues upon which you currently defer to religion are not already occupying scientific territory. Just as people in the past were wrong, so might you be.\n \n \nNo, it has proved morality CAN be, depending on the person. I'm demonstrating to you that religion provides morality if people want to turn to it for thus.\n\n \n No, jyoshu, not depending on the person. That's the point. Our sense of morality towards others spans all religions and none. There are genuine incorrigables (psychopaths intrinsically incapable of empathy) but most real-world deviation is down to differing in-group, out-group perception.\n \n The situations where religion (as opposed to secular codes of conduct) does demonstrably alter our innate perception of what constitutes good behaviour towards others is divine permission to misbehave: making it permissible to rape, murder and pillage if it's what 'god wants', or if the victim has transgressed 'god's laws' (frequently rather foolish conventions of dress and other habits (pun intended)). We don't need permission - or dictate - from a higher authority to be nice to one another.\n \n \nI'm not trying to say here that religion is the only answer.\n\n \n You're treading a very thin line, jyoshu. Science can't make statements about spiritual matters, but religion isn't the 'only answer' to morality?\n \n \nI don't see that it matters. (shrug) From my perspective, even if there's the mere possibility that there are issues that aren't empirical out there, that's good enough to assume religion is ok. \n\n \n Almost caught me out again. Religion, not faith. Like I already said, by all means entertain irrational beliefs, but do so with your head screwed on, and don't elevate imaginary 'spiritual' significance above real-world considerations.\n \n \nLook Peeling, you're the one who just said that cases of communism and Stalinism, even if non-religious, was an irrational belief system, and you did so in the same context as irrational religion. If you don't want me to point out the difference, don't make such a point. You're using non-religious examples in the context of religious faith, <snip< You started this whole thing out arguing against religious faith\n\n \n The faith I criticise is unwarranted fervour of belief - in any belief, theistic, rational, irrational or otherwise. One can 'have faith' in anything; religion does not have a monopoly on it.\n \n However, I single out religion for criticism for teaching that faith is virtuous.\n \n Shall I just add that to my .sig and be done with it? It would certainly be a more efficient way of getting it into every single post, like I'm having to now :)\n \n \nBut in this case the rational value exists alongside the religious view of it.\n\n \n That's like saying the rational explanation for how a plane flies exists alongside the belief that it's swinging from sky-hooks. \n \n Maybe 'love thine enemy' was a rational deduction, or maybe it was merely a happy accident; either way, we judge its value based on its real-world application. You can claim it's also virtuous by some imaginary god-standard if you like, but so what? You could say that about pretty much anything. Asserting that a belief's 'spiritual significance' outweighs its real-world impact is itself an unjustifiable belief (since the concept of 'spiritual' is inherently imaginary), and holding fast to it can and does cause real-world harm.\n \n \nMost people who believe in the afterlife have no intention of cutting short their lives or anyone else's! \n\n \n I agree that it takes extreme levels of commitment to a belief in the afterlife to overcome a person's instinct for self-preservation. Rather less to believe it's more important to save an African's soul by denying him or her contraception than to save their life by supplying it.\n \n What was it I was saying again? I'm sure it was something about unwarranted fervour of belief being harmful... \n \n \nUtter tripe, Peeling. No, it does not! It's just not that simple. I am very sure about many things. I have no intention of acting on them.\n\n \n Then you can't be all that sure, can you? We act when confident; we hesitate when doubtful. Exactly what are you disagreeing with?\n \n \nOh my! Think about what you're saying here. Your conclusion here assumes completely fallacious thinking: that because atrocities happen and \"fanatical unwarranted belief\" is behind them, that \"fanatical unwarranted belief\" leads to atrocities.\n\n \n I like latin as much as the next guy, but I'm sure you'd agree that it has led to atrocities: the people who commit them firmly believe they are doing the right thing, and they act accordingly; there is a clear chain of causality. \n \n I'm sure you'd also agree it has been the touchpaper for conflict: witness the violence muslim activists were able to whip up by faking cartoons of the prophet (the ones actually printed being rather tame for their purposes).\n \n I'm curious to know what else you think can come of fanatical belief in something with no demonstrable rationale or value. I'm also curious to know what justification you have for teaching that fanatical belief is a good thing full stop, when there's no way of knowing what beliefs a person will decide to adopt.\n \n What's wrong with having a sense of perspective? What's wrong with teaching that having a sense of perspective is a good thing? Can you demonstrate harm there? Of the two philosophies, which is the most likely to cause harm?\n \n \n(there's a reason for that: it's that such an idea of eliminating all unwaveringness of belief because of the possibility of someone abusing it is itself irrational. Again, what of all the people who will never abuse anyone due to unwaveringness?)\n\n \n They'll be the ones firmly holding beliefs that have demonstrable, rational value - such as doing no harm. What's your point?\n \n \nI also note that you're using a term \"fanatical\" to illustrate unwaveringness of belief, and those two concepts are not necessarily the same. Yet again, this is a very complex matter, and people have many degrees of this sort of thing. At what point does unwavering become fanatical anyway?\n\n \n They are not seperate, they are merely value-coloured expressions of the same degree of belief. You describe islamic terrorists as fanatical; they describe themselves as unwavering. Potato, potahto.",

   "My expressed opinion is that you cannot say with confidence that some of the issues upon which you currently defer to religion are not already occupying scientific territory.\n \n \n It doesn't matter, because in cases where it turns out that a religious matter is should be a scientific one, then I would defer to science once that becomes clear.\n \n \nNo, jyoshu, not depending on the person. That's the point. Our sense of morality towards others spans all religions and none.\n\n \n I think you misunderstood. Morality is largely a subjective idea that varies from one person to the next. There is no real overall standard of morality that exists. One person may think it is, for instance, immoral to use expletives, another may not. One person may feel it is moral to drink beer, another may feel it is immoral. Even bigger issues like murder can vary from one person to the next--that's why we have prisons full of people. Secular codes of conduct are not the same as morality. Law and morality are not necessarily the same thing.\n \n \n \nI'm curious to know what else you think can come of fanatical belief in something with no demonstrable rationale or value. \n\n \n Does it really matter?? What if NOTHING comes of it? Is that really so bad? The absence of something bad suffices, as far as I'm concerned. We typically don't discourage behavior based on the idea that it doesn't produce certain results; we allow and accept behavior based on the fact that it doesn't produce bad results. People have to have autonomy, even if the results of their actions are completely neutral.\n \n \nI have allowed myself to be distracted onto side issues here by your evasive arguments, but to the root of the issue, faith, you have until very recently made no reply. I'm pleased to see, lower down, that you have seem finally to have run out of wriggle-room. Perhaps now we can make progress.\n \n Perhaps I spoke too soon. You are doing it again: changing my opinion for me. \n \n Almost caught me out again. Religion, not faith. Like I already said, by all means entertain irrational beliefs, but do so with your head screwed on, and don't elevate imaginary 'spiritual' significance above real-world considerations.\n \n The faith I criticise is unwarranted fervour of belief - in any belief, theistic, rational, irrational or otherwise. One can 'have faith' in anything; religion does not have a monopoly on it.\n\n \n And so you've changed again some on what you're talking about. Peeling, with all due respect, this is getting tiresome. I'm not interested in a conversation where you consistently change the terms and move the goalposts. You keep trying to pretend--or perhaps really believe--we're talking about separate issues here (between faith and religion) and we're not. Almost everytime I engage a concept like religion, you narrow it further or claim you're talking about something different (now it's \"unwarrented fervor of belief\"). No one is trying to change anything here but you; no one is trying to \"wiggle\" or \"distract\" you. These are complex issues with many facets and repercussions to them; forgive me for trying to look at the whole of the matter and all the aspects of it. You've narrowed your scope so much now that you're essentially now talking about something that most religious people would agree with you on, including me! So on that note, I'm done.

   "It doesn't matter, because in cases where it turns out that a religious matter is should be a scientific one, then I would defer to science once that becomes clear.\n\n \n Jolly good.\n \n \nI think you misunderstood. Morality is largely a subjective idea that varies from one person to the next.\n\n \n No, it doesn't. That's what the study showed: as far as how we treat one another is concerned, there is a very high degree of correlation between the moral views of geographically and culturally seperated individuals.\n \n \nOne person may think it is, for instance, immoral to use expletives, another may not. One person may feel it is moral to drink beer, another may feel it is immoral.\n\n \n I'd have said it's more accurate to use words like impolite or detrimental rather than 'moral' to describe these activities. Religion does conflate a lot of amoral issues with morality, usually in an attempt to become the primary source of or conduit for enjoyment, which confuses things somewhat.\n \n \nEven bigger issues like murder can vary from one person to the next--that's why we have prisons full of people.\n\n \n This is covered by variance of in-group/out-group perception, not morality. A lot of murder and violence, for example, is gang related; gang members often behave highly honourably towards one another, but demonise and vilify rival gangs. We rely upon this very aspect of human nature when populating our armed forces (not that I'm saying that's a good thing, merely an observation). Exactly the same variance of perception can be elicited from otherwise healthy, gentle, peaceful children by describing a violent biblical scene with or without the cues informing them of its source.\n \n \nDoes it really matter?? What if NOTHING comes of it? Is that really so bad? The absence of something bad suffices, as far as I'm concerned. We typically don't discourage behavior based on the idea that it doesn't produce certain results; we allow and accept behavior based on the fact that it doesn't produce bad results.\n\n \n This isn't about permission, this is about religion advocating faith - excuse me, unwarranted fervour of belief. If nothing good ever comes of it, and it's frequently and demonstrably harmful and obstructive (which it is), why should religion be allowed to lie about its benefits? We don't allow any other organisation to lie about its products or guidance; why should religion be exempt?\n \n \nYou keep trying to pretend--or perhaps really believe--we're talking about separate issues here (between faith and religion) and we're not.\n\n \nThese are complex issues with many facets and repercussions to them\n\n \n Facets like the subtle difference between having faith (strong belief) and \"the christian faith\" (a religion)? I'm pretty sure it hasn't been me taking arguments applying to one and rebutting them as if they applied to the other.\n \n Like I said, if you don't like me using the word 'faith' to describe 'unwarranted fervour of belief', suggest another and I'll use that instead. I was obviously mistaken when I thought that 'faith' was an apt word to use. I really don't mind, so long as you understand the concept.\n \n \nYou've narrowed your scope so much now that you're essentially now talking about something that most religious people would agree with you on, including me!\n\n \n What a backhanded way to concede! Still, beggars can't be choosers. :)\n \n It would seem I've finally conveyed the scope of my criticism well enough for you to appreciate it - although you could be a little more gracious about it, given the effort I've gone to.\n \n Just to clarify: you agree that it is never beneficial, and often/sometimes harmful to invest a disproportionate degree of confidence and emotion in a belief that has little or no supporting evidence and little or no demonstrable value. Is that correct?\n \n Would you go the extra mile, and say that given the above (and the opening quote of this post), it is wrong for religion to teach that unwavering/fanatical (take your pick) belief is inherently virtuous? Both from a standpoint of safeguarding against over-zealous defence of the beliefs promoted by the religion, and from the larger perspective of ceasing to encourage fanatical adoption of beliefs in general (whether external to the religion or internal minority views, eg christian/islamic fundamentalism)?\n \n I know you think I'm anti-religion, but I'm really not. I am an atheist, and will fiercely argue my corner in any appropriate debate, but that's a seperate issue. My prediction of the dissolution of religion being inevitable in the event of the problems with it being solved is still open to challenge; I base it upon reason and observation, but I'd hesitate to call it conclusive. What I do stand by is my analysis of what the problem is that needs to be fixed. And I'm glad you agree with that analysis.",

(remember, you've set that as your current definition; I'm not going to let you change it!) \n \n \n Jabs like that are rude and unecessary.

Given your documented and repeated mangling of concepts in defence of your stance, I will not let snide insinuations that it was a deliberate strategy on my part pass unremarked.\n \n \nSure I can agree with that.

   "does religion contribute to suicide\n\n \n Suicide is irrelivant.\n \n \n \nChristians obfuscating their Christianity\n\n \n I don't even know what this means.\n \n \n \nis there a qualitative difference between religion and superstition\n\n \n None i can think of.\n \n \n \nFort Worth Pastor indicted on rape\n\n \n Yes, what about it.\n \n [quote]Love of God, Hatred of HumanityFah!! ReligionBlood Red Ribbons with Blobs of Clotted BloodWhy I hate, hate, hate religion!Religious AddictionChristians: leave me alone and leave science aloneNothing fails like prayerThe real cause of all grief (religion, of course)\n \nThe problem is that it's always \"open season\" on religion with skeptics. They claim to support a philosophy of live-and-let-live, but that doesn't seem to apply when it comes to religion. If people want to believe that Christ died for them and is coming back, what the heck is that to you????\n\n \n It is \"to me\" when the religious nut-jobs try to legislate their 2000 year old book. Such as: Pro-Life agenda, Anti-stem cell research, Anti-sodomy laws, and anti-gay discriminatory laws. If you just leave us alone and stick to your wacked beliefs we would be happy.\n \n \n \n \nYou don't want people to be vocal with you, but you can't stand someone else actually having the gall to be vocal about their faith.\n\n \n By all means shut up.\n \n \n \nAnd it's not like skeptics are limiting their criticisms to just those vocal factions rather than all of religion.\n\n \n Most skeptics, philosiphers, atheist, scientists and just plain geniuses usually attack the main religion that is becoming widespread and dangerous: Christianity. We have no problem with you practicing your religion, just don't legislate your twisted views into laws.\n \n \n \nA free exchange of ideas and views requires people to be open to at least listening to other views, on BOTH sides.\n\n \n Both christians and atheists alike have considered their positions carefully and made their descision based on what they think is best. There is nothing more. If people choose not to be open to another idea then you are in no position to force them.\n \n \n \n \nSo given that religion is about the only thing I can think of about which such assertions and comments can be made without detractors being considered the bigots they are, then why would you expect religious people to not defend themselves?\n\n \n Religious XXXXXX are such bigots and hypocrytes that it hardly seems adequate. We have a dominently christian group in power at the moment, and they are practically starting a genocide with the muslims. They have even set up a designated prison in a different country and taken away the muslim's right to privacy and habeus corpus. Religious people are too immersed in their beliefs to see any truth.\n \n \n \n \nI also think it's important to point out that you aren't just dealing with intellectual cold views here. You are dealing with matters that people hold VERY, VERY dear sometimes.\n\n \n And that can be part of the problem.\n \n \n \nWhen skeptics say things to a deeply religious person things like \"nothing fails like prayer\" or \"religion is just superstition\" it's an affront.\n\n \n Where the heck did you get that? That would be becoming what we are fighting all along. A bigot and a hypocryte.\n \n \n \nAnd you know that. So knowing that, why would you want to be intentionally mean? This is something they hold very deeply dear and sacred. I like to bring up the funeral urn to illustrate this. If you were at someone's home and they had a ash urn on the mantle with the ashes of their deceased parent there which they held dear and sacred, would you start making light of it, trying to assert that the ashes don't really mean anything and that their intentions to hold that urn sacred are ridiculous and silly?\n\n \n See above, only XXXXXX are like that.\n \n \n \nWould you tell them that it's just \"superstition\" to want to keep those ashes or believe their loved ones are in heaven?\n\n \n No, but if these people force me to burn a loved one of mine's corpse instead of doing what I think is best then I may get a little angry.\n \n \n \n \nWould you coldly start trying to convince them it's nothing more than the remnants carbon-based combustible material?\n\n \n Only if they force me to burn my grandma, which is very close to whats happening today.\n \n \n \n \nWith religion you are dealing in the realm of matters that billions of people hold very, very dear. So you see, you say you haven't \"offended\" the holder of such beliefs my making such statements, but in fact you have.\n\n \n So dear that they would force all non believers to abide by their religion (I cite the pro-life movement) and repent their sins and become christian (I cite guantanamo bay), and then destroy someone else's \"sacred\" views.\n \n \n \n \n \nCome to think of it, I find it fascinating that we're discussing the idea that some should be allowed to NOT respect views without criticism. I have respect for most ANY opinion. It seems odd to me that anyone would want to be given a free pass to not respect views.\n\n \n \n Then why would you try to legislate only YOUR views into law? Why would you make laws impeding on the innocents liberty? Why would you detain non believers in prisons, and then torture them?\n \n \n Religion isn't so rosy and happy as you paint it to be. 1000 years ago, I would've been tortured, burned, hanged, disemboweled, the works? Did you know that the religious people back then used to stick a tube down someone's throat, dump gallons of water into their stomach so they would blow up like a baloon, then drop a ten pound rock on their stomach to make it all squirt out like a geyser, along with most of their vital organs too. Did you know that the religious wack jobs used to cut someone's stomach open, pull out all of their intestins, and then let them lay there as they watched rats come up and eat their intestins? Did you know that now in guantanamo bay they torture muslims by holding their heads underwater and electrecuting them until they confess? So be careful when you're talking about \"sacredness\" and \"offending these people\".",

As you have pointed out, I know little about Judaism; but I do suspect that such images would be proscribed. Correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n Avoid them at all costs.

I mean, you can be guarenteed the same place in the world to come as me by following your set of laws. Why would a person want to be a Jew and observe all 613 biblical commandments and the thousands of rabbinic commandments?\n \n I agree that chrsitianity has its roots from eliminating a lot of the dietary laws and commandments. However, it's important to realize from a scholarly view that 95-98% of the EARLY converts to christianity were Torah observing Jews. So these Jews have been keeping kashrut and living the same life as the Jews have. However, when trying to convince the gentiles to follow christ, no one in their right mind would want to go from having sex with whomever they want to following the laws of nidah ect... So the gentiles who may have otherwise wanted to join christianity might have not because of the strict laws and lifestyles that they see the Jews living by. What's the easiest way for them to convince people? Maybe drop some of the commandments and turn a blind eye to Devarim 13:1.\n \n \nIt is my thesis that these relaxations, although dressed up as new revelation, were in fact purely pragmatic.

One interpretation is to say that it refers to something that happens at the 2nd coming of Christ.\n \n Another is to say that the verse simply refers to what happened in the nation of Israel once again becoming a nation in the 20th century.\n \n My view (and the one I believe most consistent with the NT) is that Israel as God's people is now a spiritual nation and heritage, that continues on in the church--God's love and atonement available to to whole world rather than just Judaism. And so the verse speaks of the idea that we are all gathered in Christ. It's very figurative.\n\n All three of the interpretations fail to convince me that it's been fullfilled. In the first, you admit that it hasn't come and could come later on. Fine, jesus can't be Messiach with this interpretation. In the second, even if it refers to the nation of Israel, do all the Jews live there? No, they do not, so this prophecy is still not full-filled. In the third interpretation, I ask, are all people gathered in christ? The answer is yet again - no - , there are billions of people who don't believe in christ so it still isn't fullfilled. \n \n With all three interpretations none of them are full-filled. For me to even consider the idea that christ was the jewish messiach, I would need proof that he full-filled the Jewish requirements. Thus far in my life, I have yet to be convinced that jesus fullfilled more requirements then previous Jewish leaders.\n \n \nThe overall Christian view on this is that this prophecy (if you view it as prophecy) hasn't taken place yet. \n\n Well you said above that you view it as a prophecy. Here you say it isn't completed. So how can you say that jesus is the Messiach when he hasn't completed everything by your own admission?\n \n \nYou'll have to be more specific. I don't know what it is you're asking here.\n\n 2nd Samual states that the Messiach will come from the line of David. In Matthew 1 it states the lineage of jesus including that of a man named Jeckonia (SP?). In Jeremiah 22, G-d places a curse on the family of Jeckonia stating that no one from this line will ever sit on the throne again and that they are cut off. So if jesus comes from this line as Matthew says he does, it creates a lot of problems including the lineage of jesus. Of course, if you say that jesus's father is G-d, then I ask you, is G-d a decedent of David? The answer is no. So even if you believe jesus is G-d, which is your choice, you admit at the same time that he is not the Messiach.",

XXXII, 14).And so in many places. For example, He said about Jekoniah: For no man of his seed shall prosper (Jer. XXII, 30) and it says, I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations... In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, My servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the Lord, and will make thee as a signet (Hag. II, 22 f.).

   "Easyrider, \n \n Instead of arguing with you over something you probably haven't fully read or even understand, let's assume you're right.\n \n The curse was 'forgiven'.\n \n Where does this leave us, that Joseph's line can sit on the throne. Correct? Good.\n \n If G-d is the father as you insist, then either 1) G-d is a descendant of King David or 2) if G-d is the father, Jesus is not a descendant of King David. \n \n 1) is obviously wrong. Correct?\n 2) This would make Jesus not Messiah. \n \n If G-d is not the father, and someone else is like... Joseph.

I make absolutely no argument over who may or may not be misguided in their faith and more over - I don't care. I just find the concept of an Evangelical Christian telling Jews about their faith absurd. It would be like watching an auto mechanic tell a brain surgeon how to do his job. Or having someone who has only ever driven a car tell a pilot how to fly a plane. It is arrogant, ludicrous and frankly hysterical. In short - you look like an idiot when you do it - but keep it up, it's fun for me.\n \n \nTheir Messiah has already come. The enlightened Messianic Jews are the ones who have realized that. \n\n \n No - Messianic Jews are Christians. Really this is not rocket science. \n \n \nI'm supposed to be impressed with Trebor's opinion?

Even if you put the truth of the steak up to his nose he will still defend the bone to the death.\nYou appear to be describing yourself...holding on to your bone of contention with relentless claims of persecution of 'your people\". We can put down the most logical of arguments that support heterosexual mating and procreation (the steak) and you will hold to your contempt of such a thought.\n \n \nUnlike you I am willing to live in a world with all the color of diversity. Where each person has their own voice and beliefs. My ideal world is one where you are free to be the type of christian you want to be and I am free to be as gay as I want to be. Live and let live, you do your thing and I do mine. It is when certain groups try and oppress me, my people, and my family that I have to stand up and say no more. When they use the system to make laws based upon their religious beliefs to my debtament and the wellbeing of my family that I have to take action. In short each of us should be free to live as we please and if you take something from me then I have the right to take something from you.\nIs this the same Matthew S that previously claimed that heterosexual couples should not be allowed to display their progeny in public as it offends you?\n \n \nThey are more then welcome as long as they do not create and support laws that adversely effect me, my family, and my people.\n..and who will define \"adverse effect\"?

   "Of Dreams and Blessings - A Christmas Message\n \n Intently studying the new Christmas tree that her mother and father had just erected in their foyer, little Christina slowly walked up to it and was immediately taken with the wonderful aroma of pine cones and winter frost that still lingered on its branches.\n \n \"Mommy, why do people have Christmas trees,\" Christina asked? \n \"Oh, I suppose that the Christmas tree means different things to different people, honey,\" the mother cheerfully replied, as she worked the string of Christmas lights through the branches of the tree. \n \n \"But mommy, what does it mean for us - for you and me and for daddy?\" The child-like innocence of Christina's question made her mother hesitate and stop what she was doing. She turned around and sat down on the floor, crossed her legs and gently lifted little Christina into her lap. \n \"Christina, honey, I don't know what the Christmas tree means to other people, but I can tell you about all the wonderful things I think about when I see one.\" Let me tell you a little story. And starting with the birth of Jesus, she told Christina all the wonderful news about his birth, his life, his death, and his resurrection, and what it all meant. And then to put it into a child's perspective the mother smiled and said,\n \n \"You see, long ago on a mountain top, far, far away, there were three other little trees. And as they started to sprout their branches and reach for the sky, they each dreamed about what they wanted to become when they grew up.\n \n The first tree looked up to the stars and said, 'I want to be a treasure chest. I want to be covered with gold and filled with precious stones. I want to be the most beautiful treasure chest the world has ever seen.'\n The second little tree looked out at the small stream trickling by on its way to the ocean and said, 'I like the water. I want to be a mighty sailing ship carrying kings on their journeys across the seas. Why, I'll be the strongest ship in the whole world!'\n \n The third little tree looked down into the valley below and saw the hustle and bustle in the streets and the hectic pace of the people in the village and said, 'I don't want to leave the mountain top. I really like it here. I want to grow up and be so tall that when people look at me, they'll raise their eyes and look up to heaven and think of God. Why, I'll be the tallest tree in the whole world!' \n \n Years passed. The rains came and the winds blew, the sun shone bright, and the little trees grew tall and strong. And then one day three woodcutters climbed up the mountain.\n \n The first woodcutter looked at the first tree and said, 'This tree is beautiful. I have something special I want to make from it, and it'll be perfect for me.' And with one mighty swoop of his woodcutter's axe, the first tree fell.\n 'Now, the time has come for my dream to come true,' the first tree thought. 'Now I shall be made into a beautiful chest, and surely I shall hold wonderful treasures!' \n \n The second woodcutter looked at the second tree and said, 'This tree is strong. It will be perfect for me.' And with a swing of his powerful axe, the second tree fell to earth. 'Now my dreams also will come true,' thought the second tree. 'I will be hewn into a mighty ship to sail the seas, and great kings will ride my bow!'\n \n But then the third tree felt her heart sink when the third woodcutter looked her way. She stood straight and tall and pointed bravely to the heavens. \n 'Remember, I want to stay on the mountain top, she cried.' But the woodcutter never looked up. 'Any tree will do for me,' he muttered. \n And with a powerful swing of his shining axe, the third tree thundered to the earth.\n \n The first tree continued to rejoice when the woodcutter brought him into the carpenter's shop. But his joy was turned to sorrow when the carpenter fashioned him into a simple feed trough for animals. Instead of being covered with precious gold and jewels, he was now covered with sawdust and filled with hay for hungry farm animals to eat.\n \n The second tree smiled when the woodcutter took her into the shipyard.\n 'Now, my dreams will also come true!' she thought. But no mighty sailing ship was christened that day. Instead the once mighty oak was whittled, hammered, and sawn into a simple fishing boat. She was too small and frail to sail the mighty oceans, or navigate the raging rivers. Instead, crestfallen, she was taken to a lake, and there she would spend her days.\n \n The third tree was confused when the woodcutter cut into her strong and weathered timbers, and left her in a cluttered woodpile in the lumberyard.\n 'What happened?' asked the tree that once pointed to the heavens. 'All I ever wanted was to grace the top of the mountain and point to God...'\n \n Again, the years passed by. The dreams the little trees once had were nearly forgotten. But then, something wonderful happened. In the distance, the angels were heard singing to the shepherds. A bright and shining star began its transit across the heavens, and came to its place of rest above the hewn out timbers of the first tree, where a beautiful young mother placed her newborn son into the feedbox.\n \n 'I wish I had time to make a cradle for him,' the father whispered. The mother gently squeezed his hand and smiled as the starlight glistened off the smooth and sturdy wood. 'Why this manger is beautiful,' she said. 'There is no need for another.'\n \n And suddenly, the first tree knew that God had honored his dream, and that he was now holding the greatest and most precious treasure in the whole world. 'God sure works in mysterious ways,' he thought, 'but this is better than anything I could have ever imagined.'\n \n Some years later, a kindly stranger and his friends crowded into an old fishing boat. The weary traveler fell asleep as the second tree quietly sailed out upon the moonlit lake. But soon, a terrible storm arose. The rains came, the winds grew fierce, and time after time the waves crashed into the little boat, sending it reeling from side to side. The little tree shuddered and grew afraid. She knew she did not have the strength to carry so many passengers through such a raging storm. Then, the kind but tired traveler awoke. He took hold of the mastline and stood up on the bow of the little vessel, stretched out his hand, and said, 'Peace, be still.' The storm stopped as quickly as it had begun. And suddenly, the second tree knew that she was carrying the greatest King who had ever lived, and that in some mysterious way, God had also made her dreams come true.\n \n Shortly thereafter, early on a Friday morning, the third tree was startled when her beams were yanked from the forgotten woodpile. She flinched when she was carried through an angry, jeering crowd. She shuddered when the soldiers nailed the arms and feet of a weary and bleeding man to her cross timbers. She felt ugly, cruel, and harsh. In the middle of the day, the sky turned dark. And when it was over, a terrible earthquake shook the ground, and made the third little tree long for the peace and serenity of its favorite mountain top, and the now-forgotten dreams that seemed so real, not so long ago.\n \n But early on a Sunday morning, when the sun rose and the earth trembled with joy beneath her, the third little tree looked upon the risen Savior, and rejoiced that God's mysterious love had now changed everything. The third tree remembered her dream - 'I want to grow so tall that when people stop to look at me, they'll raise their eyes to heaven and think of God.' It made the tree glad. Now, whenever people think of that third little tree, they think of God. And surely that was better than being the tallest tree in the whole world.\"\n \n \"So you see, Christina, God really does make dreams come true, though not always in the ways we expect. When I look at a Christmas tree, I remember the birth of Christ. I see the first little tree that was made into a manger. I remember the second little tree that our Savior rode in and calmed the great storm that rose up. And I remember that last little tree upon which our Lord was crucified, and how precious it also was. These are the things I think about when I see a Christmas tree.\"\n \n God bless!",

   "\"Remember to welcome strangers, because some who have done this have welcomed angels without knowing it.\" \n \n The Cobbler and His Guest\n \n Now there lived in the city of Marseilles, a hundred years ago, an old shoemaker, who was loved and honored by all his neighbors, who affectionately called him \"Father Martin.\" One Christmas eve he sat alone in his little shop, reading about the visit of the wise men to the infant Jesus, and of the gifts that they brought him. So the cobbler said to himself, \"If tomorrow were the first Christmas, and if Jesus were to be born in Marseilles this night, I know what I would give him!\" He rose and took from a shelf two little shoes of the softest snow-white leather, with bright, silver buckles. \"I would give him these, my finest work. How pleased his mother would be!\" But then, as he turned around to place them back on the shelf, he thought to himself, But I'm a foolish old man. The Master has no need of my poor gifts.\n \n After replacing the shoes, he blew out his candle and retired to his bed. He had barely closed his eyes when he heard a voice softly call his name. \"Martin!\" Intuitively, he felt that it was the Lord who was speaking to him. \"Martin,\" the voice said, \"You have longed to see me. Tomorrow I shall pass by your window. If you see me and bid me to enter, I shall be your guest and sit at your table.\"\n \n Father Martin was electrified. He didn't sleep that night in anticipation of what was ahead. Before it was dawn he got up and tidied up his little shop. He swept the floor and put boughs of holly and fir along the rafters. On the table he placed a loaf of freshly baked bread, a jar of honey, a pitcher of milk; and over the fire he hung a caldron of hot chocolate. His simple preparations were complete.\n \n When all was in readiness, he took up his vigil at the window. He was sure he would know the Master when he came. As he watched the driving sleet and snow, he thought about how cold it was outside, but how warm and joyous it would be when the Master finally came.\n \n Presently, he saw an old street sweeper pass by, blowing upon his thin and gnarled hands to keep them warm. That poor fellow! He must be half frozen. Opening the door, Father Martin called out to him, \"Come in, my friend, and get warm, and I'll give you something hot to drink.\" No further urging was needed, and the man gratefully accepted the invitation.\n \n Another hour passed by, and Father Martin then saw a poor, miserably clothed woman carrying her baby. Stung by the cold winter blast, she paused, wearily, to rest in the shelter of his doorway. Quickly, he flung open the door and said, \"Come in from the cold. My shop is warm, and you can rest.\" She replied, \"I am going to the hospital. I'm hoping that they will take me and the baby in. My husband is away at sea, and I am ill, with no other place to go.\" \"You poor child!\" cried the old man. \"You must eat something while you are getting warm. And let me get a cup of warm milk for the little one. Ah!. What a bright and cheerful little fellow he is! Why, you have no shoes on him!\" \"I cannot afford to buy him anything,\" sighed the mother.\n \"Then he shall have this lovely pair I finished yesterday,\" the cobbler said. And with that Martin took down from the shelf the soft, little snow-white shoes with the silver buckles he had looked at the night before, and slipped them onto the child's feet. They fit perfectly. Shortly thereafter, when mother and child had been rested and refreshed, they went their way full of gratitude for what Father Martin had done for them, and Martin returned to his vigil at the window sill.\n \n Hour after hour went by, and one by one, many other needy travelers shared the meager hospitality of the old cobbler, but the expected guest, the Master, did not appear.\n \n At last, when night had fallen, Father Martin retired to his cot with a heavy heart. \"It was only a dream,\" he sighed. \"I did hope and believe, but the Master did not come.\"\n \n Suddenly, or so it seemed to his weary eyes, the room was filled with a warm, glorious light; and to the cobbler's astonishment, there, in a vision before him, appeared the street sweeper, the sick mother and her baby, and all the people whom he had given comfort to that day. One by one, they all smiled at him and said, \"Have you not seen me? Did I not sit at your table?\" And suddenly they vanished.\n \n Then softly out of the silence and the glorious light he heard again the gentle voice that he had heard the night before, saying, \"Whoever receives one such child as this in my name receives me.\" (Matt 18:5) \"For I was hungry and you gave me food; I was thirsty and you gave me drink; I was a stranger and you took me in. Verily I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it also to Me.\" (Matt 25:35-40).\n \n This Christmas season, let the gifts that we give to each other not necessarily be found beneath the Christmas trees of our homes, but let them be the gifts of love and compassion that we shower on each other. For surely with these presents we honor our Lord and Savior.\n \n Until we meet again, may the Lord bless you and keep you, and may his love and light shine upon you all the days of your lives. Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night. Amen.\n \n (from \"Chicken Soup for the Christian Soul\")",

   "What's the objective basis for your morality values? And moral in whose eyes, yours or God's?\n\n \n \"Objective basis for morality\" is code for thinking that the Bible is the basis for morality. Stop asking me about God or his eyes or any other part. That has no meaning to me. The morality described in the bible is manmade because it was written by humans, who may or may not have believed that they were inspired by a non-existant deity. Claiming there is some \"objective\" morality is merely a smokescreen for claiming a moral superiority. There is no such thing. Nothing could be more subjective. And that by NO MEANS suggests there is no such thing as right and wrong. \n \n A great side effect of using one's selective interpretation of the Bible as a rigid, objective, black/white guide to morality is one can proscribe against those little sins that hurt no one, but the tight-asssed Puritans can still rail against them (even though they commit them as much as anyone.) That way you can concentrate enormous amounts of wasted energy with your prurient interest in people's private lives. \n \n All humans have adopted codes of morality passed on from generation to generation.

Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus,etc. These examples do not typically represent people without values or conscience. As for humbleness, you haven't the slightest idea of what that word means in relation to other people. People who have lives that all theirs and theirs alone, not yours. You may be humble to the god of your choosing, but you have forgotten that your god is a result of your belief and your subjective supernatural experiences. Which puts you in a position of being equal with all the other people who believe in other gods, based on their belief and their supernatural experieces. Those reasons you have used for denying Christ can be thrown right back at you for your denial of someone elses god. Why is okay for you to deny Allah, or Yaweh, or Buddah, or even Appollo, but not okay for others to deny Christ? \"Just because\" your faith based belief is right and everyone elses is wrong is not an acceptable answer.\n Humanity has been playing a bloody and devisive game of \"To tell the Truth\" for as far back as history goes. \"To tell the Truth\" in case you are not an old man like me, was a game show where 5 different people would claim to be somebody or something. The panelists would ask the 5 different people certain questions relavent to their claims. Based on their answers and level of comfort with the questions the panelists would decide who was telling the truth. At the end of the match the announcer would say \"Would the real (example) blacksmith please stand up?\" The panelists who chose the real blacksmith were the winners. It was a very simple premise. The problem with humans playing this game with god is the cold hard fact that he doesn't appear before the human race to provide answers to questions. He never rises when humanity asks, pleads, and/or begs \"Will the real God please stand up?\" Until that day comes please try to refrain from pulling rank on those who have a different theory on what life is all about. And until that day you cannot say who is right or wrong in their belief or lack there of. Acceptance of what you have not the power to change is a blessing. Can you imagine if we held the power to change people into thinking the way we wanted them to? For thousands of years there have been people who truly believe that they do have the power to change the way people think, and it only leads to misery. Try not to wrong people for not believing in Christ, unless you are willing to wrong yourself for not believing in their gods. Are you willing to take that step? Are you willing to put yourself on a level playing field? A playing field where the rules cannot be changed to fit your agenda and a victory cannot be claimed on your assumption that you are right and everyone else is wrong. Is it the love of Jesus you truly believe in? Or do you get a feeling of power because you think you have something that everyone else needs, whether they realize it or not? The aggressiveness that you display when you sarcastically dismiss other peoples beliefs make me question your reasons for your relationship with Jesus. Your posts illustrate a boastful arrogance that is counter productive to spiritual growth.",

If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses (note Deuteronomy 19:15). If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector .\"\n \n I Corinthians 5:13: \"Are you not to judge those inside (the church)? God will judge those outside. Expel the wicked man from among you.\"\n \n I Corinthians 6:4: \"Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, appoint as judges even men of little account in the church.\"\n \n (also note 2 Thessalonians 3:6-15).\n \n God commands us to judge according to one's 'fruits.'\n \n Matthew 7:17-20: \"Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.....every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.\"\n \n Saints of Christ will judge the world, and angels:\n \n I Corinthians 6:2: \"Do you not know that the saints will judge the world?\"\n \n I Corinthians 6:3: \"Do you not know that we will judge angels?\"\n \n Jesus condemned the teachers of the law and the Pharisees:\n \n Matthew 23:27-28: \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.\"\n \n John the Baptist rebukes King Herod for adultery and other sins:\n \n Luke 3:19: \"But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other things he had done, Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.\" \n \n Stephen rebukes the Jewish leaders:\n \n Acts 7:51-53: \"You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit! Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him - you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it.\" \n \n Also note all the Old Testament prophets who condemned sin and corrupt moral leadership, and who were persecuted for their discernment and duty.\n \n Finally, when someone accuses you of being judgmental, are they not being critical and judgmental in making that accusation?",

I don't demand that anyone accepts my view, I just ask them to think it through and then object reasonably, if that's what they want to do. Where on this forum have I demanded anyone accept my viewpoint, on the strength of just my word? I'm not the one being a hypocrite here. I was merely pointing out the hypocracy of your position (the 'you're too set in your ways, when you should be more like me' position). gaetano saw that, but maybe you can't.\n \n \nWell, Matthew says he's a Christian, but he wants to rewrite the Bible and not be renewed in the ways of Christ. \n\n \n Does Christ himself comment on homosexuality? I don't recall that he does. If he does, then there is basis for the doctrine (at least depending on how you accept Biblical doctrine). If he doesn't, then the basis of that particular dogma is sketchy at best. I thought Christ was meant to be forgiving and loving? Surely someone who is forgiving and loving will be able to accept that some people are different?\n \n \nWe're not talking about your \"anything goes\" moral relativism here.\n\n \n As before, I like the speed with which you attempt to dismiss my moral code, even though you know squat about it. I'm merely calling you on being a hypocrite.\n \n \nIs writing the truth being biased? Or are those who think the opposite, such as yourself, biased against it?\n\n \n Many of the truths we cling to in this life, depend greatly on our own point of view..... (Couldn't resist it). \n \n You're convinced that you are the only one who knows the truth, and that the rest of us are biased against you (nice bit of Christian humility there btw). Having heard that before so many times that it makes me yawn every time now, I'll let it slide. The fact that you have decided to swallow Biblical doctrine without asking questions like that indicates at least that you don't study history.\n \n \nYour fallacy lies in thinking God created people gay. And you base that on what? \n\n \n On the (actually pre-)Christian idea that God creates each person and knows the intimate details of thier heart and soul. Given that some people are (for want of a better word) 'just' gay, without any conscious decision making involved, that must have been how they were created, or are you implying that God doesn't know it all? Or maybe that He slipped up?\n \n \nThere's zero scriptural support for it. Nowhere in the Bible is a gay-sex relationship approved by God. To the contrary, gay sex is a sin.\n\n \n No it's not approved, and it is described as a sin. The blood and anger part of the Bible happily aims itself at homosexuals as well as women and lepers.\n \n \nAlso note all the Old Testament prophets who condemned sin and corrupt moral leadership, and who were persecuted for their discernment and duty\n\n \n I think someone is trying to cast himself in the 'persecuted prophet' mould. I'm not quite sure what the scripture was meant to prove, other than the fact that Christians are duty-bound to spend thier existances persecuting those who don't fit in. (Funny that!)\n \n \nFinally, when someone accuses you of being judgmental, are they not being critical and judgmental in making that accusation?\n\n \n It rather depends on what they say. (Is it me, or do the words 'out-of-context' and Bible bashing seem to go hand in hand?).\n \n If you have shown that you are judging all and sundry with no regard for individual personality, then calling you judgemental would merely be making a factual statement. If you were merely making a post, or did not have a history of juding book by its cover, then accusing you would be both judgemental and innaccurate.",

   " Actually I haven't demanded that you see the world as I do. I don't demand that anyone accepts my view, I just ask them to think it through and then object reasonably, if that's what they want to do. Where on this forum have I demanded anyone accept my viewpoint, on the strength of just my word? I'm not the one being a hypocrite here. I was merely pointing out the hypocracy of your position (the 'you're too set in your ways, when you should be more like me' position). gaetano saw that, but maybe you can't.\n\n \n If you want to be tolerant you will need to accept people's rights to espouse Biblical viewpoints that don't agree with your viewpoints. Otherwise you're just as much a bigot or hypocrite as you claim those of us who hold to the Bible are. Are you going to be \"tolerant\" of our right to proclaim religious, Biblical beliefs, or shall we mail in our right to free speech to the nearest political correctness bureau?\n \n \n Does Christ himself comment on homosexuality? I don't recall that he does. If he does, then there is basis for the doctrine (at least depending on how you accept Biblical doctrine). If he doesn't, then the basis of that particular dogma is sketchy at best. I thought Christ was meant to be forgiving and loving? Surely someone who is forgiving and loving will be able to accept that some people are different?\n\n \n See my previous post on these two issues.\n \n \n \n You're convinced that you are the only one who knows the truth, and that the rest of us are biased against you (nice bit of Christian humility there btw). Having heard that before so many times that it makes me yawn every time now, I'll let it slide. The fact that you have decided to swallow Biblical doctrine without asking questions like that indicates at least that you don't study history.\n\n \n \"without asking questions\"? LOL. Where did you dream that one up? I've asked thousands of them and studied the Bible for many, many years. Are you swallowing the secular humanist position while casually dismissing the Word of God? And doesn't your secular humanism teach that \"I'm okay, you're ok\"? \n \n \n On the (actually pre-)Christian idea that God creates each person and knows the intimate details of thier heart and soul. Given that some people are (for want of a better word) 'just' gay, without any conscious decision making involved, that must have been how they were created, or are you implying that God doesn't know it all? Or maybe that He slipped up?\n\n \n Since the \"fall\" the universe has been in disarray (according to the Bible). There's a number of scientific studies that speak of abnormal chemical imbalances in the mother's womb, which arguable influence \"gayness\". There's no indication God is the one behind that. \n \n \n I'm not quite sure what the scripture was meant to prove, other than the fact that Christians are duty-bound to spend thier existances persecuting those who don't fit in. (Funny that!)\n\n \n Another unfortunate \"twist.\" Not persecuting, just calling people to repentance and salvation, just as numerous individuals in the Bible have done.",

Its circulation increases, and it is more loved and cherished and read today than ever before. Infidels, with all their assaults, make about as much impression on this book as a man with a tack hammer would on the Pyramids of Egypt. \n \n \"When the French monarch proposed the persecution of Christians in his dominion, an old statesman and warrior said to him, 'Sire, the church of God is an anvil that has worn out many hammers.' So the hammers of infidels have been pecking away at this book for ages, but the hammers are worn out, and the anvil still endures. If this book had not been the book of God, men would have destroyed it long ago. Emperors and popes, kings and priests, princes and rulers have all tried their hand at it; they die and the book still lives.\"\n \n \"No other book has been so chopped, knived, sifted, scrutinized, and vilified. What book on philosophy or religion or psychology or belles lettres of classical or modern times has been subject to such a mass attack as the Bible? With such venom and skepticism? With such thoroughness and erudition? Upon every chapter, line and tenet? The Bible is still loved by millions, and studied by millions.\n \n http://www.forerunner.com/forerunner/X0002_Anvil.html\n \n \n WRONG! You are twisting the word \"sin\" to fit your values. A sin is an act that unnecessarily hurts another life. That doesn't mean all hurting of lives is a sin, but when it is completely unnecessary and based on hate, yes, it is.\n\n \n There are eternal consequences to unrepentant sin. Reckon that's not in your vocabulary. And what's really \"hateful\" is to slap a sinner on his back and encourage / defend / legitimize his or her sin so they eventually wind up in serious trouble at the Judgment.

Otherwise you're just as much a bigot or hypocrite as you claim those of us who hold to the Bible are. Are you going to be \"tolerant\" of our right to proclaim religious, Biblical beliefs, or shall we mail in our right to free speech to the nearest political correctness bureau?\n\n \n I love this. This is a wonderful example of the persecution complex of religious types. Show me where I have denied your right to say these things. I have argued with you, but that's not persecution. If you want to hold and espouse these views, then I won't try to stop you even though I do disagree with them.\n \n Nice attempt to change the subject by the way. I'm not attacking your rights, I'm merely pointing out that you are being hypocritical to attack Matthew for his beliefs merely on the strength of yours.\n \n \nSee my previous post on these two issues.\n\n \n I think ShadowPikachu covered this issue well, and you clearly aren't prepared to accept it. Ah well.\n \n \n\"without asking questions\"? LOL. Where did you dream that one up? I've asked thousands of them and studied the Bible for many, many years. Are you swallowing the secular humanist position while casually dismissing the Word of God? And doesn't your secular humanism teach that \"I'm okay, you're ok\"?\n\n \n Again you're summing people up with little or no evidence. I actually commented on you analysing the circumstances of the Bible's creation. You've asked questions of the scripture, but it seems that you haven't asked questions of the historical context. Not being entirely clear what you mean by 'secular humanism', I can't tell you what it teaches. I have merely seen the posative and negative effects of religion and studied history. And before you go off on one I had an upbringing which involved church services and biblical teachings. I made my own mind up.\n \n \nSince the \"fall\" the universe has been in disarray (according to the Bible). There's a number of scientific studies that speak of abnormal chemical imbalances in the mother's womb, which arguable influence \"gayness\". There's no indication God is the one behind that. \n\n \n So God influences everything, but God's not behind that? Or are you arguing that gayness is merely part of the payment of original sin? Wasn't that what Christ died to pay off? I'd also like to see the papers that you discuss, kindly post references or links.\n \n \nAnother unfortunate \"twist.\" Not persecuting, just calling people to repentance and salvation, just as numerous individuals in the Bible have done.\n\n \n So saying that people should be treated as 'pagans or tax collectors' if they won't submit to the judgement of the church isn't persecuting them at all, given the historical precedent of violence towards the 'non-repentant'.\n \n I haven't twisted anything. \n \n \"I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.\" (Matthew 10:34)\n \n \"Then the Lord our God delivered the enemy to us, and we struck him, and his sons, and all his tribe. We took all his cities and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little children.\" (Deut 2:33)\n \n You're not the only one who can post scripture, and it's clear that your ideas about strife and persecution not being supported by the Bible are not totally accurate.",

   "[QUOTE=Easyrider;245616]I wouldn't think 100%, but a great many were. BTW, why rape the men when girls were made available? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n Please don't try to make sense out of fables, because when you do you come with ridiculous things like your above statement. Why would anyone with half a brain offer these Sodomites, (who were suppossedly homosexuals) women as a substitute? In addition to that, it doesn't appear that Lot's daughters had much to say in the matter. They were offerred to the crowd, the way you would give up money to a band of robbers. They were property of their father, to be used as he saw fit. Gay sex or any type of other sex is fine between consenting adults. Lot offerring his daughters should have been the sin worthy of fire and brimstone. Where are your god's principles and priorities? That being said, why would god choose death and destruction over kindness and goodwill? That does not represent a perfect being. Nor could a perfect being create imperfect beings, such as man. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n EZRIDER:\n Also, the Sodomites would most likely have had to have been aroused by a male butt in order to get sexually \"excited\" to perform the act. \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n There you go again making a desperate attempt to make logic out of folklore. You know nothing about the sodomites, except what you have read in the bible. How do you know that they ever existed? And if by chance they did, here you are speculating on what male body part got them excited enough to violate that particular body part. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n EZRIDER:\n I can't imagine a straight male who would think there was anything arousing about another man's sphincter - rape or otherwise. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Gaetano:\n There you go again, this time using your self-admitted limited imagination to draw a conclusion about the sexual mindsets of an imaginary people from a book you assume is somehow connected with the real god.....................\n You stated above: \"I can't imagine a straight male who would think there was anything arousing about another man's sphincter - rape or otherwise.\" Then you know very little about the prison system. I also don't know any gay men who are aroused by another man's sphincter. If so, it would be a fetish and therefore not typical of most gay men. In response to the end of your statement where it says \"rape or otherwise\", it needs to be noted that rape is rape and there is no \"otherwise.\" It is a crime of violence, not passion. The sexual orientation of a rapist does not necessarily correspond with their victims. Prison is a perfect example of that. Over the years I have heard that the group of male sodomites around Lot's house were a mob of violent sex crazed homosexuals. Gay men just do not form violent mobs that roam the streets and surround houses demanding sex from the dwellers within.",

Much easier to argue against homosexuals (who make up a very small percent of their congregtions if there are any in there at all) using obscure references through the bible, while divorce, which is plainly spoken against by Jesus himself, is tucked away.",

   "But divorcees can already marry, why has there not been an attempt by the right to pass a constitutional ammendment to protect marriage from divorcees? Surely the idea that marriage is not a lifelong covenant is far more a threat than the gender of the participants? Jesus had a lot more to say about divorce than he ever did about homosexuality.

   "Sure it is. Gay sex was an abomination to God (Lev. 18:22; 20:13). The blindness spoken of in the example you gave wasn't a sinful condition to begin with. \n\n However most (evangelical/ fundamentalist) would argue that any abnormality, including being born 'gay' was a product of 'sin'. You seem to have similar underlying beliefs in the postings you made.\n Your Thalomide baby comment is a prime example of this. \n I ask, WHY couldn't your god create such a person. Why even state that as you did unless you beleived god wasn't responsible?\n \n The logic I'm using is simple. If god created a blind person, who was free from sin which contradicted common dogmatic beliefs at the time of the event, they why could he not create a person born gay?\n \n Then we can go on to WHY would god create someone with a sinful appearance and/or predeliction and not others? Is your god unfair, unjust, a liar? That would seem to contradict scripture if he is.\n \n \nI wasn't arguing that.\n\n Repeat, explain your thalomide baby comment. What ARE your beliefs in regards to illness, infirmity and anything that results in a human being 'less' than what would be considered perfect. \n \n \n \n \nRelax. God can help the homosexual overcome their condition.\n\n Seems odd that he doesn't with anything approaching regularity.\n Granted the messiah healed the blind man and some believe that a christian can do anything the He did...why don't they?\n Why is it that laying on of hands, prayer...doesn't really work in anything approaching consistency?\n \n \nIt's common amomgst false prophets and infidels to defend sin and gay sex.\n\n It's more common for true believers to fail to display love and compassion. Granted the medium of the Internet isn't conduive for you to showing any of those but, I don't think I'm the only one who beleives to be acting in a haughty, superior manner. Possibly falling to spiritual superiority.\n Also, tyou aren't called according to scripture to really fight with infidels over religious issues. You present your beliefs, the scripture to the unbeliever. If they don't accept it, knock the dust off your sandles and move on. Let them to their own devices and pray for them. Not but your head repeatedly against them. As to those professing to be christians, yes, you can debate and present scripture stating that homosexuality is contrary to gods desires. \n \n I'm just curious why gays, outside the CHURCH/ body of christ, living in a secular environment should be attacked or hindered by religious desires. If they don't care or believe in what you do, leave them alone, let your god enact his perfect justice and/ or wrath upon them at his leisure.\n \n \nIf I believed that God created perfect people I wouldn't be professing Christ to you to save them or make them whole. You've created a pack of strawman in your arguments.\n\n They aren't strawmen.\n \n You made a comment that implictly pushed the notion that god doesn't make thalomide babies. I respond with scripture stating he has done similar before and that you really don't know why god does what he does.\n Furthermore, god doesn't seem to operate according to the scriptures as presented. The lame don't walk, the blind don't see and the deaf countinue to not hear. The handful of miraculous healings that can be verified as legitimate can come from ANY belief system. Shinotism, Catholicism, Protestantism, Paganistic beliefs...any. So you can't say that the christian god is the only healer...unless he operates in a manner that doens't fit snug with the bible.\n \n As to gays who've been healed in Christ.\n Most haven't.\n The pitiful handful who profess to such either weren't fully gay to begin with or are simply forcing a behavior upon themselves. There are many who 'back slide' into their old, gay selves.\n \n \n While I do believe the bible is explicit about homosexuality as a sin. I do ponder why a god would 'make gay' people from birth. No, I don't believe most are born gay, but some are. \n I think Christian beliefs are for christians. Evangelism is to spread the love and mercy that the Christ wants to extend to all humans in a loving and compassionate manner. Then training new christians to adhear and 'sin no more'. It's not for those who reject it. Thus, as a secular American, in a land where live and let live and equality for all is a way of life, I ponder why fundies attack a minority and prevent them from simply pursuing their own happiness. I think the gov't should get out of the marriage deal altogther and resort to civil unions, letting various religious organizations conduct marriages as they please, that are recognized also as civil unions for rights and benefits issues in the govt's eyes.\n \n The gays see you as cramming your interpretations and religious beliefs down their throats in a hypocritical manner, denying them the same priveledges and rights as you have.\n Furthermore, I've heard more christians defend divorce than oppose it. This, of course, is reflected in the high rates of divorce amongst them, and remarriage as pointed out.\n \n Funny that the one thing that does affect a christian marriage ( the ease of which a divorce can be had) and is spoke about in the gosples by the Christ himself, is over looked and left alone by 'true believers'.\n The reason why you don't see pro divorce marches...is because they can already get them now. Anyone reflect about Ireland in past decades where they protested for divorce and abortion rights?\n \n Let the gays marry and they'll stop marching for that 'right'. If you think they'll burn for it, let them. It's their CHOICE...unless you're calvinistic and believe god decides in the beginning who will and who won't.\n \n \n Let me ask you, have you yet put a false prophet to death?",

   "It's the behavior that's sinful, Zardoz. Many straight people are inclined to commit fornication too.\n\n I would agree that your bible is explicit and implicit in stating that it is too, both NT and OT.\n \n \nI suppose he could if he really wanted, but the scientific evidence was that it was Thalidomide, not God, that caused those abnormalities. \n\n God, being a soverign lord who operates on a level far beyond human understanding could easily be behind the Thalidomide. So, why state science here as a reason? And if the children were not born of sin, why haven't they been made whole by a faith healer? Why hasn't anyone born in unfair inequity been made phyically whole.\n \n \nWhy doesn't he create pedophiles too? Because it's an abomination to him.\n\n If they are 'born' with that inclination, and I have yet to see any statements or evidence believing so, then it is possible that He did. Why deny his power and might and absolute control of all things?\n \n \nYou'll have to ask God that one. But there are many of those who have claimed such healings in the name of Christ.\n\n 'Claims' don't hold much water. There exist groups of people who do investigate these claims. Cathiolics have a vatican appointed group to look into such claims and verify them to the best of their abilities. IIRC, a fairly recent news segment had them verifying a mere 500 with only a couple who were healed of disease such as cancer. A far cry from the fake healers who claim legions are healed. So far, all such claims by some notable healers are easily proven to be false. Those who claim they are healed can not produce evidence that they were 1) sick to begin with or b) even healed if they were. Furthermore, all such scrientific studies of legitimate miricle healings have found various beleifs and faiths involved. From this Christ to Shintoism. The common denominator seemed to be the patients own desire and not an external force. A recent study did find for heart patients, that prayer or others didn't work for them and in some cases had a detrimental effect.\n \n \nThe Bible says that Noah was a \"Preacher of Righteousness.\" How many years do you suppose he contended with the infidels? I'll shake the dust off my feet when I'm feel called to do so.\n\n If you feel called to repeatedly preach to those who deny, then fine. But, what I and some here think is that the medium of the Internet or your actual attitude makes it appear that you ignoring love and compassion in your pleas for your target to repent and believe as they do. That you're not attempting to let them make the CHOICE of their oven free will but are trying to force it upon them.\n \n \nAnd let them turn America into another Sodom and Gomorrah in the mean time? Forget it.\n\n Mighty big of you to think that you can prevent such an occurance from happening. I'd say that the nation already rivals those cities in most cases.\n And furthermore, so what? He in his perfect mercy was shown to save the rightious there, however few, allow him to do so in accordance to his will. If you feel you are called to sound warning, great, but you can't force others to comply. These individuals want to have LEGAL and secular rights, let them. They already have given themselves over to immorality in your mind. \n \n \nMost didn't want to. Some have, though. Why do you think Christ did that if it was perfectly legitimate to begin with?\n\n Because, as I said, most 'healed' of gayness weren't gay to begin with or, out of pressure have been forced to comply with expections. Peer pressure does a lot. Witness Rep. Foley or the apostate demogogue Tim Haggard. Forced to live a double life out of expectations forced upon them by the medium they were found in.\n \n \nYou don't know that. That's a pure supposition on your part, unless you want to present the full range of evidence on every one who has been changed.\n\n Of course it's supposition but it's is based on interviews and documentaries with gay christians, those claiming to be healed of this sexual immorality and their recidivism rate and how they live double lives. There are many in church leadership positions who are said to be living on the 'down low'. \n If I can ge off my bum and look up links, I'll try to find the time. I was going on 60 minutes (and/or similar) TV shows that dealt with this phenomena of homosexual healings. \n \n \nBe careful. You might get Jo Bennet's blood pressure up, along with a few others. But I'm glad you also realize that.\n\n The thing with 'liberal' christians, is they adhear to what the Christ pushed the most. Love, compassion and mercy. As I've said, nearly all 'Christians' take a cafeteria approach to their bible. It's impossible to do otherwise. There are simple doctrins that most believe are needed to be followed and some that really don't matter as much. There are dogmatic beliefs that help with the important doctrins and there are some that detract from correct scripture. But because of the fracturing of the Church and due to the ever present ego of man, the odds of finding the straight and narrow path are small, thus the bible clearly states many seek yet few find. So the numbers accepted will be logically small. \n So, what's more important?\n Following the greatest of commandments? Loving the Christ with all you heart, mind and soul as well as your neighbor. Or, forcing dogmatic doctrin that some believe to be repressive onto unbelievers? Seriouisly, follow scripture and have no fellowship with your fellow christians if you think they have gone astray and refuse to listen to good counsel. \n \n \nSome might reject it today and change their minds tomorrow. You don't want to give up too easily.\n\n You catch more flies with honey than you do vinegar. You also can't force choice upon others. If they are harming no one other than themselves, let them. We all have to learn in our own ways. I'd say there are more important issues to champion against that would be more pleasing to the lord than bashing your head against unbelievers and apostates. \n \n \nWhat's this \"attack\" claim? Most of us are just defending traditional American and Godly values / beliefs in a legal manner in a public forum.\n You're preventing them from pursuing their own happiness in accordance to their own beliefs that ARE protected by law. Defense of this so called 'tradition' is dangerous. Slavery was a tradition and also legally protected and biblically sound. You still defend that one?\n The gays already violate everything you desire. Their sexual practices are allowed. Soddomy is no longer illegal. You don't have to personally recognize their marriage, even if some 'say' they are married and have personal ceremonies for it. All you'll have to do is allow them legal rights that they have outlined. \n \n \nTell them to take it up at the polling booth. Most Americans don't want gay marriage.\n\n Most Americans really don't care. I recall covering a news segment in MA. where a man was being interviewed by the media over his anti-gay marriage sign in his lawn. He placed it there for a friend but directly said he didn't care if gays were allowed marriage rights or not. It didn't personally affect him. Furthermore, gays are a minority who have little direct impact on most. Thus, it's easier for most to say no and maintain the current status quo than to change things and live with the consequences. Humans seldom like change.\n One of the most effective anti-gay marriage arguments for those who don't THINK is the slippery slope. If you allow gays, you'll have to allow polygamy, incestous relationships and paedophiles to wed minors as well as beastiality...eventually as these groups will press their agendas too. Or something to that effect. The arguements always pop up in debates like this.\n \n \nI haven't. But two wrongs still don't make a right. \n\n Are you called to police the body of Christ by seeking to repeal divorce laws? Seems to me, such a practice as divorce has more impact on christians that gay marriage does. Do you fellowship with adulters in your church? Those divorced for trivial reasons who've remarried? Does your pastor remarry such non-widows? \n This is a case of the splinter in my eye is nothing compared to the plank in yours. \n Such behavior is hypocritical, to call on non-christians to follow christian practices and traditions while not calling fellow true believers to task as the bible illustraits in numerous instances.\n \n \nYou're asking me to give up a legitimate constitutional right to oppose whatever ungodly activities in this nation we feel like opposing. You do what you want, though. But believing gay sex is a Biblical sin as you do and then turning a blind eye towards the practice is no virtue.\n\n There is no constitutional right to oppose 'ungodly activities'.\n All I'm doing is using your own text to debate you with or agree with you. I never said that I personally beleived any of it to be true. I'm fairly conversant in the text, the many arguments on it's meanings and chief desires and weasly arguments to twist scripture out of context and to apply new meanings. Allow them their marriage just keep telling them that it's wrong and you grieve for their immortal souls. Counsel fellow believers and disfellowship them if they persist in 'sin'.\n All of this is biblical teachings and supported by scripture you say you believe in. \n Be content. For if you are right, the kingdom of heaven is yours. However, if you aren't. \n \n \nNo, and it's unbiblical in the NT for us to do so. Have you?\n\n I can not answer this as the statue of limitations for what is secularly known as murder has no time limit.\n However it is has not been repudiated in the NT as some old testiment commandments have been said to have been. There are numerous warnings against false prophets in the new testiment and admonitions to avoid them. The call to put them to death in Deu 18, IMO would still stand. No diffrent that the opposition to homosexual practices. If a false prophet persists in their ways, they stand a far greater chance of destroying the body of christ and leading many astray and to a vile end that allowing gays legal rights in a secular community.\n \n Police yourselves before policing others seems to be good advice.\n From where I sit, the Church is imploding. Demogogues and false prophets (as defined by your own scripture) abound. The sheep are being feasted upon for filthy lucre, their needs left unmet. All the 'sins' of secular nonbelievers are magnified in the body. The plank in your own eyes is now a forest.\n If the protestant reformation was needed to help correct the many blasphemous and nonbiblical errors of Catholicism, I'd say it's time again.\n \n I know we're discussing gay marriage at the moment. But, you'll not convince anyone if your own house is in such disorder and you do nothing to rectify the situation.",

   "God, being a soverign lord who operates on a level far beyond human understanding could easily be behind the Thalidomide.\n\n \n Sounds more like a theory than something that can be supported.\n \n \nSo far, all such claims by some notable healers are easily proven to be false.\n\n \n You'll need to list all the investigations of every single incident to convince me of that.\n \n \nThe common denominator seemed to be the patients own desire and not an external force. A recent study did find for heart patients, that prayer or others didn't work for them and in some cases had a detrimental effect.\n\n \n How was \"Thou shall not put the Lord thy God to the test\" accounted for in that study? Was it even mentioned?\n \n \n\n If you feel called to repeatedly preach to those who deny, then fine. But, what I and some here think is that the medium of the Internet or your actual attitude makes it appear that you ignoring love and compassion in your pleas for your target to repent and believe as they do.\n\n \n Love speaks the truth. Sometimes it's not easy to accept. \n \n \n\n Mighty big of you to think that you can prevent such an occurance from happening.\n\n \n So we simply give up? How about hitting a lick for what's right in God's eyes instead of appeasing that which is unvirtuous like you're doing?\n \n \nIf you feel you are called to sound warning, great, but you can't force others to comply. These individuals want to have LEGAL and secular rights, let them. They already have given themselves over to immorality in your mind.\n\n \n I'm not forcing anyone. And have they not given themselves over to immorality in your mind, according to the Bible?\n \n \n\n Because, as I said, most 'healed' of gayness weren't gay to begin with or, out of pressure have been forced to comply with expections.\n\n \n If that's your belief, fine. It denies the power of God and is a gross overgenerlization to boot.\n \n \nThe thing with 'liberal' christians, is they adhear to what the Christ pushed the most. Love, compassion and mercy.\n\n \n I think they missed the parts where the Bible says, \"Love does not rejoice in iniquity,\" and, \"Love does a neighbor no harm,\" like enticing someone else into a sinful relationship. Where's the compassion in that?\n \n \nSo, what's more important?\n Following the greatest of commandments? Loving the Christ with all you heart, mind and soul as well as your neighbor. Or, forcing dogmatic doctrin that some believe to be repressive onto unbelievers? Seriouisly, follow scripture and have no fellowship with your fellow christians if you think they have gone astray and refuse to listen to good counsel.\n\n \n There you go using the expression \"forcing\" again. This is a public forum and I have free speech. Are you trying to force your values / viewpoint on me? I don't think so. Neither am I doing that. \n \n \nYou're preventing them from pursuing their own happiness in accordance to their own beliefs that ARE protected by law.\n\n \n No, I'm exercising my free speech and right to vote, etc., according to my beliefs. You're appeasing sin by trying to quiet those who seek to turn them to God / Christ for repentance and salvation. \n \n As one writer said: \"Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their fetters (bindings).\" The more liberties a godless people achieve, the more enslaved they ultimately become in their carnal obsessions - the the detriment of their spiritual condition.\n \n \n Soddomy is no longer illegal. You don't have to personally recognize their marriage, even if some 'say' they are married and have personal ceremonies for it. All you'll have to do is allow them legal rights that they have outlined.\n\n \n Not when it comes to gay marriage. I can vote against gay marriage and even speak out against it at will, which is my constitutional right of free speech. \n \n \n\n Most Americans really don't care.\n\n \n I'm not buying that. Plenty care and even go so far as to go the the voting booth to expess their views against gay marriage. And for the most part they're prevailing.\n \n \n If you allow gays, you'll have to allow polygamy, incestous relationships and paedophiles to wed minors as well as beastiality...eventually as these groups will press their agendas too. Or something to that effect. The arguements always pop up in debates like this.\n\n \n I think it's a fair argument. After all, who are you to judge? \n \n \n\n Are you called to police the body of Christ by seeking to repeal divorce laws?\n\n \n You start promoting / defending unbiblical divorce and we'll have some words on that too.\n \n \nThis is a case of the splinter in my eye is nothing compared to the plank in yours.\n\n \n No, both unbiblical divorce and gay sex are wrong. \n \n \nThere is no constitutional right to oppose 'ungodly activities'.\n\n \n I'm doing it right now in this public forum. Will you be calling the political correctness police now? (Hi, I'm calling to report an incident of free speech...\")\n \n \nThere are numerous warnings against false prophets in the new testiment and admonitions to avoid them. The call to put them to death in Deu 18, IMO would still stand. No diffrent that the opposition to homosexual practices.\n\n \n Who's prophesying? Not me. And don't forget the NT.\n \n \nFrom where I sit, the Church is imploding. Demogogues and false prophets (as defined by your own scripture) abound. The sheep are being feasted upon for filthy lucre, their needs left unmet. All the 'sins' of secular nonbelievers are magnified in the body. The plank in your own eyes is now a forest.\n\n \n Get real. Do you even go to church? There's plenty of godly people there. But there is sin most everywhere too. Which is even more reason not to lay down an be an appeaser of it.\n \n Thanks for your thoughts!",

   "Sounds more like a theory than something that can be supported.\n\n NOW you're getting it... Your whole book is that. But, I will attest that the bible is pretty explicit about the Lord in control of all things and is soverign.\n \n \nYou'll need to list all the investigations of every single incident to convince me of that.\n\n I could for such a simple forum discussion here. But, I think the reverse is true, present cases on those who claim to have been healed, including before and after documentation of such. While I doubt you believe in the heresy of the Word of Faith movement or tent revival pentacostalism, they have been extensively researched. I see no reason to post rebuttals to please you when you haven't posted anyhing beyond 'They CLAIM' to please me.\n I'm sure the proof is in the pudding. If such claims of miraculous healings as professed by Christians who beleive in such were real, it'd be widely published, constantly covered and used extensively by believers as a source of faith based and nearly free alternative medicine and psychology. Such simply isn't true. And some who believe that are healed have died due to the fact that they weren't.\n \n \nHow was \"Thou shall not put the Lord thy God to the test\" accounted for in that study? Was it even mentioned?\n\n See? Your bible can be used for anything. What about, \"Ask for anything in my name and you shall receive it?\" What about the biblical statements that with the authority of the name of Christ, miracles done in his name will be preformed? Even the apostles asked the Christ why others were performing said miracles to which he replied, if they aren't against me, they are for.\n \n \nLove speaks the truth. Sometimes it's not easy to accept. \n\n I will agree with you there, but sometimes the truth can be feed to those in need a lot easier than what you appear to be doing. Do you feed babes whole food or milk? \n \n \nSo we simply give up? How about hitting a lick for what's right in God's eyes instead of appeasing that which is unvirtuous like you're doing?\n\n How about allow people to do and have 'Evderything is permissable but not everything is beneficial'? Let ALL things be possible but teach them why is should not be so. Those who subscribe to your faith can be more easily encouraged to follow, or suffer the potential consequences for their actions. The only thing I can think that you should champion with be when a 3rd person is directly harmed by the actions of another, thus I can understand the attitudes of Christians agaisnt abortion.\n \n \nI'm not forcing anyone. And have they not given themselves over to immorality in your mind, according to the Bible?\n\n Sure, according to your bible. And? If they won't listen to the warnings nor the scripture, as adults it's their own choice. \n We're already past preventing immorality with anti-soddomy laws being gone. The question now is mostly legal and secular, in an increasily diverse and secular country. \n \n \nIf that's your belief, fine. It denies the power of God and is a gross overgenerlization to boot.\n\n In denial, all it does is, to me, show that a literalist interpretation of the bible is often wrong OR the whole bible is wrong and 'His word (is) returned to him void' which goes against what many believe. The bible can be used to support nearly any agenda, even when taken into context. \n \n \nI think they missed the parts where the Bible says, \"Love does not rejoice in iniquity,\" and, \"Love does a neighbor no harm,\" like enticing someone else into a sinful relationship. Where's the compassion in that?\n\n While I agree with you that scripture does support that, no one's asking you to rejoice. Lament and mourn for the future suffering of others, constantly pray and remain open to their sincear repentance. Be a light house to the unbeliever and engage in ernest counseling for those who do profess, using scripture as you see it to rebuff their errant beliefs.\n \n \nThere you go using the expression \"forcing\" again. This is a public forum and I have free speech. Are you trying to force your values / viewpoint on me? I don't think so. Neither am I doing that. \n\n Maybe force isn't a proper definition for the prevention you are doing but, you do seem to be forcing a version of Christian religion upon non christains and preventing them from pursuing happiness and enjoying similar freedoms and rights you have. For the nonbeliever, they ask, why should I have to comply with your religious beleif system in the land of the free and home of equality. \n \n \nNo, I'm exercising my free speech and right to vote, etc., according to my beliefs. You're appeasing sin by trying to quiet those who seek to turn them to God / Christ for repentance and salvation.\n\n This isn't a free speech issue. I haven't asked you to shut up, nor have I treated your beliefs with disrespect (I don't think in this thread). I've attempted to use your own framework of reference (the bible) in discourse and have been open to the possibility that you are sincearly mournful and are operating out of the best form of love for your fellow man that the internet will allow. While man should follow the scripture and desires of god, there is nothing in the bible that says he must. The consequences are listed for the failure to follow. Call your warnings until your dying days with the full faith you have that it pleases the lord. I'm not quieting you, nor telling you how to vote. Just attempting to use the same persuasive ability to convince you that the fanaticism of your beliefs could be better used. When your own house is in disroder, it's hard to convince others that you're right.\n \n \nAs one writer said: \"Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their fetters (bindings).\" The more liberties a godless people achieve, the more enslaved they ultimately become in their carnal obsessions - the the detriment of their spiritual condition.\n\n True, we're all slaves to our desires and passions. But, even Soddom had Lot. Even the pre-flood world had Noah. If you're worried about yourself due to others having more freedoms/bindings, then wouldn't one say your faith is weak?\n \n \nNot when it comes to gay marriage. I can vote against gay marriage and even speak out against it at will, which is my constitutional right of free speech.\n \n Of course you can. But, eventually, gays will marry. More of your immorality issues have been allowed and will continue to be allowed. \n \n \nI'm not buying that. Plenty care and even go so far as to go the the voting booth to expess their views against gay marriage. And for the most part they're prevailing.\n\n Voting booth, place where we get to express our bigotry and jump on popularistic band wagons. \n \n \nI think it's a fair argument. After all, who are you to judge?\n \n Exactly. But, like you, I am one to judge. We all are. \n \n \nYou start promoting / defending unbiblical divorce and we'll have some words on that too.\n\n I don't have to defend that which isn't attacked. Is there any place where you or other christians have attacked legalized divorce? I'd think that this very common problem errodes more of the church and casts ALL who engage into ruination (currently heterosexuals, a lot of them Christians) that minority desired gay marriage. The gays are already buring according to you and the bible, they can't burn more for having legal protections.\n \n \nI'm doing it right now in this public forum. Will you be calling the political correctness police now? (Hi, I'm calling to report an incident of free speech...\")\n\n Nope, you're engaging in other constitutionally protected practices (assuming this forum is US based) not oppose 'ungodly activities'. \n \n \nWho's prophesying? Not me. And don't forget the NT.\n\n Many evangelical charismatics, which daily gains more adherants due to their anti-biblical teachings. The NT has no ban against stoning a false teacher as the OT said to do. Even Jesus was attacked because some thought (desired) him to be one. In the case of the stoning of the adultress, he simply asked those without sin to cast the 1st stone, now that Christians are cleaned from sin in Christ, that would logically be possible. Furthermore, Jesus asked the adultress to go and sin no more. If she were to continue to sin, shouldn't she be put to death? \n \n \nGet real. Do you even go to church? There's plenty of godly people there. But there is sin most everywhere too. Which is even more reason not to lay down an be an appeaser of it.\n\n I've been to many churches of most denominations. I have only detected what would be described as godliness in a handful of people or professing Christians. Most, are no different from secularists. Furthermore, I have been personally harmed, without cause, by the teachings and presuasion of demogogues professing to be men of Christ. \n I've seen your bible used to support and oppose everything under the sun...at the same time. The body is in division and continues to divide with each new sect and 'non denominational' church opened. They're actually the denomination of Me (the pastor of the church). \n I'm also not the only one to believe this or similar. Look at those who post here. Your fellow christians are divided amongst themselves and more secular people oppose from without. \"A house divided can not stand\". I certainly don't want to be nearby when it falls. \n \n \nThanks for your thoughts!\n\n Thanks for yours.",

   " If such claims of miraculous healings as professed by Christians who beleive in such were real, it'd be widely published, constantly covered and used extensively by believers as a source of faith based and nearly free alternative medicine and psychology. Such simply isn't true.\n\n \n There's healing services all over the world, and countless testimonials from the healed. They don't need psychologists (some of which are Christians, by the way) to try to make their judgments.\n \n \n\n And some who believe that are healed have died due to the fact that they weren't.\n\n \n Maybe they weren't. Or maybe they fell back into sin. Jesus warned about that too (\"Do not sin again or something worse might happen to you.\"). \n \n \n\n See? Your bible can be used for anything. What about, \"Ask for anything in my name and you shall receive it?\" What about the biblical statements that with the authority of the name of Christ, miracles done in his name will be preformed? Even the apostles asked the Christ why others were performing said miracles to which he replied, if they aren't against me, they are for.\n\n \n It has to be according to God's will. Don't forget that one.\n \n \n\n We're already past preventing immorality with anti-soddomy laws being gone. The question now is mostly legal and secular, in an increasily diverse and secular country.\n\n \n There's also people trying to legitimize man / boy sex. Still doesn't make it right even if it's legalized. \n \n \nMaybe force isn't a proper definition for the prevention you are doing but, you do seem to be forcing a version of Christian religion upon non christains and preventing them from pursuing happiness and enjoying similar freedoms and rights you have.\n\n \n And just maybe the gays are trying to FORCE their immoral quest for gay marriage on people who don't want it.\n \n \n I'm not quieting you, nor telling you how to vote. Just attempting to use the same persuasive ability to convince you that the fanaticism of your beliefs could be better used.\n\n \n As opposed to your fanatical beliefs? If you're Christian, shouldn't you be trying to convince people around here to receive Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, rather than defend iniquity?\n \n \nVoting booth, place where we get to express our bigotry and jump on popularistic band wagons.\n\n \n Is that in San Francisco? \n \n \nThe gays are already buring according to you and the bible, they can't burn more for having legal protections.\n\n \n Nope. If any gays are burning, then so are immoral straights - any who choose to reject Christ's salvation. It's on them, not me.\n \n \nI've been to many churches of most denominations. I have only detected what would be described as godliness in a handful of people or professing Christians. Most, are no different from secularists. Furthermore, I have been personally harmed, without cause, by the teachings and presuasion of demogogues professing to be men of Christ. \n I've seen your bible used to support and oppose everything under the sun...at the same time. The body is in division and continues to divide with each new sect and 'non denominational' church opened. They're actually the denomination of Me (the pastor of the church). \n I'm also not the only one to believe this or similar. Look at those who post here. Your fellow christians are divided amongst themselves and more secular people oppose from without. \"A house divided can not stand\". I certainly don't want to be nearby when it falls. \n\n \n The gates of Hell shall not be able to stand against the true church of Christ, as Jesus taught. And conservative churches are growing, while many of the liberal churches aren't. \n \n Cheers...",

   "Gay sex is a sin, Shadow. There's no twisting about it, except in the pro-gay churches that will stop at nothing to try to legitimize their sin. But rest assured, God isn't fooled.\n\n \n Yes, God is not fooled by the hate spewed by \"christians\" who are bigoted against gays. Maybe you could tell me exactly where it says gay sex is a sin, because all I see are obscure and vague verses left up to translation errors (oh, maybe you mean the one that forbids gay sex acts during certain ceremonies - pagan practices brought into the church- made by Paul)",

Jesus warned about that too (\"Do not sin again or something worse might happen to you.\"). \n \n\n Well there goes everyone down the toilet (Unless, that is, you are claiming that you haven't sinned again). Guess we shouldn't allow anyone to marry or even have sex for that matter. We can just rely on artificial insemination to continue the human race.emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n\n There's also people trying to legitimize man / boy sex.

Paedophilia does not have a thing to do with homosexuality, and your comparison shows how bigoted you are.\n \n\n And just maybe the gays are trying to FORCE their immoral quest for gay marriage on people who don't want it.\n\n \n First of all, it's not just gays trying to obtain those rights, straights(such as myself and most in my church) are right there with them - straights that are disgusted that such discrimination still exists in our supposed wonderful and free country.\n \n\n As opposed to your fanatical beliefs? If you're Christian, shouldn't you be trying to convince people around here to receive Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, rather than defend iniquity?\n\n \n I certainly do try to convince people to receive Jesus as their Lord (they happen to be turned off often due to a stereotypical view received after seeing how all the hypocritical \"christians\" like you act.) However, I would not encourage them to join a church where their very nature is insulted. Much better to go to a place they are accepted.",

   "There's healing services all over the world, and countless testimonials from the healed. They don't need psychologists (some of which are Christians, by the way) to try to make their judgments.\n\n Testimonials mean jack. Hard physical proofs are what needed for such outrageous claims. As I said, the Catholic Church investigates such claims and has found some to be legitimate. SOME...and in a miniscule amount compared to those who profes healing. Furthermore, such proven miraculous healings are pan-religious, across the spectrum of faiths. So, Christianity can't lay claim to being the only source.\n Look into Marjoe some time for a famous evangelist who outted his antics. Even he claimed to have witnessed only 2 cases of healing. \n Someone famous for their claims of healing is Benny Hinn, fairly well known WofFer whom most see and think evangelist poster boy. For all of his thousand of healings not ONE single one has been proven to have happened.\n He and countless other false prophets are leading your own brethern to their eternal doom and have you done a thing about it? Just curious. Do your police your own as your scripture calls you to do or allow the weeds to flourish. You're so worried about the state of the gardens of others while your fellow christians are led to ruin. \n \n The gist of my comment is, if such healings are true, they'd be more than widely known, provable and advertised for all. As well as a very nice source of healing AND psychological services for believers. There should be no reason why bible believing and christ loving christians to suffer physical and mental ailments. And, while some would say the healings are based on the believers own faith, many have died proclaiming they were healed when they weren't. I don't know how much more faith one should show than that.\n \n \nMaybe they weren't. Or maybe they fell back into sin. Jesus warned about that too (\"Do not sin again or something worse might happen to you.\").\n\n Yes, 7 fold IIRC. \n \n \nIt has to be according to God's will. Don't forget that one.\n\n If IS according to gods will as some literalist desire the bible to say.\n \"Life more abundantly\". \"Prosperous\". \"By his stripes were are healed\".\n Either multitudes are getting what is supposedly a simple to understand bible wrong...or it's simply wrong. As I said, the bible has and will be used to support anything, taken in context and out.\n \n \nThere's also people trying to legitimize man / boy sex. Still doesn't make it right even if it's legalized.\n\n Right and Legal don't have to be the same thing, they're apples and oranges. You don't even have to like it. The best form of defense against permissability is to instruct and educate others as to the harm that is/ could be done. \n \n \nAnd just maybe the gays are trying to FORCE their immoral quest for gay marriage on people who don't want it.\n\n Ironically, ATM I'm watching a DVD of the TV show, 'Big Love' about the FLDS. It's quite surprisingly good. While I'd never chose such a life style, IMO so long as they're consenting adults, let them make their own rules. \n A homosexual will be hard pressed to force another to marry them without a cultic and insular group to assist in the manipulation. So far, only religious groups have such powers. Such as many members of the FLDS are said to do in regards to pressuring minors to marry. IIRC Warren Jeffs is currently being prosecuted on odd charges of facilitation to rape (even though no documented rape case has occurred) of a young girl to her 19 year old cousin against her will. That is force, done in the guise of religious beliefs. I haven't heard of a case of gays forcing marriage onto others against their will.\n Have you taken a moment to walk in the shoes of the other and for a brief moment divorce yourself from religious dogma and doctrin (not abandone it) and even try to understand the reasoning of the other side?\n \n There is little to no rational, non-religious reason not to grant homosexuals the same legalistic protections and rights that heterosexuals enjoy.\n \n \nAs opposed to your fanatical beliefs? If you're Christian, shouldn't you be trying to convince people around here to receive Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, rather than defend iniquity?\n\n \n I thought I made myself pretty clear.\n I would be classified as an anti-christian. I think your christ has it bass ackwards and taught nonsense that harms humans and isn't condusive to the continuation of the human race. I think evangelicals should be exterminated as their overt mandate is to bring about the apocalypse to help usher in the 2nd coming. As this is doubtful to ever happen, they will most likely seek to fulfill their own version of the prophesies. I say this as a matter of self and species defense. \n But, it's funny how nearly everyone who I find discussing christian religious issues with thinks I am a Christian. I blame it on useless bible knowledge.\n \n \nIs that in San Francisco?\n\n Actually, everywhere. \n \n \nNope. If any gays are burning, then so are immoral straights - any who choose to reject Christ's salvation. It's on them, not me.\n\n And?\n \n \nThe gates of Hell shall not be able to stand against the true church of Christ, as Jesus taught. And conservative churches are growing, while many of the liberal churches aren't. \n Cheers...\n\n \n The ONLY churches that are growing are anti-biblical Word of Faithers. They are the gnostics that Paul warned people about. They pimp their followers for a lavish lifestyle, are known to be immoral themselves.\n TD Jakes for example denies the trinity and was reared as oneness pentacostal. Joel Olsteen is a cotton candy preacher who, when asked, refuses to state the Jesus is the ONLY way to heaven. (search Youtube).\n All 'growing' churches are directly or indirectly associated to this fast growing movement. Even Pres. Bush has been in WofF (pronounced Wolf) Churches. They claim to be conservative christians. What a laugh. TBN, the 700 Club. All vocal, televised and radio waved WofFers. Oral Robets, Pat Robertson. \n Unless you're talking about some other pseudo-christian church denomination, the ONLY growing christian movement are them. Largest thing going. Mega churches with herds of sheep being fleeced and mistreated then lead to a slaughter. IF your bible is to be true. \n \n I love the claims of Christians as they fight. 'TRUE Christians'. Out right fakers and demogogues lay claim to this title of being the only TRUE faith/sect/belief. Why would I think your claims are the right ones? I see gaps in your beliefs and presentation without even yet knowing your denomination and persuasion. \n \n As an observer, one amongst untold millions, your religion can't be true. It makes wild, unsubstantiated and often proven to be wrong claims. You fight amongst yourselves. You all suffer from unbriddled arrogance as faith demands and lack humilitay in most of whats imporant. Like the pharasies, you're obsssessed over the laws, rules, regulations and miss the message of love and mercy, sacrifice and compassion that seemed to be at the heart of the Christ's message. Personally\n \n \n Personally, I'm straight. Married for about 13 years now. Would rather see the gov't gt out of the marriage business and simply issue civil union contracts for rights to all who desire them who can legally enter into a contract (18+/ emancipated children) and let what ever religions marry as they desire with such marriages automatically being granted civil union status by the gov't if the parties desire.\n I performed my own marriage to my (formerly) Chrisitan fundamentalist wife in a park and had a female pagan friend who was capable of legal marriage, simply sign the license and use a customer in her store to bear witness exactly one year after my 'spiritual marriage'. My wife had been previously married in a christian church that lasted 11 months and to a brief 2nd husband by a justice of the peace that lasted 3 months.\n I'm not bothered by gays. Don't feel my marriage has been affected by them. It has been affected by your so called conservative christians who pressured my wife into a divorce attempt last year that resulted in her completly losing her faith in organized religions, the demogogues and false prophets and self serving jackles that they are. It's funny how they went about doing it. Pentacostal style reinterpretation of scripture and loophole seeking BS.\n I loved it when I sat in on their service and they'd state they don't believe in divorce yet have a congregation riddled with broken families. State that there are MANY reasons for divorce and remarriage (even though the christ was pretty specific that there was only one) yet never identify those reasons. \n This cost roughly 20% of the wifes income from various tithes and offerings she was cajoled into giving and about $17,000 in seperate living expenses and legal fees. Then, there's plenty of psychological treatment for her broken psyche in dealing with their treatment. Had we gone on, I won the house, I got custody of the youngest child and a whole slew of other victories simply because people of faith are dumb. \n \n edit: bolded beliefs on whatt should be done. As said in a past post, it seems to be a reasonable compromise...doubtful it'd ever happen. This seems to be in line with the past couple of posters.\n I was perfectly happy to have a 'spiritual' marriage with my wife.\n I only LEGALLY married her (cost about $30 to do so including license fees) to ensure legal rights and to adopt children.

If you ain't happy, you not in peace. This IS a reason to leave a spouse...regardless of actual cause. Pretty sweet huh? \n Especially with the double bind hipocracy of saying they don't believe in divorce. Many churches now a days seem to WANT broken people, even make them. A broken person ios easily seperated from their money and anything else with empty promises of fixing the problems.\n \n I have nothing backwards. When jesus said there was one reasopn for divorce and remarriage, he meant one reason. Most evangelicals will over ride this and apply old testiment rules (that should no longer apply) as being over ruled by the Christs own words.\n I think the issue could be that you don't seem to know a lot about evangelicals in a personal way. I could be wrong though.\n Ever hear 'Well, I doubt God wants you to be married'? as an excuse for divorce. I have, straight from the mouth of a oneness pentecostal when I asked him about stances on divorce.\n \n Has nothing to do with an axe to grind, many opposed to evangelism will easily state the hypocracy as the basic foundation of that opposition. The hypocracy was already mentioned in this thread alone. \n \n As for the extermination. I clearly stated why. It's a matter of species and self preservation. While they don't always harp on it, evangelicals desire to spread the 'Word'. They believe this not only as part of a mandate to spread the good news, but to foster conditions and fulfill 'prophesy' to breing about the 'end times' as they currently see it. going on history, when this doens't happen according to plan, they either a) rewrite their plans or b) seek to fulfull the prophesy themselves. Most would have a theocracy in place. I doubt it's be any more merciful, compassionate or just that Sharia law of the Muslims. \n \n \n As to EasyRider,\n Odd, how you were somewhat calm and even bordered on rational when you thought I was one too. Nice of you to be dismissive.\n Others can note, that all a potential charlatan need do is 'learn to speak the language and say pleasing words that tickle the ear.' It's quite revealing your response and how you, in a Michael Moorian fashion, will quote what you please, see what you please. \n \n I still agree that the bible is against gay sexual practices and that the punishment for such is clearly outlined. \n \n @Shadow \" My beef with all of these churches is how they pick and choose what to vocally and vehemently oppose.\"\n \n From my experience and research and even viewing this thread, all Christians are like this. I think it's impossible to follow every lead in the bible. What do you disregard in pursuit of something else. Do you drop the opposition to gays in pursuit of a belief that you're operating in 'Christ like love'? Do you allow false teachers into your churches because 'you shall not judge'. Do you get upset over the perceived sins of others and allow no forgiveness as 'they haven't asked for it'. \n Even scripture states that the devil can quote it. He has, is and will continue to do so. And all Christians will listen. If not to him, then their own desires. So that their ears will be more generously tickled. \n On such a simplistic issue, two sides here beleiving themselves to be Christians differ. I wonder on how many more points of doctrin they will differ to also.",

You made the statement pal, so you own it. There's no backpedaling now, or trying to justify it. EZ is right on this one.\n\n \n I actualy LOVE how now one has addressed the REASON I'd call for such.\n Would you exterminate small pox? \n \n While the specific reason deals with a particular branch of Evangelicalism, there are others currently just as vile. Islamic fundamentalism is evangelical in nature. \n I'm Sure EZ would fight tooth and nail to prevent 'their' evangelistic practices from encroaching upon him or from being forced to live under their law.\n \n From my point of View, there are 3 types of evangelical subsets.\n Like Simone said,\n \n 1) Works Missions. Where Christians go to a location of non-believers and set up humanitarian work...bearing good fruits and all that. They allow their fruit to bear witness to those they seek so as to become a light by deed and not just word. Some countries where they go do prohibit overt prosyletizing. So, they must be approached by those who they seek to convert (even if out of simply human curiosity) before preaching their good news.\n \n 2) Door to Door Missions. You know them. Bang on doors and see if anyone's home. Similar to the 1st, but they don't really do anything. Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses are known for this. Evangelical Christians, mostly unskilled and untrained...hand out little tracts and pamplets. Ever get handed a Jack T. Chick comic? Ever (for non-Christians) think 'Man, how insulting and small minded?' Ever (for Christians) think, 'God, how insulting? Can't they tell I'm ALREADY a Christian, what a waste of money?'\n \n 3) Rabid Bible-thumping Tent Revivalists types. This is what typical 'Evangelicals' are coming to be like in America. They preach to the choir. Exagerate the numbers 'saved', usually back-sliders who need savin' every other day. They put on a good show (like Jerry Springer) for the masses and brag about themselves. Yapping about how they go to X country and (while doing the same there, fleecing followers) convert heathens and bring the werd to the oppressed masses in a 3rd world country (preaching to ignorant hicks). Thus, they need your funds to support their missions. Mostly though, their missions are pleasure trips where they only speak to those who'll hand out wads of cash. \n \n Many of the 3rd claim to be doing the 1st but, often in doing so, they prove themselves to be what Jesus mentioned in Matt. 23:5-12 \"Everything they do is done for men to see...\"\n \n As Matthew S stated, it is their actions. But their actions bear witness to all. \n While their bible prohibits the judging of anothers heart (seldom that that prevent them from doing so though) and, in truth, I have no idea of their intentions, it's hard not to be offended by their actions and stated mandate. \n \n Would you see me in a positive light if I 'said' I was a nice guy but eagerly looked forward to the time when 1/3rd of humanity would be lain to waste, the earth ruined, those who didn't believe and act just Exactly like me tormented?\n Would you if I actively sought to bring this condition about?\n \n I also note some apparent ignorance on the Evangelical vs Christian issue.\n Evangelism is an action upon others.\n Christianity is a belief.\n \n Christianity can lead to evangelicalism but, most Christians aren't. For example, I've known Jo through forums for a few years now. While I often disagree with him, I can respect him. I've also never known him to evangelize beyond explaining his beliefs to others and stating how his faith has come to \n shape his beliefs. He's a 'Christian'...we'll he says he is.\n \n Oh, and for the record, that murderer coming at me with a loaded gun should be exterminated. The pedophile with plans on molesting my kids should be too. Those who are committing genocide should be exterminated. You know, do unto others as they want to do unto you. \n But, then again...I'm Eeeevviiiillll.\n MuAhahahhahahahhahahhahhahah.\n \n @jyoshu, there was no back peddeling. Just ignorance on your behalf. I did't add anything to my previous statement nor take away. In my starement, I fully explained my reason for it. \n \n Seriously, there's no reasoning with them. They actively seek to cause harm in the misguided belief that it's 'good'. They operate out of blind faith and spread that mania to others. They're raised from infancy to be like this and desire to perpetuate it OR, like was mentioned earlier, are 'broken' people...read: naturally bad...and having no inner character cling to a more acceptable addiction, religious mania. Like with drugs, they grow more sick as time goes on. Never knowing balance and tranquility for more than a moment here or there. If they were secure in their faith, they wouldn't feel threatened by something different. Yep, the example of simple homosexual rights demonstrates this. Fear that, some future generation will turn gay if homosexuals are allowed legal rights equivelent to theirs. \n It's already been pointed out that gays can legally engage in all the immorality (even parade it) they desire and there's nothing they can do about it...heck, they don't even press for anti-sodomy laws to be reinstated. Maybe because their false prophet (for profit) pastors like to take it on the 'down low' themselves.\n \n I would like to close with how EZ simply dumped the conversation rather than address any comments, seek to rectify any misconceptions I may have. Defend himself against accusations. He didn't even seek to turn the situation about and...evangelize. \n I also love the compassion and love shown by a couple other Christians here. Jumping on one portion of a comment while ignoring the rest, the more difficult to deal with and underlying reasons. But, I guess liberals and conservatives alike find it easier to denounce rather than understand. Maybe I should do some terroristic actions next time without expressing a reason. 10 to 1 says I'd hear more calls of 'We need to learn and understand where he's coming from...and then blame America before we can move to appease him.'\n \n Yeah, Allah Akbar Mutha Femoticon_xkill \n \n emoticon_xangel\n \n Ironic that the topic of the thread is 'respecting others' beliefs'.",

   "Still, my point hasn't been addressed, that contemporary evangelical (christians) seek the apocalypse, often waxing lyrical at the many diverse forms of torment that those who don't hold to their exact creed will suffer.\n \n There's a fricking BIG line between wanting someone gone simply because of who they were born rather than for the overt choices they make to directly impact anothers life in a proven negative way to that person.\n \n Seriuously, Jyoshu, you're an apostate, you profess Christianity yet really don't even express the love, understanding, compassion and mercy you think is the 'key' issue abvove all others in the scriptures you profess to believe in. You clearly chose which scripture you wish to follow. Apostacy since you've been informed otherwise. \n You're as small minded as EZ.\n \n I've even defined the 3 distinct types of evangelicalism.\n The 1st, Works driven magnetism, is begnin to beneficial. CCF, Various Catholic and Protestant groups often fall into this when they do 'evangelize'. Mother Teresa is a prime example. But, rarely do they do it all the time.\n So, your comment \"Ooh, another anti-evangelical with an axe to grind who thinks there are no good ones. How original.\" has no basis in the reality you want to see. But, you don't want to address any of my real points, you want to feel attacked...my, you must have an axe to grind.\n \n As to opening my mind to your reality of what 'evangelism is'...you haven't even IDENTIFIED it yet here. The version I'm using is the type most here would agree to. Rabid, in your face inflexible do as I say cause this book backs me up or super nasty bad things will happen to you in this life AND when you die, it'll only get worse. This version constitutes all visible and well known forms of evangelism.\n PLUS, the comment was directed to EZ, who was obviously inflammed by it and can't over come his revulsion to such...now he knows how many of his attacked opponents felt by being informed that they'll burn in hell for holding differing beliefs.\n I feel like Paul, rolling in his grave after writing some letters to the Corinthians and finding out that some strange pagan acting heathens who ape christianity are trying to apply it to themselves nearly 2,000 years after the fact.\n \n In the end, you seem to be the one blurring the lines, trying to maybe put yourself into their camp...when the vast majortiy of them would eagerly desire a repressive, intolerant and dogmatic theocratic rule, and just like Sharia law...definatly not allow for your 'heresy'. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Now_theology\n I even doubt your understanding of your own scripture. Maybe you and I could get into a nice scripture throwing war. After all, I seem good enough at it to have convinced EZ that I was a Christian. \n \n When I say they eagerly seek genocide and WORK towards it, that does lumps them FAIRLY into the category of Murderer.\n Still, I have heard no defense against my accusation. Just calls that 'self defense, species defense'...is evil. \n But, if you don't believe this to be true, Or if EZ doesn't believe my accuzations to be true or hold merit, then address them. As it stands, a couple of days have gone by, posts made, yet no one has rebutted them. Silence is complicity, more so when ample calls are made for a defense of the accused. \n \n \n \n \n Oh...and for some of the more younger peoples who often can't get more subtle distinctions, 'Zardoz' comes from the 1970's movie of the same name staring Sean Connery (in red diaper/nappy). It's a sci fi cult classic B style movie where the director took a lot of LSD. In it, there is the great and all powerful ZardoZ, a flying stone head god. From who's mouth spews GUNS...for his followers to 'exterminate' brutals.\n http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:gKgR1yC1wI0J:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zardoz+zardoz&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=3",

I worked for the US gov't for a while, many evangelical style christians loved shoving these things in their correspondences. It's also worth noting that if you were to evangelise in this manner with a competing religion to them, they get disporportionalty upset. \n \n The 3rd type is your fundamentalist. But, it's beyond that. They're charlatains who've perverted the nature and intent of evangelicalism often for their own profit and self agrandizement. In the past 40 years, this movement has expanded upon it's early 1900-1950's roots and subsumed protestantism in the US. Loudly proclaiming they are what God really wanted. Leading well meaning but ignorant people astray. Replacing works with seed sowing (into their coffers) replacing quiet spiritualism with loud emotionalism.\n Watch the documentary Jesus Camp to see young kids being trained for this. \n \n The groups you mentioned are marginalized and were created as a response to 'normal' christianity when said mainstream beliefs treaded too heavily on their toes. Trying to see an attack against the bulk of the harmful nonsense as an attack against the minority of little known, nor cared for sub sects is stretching the imagination. I know EZ would laugh at those groups proclaiming to be 'Christians'. \n It's nothing more than another example of a continuously fractured Church. Your house becomes further divided with each member chasing their own banners. In the end, it won't stand. Already, fewer and fewer Christians read the bible. Fewer even understand it. In a few generations, after the rest of the emotionalism driven 'fundamentalists' wake up to the fact that the promises and prophesies given now by false teachers go unfulfilled, they'll run away to atheism, paganism or continue subdividing the church into smaller groups with further attempts to reconcile the book with their knowledge and what they simply want.",

Why should it matter to you that there are differences? emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n Maybe because It was said in context to a well known evangelist in context of an ongoing conversation. Meant to illustrait how dispicable his overt actions are viewed.\n Maybe because the beneficial 'evangelist' rarely exist. \n Their works that are to help others inadvertantly cause harm. Feeding others rather than teaching them to fish and making them dependent on you, teaching them to fish and disrupting the ecology and economy while doing so. Seeking to convert, doing so and causing division, further strife and bloodshed in the end in the name of religion. Breaking natural social structures as you seek to pull new members to what ever cult you're into. What about those who withhold aid unless conversion is done?\n The 2nd are so annoying that most wouldn't mind seeing them gone. If you're fine with it, PM me you number and address, I'll harasse you or find someone to do so. There's a youtube clip where athiests go door to door in Salt Lake UT. \n The 3rd group...would you have minded if I said 'fundamentalist' rather than evangelical? Seems semantical. After all, not all fundamentalist engage in evangelicalism. \n \n Plus, define yourself as an evangelist.\n Tell me, do you go out into the world and prosyletize?\n Door to Door? Tell others that they should adopt your beliefs?\n \n Somehow, I doubt it with just a casual view of your ongoing comments.\n Those who ARE toletant of others and want the same tolerance in response and rarely, if ever, try to push their beliefs onto others...which is the basis of evangelism. \n If you're into works based faith pushing, tell me, how do you go about doing it? Help at an AIDS Hospice for dying Homosexuals and state that God accepts them as they are and need not change a thing?\n \n Also, what would be the reason for your evangelism?\n Trying to save souls...because your way is THE right way and if you don't their going to burninate for evah?\n Or, like those who protest at soldiers funerals (calvanists) because you're told to do so, even though you know it won't change a thing and you have no real love for it?\n Or, becasue you like to gloat and feel good about yourself as you criticize others and tell them they're going to hell, vinegar dripping from your lips.\n \n Seriously, I'd like to know how you evangelize. Those 'evangelical' web sites I'd say aren't really evangelistic. If they were, they'd have been heard about. Maybe they only have a target audience like Jesus did. You know, the Jews that he was sent for...not the dog nor the gentile. Do they target gays only? Just curious. \n \n Some how, I think you have a faily clean cut and simplistic view of Christianity. Along the lines of Jesus=Love. Doctrin means little beyond that. Dogma less so. Which, naturally wouldn't seem to be the case as far as the bible would seem to state. As for interpretation, no scripture is open for private interpretation. So, if you're just making it up as you go along or only borrowing what you like from Christianity like many New Agers do, why still call yourself a Christian? Is it an identity thing?",

I think, though, when we say evangelical we are speaking of the very out spoken anti gay christians who just happen to be evangelical. So all evangelicals get tagged as anti gay. The crime of the gay accepting chruches, with the exception of the UCC, is that they are not doing enough to fight the antigay stigma that comes with the word evangelical.

   "Astonishing.\n\n \n \n Indeed.\n \n Do you realize your hypocracy yet? It's the greatest seen here by me to date.\n But, rest asured. I've decided to prosyletize also. Yep, evangelizing my beliefs in Zardoz (Gun is good, Penis is bad, go fourth and exterminate the brutals) to the masses. Already, with the cult following of the documentary made of the great stone headed one in the 1970's as a base, hundreds have been recruited for the drive as fresh exterminators.\n \n Already, super secret death squads are following white shirted betied induhviduals on bikes. Oddly dressed phamplet pushers in malls are tailed mercilessly and at night, Witnesses are implanted with microchips, their movements tracked. \n Just like the pimps in the pulpits you follow, I've attended seminars on how to target a market and milk it. My PR firm is already formulating a plan of attack. Starting with political campaigns, I'll engage in a venture risk free campaign to attack this selected group with free TV air time. \n I can start a small store front church of the exterminator and mega size it within 3 years simply because the great Charlie Chaplain has zilch on me. I can pontificate better than Marjoe on crack. I can moon walk, schmooze the honies like T. Dexter and Wonkify the children with cotton candy for their ears. I can use your own script in the same way you leaders do to exploit inbuilt xenophobia and paranoia and forment more unrest and division amongst you.\n I can follow your lead and use contemporary music to lead your kind astray with gyrations of the flesh. I'll scratch every ear, slay every spirit and empty every pocket to keep the mutha ****** ball rolling. \n \n But, why bother? \n You're already dead, nothing but dry bones. Your intellect that of a decayed zombie. Much easier for your to harp on the nonsense than try to dig into the meat. Much like your narrow minded approach to your own scriptures. Sad. \n \n As for the comment on extermination, it's NOT belief...Saying 'I believe' or 'I think' and attacking it is Bull **** and anyone here with any intellectual honesty knows it. EZ is practicing his belief, pushing his creed down the throats of others and part of that DOES entail his made up belief and misinterpretations on a 2nd coming as is commonly pushed in his type of churches. Thus the reason why he hasn't denied it as an agenda AND activity. His vitriol on gays and immoral sinners is far more than I could extress in return. He actively seeks to harm the vast majority of the human race (Buddhists, Muslims, Hindi's and all other religions plus anyone he deems (through a myoptic and heart-reading andfalse interpretation of scripture) sinful and immoral. He needen't broadcast this overtly with word as his actions and refusal to deny it lay witness to the truthfulness of the accusation.\n \n Saying you think or believe something is no where near acting upon those.\n \n As for Jyoshu, he can't even define himself as an evangelical here. \n Pushing your beliefs is evangelicalism. The beliefs can be religious, political, even nonsensical.\n I'm sure more people who profess tolerance and a willingness to understand and seek some recourse would have done better that what's been presented.\n \n And EZ, when you go before your maker (assuming he exists) you going to instantly complain about the sentence you deserve, an eternity in hell OR, are you going to keep your cool, not call for God to be banned and ask for the intervention of the Christ you profess to love and accept his blood as your payment? \n Oh, sorry, that's liberal Christian theology. You'd more likely to follow positive confession and simply demand your place in the kingdom claiming you kept your end of the covenant and God has to keep his.\n \n Any time you want to corrct anything erronious I've stated, as always, feel free.\n Somehow, I think you'll decry more on the 'exterminate' thingy. Much easier.\n Like lamenting the poor, ridiculing the imprisoned and mocking the hungry.\n You know, doing unto the least and all.\n Seriously, I'm all ears. Would love to hear about your good fruits rather than your rightious hatreds. Tell me, what foreign country have you gone to to do humanitarian aid? Worked with Habitate for Humanity building housing for the needy? Done an angel tree at Xmass? How's your prison ministry going? I hear they're a captive audience...\n \n Bueller\n Bueller\n Bueller...\n \n I'd end with some scripture...but, like in church, I'm sure it'd fall on deaf ears.",

   "I smell BS.\n \n I gave 3 distinct types of evangelicals. From begnin and possibly beneficial to malignant and borderline homocidal. \n I seriously doubt that you'd fall into any. You really don't seem to be the 'pusher' type.\n And evangelicals do push. From subvertly seeking an opprotunity to talk about their beliefs to approaching any tom, dick and harry on the street and speaking, at length, about them.\n \n You have ample opprotunity here to spread your good word. I've even stated I'm all ears. Yet, you won't. Thus, you fail the evangelical test. \n You either aren't one, or are so bad at it that you're afraid to embarasse yourself here. More than likely, you do nothing and think yourself active in producing fruit of your faith. \n Just another Christian hypocrit who'd definatly fail his maker and wuss out in any hard test. But, then again, you freely admits to cherry picking your faith.\n \n You also fail to notice that this is a public forum. You're not here for JUST me, but all the viewers who watch. Yep. Not only are gods eyes on you but the fence setters, those who'd support your faith and those who'd oppose it.\n You do nothing to advance your cause. So, when called to task and asked to explain yourself you'd rather stay silent. Because it's convienant? Because it's too hard? \n Most assuredly I tell you the truth, you can not follow without crucifying your own flesh, dying to yourself and being born again of the Christ Jesus. Thus, it shouldn't be you who's speaking but Jesus through you. This isn't denying the Christ so as to save your neck as Peter did. This is chickening out because...?\n Why not testify. Let the truth condemn me rather than my ignorance as you believe. \n \n Just as EZ refuses to deny my accusations, you want to own the term evangelicalism yet won't say how. \n Seriously, all EZ has to do is deny the accusation. That he isn't actively seeking the 2nd coming, working towards it himself and looking into his own heart, doesn't get a boner thinking about how god's gonna smack down the unrightious. That he doesn't support those who believe that god's given a mission in the middle east, messing with the Babylonians and positioning the US to be supporters in Megiddo. It's not just the evangelicals beliefs, it's their way they self fulfill their versions of prophesy. If they'd just go drink flavor aid or hide in a cave, no one would care. It's their active desire to 'make things happen'. That's the concern. Odd how after all this rabble rousing, no, \"Man, that's crazy Zardoz. I don't belive that.\" \n \n \n This has nothing to do with grinding an axe.\n More to do with pointing out hypocracy.\n Proverbs 17:9\n \n And, in seeking to own this persecution of mine as you believe it to be, pray tell me, have you followed any scripture? Have you followed your own beliefs? Have you prayed for me? Matt. 5:43-48\n \n \n \n But, give up if you want. You really don't know me let alone know why I've stated what I did to EZ. As for knowing about evangelicals or most of any religion type, I'd hazard a guess I've got far more experience and knowledge than you.",

Jesus replied, \" 'Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother,'and 'love your neighbor as yourself.'[/b] \" \"All these I have kept,\" the young man said. \"What do I still lack?\" Jesus answered, \"If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.

Unless you have taken up heretical views on the doctrine on the trinity aswell.\n\n \n I think you need to understand this better, so here is more:\n \n Jesus is the same one / God who gave Moses the Law at Mt. Sinai. To understand this you have to dig into \"The Angel of the Lord\" connections.\n \n The Angel of the Lord\n \n In the Burning Bush episode it was \"THE Angel of the Lord\" who spoke with Moses. \"Angel\" in that passage can certainly mean messenger (as opposed to a strict angel) since the same Hebrew word is also used as messenger in Malachi 3:1 (\"Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, will come,\" says the LORD Almighty.\" \n \n Here, the \"messenger\" is the Lord they are seeking who will come to the temple, which is also a Messianic passage.\n \n \"The testimony of the early Fathers on the theophanies of Christ in the Old Testament is full and conclusive.\n \n Justin Martyr declared: \"Our Christ conversed with Moses out of the bush, in the appearance of fire. And Moses received great strength from Christ, who spake to him in the appearance of fire.\"\n \n Irenaeus wrote: \"The Scripture is full of the Son of God's appearing: sometimes to talk and eat with Abraham, at other times to instruct Noah about the measures of the ark; at another time to seek Adam; at another time to bring down judgment upon Sodom; then again, to direct Jacob in the way; and again, to converse with Moses out of the bush.\" \n \n Tertullian stated, \"It was the Son who judged men from the beginning, destroying that lofty tower, and confounding their languages, punishing the whole world with a flood of waters, and raining fire and brimstone upon Sodom and Gomorrah, the Lord pouring it down from the Lord: for he always descended to hold converse with men, from Adam even to the patriarchs and prophets, in visions, in dreams, in mirrors, in dark sentences, always preparing his way from the beginning: neither was it possible, that God who conversed with men upon earth, could be any other than that Word which was to be made flesh.\" \n \n Quotations from Richard Watson, Theological Institutes, I, 501,502. Watson also cites Clemens Alexandrinus, Origen, Theophilus of Antioch, the synod of Antioch, Cyprian, Hilary, St. Basil, and others as holding the same viewpoint of theophanies of Christ in the Old Testament. \n \n Judges 13:20-22 \n 20 For it came about when the flame went up from the altar toward heaven, that the ANGEL of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell on their faces to the ground. \n 21 Now the ANGEL of the LORD did not appear to Manoah or his wife again. Then Manoah knew that he was the ANGEL of the LORD. \n 22 So Manoah said to his wife, \"We will surely die, for we have seen God.\"\n \n Zechariah 3:1 Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before THE angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right side to accuse him. 2 The LORD said to Satan, \"The LORD rebuke you, Satan! The LORD, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a burning stick snatched from the fire?\" 3 Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel. 4 THE Angel (of the Lord) said to those who were standing before him, \"Take off his filthy clothes.\" Then he (The Angel of the Lord) said to Joshua, \"See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put rich garments on you.\" \n \n There are many examples of this \"Angel\" in the OT. I seem to recall that this Angel is known as the \"Jehovah Angel\". And I don't recall if it is all, but in a great many of them everytime you see this Angel in action, he is doing things that God is known to do, like forgiving sin, etc. \n \n http://preceptaustin.org/angel_of_the_lord.htm\n \n More examples from another site:\n \n He promises to multiply Hagar's seed, and she confesses, \"You are a God who sees\" (Gen.16:10,13). \n \n The messenger called unto Abraham, saying, \"By myself I have sworn, says Jehovah\" (Gen. 22:15,16). \n \n He said to Jacob, \"I am the God of Bethel\" (Gen. 31:11,13). \n \n It was this messenger who wrestled with Jacob (cf. \"angel\" Hos. 12:4) at Peniel, and yet the sacred text identifies this person as God (Gen. 32:28-30; Hos. 12:3-5).\n \n The messenger attributed to himself the divine oath (Jdg. 2:1-3). \n This \"prince of Jehovah\" accepted worship, and spoke as God (Josh. 5:13-6:2; cf. Jdg. 6:19-27).",

   "Matthew 1:20-25\n But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, \"Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. he will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.\" All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: \"The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel\"-which means, \"God with us.\" When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.\n \n Mary was with child when AN angel of the Lord came to visit already.\n \n You saying, the (essence) of Jesus wasn't in her womb even though she was pregnant at that time yet? \n Then, this would support that the unborn child has no soul from moment of conception and it would be more easily argued that abortion is acceptable. \n Otherwise, how could the angel of the Lord (whom you like a Jehovah's Witness erroniously believe is Jesus) and Jesus (in the womb) exist simultaneously in 2 different points (which should be impossible as when the was made flesh, it stayed flesh until after the crucification).\n \n I could go on and say AN means one of many. For why say AN when you should say THE. \n \n \n Furher more a messenger isn't THE MESSAGE, which is what the christ was.\n The 'messenger' (melakr means prophet) refered to in Mal 3:1 is the one in Matthew 10:11 It's John the Baptist.

   "Behold, I will send my messenger [mal'ak, the Hebrew word for \"angel\"], and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger [again, the Hebrew word is mal'ak] of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts. But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap: And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness. (Mal. 3:1-3)\n \n There, the Lord IS the \"messenger\" (mal'ak). It's quite clear.\n \n Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him. But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries. For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off. (Ex. 23:20-23)\n \n And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night. (Ex. 13:21)\n \n And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me. . . . And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son: That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice. (Gen. 22:11, 12, 15-18)\n \n To Abraham also this \"Angel\" spoke as God Himself.\n \n \n But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD. And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God. But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these. (Jdg. 13:21-23)\n \n Manoah said specifically that the \"Angel\" was God (\"we have seen God\").\n \n \n And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire? Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel. And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment. (Zec. 3:1-4)\n \n Only God can forgive sins, yet this mal'ak is forgiving sins.\n \n http://www.pickle-publishing.com/papers/angel-yahweh.htm",

(Mal. 3:1-3)\n \n There, the Lord IS the \"messenger\" (mal'ak). It's quite clear.\n\n \n As I said, the same quote is used in Mark 1:2-4 as in Mal 3:1 thus, they are talking about the same issue, John the Baptist here, a prophet who prepared the way. \n See also Haggie 1:13. Where it's used as a word for a prophet(s). Or in Isaiah 42:19 and :26.\n \n \n \n As for the angel of the lord in the other verses, (like in Gen 16:7) it means an angel who speaks FOR the lord. [Metatron, messenger sent from heaven in some parlance]. However, as you stated, it could be a preincarnate Jesus. \n The problem is that the same word is used interchangably for several entities. The one you follow seems to want to use it to mean the same thing in all occasions. No?\n \n \n Context.\n \n The problems are when one word can mean many different things, more so in translations. This problem is often compounded when more modern and oft less educated preachers wish it to mean something different than intended.\n I've sat in services where a pastor repeatedly states to the congregation that \"the word here 'X' actually mans 'Y' in the original language\". \n Often twisting context to mean something different, objectively it seems to support a private agenda such as when \"honor thy father and mother commandment\" is twisted to mean \"honor thy spiritual father\" ie. Him. Then rolls it into a sermon on how their 'man of god' should be treated (very well). \n Odd how someone with limited skill and education, little to no knowledge of biblical history nor of languages wishes themselves to 'have the right translation' when over 1,000 years worth of scholars and religious persons have formed a consistant translation that's been presented. Often using nothing more than Youngs/ Strongs concordance and the prompting of a visiting charlatan of success as their only guide.\n \n 2 Corinthians 11:4",

I do have an opinion but fully believe that I do not know nor can I prove the answer to whether or not a person is gay by heredity or choice. My arguments here are not about gays but the unbelievable illogic in the bullets above.\n \n 1) animal homosexuality is only anecdotal. Given regular access to opposite sex partners animals almost always \"choose\" them. Occasionally they do not. However, it is hardly a lifelong venture for them.\n 2)NOt sure of what this means or why you bring it up. If people are not naturally attracted to the opposite sex only begs the question of \"natural attraction.\" there is too much left unsaid to establish an appropriate argument\n 3)People frequently choose to do things that cause them agonies and do illogical and silly things (not that coming out of the closet is either). Merely pointing out the fact that this is not exclusive and does not explain the issue at all.\n 4)This is just ridiculous. The same success rate can be said of teenagers whose parents require them to go into therapy for a drug addiction. It does not prove the lack of choice, it only points to the potential recalcitrance of the individual. Baaaaaaaaaaaaaad Logic on this one.\n 5)I point you to my post where I know, personally three people who used to be gay. They were never bisexual and never had a desire for those of the opposite sex. Until the time when they did declare that they were, in fact, no longer gay and making a choice to be hetero.\n 6) There is also a biological component to alcoholism as well. Should we stop treatment programs and tell them that they are just fine?\n \n Again, please do not hear me as being against gay people. I am far from it. I do not necessarily believe any of the points I make. I only point out the fallacies of logic. Posts such as this one only actually make it harder for gay folks to live as the arguments are just so poorly constructed. They are ripe for counter.\n \n As I said, I know three people personally who were gay and I am very sensitive to the struggles they faced both as a gay person and a person who was gay. Ridicule comes from both sides.\n \n Huck.",

There is definitely a genetic element there, but to say that all gay and lesbian people were born that way is pure BS.\n \n The upbringing and the environment likely have more to do with habits than most people think. Our need to protect children of both genders from perverted molesters of both genders is higher than ever before. \n \n Of course the gay men will say, \"The devil made me do it!\" to nix the idea that their behavior wasn't assigned to them at birth.

We are not born with sexual attraction. As we pass into sexual maturity at puberty, those attractions emerge. It appears that they are likely due to a combination of genetics and environment. Also it appears that, although the outward expression of that orientation occurs in puberty, our orientation is set by early childhood. What these environmental factors are is unclear at this time. It appears that what is not an environmental factor is the simple verbal or non-verbal encouragement, suggestion, education or cajoling of others. This should be obvious because the same proportion of homosexuality occurs both in societies that have oppressive and permissive attitudes toward homosexuality. \n \n I can choose to rob a bank.

   "If anything, your last point makes the Bible more likely to be accurate - a people with an oral tradition are likely to have a better memory for events than those who can rely on writings and pictures for support. In any case, while the books included in the Bible date from some years after Jesus' death, there is some evidence of older documents that have since been lost (the hypothesised 'Q' being the obvious example).\n\n I would agree with you to some extent: A people with the habit of remembering things rather than relying on written material would have a better chance of remembering detail, but it would only be the true story tellers (Shamans, Druids etc) who would be trained to remember speech verbatim. The people we are talking about were fishermen, tax collectors and the likes, so they would not have remembered that much detail over those kinds of lengths of time. I am also aware that there are older texts that have been lost to us and that there are many many texts that did not make it into the Bible despite their having been written at roughly the same time.\n \n But let's take a look at the accuracy of memory regarding the stories that are told in the Bible. We could look at arguably the most important story of all, the Christmas Story.\n \n Let's start with Herod, who was supposed to have intercepted the wise men and plotted to do away with the newly born Jesus. There is plenty of evidence that Herod actually died in 4 BC, though I have heard dates ranging from 25 BC up to 1 BC.\n \n This text also suggests that Jesus was born around 6 BC, suggesting that Herod would not have been looking for a newly born Jesus at all, rather a boy of around 2 years.\n \n This one mentions 1 BC, but then gives arguments against it and seems to settle on 4 BC.\n \n And this one rambles on for ages about evidence for and against 4 BC and 1 BC.\n \n Now I realise that the Bible makes no mention of the year of Jesus' birth, and indeed it could not reasonably be expected to. But there's more.\n \n We can also examine the real identity of the bright star that led the wise men to Bethlehem. Was it an actual star? - unlikely as they tend not to move around and are also not visible during the day (other than our sun, obviously). Was it a meteorite? - also unlikely as they tend to zip across the sky in seconds, not several days/weeks. However, a comet fits all the criteria - visible during the day, lasts for days/weeks, moves fairly slowly, tends to look like a pointy thing. Coincidentally, Halley's comet appeared around about 2000 years ago, and it is widely believed that this was the star in question. But Halley's comet appeared in 11 BC (5 years before Jesus is now believed to have been born and 7 years before Herod is reported to have died). This is all included in this article, which goes into a fair bit of detail on the possibilities of star/planet/metoerite/super nova etc. It does mention another possibility. There was a 'great conjunction' in late 7 BC. Jupiter and Saturn appeared in the sky and would have been visible for several months. So that seems possible.\n \n But there is another problem. Joseph and Mary went to Bethlehem to . . . .\n \n I'll let the good book do the talking\n \n And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed. (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem (because he was of the house and lineage of David); To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. (Luke 2:1-6) \n \n But there was no census at that time. Not 6 BC, 4 BC, 1 BC, 1 AD. In fact, not until 6-7 AD, a good 12 years after Jesus was now supposed to have been born. Either that or Mary was certainly 'being great with child'.\n \n So this 'story teller' (Luke - remember he wasn't trained as such), who probably wrote this story many decades after the death of Jesus, seems to have put together events that ranged in time from 6 BC to 6 AD (possibly 11 BC to 7 AD) and wrote a very nice story. That is what happens when a community hands down stories from one generation to the next, they change. But it doesn't matter because to all intents and purposes they are as true as they need to be.\n \n The problems arise when someone centuries later says words to the effect, 'If you don't believe what I believe, then you are a heritic, and must die'.\n \n When you put historical fact up against a nice story and there are fundamental differences, then faith or no faith, something has to give.\n \n \nIrrelevant given that what we have is, well, what we have. It's not like that fact alone negates the accuracy of the events reported. \n \n I always find it interesting that critics of the Bible seem to completely write off oral tradition as holding historical value.

It's as if we should assume everything our grandparents tell us that their parents told us is wrong, and write it off as useless because it happens to not be on paper.\n\n \n Irrelevant? I hardly think that saying, 'we've got what we've got' is a good argument as to the accuracy of a persons words.\n \n I also did not say that oral tradition holds no historical value, merely that it cannot be held up as completely accurate, especially when it comes to verbatim speech reported by those not trained to remember things with such accuracy. I think my 'Christmas Story' did something to put that into perspective.\n \n Do you really think that a fisherman would remember a speech word for word some 50-70 year later?\n \n If you like we could try something out. Can you remember (without looking it up) the exact words of the news reporters who reported the 9/11 disaster? I have no idea what you do (I assume you're not a shaman), but you would probably have just as much chance of remember a significant event from some 5 or so years ago as a fisherman would remembering events (far less significant) from several decades ago.\n \n And just out of interest, how often do your grandparents repeat conversations they had 50-70 years ago, and can you be 100% sure of their accuracy?\n \n Smiley emoticon_xangel",

Either that or Mary was certainly 'being great with child'.\n\n \n This is a tired, old argument that has been addressed ad nauseum, in these threads and other sites.\n \n William Ramsey noted (NBD, s.v. \"Quirinius\"): \n \n \"The possibility that Quirinius may have been governor of Syria on an earlier occasion (*Chronology of the NT) has found confirmation in the eyes of a number of scholars (especially W. M. Ramsay) from the testimony of the Lapis Tiburtinus (CIL, 14. 3613). This inscription, recording the career of a distinguished Roman officer, is unfortunately mutilated, so that the officer's name is missing, but from the details that survive he could very well be Quirinius. It contains a statement that when he became imperial legate of Syria he entered upon that office 'for the second time' (Lat. iterum). The question is: did he become imperial legate of Syria for the second time, or did he simply receive an imperial legateship for the second time, having governed another province in that capacity on the earlier occasion?...The wording is ambiguous. Ramsay held that he was appointed an additional legate of Syria between 10 and 7 bc, for the purpose of conducting the Homanadensian war, while the civil administration of the province was in the hands of other governors, including Sentius Saturninus (8-6 bc), under whom, according to Tertullian (Adv. Marc. 4. 19), the census of Lk. 2:1ff. was held.\n \n Under either of these scenarios, SOMEONE served twice, and under either of these scenarios, Quirinius could EASILY have been responsible for the census. \n \n And curiously enough, even if that were NOT the case somehow, the linguistic data of the last few decades indicates that Luke 2.1 should be translated 'BEFORE the census of Quirinius' instead of the customary 'FIRST census of Quirinius'--see Nigel Turner, Grammatical Insights into the New Testament, T&T Clark: 1966, pp. 23,24 and Syntax, p. 32. This would 'solve the problem' without even requiring two terms of office for Q. \n And, while we are talking about Greek here...the term Luke uses for Quirinius' 'governorship' is the VERY general term hegemon, which in extra-biblical Greek was applied to prefects, provincial governors, and even Caesar himself. In the NT it is similarly used as a 'wide' term, applying to procurators--pilate, festus, felix--and to general 'rulers' (Mt 2.6). [The New Intl. Dict. of New Test. Theology (ed. Brown) gives as the range of meaning: \"leader, commander, chief\" (vol 1.270)...this term would have applied to Quirinius at MANY times in his political career, and as a general term, Syria would have had several individuals that could be properly so addressed at the same time. Remember, Justin Martyr called him 'procurator' in Apology 1:34, which is also covered by this term.] My point is...nothing is really out of order here... \n \n http://www.christian-thinktank.com/quirinius.html\n \n Census:\n \n The Deeds of the Divine Augustus \n \n By Augustus \n \n Written 14 A.C.E. \n \n Translated by Thomas Bushnell, BSG \n \n 8. When I was consul the fifth time (29 B.C.E.), I increased the number of patricians by order of the people and senate. I read the roll of the senate three times, and in my sixth consulate (28 B.C.E.) I made a census of the people with Marcus Agrippa as my colleague. I conducted a lustrum, after a forty-one year gap, in which lustrum were counted 4,063,000 heads of Roman citizens. Then again, with consular imperium I conducted a lustrum alone when Gaius Censorinus and Gaius Asinius were consuls (8 B.C.E.), in which lustrum were counted 4,233,000 heads of Roman citizens. And the third time, with consular imperium, I conducted a lustrum with my son Tiberius Caesar as colleague, when Sextus Pompeius and Sextus Appuleius were consuls (14 A.C.E.), in which lustrum were cunted 4,937,000 of the heads of Roman citizens. By new laws passed with my sponsorship, I restored many traditions of the ancestors, which were falling into disuse in our age, and myself I handed on precedents of many things to be imitated in later generations.\n \n You see there was a census taken of the entire roman empire. This census was taken in 8 BCE. Evidence doesn't get any stronger than this. \n \n http://classics.mit.edu/Augustus/deeds.html\n \n Papyri collected in Egypt, have shown that the Romans undertook periodic censuses throughout their empire. In Roman Egypt, for example, from A.D. 33 until 257 A.D., 258 different censuses were taken at 14-year intervals. This evidence has been known for a number of years, and substantiates Luke's reference to Augustus' census, but it seems to work against the Lucan account in terms of the year when Jesus was born. Why? Because the 14-year intervals do not intersect with the year of Jesus' birth in 4 B.C. \n \n But concerning that problem, the Dictionary of New Testament Background [Craig Evans and Stanley Porter, eds., InterVarsity, 2000] states: \"Evidence indicates that Egyptian censuses were taken at 7-year intervals during the reign of Augustus and can be established with indirect and direct evidence for the years of 11-10 B.C., 4-3 B.C., A.D. 4 and 5, and A.D. 11 and 12.\" This information is based on documentation presented in The Demography of Roman Egypt by Bagnell and Friar, a book published by Cambridge University Press in 1994.\n \n Next, what about the criticism that in a Roman census Joseph would not have been required to travel to Bethlehem and he would not have been required to bring Mary with him? Well, now historians have found that in A.D. 104, Vivius Maximus issued an edict that states, \"It is essential for all people to return to their homes for the census.\" \n \n http://www.ankerberg.com/Articles/editors-choice/EC1205W3C.htm",

   "For another view of that....\n \n Simcha Jacobovici's TV documentary, The Exodus Decoded, attempts to align the Israelite Exodus from Egypt with the Hyksos Expulsion. He suggests a date of 1500 BC for this event. The problem? 1 Kings 6:1 suggests for some scholars that the Exodus was 1446 BC, noting Solomon's 4th year [when the Bible says Solomon began building the Temple-Ed.] is 966 BC and the elapsed time from the Exodus to this date was 480 years. Jacobovici, in an apparently off-camera interview with Kenneth A. Kitchen, an Egyptologist, was cautioned that Ahmose's reign could not be lowered to 1446 BC \"to fit\" 1 Kings 6:1. The lowest it could be lowered to was 1525 BC. Apparently Jacobovici decided on his own authority to move the Hyksos Expulsion and Israelite Exodus to 1500 BC, to make it \"somewhat closer\" to Ahmose's time.\n \n What Jacobovici is apparently unaware of is that Kitchen, in studying the 1446 BC Exodus date preserved in 1 Kings 6:1, had determined in 1992 and 2003 that the figure of 480 years elapsing between the Exodus [and the start of the Temple construction] was contradicted by the texts. Kitchen: \"The lazy man's solution is simply to cite the 480 years ostensibly given in 1 Kings 6:1 from the Exodus to the 4th year of Solomon (ca. 966 BC). However, this too simple solution is ruled out by the combined weight of all the other biblical data plus additional information from external data. So the interval of time from the Exodus comes out not at 480 years but as over 553 years (by three unknown amounts), if we trouble to go carefully through all the known biblical figures for this period. It is evident that the 480 years cannot cover fully the 553 years + X years. At the best, it could be a selection from them, or else it is a schematic figure (12 x 40 yrs., or similar).\" (p. 702, Vol. 2. K. A. Kitchen. \"The Exodus,\" in David Noel Freedman, Ed., Anchor Bible Dictionary, New York: Doubleday, 1992). \n \n Still later, Kitchen suggested that a period of 591/596 years elapsed between the Exodus and Solomon's 4th year according to chronologies preserved in the book of Judges, that is, when the different reigns are added up sequentially (but he favors that some of the reigns are concurrent, not sequential): \"This possibility becomes in effect a certainty if one goes through the date lines between the Exodus and the fourth year of Solomon, the year he began to build his temple, \"in the 480th year\" since the Exodus (1 Kings 6:1), we are told. Thus, if that year fell circa 967 (cf. dates in chapters 2 and 4 above), a literal adding up would set the Exodus in 1447. But if we take the trouble to actually tote up all the individual figures known from Exodus to Kings in that period, they do not add up to 480 years. But rather to 544+x+y+z years, where x= unknown length by Joshua and the elders 544+x+y+ (minimum, 5/10 years?), y= rule by Samuel above his stated 20 years (possibly zero), and z= the full reign of Saul (minimum, [3]2 years). The total comes to between 35 and 42 years at least, bringing the 554 years to a minimal 591/596 years. This is certainly not identical with the 480 years of 1 Kings 6:1.\" (pp. 202-203, Kenneth Andrew Kitchen, On the Reliability of the Old Testament, Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans, 2003).\n \n James Hoffmeier (an Egyptologist who appeared in The Exodus Decoded), in reviewing a history of attempts to pinpoint the date of the Exodus, mentions the work of Jack (James W. Jack, The Date of the Exodus in the Light of External Evidence, Edinburgh, Scotland: T & T Clark, 1925): \"...James Jack argued for a mid-fifteenth century date based on biblical data and what he believed to be corroborating Egyptian evidence. Based on the Masoretic text of 1 Kings 6:1, which dates the departure from Egypt at 480 years before Solomon's fourth regnal year, Jack concluded that 1445 BC was the Exodus date since Solomon's accession date, 970 BC, could be securely fixed (his fourth year being 966/967), thanks to synchronisms between Biblical and Assyrian texts\" (p.124, James K. Hoffmeier, Israel in Egypt, The Evidence for the Authenticity of the Exodus Tradition, New York: Oxford University Press, 1996). Hoffmeier also observed that Jack was aware that a \"careful reading\" of the Masoretic texts revealed an elapsed period exceeding 480 years: \"However, as Jack showed, if all the periods are added together, such as the forty years in Sinai, the lengths of the Judges, and periods of peace between the Judges, plus the length of David's reign, the total is 534 years. On top of this figure, the duration of Joshua's leadership in Canaan and the length of Saul's kingship, which are not preserved, bring the total close to six hundred years.\" (Hoffmeier, p. 125). \n \n If we add Kitchen's 591/596 years or Hoffmeier's 600 years to Solomon's 967 BC, we come up with Exodus dates of 1558/1563 BC or 1567 BC. Pharaoh Ahmose I, who expelled the Hyksos, is dated by Clayton ca. 1570-1546 BC (p. 100. \"Ahmose I,\" in Peter A. Clayton. Chronicle of the Pharaohs, London: Thames & Hudson. 1994). Thus using the \"findings\" of Kitchen and Hoffmeier regarding 1 Kings 6:1, an Exodus in the days of Pharaoh Ahmose I seems possible. However, neither of these men understand the Exodus to be the Hyksos expulsion; they opt instead for a Rameside Exodus ca. 1260 BC, despite the research they did on 1 Kings 6:1 revealing that the Bible \"preserves an earlier date\" for the Exodus.\n \n Not considered by Kitchen or Hoffmeier is the date for the Exodus as \"preserved\" in the New Testament Book of Acts (they restricted their research solely to the Old Testament). Acts 13:18-21: \"And for about forty years he bore with them in the wilderness. And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years. And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. Then they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king...\"(Revised Standard Version, Bruce M. Metzger & Herbert G. May, editors. The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha, 1977).\n \n The above verse suggests that after 40 years wandering by Israel under Moses, Israel is in possession of the Promised land for 450 years, then Judges are given to Israel, then Saul rules for 40 years. According to 1 Kings 2:10-11, David reigned 40 years. And the Temple was built in Solomon's fourth year. Thus we have 40+450+40+40+4= 574 years elapsing from the Exodus to Solomon's fourth year, contra 1 Kings 6:1 stating that 480 years elapsed. Solomon's 4th year being fixed by some scholars as 966/967 BCE + 574 years= 1540/1541 in the days of Pharaoh Ahmose I who expelled the Hyksos.\n \n Lamsa's English translation of the Aramaic Bible renders Acts 13:17-22 thusly, suggesting 450 years elapsed under the Judges: \"The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers and exalted and multiplied them when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with a strong arm he brought them out of it. And he fed them in the wilderness for forty years, and he destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, and he gave them their land for an inheritance. And for a period of four hundred and fifty years he gave them judges until the time of the prophet Samuel. Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for a period of forty years. And when in time God took Saul away he raised up to them David to be their king...\" (George M. Lamsa, Translation of the Aramaic Text of the Peshitta. Holy Bible From the Ancient Eastern Text. Harper & Row San Francisco. [1933], 1968)\n \n I note that according to 1 Kings 2:10-11, David reigned 40 years: \"So David rested with his forefathers and was buried in the city of David, having reigned over Israel for forty years...\"\n We are told that in the fourth year of Solomon the Temple was begun (1 Kings 6:1) and that 480 years elapsed from the Exodus to this event. Some scholars date the 4th years of Solomon as either 966 or 967 BCE. Many Christian Protestant scholars often add 480 years to 966 BCE and get an Exodus ca. 1446 BCE.\n \n So, when we add up the totals from Acts 13:18-21, 1 Kings 2:10-11, and 1 Kings 6:1 we have 40 yrs in the Wilderness, 450 years to Saul, 40 yrs for Saul's reign, 40 yrs for David's reign, 4 yrs for Solomon to the temple, for a grand total of 574 years between the Exodus and the Temple's founding. Add this to 966/967 BCE when the Temple was begun, and we have 1540/1541 BCE for the Exodus date.\n \n http://www.bib-arch.org/bswbOOexodus_Mattfeld.html",

   "I'm still completely lost as to what your point is here. It's either circular reasoning, or you're agreeing with me that the veracity of texts in the Bible, or other historical texts regarding the supernatural which some may also believe to be divinely inspired, cannot be proven to the same degree. \n I don't need to understand the belief in God, or to believe in God, in order to test the veracity of an ancient text, the Bible included. The claim of divine inspiration, and even the faith in the inspiration, has no affect on the veracity of the text from a historical perspective. It is, as you state, simply a matter of faith.\n You can state that you have faith in the accuracy of the texts, but in no way can you state that they are historically accurate beyond that without some sort of evidence. \n They won't be relevent from any point of view but your own, regardless of whether the one questioning them is atheistic, Buddhist, or a scientologist.\n \n What I refer to as historical accuracy are texts that can be verified through other sources, be that direct archeological evidence, corroborating texts from other writers, or more specifically, other cultures with no vested interest in the veracity of the text in question, etc... I'm actually quite open to the possibility that there are many aspects of the Bible that are historically accurate, at least to some degree, including a historical Jesus in some form or another. However, IMHO, to treat it as in infallible history text book is rather absurd.\n\n I haven't said that the scriptures are an \"infallible history text book\". That's your spin on the topic being discussed, and tantamount to misrepresentation. The Christian believes scripture presents reasonable and coherent ideas about the nature and will of God. Christian beliefs arising from reading the scriptures do not lie only in the content of the text itself, but in the individual's subjective encounter with the text.\n \n A number of Patristic quotes could be mustered to show that the early Christian fathers understood the gospels as historical accounts on which they could reliably base the elucidation of doctrine from the words and deeds of Jesus of Nazareth himself. And modern New Testament scholarship has assembled an enormous amount of ancient manuscript evidence. The documentary evidence for the New Testament surpasses any other work of its time. Among a great number of manuscripts, many are dated within a few years of their authors' lives. Are they all elaborating a mere myth? \n \n Doubting the New Testament's reliability as a historical document arises from the questions of who Jesus was and what he said and did. Other contemporary historical figures, about whom the evidence might be dubious, do not of course excite the same scrutiny. So the main difficulty here, which I have not pretended does not exist, is the fact that supernatural phenomena are described frequently in the gospels. I have said that dissolving this difficulty ultimately involves recourse to faith. That's not a dodge to avoid the issue, it's simply a reminder that you either believe or you don't believe. \n \nI notice that things come down to a \"worldview\" often in your posts. I believe in what I can see and verify within reason, if that's what you mean by a scientific world view. I have difficulty in ascribing to a \"worldview\" that allows one to dismiss logic, reality, and objectivity in favour of the supernatural and illogical.\n\n Why are you so sensitive about my reference to your worldview? Almost every intelligent person develops one. I have simply acknowledged that, from your perspective, the scriptures lack evidentiary force because you do not recognise their authority. Sceptics usually question the factuality of the gospels because of the miracles: this is a question of worldviews Those who have a naturalistic worldview do not believe an omnipotent creator exists. All that exists are energy and matter; therefore, miracles are impossible. Their inevitable conclusion is that reports of miracles in the gospels are exaggerations, delusions, or myths. \n \n Although it is a common assumption that the scientific, rationalist worldview is the only one that could possibly be correct, there is no such thing as a view from nowhere. It follows that a failure to substantiate naturalistic atheism (which I've inferred is your default position) is as potentially damaging as anyone else's failure to substantiate theism.\n \n You seem to imply that in developing a different \"world view\" from yours, I have abandoned logic and objectivity? Would I be correct in surmising that you think theists are irrational people? Isn't that a tad offensive?\n \n \nOK, it's becoming a little clearer where you're coming from, and quite frankly, I don't want to go there, the road leads directly to a discussion of whether or not God exists. \n \n Additionally, many of those texts were not considered secular by those that wrote them, that's your \"worldview\" affecting your interpretation of them.\n \n At least you're coming at it from a matter of faith, and not from the point of view that you can prove the veracity of scripture to a reasonable degree, or that it is in fact divinely inspired.\n \n\n No, I don't think you do understand \"where I'm coming from\", because my route to theism is not dependant primarily on the testimony of the scriptures. But since you don't want to go down that road, I don't need to give my reasons.\n \n You keep asking for proof, but of course I cannot \"prove\" what you desire. Can anyone \"prove\" the contrary? What is a \"reasonable degree\"? The scriptures are believed to be divinely inspired but whether they \"really\" are, could never be a proven fact since the belief itself belongs in the realm of metaphysical discourse. \n \n The accounts of the life and works of Jesus Christ in the gospels are not free from inaccuracy. We do not have the original manuscripts and there are textual discrepancies. But these differences are minor and do not affect any major theological doctrine. \n \n James.",

   "Though the independent references are very few, I have reasons to be as confident about the existence of Jesus Christ as I am about the existence of his contemporary, King Herod.\n\n I would very much appreciate your citing these 'independent references'.

Let's put this to the test, shall we, and examine exactly what JH is saying by adding in what he's analogizing, effectively dealing with the claims. (after all, in this case the analogy IS a claim, just using analogy as a means).\n \n \"The evidence for Jesus is more along the lines of our\" ... \n \n 1. possessing several second-hand accounts of [Jesus] \n \n 2. but with no actual copies of the [Jesus' sayings or a gospel] in existence, \n \n 3. or any disinterested evidence that they were ever performed. \n \n In dealing with these ...\n \n Point #1 - There are plenty of ancient figures we generally accept as having lived, of which we go by what would be considered second-hand accounts. (Certain pharoahs, leaders of civilizations, other religions' leaders, etc.) Ironically here, a LOT of writings we have from antiquity are \"second hand\"! From the law of Hammurabi to accounts of Roman leaders, it is rare to find an original record, but rather we glean a lot of our information from what is said about them in '2nd hand accounts.'\n \n Point #2 - What the heck is an 'actual copy' of Jesus' sayings or a gospel supposed to be? Does that mean the FIRST draft? The orginal piece of papyrus that it was written on? And if we're talking about sayings of Jesus here, how is it possible to have the \"actual copy\" of that? Even the first time they were written down it would have not been the original--the original was verbal. Unless there is evidence that the sayings were changed from an earlier source, then there is no reason to believe they were changed. So with that said, why should we assume that what is recorded in the gospels of his sayings are not \"actual copies' (in the sense of his actual words) of what he said?\n \n Point #3 - This, to me, is the most surprising criteria of all. \"Disinterested\" evidence? Since when do we require evidence for someone's existence only acceptable if the person writing about it is disinterested? Do we only accept biographies if the author had no admiration of the subject he or she is writing about? No--in fact the interest actually helps the biography! I can think of no other matter other than the Christian writings where only 'disinterested' sources are allowed!\n \n So in answer to your question Obvious_Child, it appears that it's not the 'Christians' who have a double standard about this sort of thing, but those who are constantly holding Christian writings to a much more speculative standard than other ancient writings. Furthermore, Hanks throws in \"100 years after the events\" as evidence Jesus didn't really exist, which is just downright flabbergasting, if you ask me. I can think of no other matter of which outside writing about a historical figure of antiquity is viewed as invalid because it happens to mention the person a hundred years later. \n \n Finally, there comes a point here where the non-historicity of Jesus becomes less likely than the historicity. If Jesus didn't exist, then the movement and stories of him were simply fabricated--there is no other possible explanation. Not just a few stories though--it would have to be an entire movement faked, from numerous letters claiming contact with him (Paul and other sources), other accounts written (e.g. Acts), to various teachers, leaders rising in the movement, to the founders and early members of the religion even going to imprisonment and their deaths for this hoax. So it makes more sense that there really was a person named Jesus and that, in SOME way, he had a profound effect on some people in the first century AD; and his movement spread.",

An important ancient source for the reign of King Herod is Josephus - but you've already ruled him out on the grounds it would be \"crass\" to cite him.\n \n 2). Tacitus, the celebrated Roman historian, was a hundred years too late, according to you, for his references to Christianity to be of any use, and his allusions are \"too vague\". \n \n 3). Suetonius also shows his acqaintance with a Jewish prophet he calls \"Chrestus\" - but perhaps he is unreliable in some way? \n \n 4). Pliny the Younger in his correspondence with Trajan asks for guidance on the oppression of Christians in Bithynia (circa 112) unless of course his letter is a forgery?\n \n 5). Tertullian (fl. 200) has information about the life and death of Jesus of Nazareth, but he also has been excluded on the grounds that he was a Christian and therefore biased.\n \n 6). Lucian the Greek satirist spoke derisively of Jesus in the second century - so I suppose his evidence would be admissible because it's hostile. \n \n The fact that by the time of Constantine there was already a large diaspora of Christian believers in the Mediterranean area, with a history of persecution, is I suppose \"irrelevant\" on the grounds that everyone had been taken in by a myth. Presumably, the extensive early Christian literature, including the very early First Letter to the Church of Corinth by Clement (circa 96), are likewise contributing to pure fantasy. \n \n Should you maintain your attitude of unmitigated scepticism to the point where even the very existence of Jesus Christ has to be \"proved\", which of course is impossible, despite the fact that although the New Testament contains historical errors, many of its particulars have turned out to be historically correct, this discussion has hit an impasse. (If we want to consider the life and work of an imaginary person, we might just as well talk about Sherlock Holmes - who you may remember, \"died at the Reichenbach Falls\", and was \"resurrected\" by his creator.) \n \n It's very curious that a person with a scientific view is so confident that he has ascertained a truth that apparently eludes so many scholars with respect to the historical authenticity of the New Testment. Even the objective understandings of science, let alone history, are, in principle, provisional. The current scientific framework of concepts, theories, procedures, and results (what Thomas Kuhn calls a paradigm) is flexible and could be adjusted to accommodate new data or perhaps even be radically restructured in the event of a \"scientific revolution\". I know this isn't likely, but it's conceivable. Doesn't this sort of reservation concerning beliefs within your own discipline make you cautious before generalising about religious matters? \n \n BTW: My Shakespeare aside was an illustration of how far (some) people will stretch any lacunae in historical evidence in order to promote a fanciful theory. So your analogy which compares the provenance of the First Folio with the New Testament is beside the point. \n \n James.",

An important ancient source for the reign of King Herod is Josephus - but you've already ruled him out on the grounds it would be \"crass\" to cite him.\n\n When did I dispute Josephus as a source supporting the reign of King Herod? It's on Jesus's divinity that the Testimonium Flavianum is called into question.\n \n2). Tacitus, the celebrated Roman historian, was a hundred years too late, according to you, for his references to Christianity to be of any use, and his allusions are \"too vague\".\n\n Tacitus refers to an otherwise unreferenced figure he calls 'Chrestus'. There is no referencing of Chrestus's identity, deeds, significance etc.\n \n3). Suetonius also shows his acqaintance with a Jewish prophet he calls \"Chrestus\" - but perhaps he is unreliable in some way?\n \n Same problem as Tacitus.\n \n4). Pliny the Younger in his correspondence with Trajan asks for guidance on the oppression of Christians in Bithynia (circa 112) unless of course his letter is a forgery?\n\n Don't be silly. Pliny's letter is evidence for the existence of Christians, not of the figure they worship. I could provide you today with firm evidence for the existence of Hindus: would that substantiate the existence of Shiva?\n \n5). Tertullian (fl. 200) has information about the life and death of Jesus of Nazareth, but he also has been excluded on the grounds that he was a Christian and therefore biased.\n\n Well, given that the thrust of my argument rested on the dearth of disinterested evidence, yes.\n \n6).

If you're going to accuse me of special pleading or selective use of evidence, please have the grace to cite the post where I committed the offence.\n \nThe fact that by the time of Constantine there was already a large diaspora of Christian believers in the Mediterranean area, with a history of persecution, is I suppose \"irrelevant\" on the grounds that everyone had been taken in by a myth. Presumably, the extensive early Christian literature, including the very early First Letter to the Church of Corinth by Clement (circa 96), are likewise contributing to pure fantasy.\n\n All of this is, once again, evidence for the existence of Christians, not for the reality of their godling. Nor is persecution a sign of legitimacy: communists were persecuted in 1950s America, but that doesn't make their claims any more valid.\n \nIt's very curious that a person with a scientific view is so confident that he has ascertained a truth that apparently eludes so many scholars with respect to the historical authenticity of the New Testment.\n\n For heaven's sake, how many times do I have to say I think it's more likely the NT Jesus was based on a real person that that he was entirely fictional?",

Intermediate positions can exist: it is quite possible, for example, that the author of the gospel ascribed to Luke sincerely believed that he had divined a greater truth in deciding that Joseph and Mary must have gone to Bethlehem for some official purpose, simply because the necessity for Jesus to have been born there transcended any other consideration.

(I don't think you take this extreme view).\n \n While this claim is not strictly true, it wouldn't matter if it were. There are many men and women in ancient times of whom we know very little indeed, but whose existence is not doubted on the grounds that no multiple evidences of their lives are documented. \n \n Of course, I would not agree that the account of Jesus' extraordinary life given in the gospels is no more credible than, say, the credulous accounts given in Herodotus of the deeds of heroes taken from legendary sources. \n \n I believe what Huckleberry was getting at is the tendency of sceptics to apply, a priori, standards of rigorous enquiry simply because a biblical source is under scrutiny.

It could arguably be presented as extraordinary.\n \n That being said, I would hardly call it proof. Certainly the miraculous requires faith. That can never be gotten around. However, claims of the non existence of jesus are ridiculous on their face and that minor errors of historical dates do not disqualify the scripture as perfect. Perfection is not about individual detail (at least this is how I understand the christian doctrine, of which I am somewhat skeptical) but it is rather about doctrinal reality.

But I see no reason to assume that someone believing someone lived would invalidate their view that they lived. Think about it. Most every biographer that's ever lived probably had admiration for whoever they were writing about. I just don't see why the fact Tertullian was a Christian automatically invalidates his claims. You have a bit better argument about him in that he was quite a while after Christ, so for that reason I don't normally point to Tertullian as evidence for the historical Jesus. \n \n Your statement that limits the issue of Tacitus as only refers to Jesus as Chrestus is woefully incomplete; in point of fact he refers to Jesus in his writing as \"the founder of the name\" (Christian), and having been been put to death by \"Pontius Pilate, procurator of Judea in the reign of Tiberius\". It is pretty clear that Tacitus was referring to the historical Jesus. The idea that this would be a later forgery by Christians isn't likely given that Tacitus doesn't speak highly of Christianity in the letter at all--the forgery of Jospehus has the author declaring Him the Christ; but Tacitus refers to the whole thing as a pernicious superstition. It seems unlikely that later Christian editing would have left or put in such blatant disbelief (and encouragement of disbelief) for anyone to read.\n \n You also didn't mention rabbi Akiba's account of \"Yeshua\" in 135 from non-Christian Jewish accounts (certainly what we would call 'dis-interested' parties)",

So there is good reason to believe that when Josephus was reporting on Jesus the brother of James, it was indeed Josephus writing.\n \n Even with the 1st account, in 1971 Sholomo Pines found an earlier version that was less corrupted, that still yet mentions Jesus (but doesn't declare him the 'Christ', which is consistent with what Origen said about Josephus).\n \n Regarding the Pliny and Trajan letters, it seems to me that a non-Biblical source pointing to people contemporary with Christ (who had lived only a few decades earlier) yet obviously operated under the understanding that he has indeed been around would suffice as at least adding weight to the idea that Jesus was indeed an historical person.\n \n Tertullian was indeed an \"interested\" party (a nice way of saying he was biased). But I see no reason to assume that someone believing someone lived would invalidate their view that they lived. Think about it. Most every biographer that's ever lived probably had admiration for whoever they were writing about. I just don't see why the fact Tertullian was a Christian automatically invalidates his claims. You have a bit better argument about him in that he was quite a while after Christ, so for that reason I don't normally point to Tertullian as evidence for the historical Jesus. \n \n Your statement that limits the issue of Tacitus as only refers to Jesus as Chrestus is woefully incomplete; in point of fact he refers to Jesus in his writing as \"the founder of the name\" (Christian), and having been been put to death by \"Pontius Pilate, procurator of Judea in the reign of Tiberius\". It is pretty clear that Tacitus was referring to the historical Jesus. The idea that this would be a later forgery by Christians isn't likely given that Tacitus doesn't speak highly of Christianity in the letter at all--the forgery of Jospehus has the author declaring Him the Christ; but Tacitus refers to the whole thing as a pernicious superstition. It seems unlikely that later Christian editing would have left or put in such blatant disbelief (and encouragement of disbelief) for anyone to read.\n \n You also didn't mention rabbi Akiba's account of \"Yeshua\" in 135 from non-Christian Jewish accounts (certainly what we would call 'dis-interested' parties)\n\n \n This is actually pretty good information. I would also add as argumentation that the idea that christians simply made this up at the time seems ludicrous. Those who were \"making it up\" or \"forging\" it were dying ridiculously horrible deaths in the face of persecution because of such forgeries. Those who wrote these things could have been tortured to death by law. It seems unlikely that they would have done so. Likewise the gospels and some of the early letters of paul and john are easily authentic (from a historical perspective) and those folks were the most persecuted. \n \n One must not only look at the evidence for \"forgeries\" and \"lies\" but must also ask the question \"why\". To say that it was to gain power makes no sense given the environment of the time they were written. It is just a nonsense argument.\n \n Huck",

   "And here, you've hit the nail on the head and gotten to the real root of the problem. \n \n The way that many atheists* have conveniently dealt with the 4 books we have that tell about the historical Jesus is to make an irrational blanket sweep of of the gospels out the window based solely on the fact they also contain religious content. It's a lot easier to assert something when you're essentially on a campaign to invalidate the use of the primary sources used by those being asserted against. This throwing of the baby out with the bathwater is like archaeologists and Egyptian historians refusing take anything of historical value from hieroglyphic inscriptions chronicling the leaders of Egypt solely on the basis that it also talks about Ra and declares the Pharoahs as living gods.\n \n And yes, it seems every time Jesus or Christianity is mentioned in early outside sources, there's an excuse that it can't be used. Convenient, isn't it? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \n \n * For the record, John Hanks has said he is not opposed to the idea of an historical Jesus (and efectively agreed that Jesus--\"an iternerant faith-healer\" from which Christianity emerged-- was probably a real person).

Regardless, there certainly IS a movement out there to completely invalidate the idea of any historicity of Jesus whatsoever.\n\n \n \n \n I, personally, don't care what kind of book or document it is. I don't care if its religious, I don't care who wrote it, etc. I only care if it can be backed up with solid evidence, regardless of its content. HOWEVER, there has been no solid evidence of an omnipotent zombie named \"Jesus\" who was executed by the ancient Roman government.

It seems your expectations are more stringent than those who put the Canon together. Let's simply be reasonable here; it's not like John refuted the synoptics or contradicts them regarding the birth story. There is a general consistency going on between these 4 books. That's not to say you aren't probably going to find details here and there than might not be identical. But I think you are expecting too much to demand they be identical in every way.\n \n And with all due respect, why are you using phrases like \"elaborately contrived a scenario\"?

To conveniently sweep those under the rug, you head that off at the pass by refusing to accept those accounts (Biblical ones) as evidence because it's Biblical.

You drew the immovable line in the sand right then and there. THAT'S why I usually don't bother trying to convince atheists about this sort of thing.\n \n \nNo, they aren't. That's simply untrue. You've admitted as much in previous posts. emoticon_confused\n\n \n They aren't documented as much as anything else in the Bible? Have you read the Bible??? There are miracles here and there throughout!\n \n \nYou're proposing the same argument as Huckleberry, ie that since some of the NT can be proven to be reasonably historically accurate, that it must all be accurate. That's illogical.\n\n \n No, I didn't make that argument. I believe it's all true, but I didn't use the fact that some is true as proof that it ALL is true. And I'm really not so sure Huckleberry did either.\n \n \nAt the end of the day, I'm left with a mountain of evidence and the world that exists around me to suggest that the claims of the NT are simlpy false. \n \n \n That's your interpretation of the world around you, which is different than mine (and many others). I've seen miracles take place with my own eyes, and so my view is NOT just based on faith, but on observation.",

   "But there aren't significant amounts of people throughout history that claim to have made 2+2 correctly work out to be 12, and there aren't documented cases where it indeed was. Your example just doesn't fit.\n\n \n What are you talking about? Who in history claimed 2+2=12? Besides, who cares if someone claimed that, it's clearly not true, no matter how much they argue it.\n \n The whole point was to show how absurd the comment that anything can be argued truly was.\n \n \nProof depends on what a person requires as proof. You've chosen the position that you will not take accounts of miracles as evidence, even though with other issues and events that don't have that \"divine\" stigma attached, you probably WOULD take accounts as evidence, or at least as adding weight.\n\n \n Yes and no. Proof, ie 100% certainty, is in no way subjective. 2+2=4 is not dependent on what I require as evidence in order to believe in it for it to be true. However, most things are not so cut and dried.\n \n You're making assumptions Jyoshu, and you know where that leaves you.\n \n Divine, supernatural, whatever....., personal accounts have value, the question is, how much value?\n \n If you claim a miracle, and I can provide a perfectly reasonable explanation, then it isn't a miracle. \n \n If you claim a miracle, and I can't provide an explanation, then it is just that, unexplained. It's not the work of God or a unicorn, it's simply unexplained. \n \n You can choose to attribute it to God, I can choose the unicorn, neither of us can prove we're right, so therefore, even if miracles are accepted as being completely real and viable evidence, neither one of us is any further ahead. The supernatural, regardless of whether you believe in it or not, makes really terrible evidence.\n \n \nSo you're claiming they're in-explainable? But they certainly ARE explainable within the understanding that there is a God. You're assigning a category to miracles ('in-explainability') that only fits within someone's thinking who goes against the grain that there is such a thing as the divine. All the while people down through history claim to have observed miracles and believed in them based on observation. To conveniently sweep those under the rug, you head that off at the pass by refusing to accept those accounts (Biblical ones) as evidence because it's Biblical. You refuse to accept the evidence of miracles, BECAUSE it pertains to miracles! Therefore your reasoning is circular.\n\n \n We're getting back to tired waters of defining words again, hopefully my dictionary skills have improved. I'm not assigning any category, I'm using the word as its defined, I know you're not fond of that. Miracles are defined as being unexplainable according to our understanding of the physical world around us - we therefore assign them to the supernatural, that can be God, that can be Thor, that can unicorns. Whatever your poison, it doesn't make them explainable, it merely let's you attribute them to whatever source you've chosen, no evidence required, only faith. \n \n Most \"miracles\" in history have been shown to have been due to simple natural phenomenon that were not understood.\n \n You're accusing me of circular logic when you're arguing for accepting biblical accounts of miracles because they're recorded in the Bible? emoticon_confused \n \n What exactly is the evidence of miracles? I'll save you the time - it boils down to individual, personal accounts. I don't dismiss this evidence out of hand. Just because it can't currently be explained doesn't mean that some day it won't be, by the same token, maybe it will never be explained. Either way, it's up to the individual to weigh this evidence and the person presenting it, and determine its value compared to the other available evidence. That's not circular reasoning, that's reasoning based on logic and evidence. In basic terms, I give accounts of miracles a 1 on the reliability scale, where I would give physical evidence 100, that is my choice. Further, as stated above, regardless of reliabilty, miracles have little value as evidence, regardless of one's choice in accepting them or not.\n \n \nBut see? Did you catch that? You've already assumed they had non-supernatural explanations completely ahead of time. That's exactly what I'm talking about. You drew the immovable line in the sand right then and there. THAT'S why I usually don't bother trying to convince atheists about this sort of thing.\n\n \n Of course I did. I've spent the last two posts explaining that I prefer to base my decisions on the natural and logical rather than faith and the supernatural. That doesn't mean I drew an immoveable line, that simply means I started with a defacto position, a dashed pencil line if you will, that is open to change should evidence present itself that such a change is required. \n \n That's also why I don't bother getting into discussions that involve faith, no amount of logic, reason, or evidence will have any affect on those that choose faith.\n \n \nThey aren't documented as much as anything else in the Bible? Have you read the Bible??? There are miracles here and there throughout!\n\n \n I've read the Bible, I was raised Catholic.\n \n You're using the Bible as proof of the Bible again. \n \n The miracles are not documented by outside sources, as is the case with the veracity of a historical Jesus, that's the point. Quite simply, there is no evidence, at least that I'm aware of, for the miracles recorded in the Bible outside of the Bible itself.\n \n \nNo, I didn't make that argument. I believe it's all true, but I didn't use the fact that some is true as proof that it ALL is true. And I'm really not so sure Huckleberry did either.\n\n \n You effectively just did by stating that miracles are recorded in the Bible as often as anything that can be correlated in history, and therefore are well documented. I'd beg to differ.\n \n My apologies if you didn't intend to imply what you were so blatantly implying, but either you're relying on circular logic, or you're making an appeal to the documented historically accurate portions of the NT as evidence for the veracity of the remainder of the Bible, and therefore the position that the miracles recorded in the NT constitute evidence and I quote \"as (well) documented as anything else in the gospels..\"\n \n It's really quite simply one or the other. \n \n \nThat's your interpretation of the world around you, which is different than mine (and many others). I've seen miracles take place with my own eyes, and so my view is NOT just based on faith, but on observation.\n\n \n I'm sure you believe they were miracles, they may or may not have been, I can't judge that from here.\n \n What you've observed is something you can't explain, as stated above, it's only through your belief, and faith, that you attribute it to God.\n \n Waxy",

No contemporary, even those hostile to the movement, denies their veracity. Denials of veracity only come many hundreds of years laters.

Is that significant evidence that there is a God, and that he sometimes makes it snow?\n \n Furthermore, why is the doctor's lack of an explanation evidence of the supernatural, let alone God? It could simply be something natural at work in the body that we don't as yet understand. \n \n It's far from \"significant\" evidence, in fact, it's about as far as it gets. It takes faith on your part to attribute it to God. It's not completely without value, as it is a possible explanation, it just isn't a very likely one.\n \n \nI'm sorry, but I'm not going to just go along with automatically saying the Bible accounts are not usable as evidence.

But I was in fact thinking of John 7, where he in effect does contradict the birth story:\n \n40 Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.\n 41 Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?\n 42 Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?\n 43 So there was a division among the people because of him.\n\n John seems to have believed Jesus wasn't born in Bethlehem.\n \n...That's not to say you aren't probably going to find details here and there than might not be identical. But I think you are expecting too much to demand they be identical in every way.\n\n I won't accuse you of a straw man, because I don't believe that was your intent; but nor did I ever suggest credible gospels should be identical in every way. Where we differ, I suspect, is that some of what you are prepared to call 'details' I would regard as deep contradictions. A ten-year difference in the birth date is more than a 'detail' I think.\n \nAnd with all due respect, why are you using phrases like \"elaborately contrived a scenario\"? That sounds like the hoax theory thing.\n\n I think we're on well-trodden ground here, though I don't mind giving it another perambulation. Matthew and others seem to have misinterpreted Micah 5:2, which refers to a man called Bethlehem Ephratah and not to a place. Micah goes on to ascribe lots of deeds to the one who will 'come forth' (such as expelling the Assyrians) that bear no relation to Jesus at all. Nonetheless, Matt & Luke went ahead and - yes - contrived a scenario that would tick off this faux-prophecy as fulfilled. 'Hoax' isn't the right word: pious wish-fulfillment might be closer.\n \nDo you have reason to believe Jesus was in fact NOT born in Bethlehem?\n\n The evidence that he was is weak. He was known as Jesus of Nazareth, John refers to him coming from Galilee, Matt & Luke's dates clash, and the earliest writers (Paul and Mark) don't mention the place. This is all very consistent with the story being a later accretion.",

John 7:40 and so forth only communicate that some people were claiming that he was not from bethlehem. John nowhere says that he believes this to be accurate. JOhn is communicating that there was a division among the people some claiming jesus to be a prophet, some claiming him to be the christ, some claiming that he could not be since he was from galilee. Since JOhn is communicating contradictory claims that means some were wrong and some were right. You statement that John believed him to not be born in bethlehem is taking this item completely out of context. \n \n Johnhanks, I have seen much better argumentation from you. Please review this section and note what it is that John is actually communicating. He is clearly not saying that jesus was not born in bethlehem.

To say that Paul was trying to advance his own purpose and power is ridiculous. He was a pharisee. They were part of the ruling class of the jews. He was on the top as a pharisee. To convert to christianity means that he chose to go to the bottom. It would be silly of him to go this route. Especially one where he knew he could be killed for it. At the time, such christians (especially after the crucifixion) were illegal and to be killed. Paul was eventually beheaded for his belief. He accepted imprisonment happily. I would hardly call that efforts to get ahead. Your argument is without merit.\n\n \n As I stated, I have no interest, or ability, to discuss Paul in detail.\n \n People act irrationally based on their beliefs everyday. Those actions do not prove the validity of their beliefs.\n \n \nThere are lots that claim the crucifixion, all of pauls letters for instance, Josephus, pliny the younger, cestus, and many others.

If they had really wanted to gain the foothold (if it did not happen) they could have easily trotted out that the claims were utterly ludicrous. Not one enemy of christians EVER claims it did not happen until many centuries later. Surely, if they wanted to discredit this religion (and they most certainly did) much the same way the ceasers did not want it spreading they could have said quite easily that what was claimed never actually happened. That does not show up anywhere by anyone. Instead, they act as if it did occur and then outlaw it or interpret differently or attack those that spread the news.\n\n \n Crucifixion was a common pratice at the time, certainly nothing extraordinary, why on earth would they claim it never happened? All types of criminals and enemies of the state were crucified, Jesus was just one of many.

I don't think I could have been much clearer.\n\n \n What you said was indeed clear, but it was simply lacking. After evaluating everything you said it is still clear of the line you've drawn.\n \n \nNot only did I not suggest that the supernatural is evidence for miracles (which makes absolutely no sense emoticon_confused ), but you missed the point entirely. \n\n \n Here is what you said, at the end ... \"The supernatural, regardless of whether you believe in it or not, makes really terrible evidence.\"\n \n ....\"The supernatural makes really terrible evidence.\" \n \n Terrible evidence for WHAT? I assumed you meant for miracles. But I guess I was mistaken.\n \n But look, we're now down to quibbling back and forth on individual sentences, and I'm not interested in that sort of discussion. I'll concede those just for the sake of avoiding the discussion falling into quagmire.\n \n \nEven if you and I accept miracles as evidence/proof of the supernatural, there is no evidence/proof that would allow you to attribute them to a particular supernatural or divine entity\n\n \n Agreed, but then I'm not arguing any point as to narrowing it down to a particular God here. Your point would be useless to a, say, universalist.\n \n \nOccam's Razor. If a simple natural explanation is available, it's the superior explanation.\n\n \n But now you're starting with the premise that the idea that it's God is not natural! You keep bringing up new premise after premise to keep your point alive. Again, we're back to you rejecting God initially, and operating from THAT instead of starting from an open slate. You're already bringing prejudices to the table. (not \"prejudices\" in the sense of bigotry, but in the sense of pre-judiced.\"\n \n \nYou present this example, likely because it's most simple in nature, but how many examples of this are truly out there? Where doctors had absolutely no explanation for a cure?\n\n \n LOL. Sorry, but it happens all the time; something that many Christians deal with in prayers. I know a guy personally who was healed of an incurable disease.\n \n \nIf I pray to God for snow, and it snows tomorrow, is that a miracle? \n\n \n No because that's not out of the ordinary. But if it snowed with a clear sky in 95 degree F temperatures, then THAT might indeed be a miracle.\n \n \nFurthermore, why is the doctor's lack of an explanation evidence of the supernatural, let alone God? It could simply be something natural at work in the body that we don't as yet understand. \n \n \n It could be, but at that point you're speculating about as much as you would be about claiming it to be a miracle anyway.\n \n \nIt's far from \"significant\" evidence, in fact, it's about as far as it gets. It takes faith on your part to attribute it to God. It's not completely without value, as it is a possible explanation, it just isn't a very likely one.\n\n \n Yes it does take faith, but I can never agree with you that observation and experience don't play a role in coming to these conclusions. They are BOTH explanations, and they are both NATURAL explanations (your occam's razor comment). Now you're going to always say I mis-observed it or mis-interpreted it, but that's your opinion based on the fact that you are simply always going to say that, because you've drawn your line in the sand.\n \n \nJyoshu, it has nothing to with prejudice or a stigma, that's an absurd claim and strictly emotional defensiveness on your part. It's simple reality and logic. Whether or not you choose to go along with it is quite frankly irrelevant.\n\n \n Again, I'm not talking about prejudiced in the sense of bigotry. But regardless if you think the line is drawn there due to logic and reality, it's rather all about your decision to draw the line there and bring the intention of refusing to believe in these things even though people claim to have experienced them. You simply refuse to allow for the idea that what others say about their religious experiences could indeed BE reality!\n \n \nSimple analogies are endless, but whether you choose Johnny Cash's autobiography or the Harry Potter books, if the only evidence and support for the claims in the books is the books themselves, that doesn't in any way constitute sufficient evidence to suggest, let alone prove, their veracity.\n\n \n Wow. Just wow! I don't know what to say. In all my life until now I've never run into anyone that would say an autobiography of a historical figure cannot suffice as sufficient evidence of assuming something happened if there's no other evidence out there as well. (Which IS what you just said.) For goodness' sake, if the person THEMSELVES writes about something that they did or thought, or experienced, you still won't take it as sufficient evidence that it's what they did, thought, or experienced??? Do you require everything someone writes about their own life to be backed up by witnesses? Why do you even bother reading most autobiographies? (Maybe you don't.) Regardless, I'm quickly realizing that your standards for what would suffice as evidence are simply unrealistic, and it goes a long ways toward explaining your position on all this.\n \n \nProof is rarely subjective, and certainly doesn't rely on concensus.\n\n \n And you were saying that *I* didn't read what you wrote? \n \n I never said it relies on consensus.

Apparently you believe the book in its entirety to be completely factual, because Hitler wrote it HIMSELF about \"something that they (he) did or thought, or experienced\". \n \n An autobiography (or a biography) is the/a person's account of what happened, it's not infallible, and IMHO, should not be accepted carte blanche as truth. (Have you watched the Biography Channel or Walk the Line, or for the Canadians out there the recent CBC documentary \"The Tommy Douglas Story\"? Accepting those biographies as entirely factual or complete is rather naive.) Given Johnny Cash's reputation, I'd be inclined to accept what he says as fact, but that doesn't mean he couldn't be lying or exaggerating the truth, even if it were unintentional. We can only take him at his word unless actual evidence can be provided or the stories can be corroborated by others. I'm admittedly a skeptic, but to me that's simple common sense.\n \n If Johnny Cash had written that he once drank 5 gallons of whisky and swallowed 4000 pills in one night, that would be a pretty fantastic claim. Would you automatically accept it as true? I myself would be pretty darn skeptical. Now, if he had a medical report from the ensuing trip to the hospital that claimed they pumped his stomach and came up with 4 gallons of whisky and 3500 pills that would be excellent evidence. Alternative, though not as good, evidence for the veracity of his claims would be verification by one or more other people that witnessed it. Either way, I'd be far more inclined to accept it as truth.\n \n I've read many biographies and autobiograpies, including both of Johnny Cash's. I've really enjoyed them for the most part, and I've found very little in any of them that made me skeptical, but there are some claims I find a little fantastical.\n \n \nAnd you were saying that *I* didn't read what you wrote? \n \n I never said it relies on consensus. I said consensus becomes important because if more and more experts evaluate something then it becomes clearer what suffices (for THAT situation) whether something suffices as proof or not.\n\n \n To some extent I agree, especially if additional evidence and testing of the data/evidence have been done that support the claim.\n \n However, it remains a logical fallacy - ad populum - no matter how you cut it.

In the case of miracles in the Bible, there is no outside disproving evidence. You said you wouldn't take an autobigraphical account as sufficient evidence for an event even if no other evidence was out there to disprove it. (\"if the only evidence and support for the claims in the books is the books themselves, that doesn't in any way constitute sufficient evidence\"). At the end of the day, if someone in an autobiography claims they saw an angel, you are discounting that because you don't believe in angels, not because evidence suggests they are lying. The only evidence you can really point to is that you know you've never seen an angel. So you're really using lack-of-evidence to you personally AS evidence against a claim, which is really poor reasoning. \n \n There comes a point in your mind where someone you read crosses from the ordinary and believable to the fantastic and unbelievable. And that line is defined by your experiences and intentions. It does not necessarily exist in reality, but rather in your thinking. People have that line in different places. That's why I said proof depends on the person being proven to. I don't mean to be too philosophical here, but I think it matters.

   "Perhaps we are thinking of 'natural' in different senses. I didn't mean natural in the sense of being \"physical\" (as opposed to spiritual), and I didn't realize that you meant that either. I meant natural in the sense of being present in nature (as defined by the American Heritage Dictionary).\n\n \n I think we could argue this point too, but probably better we don't, as it's essentially just another branch of what we're already discussing \n \n \nBut we know those are lies because of other evidence. In the case of miracles in the Bible, there is no outside disproving evidence. You said you wouldn't take an autobigraphical account as sufficient evidence for an event even if no other evidence was out there to disprove it. (\"if the only evidence and support for the claims in the books is the books themselves, that doesn't in any way constitute sufficient evidence\"). At the end of the day, if someone in an autobiography claims they saw an angel, you are discounting that because you don't believe in angels, not because evidence suggests they are lying. The only evidence you can really point to is that you know you've never seen an angel. So you're really using lack-of-evidence to you personally AS evidence against a claim, which is really poor reasoning. \n\n \n Exactly, and that's why we seek out other evidence as verification.\n \n The part I've bolded is a logical fallacy. Lack of evidence denying an event is not proof of the event. (This will bite me a bit later LOL)\n \n Couple of clarifications -\n \n I stated I wouldn't accept it as being definitive without evidence to either prove it or disprove it. \n \n \n(\"if the only evidence and support for the claims in the books is the books themselves, that doesn't in any way constitute sufficient evidence\"). \n\n \n The statement is correct, and I stand by it, I bolded the key word for emphasis. While it does provide evidence, it's not sufficient evidence to prove the claims.\n \n As to the angels - If someone claims to see an angel, it's not my personal bias that prevents me from automatically accepting it as true, it's the fact that to the best of my knowledge, there are no known verified cases of the existence of angels in the world. I base my interpretation, and skepticism of the claim, on the available evidence, not on a personal bias or belief. I know to you that's likely splitting hairs, but I think it's an important distinction.\n \n HOWEVER, as stated, the lack of evidence for the existence of angels is not proof that they don't exist, so the possibility remains that the author's claim of seeing angels may be true, just highly unlikely.\n \n \nThere comes a point in your mind where someone you read crosses from the ordinary and believable to the fantastic and unbelievable. And that line is defined by your experiences and intentions. It does not necessarily exist in reality, but rather in your thinking. People have that line in different places. That's why I said proof depends on the person being proven to. I don't mean to be too philosophical here, but I think it matters. It is important to point out that a given person's line doesn't necessarily correspond with where the line would lie in reality, if there even is a line in reality. I think the biggest difference between a religious person and a skeptic is where that line lies. For you, the evidence suggests the line lies in one place; for the religious person the evidence (NOT just faith) suggests it lies in another.\n\n \n I see your point that \"proof\" is dependent on the person in terms of what they require to be convinced. Humour this very simple analogy -\n \n I tell a child that Santa exists. That's all the evidence the child needs to believe in Santa. Have I proven that Santa exists?\n \n I think you're (we're?) confusing the term proof with acceptance. Proving the veracity of an assertion to a third party and convincing a third party of an assertions veracity are not the same thing.\n \n I agree with you that people place the line in different places. What people choose to accept as proof varies from children's total belief in Santa Claus, to adults believing in Star Trek, to the religious, to the spiritual, to the die hard materialist atheist. I can't say who's right for sure, but I do have an opinion as to which position is the most logically supportable.\n \n My point in all this is that a line can be drawn, the \"reality line\" if you will, that separates the physical, proveable, testable world from that which is for lack of a better word the \"supernatural\". That line is as close to immoveable as can be IMHO, and separates what can be proven from what can only be interpreted from the evidence, or accepted on faith. \n \n \nThey why should we allow autobiographies as sources for term papers, theses, articles, and the like, any more than the Bible? You see, you are using this as an example to analogize the Bible, essentially. I know you don't mean it as analogous in every way, but people do generally give a lot of weight to autobiographies (particularly in the absence of outside disproving evidence)--certainly more weight than you seem to give the Bible. We are, after all, talking about accounts of miracles, and many of those come from the Bible.\n\n \n Firstly, because most autobiographies (biographies in the case of the Bible) don't claim divinity of the subject or contain numerous supernatural claims, and are therefore not open to the same scrutiny.\n \n Biographies are tested for veracity, the authors are free to make whatever outrageous claims they choose, but they also have to realize that those claims will be scrutinized. \n \n Using a single autobiography for a paper/report might be acceptable practice in grade school, but in high school or university, submitting a report or thesis on an individual based solely on their autobiography would be a sure way to land yourself a 'F'. Verification from multiple outside sources is required for academic research and thesis preparation.\n \n In the same way, to use your analogy, using only the Bible as proof of the Bible is not acceptable if the goal is logical or academic credibility.\n \n \nAt any rate, I've enjoyed this exchange; it's been interesting. Thanks.\n\n \n Ive enjoyed it as well. I suppose we can end here. emoticon_xhoho \n \n Waxy",

His rule, whether or not officially titled governor, would have been considered by those under it to be governor like and they would have ascribed that title to him whether or not it was official.

To quote from the above link:\n \n...Quirinius is known to have fought a war in Asia Minor between 6 B.C. and 1 B.C. ... First, it makes no sense to date an event in Judaea by referring to a special command in a war in Asia. Why not simply name the actual legate in Syria? There is no reason to pass over the most obvious man and name another who has absolutely nothing to do with Judaea, much less a census there.\n Second, just because Quirinius was probably assigned a Syrian legion to fight bandits on the mountain border between Galatia and Cilicia, it does not follow that he had any kind of command in Syria. To the contrary, he was in the province of Galatia, not Syria, and by special command of Augustus. It only makes sense that he was appointed legate of Galatia for this war, for otherwise the actual legate of Galatia would have been fighting it. A Syrian legate would have no business fighting a war in someone else's province, especially in a territory that would leave him cut off from his own province by a large mountain range: for the Homanadenses were active in the mountain-lake valley in Galatia, boxed in by the mountains of Pisidia, Lycaonia, and Isauria--the valley surrounding Egridir lake, Turkey, on a modern map. Every expert familiar with the facts agrees that \"only an army coming from the north could subjugate mountain tribes\" in that region, in other words an army led from the province of Galatia, not Syria. So it would be quite nonsensical of Luke to refer to Quirinius' command and probable governorship in the province of Galatia as \"holding a command in Syria,\" all the more so since \"being a ruler of Syria\" is what the phrase actually means anyway (since \"Syria\" appears in the genitive, not dative case).\n",

Matthew actually says Herod\n \nslew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof\n \n\n Matthew the obsessive ticker-off of prophecies also underlines in 2:18 how big a deal it would have been by saying it fulfilled this prophecy:\n \nIn Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning\n\n Demographic studies of contemporary population structure indicate that some 10% of the local population would have been killed.

Thorley argued that Luke's wording only means that Augustus decreed that the registration practices that had been employed in Italy for centuries and in the provinces for some time should be extended throughout the Roman world, including client kingdoms.[54] Sherwin-White, who does not support the speculation that Quirinius conducted a census before A.D. 6, suggests that Luke intends to refer only to a policy of universal registration promulgated by Augustus, and that this was first implemented in Judaea under Quirinius.[55]\n \n Luke's statement that Joseph and Mary had to travel to Bethlehem 'because he was descended from the house and family of David' has also been called into question; J. Dunn wrote: \"the idea of a census requiring individuals to move to the native town of long dead ancestors is hard to credit\".[56] However K. F. Doig observed that for some forms of taxation and enrolment would be conducted where the tribal records were kept.[57] There is evidence that the Roman Empire did retain certain local tax enrolment customs for non-citizens at times, for example in Egypt.[58] Additionally, taxes had to be paid in the principal towns of taxation districts.[59] Lastly, it is known that some censuses did require subjects to return to their administrative districts.[60]\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Census_of_Quirinius_and_the_Gospels\n \n\n \n and also:\n \n \nProblems and solutions\n The Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of Matthew both place Jesus' birth under the reign of Herod the Great. Luke also describes the birth as occurring during the \"first census\", during the \"governing\" (&#7969;&#947;&#949;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;; root: &#7969;&#947;&#949;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#969;) of Quirinius, and implies that it took place during the reign of \"King Herod\". However, Josephus states that Quirinius was sent to govern Syria, and instructed to carry out a census of Judea, in AD 6, long after the death of Herod the Great (4 B.C.).\n \n Many scholars contend that the sources present contradictory material and explain the disparity as an error on Luke's part, holding that he misidentified the date of Quirinius's census with the reign of Herod the Great. Others, however, have attempted to reconcile the accounts. One proposed reconciliation accepts that Luke places a census taken by Quirinius during the reign of Herod the Great, but argues that Quirinius may have been the Roman authority in the region twice, with an earlier tenure during Herod's kingship. Another accepts that a census was taken during Herod's rule, but offers a different translation whereby Luke is not understood as presenting Quirinius as Herod's contemporary. A final proposal contends that Luke should not be read as placing Jesus' birth under Herod's reign. Lastly, some scholars have simply stated that the problem is at present irresolvable; in the words of H. Hendrickx: \"The available evidence is insufficient to form any firm solution.\"[10]\n \n \n [edit] Luke in error\n Many scholars contend that the Luke misidentified the date of Quirinius's census with the reign of Herod the Great. James Dunn remarks: \"It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Luke was mistaken\".[11] W. D. Davies and E. P. Sanders remark: \"on many points, especially about Jesus' early life, the evangelists were ignorant ... they simply did not know, and, guided by rumour, hope or supposition, did the best they could\".[12] In A Companion to the New Testament, Anthony Harvey agrees: \"we should perhaps be prepared to admit that (in an epoch when such things were much more difficult to get right than they are now) he fell into error about some of the details.\"[13] J. P. Meier considers \"attempts to reconcile Luke 2:1 with the facts of ancient history... hopelessly contrived\",[14] to which R. E. Brown concurs.[15] Roman historian A. N. Sherwin-White, though he vindicates much of Luke's account, concludes that \"[t]he attempt to defend Luke\" by postulating a census of Quirinius before A.D. 6 \"was misconceived\", and that in Luke, in bringing together John's nativity under Herod and Jesus' under Quirinius, \"accepted [an] incompatible synchronism\".[16] Fergus Millar says \"Only Matthew and Luke take the story back to the birth of Jesus, and do so in wholly different and incompatible ways. . . Both birth narratives are constructs, one historically plausible [i.e. Matthew], the other wholly impossible [i.e. Luke], and both are designed to reach back to the infancy of Jesus, and to assert his connection to the house of David . . . and his birth in Bethlehem.\"[17]\n \n Some have suggested that Luke's motive may have been to provide an account that would fit the expectation that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem: \"The journey for census and tax registration is sacred fiction, a creation of Luke's imagination in order to get Jesus' parents to Bethlehem for his birth.\"[18] In a biography of Herod, Peter Richardson suggests: \"Luke backdated the census of Quirinius and then used it as the reason for Joseph and Mary's trip to Bethlehem\".[19]\n \n \n [edit] Reconciling the sources\n \n [edit] Quirinius governing twice\n To reconcile Luke and Josephus, some have speculated that Quirinius was governor of Syria twice, or at least \"governing\" (h\u00eagemoneuontos, a term that, besides describing a governor, could refer to other promagistri or quaestores)[20] in the area at an earlier date, and that he conducted two censuses-one in 4 B.C., referenced by Luke; and the other around A.D. 6, referenced by Josephus.\n \n Sentius Saturninus was provincial governor in Syria from 9 to 6 B.C., followed by Publius Quinctilius Varus, who according to Josephus led a force against a revolt in Judea after Herod's death, which would mean he was an authority in Judea until at least April of 4 B.C. After Varus it is not known who was governing Syria from 4 to 1 B.C. If Quirinius did serve as governor of the province twice, it would have to have been during this time, which would be after the accepted date of death for Herod. Hence, it becomes necessary to either posit a co-governorship, or at least some form of co-rule, for Quirinius, unless one posits an alternate date for Herod's death or an unrecorded vacancy in the provincial governorship.\n \n Theodore Mommsen was the first to argue that a damaged inscription known as the Lapis Tiburtinus[21] might provide evidence of an earlier governorship of Quirinius, which Mommsen placed after that of Varus, around 3 B.C.[22] This position was attacked by Groag in 1931, who argued that the stone does not necessarily mention two governorships of Syria (as Mommsen had argued), but simply two \"legateships,\" not necessarily in the same province.[23] Ronald Syme, following Groag's reasoning, argued that \"whether or not the man [referenced by the Tiburtine inscription] was Quirinius-and it could still perhaps be maintained that he was-there is no reason for believing that he was twice governor of Syria.\"[24] Syme thought L. Calpurnius Piso was the more likely candidate for the inscription, while Groag argued that it referenced M. Plautius Silvanus.[25]\n \n The hypothesis that Quirinius was twice governor of Syria, supported by the evidence of Luke and the Tiburtine inscription, was the standard scholarly position until Syme advanced his arguments in 1934. It was thought that Quirinius conducted the Homonadensian war from Syria, and that this war took place between 3 and 2 B.C.[26] Yet Syme argued that the Homonadensian campaign may be better dated to 6 B.C., and that Quirinius conducted it as governor of Galatia, rather than as governor of Syria.[27] Today, most scholars follow Syme and hold that Quirinius was governor in Galatia from before 6 B.C. until just before A.D. 2, and that this precludes the possibility that he was governor in Syria during this period.[28] They hold this position, in part, for reasons of historical precedent. As J.G.C. Anderson observed, \"A second tenure of Syria or indeed any other consular province under one and the same emperor by a senator who was not a member of the imperial house [i.e., Quirinius] is unparalleled.\"[29]\n \n \n [edit] Alternative Translation of Luke\n In 1938, F.M. Heichelheim proposed an alternate translation of Luke 2:2, suggesting that it might be rendered: This census was the first before the census taken when Quirinius was governor.[30] This translation relies on the fact that the Greek word protos, usually translated first, also means \"before\" or \"former\" when it is followed by the genitive case. Under this translation, Luke is not placing Jesus' birth during a governorship of Quirinius; rather, he is referring to a census that occurred before Quirinius's undisputed governorship in A.D. 6 (and thus before the census associated with Quirinius which sparked the uprising of Judas the Galilean), and likewise during the reign of King Herod.[31] This position has been followed by several other scholars.[32] If accepted, this translation would resolve the difficulty of locating Quirinius amongst the governors of Herod's day, though of course it does not address the plausibility of a census under Herod.\n \n Heichelheim's proposed translation was rejected by Horst Braunert, who interpreted Acts 5:37, which speaks of \"the census\", to exclude the possibility that Luke 2:2 mentions a different census. Braunert also noted that ancient sources, namely the Suda and John Chrysostom, while paraphrasing the passage of Luke in question, speak unambiguously of \"the first census.\" In other words, the standard translation of Luke 2:2 reflects an ancient understanding of the text.[33] A. N. Sherwin-White has also considered the alternative translation implausible, and argued that it could not be accepted without a parallel usage elsewhere in Luke's writings.[34] However, B. W. R. Pearson observed the difficulty in establishing a \"regular\" usage of any particular writer given so small a sample, and argued that, in the greater context of the Hellenistic Greek in which Luke wrote, such usage \"is well attested, and we do not even have to go outside the New Testament itself to find it (cp. John 5:36 and 1Corinthians 1:25).\"[35]\n \n \n [edit] Census under Herod\n Augustus had an interest in the collection of census data on his empire. He is known to have taken a census of Roman citizens at least three times, in 28 B.C., 8 B.C., and A.D. 14.[36] Orosius mentioned another census in 3 B.C.[37] There is also evidence that censuses were taken at regular intervals during his reign, at least in the provinces of Egypt and Sicily, important because of their wealthy estates and supply of grain.[38]\n \n There is also the census in Judea mentioned by Josephus in A.D. 6 (see above), which occurred after Judaea was annexed to the province of Syria. According to Josephus, the taxation associated with this census prompted a revolt. Sch\u00fcrer argued that an earlier enrolment would have evoked the same response, and that this would have been noted by Josephus.[39] An earlier enrollment, if ordered and administered by an imperial official, would also be unprecedented. Client kingdoms paid tribute to Rome, and often taxed their own subjects for the paying of this tribute, but their residents were not directly taxed by the empire.\n \n Archelaos, King of the Clitae in Cilicia Tracheia, is known to have attempted a Roman-style census in service of his own taxation; L.R. Taylor supposes that Herod may have acted similarly.[40] Palestine had been subject to many Roman military campaigns and tribute payment, beginning with Pompey in 48 B.C.,[41] and Herod, who had been established as king by Marc Anthony and the Roman Senate,[42] was (like other client kings) often beholden to Anthony and Augustus, and has been called a \"model of what those dependent rulers ought to be.\"[43] Herod was likewise required to pay tribute to Rome,[44] and he raised the money for this tribute through taxation of his subjects.[45] While it is not credible to accept that a Roman styled census conducted by Roman officials occurred in Herod's kingdom, according to Ramsay: \"Luke does not speak of any such application,\" in that he does not claim the census was conducted by a Roman official.[46] B. W. R. Pearson speculated that Herod very possibly employed Roman administrative techniques in taxing his own people and that Luke is referring to this.[47]\n \n \n [edit] Jesus born in A.D. 6\n Some authors propose that Luke intended to date Jesus' birth to A.D. 6. According to this interpretation, Luke 2:2 and Josephus refer to the same census, which occurred during the first governorship of Quirinius, in A.D. 6. This interpretation brings Luke into conflict with Matthew, wherein it is clear that Jesus was born some time before the death of Herod the Great (see above). J. Duncan M. Derrett argued that the Herod referred to in Luke 1:36 may well be Herod Archelaus, and not Herod the Great; he characterized the debate surrounding Luke and the census as having suffered from a \"pre-critical\" tendency to harmonize the Gospels, and held that Luke has his own internal chronology, differing from Matthew's.[48] Mark Smith has recently advanced a similar argument, contending that Matthew placed the death of Jesus too early and that Luke is a more reliable source in this regard.[49] However, one difficulty with this solution is Luke's statement that Jesus was \"about thirty years of age\" when his ministry began (Luke 3:23). Luke places the baptism of Jesus (and hence his ministry) after John the Baptist began his preaching, which Luke dates to \"the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar\" (Luke 3:1), i.e. c. A.D. 27 - hence from this it appears Luke is placing Jesus' birth around 3 B. C. (in accord with Matthew).[50]\n \n (same source)\n \n\n \n \n Please note, AGAIN, not that any of this is proof, merely that there are competing theories and plenty of evidence to make it such that:\n \n WE DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER!\n \n Thanks\n \n Huck",

   "Well, I know it's been a while since this has been posted on, but I still have unanswered questions (remembered this when I was searching for the word \"Sodom\" for some of my past posts).\n \n \nFinding ruins of Sodom, early evidence of king David, and of 7th century BC Hebrew writing (not just oral tradition) to name a few. There are several other Biblical cities that were assumed to be myths that have been found, such as Jericho. The whole Hittite civilization was thought to be a myth at one time.\n\n \n \nCould you give some links for that? I'm rather interested. I've never heard of the Sodom one, or the Jericho one. I already knew about the evidence for king David, but none of the others in your post.\n\n \n \nMost of this I've read about in journals and books, but I'll see what I can find online for you.\n\n \n \nThanks, that'd be great. If you can remember any of the journal articles (or can easily look them up), please give those. \n\n \n It's been about a half-year, and I figure you might have forgot about this request, Jyoshu, but I'd really like to get some of your sources, as this is something that is very much of interest to me (I am very interested in \"biblical\" archaeology, and how much of the OT is actually historically accurate - not much from what I've seen).\n \n Thanks.",

   "What does it mean to believe something? I believe that today is Sunday, October 1, 2006, that democracy is a good idea and that my cat is gray and white. If you had reason to question the validity of any of those claims, you might ask me why I believed the way I did. I could show you a calendar, state my reasons supporting democracy and show you my cat. If my support of those reasons were good enough, you would likely believe as I do. \n \n If you gave me a cogent argument against democracy, I may change my mind or conclude that we disagree on that topic. We could say that we respect each other's beliefs, because we each have advanced a reasonable argument in support of our beliefs.\n \n If, however, you said today is Tuesday, December 20, 1845 or that my cat is plaid, I rightly could not respect those beliefs. If you supported your statement by telling me you read it in some very old and venerated book, that would do nothing to alter my feelings about your beliefs. Assuming we are speaking the same language, it is quite clear that my cat is not plaid and it simply cannot possibly be 1845.\n \n No where in human discourse do we expect anyone to respect beliefs simply because one holds them. There are either good reasons to hold a belief or there are not. If there are valid facts for a belief, others will not only respect that belief, but they will likely and immediately believe the same. If one has beliefs that are not supported by facts, one would quite reasonably defer in sharing those beliefs and correctly would not respect them.\n \n If I do not respect some senseless belief, I have done that holder of those beliefs no harm. I have not offended him. I am not \"prejudiced against\" him. Even if he believes very strongly, gets great comfort and places much importance in those beliefs, that should not alter my position that I have no respect for preposterous beliefs. It also is irrelevant that a great number of others believe similarly. That's simply how reasonable thinking adults behave if we are to have any intellectual integrity.\n \n It is hopefully obvious where this is leading. Religious beliefs are the only province of human dialogue in which we are expected to respect beliefs that are nonsensical, violent or stubbornly intolerant to any opposing beliefs. It is worse than that. If we speak up about not respecting ideas that are simply not worthy of any respect, we are felt to be committing offensive and outrageous behavior. It is simply taboo to state the obvious, that many religious beliefs are simply untenable, and it is lunacy to encourage belief in ideas that are based on the texts of primitive peoples of centuries ago. \n \n If one speaks up, one is branded as impolite at best, or as a heretic at worst. Isn't it time for us to start speaking up anyway? Isn't it time we no longer allow these archaic and sometimes antisocial beliefs to continually go unchallenged. It is simply not reasonable for an adult to support a belief by saying some book said so - that it tantamount to the childhood response of \"because!\" It clearly is time to address spirituality in a more mature and thoughtful way than adhering to outmoded and potentially dangerous dogmas of antiquity.\n\n \n I cannot agree with you more! Throughout my life I have met people & received e-mails expressing their belief in God through various means. By sending Prayer chain letters, how good their life has been since they found Christ, telling me that without Christ I was going to burn \"in the liquid fires of hell\", etc. But, they get offended when I question their belief in God??? Just does not seem right, does it? At times I feel like a gay person wanting to come out of the closet and say to the world, I am an atheist and I want to have the same right to express my opinion as religious people have, without \"offending\" them.",
