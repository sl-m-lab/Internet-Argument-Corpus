   "Just before you guys start accusing me of stuff, I really don't care about gun control and stuff, I just put a big lock on my door and keep a butcher knife handy. So remeber I am neutrul so please don't go accusing me of like, being a closed-minded something or other!\n \n From were I sit (canada) it seems the founding fathers didn't put the 2nd ammedment into your guys bill of rights cause the british were coming. It was proabably a big concern, but has anybody really thought about it. Back then, with enough infantry, even with the worst guns, you could win a war agiasnt the goverment. Now I was thinking, maybe this is like a contingency plan. Maybe the founding fathers knew that because all humans are corruptable, that the democratic system could be corruptable as well, and they said, \"well, in the event the goverment should destroy our bill of rights and dismantle all the stuff we love so much, to keep the population from becoming like the people under a dictator, lets arm them so they can defend themselves in the event the safeguards we already are putting in place fail. \n Could this be a possiblity or did the founding fathers think they were like a mouse who just stole a block of cheese and was waiting for the *snap*. \n \n This is the greatest arguement I have heard for guns. But nowadays the population can be split up, the media subjegatted, certian people killed, and others baught off. And the tactics don't work anymore. The goverment would mop the floor with the population. So why do people keep using this to defend guns? \n \n So tell me which side your own and why, I really want to see the opinions on this!\n \n excuse by bad spelling please.",

   "O.k., lets go through your scenario. The government has been toppled and the standing army has been crushed. Somehow all Americas nuclear arms were obliterated. The invading force has successfully instituted a dictatorship and is now systematically destroying our personal freedoms. \n \n Now suppose the year is 1799 and the population rises up. The five rounds with 200 million guns, works. The population overthroughs the invading army through sheer numbers, though the price is high in terms of casualties. America is once again free and the democratic system is once again put in place.\n \n The year is 2004, the population is no longer fit and tough from working in the fields to get their own food. But each of the 400 million people has a gun, with lets say 30 rounds each. The population now has 12 billion rounds, and lets assume each round is an armour piercing bullet with long range capabilities, and lets also assume for the hell of it, that each gun is a machine gun with long-range single shot abilities and a scope (just for fun). \n \n Same situation, same invading force. The population rises up, taking along with them the few remaining rockets and bombs from the few remaining weapons caches. Lets say 2 million hand-held anti-plane missiles, 4 million anti-tank missiles and for even more fun, lets say they have a genius military leader who has somehow the ability to maintain instant contact with any unit anywhere, and is the greatest tactical mind the planet has ever know.\n \n To overthrough the standing American army the invading force must have had massive numbers of planes, tanks and naval units. \n \n First off, 4 million anti-tank weapons is not much when put against 400 million people, so you have a lot of venerable areas. Where ever the militia units try to form, they are killed by tanks, even though many of the tanks with infantry backing are destroyed the army keeps going because to over through America who has the greatest tanks in the world, you would have to have like 10-1 ratio on the American armed divisions. \n \n But, wait. Lets assume somehow the ground forces of well-organized troops and tanks is defeated by the population. Lets assume the invading army again somehow lost all its ground units, lets pretend the enemy forces had exactly 4 million tanks, and the ratio of shot-to-kill was perfect. \n \n To defeat the American army of planes you would, again, have to have massive numbers (or technology superior planes). So the population tries shooting down the planes, but the planes would usually get away because modern planes can take out a ground-based target with out ever going closer the a couple miles. \n \n But again, wait. Somehow, without losing so many troops as not to be able to defeat the massive mechanized occupying force, all planes are spotted (miles away) and shoot down by the UNTRAINED militia. The genius military leaders (who no body though to kill) work no doubt. \n \n Yet still, the population is defeated because if I remember correctly, the militia doesn&#8217;t have naval units. So even if all the inland forces could be killed, the majority of costal forces would be protected by barrages from the enemy naval force (which is very large because it had to defeat the American navy, the greatest in the world technologically).\n \n But lets assume, the population just swims to the invading ships, kills the crews, and uses the ships they stole to kill the other enemy ships. Thank god for that tactical genius at the helm of the American resistance. \n \n I am actually guessing that invading force must be like 20 times bigger then America&#8217;s armies for one simple reason. The only way you could defeat the American ICBMs is to have a blitzkrieg (I know my spelling sucks) like attack. Most of the ICBM silos aren't connected to the internet, mainly because the government knows the silos would be venerable to internet attack, so any rebuttal involving the virus-like disabling of the nuclear stockpile is gone.\n \n Now, you may be wondering what am I trying to say here. Well its simple, if somehow, just somehow, the entire military force of the U.S. was obliterated, it would take just one ICBM hit on the enemy's capital city to make attack impossible. \n \n Again, the blitzkrieg like attack? Even if that worked the U.S., like Russia and a few other nuclear powers, keeps stockpiles of nuclear weapons hidden underground in the invent of being taken over, and the underground stockpiles usually have several rockets with enough range to blast the heck out of the closest invading army. So it would never happen that the U.S. would be left nuclear-naked.\n \n But lets assume that happened (maybe during a really, REALLY cool party some idiot colonel peed on them, and they just fried). The genius military commander did somehow take out the entire invading force of air, ground and sea. You still have to deal with the fact that whoever invaded the U.S. probably spend several trillion doing it ( I know, that&#8217;s a pretty low number for the invasion of America), and in that case most likely have satellites and long-range missiles (again lets assume somehow America&#8217;s own just fell out of the sky and the invading force got even guys together to be able to take out all America&#8217;s nuclear silos including the underground stockpiles which each have own guard forces of soldiers training night and day for such an event). \n \n The hugest, most glaring problem with the militia, unless every one the 400 million militia units somehow got a radio and a laptop, they would have to gather. And if they gathered in the numbers they would need to gather in, to order to defeat the large invading army, they would be taken out very easily by 1. ICBMs launched from enemy subs 2. Prominent meetings between our military genius and his supporters stopped by snipers with a 1.5 mile range and superb training and intelligence (remember those satellites) 3. all groups preparing for \"battle\" so to speak could be taken out as they are marching or driving or whatever by mortars, ambushes, rockets, infantry rushes, tank columns etc. before they knew what hit them.\n \n 4. It would take a lot of planning to get 400 million people to fight, and assuming everybody has a laptop with wireless capability, they would still need satellites for the military genius in California to command units in N.Y., N.Y., and....wait America&#8217;s satellites are gone and if the invading force could do that, it wouldn't be that hard to take out commercial internet satellites in geoscyhronize orbit (effectively sitting ducks). And any land based networks would be destroyed in the first few hours of insurrection. \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n But militia units only have guns, and they would get their butts whooped, even with massive numbers. What you are saying is only true about Napoleonic tactics, in today&#8217;s modern warfare almost completely infantry-based armies are obsolete and very venerable \n \n No the afghan war is not a valid counterpoint, the terrain was different, the people are more hardened, the weapons were supplied by a military power superior to the Russians, the afghans had unlimited anti-tank reserves, had incredibly extensive cave networks in which to hide, plan and attack, only had to defeat, on the majority, other infantry battalions because of the terrain in which armoured vehicles could not cross, the Russians were under funded and their moral low, the soviets had already been beaten down by large amounts of smaller fights across the cracking Soviet Empire, china needed to be supplied with more troops as it started to look toward independence, Afghanistan is nowhere near water eliminated the possibility of naval back-up by the very crappy Russian naval forces, the afghans received help from the rest of the Arab world which would not happen with the U.S. because if an enemy can take out the U.S., it could probably take out the combined forces of Europe and North America, and, finally, the afgans didn't have nukes so they had to defend themselves with their own two hands, but america has nukes and if ever anything tryed to do what is in the above senario they would get blasted because unlike the russians in afganhistan, the americans would be defended their homeland. \n \n Neither is the French revolution a good-counter point, as I have said, your tactics only work with Napoleonic-style battles and guess what kind of battle were happening when Napoleon the 3rd was in power? (in case you didn't learn it in school, Napoleon the 3rd, napoleon's nephew, was in power during the french revolution) \n \n Trust me, cause the only thing I love more then physics is military tactics and warfare. \n \n ----As I have shown in more detail, Treat2 is right, it wouldn't work.------\n \n \n The other amendments don't pertain to retaining the sovereignty of the U.S.A, they pertain to the basic rights each citizen enjoys and therefore will always be important and \"In Fashion\" so long as the U.S. still has human citizens. \n \n Please opinions only, not baseless assumptions using limited military knowledge, or rebuttals to previous opinions.",

   "Whether or not the 2nd Amendment was written to provide for the protection of the States from a foreign invasion, or border dispute, or Civil War, it is clear that the objective of the 2nd Amendment is to address the basic provisions and control required to form a militia reporting to the President. \n \n One of the provisions to form a militia is explicitly stated in the \n 2nd Amendment as the unrestricted Right of the individual to own guns. \n \n At that time in our history, when a militia was formed, it was expected that individuals would bring their own gun(s) to the militia. That provision is THE IMPLICIT PURPOSE of the Right of the individual to own guns.\n \n Within the 2nd Amendment, there are NO OTHER IMPLICIT, NOR EXPLICIT purposes pertaining to the unrestricted Right of the individual to own gun(s). \n \n In other words, the 2nd Amendment does NOT IMPLICITLY, NOR EXPLICITLY suggest or expand its purpose beyond what it required for a militia, and the control of a militia.\n \n The 2nd Amendment does NOT provide an individual the Right to own gun(s) for the PURPOSE OF providing for: food, self-defense, target practice, a hobby as a collector, or fun..\n \n Therefore, ANY OTHER PURPOSE OR REASON for the possession of guns that has been attributed to rights under the 2nd Amendment is based entirely upon thoughts and purposes that were NOT IN THE MINDS OF the Founding Fathers when the 2nd Amendment was written.\n \n The Founding Fathers knew many people required guns to provide for food, income, and home-defense. Yet, the Founding Fathers did not separate the purpose of the unrestricted Right of individuals to own guns for a militia, from the SOLE PURPOSE of owning guns for the creation of a militia.\n \n The Founding Fathers did not write the 2nd Amendment in a manner that\n would even suggest that the Right of an individual to own guns had purposes beyond a militia, that would provide for: food, self-defense, target practice, a hobby as a collector, or fun..\n \n We may therefore conclude that, any reason or purpose for an individual owning a gun, OTHER THAN for a militia, is not provided for under the 2nd Amendment, and that current gun laws for private ownership of guns is mistaken.\n \n Justifications or reasons to provide individuals with a Right to own guns for a purpose or reason other than a militia, would have to be based on some Amendment, other than the 2nd Amendment, to determine if any such Right exists for individual gun ownership exists.\n \n That the Founding Fathers did not write all Amendments with the explicit and specific Rights of individuals for every condition and circumstance is self-explanatory, as the size of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution would be enormous, and the Founding Fathers would still be busy writing the Bill of Rights and a Constitution if that was the case.\n However, the Founding Fathers were very careful in their use of words and phrases, and in the logical composition of a Constitution, and that they decided not to specify other purposes exist that justify individual gun ownership, beyond a militia, in the 2nd Amendment. That decision would appear to be intentional.\n \n Although it might ideal to understand all that the Founding Fathers had in mind, when the Constitution was written, it must also be understood \n and concluded that what was the basis for a rational giving the Founding Fathers reasons to create an Amendment, and chose specific terms, phrases, and specifics, may not exist today, nor even be of any importance. \n \n For example, individuals need not carry guns from their home to where our troops will gather. Today's \"militia\" provides for the a militia's need, and an individual's need for guns. What the Founding Fathers once wrote with respect to an individual possessing a gun for the purpose of a militia and the remainder of the 2nd Amendment requires revision or elimination.",

   "The original intent and purpose of the Second Amendment was to preserve and guarantee, not grant the pre-existing right of individuals, to keep and bear arms. Although the amendment emphasizes the need for a militia, membership in any militia let alone a well regulated one, is not required to exercise the right to keep and bear arms. \n \n The Second Amendment is an individual right. It does not say the \"militia\" has the right to keep and bear arms, it says the people have that right. \n \n Though the scope of the right to keep and bear arms includes self-defense and militia duty, it also involves the right of the people to resist tyranny.

   "The argument that we needed guns to form a militia to defend the country is no longer important because as I have said, without a full armament of anti-tank and anti-plan missiles complemented by a communication network any militia armed solely with guns would be obliterated. Napoleonic tactics dictate the size of the invading force can usually indicate the likeliness of success, but in today&#8217;s warfare that is far from true. \n \n Ok, what about the idea that guns keep food on the table. How many of the gun-owners actually hunt for their food?\n \n Guns ensure our freedom. Well that is not true, because as I have said before in this day and age if the population ever tried to rage up and \"whatever\", the media could be blacked out and the cold-war strategy of compartmentalization employed. Sure a thousand guys with shot-guns is a pretty hard fighting force, but when those guys go up against a tank column and the millions of Americans waiting to spring in to action have no idea what is going on, one would tend to favour the tanks. So in closing this argument, sure armed citizens could most likely secure several military instillations, but in this event the government would respond with deadly force eliminating any chance of the sparks of rebellion spreading to other parts of the country.\n \n In closing guns (and the 2nd amendment) no longer serve the purpose they were originally intended to do, and currently the only reason I see to even make guns is to let Uncle Tom hunt ducks with his friends every other winter.",

   "In veitum (i know, bad spelling) the ground was heavily forested, and the Americans had probablys with their fire-arms. If you want a perfect example of occupation, look to Nazi-german's occupation of europe. The ground wasn't close-quarters like vietam (agian with the spelling), and the german Panzer divisions would quell any uprising quickly. Unfortunatly for the U.S., anybody big enough to conquer the U.S. of A is going to be pretty big, and pretty determined. So they wouldn't be willing to give it up without a fight, something a few guys with pistols can't do. My second point is your assuming that the same conditions would exsist. Veitnam was the stupidest tactical move the U.S. has ever made. They knew the area was a Communist Hot-spot, and that any infantry invasion wouldn't get any support and be subject to milita-like attacks. But instead of carpet-bombing the area, they send in the troops anyway. The troops, predictably, were massacred by the dozens, and the farmers, you mention, gathered and saw the enemy was weak, and lost all fear about openly charging at a landing helicopter. And farmers didn't have to come together on thier own, they were trained and forged into an army by communists during the invasion's start. \n \n I would also like to point out, that if america was conquered and you and your freinds managed to...i don't know...get some AK-47s and start shooting stuff, thats small patatos. So what, you can kill a few dozen troops, but if Iraqi is any example, you'll be draged out of your homes and bases and shot dead. Insurection sounds pretty good, but any guns you can keep now you could get through other means when america is being invaded. Think about this, what if the goverment passed out guns just before the U.S. was invaded? It would save all the problems assosiated with the weapons, and you'd still get the protection? Of course thats just an idea.\n \n Now for personal protection I would offer you carry a pistol. It may seem diffrent then what I just said, but pistols (if not operated by someone untrained) are very safe and perfect for self-protection. I would move if I thought i needed a pistol for self-protection, but still, nothing beats the glare of a pistol butt half-revealed in the sun when your walking down that street with those gangsters eyeing your wallet. You see most pistol-accidents are Accidental discharge which can be prevented by removing the clip and checking the chamber every-so-often. But letting people own ozi's is just cruel to that guys neighbors.",

   "...\n how are the 'people' in the second amendment different from the 'people' in the other amendment ... \n \n\n \n You needn't have made such a lengthy post. It is because of the misinterpretation of the 2nd Amendment that I can and do own guns! LOL!\n \n Exact words of the 2nd Amendment with punctuation included are:\n \n \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n \n The subject and purpose of 2nd Amendment is: the reason for, and provisions for a militia.\n \n If the Founding Fathers had wanted you to take an phrase from a sentence and understand it as an independent and unrelated subject, they would have either created two sentences, or two amendments.\n \n While you my be inclined to separate the sentence into two parts, like so::\n Part 1\n \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,\"\n Part 2\n \" the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n \n You will note that the 1st Part of that sentence is clearly not possible to make a sentence of Part 1, while the 2nd Part can be made into an independent sentence, and has been, by NRA supporters.\n \n There is a reason for why Part 1 can not be made into a sentence: Part 1 is THE SUBJECT of the sentence, and as I've just demonstrated, \n the 2nd Amendment was NOT intended to be torn apart into two independent parts, interpreted in any way that you would like it to be.\n \n A SENTENCE has 1 and ONLY 1 subject. The subject of the following sentence\n is the \"militia\", and no part of that sentence can be separated from the sentence and viewed out of context of that subject (i.e. the militia).\n \n \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,\n the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n \n Clearly, the entire sentence is about the reason for a militia, and how it shall be made possible: by not infringing the right of people to keep and bear arms. \n \n If the Founding Fathers were referring to keeping and bearing arms for ANY legitimate purpose, they would have said so, in a SINGLE sentence or Amendment.\n \n Three options were available to them to write an Amendment to expand upon the purpose of the 2nd Amendment (i.e. a militia), yet they chose none of those options.\n \n You can not take ANY PHRASE out of a sentence in the Constitution and apply whatever meaning you choose to, in ANY context you choose to.",

   "Actually, drawing from contemporary writing style taught at the time, the first section is not the subject clause. It was actually called the introductory clause. The purpose of the introductory clause was \"....give an example in relation to the purpose clause\" (primer for public writing, author unknown, 1854). The second clause is the purpose clause, which is designed to \"....convey the meaning of the passage\" (same source). \n \n This was fairly common in legal writings at the time, and several state constitutions have passages worded identically. Interestingly enough, there has never been a case in court of any of the state amendments being interpeted as you suggest the second amendment should be. Apparently, people feel that , despite the clear indicators of it's meaning that are conveyed in the founders other writings, as well as the historical evidence which indicates how the passage should be read and understood, there is some need to muddy the waters on what is otherwise a fairly clear statement.\n \n I believe the founders felt that they adequetly conveyed their desired message, shich is why they didn't elaborate any more. There was an earlier draft of the amendment (by madison) that was rejected that contained far less specific language.

The fact remains, the subject of the sentence i.e. the 2nd Amendment is the militia.\n The fact also remains that no part of any sentence within the Constitution can be separated from the subject of the sentence, taken out of context, and interpretted in any way that anyone chooses to.\n \n The 2nd Amendment is a single sentence about the militia, and it's entirely clear that the founding fathers wanted people to always be permitted to keep\n guns for the purpose of a militia. \n \n If the founding fathers had another purpose in mind, or wanted to expand the 2nd Amendment they had a MINIMUM of THREE ways to do it. They choose not to make two sentences, and make the 2nd Amendment about a miltia.\n \n That the founding faters were obsessed with the importance of a militia is clear throughout the Constitution. The 2nd Amendment ensures a militia can exist, by not permitting the right to keep and bear Arms for that purpose to by infringed by anyone.\n \n Just one problem... the year is 2004, not 177X, and the 2nd Amendment is obsolete, and without purpose today.",

In US v. Miller the Supreme Court stated that the purpose of the second amendment is to \"assure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of\" the militia spoken of in Article 1 of the Constitution. \n \n \"The Constitution, as originally adopted, granted to the Congress power --\n \n 'To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions; To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.'\n \n \"With obvious purpose to assure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of such forces, the declaration and guarantee of the Second Amendment were made. It must be interpreted and applied with that end in view.\"\n \n How can you misinterpret such plain language? It clearly states what the purpose of the second amendment is.",

   "How can you misinterpret such plain language? It clearly states what the purpose of the second amendment is.\n\n \n The original intent and purpose of the Second Amendment was to preserve and guarantee, not grant the pre-existing right of individuals, to keep and bear arms. Although the amendment emphasizes the need for a militia, membership in any militia let alone a well regulated one, is not required to exercise the right to keep and bear arms. \n \n One does not have to belong to a well regulated militia in order to have the right to keep and bear arms. The militia clause is merely one, and not the only, rationale for preserving the right. The Founders were expressing a preference for a militia over a standing army. Even if today's well regulated militia were the National Guard, the Second Amendment still protects an individual right to keep and bear arms. \n \n The Second Amendment is an individual right. It does not say the \"militia\" has the right to keep and bear arms, it says the people have that right.",
