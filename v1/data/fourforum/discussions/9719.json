How about putting all of \"their\" money on a debit card that can only be used on essentials rather than booze, smokes, and Cheetos. I normally hate \"big brother\" intruding into peoples life, but when it comes to supplying welfare, I am big brother. Why should my money go to fund a raging alcohol habit?",

There are some people who will not work under any circumstances and will do work hard to avoid it\n\n \n Actually, I don't see how it would be too difficult to implement this in the first place. When everyone shows up for their check, the line starts for the bathroom first, then your check. Urine checks can even be the rapid screen tests that allow you to check for the most common drugs right on the spot. This eliminates lab fees and transportation costs. And as far as faking the tests, simply do like the FAA does when they pull me off the flight line for a random screen; have someone physically stand there and watch. It's pretty hard to fake a pee test when someone is looking directly at your \"stuff\". In this sick country you would probably have people lined up around the block for that job.",

   "IIRC, most funds from 'welfare' already are on a debit style card. Alcohol and such can't be bought with it. The only cash on them that could be used would be from the likes of those who have child support garnished to them from the father of their kids as handled by the gov't or for spousal support.\n \n There are other scams to turn gov't funds into real cash. Trading the old paper food stamps for less cash used to be one...thus the introduction of the cards. Still scams abound and always will.\n \n I'd simply have semi-random drug testing as a requirement for freebies. Not much planning or cost and less hassle. Furthermore, someone suspected of fraud or abuse could also be tested.",

   "These quotes truly scare me to death. Is this kind of behaviour by the government and by the corporations considered to be normal? You guys talk about it in such a nonchalant way. \n\n \n Not sure why that scares you. People find very inventive ways of faking drug tests all the time. Bags or condoms of clean urine taped to themselves or \"inserted\" in various areas, urine additives designed to foil drug testing, and even fake genitals (male) are used to try to scam tests. For people flying heavy planes loaded with 100's of people, it's a good idea to be sure of the results. I don't see a problem with drug testing those who are charged with the safety of others. On the other hand, drug testing the guy who makes my coffee at Starbucks is rediculous and completely worthless. As long as he can get my half-caf non-fat latte right, who cares.",
