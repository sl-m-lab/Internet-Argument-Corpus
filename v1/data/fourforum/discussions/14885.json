Instead of criticizing the obviously daft idea of a Republican senator, you instead make it out to be the fault of the 'liberals', a term so obviously out of place here that it just proves people are incapable of having an adult debate but instead descend to \"anything that I don't like is the fault of the 'liberals'\".\n \n Not that the other side are any better. I'm truly amazed with the reaction over this shooting. How, before any evidence has come to light over the actual facts behind this event, do Democrats appear to be blaming the Republicans for it? I find it absurd that people can make such serious accusations over something where we know so little about what happened.\n \n How about actually debating politics by considering opinions and making informed decisions based on facts, rather than just bashing the perceived opponent as much and as often as possible, and damn any logic or facts that might get in the way? \n \n Back to the point in question, this is a daft idea put out by a single senator with will doubtless be rightfully ignored.

If this new legislation is necessary -- and it might well be a reactionary redundancy, but if it is necessary -- it will merely be so by way of clarification and formalization. It hardly seems radical.\n \n And I really don't see Krugman's article as so bad. He rather one-sidedly omits that in earlier decades, the left was the worse side (think of groups like the Weathermen or the Black Panthers). But at present, the most violent rhetoric is coming from the right. Glenn Beck said he could see himself choking the life out of Michael Moore, for example, while Ann Coulter has suggested that people \"perform a procedure\" with a rifle on abortion providers. These kinds of comments are far beyond mere mockery and ridicule -- which aren't always pleasant, but are certainly legal -- and they have no place in a democratic society. I don't think it's wrong to point out how wrong such comments are.\n\n \n The thread was about legislation that would criminalize use of any language of image that could be interpreted as a threat against a public official. Meaning if the definition of such is left openly broad, then anyone who protests with a message against actions of the government and calling for drastic reform could be faced with a felony charge against them.\n \n Let's consider the fact that the Founding Fathers didn't shy away from harsh language, such as watering the tree of liberty with the blood of tyrants, which has been used a number of times in recent history with Tea Party members. No violence was carried out, but some of these modern day cowards could claim that they were being threatened with such language.",

   "I'm sure everyone remembers H.R 3355.. Well if you want to get technical the republicans voted for this ban the same as the Democrats...Check the Vote record...\n\n \n The only reason H.R. 3355 got the republican vote was because the AWB had a sunset provision so it would eventually go away, it wasn't a permanent ban nor could it ever be made into such. Had the language of the ban not included this provision, or lacked a grandfather clause, I fail to see how the bill would've ever been passed.\n \n And since then no such ban will get momentum to be passed on a federal level ever again. It keeps getting introduced but it goes absolutely nowhere.",

   "and I still disagree. They have a great place in our society. Without the extremes you can't have a center.\n \n I find Paul Krugman a complete XXXXX but I'm glad he is writing and I read his column often. Likewise many people who hate Beck listen to his show. You never know when they actually might have a good point.\n\n \n And yet - as Krugman himself pointed out - there is difference between mockery and ridicule, on the one hand, and advocating or downplaying violence, on the other. The latter runs contrary to the whole idea of democracy in the first place.\n \n So when I hear Beck ponder choking his opponents, or Coulter using rifles on her opponents, I do NOT regard such comments as morally acceptable. The issue is not whether they ever have any other interesting or useful comments to make. The issue is whether these kinds of comments are either interesting or useful, ever. I humbly submit the answer is a resounding \"No,\" and I wish more people would let them know it, instead of excusing it.",

   "It's ridiculous to think that the Liberals are the only ones trying to take Gun Rights away from the American people. All this BullXXXX about Obama taking our guns is nothing more than Right Wing Political rhetoric used to gain voter support. When are people going to realize that BOTH parties are responsible for doing this... There are plenty of Democrats in the House and Senate who support our second amendment rights just as there are Republicans.\n\n \n a.) I didn't say democrats, I said liberals. There are liberal Republicans (depending on the issue) and there are conservative democrats (depending on the issue) Indeed some conservatives voted for that crimes bill, but it was before we realized the degree of infringement.\n \n b.) The Congress came to regret their vote--the repeal was voted down 8-90.\n \n c.) the assault weapons ban was a tack on to the larger bill--it should have been it's OWN bill so members could vote against it yet still be able to vote for the provisions against crime.\n \n d.) Over-reaction is often a response, everyone knows that (who doesn't have his head in the sand, anyway). Look at the Brady bill. (CNN is interviewing them today--gee, imagine that--CNN interviews the country's most outspoken anti-2nd amendment person)\n It would be different if these were not constitutional guarantees; THAT'S what makes gun control unconstitutional.\n \n \nNot to mention the FACT that the President of the U.S. Does not and never has had the sole authority to take our Guns or enact a Law to do so. \n\n \n Straw man. No one said the president can do that alone.\n But you're deluded if you think Democrats aren't the gun control party.",

But if someone calls for watering the tree of liberty with the blood of a specific official, or uses Jefferson's quote to menace a real official in person, those are different situations. As the Supreme Court has said with regard to incitement cases for over a century, you can decry a company as angrily and rudely as you want, even in public -- but if you do so in front of a mob of folks already venting their anger against the company right in front of the company's headquarters, then you're going to get charged with incitement as soon as a brick flies through the window.\n \n The potential for over-broadness in crafting legislation, or in subsequently applying it, is a real danger. That said, the encouragement of violence is a not something that must be tolerated. Unless, I suppose, one is prepared to argue that rights imply anarchism.",
