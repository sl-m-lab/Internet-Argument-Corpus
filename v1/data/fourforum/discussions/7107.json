I also value the lives of all human beings that are already mentally existing (that is where I personally draw the line with abortions - at the beginning of mental existance). However, the developing body prior to that mental existence has much less worth than the already existing person. Every unfertilized egg is a potential person whose future existence you are cutting short based on lack of action or (in the case of contraceptives or abortion) action.

I am happy that contraception was not used. I am happy that my parents had sex when they did so that that particular egg and sperm united to form me. I am happy that my parents met at all.

If it is the potential of personhood that is important, not whether the being in question is a person *at that moment*, then any deprivation of that potential is bad. From the point of view of the potential person (if you can even think of such a concept), then why would it be worse stopping their potential by not conceiving them, vs. stopping their potential right around the time of conception through contraceptives, vs. stopping their potential a few months down the line, but still before they become an actual person.
