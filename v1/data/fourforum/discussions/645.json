Murder is the killing of one indivisual. Murder is not commited to a willful and desiring of death person. It instead is done to someone who does not wish to die (in most cases).\n Suicide on the other hand is done by your choice. You want to end your life and if thats truly what you want to do then its not murder. Murder has two parties involved. The murderers and the victims. Suicide has one person involved.\n \n \nMany people tried to kill themselves unsuccessfuly and continued living a great life. If your life sucks now, it could become better in the future.

Laws exist for no other reason than to provide a common basis upon which to decide what is right and worng, hence moral. There must be an absolute idea of right and wrong. Life is precious. This is the moral foundation for laws such as no murder, no suicide and therefore no euthanasia for humans. It is a fundamental belief of all societies that human life is of great value. If we cheapen it by saying that pain is reason enough to end it then we subvert the very foundation of our society.\n \n This is why I bring up the mentally challenged. If we say that the terminally ill should have the right to die, then we necessarily begin down a road where the value of life is decreased. That is why those arguments are not separable.

Why should anyone tell me I don't have the right to DIE?\n\n \n The number of references to a \"self\" in these statements are 8...in just three sentences. Suicide, in most cases, is a very self-centered act. Before the issue of whether it is legal or not, we should consider the act. A selfish, self-centered person is concerned with only the self. When a person becomes too caught up in a world that has been created to revolve around yours truly, they tend to be very lonely people who are unable to have a relationship. I know a few depressed people who fit this description, and I know that as long as they care about only themselves, they will never know love or hope. What is life without reason and something other than yourself to care about? Nothing. This is what brings about thoughts of suicide. On the issue of legality, what's it matter? It's not like the person commiting the act will be punished. If there were a way to stop suicide simply by keeping it illegal, I would be all for keeping it illegal. I don't believe self-centered people should be allowed a cowards way out.

   "Greetings friends,\n \n I am new to these boards and I wish to add my own sentiment to this particular topic of debate.\n \n It is extremely difficult to argue a topic without attempting to a find the root or purpose for its existence. Without a 'philosophical' beginning, we are all really just stating opinions and butting heads. The only solution that has been presented thus far is that everyone has the right to do as they wish.\n \n I am nay in favor of suicide/euthanasia on the grounds that it is unethical, consequential, and just plain ignorant.\n \n Suicide is unethical. The human race's success as a species relies on our capability to learn and work together. The absence of a single member, particularily a juvenile one, holds great bearing on our present and future. Each individual is a human resource capable of great things if they so wish it. \n \n Suicide has negative consequences on our environment. The act of suicide causes others pain, grief, uneeded hardship, and sends a negative message to others around the victim. By committing suicide, the family and friends of the selfish victim are torn apart. Their lives become a wreck as they try to determine what went wrong. They may become insecure and feel inadequate as parents and friends. In addition to their grief, they will also need to pay your '$5,000 minimum' burial expense. The victim may also become a role model for other's who wish to prematurely end their lives. One may also create unnecessary hazards and risks while attempting to commit suicide which may lead to the deaths of others.\n \n Suicide is just ignorant. Yes, those who seek to end their own lives are emmotionaly unstable and intellectually sterile. Unable to cope with their problems, which are typically trivial, they end their lives rather than to simply move on. The death of a loved one, getting dumped by a loved one, catching a serious STD, loss of a job, loss of material possessions, money, even a terminal illness. These are all trivial and could happen to anyone. The question is, what do you do when its your turn? If you don't believe in magic and miracles, it's probably time you started. Quit worrying about your problems and help others with theirs. If the illness is terminal, focus on love, joy, and fullfillment of what time is left.\n \n \"Well, it's my body, I can do what I want with it!\" It most certainly is your body, and unfortunately, you can do what you want with it. This means that everytime a nine-year-old is dumped by his girlfriend, he has an obligation to hang himself from the closet and it is perfectly okay, right? A guy decides to jump off of a bridge to commit suicide. Two police officers jump over to save him. He washes up on the shore and lives. The officers do not. You may think that this is stupid, but it happens. A guy shoots himself, dead center, in his forehead and lives....as a vegetable. No matter what you do, there is always a possibility for failure and you will always cause harm to someone else whether it be mental or physical.\n \n \"Why is suicide illegal? That's so dumb!\" Yea well, we as human beings can't bare to finish job you started, so we offer to throw you in jail. Consider it attempted murder on yourself.\n \n \"What about euthanasia?\" Alright, you are afraid or incapable of murdering yourself, so you want someone else to do it? Jeffrey Dalmer would have been happy to oblige. Oh, the pain, the pain... Get over it. If your only worrying about your pain, your not worrying about others' pain and you simply do not find value and love in life. If you did, the pain would be minimal.\n \n \"How can you love life if your dying and in pain!!!\" How can you ever not love life? New born babies, nursery rhymes, scribbling in coloring books, crayons, chicken noodle soup, spaghetti O's, Dopey from Snow White, puppies with waggly tails, girls with cooties, saturday morning cartoons, eating the marshmellows out of Lucky Charms, briefs with He-Man on them, Transformer action figures, your first kiss, your first... yea....There is just to much too appreciate, but if you don't try, you've already confined yourself to death.\n \n In the end, no matter how you look at it, you've caused more harm and suffering than you've prevented to yourself. You are not free. This is not a free country. Even if it is your body, your government owns you whether you like it or not. You are a resource, valuable or otherwise. You do not have the right to cause harm to yourself or your loved ones, and thus, you do not have the right to commit suicide.\n \n And that's my two cents.\n \n \n Thank you,\n Leviathan",

   "[QUOTE=reetika]\nEuthanasia and suicide are something which every person should have the right to. \n \n i think euthanasia and suicide should not be made legal.It is right to say that it is \" My Body and My life\".But to come to think of it the circumstances when such acts are thought of are more less than often those time when a person feels down and out with life,for whatever reason..he feels dejected and in such circumstances he is bound to make decisions which unfortunately enough he would'nt have the chance to regret..and most unfortunately enough live the life he has given up in haste.Death is not a solution to a problem..it should be tackled in a more mature manner.once euthanasia is legalised the time would not be far when it would be exploited and would take an evil shape, and moreso the life givers would become mere life takers..\n\n \n \n Oh you mean like in the Netherlands where Doctors decide who they want to put to sleep?",

The doctor can decide to withhold or cease treatment if continuing treatment is pointless, and only serves to prolong pain and suffering.

Nature is then allowed to take its course, and the patient will die, but it does not constitute euthanasia. \n \n \n \n See? The Docter can decide to withold treatment if he decides it's pointless.

   "I haven't read much on this thread about religion. (I could have missed something.) Does not the Catholic Church hold that some eternal punishment will follow suicide?\n \n I personally believe suicide should be discouraged and that people with such tendencies need our help. It should not be illegal. There should however, be some way to extract payment for damages caused to other people's property during the implementation of the suicide...like damage to another vehicle when the suicide is committed by deliberately crashing into a bus, or the clean up costs of getting the blood and guts off the pavement when someone jumps from a building. We certainly can't let these people off scot-free.\n \n On euthanasia, if a person wrote, signed and recorded a \"living will\" while that person was of sound mind and body, stating their preference not to suffer a lingering death, they should be allowed to die at the hands of a euthanasianist, like Dr. Kervorkian. That would save the family and the country a lot of money and decrease the grief among us.\n \n (This has nothing to do with youth in Asia.) emoticon_xbye",
