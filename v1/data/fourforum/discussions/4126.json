   "RELATIVE PRIVATION - To try to make a phenomenon appear good, by comparing it with a worse phenomenon, or to try to make a phenomenon appear bad, by comparing it with a better phenomenon. \n \n Consider junkfood. A very nutritionally-conscious person has a rather low \n opinion of junkfood. But what would be your attitude toward a greasy hamburger if you hadn't eaten for three or four days? You can malign junkfood because your nutritional standards are high enough to permit you to do so. But an Ethiopian would like nothing better than to have access to MacDonald's, Hardee's or Wendy's and, in fact, such access would be the best thing that could happen to the Ethiopian. Because you have alternatives that the Ethiopian does not have, he is in a position of relative privation when compared to you. \n \n In just the same way, the people who labored in sweatshops at the turn of the century were in a state of relative privation when compared to you. Because your alternatives are different (and much better), the sweatshop eems to you to be an abomination, but in fact the sweatshop was immensly preferable to the alternatives available to them. \n \n \"Eat your carrots! Just think of all the starving children in China.\" \n \"I used to lament having no shoes - until I met a man who had no feet.\" \n \n The real danger from this last example of the fallacy is that if people believe that their own situation really is ameliorated by such a comparison, they will naturally conclude that their own situation can, in practice, actually BE ameliorated by MAKING somebody else worse off!\n\n Handbook of Logical Fallacies\n http://www.rkba.org/libertarian/king/Fallacies",

The destruction of the core family unit and value system. This also is a result from the first point.\n \n Gay Marriage does have a drastic affect on our society. People talk about rights and that it's their right to be married if they so choose. The problem with this is that usually when someone exercises \"their right\" it many times infringes on someones elses rights. What about my right to not have my children exposed to Public homosexuality behavior.\n \n The problem is that the many people whose stance on this issue is \"it's not causing any harm and it's none of our business\" take such a stance because they don't want a finger pointing back at them for something that they do wrong. That yields the arguement that all of us who are against such things are hypocrits. Being a Christian, I can tell you that Christianity is not comprised of a group of perfect people. In fact, the whole sacrafice of Jesus Christ was needed because of humanity's sinful nature. Just because we are not perfect does not dismiss our responibility to denouce the sin in peoples' lives as well as in our own.\n \n And as far as the devoices go in our traditional marriages, that is also a problem that should be addressed. Committment should be taken much more serious, but two wrongs does not make a right. We need to move forward and fix America's families and their problems, not support something that will eventually erase its very existence.",

   " Do you know how many of the other, more important, problems come about? Many of the serious problems this country faces today stem from two things: 1. No fear of God. When I say fear, I say it not to describe a scared nature, but to describe true love, respect, and a recognition that he is Lord over our lives and is in complete control.\n\n \n This is nonsense. You don't need fear of God or God, and the \"loss of God\" argument is nonsense, since the near majority of Americans are Bible-Fundamentalists, and the highest rates of teen pregnancy and some of the worst crime comes out of the Bible Belt.\n \n God doesn't exist outside of human creation. He's a little imaginary figure you made up in order to make yourself feel better at night beacause you aren't the centre of the Universe. Stop pushing your fake deity.\n \n \n \n Gay Marriage does have a drastic affect on our society.\n\n \n Prove it. Got any credible scientific or sociological studies? NOPE, ya don't. Didn't think so.\n \n \n \n\n People talk about rights and that it's their right to be married if they so choose. \n\n \n You are not violating the rights of anyone else, and everyone has the right to self-determination. Marriage is a Universal Human Right. Autonomy and self deterimination rights are linked to Duties.\n \n \n \n\n The problem with this is that usually when someone exercises \"their right\" it many times infringes on someones elses rights. \n\n \n Don't even think about contriving how gay marrige violates YOUR RIGHTS assmonkey. That's the most ludicrous, inane statement I have yet heard from the Religious Right.\n \n \n \n \n\n What about my right to not have my children exposed to Public homosexuality behavior\n\n \n Too bad, so sad. I don't want to be exposed to public heterosexual love and behavior. Your argument is fundamentally flawed, because if you just substitute the subjects and nouns, you can do the same argument from the opposite side.\n \n secondarily, there is no RIGHT not to be offended. Period. There is no ethical system that says \" anything I find I don't like or offensive I may outlaw.\"\n \n Perhaps I feel that YOU are offensive? Can I outlaw you? I don't want my children exposed to people like you, therefore, lets put you all away somewhere so we can't see you.\n \n \n The problem is that the many people whose stance on this issue is \"it's not causing any harm and it's none of our business\" take such a stance because they don't want a finger pointing back at them for something that they do wrong. \n\n \n Nope bubba. They don't do it because of that. They do it because it's none of your fraking business and you ought to keep your mouth shut about what other people do that harms no one.\n \n \n \n\n That yields the arguement that all of us who are against such things are hypocrits. Being a Christian, I can tell you that Christianity is not comprised of a group of perfect people.\n\n \n At least you said one thing correctly.\n \n \n \n\n In fact, the whole sacrafice of Jesus Christ was needed because of humanity's sinful nature. \n\n \n Jesus was a retarded ancient hippie who walked passed people who were starving and dying, yet didn't help them. Jesus is a man who ignored his family and considered his disciples family instead. Jesus is a man who didn't come to preach peace, but use a sword.\n \n Jesus is a man who didn't repudiate much of the Old Testament atrocities. Jesus is bad, and Jesus is GOd, therefore God is bad. I don't care what the biblical stoner said.\n \n \n\n Just because we are not perfect does not dismiss our responibility to denouce the sin in peoples' lives as well as in our own.\n\n \n Your Imaginary God put forth imaginary sins. No one is responsible for following Biblical morality, which is nothing more than a mere travesty. You want Biblical marriage? How bout you look up with Biblical marriage REALLY entailed. Then you will change your bigoted tune.\n \n \n \n And as far as the devoices go in our traditional marriages, that is also a problem that should be addressed. Committment should be taken much more serious, but two wrongs does not make a right. We need to move forward and fix America's families and their problems, not support something that will eventually erase its very existence.\n\n \n The same bogus argument wrapped up in a new package. GAY MARRIAGE DESTROYS MARRIAGE!! DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU cAN STILL MARRY WHOMEVER YOU WANT. DUHHHHHHHHHH rocket sience here.",
