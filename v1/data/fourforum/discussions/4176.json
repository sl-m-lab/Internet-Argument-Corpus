   "THE PARADOX OF BOURGEOIS MORALITY & FEMINISM  \n \n The vast majority of suicide victims in Australia are male, \n but god forbid if a Faculty is not dominated by female staff! \n \n The vast majority of violent deaths are males, \n but god forbid if females lag behind male CEOs! \n \n The vast majority people in jail (97%) are male, \n but god forbid if the bourgeois police are underrepresented by females! \n \n The vast majority of homeless people in Australia are male, \n but god forbid if a female body is portrayed as anything but a divine entity! \n \n Females outlive males (this means females get to savor life longer than males), \n but god forbid if one uses male pronouns in HIS assignments! \n \n The vast majority of all child abuse is committed by females against males, \n but god forbid if this statistic is identified in the literature! \n \n Bourgeois feminists demand to be EQUAL to males in every way in Australia, and yet they remain SILENT when it comes to the nasty dimensions of male 'privileges'. More, they are contemptuous! \n \n Now here is a question for toady bourgeois academics: As a man, and being conversant in these gender facts, why should I give a single toss about greedy bourgeois women demanding to outdo male CEOs, when men are killing themselves at a FASTER pace than the national road toll? Which issue is more deserving of attention...of empathy? \n \n Hmm maybe I have my priorities mixed up....maybe materialism, domination and power for women is more important than male homelessness, suicide, imprisonment, ill health, unemployment, abuse, alienation and so on. \n \n Feminism is bourgeois morality par excellence: it's all about divvying up the spoils of materialism and elitism, it has little to do with social justice (Indigenous males have a life expectancy of 45 years - where are the feminist screeches?) \n \n Feminism is a fallacious (and malicious) ethic, benefiting the bourgeois classes, further compounding the grief of the oppressed. It gives nothing to the average man on the street, it takes from him, and then after stripping him - its blames him! \n \n We often hear the grievance how bosses are mainly male! Yes it is really unfair, why the poor and enslaved live for the day when they can wake up to a world of 'balanced' elitism in which an equal proportion of the bosses are female! What a SCAM, the bourgeois have brainwashed the herd to the point that they believe that by changing their masters into mistresses their lot will somehow improve. This is the biggest fallacy of feminism; it is not about equal rights, it is about equality among the bourgeois classes and the sharing of wealth and power. \n \n In terms of the struggle for authentic social justice FEMINISM is a huge impediment: it serves to aggravate the conditions of the oppressed, while at the same time disguises the material greed of the bourgeois elite.",

   "I think thast your account was suspended becasue you were acting like an idiot, as well as the fact that in your first posting, several pages were devoted merely to attempting to assist you in forming a coherent, debatable point.\n \n One of you 15 yr old kids, hop in here and beat this poster over the head with your juvenile intellect. At one time, I thought that alan ryan was going to do it, but apparently after several post he got bored with trying to draw out a coherent point to the rambling.\n \n Mc, I am interested in this statement:\n \n \nFeminism is a fallacious (and malicious) ethic, benefiting the bourgeois classes, further compounding the grief of the oppressed. It gives nothing to the average man on the street, it takes from him, and then after stripping him - its blames him! \n \n \n How exactly do you feel that feminism is benificial primarily to the bourgeois classes? \n \n First, and preferably in 1000 words or less... I am not going to go back and forth forever just trying to pry a definition out of you.....I have far less patience for simpletons than Alan ryan does), exactly what is your definition of the bourgeois? Lets try to put it into simple terms so there is no confusion.\n \n I believe that most people who refer to the \"bourgeois\" in modern times are generally referring to the wealthy (those who control the means of production). IF this is the definitaion, you prefer, I can't help but wonder how feminism benifits them at all. Only a very slim minority of wealthy women work. \n \n Poor women work, as do middle class women. It would certainly seem that feminism primarily ebnifits working women. Since we have already established that most women of the bourgeois class (assuming we are using the marxist definition) do not work, then it would ceem illogical to assign the benifits of feminism to the bourgeois.\n \n If you prefer to consider the bourgeois as being the middle class, the statement is eqally faulty, as still, the vast majority of working women, and therefore those benifiting most from the movement towards feminism, are from the lower class. I further fail to comprehend exactly what the cost is to the \"average man on the street\". Provided that a canidate is qualified for a position, I fail to understand the relevance regarding their sex. \n \n As far as the rest of your post/////I was going to ignore it, but I woud like some clarification on the opening lines:\n \n \nThe vast majority of suicide victims in Australia are male, \n but god forbid if a Faculty is not dominated by female staff! \n \n \n I fail to see the realtionship between these two, unless being more likely to kill yourself is somehow indicitive of intelligence (personally, I would tend to assume the oppisite).\n \n \nThe vast majority of violent deaths are males, \n but god forbid if females lag behind male CEOs! \n \n \n Again, I fail to see the relationship here, unless in Australia (I assume this statement is still dealing with asutralia) CEOs are given to frequent gladiatorial engagements. IS promotion in Austrialia decided by open combat? I admit I am not very knowledgable regarding Australian business practices, but I am certain I would have heard of this. It would likely be an PPV.\n \n \nThe vast majority people in jail (97%) are male, \n but god forbid if the bourgeois police are underrepresented by females! \n \n \n This one almost makes sense, at least insofar as the two are actually related. From a purely utilitarian standpoint, though, it would appear that what you are saying here is that men are by far more prone to criminal tendancies. If this is the case, logic would dictate that all police power should be handed over to women.\n \n \nThe vast majority of homeless people in Australia are male, \n but god forbid if a female body is portrayed as anything but a divine entity! \n \n \n Are you saying that homeless men in Australia are homelss because they are ugly?\n \n \nFemales outlive males (this means females get to savor life longer than males), \n but god forbid if one uses male pronouns in HIS assignments! \n \n \n Sorry, can't even see a glimmer of a relationship here. Not nearly enough to comment on.\n \n \nThe vast majority of all child abuse is committed by females against males, \n but god forbid if this statistic is identified in the literature! \n \n \n WHOA. A coherent statement. GOOD JOB! I would suggest that the majority of child abuse is comitted by females against males due to the fact that in most societies (australia included), women are generally the primary caregivers. Simply put, they spend more time with the children, so they have more opportunities to engage in abusive behavior. I would point out that male victims of child abuse FAR outnumber female victims in all categories save one, which is sexual abuse. \n \n Why is this? I frankly don't know. I suspect it has something to do with little boys generally being harder to raise than little girls. They tend to be much more aggressive, both physically and psychologically.\n \n Parenting is hard work, and frankly I can see how people who are not well balanced to begin with could turn abusive (not that this is in any way acceptable). If my personal observations bear out regarding the inherent difficulty of rtaising boys as opposed to girls is correct, logic would dictate that boys would take the brunt of an abusive parents behavior.\n \n I will actually give you this one, though I personally have not noticed a bias as far as reporting in this category. I am unfamiliar with Australian literatur on the subject, though, so I am unqualified to comment on any possible bias that may exist.\n \n \nBourgeois feminists demand to be EQUAL to males in every way in Australia, and yet they remain SILENT when it comes to the nasty dimensions of male 'privileges'. More, they are contemptuous! \n \n \n In this you seem to be suggesting that if women want to be equal to men, they need to kill themselvs more often, commit more crimes, get themselves murdered more often, and die earlier (perhaps forced euthenasia??). Is this correct? \n \n Are you on crack? Come on, you can tell us. You know, there is help available for whatever is wrong with you. Maybe some psychotropic drugs from your local psychiatrist would help.",

I will admit that when I first read it (the first time around), I did not respond because I didin't understand it, and I thought maybe I was just missing something.

It soon became apparent that I was not missing anything, the post simply did not make any sense.\n \n We all occasionally take indefensible positions, either because our logic is flawed, or sometimes just to get a decent debate going. Frankly, though, after having McB refer to the intellect here as \"juvenile\" among his various other not so subtle statements regarding how he percieves his intelligence level, I frankly expected more. \n \n I googled his little hissy fit (by entering \"but god forbid if a Faculty is not dominated by female staff\") thinking that maybe he had plajorised it, and that in contect it might make more sense.

His debate strategy seems to be largely centered around posting large amounts of semi coherent garbage. The intelligence of which he boasts appears to be decidedly substandard. This is an indvidual with some issues. Like other bigots, his position seems to be poorly concieved to the point of being nonsensical. Sigfried lays out a better, more logical argument.",
