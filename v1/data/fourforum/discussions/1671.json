Here is an excerpt from it:\n \n http://www.americanprogress.org/site/pp.asp?c=biJRJ8OVF&b=24889\nI agree the article was interesting, both for what it meant to show, as well as what it reveals inadvertently. The literary output of any think tank must be viewed with a measure of scrutiny. The Center for American Progress is a new organization that was founded by John Podesta, former chief of staff of Bill Clinton's White House. That should be good for Democrats, since they could certainly use a 'progressive' think tank to help match the conservative ones that have served Republicans so well. \n \n Thanks for providing the link, since it shows the variety of sources used in the talking points. I'll limit my feedback to the three items you included in your excerpt. \n \n \n \nLATE 2002-EARLY 2003 - CHENEY PRESSURES CIA TO CHANGE INTELLIGENCE: \"Vice President Dick Cheney's repeated trips to CIA headquarters in the run-up to the war for unusual, face-to-face sessions with intelligence analysts poring over Iraqi data. The pressure on the intelligence community to document the administration's claims that the Iraqi regime had ties to al-Qaida and was pursuing a nuclear weapons capacity was 'unremitting,' said former CIA counterterrorism chief Vince Cannistraro, echoing several other intelligence veterans interviewed.\" Additionally, CIA officials \"charged that the hard-liners in the Defense Department and vice president's office had 'pressured' agency analysts to paint a dire picture of Saddam's capabilities and intentions.\" [Sources: Dallas Morning News, 7/28/03; Newsweek, 7/28/03]\nThis item unfortunately didn't link to the Newsweek web site. Who knows, maybe the source was unavailable without subscription access. In any event, apart from this selection we don't know what else the Newsweek report might have said, or if it provided any balance to this fragment.\n \n We do know from other sources however there is more. Cheney is, after all, the VP. The initial story that reported that some analysts considered his questioning to be \"pressure\" also said that other analysts welcomed the vice president's interest. If that latter point had been the lead of the story, would it have made page one? Moreover, no one has alleged that Cheney's questioning actually produced any changes in CIA intelligence, so where's the beef?\n \n \n \nFEBURARY 24, 2003 - CIA WARNS WHITE HOUSE 'NO DIRECT EVIDENCE' OF WMD: \"A CIA report on proliferation released this week says the intelligence community has no 'direct evidence' that Iraq has succeeded in reconstituting its biological, chemical, nuclear or long-range missile programs in the two years since U.N. weapons inspectors left and U.S. planes bombed Iraqi facilities. 'We do not have any direct evidence that Iraq has used the period since Desert Fox to reconstitute its Weapons of Mass Destruction programs,' said the agency in its semi-annual report on proliferation activities.\" [NBC News, 2/24/03]\nFortunately this item includes a hypertext link to the MSNBC web site so that the reader can check for accuracy to see if NBC did in fact write what your excerpt quotes them as writing. Here, you be the judge:\n \n The excerpt you posted states:\n 'We do not have any direct evidence that Iraq has used the period since Desert Fox to reconstitute its Weapons of Mass Destruction programs,' said the agency in its semi-annual report on proliferation activities.\n \n The CIA report, as evidenced in the NBC article, states:\n \"We do not have any direct evidence that Iraq has used the period since Desert Fox to reconstitute its Weapons of Mass Destruction programs, although given its past behavior, this type of activity must be regarded as likely,\" said the agency in its semi-annual report on proliferation activities.\n \n Clearly, the talking points editor intentionally snipped a crucial phrase from the sentence that was quoted in the CIA report. That's deceitful, in my view, especially in view of the editor's failure to note with an ellipsis that a portion of the sentence has in fact been deleted. Does this constitute intellectual dishonesty, in your opinion? It is sheer hypocrisy that your resource employs such a tactic, even as it argues that the Bush administration 'cherry picked' its way through intelligence reports.\n \n \n \nMAY 30, 2003 - INTEL PROFESSIONALS ADMIT THEY WERE PRESSURED: \"A growing number of U.S. national security professionals are accusing the Bush administration of slanting the facts and hijacking the $30 billion intelligence apparatus to justify its rush to war in Iraq . A key target is a four-person Pentagon team that reviewed material gathered by other intelligence outfits for any missed bits that might have tied Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to banned weapons or terrorist groups. This team, self-mockingly called the Cabal, 'cherry-picked the intelligence stream' in a bid to portray Iraq as an imminent threat, said Patrick Lang, a official at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). The DIA was \"exploited and abused and bypassed in the process of making the case for war in Iraq based on the presence of WMD,\" or weapons of mass destruction, he said. Greg Thielmann, an intelligence official in the State Department, said it appeared to him that intelligence had been shaped 'from the top down.'\" [Reuters, 5/30/03 ]\nFirst, it's worth noting that the Reuter's source is almost legendary for sloppiness. The phrase, \"growing number of U.S. national security professionals,\" is just fluff. Getting down to the grit we find just two names given: Patrick Lang and Greg Thielmann.\n \n Reuters identifies Patrick Lang as an \"official at the DIA,\" yet Lang left the DIA back in the 1990s when Clinton was president. Passing pass him off as a DIA official in May 2003 is misleading, as it suggests that Lang is privy to recent intelligence developments. Reuter's sloppiness is par for the course, but the real irony is that Lang himself was the director of 'human intelligence' during a prime period when U.S. intel dropped the ball in Iraq. I refer of course to the decision in the 1990s not to beef up American intel in Iraq from its meager level, but rather to increasingly rely on UN inspectors and UNSCOM's data and assessments. That decision during Lang's tenure caught U.S. intelligence agencies off balance when UN inspectors were forced to leave Iraq. In the sudden absence of hard evidence regarding Iraq, intelligence analysts tended to fall back on the underlying assumptions that they had begun with, including the belief that Saddam intended to preserve his remaining WMD capabilities and acquire new ones. In view of the fact that Lang left DIA six years ago and may be motivated (in part) to divert attention from his own lapses as director of human intel, how much weight does his word credibly deserve?\n \n Greg Thielmann, the other name mentioned in your excerpt, is mistakenly identified as an intelligence official at the State Department. At least Reuters is consistently sloppy. Rather, Thielmann was retired, making him a 'former' official at State. His comment that it \"appeared\" that intelligence had been shaped \"from the top down\" is an opinion, which he is of course entitled to offer without substance.\n \n In conclusion, your own sources help point to overwhelming evidence that the CIA and other intelligence agencies overestimated the scope and progress of Iraq's WMD programs. That doesn't absolve George Bush for his decision to engage a preemptive war, but I think no one can be entirely sure that in the absence of the overestimated threat from Iraq, that the Bush team would still have opted for imminent war.",

   "Simple fact is, after nearly a year no WMDs have been found.\nThat's not what David Kay reported to Congress last week. Kay, as you may recall, headed the Iraq Survey Group which took over the WMD search last June. The ISG's findings indicate that Iraq did retain prohibited WMD programs, but that those programs were not so extensive, advanced, or threatening as the National Intelligence Estimate maintained.\n \n To summarize the findings:\n \n Nuclear - Iraq preserved some of its technological nuclear capability from before the Gulf War, but no evidence suggested that significant steps were undertaken after 1998 toward reconstituting the program to build nuclear weapons or to produce fissile material.\n \n Chemical - Little evidence surfaced that Iraq continued to produce chemical weapons, though a small amount of clandestine research had been done. Nevertheless, Iraqi officials seemed to believe that they could convert existing civilian pharmaceutical plants to chemical-weapons production, and that Saddam was interested in their ability to do so.\n \n Biological - Iraq made determined efforts to retain a capability for biological warfare. It maintained an undeclared network of labs and other facilities within the apparatus of its security services. As Kay put it, \"this clandestine capability was suitable for preserving BW expertise, BW-capable facilities, and continuing R&D-all key elements for maintaining a capability for resuming BW production.\" To disguise its biological-warfare programs Baghdad had scientists working on overt projects that were closely related to proscribed activities.\n \n Ballistic - This is where Iraq was most aggressive. Beginning in 2000 Saddam ordered the development of ballistic missiles with ranges up to 620 miles. Measures to conceal these projects from UN inspectors were initiated in late 2002, ahead of the arrival of inspectors. The Iraqis were also working on clustering liquid-fueled rocket engines to produce a longer-range missile, and were trying to convert surface-to-air missiles into surface-to-surface missiles. Most troubling of all, the ISG uncovered evidence that from 1999 to 2002 Iraq was negotiating with North Korea to buy technology for No Dong missiles, which have a range of 800 miles.\n \n \n \nThe real question is, was the intelegence wrong,\nThat question has already been answered. Practically speaking, everyone in the intelligence community was wrong, though of course some to a lesser degree.\n \n Even the intelligence services of other nations, including those who opposed the war, were aligned with the U.S. intelligence views. The German Federal Intelligence Service argued that Iraq might be able to build a nuclear weapon within three years. French president Chirac told Time magazine last February, \"There is a problem-the probable possession of weapons of mass destruction by an uncontrollable country, Iraq. The international community is right ... in having decided Iraq should be disarmed.\" Britain, Russia, China and Israel held similar positions. In short, no one doubted Iraq had WMDs.\n \n The 'real' question should rather be: \"How is it that our intelligence could be so wrong?\"",

   "Actually, I was kidding in my earlier report. There were multiple news items on members of the intelligence community claiming that the Bush administration pressured them to provide only the intel that they wanted. Google it.\n \n I think the earliest, and possibly best indicator of whether there were WMD's left in Iraq was the responses of the UN weapons inspection team, especially inthe additional time they requested to carry out their inspections. They did not ask for another year, they did not ask for several months. They wanted 2-4 weeks to finish up. At the time, there was some flim-flamming on how much inspecting they had left to do. Depending on who you listened to, they had either completed over 90% of the inspections they wanted to do, or they had not even completed half of them. I would guess that the 90% number is closer to on key, based on the fact that requested such a short time extension.\n \n I don't believe that Iraq had WMD's. I also don't believe the XXXX that has been hitting the media lately about Saddams scientists lying to him about what they did have. I think that is the result of certain high ranking US officials trying to cover their own backsides. EITHER Saddam was a control freak, OR he was so inept in leadership that he had no idea of whether or not his key weapons programs were progressing. You can't have it both ways. Back when he was our buddy, in the days of the big gun, we know that he liked to have personal involvement in all weapons programs and that he oversaw them all personally on some level.\n \n A lot of what I have seen in the press lately, especially coming from some of the US officials, kind of sets off my BS meter. As far as pharmaceutical plants being converted to create chemical weapons, sure.....Any facility that is equipped to handle precision batch mixing of chemicals, or equipped to grow living cultures (like are used for vaccines), can be converted to create chemical or bio weapons. There has also been great fanfare made over the fact that Iraq retained quite a bit of their nuclear technilogical capability. From the handful of documents I have seen released, I have yet to see any nuke research that was recovered since the war that is not related to energy (they were only prohibited form research into weapons).\n \n I would also like to see some more info on the \"covert bio labs\" before passing judgement on those. Gator wrote:\n \n Biological - Iraq made determined efforts to retain a capability for biological warfare. It maintained an undeclared network of labs and other facilities within the apparatus of its security services.

That is a lot different from \"was being used to\" or \"was actively engaged in\". Of course, if they really WERE being used for bioweapons research, I am sure we will see on camera walkthroughs in the near future with talking heads commentating. If they were decomissioned, or re-purposed, and were not connected to bio weapons research, I am sure they have destroyed them, so all there would be to see is where the \"secret lab\" used to be. \n \n There was a walkthrough of a \"secret lab\" on MSNBC a while back that was in a prison. The reporter, obviously very excited to get this exclusive footage, was saying that they were uncertain if it was, in fact, a biological weapons research facility, or just the prisons infirmary. I only ever saw the segment once, so I am guessing it turned out to be an infirmary.\n \n I will settle for nothing less than pictures and sworn statements by experts when it comes to proof of WMD's at this point. They promised us hundreds of tons of chem/bio weapons, so far we have seen nothing conclusive.",

   "That's not what David Kay reported to Congress last week. Kay, as you may recall, headed the Iraq Survey Group which took over the WMD search last June. The ISG's findings indicate that Iraq did retain prohibited WMD programs, but that those programs were not so extensive, advanced, or threatening as the National Intelligence Estimate maintained.\n \n To summarize the findings:\n \n Nuclear - Iraq preserved some of its technological nuclear capability from before the Gulf War, but no evidence suggested that significant steps were undertaken after 1998 toward reconstituting the program to build nuclear weapons or to produce fissile material.\n \n Chemical - Little evidence surfaced that Iraq continued to produce chemical weapons, though a small amount of clandestine research had been done. Nevertheless, Iraqi officials seemed to believe that they could convert existing civilian pharmaceutical plants to chemical-weapons production, and that Saddam was interested in their ability to do so.\n \n Biological - Iraq made determined efforts to retain a capability for biological warfare. It maintained an undeclared network of labs and other facilities within the apparatus of its security services. As Kay put it, \"this clandestine capability was suitable for preserving BW expertise, BW-capable facilities, and continuing R&D-all key elements for maintaining a capability for resuming BW production.\" To disguise its biological-warfare programs Baghdad had scientists working on overt projects that were closely related to proscribed activities.\n \n Ballistic - This is where Iraq was most aggressive. Beginning in 2000 Saddam ordered the development of ballistic missiles with ranges up to 620 miles. Measures to conceal these projects from UN inspectors were initiated in late 2002, ahead of the arrival of inspectors. The Iraqis were also working on clustering liquid-fueled rocket engines to produce a longer-range missile, and were trying to convert surface-to-air missiles into surface-to-surface missiles. Most troubling of all, the ISG uncovered evidence that from 1999 to 2002 Iraq was negotiating with North Korea to buy technology for No Dong missiles, which have a range of 800 miles.\n\n \n did anyone even look at this post from Gator? if all this is accurate, judging the source it came from seems to be superior to the UN inspection, then its obvious that Saddam had no WMDs. If David Kay is truly a foremost source on the reports on Iraqi stockpiles, then we really had nothing concrete to pin on Saddam in terms of having WMDs. \n \n from the above reports, these are the highlights of Saddam's weapons programs:\n -he retained nuclear capabilities that he originally had (although he didnt use it)\n -he did a small amount of chemical weapons research\n -he made efforts to retain biological capability\n -he was negotiating to buy lomg-range ballistic weapons technology\n \n if you ask me, it seems like saddam was nothing but a failure at being a terrorist threat to the US, or any country more than 800 miles away. this is what the report says.",

   "Thank you daewoo, you stated facts, not the propoganda.\n\n \n \n Case Closed\n From the November 24, 2003 issue of the WEEKLY STANDARD: The U.S. government's secret memo detailing cooperation between Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden.\n by Stephen F. Hayes\n 11/24/2003, Volume 009, Issue 11 \n \n OSAMA BIN LADEN and Saddam Hussein had an operational relationship from the early 1990s to 2003 that involved training in explosives and weapons of mass destruction, logistical support for terrorist attacks, al Qaeda training camps and safe haven in Iraq, and Iraqi financial support for al Qaeda--perhaps even for Mohamed Atta--according to a top secret U.S. government memorandum obtained by THE WEEKLY STANDARD. \n \n The memo, dated October 27, 2003, was sent from Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas J. Feith to Senators Pat Roberts and Jay Rockefeller, the chairman and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. It was written in response to a request from the committee as part of its investigation into prewar intelligence claims made by the administration. Intelligence reporting included in the 16-page memo comes from a variety of domestic and foreign agencies, including the FBI, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the National Security Agency. Much of the evidence is detailed, conclusive, and corroborated by multiple sources. Some of it is new information obtained in custodial interviews with high-level al Qaeda terrorists and Iraqi officials, and some of it is more than a decade old. The picture that emerges is one of a history of collaboration between two of America's most determined and dangerous enemies. \n \n According to the memo--which lays out the intelligence in 50 numbered points--Iraq-al Qaeda contacts began in 1990 and continued through mid-March 2003, days before the Iraq War began. Most of the numbered passages contain straight, fact-based intelligence reporting, which in some cases includes an evaluation of the credibility of the source. This reporting is often followed by commentary and analysis. \n \n The relationship began shortly before the first Gulf War. According to reporting in the memo, bin Laden sent \"emissaries to Jordan in 1990 to meet with Iraqi government officials.\" At some unspecified point in 1991, according to a CIA analysis, \"Iraq sought Sudan's assistance to establish links to al Qaeda.\" The outreach went in both directions. According to 1993 CIA reporting cited in the memo, \"bin Laden wanted to expand his organization's capabilities through ties with Iraq.\" \n \n The primary go-between throughout these early stages was Sudanese strongman Hassan al-Turabi, a leader of the al Qaeda-affiliated National Islamic Front. Numerous sources have confirmed this. One defector reported that \"al-Turabi was instrumental in arranging the Iraqi-al Qaeda relationship. The defector said Iraq sought al Qaeda influence through its connections with Afghanistan, to facilitate the transshipment of proscribed weapons and equipment to Iraq. In return, Iraq provided al Qaeda with training and instructors.\" \n \n One such confirmation came in a postwar interview with one of Saddam Hussein's henchmen. As the memo details: \n \n 4. According to a May 2003 debriefing of a senior Iraqi intelligence officer, Iraqi intelligence established a highly secretive relationship with Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and later with al Qaeda. The first meeting in 1992 between the Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS) and al Qaeda was brokered by al-Turabi. Former IIS deputy director Faruq Hijazi and senior al Qaeda leader [Ayman al] Zawahiri were at the meeting--the first of several between 1992 and 1995 in Sudan. Additional meetings between Iraqi intelligence and al Qaeda were held in Pakistan. Members of al Qaeda would sometimes visit Baghdad where they would meet the Iraqi intelligence chief in a safe house. The report claimed that Saddam insisted the relationship with al Qaeda be kept secret. After 9-11, the source said Saddam made a personnel change in the IIS for fear the relationship would come under scrutiny from foreign probes. \n \n A decisive moment in the budding relationship came in 1993, when bin Laden faced internal resistance to his cooperation with Saddam. \n \n 5. A CIA report from a contact with good access, some of whose reporting has been corroborated, said that certain elements in the \"Islamic Army\" of bin Laden were against the secular regime of Saddam. Overriding the internal factional strife that was developing, bin Laden came to an \"understanding\" with Saddam that the Islamic Army would no longer support anti-Saddam activities. According to sensitive reporting released in U.S. court documents during the African Embassy trial, in 1993 bin Laden reached an \"understanding\" with Saddam under which he (bin Laden) forbade al Qaeda operations to be mounted against the Iraqi leader. \n \n Another facilitator of the relationship during the mid-1990s was Mahmdouh Mahmud Salim (a.k.a. Abu Hajer al-Iraqi). Abu Hajer, now in a New York prison, was described in court proceedings related to the August 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania as bin Laden's \"best friend.\" According to CIA reporting dating back to the Clinton administration, bin Laden trusted him to serve as a liaison with Saddam's regime and tasked him with procurement of weapons of mass destruction for al Qaeda. FBI reporting in the memo reveals that Abu Hajer \"visited Iraq in early 1995\" and \"had a good relationship with Iraqi intelligence. Sometime before mid-1995 he went on an al Qaeda mission to discuss unspecified cooperation with the Iraqi government.\" \n \n Some of the reporting about the relationship throughout the mid-1990s comes from a source who had intimate knowledge of bin Laden and his dealings. This source, according to CIA analysis, offered \"the most credible information\" on cooperation between bin Laden and Iraq. \n \n This source's reports read almost like a diary. Specific dates of when bin Laden flew to various cities are included, as well as names of individuals he met. The source did not offer information on the substantive talks during the meetings. . . . There are not a great many reports in general on the relationship between bin Laden and Iraq because of the secrecy surrounding it. But when this source with close access provided a \"window\" into bin Laden's activities, bin Laden is seen as heavily involved with Iraq (and Iran). \n \n \n This is an excerpt from a leaked DOD document.",

   "My opinions are based on facts, there are also plenty of leaked memos accussing syria of funding and training terrorist, hizbolla alqueda even, and theyve got WMDs, why werent they invaded?\n \n And if all is correct with what bush says, theres only one little question that remains to be answered, where are the WMDs?\n \n And maybe clinton didnt feel there was a threat from saddam, at least not to justify a war and all the carnage and killing involved. Now if as is said in the leaked memo, there was a connection between al queda and saddam, why didnt they get hold of WMDs then, and do more damage than what they did.\n\n \n My opinions are also based on fact. That is why opinions are not really arguable. Facts certainly are. Why we went after Iraq instead of syria, Iran, North Korea, etc. etc. etc., I am not certain. Iraq seemed to be a key. I note you do not respond to the Lybians, North Koreans and Iranians and Pakistan India issues. \n \n Clinton felt there was enough of a problem to bob the XXXX out of Iraq. It was not effective. Clinton was given the opportunity to Osama Bin Laden into custody and chose not too. Why? Clinton told Bush, that Bin Laden and Iraq were the two greatest threats to this country.\n \n Where are the WMD's? I am not certain. I think some of them are burried in the Iraqi desert. They burried an entire airfield of planes after all. I think many of them were sent to Syria. \n \n I think Syria is in trouble as their neighbors are not supporting them much any more. \n \n I can post much more data. We can argue the opinions if you want, but we both seem unwilling to change our mings. I had no intention of arguing what you thought of Bush. I was merely arguing something stated as fact. It was stated that \"A link between Al Queda and hussein was NEVER proven, there was NEVER and Al-Queda training camp in Iraq, and is a rediculous conclusion to draw. Al-Queda is composed of Muslim funadmentalist. They are traditionalists.\" by Daewoo. I was responding to that. I provided evidence as opposed to unsupported assertion. That was why and is why I responded. \n \n I have provided a couple of items and can get more as needed. However, you only provide assertions. Never a link. \"Never\" is very difficult if not impossible to prove. I have only to show one. I have shown two. \n \n To say things like never this or that is a head in the sand technique of arguing and provides nothing useful.",

The claim that there was \"never any evidence\" is a ludicrous one.\n \n http://www.drudgereportarchives.com/goto/?getPage=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eweeklystandard%2Ecom%2FContent%2FPublic%2FArticles%2F000%2F000%2F003%2F527uwabl%2Easp&return=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Edrudgereportarchives%2Ecom%2Fdsp%2Fsearch%2Ehtm%3FsearchFor%3Dal%2Bqaeda%2Blink\n \n \n http://www.washtimes.com/national/20031201-123723-4738r.htm\n \n The reports are from detained Iraqis and communications intercepts. According to the intelligence report, as revealed by the Weekly Standard, the letter states: \n \u0095Between 1992 and 1995, Sudanese strongman Hassan al-Turabi set up a number of meetings between former Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS) Deputy Director Faruq Hijazi and Ayman al-Zawahri, bin Laden's closest adviser. Other IIS-al Qaeda meetings occurred in Pakistan. Sometimes, al Qaeda members would visit Baghdad. \n \u0095Brig. Salim al-Ahmed, an IIS bomb maker, traveled to bin Laden's farm in Sudan and gave instructions on how to build sophisticated explosives. He was observed at the farm in the fall of 1995 and again in July 1996, the year bin Laden left Sudan and established a new base in Afghanistan. \n \u0095Mani abd-al-Rashid, IIS director, went to the farm to meet bin Laden during the same time period. \n \"The Iraqi intelligence chief and two other IIS officers met at bin Laden's farm and discussed bin Laden's request for IIS technical assistance in: a) making letter and parcel bombs; b) making bombs which could be placed on aircraft and detonated by changes in barometric pressure; and c) making false passport.\" \n Bin Laden asked that al-Ahmed, who is skilled in making car bombs, stay at the farm after al-Rashid departed. \n \u0095Al-Zawahri traveled to Baghdad in February 1998 and met with one of Iraq's vice presidents. \n \"The goal of the visit was to arrange for coordination between Iraq and bin Laden and establish camps in an-Nasiriyah and Iraqi Kurdistan under the leadership of Abdul Aziz,\" the intelligence report states. \n \u0095In late 1998, Iraq sent an intelligence official to Afghanistan to seek close ties with bin Laden and the ruling Taliban. \n \"The source reported that the Iraqi regime was trying to broaden its cooperation with al Qaeda.\" A senior Iraqi intelligence official met with the Taliban leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar. Thereafter, bin Laden hosted a series of meetings with Iraqi officials in Pakistan. \n \u0095After the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, two al Qaeda operatives traveled to Iraq for training in chemical and biological weapons. \n Much of the information in Mr. Feith's letter was compiled by a special team he assembled in 2002. Their job was to study a decade of raw and confirmed intelligence on any ties between al Qaeda and Iraq, and put it in one report. \n The team was disbanded in the fall of 2002 after the report was filed. Mr. Rumsfeld was briefed, as were other administration officials, including Mr. Tenet. \n It was at this point that Mr. Tenet, Mr. Rumsfeld and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice began making stronger, more authoritative statements on the al Qaeda-Baghdad connection. Some of their statements are reflected in the recent Feith letter to the Senate committee. \n \"This is a story that is unfolding, and it is getting clear, and we're learning more,\" Miss Rice was quoted as saying. \"We know that several of the detainees, in particular some high-ranking detainees, have said that Iraq provided some training to al Qaeda in chemical-weapons development.\" \n \n http://www.dailytelegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/04/27/walq27.xml&sSheet=/news/2003/04/27/ixnewstop.html\n \n Saturday, Dec. 13, 2003 11:08 p.m. EST \n 9/11 Bombshell: Mohamed Atta Trained in Baghdad\n http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2003/12/13/234527.shtml\n \n http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2003/12/9/25554.shtml\n \n \n Please read the info and not just attack.\n \n Good luck.",

All the \"reasons\" that bush is offering as justification for invading Iraq are all getting weaker and weaker as more \"supporting\" evidence is revealed\n\n Al qauda, probably entered iraq after the invasion, and they are as you say in pallestine and iran in far greater numbers.\n \n Alqaedas ambitions are far different from saddams, daewoo has already mentioned the reasons why, saddam was not a fundemantilist.\n \n I have to be carefull what i post as the administrator has taken a dislike to my posts, he even censored, sorry deleted a few of my posts, but i agree with you. And i think E F, just wants to debate, i dont think he is being akward.",

   "LOL, my my e_faith, Im hurt by your implications that Im not usually constructive... lol. Just because we sometimes disagree doesnt mean we are out to slander or ridicule you. \n \n anyway, like I said, and like daewoo confirmed, yes we can accept the idea that there was contact and correlations between Iraq and Al Qaeda. I can even accept that Saddam was aware of al qaeda activities both in his country and outside. however, no links that implicate Saddam in the plans or activities of the 9/11 attacks have been found, neither do they seem to even exist. furthermore, there is no evidence that Saddam was supporting, funding or contributing to the Al Qaeda movement. All these memos can assert are instances of Al Qaeda activity in Iraq (the country), not Saddam (the person)\n \n I may go so far as to say Im very sure that if bush had asked Saddam to please rid your country of Al Qaeda activities and occupation (like he asked him to rid his country of WMDs) then its very likely that Saddam would have complied (like he did before with regard to the very WMDs).\n\n \n Actually I was more directed to Daewoo than you. Additionally, the idea that one of Iraq's intelligence deputies went to meet with Al-Qaeda for the purpose of cooperation, and did it with Saddam's knowledge and not permission or did it without his knowledge is just silliness. This is a man who regularly executed people who crossed him in any way. His sons watched and reported to him. He had very loyal baathists working for him. A person this high in the government would be closely watched as to who he was meeting with. \n \n There is a definite link. You have agreed to it as far as Iraq goes. Saddam Hussein WAS Iraq. If the US were to do the same thing would people not be blaming Bush even though he may not have directed it. \n \n Come on, be reasonable. Your and Daewoo's assertions are simply without foundation.",

   "Promised info:\n \n Saddam Bombshell: Iraqi Air Force Found Buried in the Sand\n NewsMax.com ^ | Aug. 4, 2003 | Carl Limbacher\n \n \n Posted on 08/04/2003 6:49:50 AM PDT by Hugenot\n \n \n U.S. weapons inspectors have discovered \"dozens of Iraqi air force fighter jets\" buried in the sand near an airfield west of Baghdad, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. \n \n \n Inspectors stumbled upon the startling find after noticing two tail fins poking up through the sand. Beneath the telltale stabilizer wings - a completely intact Soviet built Cold war era MIG-25. \n \n \n By the time the excavation was complete, inspectors had uncovered \"30-plus\" aircraft hidden underground, a fairly sizable contingent considering that Saddam's air force was supposedly all but destroyed after the first Gulf War. \n \n \n Though major U.S. media outlets largely ignored the shocking find, the Journal noted: \n \n \n \"If it's possible to hide 30-plus aircraft for several months with 150,000 troops on the lookout, secreting vials of poison gas or anthrax has to be a cinch.\" \n \n \n Not to mention a nuclear weapon or two, we might add. \n \n \n As per its usual flatfooted performance, the Bush White House has done little to publicize their blockbuster discovery.\n \n \n It is a bit biased in the method of reporting, but I can produce others. As for WMD's, in large part the biological weapons only have to be stored appropriately in a very small amount. They can be kept for a very long time and it is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Additionally, for biological weapons one only need save the procedures. Most biological beginnings can be found clandestinely.",

   "I have been learning a lot since 911 or should I say that I had to rethink things after it.\n \n 1) Yes many countries have WMD's ... since we now discovered 3 to 5 men can convert a commercial airline into one.\n 2) Our war was declared on terrorism, not WMD's. Saddam, by anyone's definition was a terrorist ... if not to the world to his own countrymen.\n 3) America's history of supporting terrorism (which I hope is regrettable) should not, by definition, curse us to continue that behavior. \n 4) The definition of terrorism is subjective, and our moral dilemma arises as we reflect on our subjugation of our definition to others. It cannot be an excuse or a justification.\n 5) We should look to rational sources for moral judgment and realize that our religious leaders have been grossly inadequate in addressing meaningful issues, historically and currently.\n \n Most importantly, I think, is that the evolutionary notion of the survival of the fittest is the only test to sovereignty of any peoples. In today's world we have discovered the ability to economically, militarily and more recently socially (think of how the Iranian government reacts to the internet) influence if not control other \"sovereign\" countries. Pareto's law rings true on many levels and I am constantly amazed how some of these simple observations apply to the \"natural\" world that exists.\n \n American's carry the burden of their efforts, socially and economically. One has to wonder if our approach to independence isn't the greatest \"terror\" the world must face.

I proposed the real reason for the war as an oil/currency issue between the US dollar and the Euro\n \n in the light of all thei \"new evidence\" that seemingly implicates Iraq in much more terrorist activity than ever, a new delima arose: why would the UN inspections cover up this terrorist evidence in Iraq? please dont buy the excuse that the UN inspectors were incompetent/hindered from finding the evidence that was there. If Iraq had any terrorist activity, those guys knew about it. but if they knew about the real terrorist threat that Iraq posed, why would they still try to prevent the war?\n \n as WorldTraveller just mentioned, the UN board, which comprises mainly European countries, were maent to benefit largely from a recent switch of Middle East oil trade from dollars to Euros.\n \n In this war, one of these 2 scenarios is true:\n \n 1. The accusations that Bush made against Saddam is false, and the inspection reports were true\n \n 2. the exact opposite of 1\n \n now, if 1 is true, then why would Bush so stubbornly proceed to war in the face of opposing facts? why would he risk UN disapproval and insist that Saddam was a terrorist even though he was proven to be nothing more than just a tyrant leader? and why would he front this war as anti-terrorism knowing that Saddam was not a terrorist threat at all? because of oil...\n \n if 2 is true, ie, Saddam really did have WMDs, why would the UN cover up for a notorious terrorist? why would they advise America to leave at large a very real terrorist threat? why wouldnt they encourage and support the US to neutralize this threat? because of oil...\n \n I think the real case is there were doctoring of reports on both ends, as Bush tried to build a strongers case for the war, and the UN against it. \n \n http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/RRiraqWar.html\n \n this essay is a must read. it is a very detailed and extensive analysis of the macroeconomic effects of Iraq switching its oil trade standard from dollars to Euros, and the political motives behind such a move, as well as the repercussion.

Additionally, the idea that one of Iraq's intelligence deputies went to meet with Al-Qaeda for the purpose of cooperation, and did it with Saddam's knowledge and not permission or did it without his knowledge is just silliness. This is a man who regularly executed people who crossed him in any way. His sons watched and reported to him. He had very loyal baathists working for him. A person this high in the government would be closely watched as to who he was meeting with. \n \n There is a definite link. You have agreed to it as far as Iraq goes. Saddam Hussein WAS Iraq. If the US were to do the same thing would people not be blaming Bush even though he may not have directed it. \n \n Come on, be reasonable. Your and Daewoo's assertions are simply without foundation.\n\n \n \n \n First off, my assertations are built on a foundation of over 500 yrs of history between progressive muslims and muslim funadmentalist. I still recomend you look for some good books on the politics of the middle east. Even middle east politics for dummies type books should make it pretty clear that the odds of an organization such as Al Queda (stringently traditional muslim types) and a guy like saddam hussein (very progressive) is zero to none.\n \n We have no idea of the context of the purported meetings between \"High ranking Iraqi officials\" and the \"High ranking Al Queda officials\" may have been. We do know that most Al Queda operatives do it as a \"hobby\" as opposed to a full time job. We know that Iraqi intelligence officers have been known to be in contat with the Mossad.

I highly doubt it.\n \n If the contact had been between diplomatic officials and Al Queda, the link may be credible. Intel folks all over the world deal with their enimies on a regular basis. America seems to be getting quite a bit of intel on Al Queda. We are most likely getting it from Al Queda members. Does this mean America is in league with Al Queda????",

   "Here is what an Iraqi guy that I sometimes correspond with had to say about the issue:The Al-Qa'ida network was not in Iraq before the war and talk of its existence and ties between it and the Ba'th regime was only heard in Washington and London. The document that was said to have been found with the Iraqi president when he was captured in which he warns his supporters of cooperating with the Al-Qa'ida is only additional proof of the continuous US lies.\n \n \nAl-Qa'ida came to Iraq after the war, not before it, as a result of the widespread chaos that this occupation created. We would not be exaggerating if we say that US policy has fulfilled the dreams of Al-Qa'ida and its leaders in finding a safe haven in the heart of the Arab region to fight the US forces after it had lost this haven, even though it was not as important, in Afghanistan.\n \n Al-Qa'ida was \"exiled\" in Afghanistan and surrounded by a non-Arab and unfamiliar environment. It now finds itself among its own people and brothers, resisting an \"infidel\" US occupation, according to its description. Resisting occupation is legitimate in all conventions. It will definitely increase this network's popularity and support base and will create the suitable environment to recruit more supporters.\n \n The Arab nation is currently confronted with a process of \"media terrorism\" by the United States. It takes different forms starting with blackouts and ending with forgery: Forging facts and planting wrong and distorted information through a policy of flooding US and Arab satellite channels, newspapers, magazines, and radio stations, which are cloning in a terrifying manner and multiplying in a way that raises a lot of question marks.\n\n \n Of course, his thoughts on the \"terrorists\" (whihc should probably be properly called \"resistance fighters\") that are attacking coalition troops are a little different than the media had been reporting.\n \n \nEverybody in Iraq knows somebody who died during the invasion. Most of us have lost family members. We are angry, and some of us do not contain our anger well.\n",

   "E F, if there was a link, and there are/were WMDs, why didnt saddam give them to the terrorist to do as much damage as possible?\n \n Now if such a scenario existed, then you could partly justify the invasion.\n \n But with the lack of evidence to link alqaeda with saddam, sorry E.F, im not buying your leaked memo, and the non existent WMDs, this scenario seems highly unlikely, probably impossible.\n \n So if there was collabaration between saddam and alqaeda, why didnt alqaeda take any WMDs and use them?\n \n Also, bin laden is saudi, he actually fought against saddam during the first gulf war, and im sure he stated he wanted saddam out so he could establish a fundemantilist iraq along side a fundemantilist saudi, bin ladens dream clashed with what saddam stood for, i think daewoo has mentioned this before.\n \n I mean, if you were an alqaeda terorist with access to WMDs, im sure you would use them.\n\n \n I can't answer some of your questions such as why Al-qaeda doesn't have or didn't use the weapons if there was a link. The only thing I can think of is that we got to them before Iraq gave them up. However, there is still the possibility these items are in Syria. \n \n You don't have to accept the leaked memo. Look at the other evidence I posted. There is a summary of information reported in the media which included captured qaeda sources and iraqi sources. The london Independent on 10/14/01 reported that Bin Laden actually met Hussein around 1998. I don't have the article anymore, the link has moved and the london independent doesn't seem to have an archive. Look at the ISS officer that met with Qaeda operatives. \n \n Actually, Bin Laden is Sunni Muslim as is Hussein. The intercepted Al-zarqawi communication clearly shows the hatred for the Shia and the desire to foment the Shia into an uprising to attack the sunni to make governance in Iraq impossible. Qaeda only benefits from instability at this point. Once a government is in place they will have a much harder time of it. I am fairly certain he did not support against Hussein in the first gulf war. He had already been exiled from SA at that time.\n \n Your questions are good and valid though. I will do some research to see if I can give you a better response. I also appreciate your logical analysis. As opposed to no evidence or analysis. \n \n However, don't look at just the memo but rather all of it combined. That is important.",

We found and destroyed several training camps. We have provided a battle ground for terrorists far away from the USA and have been able to catch and otherwise occupy them.

   "I think too many people are assuming that Saddam ever had the ability to create large amounts of chemical or biological weapons. One of the reson that so many people thought that the inspectors were beig bamboozled is because they failed to find these massive production facilities that Iraq supposedly had. We know thye had some small scale production facilities, because we provided them and provided the techs to get them up and running. These small facilities (or what was left of them, they were bombed during gulf I since we already knew where they were) have been accounted for. \n \n We got our information regarding his WMD capabilities from dissenters who either defected or were expelled from IRaq (the same place most of the really bad horror stories come from). These were enemies of Saddam who wished to see him come ot a bad end. It seems logical that these folks would be willig to say things that they feel would lead the US to invade or take other steps to destroy saddam.\n \n Lets look at a far more likely scenario, which is that Saddam never had the facilities that the defectors claimed. Lets say, for the sake of argument, that the only production facilities he ever had were the ones we bombed during gulf I. This would explain pretty well why he didn;t have any WMDs to use during gulf II. \n \n Chemical and Biological weapons all have a shelf life. Weapons we provided back in the 80's have gone bad by now. He didn't have the facilites to replace them at anywhere near the scale we estimated. During gulf I he lost the limited production facilities he did have.\n \n If eyewitness reports are to be believed in regards to the attacks on Halabja, \"scores of planes\" dropped chemical and biological agents on the city for 2 days. If that was the case, the death toll would have been MUCH higher, unless the weapons were old (as chem and bio agents get older they loose potency). Since we can pretty much confirm the magnitude of the attack on Halabja, and the casualties were as light as they were (all things considered) we can logically deduct that he was using the original weapons that we provded to him during the war with Iran. They were old by then and had lost potency.\n \n As far as burying them or transferring him out of country, besides the near impossibility of this given our space imaging capability, it makes no sense. We said at the beginning of the war that we were going to take him from power. We tried before the war even started to assasinate him with bombs. This is a guy with nothing to loose. He knew his military was no match for the US. The use of chemical or bio weapons would have been his only real chance of actually holding us off. Yet we didn't find even one single chemical or biological weapon in the hands of his troops. We didn;t even find traces of them.\n \n Some people point at hte crates of chem/bio suits and gas masks and claim them as evidence that he did have them and planned to use them. IT seems more logical to me that he was concerned about the US using them. After all, we gave him some back when we were all buddies, and we encouraged him to use them against Iran. It owuld seem logical from his viewpoint that we would use them againt him given the chance.\n \n If you actually do apply logic to the situation and include such factors as te shelf life of these agents and what we know about the origins of the weapons that we do know for sure he had, as well as the timeline involved, it just makes it even more clear that the WMDs we used as an excuse to invade Iraq were phantoms.",

Apparently the US is incapable of keeping people from tking nuiclear reacotr parts and materials across the border, I suppose it is quite a bit to ask that they keep weapons and insurgents from coming in. \n \n This article still doesn't do anything towards proving WMDS.",

   "Iran already has functional reactors, as does israel, turkey, egypt (which only has 2 experimentals, a 20MW and a 2MW). Libya did have a productive reactor site, but israel bombed it. I am not sure about jordan, they don;t have any info up about where their power comes from.\n \n Before our invasion those materials were gaurded by the Irqis (you are talking valuable stuff there) and watched by the UN. We invaded, disbanded the army, and the UN lost their monitoring capability. The stuff ws still in Iraq prior tot he war, and was being watched. Now that we invaded, i suppose it is possible that materials could be smuggled out, before the odds were pretty slim.\n \n Also, there is a huge difference between being able to smuggle scrap materials out of a country and being able to smuggle actual WMDs.

   "So you got all of this information from... Egyptian... Egyptian TV?\n\n \n Just the bit about the two egyptian reactors. They are very proud of their nuclear program. IT was a pretty interesting show, they did a walkthrough of the reactors and had a pretty decent guy explain everything (I think he was actually indian, if I rememebr correctly).\n \n THe reactors are actually \"research\" reactors, butt hey placed them so they could be attached to the grid in areas that formerly had no power. As I understood it, they are going to try to acquire more reactors in the same size range and use them to enhance their power situation (many outlying areas in egypt still have no power). Apparently, there are dozens of smaller eactors like that which have been decomissioned and are sitting in scrap yards (according to the russians less than half of them can actually be accounted for). I guess they can be picked up fro next to nothing now.\n \n What's wrong with getting info from an egyptian TV station? IT would seem that if you want info on what is going on in egypt, that would be the first place to look. I think that it was even on Al-Mehwar, which is privatly owned (as opposed to nile TV, which is a government run station).",
