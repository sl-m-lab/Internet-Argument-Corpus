They argue that Matt's killers probably didn't read their anti-gay press releases, so it's unfair to say that their vocal bigotry led to violence.\n \n But the simple fact remains that religious extremists vilify gays on a regular basis, creating and feeding a culture that inadvertently gives comfort to those who choose to express their hate in violence. The religious right calls gays diseased, perverted, immoral, and abomination. They say on TV and radio that gays deserve to lose their jobs, their children, their families and their homes. They prepare studies for Congress \"proving\" gays are unfit teachers, parents, ambassadors, and soldiers. They liken gays to pedophiles, adulterers, murderers, kleptomaniacs, and alcoholics. And they accuse gays of being anti-family, anti-Christian, anti-America, and anti-God.\n \n It is simply not possible to constantly preach the inhumanity of man, then blithely skulk away when principle meets practice. It is simply not moral to give a child a gun, then feign ignorance when someone gets hurt.\n \n If words do not inspire actions, then why did the top religious right organizations spend $500,000 on an ad campaign to inspire gays to 'convert'?  They know words have consequences, and their words are nothing less than the subjugation and dehumanization of gay and lesbian Americans. While most on the far-right don't preach violence, it is no wonder that decades of their disdain eventually led to murder. \n \n Now's your chance to say \"enough!\" Click on the links below to automatically email local and national newspapers and magazines.

Oh, the horror!\n \n LOL\n\n \n \n NO, cited by studies on the assailants of gate crimes...Religion is high on the list...number 1......lets look at the assailants of anti-gay crimes...\n \n The bulk of studies have sought to uncover the correlates of negative attitudes. Some findings are contradictory, such as the relationship between sex-role conformity (i.e., masculinity, femininity, androgyny) and attitudes. In general, however, some consistent patterns have been observed across different samples. When compared to those with more favorable attitudes toward lesbians and gay men, these studies have found that persons with negative attitudes:\n \n 1. are less likely to have had personal contact with lesbians or gay;\n \n 2. are less likely to report having engaged in homosexual behaviors, or to identify themselves as lesbian or gay;\n \n 3. are more likely to perceive their peers as manifesting negative attitudes, especially if the respondents are males;\n \n 4. are more likely to have resided in areas where negative attitudes are the norm (e.g., the midwestern and southern United States, the Canadian prairies, and in rural areas or small towns), especially during adolescence;\n \n 5. are likely to be older and less well educated;\n \n  6. are more likely to be religious, to attend church frequently, and to subscribe to a conservative religious ideology;\n \n 7. are more likely to express traditional, restrictive attitudes about sex roles;\n \n 8. are less permissive sexually or manifest more guilt or negativity about sexuality, although some researchers have not observed this pattern and others have reported a substantially reduced correlation with the effects of sex-role attitudes partialled out;\n \n 9. are more likely to manifest high levels of authoritarianism and related personality characteristics.\n \n Sex differences in the direction and intensity of attitudes have been observed fairly consistently. It appears that heterosexuals tend to have more negative attitudes toward homosexuals of their own sex than of the opposite sex. . . .\n \n \n Most common stereotypes are related to cross-sex characteristics. Additionally, significant numbers of individuals characterize male homosexuals as mentally ill, promiscuous, lonely, insecure, and likely to be child molesters, while lesbians have been described as aggressive and hostile toward men. Positive characteristics are also part of the homosexual stereotype including such traits as sensitivity, intelligence, honesty, imagination, and neatness.\n (gee, where would people get the idea that gays are mentally ill? Religion perhaps? Stephen Bennett, Focus on Family, Falwell?)\n \n \n For persons with symbolic attitudes, certain reference groups appear to be particularly influential. As already mentioned, people who are involved in church groups (as indicated by frequent attendance at church services) reflect the historical religious bias against lesbians and gay men, and this is especially so for Christians. People who grew up in areas where higher tolerance exists for diversity also hold more positive attitudes toward lesbians and gay men; these include city-dwellers and people from the northeastern and Pacific coastal regions of the United States The same studies report that more tolerant attitudes are held by younger persons (whose cohorts' values reflect the liberalism of the 1960s and 1970s) and by persons with more education (who presumably have been exposed to liberal values on a college campus). Finally, people are more tolerant of lesbians and gay men if their parents also displayed tolerance. \n \n http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/roots/overview.html\n \n \"Many of these people are influenced by Bible passages that they perceive to give them complete license to murder gays because it's a sin, and that's how the twisted minds of these people work,\" said Brian Levin, director of the Center on Hate and Extremism, a California group.\n \n And the ability of hate groups to influence people like Matthew Williams rests solely on getting their message out and hoping it sticks to someone.\n http://www.salon.com/news/feature/1999/11/08/hate/print.html\n \n But the killers most certainly had a lifelong exposure to society's messages about how men and women should behave and how homosexuals should be regarded. They may have believed that no one would mind the loss of another homosexual. Like other perpetrators of anti-gay attacks, they may have felt that they were righteously enforcing God's and society's rules, administering \"justice.\"\n http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/shepard.html\n \n A videotape of a Jerry Falwell television show available in Canada states, referring to the gay and lesbian March on Washington in 1993, \"I mean, it would have been hard not to use napalm. You [referring to gay men and lesbians] send for my children. You want to sodomize and rape them and destroy them.\"[98] Roseanne Skoke, then-Canadian Member of Parliament stated in Parliament that \"homosexuality is based on an inhuman act, defiles humanity, destroys families...and is annihilating mankind.\"[99] Gay men and lesbians are often portrayed as living \"an incomplete and sordid lifestyle, totally absorbed by illicit sex\".[100] Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome is frequently cited as a form of deserved retribution for the \"sin against nature\" of \"the destructive lifestyle\"[101] of homosexuality. The link between homosexuality and crime is a common one:\n \n Homosexuals are so depraved, so out of the will of God, that no act of lawlessness is beyond them!...The constant , willful [sic] practising of degrading, Godless acts of perversion has got to have an anesthetizing effect on the homosexual - until no laws mean anything.[102] \n http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v6n2/banks62_text.html#rationales_b",

If you had said \"fundamentalism\" or the extreme examples of religion were a cause, then I'd have agreed with you from the get-go. But you never say that, and still haven't. You insist on not making the distiction, no doubt because it makes a better attack against religion to irrationally generalize. So you are still wrong. And so is the \"study\" by the way, since it didn't make the distinction either. Heck, Joe, you're smarter than this. You should know better considering that some Christian religious groups are friendly toward gays. I would think that fact alone would lead you to not make such generalizations. For that matter, even the word \"evangelicalism\" as a cause is too much of a generalization, because there are evangelical groups that do not say a word against gay people.\n \n To say \"religion\" is the cause of violence in these cases rather than fundamentalism is like blaming everyone that owns a car for a hit-and-run homicide by a drunk driver. It's like saying \"car-ownership\" or \"driving\" is the culprit instead of the driver who drove drunk who actually commited the crime.\n\n \n \n Your right is it not religion per say, but it is the James Dobsen, Stephen Bennetts, Exodus International, NARTH, Concerned women for America, just to name a few.....what do you call those people?

There may be some Christian groups (non-fundie) that do feel homosexual behavior is immoral but they don't try to impose anything or put their beliefs into political action.

It doesn't make any difference to me if you want to slap some new label on these people; the observation still remains true.",

   "If this is the case then you should understand which christians we are talking about in this discussion and which we are not. I think you are trying to divert the issue. For the larger part we are talking about \"christian\" groups such as repent america, Focus on the family, including James Dobsen and his hate messages....Stephen Bennett, Concerned women for America, Jerry Falwell (who has over 80 million followers), the list goes on and on.....\n\n \n Then make yourself clear! When you use a general term like \"Christian\" you are doing the same thing as people who use the general term \"gays\" to describe something that only some of them are doing.\n \n \nStop trying to could the issue when in the context of the conversation you know exactly who we are talking about.\n\n \n I just don't think it's too much to ask for you to use accurate language that doesn't generalize.\n \n \nNo one says that all Christians hate gays, that's simply your overactive imagination inventing persecution that doesn't exist. I do say that many people hate gays, many of them are Christian, and many of those use their religion to justify their hatred. Many,many more people are antigonistic towards gays, and many of them also justify their feelings with their religion. These are simple statements of fact. \n\n \n But those are the fundamentalist sects, or fundamentalist Christians that do that. I don't think you realize how diverse Christianity is. Much, no I'd say, MOST of Christianity isn't that concerned with the issue of homosexuality.",

Now you're talking about homophobia. You're all over the place on this. My reponse was that oppression against gays is from fundamentalism, and I stand by my comments. When anyone oppresses gays in the name of religion, they are being fundamentalist in the sense that they are excercising an extreme form of the religion.
