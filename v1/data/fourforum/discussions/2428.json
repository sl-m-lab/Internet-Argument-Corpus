Taking the gun ownership argument to it's philosophical points, conservatives usually say that the gov't has no business being intrusive on our lives. That is the liberal position in regards to abortion, that pregnancy is one of the most personal of issues and that the gov't should have no involvment in it. It goes the other way too. The point of the poll is to see if the pro/anti gun control crowd lines up with the pro-life and pro-choice crowd. So far the pro-choice crowd is split, but there have been very few votes.
