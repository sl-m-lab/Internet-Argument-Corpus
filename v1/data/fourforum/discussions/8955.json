   "Hezbollah must disarm\n \n \n The international community is doing its best to get us out of the terrorist era grab of the Syrian regime, while the Hezbollah and Amal still demonstrating their support to the evil of illegal arms, to the outlaws, and war criminals under the law of terrorist nations. It is a corruption in Beirut and in the other cities where they are based. We cannot wait until they smash the nation on our heads; this is the Syrian confirmed threat against Lebanese. Ordinary Phoenicians hike you will open up their homes to their friends and neighbors for a night of planning and action-our national organizing kickoff, and you can get started right away. Every one of us need to take responsibility for the Phoenician organization in our neighborhoods, and this is everyone's opportunity to come together and focus we have to be organized to get our message out we need a network in place now to persuade volunteers and activate our supporters. It's up to you to make sure that everyone in your neighborhood is plugged in and ready to do as much as they can. To make an impact everywhere we need to organize everywhere. That's what you mandated, and that's why our party has taken the unprecedented step putting organizers on the ground and building international parties across the world to fight terrorism across the land of the cedars and kick them out forever. The event you will host will bring everyone up to speed on our progress, our opportunities and the work ahead. Every one must commit to working on the project, and the meeting you host will help create the road map for a year of sustained commitment until them. As Phoenician leaders are investigating and indicted, Phoenicians everywhere are tired ofpolitics as usual. The culture of corruption that Hezbollah and Amal including their allies have brought to Lebanon, Beirut across the country is making more and more people realize that we need change. Hosting a local organizing kick off meeting is the most important step you can take right now to make sure that our party is in a position to change things next coming days. \n \n Thank you, \n \n United Phoenician Party \n www.unitedphoenicianparty.org",
