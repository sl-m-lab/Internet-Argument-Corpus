Also, I believe that in a number of other states, state officials try to show up for the funerals of those who have been killed in combat.\n \n What are the exact circumstances of this little brouhaha? Did Knoll walk in with a campaign sign and hand out pamphlets as she went to her seat? Has she been to other funerals for combat victims? Did she make campaign speeches at these funerals?",

   "Obviously we live in different coutries. Most funerals in the U.S. are open to anyone who happens by, unless special arrangements have been made.\n \n As a matter of fact, I crashed a funeral of a noted architect and designer because his funeral was being held in a church he had had a hand in designing. Loved the design of the church, a few looked askance at me as I dug into the posh grub afterwards but I, unblushingly, said something about liking his work as an architect and dug in.\n \n Also, although a rabid non-Catholic I have attended the funerals of a nun I admired, a bishop I did not admire so much--I skipped the after funeral social gathering.\n \n If I should choose to attend the funeral of a local person who died in combat in Iraq, I am very sure that I would be welcome to do so, unless the church were already crowded. And, again, a great many state officials IN THE UNITED STATES have felt that it was their duty to be present at funeral services for state residents who had been killed in combat. Those who go in an official capacity to these services go to honor the memory of the deceased.\n \n In instances where the funeral is private, I believe that that is usually announced in the obituary and I would certainly think that persons would be stationed at the doors to the services to turn away those who were not invited. Was that the case in this particular funeral?",
