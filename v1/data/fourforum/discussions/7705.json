The people decide for themselves what choices they want to be able to exercise...what kinda of government do you think we have? Dicator vs. people? Do our elections mean nothing?\n \n \n\n They have a choice not to have an abortion. Personal choice, personal responsibility.\n But they don't have a choice to ban a procedure they don't like. Once again, the people elect people to apply rules to run their society. Your idea would be like saying you should have the personal choice to murder someone or not. That just isn't how our government works..we are allowed to ban procedures if we want. We ban smoking weed for example, thats perfectly ok with our constitution. \n \n \nThis is an old argument, hardly worth answering. Speeding endangers others on the road. If it did not affect others on the road, then people should indeed have the right to speed. The courts can and do indeed say when the legislatures are out of line.\n Based on what? Their own personal beliefs! Is banning smoking weed unconstitutional? No, that is crazy. That aside, who is to say you aren't harming another person in an abortion...I think you are. \n \n \n The point is, our government is set up to have the federal government hold some powers...one of those is not abortion...thus left to the states to decide. This gives people the option to ban abortion in their state...they have the right to deny themselves some powers by electing people to represent. South Dakota did this. By judges saying \"no\" you actually tell people they can't govern themselves which goes against the very founding of this country.",

   "I did not say it did. I said that SCOTUS can strike down State laws that violate constitutional rights in response to you saying that States can do what they wish regarding abortion. Obviously they cannot if a woman has a constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy.\n\n \n I said that the South Dakota law gives the Supreme Court the chance to reverse its unprincipled decision in Roe, and in response you said \"It also allows SCOTUS to strike down State laws that violate constitutional rights.\" Were you not referring to the South Dakota law here?

I said that SCOTUS can strike down State laws that violate constitutional rights in response to you saying that States can do what they wish regarding abortion.

As I previously said, even if the Constitution protects the right to abortion (which it does not), it does not necessarily protect the right of a third party to aid someone in carrying the abortion out. However, when I say that a state may regulate abortion however they wish, I implicitly say exactly what I mean to say: that abortion is not a constitutional right for anybody - women or doctors.\n \n \nOne would indeed think what I said was obvious. However, what Cone said was as obviously incorrect so such an obvious statement was needed to counteract it.\n\n What I said would only be incorrect if abortion was a constitutional right. It of course is not, and thus my statement was correct.\n \n Incidentally, your statement that the Supreme Court can strike down laws that violate constitutional rights was correct as well. But, if you were implying in that statement that abortion is a constitutional right, you would of course be wrong.\n \n \nOh Steve. Steve Steve Steve. Abortion obviously has been a Constitution issue for many years now. It obviously has been considered a Constitutional right for a woman to have the freedom to acquire one. Whether you agree with that or not, that is the truth in practice. Therefore, obviously, States cannot \"do what they wish\" regarding abortion.\n\n It may have been considered a constitutional right. However, this does not mean that it really is one. Also, South Dakota has just proved that a state may do whatever it wishes regarding abortion.\n \n \nI doubt Cone needs, wants or appreciates your help.\n\n Hey, I don't mind anyone's contribution.\n \n \n Then you are of the opinion that any freedoms that are not enumerated in the Constitution the people do not have?\n\n I agree with steeeeve's response to this.\n \n \nWow, you have such a perverted view of freedom. 'Tis freedom when the people have the choice, not the legislature. Those 6 of 9 made gave the people the choice by restricting the legislature. I am content with more choice for private citizens and less for the lawmakers.\n\n Agree with steeeeve on this also.\n \n \nSo any freedom the Constitution does not specifically mention belongs to the people the Constitution does not protect? Contraceptives, for instance? People do not have a Constitutional freedom to obtain them, over the State's objections?\n\n People have the freedom to obtain contraceptives unless of course a State removes that freedom. Thus I generally agree with steeeeve here as well.\n \n \nI see. So there is Constitutional support for the people having the right to obtain and use contraceptives despite the desire of the State and regardless of whether it is explicitly stated in the Constitution? Is that what you are saying?\n\n I'll take a stab at what steeeve means by this. Even if it's not what he means, though, it is what I mean.\n \n Because the constitution does not protect the right to obtain and use contraceptives, the State may regulate that however they wish. Thus, it is possible that the people in one state would have the right to obtain and use contraceptives (because they were given that right by the legislature), and it is possible that the people in another state would not have the right to obtain and use contraceptives (because their legislature prohibited it).\n \n I didn't respond to most of the final things you directed at steeeve because my posts would be too long.",

I can't imagine all judges thinking like this. Laws don't really matter so long as the judge gets to decide what words mean.

   "Cone. You said that States may do what they wish regarding abortion. This is false.\n\n I think we may be misunderstanding one another here. It seems to me that you are making an argument about the practicality of abortion legislation that runs along the following lines (please correct me if I'm wrong):\n \n The Supreme Court has affirmed that the right to an abortion is protected by the Constitution. Therefore, any law that would violate the Supreme Court's decision would not be able to be enforced. Thus, the states may not do as they wish regarding abortion. I agree with this. Any regulation a state tries to make regarding abortion that does not line up with Supreme Court established standards will be enjoined by lower courts.\n \n However, this is not what I'm getting at when I say that \"a state may do as it wishes regarding abortion.\" I am saying that from a theoretical standpoint, that is, that there is nothing in the Constitution that prevents a state from legislating however they wish regarding abortion. Thus, I am taking it back a step from simply the practicality. I am saying that the theory that established the standard prohibiting states from legislating around abortion however they wish was wrong. Perhaps my statement would better be understood if I said it the following way: The states ought to be able to do as they wish regarding abortion. And by ought, I don't mean that that is simply the way I would prefer it. By ought I mean that it is the only legitimate conclusion the Supreme Court could come to.\n \n So in short, I would state my position this way: Because states may not enforce laws that violate Supreme Court decisions, the states practically may not do as they wish regarding abortion. But, because the Supreme Court's standard regarding abortion is illegitimate, and there is nothing in the Constitution that prohibits them from regulating abortion however they wish, they really ought to be able to regulate abortion however they wish. \n \n \nRight. The two cannot reasonably be separate, as you seemed to assert.\n\n I disagree. It is clear that they can be reaonably separate. For instance, one may say that \"A woman has a right to terminate her pregnancy.\" Ok, so she may. But that is a different claim from this one: \"A woman has a right to be aided in terminating her pregnancy.\" This distinction is as clear as the following one. \"X has the right to publish Y\" is not the same as \"X has the right to have Y published by Z.\"\n \n \nCone, assuming your premise is true when that has not been established is a dishonest debating tactic. Especially since it is patently false in practice.\n\n I think it obvious that the Constituiton says nothing about abortion. I will, however, be happy to defend this claim in a formal debate if you like.\n \n \nThe majority of people don't appear to believe this happened in Roe, then, because the majority of people don't believe Roe should be overturned.\n\n The majority of people don't have a clue about what happened in Roe. It is obvious that the Supreme Court established the right to abortion in that case.\n \n \nI'm sorry, allowing 51% of the population in a certain State to disallow the other 49% to use contraceptive is not what I, or what the vast majority of people imo, would consider a free society.\n\n This is an inherent contradiction. If the vast majority of people would object to disallowing the use of contraceptives, then they are the majority and are able to codify their desire.",

And by ought, I don't mean that that is simply the way I would prefer it. By ought I mean that it is the only legitimate conclusion the Supreme Court could come to.\n\n \n Your stance is indeed better understood this way. However, in either senses of ought here, it is opinion. And I obviously disagree.\n \n \nI disagree. It is clear that they can be reaonably separate. For instance, one may say that \"A woman has a right to terminate her pregnancy.\"\n\n \n That is not the right in question. She has the freedom to seek one. This was further clarified in Casey when it was ruled that a State could not create an \"undue burden\" on the woman's ability to seek and obtain an abortion.\n \n It would seem you are being contradictory. On one hand they necessitate each other to face the abortion question head on (it could not do this if they could reasonably be upheld separately), and on the other you wish to claim they are separate. No reasonable person could claim that a woman has the right to seek an abortion but it is illegal to perform one. That is and would be nonsensical. \n \n \nI think it obvious that the Constituiton says nothing about abortion.

So, what you believe about what the majority of people may think about a subject is true, while the statistics about what the majority of people do think are dismissed. Interesting.\n \n \nThis is an inherent contradiction. If the vast majority of people would object to disallowing the use of contraceptives, then they are the majority and are able to codify their desire.\n\n \n Certainly, if they can get enough States to ratify an Amendment. Otherwise, it can be considered a fundamental freedom that is protected from infringement without a compelling interest on the part of the State. Of course, if this country regresses to the point of doing this I hope to either be long dead or living somewhere else.",

   "I am going to try and slim down the posts a little...\n \n \nOh, it's been around longer than that, Steve, even if the phrase \"substantive due process\" did not appear. At the very least it was used in the Dred Scott decision in the mid 19th century, and its roots appear even earlier.\n Dred Scott was decided based on nothing, not substantive due process or even a form of it. In fact, the 14th amendment (which is the only due process clause thought to have a substantive component) wasn't even around then.\n \n \nSir Edward Coke and Sir William Blackstone were both jurists and legal scholars in the 18th century who agreed that regulatory laws must substantially advance the purpose for which the government had imposed them.\n English jurists..you should probably add that part. They, however, didn't write the 14th amendment nor does it matter what Blackstones thoughts on it would have been.\n \n If you want to go by \"intent\" of the people that wrote it then read some of the early verisons of the amendment. Most of them didn't include \"due process\" which was also referred to as \"due course\"(which Blackstone used as well). During the debates it was talked about as a procedural guarntee and it was only added for the ending of the debate. \n \n \nSubstantive Due Process protects the minority.\n Actually, it doesn't. It either 1) reflects the views of the majority or 2) reflects the views of a single person (which can either help or hurt the minority). In the age of the living constitution (which is what substantive due process created by the way) a decision by the court on what something means today would have to be looked at through the eyes of the majority if you use this standard. You would have to say \"what does liberty mean...well, it means what society wants it to mean...which is the majority\". Either that or a judge would be like \"hey, I think abortion is wrong...it must be against liberty\". Either way, you might hurt the minority...such as the Kelo case or in some \"due process\" cases regarding people accused on crimes. Don't for a minute think that substantive due process will only help the minority...as Scalia puts it, \"that isn't the name of the game\".\n \n \n\n Agreed, neither does doing something for the first 150-200 years make something right either.\n \n If you disagree with the concept of substantive due process, you disagree with more than 50 years of decisions.\n Surely in the first couple of years the framers would see whether or not the government was working the way intended...it seems that since it was accepted for the first 150-200 years then that has more backing.\n \n \nI believe they get to interpret what is in the Constitution. That is not making laws.\n Sure it is. If they interpret that making laws against smoking weed is in the constitution then they made a law against government making laws to promote smoking weed. In a sense, it is a ban on governing. Or by saying \"you have to provide an attorney and pay for it\" you created a law oh what the state must do; they don't get to interpret what is IN the constitution...the get to interpret the constitution. You make it seem like the decide what is in or out...that is already set in stone, it is a legal document. A contract to sell a car doesn't have things implied in it like \"it should come with that new car smell\"...that would be crazy.\n \n \nNot so; limiting how much legislatures may limit liberty does not make legislatures useless.\n Sure it does. Everytime you didn't like something you could just say \"not included in liberty\"...you make the Supreme Court the most powerful of all the branches and unchecked....this was obviously not the intent of the framers nor the practice of the courts(for 150 years).\n \n \nYour hyperbole is getting very tiresome.

It really just comes down to it being based on the judges own personal views...do you not agree?\n \n \n\n If the Judges decided States were justified in infringing upon a woman's rights by restricting abortion I would have to live with it as long as it took to change that.\n So in a sense, we have no idea what the constitution says...it all depends on the 9 people up there at any given moment. It literally is the only legal document that changes depending on who looks it. I can't imagine that happening with my lease for my apartment. The meaning could change any time. wow.\n \n \nSeriously, if you can't take the time to actually understand the opposing side don't bother. It's hardly worth discussing anything with you.\n It is your only logical conclusion! Why would you not get the judges up there that have your viewpoint!!

You and I have come to different conclusions, but that does not mean that one of our conclusions is not right (indeed, one of them must be right because there are only two possibilities).\n \n Now, some groundwork would have to be laid, but it can be shown that the only legitimate decision the Supreme Court could come to is that the Constitution does not protect abortion.\n \n \nThat is not the right in question. She has the freedom to seek one. This was further clarified in Casey when it was ruled that a State could not create an \"undue burden\" on the woman's ability to seek and obtain an abortion.\n\n Ok, supposing she had the freedom (constitutional right) to seek one, it still does not follow that she has a constitutional right to have someone else aid her in terminating her pregnancy. Otherwise, the state would have to force doctors to provide abortions in the event that no doctors would want to do so voluntarily.\n \n Again, it's akin to the following: to say that \"X has the right to publish Y\" is not the same as saying \"X has a right to have Y published by Z.\"\n \n \nIt would seem you are being contradictory. On one hand they necessitate each other to face the abortion question head on (it could not do this if they could reasonably be upheld separately), and on the other you wish to claim they are separate. No reasonable person could claim that a woman has the right to seek an abortion but it is illegal to perform one. That is and would be nonsensical.\n \n I don't believe I have said this. I said that the South Dakota ban seems to be intended to challenge the Court's decision that abortion is a right protected by the Constitution.\n \n But I also think from a theoretical standpoint, that if Roe didn't exist it would not be far fetched to hear the argument that even if a woman had the constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy, it does not follow that she has the constitutional right to have the aid of a third party to do so.\n \n \nI have not claimed it has.\n\n Have you not claimed that the Constituiton protects the right to an abortion?\n \n \nThen why claim anything about what the majority of people think, when the majority of people don't have a clue about what is happening? So, what you believe about what the majority of people may think about a subject is true, while the statistics about what the majority of people do think are dismissed. Interesting.\n\n I referred to majorities because you did. It seems to have some sort of weight with you because you always refer to it.\n \n For instance, you first asserted that my view about the Constitution and contraception was somehow outside what the \"vast majority of civilized society\" thinks.\n \n I responded by saying that the vast majority of people in the United States do not believe that the Supreme Court should invent new rights.\n \n You respond by saying that since most people don't want Roe overruled, then the vast majority must not believe that a new Constitutional Right was invented in Roe.\n \n I can't accept your conclusion, and here's why. One does not need the majority's input when deciding whether a new constitutional right was created in Roe. It clearly happened in that case. That aside, as I'm sure you know, majorities are not always logically consistent. Thus it is possible to have the majority of people support the claim that judges should not create new constitutional rights while at the same time supporting the affirmation of a case which does just that.\n \n Hence, I'm sure I'm right when I say that a majority of people in the United States do not believe judges should create new rights. I am also sure that a majority of people do not want Roe overruled (for whatever reason). However, it doesn't follow from those two positions, that the majority of people must not think that Roe created a new Constitutional right. And indeed, I haven't seen any polls that have asked that question.\n \n \nCertainly, if they can get enough States to ratify an Amendment. Otherwise, it can be considered a fundamental freedom that is protected from infringement without a compelling interest on the part of the State. Of course, if this country regresses to the point of doing this I hope to either be long dead or living somewhere else.\n\n You only would need an amendment if you wanted contraception to be a constitutional right. However, one does not need to protection of the Constitution. It would suffice to 1) have a state statute protect the use/sale of contraception, or 2) have the Congress enact a statute that protects the use/sale of contraception. You can do both of these with simple majorities.\n \n You seem to be saying the the constitution protects all those rights which it does not explicitly forbid. Is this right?",

   "Dred Scott was decided based on nothing, not substantive due process or even a form of it. In fact, the 14th amendment (which is the only due process clause thought to have a substantive component) wasn't even around then.\n\n \n 'Twas indeed based on a from of it. The Missouri Compromise was struck down because an \"act of Congress that deprived a citizen of his liberty or property merely because he came himself or brought his property into a particular territory of the United States, and who had committed no offence against the laws, could hardly be dignified with the name of due process of law\".\n \n Though the phrase was not present, the concept is. \n \n The Fifth also has a substantive component with it's association with \"due compensation\".\n \n \nEnglish jurists..you should probably add that part. They, however, didn't write the 14th amendment nor does it matter what Blackstones thoughts on it would have been.\n\n \n We were speaking of common law, so I didn't think that was necessary. \n \n Blackstones thoughts wouldn't matter? Yet his words were quoted during debates on civil rights during the time the phrasing of the 14th was being considered. Wilson, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, referred to Blackstones principles as \"the great fundamental civil rights\". The language of the Civil Rights Bill, which was heavily influenced by Blackstone, was used to formulate similar language in the 14th. \n \n \nIf you want to go by \"intent\" of the people that wrote it then read some of the early verisons of the amendment. Most of them didn't include \"due process\" which was also referred to as \"due course\"(which Blackstone used as well). During the debates it was talked about as a procedural guarntee and it was only added for the ending of the debate.\n\n \n Keep in mind, however, that intent cannot be blindly gone by. Incorporation itself goes against the intent of the framers, and Incorporation of the amendments against the States was part of the intent of the 14th.\n \n I have read some of their words when they were considering the language of the 14th. \"Liberty\" was indeed intended, from what I've seen, to include the Ninth amendment, which includes unenumerated rights against the States.\n \n \nActually, it doesn't. It either 1) reflects the views of the majority or 2) reflects the views of a single person (which can either help or hurt the minority).\n\n \n I misspoke then. It does not always help a certain group, but it does allow the will of the majority to be resisted to the benefit of the minority.\n \n \n Either that or a judge would be like \"hey, I think abortion is wrong...it must be against liberty\". Either way, you might hurt the minority...such as the Kelo case or in some \"due process\" cases regarding people accused on crimes. Don't for a minute think that substantive due process will only help the minority...as Scalia puts it, \"that isn't the name of the game\".\n\n \n Every restriction limits liberty, Steve, and liberty is a guaranteed right of the Constitution. Yes, liberty can be legally limited by procedural due process, but that does not negate that laws limit liberty. I do agree that the Fourteenth created what we have today, with both Incorporation and Substantive Due Process being an outgrowth.\n \n Given that liberty is a guaranteed right and it is not specified exactly what is covered by that word, striking down laws that limit certain liberties is a valid power, imo. Yes, it is at the discretion of the Judges which rights are \"fundamental\", as it is at the judges discretion what \"cruel and unusual\" means and what \"reasonable\" means. Precedence plays a large part in this, from what I've seen.\n \n \nSurely in the first couple of years the framers would see whether or not the government was working the way intended...it seems that since it was accepted for the first 150-200 years then that has more backing.\n\n \n No, I don't think so. Different times, different technologies, different issues. What would work then won't necessarily work now. What was accepted then doesn't have more backing, imo.\n \n \nSure it is. If they interpret that making laws against smoking weed is in the constitution then they made a law against government making laws to promote smoking weed.\n\n \n Striking down a law is not \"making a law against gov't making law\". \n \n \nIn a sense, it is a ban on governing.\n\n \n Which is still not law\n \n \nOr by saying \"you have to provide an attorney and pay for it\" you created a law oh what the state must do; they don't get to interpret what is IN the constitution...the get to interpret the constitution.\n\n \n In this case, it is pretty cut and dry. Each defendant must have an attorney. I don't see how you can wiggle out of that, unless attorneys are required to provide free services. That would be fine with me too. However, Congress should have enforced this upon the States, not SCOTUS.\n \n \nYou make it seem like the decide what is in or out...that is already set in stone, it is a legal document. A contract to sell a car doesn't have things implied in it like \"it should come with that new car smell\"...that would be crazy.\n\n \n Poor analogies, Steve.\n \n \nSure it does. Everytime you didn't like something you could just say \"not included in liberty\"...you make the Supreme Court the most powerful of all the branches and unchecked....this was obviously not the intent of the framers nor the practice of the courts(for 150 years).\n\n \n In the area of judging law? Yes, though certainly not \"unchecked\"\n \n \nbased on what?\n\n \n Based on the right in question. Liberty is guaranteed by the Constitution, so if the law infringes upon that the judges decide if the State is justified in doing so with that right.\n \n In this way Substantive Due Process is protective of rights, since they can only agree or disagree with the State's imposition upon the citizens.\n \n \n The meaning could change any time. wow.\n\n \n Then don't sign a lease that says the landlord will take \"due compensation\" for you living there, will not raise the rates to \"cruel and unusual\" heights, and will fix things in a \"reasonable\" amount of time. Otherwise it will be different to each person who reads it. Wow, Steve. What a concept.\n \n \nIf the judges get to decide what \"liberty\" is based on their own views then I want someone up there with my own views just like you do. This is the very thing the federalists say won't happen.\n\n \n Ok. Say you did. Say there was a judge who believed in Substantive Due Process and agreed with your views. Give me the worst case scenario of your views.\n \n \nattempt failed\n\n \n pfft.",

The discussion was when did \"subsantive due process\" started...You might be right in saying it was first seen in Dred Scott (and Scalia actually believes this) but it surely didn't become popular for another 50+ years. I assume you aren't trying to argue the Dred Scott was a correct decision are you?\n \n \nWe were speaking of common law, so I didn't think that was necessary.\n \n Blackstones thoughts wouldn't matter? Yet his words were quoted during debates on civil rights during the time the phrasing of the 14th was being considered. Wilson, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, referred to Blackstones principles as \"the great fundamental civil rights\". The language of the Civil Rights Bill, which was heavily influenced by Blackstone, was used to formulate similar language in the 14th.\n I didn't take you for one to look at judicial history for meaning...however, words of Blackstone were used in debating the Civil Rights Bill like you said (a vetoed bill I might add)...but thi s doesn't mean everything he said was gold and applied to the 14th amendment. In fact, the during the debates of the 14th amendment nothing was said about Blackstone's views on a substantive type component. Furthermore there was nothing to suggest the judges were to determine these \"great fundamental civil rights\" even if that was the intent of the amendment (which it wasn't). Like I said, the early looks at the 14th amendment didn't even have \"due process of law\". It was only added as a procedural thing....blackstones arguments were used long before \"due process of law\" was even added.\n \n \nIncorporation itself goes against the intent of the framers, and Incorporation of the amendments against the States was part of the intent of the 14th.\n This is also pretty debatable. I'd rather not get into this but here is a good read on it http://www.constitutionalfreedomfoundation.org/Articles/14th_amendment.htm\n \n I tend to agree with Scalia though that you can't really \"undo\" that one.\n \n \n\n Given that liberty is a guaranteed right and it is not specified exactly what is covered by that word, striking down laws that limit certain liberties is a valid power, imo.\n The meaning of the word liberty is of no matter. It means almost everything. The key phrase is that it can be taken away with due process of law. You can have your property taken away, you can have your life taken away, and you can have your liberty taken away(jailed). My point was (and I might have not been clear earlier) that liberty is not defined by a judge just like property isn't. I can't imagine a judge telling me that my cat is not my property. I also don't think a judge can't tell you not to restrict liberty (which was a power given to congress) if due process is given...which it is by creating a law. If you jail someone without a court hearing you violated due process. In short 1) judges don't define liberty 2) they don't get to restrict it\n \n \nNo, I don't think so. Different times, different technologies, different issues. What would work then won't necessarily work now. What was accepted then doesn't have more backing, imo.\n Which is certainly why a living constitution is no good. With a democracy atleast you can change laws (and the constitution)..with a living constitution, supported by substantive due process, this is not the case. Laws can't change with the times...unless you pass a constitutional amendment for all of them which is near impossible.\n \n \n\n In this case, it is pretty cut and dry. Each defendant must have an attorney. I don't see how you can wiggle out of that, unless attorneys are required to provide free services. That would be fine with me too. However, Congress should have enforced this upon the States, not SCOTUS.\n It doesn't say you MUST have an attorney...it says you have \"a right to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\" You can obvioulsy choose not to have one. If you want one..it says nothing about who pays for it. It is a huge stretch to say that. I have the right to property...doesn't mean the government must pay for it. More so, it doesn't that police have to tell you this. This is probably the biggest stretch. \n \n \nIn the area of judging law? Yes. \n IN the area of government....you make them the strongest branch of government.

Say there was a judge who believed in Substantive Due Process and agreed with your views.

Nothing I've seen suggests that the authors did not believe in the principles that Blackstone laid down, while it is obvious that the principles were discussed and lauded in connection with individual liberty. In fact, during the debate Representative Thayer said: [The Fourteenth] is but incorporating in the Constitution of the United States the principle of the civil rights bill which has lately become a law.\n \n \nLike I said, the early looks at the 14th amendment didn't even have \"due process of law\". It was only added as a procedural thing....blackstones arguments were used long before \"due process of law\" was even added.\n\n \n I'm not sure that is as significant as you wish to make it. The intent of the Fourteenth was clearly to guarantee the individual freedom of the citizens of the various States against State legislation (or \"banning self-governance\" in your mind). Blackstone's principles could apply without that phrase.\n \n \nThe meaning of the word liberty is of no matter.\n\n \n Gah, I can hardly believe anyone would say such a thing. I'll have to remember that next time you cry \"OMG words have meaning OMG!\"\n \n \nIt means almost everything. The key phrase is that it can be taken away with due process of law. You can have your property taken away, you can have your life taken away, and you can have your liberty taken away(jailed).\n\n \n Yes. However, it is not outside of reasonableness to treat certain liberties deemed fundamental with extra protection against infringement. \n \n \nI also don't think a judge can't tell you not to restrict liberty (which was a power given to congress) if due process is given...which it is by creating a law.\n\n \n I'm not sure, but I think you just agreed with me.\n \n I know what your point is, and I obviously disagree that is the only mechanism that needs be satisfied.\n \n \nIf you jail someone without a court hearing you violated due process. In short 1) judges don't define liberty 2) they don't get to restrict it\n\n \n I have not suggested they do either of these things. The State restricts liberty with laws. If the Judges overrule that, they have not defined liberty but merely said the State was unjustified in this instance to restrict it. That of course only happens with certain liberties.\n \n \nWhich is certainly why a living constitution is no good.

It is valid to say you must have an attorney unless that right is waived.\n \n One has a right to property? Do tell; all I've seen is the freedom from the gov't taking your property away.\n \n \nIN the area of government....you make them the strongest branch of government. Contrary to what the federalists papers say.\n\n \n In what manner are they the strongest branch? Can they not be impeached? Can Congress not regulate and determine the scope of their appellate jurisdiction? Does not the President appoint them? What ultimate power do you think they have?\n \n The only power they have stems from the court cases they hear. They have the power to uphold or strike down laws, not to make them.\n \n \nYour thinking says any legal document can have changed meanings. I was referring to the legal document of a lease...not the constitution. Are you saying the constitution is the only legal document that has changing meanings?\n\n \n If the legal document contains terms that are not defined within that document then it can be defined outside that document for use within that document. Judges have the power to interpret phrases and terms that are not explicitly defined within the legal document (to a limited extent, anyway).\n \n In your little example, were you to be unsatisfied and believe the repairs were not done in a \"reasonable\" amount of time as the lease stated and sued him, a judge would then decide whether they were done in a \"reasonable\" amount of time.

   "sigh -_- I have had no internet for 4 days or so, and then I hit the \"x\" and that killed my post. I will cover the mean points without typing everything again. emoticon_angry \n \n \nIf the legal document contains terms that are not defined within that document then it can be defined outside that document for use within that document.\n No, the word \"rent\" is not defined in my lease..I don't get a judge to make it up. \n \n The main point of my post was that judges aren't, and never were meant to be, the ones that get to define what a liberty is. Otherwise we might as well have judges elected. Maybe I should get Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity on the court so I can get all my conservative views into the word liberty. No more taxes for the rich and since it is Ann Coulter, I think all gay topics will be off the table for the next 50 years. In fact, if the judges are the ones to define all of this then why do we even have a constitution? There is no reason for the 14th amendment if we are just going to change what it means every time a new judge is elected. It seems odd that even your own substantive due process idea has evolved. It used to just include liberties fundamental in the foundings of our country....Now it means any liberty the judge feels is a good one. A very subjective standard. It should be of no surprise to anyone why judges are divided on party lines now. Your view makes no sense it wasn't the standard for many years and shouldn't be now.\n \n \nIn your little example, were you to be unsatisfied and believe the repairs were not done in a \"reasonable\" amount of time as the lease stated and sued him, a judge would then decide whether they were done in a \"reasonable\" amount of time.

Sure, reasonable will have to determined in your case but that doesn't mean reasonable can change next time I have a court case against my leasing company. This is not what you are arguing for though. You are of the belief that \"rent\" or \"reasonable\" could and should change based on what the judge had for breakfast that morning. Granted we are straying away from constitutional law now and getting more into a common law. \n \n I had a lot more but I am frustrated that it all got closed out :xbanghead",
