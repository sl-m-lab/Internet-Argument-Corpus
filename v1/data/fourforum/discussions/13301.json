   "\"Fearful that they're losing ground on immigration and health care, a group of House Democrats is pushing back and arguing that any health care bill should extend to all legal immigrants and allow illegal immigrants some access. \"\n Liberals seek health-care access for illegals - Washington Times\n\n Yes. There are some liberals who are pushing for these things.\n NOT Obama.\n And their desires are REBUTTED by the actual text of the legislation.\n \n This article should read \"Some democrats want something, but Obama is actually behind restricting illegal immigrants from the government healthcare insurance plan, which is supposedly what Republicans want\"",

   "Dude, I'd like the same thing (a little honesty in the discussion)....you keep referring to the fact that Obama and legislation say they won't be covered. But you are being intellectually dishonest by not admitting that they WILL be covered, in one form or another....whether it be with Dems/Libs pushing through a bill allowing them to be covered, or by legislation granting them amnesty. Either way, people that DO NOT deserve to be covered WILL BE covered, it can't be more obvious. Your concern seems to be with PROTECTING Obama and not with what's just plain wrong or right.",

I have already explained that Obama HAS BEEN TOUGHER on illegal immigration than Bush was.\n You give no response to that.\n \n I have also explained what the ACTUAL existing legislation is. The fact that some democrats want the legislation to be something else IS NOT EVIDENCE that it will change to that in the future... :xbanghead\n \n \n \nEither way, people that DO NOT deserve to be covered WILL BE covered, it can't be more obvious. Your concern seems to be with PROTECTING Obama and not with what's just plain wrong or right.\n\n Your assessment couldn't be farther from the truth.\n If I were to see any actual sign that Obama were to change the legislation, against his prior statement, I would object to that vigorously.\n I see no validity your imagination.\n \n I am firmly against \"amnesty\" for illegal aliens.\n That is a SEPARATE issue, and I refuse to pretend healthcare reform has any illegitimacy because of that SEPARATE issue.\n The really pathetic part of that argument is that you have presented NO EVIDENCE for why Obama could be claimed to be \"planning\" that.\n Yet you insist I am \"intellectually dishonest\" for not blindly believing your fears...\n :xbanghead",
