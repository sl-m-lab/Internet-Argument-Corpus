   "Patients Who Rely on Religion to Cope Are More Likely to Have Aggressive Medical Care\n \n March 17, 2009 -- Terminally ill cancer patients who relied on their religious faith to help them cope with their disease were more likely to receive aggressive medical care during their last week of life, a study shows.\n \n Patients who engaged in what the researchers called positive religious coping, which included prayer, meditation, and religious study, ended up having more intensive life-prolonging interventions such as mechanical ventilation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\n \n The study is published in the latest edition of The Journal of the American Medical Association.\n \n The patients who reported a high level of positive religious coping at the start of the study were almost three times as likely to receive mechanical ventilation and other life-prolonging medical care in the last week of life as patients who said they relied less on their religious beliefs to help them deal with their illness.\n \n A high level of religious coping was also associated with less use of end-of-life planning strategies, including do-not-resuscitate orders, living wills, and appointment of a health care power of attorney.\n \n It is not entirely clear why terminally ill patients who report relying more on their religion would choose more life-prolonging medical interventions.\n\n Religion's Impact on End-of-Life Care\n \n I've heard the phrase \"No atheists in foxholes\". It's a quaint phrase that says more about fear based on convenient assumptions.\n Above is a real situation that speaks to the inverse of that claim.\n People of religion who find that in approaching death, they cling more to life OVER what they believe would be waiting for them on the other side, like heaven.\n \n If you think that when you die you're going to heaven, why fight so hard against getting there?",

   "Religion's Impact on End-of-Life Care\n \n I've heard the phrase \"No atheists in foxholes\". It's a quaint phrase that says more about fear based on convenient assumptions.\n Above is a real situation that speaks to the inverse of that claim.\n People of religion who find that in approaching death, they cling more to life OVER what they believe would be waiting for them on the other side, like heaven.\n \n If you think that when you die you're going to heaven, why fight so hard against getting there?\n\n \n I suspect you haven't really thought through all the possibilities here.

(Then skeptics will criticize them in cases where they turn down medical care for themselves or their family! The just can't win, now can they?) So you're not giving them the leeway--in your view--to have a view that God can work through doctors. I don't see why belief in miracles should require one to intentionally ONLY rely on miracles.",

Why JUST prayer?\n\n I'm not talking about NOT \"taking advantage of both\".\n But the fact of the matter is that there is a distinguishing difference here.\n BOTH the \"rely on religion to cope\" and the \"don't rely on religion to cope\" crowd rely on the doctor's skill.\n \n The real issue is why the \"rely on religion to cope\" crowd seeks more aggressive treatment at the end stage.\n \n \n \nThis is what I don't get.\n\n That part you got right...\n \n \nThis is what I don't get.

   "Let's get some reality here. The endpoints of this study were choosing to have CPR or mechanical ventilation. \n \n Some posters here clearly don't understand the situation. Establishing \"Do not resuscitate orders\" (DNR= no CPR) does not mean we stop caring for patients. It means that if your heart stops (this is called dying) that the care team will allow that person to die. Anyone who knows anything about this knows that the chances of actually being resuscitated are very low. In a sick person, even lower. In a person with terminal cancer, they are as close to zero as they need to be to know that CPR or mechanical ventilation is a stupid and cruel thing to do that person. \n \n \n Persons who have an in-hosptial arrest have less than a 1% chance of leaving the hospital or living more than 30 days. CPR is successful for that 34 year old who has a heart attack while jogging. Take a person, who is sick enough with cancer for their heart and lungs to stop - that person is not coming back. This is how one dies of cancer. It should be allowed to happen.\n \n The patients here were not acutely ill (that means suddenly ill). They have had a long time to discuss end-of-life issues. If I had a terminal illness - an illness that is certainly going to kill me, I would not want to spend the last few hours or days on a ventilator. Nor would I want to go out having 20 strangers in a room mashing on me and flogging me for 45 minutes until the \"code gets called\". This stuff lasts 45 minutes because you have to do this. Everyone knows it is futile. This is what happens when you do CPR to a sick person. It is a terribly inhumane and undignified thing to do to someone. \n \n I cannot know the individual circumstances but I suspect that most of the persons who didn't NOT want to be DNR is this situation either have not been apprised of the seriousness of their illness (unlikely), or were in denial about it and overestimated their chances of living or were terrified of death and close to hang on to the last second no matter how horrible it was. \n \n Everyone needs to see a video of CPR in a hospital. It ain't like you see on TV. It is horrible and almost no one lives. We have ways to care for the dying, like hospice care that are much more humane and loving.",

I just wish you'd also look at other possbilities besides ONLY glass-half-empty ones.\n\n I grow bored with this junk.\n What \"glass-half-empty\" possibility have I proposed?\n Answer the question Jyoshu preferably quoting me, although I fully expect nothing more than your obfuscation.\n \n \n \nDude, my own father had hospice care in my home up until he died. I think I know a thing or two about it. None of what you say disproves that end-of-life can still be a scary thing.\n\n AGAIN we come back to the whole issue that there are TWO GROUPS GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING...\n \n There is ANOTHER \"non-religious coper\" person (comparatively) suffering from TERMINAL CANCER in another bed. And that person is LESS likely to seek the \"aggressive measures\" that are only going to stall the inevitable...\n \n It's scary for BOTH groups.\n But the NON-religious copers DO NOT HAVE religion to help them \"cope\". The RELIGIOUS copers are looking at it (or would be from a logical emoticon_rolleyes stand-point) that they are going on to a BETTER PLACE.\n The NON-religious copers would conceivably have MORE reason to be scared, cause when they die that is IT. No heaven. No meeting loved ones on the other side. No meeting the loved ones still on earth at a later date on the other side.\n \n It is a scary thing for BOTH groups, so why is it that the \"religious coper\" group experiencing that fear doesn't \"cope\" with their fear in the logically advantaged way????\n No. I don't expect an answer from you Jyoshu cause you're just going to complain about \"conclusions\" that I haven't given... emoticon_rolleyes",

   "I was giving some other REASONS. Others besides the usual religion-at-fault type ones.\n Well, then tell that to someone in the hospital wrestling with the decision. Tell the person that still needs to make peace with family to not worry about it and just give up. Tell the parent to just pull the plug on their child 'cause they're being 'foolish and cruel and wasteful' leaving them in this world. Then your determined stance on this would actually mean something. Because this isn't just a theoretical issue--it's a daily issue for some people and comes up in REAL life all the time. It's an issue for which the rubber DOES meet the road, and if you wouldn't put your money where your mouth is, you're a hypocrite, pure and simple. Believe it or not, not everyone may be ready to give up, machine or not. \n Yep, and anything over and above that stated is speculative. That's my point. \n\n You can't seem to decide which position to take. First you maintain that people do not relish the prospect of kicking off, therefore, they want to live as long as possible. This is true when not talking about the terminally ill. Which we are. Then when it is pointed out to you that we this is about the prevention of suffering, not the prolongation of a happy, carefree life, you accuse me of wanted to callously encourage patients to stop trying altogether and pull the plug capriciously. That's blowing smoke. \n \n Describing the situation as \n \nTell the parent to just pull the plug on their child 'cause they're being 'foolish and cruel and wasteful' leaving them in this world.\"\n\n is inaccurate and sensational and not what we are talking about here. \n \n This is about the decision to end suffering or prolong it when death is inevitable. I have very often encouraged families to be less aggressive with the end-of-life care. Almost universally, patients and their families have unrealistic understandings and need to be educated about the situation and advised of the probabilities involved. Then they gladly pursue fewer heroics when the situation is futile. It makes the dying process \"better\" as well. It really does. There is such a thing as a \"good\" death - one in which the patient calls the shots and remains as comfortable as possible with his loved ones around. Also I have been involved personally with the death of dozens of friends who have made similar decisions. \n \n So what we are talking about here is this situation: looking at that small group of people who choose to pursue what most every knowledgeable person would call heroics, or overly aggressive terminal care. Note the comparative \"overly.\"\n \n Maybe you might decided to spend the last minutes of your life getting your clothes ripped off, pierced repeatedly with large bore needles, having your ribs broken with CPR, getting a tube stuffed down your trachea trying to revive your body that has been dead for a while and ain't coming back. That's a really nice experience for a family who has been through months or years of illness and suffering. \n \n As to what this means, you use the term \"speculation\" to suggest that inferences drawn from studies are blind guesses. This is how science works. You get an idea. You study it as objectively as you can and you get results. Sometimes the results surprise you and you ask why. That leads to further study. \n \n The only explanation you have come up with here is \"I dunno what it could mean, but you guys want to make religion look bad.\"",

After all, it's not like this is the first time you've noticeably grabbed onto ONLY to the religion-implicating possibility, or assumed it's because of something NEGATIVE. (And then you turn around and profess to use \"science\" to justify it, when science would never just jump on only the implicating possibility without taking others into consideration.)

(I could have talked about the color of socks the patients wore, but that wasn't what the study looked at.) The study showed that an extraordinary health care choice was made twice as commonly by religious people. That's not spin. Those are the results. I am sorry this bothers you.",
