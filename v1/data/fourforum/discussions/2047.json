   "Personally, I find the international news offered by US media outlets sorely lacking in content. IF you want information about the terrorist attack in spain, it would seem logical that a spanish station would be the best option. If you want informaion about a British terrorist arrest, a British station would seem to be the best source of info. \n \n Granted, not all stations are going to be objective or impartial, but American media is often far from objective and impartial as well. THe bias in some news stories is (IMHO) as important as the content of the story as it gives an important insight as to how other people in the world view world events. \n \n Why would you be offended that the BBC refered to Hussein as \"President Saddam Hussein\"? That was his proper title. Use of the term \"president\" does not always imply a democratic election. We do tend to associate it that way in America, but that is a national bias.\n \n Here is the dictionary definition of \"president\":\n \n \n1. One appointed or elected to preside over an organized body of people, such as an assembly or meeting. \n 2. Abbr. Pres. \n a. The chief executive of a republic. \n b. President The chief executive of the United States, serving as both chief of state and chief political executive. \n 3. The chief officer of a branch of government, corporation, board of trustees\n",
