Both are abuses of our system.\n \n In my mind it would only make sence to aviod this kind of fraud by allowing gays to legally marry those of whom they are actually romantically involved. Anything else is a lie and a fraud on tax payors. \n \n I guess heterosexuals must actually enjoy paying out their tax money to promote and perpetuate fruad. \n :xbanghead",

   "And that is exactly the \"Other story\" Ladywolf was projecting.\n\n \n Not quite. The state doesn't force anybody into any relationship. Even in the absence of legitimate homosexual marriage, lesbians are not forced to marry heterosexual men. They, of course, may do so if they choose but if they are physically repulsed by the thought of sexual intercourse with men why would they? \n \n I suppose you could try to make the argument that they deserve the same privileges as married people and the only way to recieve them is to marry outside their sexual preference. I think this is where you are trying to go with this whole thing. By putting same-sex marriage on the same level of 'marriage-of-conveniece' you are really shooting yourself in the foot.\n \n Whistler",
