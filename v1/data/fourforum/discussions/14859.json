I think i like the last guy's explanation best, that we are more docile and not necessarily dumber. I can understand the 'getting dumber' though, since we have become way more dependent on each other, and as a whole, I would probably say that even if individuals are dumber, the populations collectively are smarter. \n \n On a semi related note, I've read about chimps using and understanding currency, using spears to hunt, going to war with other groups of chimps and running organized attacks. I've also read about elephant burial rituals, revenge on villages for killing elephants, and their extremely complex social systems. Then there's Alex the parrot who seemed to actually understand language and could solve complex problems (look him up on youtube), bonobos who can learn thousands of human words, dolphins and seals that can solve problems and tests...

You have no such insight so you will worry more about saving this puny life than preserving your soul for eternity.\n\n \n I asked, \"If Islam is right and you go to hell, was it your fault?\" You completely avoided it by saying (and I'm paraphrasing), \"Well, it's not right.\" That's not the point. You are firm in your belief in Christianity. I am firm in my unbelief. IF Christianity was true, it would not be my fault that I don't believe. Why can't you answer the question? \n \n You did answer my other question (somewhat grudgingly, though, it seems), by saying that the Christians did not commit suicide when killed for their beliefs... But Christians are not the only ones who have died for their beliefs. Every major religion has had martyrs, trials, tribulations, persecutions, etc. It doesn't make their beliefs correct. Believing something really, really hard, does not make it true. \n \n Anyway, though, with your answer that the Christians did not commit suicide, obviously if hell existed, atheists and 'sinners' who go there would not be guilty of sending themselves there. \n \n \nAgain, God didn't create hell for you or me, you will choose it willingly by denying the truth which He has instilled in each of us and in the world around us as evidence of His existence. That you refuse to see this reality is your fault, not His. He personally came and died for your sins as the perfect lamb of God whom you mock and reject in your arrogance and spitefulness. So you will reap in death what you sow in life in the coming judgement.\n\n \n He didn't instill the truth in anyone. If that was the case, ministries wouldn't be necessary. In fact if that were the case, some of those African tribes and groups that haven't made contact with the civilized world should have discovered Jesus on their own. Instead, most of them worship the sun, or animals, etc. There are many of us who used to believe in Christianity and HAVE looked in our hearts and wanted to believe, and found nothing. \n \n And one last thing... How does it even make logical sense that I, or anyone can be forgiven of any wrongdoing by way of an innocent person being killed? If some innocent guy came forward in 1945 and offered to be killed and tortured so that Hitler could be forgiven, I don't think anybody would have accepted that. Human sacrifice to forgive other human's 'sins' is immoral and nonsensical.",

I'd have to say the best might be the water bear (aka the tardigrade), though. These guys are awesome.\n \n \nMore than 1,000 species of tardigrades have been described. Tardigrades occur over the entire world, from the high Himalayas[3] (above 6,000 metres (20,000 ft)), to the deep sea (below 4,000 metres (13,000 ft)) and from the polar regions to the equator.\n \n The most convenient place to find tardigrades is on lichens and mosses. Other environments are dunes, beaches, soil, and marine or freshwater sediments, where they may occur quite frequently (up to 25,000 animals per litre). Tardigrades often can be found by soaking a piece of moss in spring water.[4]\n \n Tardigrades are able to survive in extreme environments that would kill almost any other animal. Some can survive temperatures of &#8722;273 \u00b0C (&#8722;459 \u00b0F), close to absolute zero,[5] temperatures as high as 151 \u00b0C (304 \u00b0F), 1,000 times more radiation than other animals,[6] and almost a decade without water.[7] In September 2007, tardigrades were taken into low Earth orbit on the FOTON-M3 mission and for 10 days were exposed to the vacuum of space. After they were returned to Earth, it was discovered that many of them survived and laid eggs that hatched normally.[8]\n\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade\n \n \n Oh, and yeah, bacteria is a pretty big deal, too.",

   "Sure. But he didn't.\n\n \n Excellent.\n \n Next question: do you think it's possible to choose to believe - genuinely believe, not just pay lip-service to - an idea that strikes you as flawed, contradictory or nonsensical?\n \n As a fer-instance, imagine I come up to you and quite earnestly explain that the all-powerful and benevolent god of magpies, GOM, who created the world in his own image (the shape of a magpie) and to whom magpies are sacred, demands that you spin around clockwise three times whenever you see a magpie, or else you will be sent to Heck when you die. If you don't accept GOM into your heart, you will also go straight to Heck.\n \n Now, Heck sounds like a pretty unpleasant place, and you'd rather avoid it if you could. Indeed, Heck is so infinitely unpleasant that even the remotest chance of me being right is too great a risk to take.\n \n Could you force yourself to believe, under those circumstances?\n \n Or might your thoughts run thus:\n \n The world clearly isn't shaped like a magpie. Peeling says the curve of the horizon is just the top of it's head, but there are people flying all over the world all the time - there's no way they could miss something like a beak or a leg sticking out. Besides, a magpie is a thing that flies in approximately one earth atmosphere and gravity, perches on branches and eats... actually I'm not sure, but I have a nasty feeling it's other birds. The idea of one existing in the formless void before the universe is just silly; it's like imagining a god shaped like a typewriter with a QWERTY keyboard: completely arse-backwards. And why would a magpie-god create such limited creatures in his own image, not to mention obliging them to regularly consume the flesh of other living organisms to survive when the planet is orbiting an all-but inexhaustible power-supply? Why would an all-powerful, supposedly wise and benevolent creator be so insecure as to need constant reassurance through otherwise meaningless ritual, or be so angered by one of his creations thinking along the lines I am here that he would unleash infinite, unrelenting agony upon it - rather as if I, upon seeing an unwelcome ant skittering across my kitchen worktop, were to not merely carry it outside - or even thoughtlessly squash it - but instead grant it immortality for the sole purpose of torturing it forever as punishment for its trespass. And anyway, there's another guy telling me I have to spin anticlockwise, not clockwise, and both tell me I'll go to Heck if I get it wrong.\n \n Actually, I wouldn't blame you for dismissing the idea without going into anywhere near that much detail.\n \n So, given that I have gone into that much detail - and more - thinking about the stories you (and others) have told me, and I cannot make them make sense no matter how hard I try, is it truly fair to say I am choosing not to believe?\n \n If you cannot honestly say that you could choose to believe in GOM, then you cannot in good conscience call my lack of belief a choice either.",

We do know from History that Most of the Biblical Stories were borrowed from earlier cultures. The Laws were borrowed from Hammurabi. The Story of Noah and the Ark was borrowed from early Babylonian Myths, even Noah's sons names were copies from the original story. Your book is Nothing more than borrowed Fairy tales and Old Laws , rewritten by no one knows, and put together to build a religion to control people like you.. \n \n Your Precious Gospels can't even agree on the details of the so call resurrection , so how is anyone to take them serious. As I asked in my previous post, Show me Evidence OUTSIDE your book of fairy tales , anything that doesn't come from the Bible. You keep trying to push your Book of Myth as if it's the only proof needed, which to any sane person it is not. \n \n I'll stop now since Pappy just got through busting you in his reply to your nonsense..

The Old testament was written years before the new, they simply read the old and fit Jesus in to fill a need. there's no proof or evidence he was divine...\n\n \n Mark was definitely written first. Both Luke and Matthew were written later and used Mark (and at least one other shared source). John was written way later and is considered much less accurate compared to the others. They were all originally written in Greek. You can tell that the writers of the gospels referenced the Septuagint (a Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament) because they retained some of the errors that occurred in the translations. The most famous example is the virgin/young woman error. \n \n I love the topic of the Gospels and how they were written. If you look at Mark, a lot of the stories are more 'bare bones' and much less 'magical' or 'miraculous.' When you look at the other gospels, you can see that they tried to spice up some of the stories to make them seem more miraculous, and at times they tried to fix mistakes. There is a website that is really interesting (but also really hard to find your way around... There is no good index, so you find yourself clicking a bunch of links and opening a lot of tabs). \n \n Rejection of Pascal's Wager: A Skeptic's Guide to Christianity\n \n It talks about a lot of this stuff and has plenty of references and examples for its claims. Some of the key things that I find most interesting are on the sources of the gospels:\n \n Rejection of Pascal's Wager: Jesus\n \n This part talks about how Mark was written first and shows how it was used by the other authors of the gospel. It also has some of the 'improvements' in the other gospels.\n \n Rejection of Pascal's Wager:The Proof of Markan Priority\n \n My favorite 'improvement' that I think is most telling is in the story of the cursed fig tree. \n \n This part talks about how Mark was written first and shows how it was used by the other authors of the gospel. It also has some of the 'improvements' in the other gospels.\n \n \nThe first nature miracle we will look at is one that is for most Christians more of an embarrassment than anything else. It concerns the cursing of the fig tree by Jesus. Given below is Mark's account of the miracle:\n \n Mark 11:12-21\n On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he [Jesus] was hungry. And seeing in a distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. And he said, \"May no fruit ever come from you again.\" And his disciples heard it...As they passed by in the morning they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots. And Peter remembered and said to him, \"Master, look! The fig tree you cursed had withered. \n Mark's account makes Jesus look deranged. It was clearly stated that it was not the season for figs. The story was set just before the Passover, around the end of March or early April, when figs are never ripe during that time in Palestine. Any native of the land would not have expected to find fruit on a fig tree at that time. To curse a fig tree for not bearing fruit out of its season is, to say the least, not an act of a sane person. Thus either the story, as it appears in Mark is either unhistorical or Jesus had become insane just before his crucifixion.\n \n If we now look at the same story told in the gospel of Matthew we will note that this evangelists had changed some elements of the story to make it both more credible and more incredible at the same time:\n \n Matthew 21:18-20\n In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry. And seeing a fig tree by the wayside he went to it, and found nothing on it but leaves only. And he said to it, \"may no fruit ever come form you again.\" And the fig tree withered at once. When the disciples saw it they marveled, saying, \"How did the fig tree wither at once?\" \n Note the changes Matthew had made to the Markan account. He had omitted the line where Mark noted that it was not the season for figs. This will make Jesus' reaction after not finding fruit on the tree more credible. Note also how Matthew had sensationalized the miracle. He made the fig tree wither at once. And made the disciples notice that fact. In Mark's account, the tree was found to be withered by the disciples only on the next morning. Again I will ask the tiresome question: how can we trust the gospel accounts of miracles when we see them enhancing and altering their sources to suit their own theologies and preconceptions?\n \n In any case the cursing of the fig tree as depicted by Mark could not be historical. The theologian D.E. Nineham had suggested that the story probably originated from some conspicuous withered tree on the road between Bethany and Jerusalem which gave rise to the legend that Jesus had cured it. A likelier possibility is that this story was originally a parable about figs (as we find in Luke 13:6-9) that was distorted by the oral tradition. [1]\n \n Luke 13:6-7\n Then [he] told this parable: \"A man had a fig tree, planted in his vineyard and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any. So he saud to the man who took care of the vineyard. \"For three years now I've been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven't found any. Cut it away! Why should it use the soil?\" \n\n \n Rejection of Pascal's Wager:The Nature Miracles\n \n There is also stuff about biblical errors, proofs that the traditional authors didn't write what they are thought to, and more. You just have to dig around.",

Traditions like the Gospels were and to a much less degree are still passed on orally. They also believed that the coming judgement would be soon. It wasn't until people started dying and as competition for who were the true holders of the religion started to become problematic that someone thought it might be a good idea to write some of this stuff down. In response every Tom Dick and Harry discovered something that made them someone to be listened to. \n \n For a long time differences between versions went mostly unnoticed. People didn't travel much in a way that would permit them to hear different versions to the point a major inconsistancy would stand out. I think it was around 235 that the first written account of a Bishop listing what books would be read in church in response to his previously permitting a book that taught something unacceptable.\n \n The modern Canon was established to give authority to the Church and discredit Gnostics and others like them. By that time the originals were gone and each book had several versions that various churches regarded as the correct book or letter. They ended up deciding most of the Canon, ex communicated the minority disenters basing their decision on what they guessed to be the closest to what they believed the text should be. In other words they chose what they wanted from a pool of forged, altered books whose validity was at best hoped to be close enough to the original that they wouldn't all burn for eternity.\n \n Yep excellent choice for custodian of man's salvation. Did a real bang up job of keeping man's only hope free of corruption.\n \n Since most early Chrristians were Gentiles Greek was the language most had in common and was spoken by much of the area at the time.",

   "I raise you bottom of the ocean ;) Besides, humans aren't actually adapted to space; the international space station is not a 'colony'. We can't live there, self-sufficient. \n\n Remember we don't care how something is adapted to somewhere just that they are. We are living up there, that our brains did it and not a series of mutations is kind of my point.\n \n Even on the bottom of the ocean macroscopic life has won the race for resources.\n \n \nYou're joking, right?\n \n Poke a couple of holes in the blob and see how far that gets you. Run it over with a car. Put it in a blender. All you have to do to kill the human is slightly disrupt the relative positions of some of its parts.\n\n I am not joking, the easiest way to kill the blob and not the human would be to leave both well enough alone in practically any environment on earth.\n \n The bacteria would starve, burn, freeze on the whole while a human with the things he has made would not.\n \n \nBacterial colonies don't have circulatory systems; that's why they can't easily form macroscopic structures.\n\n That is because they are less advanced (missing code to create circulatory systems).\n \n \nVery likely. Not especially relevant though. If we lived in the water you would describe air-dwelling creatures as inferior because they can't move freely in 3 dimensions :)\n\n Yet humans can swim, move over land, and fly better than any other species.\n \n \nYep. Check out faecal transplantation for some interesting analysis (pun intended).\n\n I don't believe you are correct, look at this abstract.\n \n \n \nGiven that bacteria are omnipresent, and evolution rarely passes up an opportunity to leverage a plentiful resource, it's likely that every organism on earth is symbiotic with some form of bacteria or other. Even assuming we could live without our immediate bacterial buddies, could we live if everything else on earth died, as a direct or indirect consequence of the elimination of bacteria?\n\n I am really not buying this, I am sure that bacteria have found themselves nice niches with many other organisms but I have a very hard time buying the idea that even a fraction of those cases are co-dependant.\n \n\n The Oxygen Revolution\n\n Oh I see this was before true plants. I knew it was photosynthesis so I assumed it would be plants.",
