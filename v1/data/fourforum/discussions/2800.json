Foreign investors in our treasury issues are getting emphatic about better returns as the dollar continues that weakening process. Does anyone else see inflation being used as a groundless excuse to raise interest rates as the dollar's purchasing power declines?\n \n US vehicle inventories are well over 60-days, not a good sign with a new model year right around the corner. \n \n Can the administration continue to fake it through the election?",

Our foregin investors are lloking at the offering, factoring in inflation, and realising that they may be better off with an interest bearing checking account in the caymans at 8%.\n \n I think that trying to class the interest rate hikes as inflationary control is just another sad excuse created for the benifit of the unwashed masses.\n \n It will be interesting to see what happens when the domestic construction and housing bubbles burst and people learn that the $200,000.000 house they just bought (and still owe $180,000.00 on) has a relative value of $140,000.00. \n \n It will also be interesting to see how the real estate market reacts tot he interest rate hikes, especially the used house market. we have seen a sellers market the last few years as buyers scramble to take advantage of the low rates.

Rent control could easily be tucked into the Patriot Act, so I'm staying away from those investments. \n \n We're listing our city home for sale this week in an attempt to capitalize on the boom and take advantage of the expanded capital gain ride before both go away.

I am still kickin gmyself for not investing heavily when the euro first emerged and took its initial nose dive. There wa a week or 2 there that the euro was dirt cheap, until we relaised that Germany was propping it up, at which price it climbed back to normal levels. Opportunity lost.

Here was a chance to take money they'd never get in their hands, without current income taxation, invested in what the 'experts' considered premium growth equity stocks. \n \n In their haste to become set for life, they neglected to consider that taxes always go up, not down, the alternative minimum tax rate tiger, substantial early withdrawal penalties, an inability to borrow against those funds as allowed by a stock or bond margin account, the volatility of equity markets and last and most important, our national fiscal policies and their affect on the dollar value. \n \n Government gets to keep SS tax revenue for the general fund, companies are relieved of retirement contributions (United Airlines just announced they're discontinuing retirement contributions as part of the Chapter 11 reorganization) and fund managers, who never explained the different classes of 401K participation, are living the good life with an ability to virtually control equities markets and their now over book value narrow band of fluctuation. \n \n As the economy continues to deteriorate, many contributors will eat the withdrawal penalties to live.

Domestic residential construction, with highly inflated material costs (steel, cement and lumber) and land values, is being financed at over 100% of boom time appraised values using first and second mortgage positions. Most of the hard money second position lenders have been forced out of the market by banks and other financial institutions seeking to expand their loan portfolios to offset dwindling deposit circumstances under current federal interest policies. There are going to be some enormous bags of air on the books of private and public lending institutions and the quasi-government mortgage packagers. When the air goes out, cash flow will become challenging, to say the least. \n \n Last I heard, they, including the government, were still pumping cash into LTCM.

They subscribe to 45% of our treasury issues, the cash flow that keeps us afloat in a time of declining tax revenues and deficit spending. Federal Government usage of tax revenues has expanded to where sharing of that revenue with the individual states has been sharply reduced, resulting in states incurring massive bond debt based on general revenue rather than specific revenue such as sales tax or other assigned revenue streams. I recently read an article where the State of Kansas has gone from 1992 bond debt of $200/person to $1150 in 2003, using low interest rates as a rationale. Most US municipal bonds at one time were 'solid gold', tax free and highly rated.

People seem to have a real problem with wanting to believe the best, and ignoring evidence to the contrary. There was another poster here a while back that said that I was a pessimist and they preferred to believe that the economy would straighten itself out and everything would be OK. I would prefer to believe that, too, but the facts don't seem to support that conclusion. \n \n I think it is going to be a somewhat rude wakeup call for americans when they finally realise that blind optomism is not the best policy.

How do you suggest the Government finance these deficits? Domestic savings is out of the question, and treasury printing more money is an appalling idea. \n \n \n I know it is a radical idea, but maybe the government could exercise some fiscal restraint rather than clamoring to finance an ever increasing deficit. As george noted, the presses are cranking up. I guess we will just drive inflation to the point where our half trillion dollar debt doesn't look so bad. After all, (sarcasm) it worked so well for germany (/sarcasm). \n \n \nThe Government had to implement discretionary stabilizers in 2001-02 to try and stimulate the US economy for obvious reasons. Over the next few years the US might see budgetary policy move further towards fiscal balance if the economic recovery continues. \n \n \n From a realistic standpoint, there has been no economic recovery. We are not producing any more real value good than we were before. What they are referring to as an \"economic recovery\" is little more than an increase int he GDP, whic realisticall means nothing except that we are shuffling money around in our pathetic \"service based\" economy. This is great news if you happen to be the US government and are taking a bite out of every transaction in the form of taxes. It means very little to anybody else.\n \n Unless you are actually bringing more money intot he country, you are not experiencing any kind of real, street level economic recovery, and we are certainly not bringin new wealth to America. Instead, our trade deficit is projected to increase for the forseeable future.

We have some in public office who seem to think that this is a great thing. We have others who are seriously questioning whether or not this is even legal under Kansas law (whihc requires a balanced budget). Both sides can agree on one thing, though, and that is we are simply pushing our problems off on the next generation and failing miserably when it comes to dealing with our current crop of economic woes.

Will the US turn to walled eclaves of wealthy people while, the poor and middle class slowly have their standard of living eroded to that of third world countries.\n\n \n IMO the scope of potential disaster, based on the size of the US economy, is an issue ignored by most Americans. During the economic depression following the stock market collapse of 1929 and ended by WW11, a majority of the population was living in rural circumstances with a degree of basic self-sufficiency. That situation is now reversed, with a majority of the population dependent on an economy that furnishes all basic necessities. \n \n Separation of haves and have-nots has been progressing for the past two decades. Most up-scale residence developments are now constructed in walled, gated and guarded communities. Very wealthy communities have law enforcement ratios of one cop, depending on the location, for every 10-100 residents. One small, wealthy city in Florida has one cop for every five residents, including household servants. As a comparison, in most major cities 2.5 cops per 1,000 citizens is now considered the rock-bottom minimum to keep crime within current, scary parameters considering our overloaded prisons and crippled justice system. Most larger US cities have large areas where one takes one's life in hand by merely driving through them during daylight hours. After dark, they belong to the residents.",

Will the US turn to walled eclaves of wealthy people while, the poor and middle class slowly have their standard of living eroded to that of third world countries.\n\n \n \n It seems that we are headed that way already, and I am not entirely convinced that there is anything that can be done to stop the slide, especially since so many refuse to admit that we are sliding. From a realistic standpoint, I think that the real problems will begin to show up as financial institutions become less willing to float loans to people who are frankly already overextended. \n \n The difficulty seems to be in getting people to understand that having the ability to borrow large sums of money is not the same as actually owning large sums of money. I shudder to think what will happen as the baby boomers start retiring and it becomes evident that their social security is little more than a pipe dream (which we could pull off, it would just be such a drain that it would destroy the rest of the economy). When you consider that retirees spend so much less on consumer goods, you are effectivley talking about removing a significantt percentage of your consumer trade while at the same time trying to pay that same percentage off. Factor in the near certainty of a major decline in the real estate markets in the not too distant future, and you quickly find that worst case scenario and best case scenario are not as far apart as we might wish.\n \n As far as the walled enclave, you might consider a nice place in the country, preferably with a couple of well trained security dogs (there is a place in utah that sells timber wolf/german shepard mixes that come right to your door perfectly trained for a very reasonable price.....I have 4 of them). I would certainly not want to live in suburbia as the economy dries up and millions of people suddenly find themselves unable to feed their families. Already you can look at domestic crime figures and see the wisdom in such an approach.\n \n Of course, the real danger from the lemmings who ran off the cliff and ended up in shanty towns shouldn't manifest itself until our government spends itself to death (which is happening rapidly) and can no longer afford to support social programs. When this happens, you may well want to start looking at some of those walled homes, or take a serious look at ordering a few hundred pounds of teeth and fur.\n \n Looking at some of the peak oil numbers floating around out there (the ones I usually use come from Exxon), you may do well to invest in some alternative energy supplies while you are at it. \n \n I am not saying it is time to go the nutjob living in a compound in central neveda route, but some precations may well be in order.
