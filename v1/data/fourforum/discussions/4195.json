   "Why not include probability of a male being killed in the US as versus the benchmark countries? Male and female as one statistic? \n \n In 2003 the US was 24th for intentional homicides per-capita in the world. When viewed as 'safest US states' to live in, those states with few or no restrictions on handgun ownership are at the top of the list. The deadliest US city for murders? Washington DC, which does not allow private handgun ownership for any purpose.\n \n Here's an excerpt on why the US, with its all-encompassing Christian fundamentalism being beaten into heads since birth as absolute moral values, kills women. And it isn't because of easy access to handguns: \n \n ~The way women are presented as victims of murder has been intrinsically linked to the social lessons and preconceptions of the time periods. The lesson in the 1800's is the same as today. The woman who is sexually active in ways that are deemed socially unacceptable, either premaritally (a nineteenth century taboo) or with multiple partners (a twentieth century taboo), are punished through violent deaths. The gender role of passive victim is reinforced, the violence being unprovoked by aggression on the female's part. Thus the representation of women victims in popular media over time has continually been influenced and in turn upheld the images of a patriarchal society.~\n \n Plucking statistics out of what are very complex statistical circumstances to support gun control is biased conversational manipulation.

Other developed and high income nations seem to better protect the right to life of their women.\n\n \n \n The reason for crimes against women rising is far more complex than just whether a state is pro gun or not. Back in the 1800's , women were held in high regard as the keeper of the home, the mother of the future of the country. As time passed thoughout the decades of metamorphising though fights for equality and finally putting them in the workforce as equals, somehow the learned respect for women was lost in their battle for individualism. They are now treated as equals, ( not always of course) and along with that goes being the reciepeint of men's hostility. ...\n \n Being the weaker sex in the physical world ( most of the time) they become the target of weak men, those that choose to take their gutless hostility out on a woman. The best thing a woman can do is first arm themselves with education . Let them then learn the ways of man, liken to the way a man learns the way of his prey in the woods. They need to learn men's strength's , his weaknesses, and then arm themselves with a .357 magnum, just to make certain all things will be equal, between them and the physically stronger species. all jmo",
