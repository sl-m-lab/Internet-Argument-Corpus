The usual argument from the fundies is that if anyone objects they can stand in silence (with head bowed) while those who wish may pray. Funny though, when I suggest the prayer, they suddenly don't think it's such a good idea - this is a \"christian\" nation. They are unwilling to stand in silence but expect others to do so.\n \n Can your spell hypocrisy? I knew you could.",
