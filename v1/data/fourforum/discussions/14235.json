And not to forget the 22 to 30 thousand laws on the books already, and when dealing with a Constitutional Right, all you are only allowed the bare minimum to keep society safe in general.

   "  Public corruption is one of the FBI&#8217;s top investigative priorities \n Public corruption is one of the FBI&#8217;s top investigative priorities&#8212;behind only terrorism, espionage, and cyber crimes. Why? Because of its impact on our democracy and national security. Public corruption can affect everything from how well our borders are secured and our neighborhoods protected&#8230;to verdicts handed down in courts&#8230;to the quality of our roads and schools. And it takes a significant toll on our pocketbooks, too, siphoning off tax dollars. Learn more here about our national program and local investigations.\n\n \n   PUBLIC CORRUPTION -- Why It&#8217;s Our #1 Criminal Priority \n Question: Why is public corruption so high on the FBI&#8217;s list of investigative priorities? \n Answer: Because of its impact. Corrupt public officials undermine our country&#8217;s national security, our overall safety, the public trust, and confidence in the U.S. government, wasting billions of dollars along the way. This corruption can tarnish virtually every aspect of society. For example, a border official might take a bribe, knowingly or unknowingly letting in a truck containing weapons of mass destruction. Or corrupt state legislators could cast deciding votes on a bill providing funding or other benefits to a company for the wrong reasons. Or at the local level, a building inspector might be paid to overlook some bad wiring, which could cause a deadly fire down the road.\n \n Q: Can you describe the kinds of public corruption that the FBI investigates?\n A: It really runs the gamut. Bribery is the most common. But there&#8217;s also extortion, embezzlement, racketeering, kickbacks, and money laundering, as well as wire, mail, bank, and tax fraud. Right now, based on our intelligence on emerging trends, we are focused specifically on several major issues: corruption along our national borders; corrupt officials who take advantage of natural disasters or economic crises to divert some of the government&#8217;s aid into their own pockets; and a myriad of officials who may personally benefit from the economic stimulus funding.\n \n Q: Where do you find this corruption?\n A: Just about everywhere&#8212;at the federal, state, and local levels throughout the country. And I should point out, the vast majority of our country&#8217;s public officials are honest and work hard to improve the lives of the American people. But a small number make decisions for the wrong reasons&#8212;usually, to line their own pockets or those of friends and family. These people can be found&#8212;and have been found&#8212;in legislatures, courts, city halls, law enforcement departments, school and zoning boards, government agencies of all kinds (including those that regulate elections and transportation), and even companies that do business with government.\n\n \n   Economic Stimulus Fraud/Corruption \n The U.S. Government recently enacted various economic stimulus programs that are injecting vast amounts of funding into the national economy through localized spending. Unfortunately, valuable programs like these&#8212;including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and the Neighborhood Stabilization Program&#8212;also create opportunities for corruption and fraud.\n Similar government fiscal spending responses to emergency situations, like Hurricane Katrina and the war on terrorism, have in the past resulted in numerous public corruption and government fraud investigations. To prevent and deter fraud from this latest spending, the FBI is working with its law enforcement partners to aggressively investigate allegations into the misuse of economic stimulus money.\n \n Examples of potential criminal acts include public officials using their position for personal gain, theft of government funds, extortion, contract bid-rigging, false appraisals, falsifying documents to qualify for funding, and contractor fraud. These criminal acts, especially when they are perpetrated by public officials, strike at the heart of government by eroding public confidence and undermining the strength of our democracy. And the investigation of public corruption is the FBI&#8217;s number one criminal investigative priority. It is also a mission for which the FBI is singularly situation: we have the skills and experience necessary to conduct undercover operations and court-authorized electronic surveillance.\n\n   Federal Election Crimes \n In democratic societies like the United States, the voting process is a means by which citizens hold their government accountable, conflicts are channeled into resolutions, and power transfers peacefully. Our system of representative government works only when honest ballots are not diluted by fraudulent ballots. When elections become corrupted, democracy becomes threatened.\n The FBI has a limited role in ensuring fair and free elections in the United States. Election crimes become federal cases when: \n \u00b7 The ballot includes one or more federal candidates; \n \u00b7 The crime involves an election official abusing his duties; \n \u00b7 The crime pertains to fraudulent voter registration; \n \u00b7 Voters are not U.S. citizens. \n Federal election crimes fall into three broad categories: \n 1. Campaign finance crimes\n 2. Voter/ballot fraud \n 3. Civil rights violations \n \n \n   MASSIVE CORRUPTION BUST Mayors, Rabbis, Politicians, and More  \n \n   COMBATING BORDER CORRUPTION -- Locally and Nationally  \n Imagine a U.S. border guard on the take waving through a truck filled with weapons, drugs, explosives, or even a dirty bomb.\n It&#8217;s that kind of scenario that keeps the FBI very focused on weeding out the occasional dishonest government official who accepts bribes to allow people or contraband into this country illegally.\n &#8230;.. &#8220;While it&#8217;s true that the most common acts of border corruption involve drug trafficking and human smuggling, a single incident of the wrong person getting into the country could result in a catastrophe.&#8221;\n\n \n   ABUSE OF TRUST The Case of the Crooked Border Official \n How it began\n In late 2004, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) contacted our field office in El Paso, Texas. One of their informants reported that Crispin was allowing shipments of illegal drugs into the U.S. through her border post in El Paso. \n Building the case\n Together with our partner agencies&#8212;ICE, the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s Inspector General, Customs and Border Protection, and the Drug Enforcement Administration&#8212;we began surveilling Crispin. We learned that not long after she was hired, Crispin&#8212;who lived meagerly in El Paso&#8212;acquired two expensive homes in Mexico, along with several luxury vehicles, but she attempted to cover her tracks with straw buyers. We also discovered that she socialized with known drug traffickers. \n\n \n Oil for food. Un Corruption. \n \n   Video from the CATO Institute. Washington is riddled with corruption, much of which actually is legal. The politicians and other insiders claim...\n \n  Abscam in the 80's \n \n That congressman who got caught with 50 thousand dollars in his freezer. The Arizona Savings and Loan kickbacks\n Obama's seat up for sale in Illinois.\n Just to name a few more.",

I have been thinking about this for a while, and I have one more concern. I just can't get this one off my mind. We tend to think of corruption as only financial. However, there is a different kind of corruption that we are experiencing. \n \n If one likes big government, a Nanny state, and Big spending, one is probably very happy like a bug in a rug. However if you were one of the millions of Americans who specifically told your Congressional critters to knock it off, (Tarp, Health care, Bailouts, Cap and Trade, Stimulus, all increasing the deficit to unsustainable levels etc.) you probably believe that We the People lost control of Congress, and the country is pretty much being run by the two Parties Leadership. Note that I am saying that We the People threw out the Republicans, before we WILL through out the Dems as well.\n \n That is very real corruption. Constitutional Corruption. We need to get back to our Founding Principles, where elected officials owe their entire allegiance to the voting public. \n \n Now one can spin this anyway they want, but voted dissatisfaction is an ever present reality! They seem not to be swayed by either party's spin! \n \n However, one thing is very clear, unless one decides to fix elections, you need us to vote for you.

   "Really? Why don't you go out and start randomly hurting and killing people and see how far that argument gets you in court.\n\n \n Because there's a vast difference between something that's the law, and something that's a right.\n \n And in case you hadn't noticed, the application of rights only applies when the government is involved. The Supreme Court has determined that your rights aren't violated by a private party, they can only be violated by the government or one of its entities.\n \n \nWhy is it that so many gun ownership advocates seem to be the last people I would want to see owning a gun? The world is not a Hollywood film or a video game. If you can't figure out why it is a big deal that guns can cause a lot of damage and need to be handled be responsibly, then frankly, in my opinion, you should not own one.\n\n \n Well fortunately you're not the one in charge and making these decisions. Last I checked the world wasn't a nice place, and there was no guarantee that your life was going to be neutral or moderate, or free from unpleasant and downright dangerous things. There's no ground to argue that the Constitution only protects things that can't ever cause harm to someone.\n \n \nFull responsibility means a dead two year old due to your loaded gun being left around unmonitored is a crime and you bear the criminal responsibility of that death.\n\n \n And if said two year old is killed in the commission of pulling on the cord of an unattended iron and it falls on their head, should the owner of the iron bear criminal responsibility of that death as well?\n \n \nReally? I challenge you to find a single initiative by gay people asking you to change your way of life. To marry someone of same sex or stay single. To have your consentual adult sexual activity criminalized. To have parenthood, housing or jobs be denied you due to your sexual orientation.\n\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/gay-rights-debates/14267-dc-mayor-pfox.html\n \n \nThis is not relevant to the debate at all. I shall not indulge your racism. Its not worth one iota of energy.\n\n \n And the thing about gays somehow is relevant?\n \n \nIts not BS. Stats prove it out. People are hurt and killed by their own weapons. It happens.\n\n \n No they don't, otherwise you'd have some actual evidence of a person, such as a woman with a concealed carry permit, having her gun taken right out of her hands, and being shot with it by the person who intended to mug her, thus warranting her to pull it on him.\n \n \nNot necesarily by stranger, it could be your angry spouse. I am not saying that you can not or should not own a gun because of this, I am just saying it happens.\n\n \n Such examples aren't a good enough excuse to suggest it'd be better to not be armed. If anything it's all the better to be armed.\n \n \nOf course. But children, especially small ones, do not have the comprehension skills or impulse control to simply be trusted around weapons without supervision. If you can't comprehend that, not only are you a poor gun owner, you are a poor excuse for a parent.\n\n \n If you can't teach your children to actually behave and obey, then you're the one that's a bad parent. If they don't want to learn, discipline them until they do.\n \n \nGun ownership comes with responsibilities. You can not and should not be allowed to go willfully and irresponsibly packing heat anymore than you can get loaded on a 12 pack of beer then go flying down the freeway at 90MPH.\n\n \n Owning a gun isn't willful irresponsibility. Neither is choosing to not own a solid steel locking safe, or gun locks that serve absolutely no point. Those that choose to not teach their children to be careful and responsible are the ones that should be punished for their actions.\n \n You wouldn't make the decision to not teach your children about the traffic light system, then there's no excuse for teaching them to avoid things that aren't toys.",

Is this your way of saying that 'the only ones' are entitled to exercise rights? I wouldn't call this an exercise of the 2A. More like a hired gun of the old West you so despise? \n \n \nI told him about this debate, he agrees with me. Having your gun where kids can access it is irresponsible, and in many states illegal.\n\n \n You are mixed up aren't you? You make the blanket claim that everyone but your brother (and you by default) leave their guns where kids can access them and are irresponsible and break State law. I would like to see you prove this assertion. Of course we know that badge toters are always experts, from the moment they pin one on and that is why we see so many of them shooting theirselves in the foot, rear ends and other places. You want to define your meaning of a 'kid'?\n \n \nOf course every gun owner should teach their child about gun safety. But that does not mean you allow them access to weapons.\n\n \n BS! A human being learns from both seeing, hearing and doing. That applies to everything. They should have supervised access when training. After that, you propose to put an age limit on responsibility? You jumped from 'kid' now to 'child'. Under brady definitions and other gun grabbers that would mean to 21 years old. \n \n \nWhen I was a child an aquaintance of our family had three year relative who blew his own brains out because his sorry-a$$ excuse for a daddy though it was safe to leave a loaded gun under his pillow and then take a nap.\n\n \n Yep, the old 'aquaintance' trick. Excuses you from having to prove anything except make a statement it happened and how. Got any more stories about how a friend of a friend who had told a friend who told you a story?\n \n \nMaybe I should add IQ test as a prerequisite to gun ownership.......\n\n \n Good idea. Let's make it a pre-requisite for posting on the board too. See we can apply it to all the BOR just to even things out. From what I have seen here on the board, you would be left out and unable to exercise any right.\n \n Yeah, you make all the rules for everyone and add anything you want and see how far you get. emoticon_xbye",

The point of this thread is what kind of laws should there be around gun ownershiip. In my opinion there are three - background checks (or some way to ensure you aren't selling to criminals), no mandatory gun ownership, gun owners should be accountable for damage done by their weapons due to their negligence. Leaving small children with unsupervised access to a weapon is negligence, the same way that leaving an infant alone in a tub of water is.

Its part of this debate because it is one of the reasons I choose not to own a gun myself. I also acknowledged that weapons also defend people. I have no problem with people carrying a weapon for their own protection, if they choose to.\n \n \nIt doesn't appear that anyone is keeping you from anything; on the other hand, it doesn't appear anyone agrees with you :)\n\n \n One of the things I got slammed for was \"no mandatory gun ownership\". There are places that have it. I don't agree with it. Thats not freedom, either. \n \n \nAnd some apparently never outgrow it. Like yourself for example. OTH, some \"children\" as young as 16 have fought in wars. children as young as 9 take hunter safety and hunt. 18 year olds become cops and soldiers and carry and use guns.

My point is that children/kids/teens do not have maturity to be given the same unfettered access to weapons as adults.\n \n Eighteen year olds are adults in the eyes of the law and not a child in my arguments.\n \n \nThere you go again, standing on the stump talking down to people who know more than you...again.\n\n \n This is not an argument, its an insult. \n \n \nTither has posted the accident/death models many times and you still want to move \"gun injury\" to the top of your list despite being WRONG.\n\n \n Its not my list. The stats quoted were from Childrens National Defense Organizations and Centers for Disease Control. And I am well aware that it is low on the list compared to auto accidents, falls, drownings. But it is still a problem. Too many kids are getting hurt with guns. None should be. I am sorry if its too much to ask ADULT gun owners to be careful with their guns when kids are around.\n \n \nI don't have to provide you with a reason to own a gun, it is a RIGHT. You can find it in the BOR, Second Amendment. I think you chose the wrong model to base your arguement on and now you are desperate to be relieved of the burden of proving yourself right. Next time devote a bit more time and responsibility BEFORE you abuse the 1A. emoticon_xbouncer\n\n \n See the big, bolded letters at the top and then take this rant to someone who actually disagrees with you.\n \n \nNon sense! Most do, maybe you were an exception :)\n\n \n Once again, not an argument.\n \n Children are not adults. There is a reason they have to live with grown ups, go to school, wait for specific ages to do things like drive, consume alcohol, work, operate heavy machinery, vote, own property, etc. A todler does not have the same reasoning skills and maturity as pre-schooler, a pre-schooler as a ten year old, a ten year old as a fifteen year old, a fifteen year old as an adult. This is medical fact, not nonsense.\n \n \nWell that certainly is impressive :( Now explain exactly why this is so important to you and why you chose 'your brother' for a model. Is this your way of saying that 'the only ones' are entitled to exercise rights? I wouldn't call this an exercise of the 2A. More like a hired gun of the old West you so despise? \n\n \n See big, bolded letters at the top.\n \n \nYou are mixed up aren't you? You make the blanket claim that everyone but your brother (and you by default) leave their guns where kids can access them and are irresponsible and break State law.\n \n \n I did no such thing. I said that doing so is irresponsible and illegal in some states. And for the record, I do not own a gun and do not want to. I am starting to suspect you have not read the entire history of these threads.\n \n \nI would like to see you prove this assertion. Of course we know that badge toters are always experts, from the moment they pin one on and that is why we see so many of them shooting theirselves in the foot, rear ends and other places. \n\n \n You do understand that they go through years of training to be a cop? I am not saying there are perfect or the only ones that can be trusted to act responsibly with guns - just that they have a particular and valid perspective of the issue. For starters they see the results of gun violence and domestic violence more than most.\n \n I did not peg you for one to insult those who serve.\n \n \nYou want to define your meaning of a 'kid'?\n\n \n Legal definition, under 18.\n \n \nBS! A human being learns from both seeing, hearing and doing. That applies to everything. They should have supervised access when training. After that, you propose to put an age limit on responsibility? You jumped from 'kid' now to 'child'. Under brady definitions and other gun grabbers that would mean to 21 years old. \n\n \n The bolded is the key word when it comes to guns and kids. See above for my definition of kid.\n \n \nYep, the old 'aquaintance' trick. Excuses you from having to prove anything except make a statement it happened and how. Got any more stories about how a friend of a friend who had told a friend who told you a story?\n\n \n How about three boys under fifteen being shot outside my home for being in the wrong place at the wrong time when a gang-banger came by with guns ablazing. I got to clean up the blood one of them left behind all over my yard.\n \n Bad things happen when bad or irresponsible people get their hands on guns. I am not saying that is justification for denying second ammendment rights, for I do not believe it is. But can't you enjoy your second ammendment right and still acknowledge these trajedies and support efforts to reduce or stop them?\n \n \nGood idea. Let's make it a pre-requisite for posting on the board too. See we can apply it to all the BOR just to even things out. From what I have seen here on the board, you would be left out and unable to exercise any right.\n\n \n First of all, it was a joke. Secondly, posting on this board does not potentially kill anyone. And finally, I fail to see how me not wanting to own a gun and wishing those who do to be responsible with them indicates a lack of intelligence on my part.\n \n \nYeah, you make all the rules for everyone and add anything you want and see how far you get. emoticon_xbye\n\n \n Once again, see the big bold letters at the top.",

   "jitobear. First off you want special privileges to treat the 2nd Amendment as YOU wish. Then you try to make it seem not so radical by saying But you support the 2nd Amendment. In this way you are as radical as the Special Interest Gun control groups.\n \n Doc said that you make blanket claims, and I agree. That is my objection to what you post. You make it seem like this is an overwhelming epidemic, but then you finally have to admit things like this. \n \n \nMy arguments in all of these forums are about people who are IRRESPONSIBLE with their guns. I know lots of gun owners, and I even believe most are responsible (barring criminals who have guns), however there are some who are not and my condemnation of that irresponsibility stands.\n \n And I am well aware that it is low on the list compared to auto accidents, falls, drownings. But it is still a problem. Too many kids are getting hurt with guns. None should be.\n\n \n Yes. We all do. However, as to the guns and accidents argument, like other daily and household things like autos, swimming pools, lighters, electricity, falls, bicycles etc., we are soft skinned creatures and we live in a dangerous world to us. We ALL wish none of it happened, but you don't seem to be calling for special treatment of any of these other causes of deaths, and they are not even Constitutionally recognized as protected. I wonder how many people would be in jail if we applied your reasoning to everything dangerous. Kitchen implements, poisons, explosives like gasoline, welding gases, and propane etc.\n \n You just seem to want special treatment to something you seem to find objectionable. We as a responsible society are doing the hard work. \n \n  Firearm-Related Fatalities at Record Lows; -- Accidents Among Youths Down Significantly \n NEWTOWN, Conn.-A new report from the National Safety Council shows that accidental firearm-related fatalities remain at record lows, and accidents involving youths continue to decline significantly. \n \n The downward trends are occurring even as firearm ownership rises in the U.S.\n \n Statistics in the council's 2007 \"Injury Facts\" report show a 40 percent decrease in accidental firearm-related fatalities over a 10-year period ending in 2005.\n\n A graphical representation of this good news. http://www.nssf.org/share/images/declinemap.jpg\n \n Do you have any proof that, if we did all you suggested, would even work as you claim it will? Don't you owe it to the Constitution and our people before taking Freedoms that belong to all of us and out future generations? \n \n Freedoms that Doc already showed the actual cost to protect! That being in actual Lives and the blood of our Military Heros? \n \n Does you call for responsibility extend to our Constitution and our Rights that it recognizes as Inalienable? \n \n Or do you just want to take them because that is what you want?",

   "I do not believe this is an example of negligence at all.\n\n \n That would depend on how much latitude the prosecutor has in trying to make a case against open carry.\n \n \nAbout a week back, in Pine County MN, a seven year old and a three year old were left alone with a loaded rifle. The seven year old shot the three year old. That, in my opinion, was negligence - and its stuff like that, preventable things are what I would like to see reduced if not stopped.\n\n \n Was the family able to legally own the rifle in the first place? Or is this a case of a criminal family illegally possessing a firearm, which tends to be common in the big inner cities?\n \n If legality wasn't in question here, I certainly think this is a prime example of why it's best to work on teaching your kids not to play with guns, rather than choosing to leave them ignorant and instead focus your attention on mechanical restrictions.\n \n \nExcuse for what? Expecting responsibility?\n\n \n Simply because something is labeled responsibility doesn't mean that it is. There are times when accidents are unavoidable no matter what precautions you might take. That's why people die in vehicular collisions despite seat belts and air bags.\n \n You stated that you're not interested in statistics. If someone is truly concerned about safety, it makes me wonder why statistics wouldn't be used to try and make a case.\n \n \nI have no idea what they were.\n\n \n You came to this fight ill prepared.\n \n Under DC's old laws, and even under their new laws, you're not allowed to keep an operable gun in your home, under any circumstances. If you own a gun you have to keep it locked up and disassembled, stored in one room of your house, with the ammunition stored in an entirely separate room. You're not allowed to assemble your gun, not even in event of a break in, you're not allowed to load it, or take it from one room of your house to another. \n \n \n[*]Guns out and loaded should be in control and posession of gun-owner/law abiding citizen. If not they should be locked up. Especially if kids are around. I also think guns and being impaired are not a good combination (serious mental health issues, learning disorders, when one is drunk or high).\n\n \n Alright hold the phone. First off, no. A lot of people keep a rifle or shotgun within easy access at home should trouble arise. Under the Heller ruling you can't really expect people to keep them inaccessible to themselves. This especially applies in places like New York and California where carry permits are usually reserved for the rich and famous.\n \n Secondly, learning disorders should play no part on a person's ability to be armed. What even qualifies as a learning disorder in this situation?\n \n \n[*]Kids and guns. If you have kids and guns in the same house, the kids should not be allowed access without supervision, and should also have extension education on gun safety.\n\n \n I see you've changed your previous tune about educating children to practice safety and responsibility on their own.\n \n \nOh, I think they do in many places although they vary from state to state. In general I am comfortable with current gun law. But I admit I get mad when stupid people do stupid stuff with guns and people get hurt.\n\n \n Just because stupid stuff happens, that doesn't mean there are few or no legal repercussions in place. Look at drunk driving for example, it still goes on despite all the laws against such behavior.\n \n If you wanna get mad, get mad at those that're fueling the drug and gang cultures. They're the ones really hurting people, and not in isolated and easily preventable incidents. They're deliberately going out of their way to commit harm to others. Who else would intentionally murder a toddler in a stroller just to make a point?",

   "Just as an aside on the issue of leaving loaded firearms accessible to small children....You don't need a statute aimed only at gun owners. I don't know how it is punished in other states but in Virginia we have a very broad child abuse or neglect statute that we use to prosecute these cases. If death or serious bodily injury occurs, then this portion of the statute applies:\n \n Any parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the care of a child under the age of 18 who by willful act or omission or refusal to provide any necessary care for the child's health causes or permits serious injury to the life or health of such child shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony. For purposes of this subsection, \"serious injury\" shall include but not be limited to (i) disfigurement, (ii) a fracture, (iii) a severe burn or laceration, (iv) mutilation, (v) maiming, (vi) forced ingestion of dangerous substances, or (vii) life-threatening internal injuries.\n \n If the injury is not serious, or even if no injury occurs at all but only the substantial likelihood of injury exists, then this portion of the statute controls:\n \n Any parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the care of a child under the age of 18 whose willful act or omission in the care of such child was so gross, wanton and culpable as to show a reckless disregard for human life shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.\n \n A class 4 felony is punished by 2-10 years imprisonment and a fine of up 100K. A class 6 felony is punished by 1-5 years imprisonment, or jail up to 12 months and a fine of up to $2,500.\n \n Our statute punishes both acts and omissions. A simple example of a willful act would be leaving a loaded revolver in a 3 year old child's toy basket, or leaving a child in an unventilated car for an hour while you go in the store to get the manicure/pedicure in 105 weather in August. By contrast, an \"omission\" is a failure to act. A simple example would be your child falls and suffers a life threatening injury, but you refuse to call for help because you know that if you do then you will be at the ER all night and you just have to stay home because you want to see who will win American Idol tonight. \n \n When you judge whether an act or omission qualifies as a crime under this statute, the following interpretations apply:\n \n \"The term 'willful act' imports knowledge and consciousness that injury will result from the act done. The act done must be intended or it must involve a reckless disregard for the rights of another [that] will probably result in an injury.\" Barrett, 268 Va. at 183, 597 S.E.2d at 111. Thus, the issue of intent requires an examination not only of the act that created the risk, but also of the degree to which the accused \"was [or should have been] aware of the danger\" that resulted from the act. Bean-Brewer v. Commonwealth, 49 Va. App. 3, 11, 635 S.E.2d 680, ___ (2006)\n \n and\n \n A showing of \"inattention and inadvertence,\" i.e., simple negligence, is insufficient to justify the imposition of a criminal penalty. Ellis, 29 Va. App. at 555-56, 513 S.E.2d at 457; see also Commonwealth v. Duncan, 267 Va. 377, 384, 593 S.E.2d 210, 214 (2004). Rather, the negligence must be \"gross negligence\" and must be \"accompanied by acts of commission or omission of a wanton or willful nature, showing a reckless disregard or indifferent disregard of the rights of others, under circumstances reasonably calculated to produce injury, or which make it not improbable that injury will be occasioned, and the offender knows, or is charged with the knowledge of, the probable result of [her] acts.\" Id.\n \n This is just an example of how we deal with this issue in my state.\n \n Now for Galileo....I agree government is necessary to prevent people from violating the rights of others. Thus, a person who commits murder is punished in part because he has denied another's right to life. But government must always be mindful that it is the bull within the china shop of our rights. It is little consolation to me if, in the name of preventing others from denying me my rights, government itself trods upon those same rights in the process. I think the sentiment was best expressed this way: \n \n Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding. Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 485 (1928) (Brandeis, dissenting).\n \n And so while I agree in principle with your \"government is necessary because...\" thought, I also believe that an equally important goal of government is to ensure that government respects our rights in all that it does.\n \n But hey, we are both talking nothing but vague theory here-which is usually what happens on this site because it allows one to escape into varying interpretations if our words are ever used against us. So let's get to some specifics and try to answer the question that started this thread. \n \n As far as sensible gun control laws go, these are not the only gun control laws in my state, but they are the ones we see most often in our courts. I have lived for years with these laws and I have no real problem with them.\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/11357-example-states-firearm-restriction-laws.html\n \n Comment as you feel led.",

   "That would depend on how much latitude the prosecutor has in trying to make a case against open carry.\n\n \n Welcome to justice system. \n \n \nWas the family able to legally own the rifle in the first place? Or is this a case of a criminal family illegally possessing a firearm, which tends to be common in the big inner cities?\n \n If legality wasn't in question here, I certainly think this is a prime example of why it's best to work on teaching your kids not to play with guns, rather than choosing to leave them ignorant and instead focus your attention on mechanical restrictions.\n\n \n The article did not say whether they did, but I assume so since there was nothing in the article regarding charges for having weapons illegally. Pine County is out in the sticks, not the city.\n \n Even if taught not to play with guns, which they very well could have been, it is still foolish to leave children alone with a loaded weapon, especially that young. Kids are curious, willful creatures - that lesson is not a guarantee of their safety. \n \n \nSimply because something is labeled responsibility doesn't mean that it is. There are times when accidents are unavoidable no matter what precautions you might take. That's why people die in vehicular collisions despite seat belts and air bags.\n\n \n Of course. But that does not mean you disregard the things that will reduce those accidents.\n \n \nYou stated that you're not interested in statistics. If someone is truly concerned about safety, it makes me wonder why statistics wouldn't be used to try and make a case.\n\n \n This all stems from why I, me, Leslie, just me chooses not to own a gun. One reason is because it is possible that one can be hurt with their own weapon. People can quibble about the numbers all they want, whether its 2% or 20% does not matter to me and my decision. \n \n \nYou came to this fight ill prepared.\n\n \n The thread asks for my own opinion, I do not need to prep for my opinion.\n \n Also, I'm really not trying to fight anything. Just mystified that expecting gun owners to be responsible or the fact that I choose not to own a gun should cause such an uproar.\n \n \nUnder DC's old laws, and even under their new laws, you're not allowed to keep an operable gun in your home, under any circumstances. If you own a gun you have to keep it locked up and disassembled, stored in one room of your house, with the ammunition stored in an entirely separate room. You're not allowed to assemble your gun, not even in event of a break in, you're not allowed to load it, or take it from one room of your house to another. \n\n \n Thats a stupid law.\n \n \nAlright hold the phone. First off, no. A lot of people keep a rifle or shotgun within easy access at home should trouble arise. Under the Heller ruling you can't really expect people to keep them inaccessible to themselves. This especially applies in places like New York and California where carry permits are usually reserved for the rich and famous.\n\n \n I am not saying that the thing has to be glued to you at all times, just use some common sense and be sure that you are in charge of your weapon when its loaded. If you live in a household of capable adults you trust, leaving a loaded shut gun against the wall is not a problem - but lets say your buddies come over and they are drunk, or strangers show up, or you have a three year old running around - a slightly safer location may not be a bad idea. I am not asking for any restrictions here - just use your head.\n \n And I believe in holding people accountable. If an investigation and trial determines you have been irresonsible with your weapon you should be punished for that. (And I do believe this pretty much happens now anyway.)\n \n Really I gave my three points in my first thread I prett much felt I was stating what was for the most part in place, did not expect people to go all ca ca crazy on me.\n \n \nSecondly, learning disorders should play no part on a person's ability to be armed. What even qualifies as a learning disorder in this situation?\n\n \n A doctor's diagnosis. There are people who have the mental capalities of a three year old. There are people who are severely mentally ill and can not even live alone. They are considered \"vulnerable adults\" I think that allowing some of these vulnerable adults to own a weapon could be even more dangerous than allowing criminals to do so. I think doctors should be the ones who should make such a recomendation to a judge, though.\n \n \nI see you've changed your previous tune about educating children to practice safety and responsibility on their own.\n\n \n No, I have not. I challenge you to show me where I said children should not be educated about guns or their usage. Considering mine has been, you will be pretty hard pressed to do so. Just because such education has been provided does not mean that they should be allowed unfettered access to weapons. I teach my son about automobile safety and operation all the time and have done so for years. This does not mean that I will hand over the car keys, though. He will not be allowed that until he has demonstrated the maturity that he can drive responsibly and he is legally able to do so.\n \n \nJust because stupid stuff happens, that doesn't mean there are few or no legal repercussions in place. Look at drunk driving for example, it still goes on despite all the laws against such behavior.\n\n \n Yes, I know.\n \n \nIf you wanna get mad, get mad at those that're fueling the drug and gang cultures. They're the ones really hurting people, and not in isolated and easily preventable incidents. They're deliberately going out of their way to commit harm to others. Who else would intentionally murder a toddler in a stroller just to make a point?\n\n \n Gangs are part of every day life where I live. Trust me, they XXXX me off plenty.\n \n \n \njitobear You say you don't want to argue statistics or fact. That is just too convenient. It seems that you just want to be rhetorical with no consequences for your statements. Is that being a responsible poster? emoticon_smile I said:\n\n \n See my response to NATO on the stats above.\n \n \nTo this, your answer comes directly out of Left field. \n \n This is the kind of blanket statements, and vague rhetoric that we are objecting to. Who said anything remotely like this? Yet you say that we are brow beating a 2nd Amendment supporter, and possibly turning you off from said support. Not only that, you say Doc is putting words into YOUR mouth? Who said anything like this? \n\n \n What do you mean? 75% of the arguments on the thread stems from you guys being angry about my saying that gun owners should be held accountable should they be negligent with thier weapons and that negligence leads to harm. i.e., In my opinion, the seven year old who shot his three year old brother because they were left alone with a loaded gun, there is an adult that should be held accountable there. \n \n \nDoc repeatedly, and now Bryan have shown you that what you ask is already in practice, but yet you appear to want to ignore those laws and facts, and just keep harping on this as if this were a major problem that needs to be fixed!

If this didn't cover your argument, what additional laws do you want! What would it say! Time for you to defend your argument!\n\n \n I listed three things I want, I have acknowledged that they are pretty much in place. As I stated to NATO I when I originally posted I knew that and did not expect anyone to go all ape-$hit over my post.",

   "jitobear, you have had your say and we have responded. It is pointless to continue this part of the dialog further. The one thing I have learned about you is that discussing things with you is pointless because you ignore facts and statistic and just emote your seeming distrust for us and firearms. That is your decision, and your decisions may be right for you, and still have no basis of fact in reality. \n \n However, on the subject of kids around guns.\n \n When I was growing up, my friends and I were taught the proper respect for dangerous items like Knives, Electricity, Playing in the street, looking both ways before crossing the street, and yes even guns. \n \n My father taught me that I could look at and handle his firearms whenever I wanted just as long as he was there and I asked his permission first. A huge emphasis on ANY TIME I WANTED! There was zero mystery about firearms when I was growing up, we were all taught pretty much the same thing. \n \n I was 13 when I got my first shotgun. My father took me hunting and to the range where he taught me safe handling of firearms, and the respect for the awesome power of a firearm to destroy a life. This is a privilege that I don&#8217;t EVER want you to take lightly, he said. You are now on notice of these things, and we all acted responsibly. When I turned 16 I also had a rifle and a handgun! I earned them, and earned the right to have them by my responsible actions, of never pointing a firearm at anything I was not willing to destroy, even if I knew for a fact that the guns were not loaded.   And here are the other rules.  \n \n Now you may think this is stupid but I don&#8217;t care what you think. emoticon_smile I know the discussions my friends and I had about safety and responsibility. You do not! This was the Supreme badge of the Responsibility and maturity for us and to violate this would be an unthinkable act! And in fact, when I heard my first burglar, I walked by a wall full of guns to get a butcher knife, because that was An Extremely unthinkable act! That is how well that was ingrained in us.\n \n While I was still 17 for a few days, the U.S. Army trained a bunch of 17,18,19 year old and had no fear of giving them weapons and ammo. So what does the Army do to make that kind of difference? Training.",

But I ask the same courtesy (for all citizens) which is why mandatory gun ownership ticks me off.\n \n \nYou do need to reinforce your opinion so it can withstand the criticisms raised over its shortcomings.\n\n \n Why? Either my opinion will change or it won't.\n \n \nYour definition of responsibility isn't universal.\n\n \n Nobody's definition of anything is, but to llive in a managable society of laws a legal definition needs to be in place. Somewhere in between the useless DC law and and being able to point and shoot at will.\n \n \nAdults aren't capable of doing stupid things?\n\n \n All too often.\n \n \nThen they'd be in trouble with the law, not me.\n\n \n But this would be one those times you can pretty much count on them to do something stupid, so I wouldn't let them play with my gun - but thats just me.\n \n \nBreaking and entering, a criminal offense. Against they'd be in trouble, not me.\n\n \n I am not talking about that - I am talking that they knock on the door, cable guy, etc. - someone that you may not know or be able to trust but may have access to your home. \n \n \nEasily accessible doesn't mean out in the open in full view of everyone.\n\n \n Agreed.\n \n \nThen why aren't you suggesting the same standards for gangster wannabees?\n\n \n What are you talking about? Anyone who owns a gun legally should be expected to responsible with it, anyone who owns one illegally should be prosecuted. Wannabes who do not have weapons and don't break the law may be obnoxious but are hardly something I am going to fret about.\n \n I am hardly fuzzy wuzzy about gangsters. They are a serious problem where I live.\n \n \nThose aren't learning disorders, they're developmental disorders. \n\n \n OK, I stand corrected. Or serious mental health disorders (i.e., schizophrenia).\n \n \nDoctors can be wrong too. Look at how many kids are on Ritalin and similar drugs, and they're just in preschool.\n\n \n I agree that small children are over-medicated for ADD or ADHD and it is hard to diagnose children. (I believe Adderal is the drug of choice for children with ADHD now, much more low-key than Ritalin.)\n \n This is not the case for adults. The seriously mentally have serious symptoms that are unmistakably a problem - spend ten minutes with a decompensating schizophrenic and you will see what I mean. (I used to be a mental health working in Dakota County.)\n \n \nIt's done when you argue that mechanical restrictions are a better option than educating the children so they can exercise their own safety.\n\n \n I support a combination of the two. \n \n \nAnd what did their education consist of?\n\n \n Just one kid. A class taught by the MN DNR on gun and hunting safety. He also does all his shooting and hunting with my cousin Bill and/or my brother. My brother is a trained police officer and my cousin a 20+ safe and experienced gun owner and instructor for the DNR. My son is not allowed unsupervised access to any gun except his pellet gun.\n \n \nNobody really suggested such in this thread.\n\n \n It was implied in the outraged response that gun owners be held accountable if they are negligent.",

His father and I have driven ourselves mad and lost sleep trying to conjur up new ways to get this very bright and capable child motivated. He's still a lazy bugger.\n \n You can't control anyone. Not even children. Children are not adults, you can't trust that they will handle grown up stuff (like cars, property management, complete self-reliance, guns) like a grown up.\n \n \n \n I am not saying how to be a safe gun-owner, just be one, use your head and take reponsibility for your weapon (not saying you are not, speaking hypothetically here).\n \n \n \n I teach them they are sharp and I keep them out of reach. I tell them medicine is not candy and keep it out of reach and in child-proof containers. When my son went through a phase where he was burning little peices of paper for entertainment I chewed him out, disciplined him AND hid the matches.\n \n \n \n True. You can only do what you can do. (Combination locks are probably better.) \n \n \n \n Yep. Still not going to own a gun. I have many reasons for that decision.\n \n \n \n I'm not. I have said several times I support people's right to own a gun. But I ask the same courtesy (for all citizens) which is why mandatory gun ownership ticks me off.\n \n \n \n Why? Either my opinion will change or it won't.\n \n \n \n Nobody's definition of anything is, but to llive in a managable society of laws a legal definition needs to be in place. Somewhere in between the useless DC law and and being able to point and shoot at will.\n \n \n \n All too often.\n \n \n \n But this would be one those times you can pretty much count on them to do something stupid, so I wouldn't let them play with my gun - but thats just me.\n \n \n \n I am not talking about that - I am talking that they knock on the door, cable guy, etc. - someone that you may not know or be able to trust but may have access to your home. \n \n \n \n Agreed.\n \n \n \n What are you talking about? Anyone who owns a gun legally should be expected to responsible with it, anyone who owns one illegally should be prosecuted. Wannabes who do not have weapons and don't break the law may be obnoxious but are hardly something I am going to fret about.\n \n I am hardly fuzzy wuzzy about gangsters. They are a serious problem where I live.\n \n \n \n OK, I stand corrected. Or serious mental health disorders (i.e., schizophrenia).\n \n \n \n I agree that small children are over-medicated for ADD or ADHD and it is hard to diagnose children. (I believe Adderal is the drug of choice for children with ADHD now, much more low-key than Ritalin.)\n \n This is not the case for adults. The seriously mentally have serious symptoms that are unmistakably a problem - spend ten minutes with a decompensating schizophrenic and you will see what I mean. (I used to be a mental health working in Dakota County.)\n \n \n \n I support a combination of the two. \n \n \n \n Just one kid. A class taught by the MN DNR on gun and hunting safety. He also does all his shooting and hunting with my cousin Bill and/or my brother. My brother is a trained police officer and my cousin a 20+ safe and experienced gun owner and instructor for the DNR. My son is not allowed unsupervised access to any gun except his pellet gun.\n \n \n \n It was implied in the outraged response that gun owners be held accountable if they are negligent.\n\n \n OK Leslie, let's get down to what you are saying that conflicts with what you claim you are saying. Sounds innocent enough AT FIRST BLUSH, but it drew Bryan's attention as it does my diagnosis...repeatedly I might add much to your discontent and I am going to show you why...again. I have to assume you are an intelligent and reasonable and responsible person because you keep telling me you are. You keep assuring folks that all we have to do is accept your definition of \"responsible\" which shifts from your claim that \"all you want to do is prevent sales to the bad guys\" and then morph into your \"willfully negligent\" and \"legal responsibility\" credo. ...all of which is directed as a means for some type of legislative loophole and backdoor gun control and you are far from your claim that you \"just don't want the 'bad guys' to have guns\" then you embark an epithet in search of a definition, i.e. RESPONSIBLE, WILLFULLY NEGLIGENT AND LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY. There is no justification for using intrusive definitions that would render gun ownership insecure and deterring ownership by backdoor government coercion. Your attempt to switch horses from \"bad guys\" to broad definitions which would render 2A rights insecure by further intrusion by definition of what you call the \"justice system\" or 'community standards' or whatever else bureaucrats may deem desireable.\n \n You prove my point here: \nAnd further - I am not asking for any laws that would limit a law abiding citizen's access to guns. I do not support them. Just legal repercussions if WILFULL NEGLIGENCE leads to harm.\n \n \n Methinks the lady? protests too much. Lucky for us, women don't know when to shut their pie hole. The 2A says absolutely nothing about \"a law abiding citizens' access to guns\" except that the right SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED. i COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE YOU CONTINUE TO USE CITIZEN's as a singular possessive. Freudian slip?\n \n You again attempt to portray your forgotten assertion \"that all you want is to not sell to bad guys\" and morph into your real credo: \nHaving the right to a gun should not automatically negate responsibility.\n\n \n Despite having been shown existing law covers your claimed wants, it is obvious you want to expand a epithet which you are obviously not satisfied with and wish to leave the barn door open for further speculative definition to make it mean whatever the he double l you or some burrocrat or special interest group wants it to mean. \"see,\" as you stomp your little feet, \"now the bad guys don't have guns\" but there are still some \"bad guys\" out there that do have guns and we need more \"responsibility and someone else to be legally responsible\" so, as a government continues to violate the ultimate law of the land.\n \n That my dear, is what is wrong with your attempt at subversion, perversion and attempt to deceive. Shame your poor attempt at manipulation didn't work isn't it. You even share your family life with us to garner sympathy and portray yourself as a poor put upon mother just interested in GUN SAFETY which is not mentioned in the 2A. Like the Good Book, ye shall not add to nor take away!! It is so slick it probably was a thought of the hellion, Rebecca Peters or some such wild eyed shirker.\n \n Your retreat is always to the simple claim of bad guys = no guns but your speil belies your safe harbour and I am stuck in your craw!! and you can't spit me out :)\n \n You really should be more responsible and accept that responsibility for the safety of yourself and family without willfully shirking your legal responsibility to protect their and your own lives. That is every bit as damming as what you portray in your definition as: \n\"I feel this way about ANY kind of willful negligence - driving dangerously or under the influence, leaving babies unattended in bath tubs, leaving electricals open to water, running a furnace you know is emitting kill levels of CO2, letting a toddler play alone by a campfire, etc.\"\n but you stumble when it comes to actually protecting them from predators, sex offenders, gang members etc. simply because you refuse to use the tool most fit for the job and insist that others adopt your definition (which is but an epithet searching for a definition).",
