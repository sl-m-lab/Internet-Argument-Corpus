   "Another day, another shooting, in the good old gun-crazy US of A:\n \nSuspect kills self in Ohio State shooting, police say\n March 9, 2010 11:58 a.m. EST\n (CNN) -- A man apparently angry over a poor performance evaluation entered an Ohio State University maintenance building early Tuesday and opened fire, killing a manager before turning the gun on himself, police said.\n \n Larry Wallington, 48, a building services manager at the OSU Maintenance Building, was pronounced dead at the scene of the 3:30 a.m. ET shooting, Ohio State University Police Chief Paul Denton said. Wallington was a 10-year university employee, he said.\n \n Authorities found suspect Nathaniel Brown, 51, a custodial worker, suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot at the scene, Denton said. He was transported to the Ohio State University Medical Center, where he was dead on arrival.\n \n Police believe Brown -- a probational employee since October who had received a poor performance review -- entered the building dressed in dark clothing carrying two handguns and began firing into an office suite, Denton said. Officials would not say when Brown received the review, who gave it to him or provide further details, citing the ongoing investigation.\n\n Suspect kills self in Ohio State shooting, police say - CNN.com\n \n Workers' Rights as sponsored by the NRA.",

Picking out anacronisms to garner support for whatever cause you support is so weak it is not a blip on the radar screen and could be easily solved by adherence to the Constitution.

Evidently your interest lagged and you didn't read his pedigree nor his past criminal history. A 'gun crazy' misses all of that in their haste to point fingers meanwhile overlooking the myriad of gun laws studied by CDC and the NAS found no benefit of any of them but here you are beating the drum calling for more of the same innefective nonsense and avoiding your responsibility to protect yourself, family and property and a third person as well. You completely shun the fact that the police have NO DUTY to protect you nor anyone else. Now that is not only 'gun crazy' but pure, unadultrated loon behavior.

   "Within the criminal justice system traffic and gun laws are very similar. This is because the purpose of the criminal justice system is to punish the guilty without harming the rights of the innocent. For crimes involving weapons-be it a bat, a brick, a pipe, or a gun-we do not excuse or minimize a person's criminal conduct by blaming the sword for the hand that wields it. We hold those who are a fault accountable-the person who chose to commit a wrongful act through an unjustifiable motive, be it anger, hatred, revenge, greed, etc. We hold accountable the person who knew right from wrong, who understood the nature and consequences of his actions, and who made a conscious choice to violate the law-in the case of murder the person who deliberately chose to take someone's life without a shred of legitimate excuse or justification.\n \n Likewise, when a man kills or maims by driving recklessly or while intoxicated we don't blame the truck he drove or the Johnny Walker he drank. We don't lament America's love affair with SUVs or infatuation with bourbon. We don't seek to ban cars or bring back prohibition. And so within the criminal justice system traffic and guns laws are treated similarly. We blame the criminal, and we prosecute him for his crime. No one demands, for example, that I surrender the beer in my fridge because another person just killed someone while driving drunk-under the theory that his crime means I cannot be trusted to have beer anymore. \n \n It is here, on this blog site, that we see people abandon reasons and common sense to play this blame game. Here the actions of a criminal become the springboard to attack an object one fears-and those who refuse to share that fear.",

The prosecution alleged that Client and two friends broke into one home, stole jewelry and the car in the garage. They then allegedly drove to Client's uncle's house, where they stole 9 firearms that had been locked up in the home. Client gave a full confession to breaking into the first home.

How do you get tighter than 100% forbidden?\n \n Anyone care to state the definition of insanity for posterity?\n\n Insanity= gun control to put it simple or at least gun control the way THEY want it.emoticon_xkill",

My jurisdiction is somewhat rural, has a strong tradition of responsible individual firearm ownership, and a much lower crime rate than the large cities in my state. I am very happy to report that by and large the officers I work with support gun rights and have no problem with people having and lawfully using guns.\n\n \n Yep, the last part is the problem. We have laws governing murder and crimes. In Heller Scalia mentioned State Constitutions that had provisions for \"subject to law\" not unlike England once had and we know where that ended up. That is not a reasonable level of scrutiny on a Civil Right. Don't forget that! That is the problem now in many States, even ones that have fairly loose gun laws and we know the law that strict States have.\n \n Prosecutors have been part of the problem, like Rosenthal in Houston who refused to abide by State Law and ordered officers to continue on as always, confiscating guns from travelers and trying to press charges on self-defense incidents.\n \n It is no secret Bryan, that a prosecutor with the hand picked grand jury can indict a head of cabbage. I once asked you to explore the 'free exercise' of a civil right in context with the First Amendment. It was a hot topic at the time and still is. I am sure you mean well but let's not get careless. We have enough bad judges that are sure to use any law to their advantage on political belief and stances as we do prosecutors.\n \n That is the main reason I want to see Slaughterhouse overturned and the 2A incorporated in/by/with the P or I clause. Of Course, under both that and the due process would be fine too. :)",

   "QOUTE]The NRA and Gun Owner versus the Brady Campaign and Gun Opponents: Who Serves America Better \n Which group has contributed more to America and our way of life? Who has contributed more to our overall well-being? Is it the National Rifle Association and the gun owners throughout America or the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and those who believe that gun ownership is dangerous for Americans?\n \n The National Rifle Association\n \n The National Rifle Association was formed in 1871 by two Union officers who were astounded at the poor marksmanship demonstrated by the Union troops. Union veterans Col. William C. Church and Gen. George Wingate were granted a charter by the state of New York on November 17th, 1871 and General Ambrose Burnside, former Governor of Rhode Island became the first president of the NRA. They obtained funding help from New York, and bought the Creed Farm on Long Island. The new firing range was named Creedmoor. It was not long before opposition began to form and in 1892 the range was moved from Creedmoor to Sea Girt, New Jersey. In 1903 the NRA Secretary, Albert S. Jones urged the establishment of rifle clubs at all major colleges, universities and military academies and began promoting shooting sports for youths, inspiring a new generation of Americans who would be able to defend our nation in the event of war. Repeated attacks on our Second Amendment rights led the NRA to form the Legislative Affairs Division in 1934. The NRA did not lobby directly at this time; rather it mailed out legislative facts and analyses to members so they could take action on their own. Its main mission remained training of citizens in marksmanship and gun safety.\n \n Serving America During Wartime\n \n During World War Two, the NRA allowed the government to use its ranges and developed training materials in the use and care of firearms for the military. NRA members were encouraged to volunteer as plant and home guard members. The Association also developed training materials for industrial security and even reloaded ammunition for those guarding war plants. Internationally, the NRA recognized the desperate circumstances Britain had put itself in by effectively disarming itself through well intentioned but poorly considered gun laws enacted between WWI and WWII. The NRA collected and sent to Britain more than 7,000 firearms for their defense against potential invasion by Germany [in spite of this unprecedented generosity of a civilian group to a foreign nation, Britain remained such a staunch opponent of private gun ownership that instead of expressing their appreciation to the NRA members and returning those firearms, they were unceremoniously dumped into the ocean at wars end]. Currently members of the NRA are providing supplemental weapons training to our troops in preparation for their deployment in Iraq.\n \n Serving America During Peacetime\n \n Through the years, the NRA has provided firearms training to tens of thousands of policemen throughout America. The NRA estimates that there are more than 10,000 NRA certified police and security instructors in America today. Hundreds of thousands of police, sheriffs, state troopers, federal marshals, FBI, Treasury Agents, and various security agents owe their proficiency at arms either directly or indirectly to the efforts of the NRA. There are over 50,000 Certified Instructors in the civilian population and according to the NRA these instructors train over 750,000 private gun owners each year. They are provided training in how to use and maintain rifles, shotguns, and pistols as well as providing concealed carry training in those states which offer licensing. Instruction in personal defense and competitions shooting are offered. They also provide safety instruction to hunters of all ages. One of the most successful programs has been the \"Eddie Eagle\" program which educates children from pre-kindergarten to the sixth grade in how to behave when they come upon a firearm in an unsupervised situation. They are taught quite simply \"STOP. DON'T TOUCH. LEAVE THE AREA. TELL AN ADULT. So far more than 18,000,000 children have been given this training. The sad thing is that far more children could have received this training had not the hate mongers in the anti-gun organizations lied about the intentions of the NRA.\n \n Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence\n \n The Brady Campaign began life as the National Council to Control Handguns, established in 1974 by Dr. Mark Borinsky, \"a victim of gun violence.\" The Next year, following the murder of his son, DuPont executive Nelson \"Pete\" Shields takes a leave of absence from his job to work for NCCH and in 1978 became the organizations chairman. In 1980 NCCH was renamed HCI, Handgun Control, Inc. In 1983, The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence (CPHV), an educational outreach organization dedicated to reducing gun violence, is founded as a sister organization to HCI. In 1985, four years after her husband Jim Brady, Ronald Reagan's press secretary, was wounded in the assassination attempt by John Hinckley, Jr. Sarah Brady joined the anti-gun movement and in 1989 became the chair Handgun Control, Inc. Later in 1991 she also became chair of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence. On June 14th, 2001 HCI was renamed the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the CPHV was renamed Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, both in honor of Jim and Sarah's commitment to make America safer from gun violence.\n \n Legislative Achievements of the Brady Campaign\n \n With the high profile Sarah Brady at the head of their campaign, between 1985 and 1991 the HCI/CPHV had a number of legislative successes. They successfully lobbied Congress to ban Teflon coated armor-piercing, \"cop-killer\" bullets that can puncture bullet-proof vests worn by police officers and in Maryland they were able to pass a ban on the sale of so-called Saturday Night Specials. Problem is, there were no \"cop-killer\" bullets. The Teflon coating is common to most ammunition, because it causes less wear on the barrel, reduces ricochets from hard surfaces, and reduces air contamination from lead particles being shed from bullets in flight. As to \"Saturday Night Special,\" there has never been any evidence that these inexpensive guns are in anyway more dangerous to the user, or that they are used any more frequently in committing a crime than any other firearm. The two organizations managed to get Congress to pass a bill to ban handguns that cannot be detected by airport x-ray machines (\"plastic\" handguns). The only problem with these laws is that they were so-called feel good laws, which protected no one. There have never been any \"plastic\" handguns. The guns which so terrified the CPHV and HCI (the Glock) are now the most commonly used firearms by police in the nation. The Glock was never \"plastic\" and was never \"undetectable\" by airport x-ray machines, being 80% metal as they are. The Glock was the victim, as are so many weapon systems, of hyperventilating by these Left-wing organizations. The same, identical Glock, unchanged in any way, is still being marketed in the United States, and is one of the most popular firearms sold because of their inherent safety and reliability.\n \n Much More Ado About Nothing\n \n After a schoolyard massacre in Stockton, California passes the first assault weapons ban in the nation, the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapon Act. This act would later lead to the Violent Crime and Control Act of 1994, which includes the first-ever federal Assault Weapons Ban, banning the future manufacture and importation of military-style assault weapons. By admission of the authors of the bill, the criteria used in deciding whether or not a gun was included on the list were cosmetic. If a gun \"looked\" dangerous or bad, it was included on the list. Again, as is typical of Left-wing legislation, superficialities were the deciding factors. No effort was made to determine the functionality of firearms, so you could and did have cases in which one of two identically functioning guns which had different stocks or features would be on the ban and the other would be perfectly acceptable. In 1993, Virginia passed legislation limiting purchases of guns to \"one per person per month,\" in response to claims by the anti-gun lobby that Virginia is a source state of crime guns trafficked up and down the East Coast. In spite of passing of this law, gun violence on the East Coast has shown no sign of lessening.\n \n One of the few constructive and successful laws to come out of the Brady Campaign, is the instant background check. The Brady Bill, which requires a five-day waiting period and background checks on handgun purchases, was signed into law after a seven-year battle, and went into effect in the 32 states which had no background check system. The Brady Bill was sunsetted and while it was in effect, a system for instant background checks was set in place. As the Brady five-day law came to an end, the instant check system was implemented. In some states, there is now no waiting period. In most cases, this kind of success is absent. Most legislation lobbied for by the Anti-gun movement turns out to be ineffectual, superficial, and counter productive. A lot of the efforts of the Brady Campaign revolve around what sounds good rather than what is true. Much of the data supplied by the Brady campaign is apocryphal, assumed to be true with no supporting data, or just plane false presented as true using twisted data. Programs like Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine present a distorted view of gun owners, firearms manufacturers, and American culture. The anti-gun faction continue to mis-portray the NRA and its members as dangerous, supporting weapons systems which are dangerous for police and attempting to corrupt children through its Eddie Eagle Program. The truth is that the Eddie Eagle Program expresses no opinion as to whether guns are good or bad or whether gun ownership is good or bad. In contrast the anti-gun lobby continually represents guns as more dangerous to owners than the criminals they are meant to deter. Their STAR program does place the Campaigns own opinions on gun ownership in all of its literature. No attempt at objectivism is made.\n \n The Results of the Comparison \n \n The NRA continues to represent a positive influence in our society. It seeks to inform rather than sway. Allegations by the Brady Campaign that the NRA promotes weapon systems dangerous to police and other government enforcement agencies don't match the evidence. It is ludicrous to make such assertions, when so much of the NRA's efforts are directed at supporting our law enforcement officers, providing them with training and information to assist them in the execution of their duties. The NRA projects a positive image of the gun owner, and documents its claims with news reports from the very media sources which attempt to undermine the organization. Like most Liberal organizations, the Brady Campaign presents a negative image of gun owners and of guns in general. They appear to be more concerned with the safety of the criminal than they are the victim and are pre-occupied by their fear and hatred for firearms. Virtually all of their claims are base on assumptions which are not supported by facts. They have contributed little to protect the public let alone the Law enforcement agencies and their personnel. They have done nothing to support our troops in combat situations, or our police in their day to day duties. By vilifying firearms rather than perpetrators, they undermine our efforts to combat criminals. They distort or misconstrue the meaning of the Second Amendment to support their belief in the complete disarmament of American citizens. They embrace the kind of restrictive gun ownership laws which can be found in Great Britain. There is an utter failure to address the glaring problems in their argument in favor of gun control, such as why the Swiss, who have the most liberal gun laws in Europe, including the possession by every able bodied citizen of a fully automatic \"assault weapon,\" has the lowest crime rate in Europe, and Britain which has the most restrictive laws, while having a low death rate, has one of the highest violent crime rates in the world.\n \n Ultimately, the comparison is ludicrous. The NRA has, since its inception, \"moved mountains\" in supporting American troops, in supporting our policemen, and in promoting and defending the freedoms of the American citizen. The anti-gun movement has sought to undermine one of our most basic freedoms and rights, the right to defend oneself, and has sought to impair, by indirect means, the ability of our nation to defend itself. The Brady campaign by vilifying millions of law abiding gun owners, by releasing propaganda based on faulty research, and by attempting to restrict access by law abiding citizens to firearms has lent its name to efforts to destroy or at least weaken our Constitution and Bill of Rights. It is organizations like the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence that represent the real threat to Americans and their freedom.[/QUOTE]",

   "SITUATIONAL AWARENESS: a fiction at law...\n \n So let us assume for argument slick that you have a somewhat valid complaint on unwarranted exposure and 4th amendment intrusion by LEOs on mere suspicions that some gun owners are selling guns to criminals and not reporting them as stolen although that is NOT the law of the land. We will rank your stance, no matter how perverted it may be, to Waco and the claim by BATF(e) that the feds were intervening in a wholly State matter by desparately and initially claiming after the first gunfire that there were children being abused at the Waco Church. A similar raid was completed at the Morman property near Eldorado, Texas recently with similar claims and resulting fiasco.\n \n Now for whatever sick motive you have for your hard on for gun owners exercising their civil liberties and making it difficult any way you can, let's put the shoe on the other foot.\n \n You have a son. Right? At least you said you did several times on this board. It is well known you have no objections to illicit drugs and in fact your state allows for medical use and doesn't prosecute small amounts which means if you use drugs you have to depend on a dealer which in turn means you help fund the drug cartel in Mexico and other countries that supply those drugs or else you depend on their manufacture here, in kalifornia. IOW, you are supporting criminals and their behavior and life style and encouraging lawlesness with the idea you are within the law because you never buy more than the legal amount and have no desire to turn in your friendly neighborhood perp because that would end your supply. You conveniently dismiss the fact that your supplier is armed and knows that some, if not all his customers have to steal to support their habit and that includes firearms. Instead of the problem, you look to the nearest folks to draw attention away from the true situation and choose to point the finger at gun owners and the fiction that they sell to these criminals so ergo there needs to be a law to punish these folks exercising their ability to protect themselves from your buddies so you choose sides and go with the criminal because they have what you want...drugs. [ I could go on and draw a prettier picture here if you like]\n \n Bear with me here! Let us assume that the folks you have been laying all the sins of kalifornia on decide to fight fire with fire and adopt your tactics of a \"clean hands policy\" that you approve of. After all, it isn't you is it? It is the law.\n \n Now another neighbor, old slim gunowner, across the holler from you sees through squinted eyes what you are doing and decides to report your *** to CPS. They just show up at your door backed by the swat team to tear hell out of your house looking for drugs and CPS is there to take your son away in State custody to be \"safe\". You have no means to appeal, your house is a shambles, your son is gone to who knows where and your bank accounts have been frozen. The SWAT team found some drugs, a few guns you claimed not to own [maybe you did or didn't but they were there whether planted or not] and you are put in jail, have no friends now, and await a 1517 magistration and hope you can get out on personal recognizance which you do but the bail amount is for $100,000 and knowing nothing about the law you try to proceed with your daily life and put things back together again. You know better than to \"go tell the prosecutor\" because it is a case before him now and he can't discuss it. He is bound to prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law and he \"ain't your buddy\". You can't afford to hire a lawyer because your bank accounts are frozen pending the investigation and outcome of the case. You don't know your rights nor how to file for an evidenciary hearing and you can't find your son or talk to him. Time passes and at work one day a couple of folks dressed in black come to arrest you and handcuff you in front of your co-workers. \n \n You are arrested and formally charged and this time you have to come up with at least $10,000 dollars cash and maybe $30,000 to make bail so you can get out. You try to call friends but they want nothing to do with an \"accused criminal\". You ask the friendly jailer to 'get the judge to appoint you a lawyer' and he laughs and tells you the Judge will appoint you one when you are formally charged in court..., (this time with indictment from the Grand Jury), .. if you can't afford one that is. For arguments sake, let's assume you are appointed a lawyer. You don't get your choice, you get what you get. The county pays his fees and he is not going to devote a lot of time to your case, pro bono...but you are out of jail anyway. You go down to the sheriff's office to bit** about CPS taking your child away so the sheriff arrests you again for disturbing the peace or touching a police officer and you wind up in the pokey again, same old scene all over again, \"deja vu\". You finally get out on personal recognizance. You lost your house, your son, your money and you stand an accused felon, no friends no nothing, you don't even have a gun to commit suicide so you look for a piece of rope which you don't have either. You are depressed, no one to talk to so you go for a stroll and find yourself over a busy interstate on the overpass and jump into the oncoming traffic.\n \n The moral of the story is those who stir **** often find themselves in **** and to the conquoror goes the spoils. The only defense you can mutter are the words, \"but I tried to stop criminals from getting guns by punishing all gun owners\"\n \n This is what I see you trying to force on others so now you await a visit from CPS :) See how it works? We will just call this, \"sinjin's turn in the barrel\"!!!",

Encumber the exercise of a right and punish those who exercise their civil rights any way he/they can. He detests and protests actions he has applauded when they are turned on him. Scared him so much he wants to ignore how law can be abused although if he is the abuser and someone elses' rights are being abused simply because he doesn't like them, then that is great, just and fitting. He is bound to be dissapointed time after time beginning in April :) A practicing psychiatrist would probably be able to put a name on the illness we describe as 'hoplophobia\". HT to Jeff Cooper. He is one sick puppy and really needs to get help before something serious happens with his deep seated despise for the 2A and those who exercise those rights. He is so irrational he actually believes those claims he made until you pointed out how wrong they were. Course a drowning man will clutch at a straw to stay afloat as he does to try to maintain credibility by repeating your post as his own to preserve his ego. Myself, I just mock him with the Constitution and he can't deal with the Supreme Law of the Land :)\n He is so ashamed he is even advertising that he has me on ignore :) \n \n \nI know when dealing with a Constitutional Right, laws must be meager and specifically tailored not to infringe on the right nor the spirit of that right. That is why this law in Ohio is totally worthless.\n\n \n So does any right thinking individual. If they could all be like Bryan...having their duty before them...and their oath of office!\n Good post Bryan!\n \n Now what I want to know is: when the right which the Supreme Court decided in Heller is an individual right is deemed 'incorporated' it has always been an individual right. Will the rights that were trampled on previously by Courts and States and local governments be retroactive? Just as Castillo ruled that any enhanced sentence must be found by a jury and not just the Judge/court and overturned many gun laws and knocked 15 years off the sentence of Branch Davidians. IOW, will those who were persecuted under unjust laws be released, pardoned and paid for false imprisonment and civil rights violations?",

Thankfully!!!\n\n \n Slick keeps pretending there is no Constitutional civil right ergo all gun owners should be punished anyway possible. Let's look at the text of the civil rights bills for some clues.\n \n \n505 U.S. 833 \n \n PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN \n PENNSYLVANIA, ET AL. v. \n CASEY, GOVERNOR OF PENNSYLVANIA, ET AL., CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT Nos. 91-744 \n \n \n Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects. See U.S. Const., Amdt. 9. As the second Justice Harlan recognized: \n \n [T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This \"liberty\" is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; [I]the right to keep and bear arms[/U]; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints, . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment. Poe v. [505 U.S. 833, 849] Ullman, supra, 367 U.S., at 543 (dissenting from dismissal on jurisdictional grounds). \n \n Justice Harlan wrote these words in addressing an issue the full Court did not reach in Poe v. Ullman, but the Court adopted his position four Terms later in Griswold v. Connecticut, supra. In Griswold, we held that the Constitution does not permit a State to forbid a married couple to use contraceptives. That same freedom was later guaranteed, under the Equal Protection Clause, for unmarried couples. See Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972). Constitutional protection was extended to the sale and distribution of contraceptives in Carey v. Population Services International, supra. It is settled now, as it was when the Court heard arguments in Roe v. Wade, that the Constitution places limits on a State's right to interfere with a person's most basic decisions about family and parenthood, see Carey v. Population Services International, supra; Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494 (1977); Eisenstadt v. Baird, supra; Loving v. Virginia, supra; Griswold v. Connecticut, supra; Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U.S. 535 (1942); Pierce v. Society of Sisters, supra; Meyer v. Nebraska, supra, as well as bodily integrity, see, e.g., Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 221 -222 (1990); Winston v. Lee, 470 U.S. 753 (1985); Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165 (1952).\n \n \n Nope, no breathing room for slick there. Time to call CPS :)",

   "[ Footnote * ] The Court said in full about this right of privacy: \n \n \"The principles laid down in this opinion [by Lord Camden in Entick v. Carrington, 19 How. St. Tr. 1029] affect the very essence of constitutional liberty and security. They reach farther than the concrete form of the case then before the court, with its adventitious circumstances; they apply to all invasions on the part of the government and its employes of the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life. It is not the breaking of his doors, and the rummaging of his drawers, that constitutes the essence of the offence; but it is the invasion of his indefeasible right of personal security, personal liberty and private property, where that right has never been forfeited by his conviction of some public offence, - it is the invasion of this sacred right which underlies and constitutes the essence of [381 U.S. 479, 485] Lord Camden's judgment. Breaking into a house and opening boxes and drawers are circumstances of aggravation; but any forcible and compulsory extortion of a man's own testimony or of his private papers to be used as evidence to convict him of crime or to forfeit his goods, is within the condemnation of that judgment. In this regard the Fourth and Fifth Amendments run almost into each other.\" 116 U.S., at 630 .\n[/QUOTE]\n \n \n Griswold was one of the worst blights on the American justice system, IMO.

Or is it more like 1 to 10, if that at all? And, is that part of the law, Should have known, used much? If so, how many did it apply to, or is it actually superfluous, not being used at all?

Can you please find that out for us? \n \n I think that is only fair since you would like this to be the Law of the Land. \n \n However, I have a burning question, how does one in authority in CT. determine when one should have known the gun was stolen. Problematic no? I wonder how the 5th Amendment could apply in this situation? \n \n And, what kind of punishment do you think is appropriate for him/her? Your link prescribes a fine of 90 bucks.

   " Prevent might be too optimistic. I'd go with deter given an increasing penalty for subsequent convictions \n\n \n Are you talking about preventing illegal transfers to prohibited persons, or just prosecuting victims of crime who fail to report the crime?\n \n \n I disagree. Firstly, they didn't make a report unless one counts a verbal one given to LE when questioned. Hence time limits and/or \"should have knowns\". Trying to prove their theft report false would be a waste of effort IMO. If you have actual evidence of an illegal transfer, you'd do well to concentrate on that case.\n \n Evidence of an intentional illegal transfer seems quite hard to come by, wouldn't you say? No witnesses and built in deniability even if the weapon surfaces, i.e. \"I guess it was stolen\"; \"I sold it to some guy\". \n\n \n Yes, absent a confession in my experience they are hard to prosecute. \n \n \n Assisting in that prosecution is the function you've assigned the law and then deemed it powerless. \n\n \n Then what function do you assign to it? I read your previous comment \n \n \n Yes, because people who give/sell firearms to prohibited persons can presently claim the gun was stolen after it turns up at a crime scene and LE can't touch them. \n\n \n to be an argument that these mandatory theft reporting laws were needed to deter those who knowingly provide firearms to prohibited persons on the secondary market. Was I wrong in assuming this?\n \n \n But without such a law, LE must go to every first owner expecting to hear the gun was sold or stolen and that's all she wrote. A reporting law would mostly eliminate the legitimate thefts from having to be investigated. \n\n \n Is this then the goal you advocate, what is essentially a registration of lost or stolen firearms to assist police in investigations of recovered weapons? That would be something else entirely worth exploring.\n \n If so, the why have the Conn. Law you cite make them felons themselves for failing to report it, and make a knowing failure to report a true theft the same punishment as knowingly trafficking a gun to a prohibited person? (Yes, it specifies a felony punishment) Was it just a back door way to deny a crime victim his RKBA by declaring him to also be a felon merely because he \"should have known\" he was a victim of crime? We recover stolen property all the time before the true owner realizes the theft and reports it because most people do not obsess over their possessions and look at them every day like Gollum does his Precious (sorry, my inner Tolkien nerd just made an appearance). I know Simone holds to the peculiar delusion that all gun owners do this with their firearms, but in reality it is far different. \n \n By the way, who else has noticed she has become so irrelevant that no one has bothered to complain how we have all hijacked her thread to have a discussion of a different topic with far more interesting and intelligent people?\n \n If your windows are broken out then you know to look for stolen items, but many burglaries happen without people even knowing about it until they have a need to get great grandma's bracelet out and find it missing-and then they spend time checking amongst the family to see if anyone borrowed it before they come to the conclusion that the nanny or the repairman must have taken it. The same goes for firearms, particularly amongst people who own several as collector's pieces that they rarely shoot. What is the standard for \"should have known?\" \n \n I am way in favor of everyone reporting any possession stolen-particularly if it has an identifiable serial number. These things are entered into a database so if it gets recovered, even in another state, it can be returned to the rightful owner. I just don't see the logic behind making felons out of crime victims, unless the motive is really to deny them their RKBA\n \n On the Capone question, let me say that it was a prosecution chosen to target the individual because they could not prove other crimes against him, but I would not compare someone suspected of mob crimes including capital murder for hire with a homeowner whose house is broken into and whose only offense is failing to report the crime quickly enough. \n \n As for politeness, I have long said that I try to show everyone the respect I think they deserve.",

   "What sinjin doesn't do, is care about positive law. His main goal is to punish or make felons out of all gun owners...if he could.\n \n What he is advocating goes against the very premise of Constitutional law and moral ethics. A person cannot be made an accessory nor an accomplice of a crime which he is himself a victim of that crime.\n \n All these spurious, self-destructing laws accomplish is utter disrespect for their sponsors and have a deleterious effect and contempt for both the authors, sponsors and the law they attempt to perpetuate. It is fraudulant, irresponsible and possibly illegal. If one was caught up in such a fraud their first reaction should be to sue the heck out of anyone associated and responsible for these criminal acts or attempting to enforce them.\n \n Attempting to raise the threshold of exercising a civil right to make felonies of completely innocent acts is 1,000 times worse than any normal activity associated with that right! No self-respecting, law abiding Judge would even accept such a complaint based on such a claim or risk censure and a life of digging ditches for the rest of their life.\n \n Sinjin, cops do not make law. Your reliance on law enforcement judgement is poorely placed. As far as your idiotic suggestion to \"tell it to the prosecutor\" is not only bad judgement it is a farce; in the first place, no self-respecting prosecutor would even consider what you have advocated and I expect you will find that out shortly.\n \n Your reliance on a 'police state' is an exposure of your socialist, dictatorial nature and belief in your superior self...not unlike any tinhorn dictator. \n \n \n5. And how we burned in the camps later,thnking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arested a quarter of the entire city,people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand? After all, your knew ahead of time that those bluecaps were out at night for no good purpose. And you could be sure ahead of time that you'd be cracking the skul of a cutthroat. Or what about the Black Maria sitting out there on the street with one lonely chauffeur-----what if it had been driven off or its tires spiked? The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt!\n - footnote 5, pg.13 Arrest -The Gulag Archipeligo - Alexandre I.

   "Thank you yet again Brian. Your real world law and police experience has added truth and soundness to the ideas, and arguments on this board. They are very much appreciated!!! And that, even though you have taken the starch out of a few of mine arguments as well! emoticon_smile\n \n Sinjin. This is why your law is unfair and unjust! \n \n We recover stolen property all the time before the true owner realizes the theft and reports it because most people do not obsess over their possessions and look at them every day ...\n \n We don't want to put anyone, who is innocent, in jail just because there is a segment of our population who Hates guns and HATES our 2nd Amendment. That, my friend, cannot be tolerated!!!\n \n Ohio's gun laws used to be bordering on insanity before 2000. Back then, we had a very anti-gun legislature who took their marching orders from then Attorney General Lee Fisher. A Handgun Control Inc. (HCI) board member. I even thought very seriously of leaving Ohio because of it. It was hard, but we in Ohio banded together, and rooted out the most egregious of these laws and the law makers! We haven't gotten to our mandatory stolen gun reporting law because it has never come to our attention. So it is benign. But what happens if we get a Lee Fisher want to be in some local office, or just someone who thinks like you! \n \n I'm sorry Sinjin, but this is intolerable, and unfair on so many levels! \n \n The same goes for firearms, particularly amongst people who own several as collector's pieces that they rarely shoot.

Want to put me in jail for that too? \n \n What you want is dangerous and puts My Inalienable Constitutionally recognized as protected rights in jeopardy just because I am a victim!\n \nWhat is the standard for \"should have known?\" \n\n Intolerable!

   "Let me address a SCOTUS quote that has been brought up here because I think it is very important to bear in mind as SCOTUS decides the incorporation case of McDonald v. Chicago.\n \n The quote was first made by Justice Harlan in a dissenting opinion in a 1961 case:\n \n &#8220;[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This &#8220;liberty&#8221; is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints, see Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U.S. 578; Holden v. Hardy, 169 U.S. 366; Booth v. Illinois, 184 U.S. 425; Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502; Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 544 (concurring opinion); Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U.S. 232, and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.&#8221; Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 543 (1961) (Justice Harlan, dissenting). (bold emphasis added by me)\n \n This quote is perhaps the best statement of the idea of the penumbra doctrine of substantive due process&#8212;that there are rights outside the BoR which SCOTUS can find and protect. The quote has gained a lot of traction over the years, and even became part of a majority opinion written by Justice O&#8217;Conner in the abortion rights case of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v.Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992).\n \n Setting aside the wisdom or lack thereof in the penumbra doctrine, for the issue of the RKBA the quote is significant. It is as clear an expression as exists that the RKBA (now decidedly determined in Heller to be an individual right) is a right which should be incorporated against the states by the due process clause of the 14th. Amendment.\n \n This is the issue to be decided in McDonald.\n \n With that in mind, here is how the current justices looking at McDonald v. Chicago have treated this famous quote of Justice Harlan in the past and may apply its rationale&#8212;at least as far as the enumerated RKBA is concerned. Bear in mind this is just my opinion and whatever psychic link I used to claim with Scalia was broken when he bit us prosecutors in the tail with this year&#8217;s decision in Melendez-Diaz.\n \n Ginsberg has never claimed the quote, but to my knowledge has never indicated hostility against its rationale. Roberts and Alito have to my knowledge never claimed the quote, but I suspect they do not favor the full application of its rationale beyond the rights specified in the BoR. My gut call, however, is all three would come down in favor of incorporation for the RKBA because it is within the BoR. A win for us gun guys.\n \n Scalia and Thomas, being strict constructionists, have in the past avoided the Harlan quote as though it were a leaper calling at the door in the dead of night&#8212;but this issue is different. Here we are not creating a right which is not listed in the Constitution, Scalia has already stated during the arguments that he is warming to the idea of substantive due process, and I think there is little doubt both will agree that the due process clause incorporates the RKBA. Another win for us gun guys.\n \n Here is where it gets interesting&#8230;. Souter, Stevens, Kennedy, and Breyer have all cited the Harlan quote with approval in the past.\n \n Breyer and Souter did so in Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702 (1997) (a case dealing with the argument that there is a due process liberty interest in assisted suicide).\n \n Souter and Stevens did so in Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266 (1994) (a case dealing with a claim that a due process right exists to be free of prosecution absent probable cause).\n \n Souter and Stevens did so in Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390 (1993) (a case dealing with whether the right of due process entitled a person to seek habeas corpus relief to overturn his conviction on a claim of actual innocence based upon a man&#8217;s claim that he has found evidence after his trial allegedly proving his innocence). \n \n And finally, Kennedy and Souter did so in the majority opinion in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992).\n \n Souter and Stevens were two of the most vocal critics of the majority opinion in Heller, and with McDonald they now find themselves on the horns of a dilemma because both have repeatedly laid claim to the logic of the Harlan quote. Indeed, all four of the current Justices who have previously cited the Harlan quote with approval now find themselves in this same dilemma. They must either remain consistent and apply the same logic in favor of incorporating the RKBA, or they are left to whatever mental gymnastics they can find to justify cutting out the words &#8220;the right to keep and bear arms&#8221; from the argument they have already adopted in other cases.\n \n This, IMO, is why so many court observers feel that incorporation is a foregone conclusion.\n \n ---\n \n &#8220;The issue, however, is not whether court rules are \"mutable\"; they assuredly are. It is not whether, in the light of \"various circumstances,\" they can be \"modifi[ed]\"; they assuredly can. The issue is whether, as mutated and modified, they must make sense. The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.&#8221; Dickerson v.

The Court simply fashions and announces a new constitutional right for pregnant mothers [410 U.S. 222] and, with scarcely any reason or authority for its action, invests that right with sufficient substance to override most existing state abortion statutes. The upshot is that the people and the legislatures of the 50 States are constitutionally dissentitled to weigh the relative importance of the continued existence and development of the fetus, on the one hand, against a spectrum of possible impacts on the mother, on the other hand. As an exercise of raw judicial power, the Court perhaps has authority to do what it does today; but, in my view, its judgment is an improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of judicial review that the Constitution extends to this Court.&#8221;",

Collins, 506 U.S. 390 (1993) (a case dealing with whether the right of due process entitled a person to seek habeas corpus relief to overturn his conviction on a claim of actual innocence based upon a man's claim that he has found evidence after his trial allegedly proving his innocence). \n \n And finally, Kennedy and Souter did so in the majority opinion in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992).\n \n Souter and Stevens were two of the most vocal critics of the majority opinion in Heller, and with McDonald they now find themselves on the horns of a dilemma because both have repeatedly laid claim to the logic of the Harlan quote. Indeed, all four of the current Justices who have previously cited the Harlan quote with approval now find themselves in this same dilemma. They must either remain consistent and apply the same logic in favor of incorporating the RKBA, or they are left to whatever mental gymnastics they can find to justify cutting out the words \"the right to keep and bear arms\" from the argument they have already adopted in other cases.\n \n This, IMO, is why so many court observers feel that incorporation is a foregone conclusion.\n \n ---\n \n \"The issue, however, is not whether court rules are \"mutable\"; they assuredly are. It is not whether, in the light of \"various circumstances,\" they can be \"modifi[ed]\"; they assuredly can. The issue is whether, as mutated and modified, they must make sense. The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.\" Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 455 (2000) (Justice Scalia, dissenting)\n\n \n Thanks, Bryan, for finishing that up nice, neat and clean! Those very words I have long used on the old NPR, ABC, TIMES, CNN and others to point out the awareness of the standing of the BOR as a basic, fundamental right. The way they describe the enshrined rights sounds more like our 2A has already been deemed incorporated and used to enhance other rights which sounds not only like the due process clause but also the P or I clause, especially when they mention \"penumbras\" radiating from those enshrined rights.\n \n I was happy to see you come in, since I got distracted, and put your educated perspective for all to see. Those words bind the justices and will surely guide their opinions in the incorporation case, McDonald which will incorporate the individual rights found in Heller. Again, thanks for your austute views! The only thing that is sad is the fine legal minds and others who have fought the long battle for our rights have already departed this earth and didn't live to see the fruits of their labor. I suppose I am lucky, although I regret the loss of many fine people who became fast friends when our paths crossed and we traveled the same path. Our endeavors have not been in vain and our hope was to secure these rights and our Constitution for our progeny, for this I am thankful for our Lord's blessing. I have been visited from many distant States during this time and have had the pleasure of their company as well as their families to share our food and home with as well as spur of the moment shooting matches and side trips, all of which we shared a mutual love for.

   "What Sinjin seems to have a great deal of trouble understanding is that mandatory reporting standards simply can't exist due to the basic physics of reality; they're like anti-matter.\n \n No self respecting prosecuting attorney is ever going to bring just such a case to trial. I'm sure the overly zealous attorneys will have no trouble insisting that victims of crime must be prosecuted no matter what, but no jury is ever going to make a conviction, so in the end all you're going to do is be wasting taxpayer money and time that could be better used in the prosecution of real criminals like drug dealers and rapists.\n \n The fact that he and others continue to argue in favor of such laws, insisting that they must be made the law of the land, that they're absolutely essential to have, etc. is just proof that they're arguing for policy, not practicality or common sense. It's nothing but agenda driven nonsense.\n \n In the end when everything is boiled down, the amount of the argument to be had is people like Sinjin claiming \"I don't care if it works or not, I want it no matter what!\"",

The Ohio legislature made it absolutely illegal to transport a firearm. Period! They did so with the express understanding that the police would only used this law judiciously, in dire circumstances, since it effectively makes every gun owner in Ohio a criminal for transporting a gun from the purchase point to their homes, or to the range, or to go hunting. Every gun owner in Ohio is now a criminal! Period. We all broke the law!\n \n We recently had to make our current legislature resend this law because new officers, who did not know the purpose of this understanding, started enforcing this law, abusively. Why not! It is on the books! \n \n I see the law that you want, in this exact same light. The agreement is such and so! 20 years later, it is a blanket indictment on everyone! Period!

Up and go to jail scumbag! \n \n Her is another guy who got jammed up, even though he did nothing wrong.\n http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/14017-government-cant-even-trust-itself.html \n \n Then there is state Preemption laws.   Preemption of Firearms Laws:\n Forty-four states have some form of firearms preemption. From very liberal Rhode Island and Maryland on the Atlantic Ocean, to very liberal California and Oregon on the Pacific Coast--and almost everywhere in-between--state legislatures have decided to prohibit some or all local laws regarding firearms. These preemption laws have two foundations: First and foremost, protecting citizens from infringement of their federal Second Amendment rights, and from infringements of their state constitutional rights to arms and rights to self-defense. The second foundation is simply good government, giving citizens one clear statewide law to follow, rather than a confusing pastiche of local laws.\n \n (Purpose) .... the bill would eliminate some abusive local laws, a great many local laws would remain untouched.\n\n In other words, when someone from a different part of the state goes into another locality, he/she does not step on a landmine for running a foul of a local ordinance that they had no knowledge of, because they do not live there, nor do they ever travel to there. \n \n Preemption is a common sense gun law right! emoticon_smile Make all laws standard. Fair and Just laws, and all! Yet, and unless I missed the timing,   the very article you provide us with is a violation of Pennsylvania Firearm Preemption laws.  Pittsburgh feels they don't have to follow that law, nor does, (recently,) Philadelphia. I guess they are special.\n \n In Ohio it is Cleveland and a few other cities who are fighting for their extra special, special interest gun laws. From what I can tell, Fair and Just, and good Common Sense Gun laws don't have the same definition when Anti-gunners don't like them, and they have ZERO intentions of following the law unless they are Absolutely, and specifically drug kicking and screaming, and FORCED to do so! \n \n How can this be. Is this not the definition of Anarchy? Or better yet, Tyranny!\n \n So now ask the question, < Can the D.A. can always be trusted!",

Is this not the definition of Anarchy? Or better yet, Tyranny!\n \n So now ask the question, < Can the D.A. can always be trusted!\n\n \n sinjin does not realize the purpose of courts. Courts are about confrontation. When one comes under adverse claims, the process of confrontatation has begun, from the first arrest and 1517 magistration the State and it's officers become adversaries whose sole purpose is to prosecute the accused to the full extent of the law. The only person you can speak with freely is your own lawyer through the attorney-client relationship. Even then, the lawyer may not assure his conduct isn't mis-feasance, mal-feasance or non-feasance and can actually make things wose instead of better. Attorneys have actually one sole purpose and that is to keep you from ever going to trial, even if it includes a plea bargain. They well understand juries are a fickle-pickle and no one can predict what they will do under any circumstance. It is risky business. If they can keep you from having to say one word in open court they are just doing their job.\n \n Approaching a prosecutor in an adversarial position is not only foolish but reckless and ill advised. If one can avoid court and a jury then one has other options to pursue when your neck isn't on the chopping block. Judges instructions to the jury are indirect and the charge is standard proceedure from the State and favors the State. That is why unjust charges often turn into convictions of some sort even though the accused may be perfectly innocent. Now that is confrontation! emoticon_frazzled Sadly enough, many if not most are not current on laws nor on court rules. They listen to the prosecutor and opposing attorney and get a feel for which side presents the best or most compelling argument. That is it in a nutshell. Being wrongly prosecuted, even if you get off, if you are not indigent will cost you about $20,000 to $30,000 dollars and the ignorant claim by near-do-wells of \"if he isn't guilty, what does he have to lose\"? See sinjin, this is the type of adversarial conduct you and your anti rights/anti gun friends advocate and pursue not only against individuals but groups and laugh about it because even if not convicted it will tie them up in court for about 3 years anyway.\n \n That is why the legislature passed a law that you can't sue gun manufacturers. Frivilous suits and claims should be made a death penalty offense and I am hoping you feel the lash along with your anti rights buddies when the 2A is incorporated. Those anti Constitutional, anti-rights .orgs have caused untold amount of grief and suffering for people who exercise their rights. Your turn in the barrel :) :) :)\n \n This isn't jr. high school and you aren't talking to principals and teachers nor can you seek solace in your little friends who adore you so much ;)",

If he can't even contemplate the possibility that police might abuse their new found authority from these mandatory reporting standards, or he simply chooses to believe that such isn't possible, then he really needs to go back to school and learn about reality.\n \n The government and its agents are required to make a substantial case before prosecution can be had, it's their requirement. But these mandatory reporting standards would allow prosecution without a case and put the requirement of proving the lack of guilt on the victims.\n \n Ignorance of the law is no excuse, isn't that what you've been saying for so long, Sinjin?
