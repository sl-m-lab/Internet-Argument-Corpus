   "Gay U.S. Reps. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), and Jared Polis (D-Colo.) teamed up with eight other House members Wednesday to reintroduce an employment non-discrimination bill that includes protections for gay and transgender people.\n \n The Employment Non-Discrimination Act, known as ENDA, was dropped into the legislative hopper with at least 118 co-sponsors as of Wednesday afternoon, with more expected to sign on shortly, Frank said at a news conference on Capitol Hill.\n \n \"We can now take for granted that there will be a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives, almost certainly this calendar year, on a fully inclusive ENDA,\" Frank said.\n \n Minutes later, he added, \"We are on track to pass this bill in the House this year.\"\n \n A companion bill has yet to be introduced in the Senate, but Hill observers have said a Senate version would be introduced shortly.\n \n Joining Frank in speaking at the news conference were Baldwin, Polis, fellow sponsor Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.), and officials from labor and business groups as well as representatives of gay and mainline civil rights organizations.\n \n No Republican House members attended the news conference. A list of the initial group of 118 co-sponsors shows that only six GOP House members have signed on to the bill so far. They include Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), Michael Castle (R-Del.), Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), Leonard Lance (R-N.J.), Todd Platts (R-Pa.) and Judy Biggert (R-Ill.).\n \n Ros-Lehtinen, Castle, Kirk, Platts and Lance signed on as lead sponsors, along with Democratic House members Frank, Baldwin, Polis, Reps. John Conyers (D-Mich.), Rob Andrews (D-N.J.) and George Miller (D-Calif.).\n \n Civil rights group representatives speaking at the news conference, including David Smith, vice president of the Human Rights Campaign, and Nancy Darner of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, said they were committed to resuming the lobbying that they have conducted on behalf of ENDA for more than a decade.\n\n Another shot for ENDA\n \n Repeated polls amongst Republicans show overwhelming support FOR laws that prevent employment discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n Yet the Republican politicians habitually flout the will of their base, and cater to the anti-gay extremists. emoticon_frazzled\n \n We'll see if the same holds true for this year.",
