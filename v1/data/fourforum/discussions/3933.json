   "Under our voting system, there will always be two big parties. Why?\n \n The winner-take-all voting system doesn't offer any reward for gaining more than 50% of the vote in a district. So if the GOP starts getting 70-80% of the votes overall in the country's voting districts, effectively becoming a \"one party,\" it will still have just as much representation as it would be getting if it only got 55% of the vote. So what happens? Both parties shift to the right. Democrats start getting close to 50% of the vote again, and we still have the two party system.",

   "I think the article is seriously flawed. While the democrats were defeated in the recent election, the liberals still took the white house.\n \n Like Dono, I am an old school republican. The republican party I remember does not pass trillions of dollars worth of social programs, huge barrels of pork, and laws which relegate the constitution to the little roller next to the toilet. These were always things left to the democrats. \n \n We didn't beat the democrats. We just had some of them run as republicans and win. \n \n I think that the biggest difference between this election and elections of the past is that the canidates, lacking any real issues upon which to run, instead managed to firmly convince the American public that if \"the other guy\" was elected (who incidentally held the same views and had the same stated policies), the nation would be destroyed. \n \n I think the article is more than a little premature in its ascertation that the Democratic party is slipping into obscurity. They need to do a little work as far as damage control type PR, but they are far from dead. They had a bad canidate. Next time up they will come up with a better one.",
