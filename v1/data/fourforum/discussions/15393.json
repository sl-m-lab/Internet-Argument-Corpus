   "YouTube - Derren Brown - Miracles for Sale\n \n Possibly NSFW for language.\n \n British sceptic, illusionist, and TV personality Derren Brown takes an ordinary man and turns him into a faith healer to expose this widespread scam in front of a live audience in the bible belt-buckle of Texas.\n \n This show, to me, is quite nerve striking. Very suspenseful and tense, but a great relief towards the end. Deceit and lies come together to battle deceit and lies, for the benefit of people who have been scammed and lied to by those who abuse religious belief to gain vast sums of money from people who are genuinely suffering. If you have an hour and 15 minutes to waste, check this out. It isn't Derren's best work, but quite fitting after what happened late last month, when one American scammed a great deal of money out of people who have been deceived, and is still seen as a respectful minister and valued member of the church.\n \n To see more of what Derren Brown does, check out what I think to be his best show, Hero at 30 000 Feet.\n \n p.s. Does anyone know how to embed videos on this site?",
