   "For anyone who doesn't know already, I should explain that the\" Imitation of Christ\" is a manual of spiritual advice written in the 15th century (supposedly) by a monk known as Thomas \u00e0 Kempis. It was written in Latin: I used to have a copy with the Latin printed on each page translated into English on the facing page. \n \n The \"Imitation\" is not a theological treatise, it is a manual of spiritual advice for those who wish to dedicate themselves to what Jesus called, the way, the truth, and the life. Thomas teaches that true Christians cannot gain salvation through erudite and sophisticated religious inquiry; they must assume simplicity and follow the path trodden by Jesus Christ and model their lives by his example. \n \n This means it is not enough to pay lip service to the following values or precepts; true Christians must actualize them in their lives by conduct which signifies that blessed are the poor and humble, and those who are ill-used by the world; that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven; that they should judge not, lest they be judged; that they should swear not at all; that they should take no thought for the morrow; that if someone should take their cloak, they should give him their coat also; that if they would be perfect, they should sell all that they have and give it to the poor; that they should love their neighbours as themselves; that they should not resist evil; that they should not lay up treasures upon this earth where moth and rust doth consume and thieves steal. \n \n How many Christians hold material possessions in contempt, abandon their iPods, take these precepts of Jesus to heart and imitate his life as Thomas \u00e0 Kempis instructed ? I suggest that very few, if any, do this: most Christians are probably just passive or inert religious dilettantes - which is one cogent reason why the multitude pays no respectful attention to what they have to say.\n \n There are standards of Christian perfection which might be impossible for \"ordinary\" human beings to achieve, and I'm not assuming a superior attitude here since I'm a non-believing 100% materialist. However, if I counted myself a Christian, shouldn't I be prepared to follow in the footsteps of Jesus along the rocky road to the kingdom of heaven ? \n \n I can't remember what happened to my copy of the \"Imitation\". It was thrown away long ago, and I guess I've been on Route 666 ever since.",

I prefer the Latin because the meaning is so much deeper, more nuanced and more textured than the English translations I have seen.\n \n \"Imitations\" had a profound effect on my understanding of what it meant to be a Christian (a follower of Jesus). Kempis makes clear that it is the words and teachings of Jesus that are the center piece of a Christian life - Love one another, turn the other cheek, Love your enemies, Love your neighbor, plus all the other exhortations you mention.

(though in some cases, non-Christian ideals have entered into the picture as well, such as celibacy in the priesthood and total abstinence from alcohol, to name a couple) Christian ideals are sometimes kind of like weight training. One has to constantly try to lift weights harder than he's used to dealing with, because it increases strength more that way. He can never really get to the point where he masters it, because there's always going to be more weight there to lift. You're right though, one side effect to that is that people inevitably see Christians unable to live up to those ideals. But ultimately Christians aren't really answerable to those people anyway.",

   "Have you made an effort to imitate the life of Christ by shunning the baubles of this world - both actual and figurative - and with what success ?\n\n \n That is a deeply personal question and my instinct is that in a forum like this any attempt to answer may well change the entire tone. I note Jesus words about doing and giving and praying - do them in secret. It is too close to the edge of arrogance for my comfort to discuss in detail how actions comply with the teachings of Jesus. Suffice it to say that perfection has not yet been reached.\n \n That said, it is a question I put in front of myself every day. I do it by contemplating the words of Jesus, \"Sell your possessions, give the money to those in need and come follow me.\" I have come to understand \"possessions\" exist two categories: needs and wants. Jesus addresses both. \"The father knows what you need before you even ask\", \"Look at the birds of the sky, they neither reap nor sow and their heavenly father takes care of them. What makes you think you are less than one of these?\" \"Take no thought for your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?\" \"Father thy will not mine be done.\"\n \n So our needs are already taken care of and what we want is unimportant, what God wants is what matters. That is a very difficult understanding to grasp, let alone live up to. It is also a fundamental teaching of Jesus.",

   "What might be called the \"economic theory\" of Christianity is deeply perplexing - at least to me.\n \n For example; if a Christian should give all his possessions to the poor, he immediately becomes part of the condition he is trying to alleviate. To be a Good Samaritan, one must have money. The people who can best afford to perform good works and help their neighbours etc., are the ones who have laid up treasure on this earth. (One could go on in this vein, but the general idea is clear enough).\n \n These sort of contradictions are often smothered by reference to the \"joys\" of poverty or, to be more fair perhaps, by reference to the reward in heaven which is promised to those who have endured misery in this life.\n \n To the cheerful materialist, this \"economic\" message simply does not make sense.\nAlan, on my recent journey I had an opportunity to peruse cable TV and caught a fascinating snippet of the televangelist Joyce Meyer.

I, personally, find the verse a tad ambiguous and capable of being interpreted in many ways.\n \n Alan, would you care to go out on a limb and posit what it might have been that Jesus meant when he said such a thing? I fear that you may be opening yourself to attack from all sides should you do such a thing, but I'd be very interested in your take.\n \n Thanks.",

He does make some enormous charitable contributions which could also result from a wee bit of guilt concerning how much wealth and power he has--and I think that he has made some very wise choices in distributing his wealth.

   "I think that we are all using the word \"love\" in the wrong way. Love in the sense that Jesus was using it is what makes the sun rise and the grass grow. It is not some emotion we feel toward someone. Love is what we exist in. Without the \"Love of God\" we simply would not be. You have to read the entire teaching to fully grasp it. Jesus first says: \"Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;\" (Mt 5:44)\n \n And then he tells us why he says that: \"That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.\"\n \n Why? So that you will be in the flow of truth: Children of your Father who gives the good stuff (sun, rain, etc.) to people we judge as good and people we judge as bad. This connects with his teaching that we should \"Judge not lest we be judged\", as well as, \"as you believe so it is done to you.\" That is why I say that it is the most difficult concept of Jesus' teachings to grasp. It is what separates his teachings from all others. \n \n It connects with Moses allegory of the Fall of Man. Man is cast from the Garden of Eden when he eats from The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. When man comes to believe that there is another creative power in the universe, evil, man enters a world of duality. Whereas in truth there is only one power in the universe, God. And in the world that God created in Genesis 1 there is no such thing as evil: \"God looked at all he created and said it is good.\" This a major connection between the teachings of Jesus and the teachings of Moses. It is staggeringly difficult to get our minds around. It flies in the face of all we have been taught. That is why Jesus says, \"Unless you be like a child you cannot enter the Kingdom of Heaven.\" Existence is a gift that we are meant to revel in -- in all ways. \"The Kingdom of heaven is here now.\" \"It is the Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.\" \"The Kingdom of Heaven is within you.\" - and you don't have to do sh*t to \"earn it. \"Look at the birds of the sky, they neither reap nor sow and their heavenly father takes care of them. What makes you think you are less than one of these?\"\n \n That is the \"Love\" that Jesus speaks of.",

Not because it is not a valid statement on your part, but because the Church is often disconnected from the teachings of Jesus.\n \n I am also not going to come up with verses that say the opposite of those you quote. I believe that Jesus said what he meant and meant what he said. It is the translations and interpretations that at times are incorrect. What I would like to do is put the verses in the context of his overall teachings. \n \n You quote part of Luke 6:26. \"Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you.\" The full verse reads: \"Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.\" (Luke 6:26) That verse is in a long sermon that Jesus was giving that basically was encouraging people to follow his teachings and warning them of some consequences and some things to look for. This verse, in context, means watch out when everybody praises you because it may lead you to false pride. That is a very simplistic take on it. The point is, it was not telling people that no one should ever speak well of them. Bottom line, it is not connected to the other \"poverty\" verses that you site.\n \n The same is true of your quote: \"Ye cannot serve both God and mammon.\" The full verse reads: \"No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\" (Mt:6:24) This is a theological/philosophical thought which proposes that at some point you will have conflict between following your conscience and making money. I think that is something a lot of people can relate to. \n \n \nIf thou wilt be perfect, go and sell all that thou hast and give it to the poor, and thou shall have treasure in heaven.\n \n The kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls, who when he had found a pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it.\nThese two are loosely related. The first which you render as, \"If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell all that thou hast and give it to the poor, and thou shall have treasure in heaven.\" The full verse reads, \"Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.\" (Mt 19:21) You equate that with being destitute - and I can see that interpretation if that was all he said. But this verse need to be put into the context of other teachings. Notably: \"Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? 26: Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?\" (Mt 6:25) And then, in the same sermon he explains the theme of the sermon: \"But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.\" (Mt 6:33) he is not saying don't enjoy the bounty of the earth, he is definitely not saying that you will or should be deprived (all these things will be added). He is saying, don't make it a focus of your life. That was also his message in the parable about the merchant which you note above. Do what is right (seek first the kingdom) and don't worry about the rest, trust that it will come to you. There are many more teachings that Jesus has on this subject. I have just scratched the surface.",

As to your contention that Jesus encouraged us to \"renounce the world\", it is simply not supported by the words attributed to him in the Gospels. He is reminding us that the material world is not all there is. \n \n \nYou do not appear to entertain a scintilla of doubt that your interpretation of the testimony which has been cited, is the correct one.

I don't think I said that. What I meant was, the steady drumbeat of misrepresentation over time has made the misrepresentation seem to be the truth. So even those who are seeking truth are surprised when they simply read what Jesus actually said because it flies in the face of what many say he taught. As far as a \"scintilla of doubt\", what I was bringing to you attention is what he said. Interpret it how you want, but don't just dismiss it. The \"interpretive\" discourse begins with the sometimes uninformed and other times erroneous (sometimes purposefully erroneous) translations from the Greek that have dogged these teachings. \n \n \nThat following the example of Christ means spurning affluence, loving enemies, paying no heed to the future, and so on, seems to be confirmed by the existence of so many religious orders that took vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience for the express purpose of imitating Christ as closely as possible. \n\"Seems to be confirmed\" is not the same as \"is confirmed\". Everyone is free to do whatever they wish. I was simply addressing what \"Jesus\" said.\n \n \nThe question I have not seen answered is whether the \"ordinary\" Christian living in a secular world can truly imitate the life of Christ without compromise and equivocation of the gospel values.\n\"Look at the birds of the sky, they neither reap nor sow and their heavenly father takes care of them. What makes you think you are less than one of these?\" Read it over a couple of times. I looks to me that what this says is, all the bird has to do is be a bird and it has everything it needs. What makes you think that if you are simply who you are you won't have everything you need too? That is what he taught to \"ordinary\" people. \n \n As far as your question, Christianity has very little to do with \"imitating Christ\" and everything to do with, \"letting your light shine\" as Jesus taught. The \"values\" in his teachings are not a straight jacket to squeeze into, they are like signposts showing us how to having a great time and revel in the gift of life. He doesn't say, \"shun the material world\" he says, give it its due, but not more than that because then you wonn't have as much fun. Sure, \"render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's\", but don't forget to \"render unto God that which is God's\" - and what is God, some chubby guy up in the clouds? No, he is \"Our Father who art in heaven.\" And where is heaven? \"The kingdom of heaven in within you.\"\n \n What he said and taught isn't really hard to find out.

   "Of course Jesus may have been a wit, but nothing in the gospels suggests as much. Perhaps I ought to have been more specific and said that the scriptures contain no humour whatsoever. Can you give chapter and verse for a joke in them ?\n \n As for my Jesuit teachers, I can confirm they were not a solemn bunch; in fact I could relate many amusing anecdotes about their behaviour. But I could also tell tales of their cruelty and intellectual arrogance. I must also admit that I was very well schooled at their academy.\nLook at Luke 15:8 where he pokes fun at a woman and her jewelry. And what about Matthew 25 when he tells the story of the ten virgins? The problem we have seen too many images of these serious-faced, bearded, ascetic Jesuses with those piercing blue eyes. Don't forget either, that Jesus was a Jew. There is a long and treasured connection between Jews and a sense of humor - especially certain Jewish denominations and the celebrations they are famous for on holy days. See if you can remove the coloration added by years of training and read some of what he said as if he had a sense of humor. As I am sure you know, almost all preachers and teachers use humor as a tool. If you look closely, you may find that Jesus did too.",

It is more than language as we know it in the 21st Century. It does not relate well or translate well into Greek or Latin or German. If you read the Hebrew and then the Latin Vugate Bible, you will see how the Latin (wonderfully expressive language that it is) falls well shy of the Hebrew. The simple phrase in Genesis, \"In the beginning...\" does not convey the Hebrew word \"re'shiyth\". It was translated in the Latin Vulgate as \"principio\", meaning \"in principle\" and then into English as \"In the beginning...\" but it really means much more than that. It means \"beginning\", as well as \"first in manifestation\", \"starting point\", \"first cause\" \"prime principle\". It means all those things with the added contextual understanding of eternal -- becasue prior to verse one, God existed. We have reduced it to daylight savings time hours -- like the beginning of a race. You could not do that if you read and understood the Hebrew.",

If you're interested in studying the history and meaning of the Bible, you should always remember it's translated.\n\n \n Oh, I know its been translated, and mistranslated, numerous times. But that only helps my position in showing that the Bible is flawed.\n \n And, it is the English Bible that the millions of Christians read and live by that I am addressing, like the NIV version I quoted from. If you openly admit that these English Bibles are flawed and worthless - which you and some others apparently do believe - that's fine with me: it makes my job all the easier.\n \n \n \n But then again, one has to wonder if what you say is true. After all, the NIV Bible I quoted from says:\n \n \n\"The New International Version is a completely new translation of the Holy Bible made by over a hundred scholars working directly from the best available Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts. ... \n \n The translation of each book was assigned to a team of scholars. Next, one of the Intermediate Editorial Committees revised the initial translation, with constant reference to the Hebrew, Aramaic, or Greek. There work then went to one of the General Editorial Committees, which checked it in detail and made another thorough revision. This revision in turn was carefully reviewed by the Committe on Bible Translation, which made further changes and then released the final version for publication. In this way the entire Bible underwent three revisions, during each of which the translation was examined for its faithfulness to the original languages and for its English style.\n \n All this involved many thousnds of hours of research and discussion regarding the meaning of the texts and the precise way of putting them into English. It may well be that no other translation has been made by a more thorough process of review and revision from committee to committee than this one.\n \n ...\n \n The first concern of the translators has been the accurracy of the translation and its fidelity to the thought of the biblical writers. They have weighed the significance of the lexical and grammatical details of the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts. At the same time, they have striven for more than a word-for-word translation. Because thought patterns and syntax differe from language to language, faithful communication of the meaning of the writers of the Bible demands frequent modifications in sentence structure and constant regard for the contextual meaning of words.\"\n \n ...\n \n\n \n So I guess you're saying that they lied?",

Anything that a man has written (including what I am writing here) is useless unless you take the time to understand it. Give Shakespeare to the average high school student in the US and there is a 50-50 chance that the student will not understand his writings - and he wrote in English - and I guess we can forget about Chaucer altogether.\n \n There are certain writings that are worth the time and energy to understand. Of all the spiritual writings of western civilization, the Bible is the one most worth the time and energy to understand. In fact there is no other book in western civilization that compares to it. The only other writings that compare are those of Taoist poet Lao-tzu.\n \n I suggest that before one dismisses something as \"useless\" one makes an effort to understand it. Otherwise one can look foolish - Like Sir William Preece, one of Britain's most distinguished scientists and a Fellow of the Royal Society. After examining Alexander Graham Bell's new invention, the telephone, he rejected it on the grounds that, \"England has plenty of small boys to run messages.\" Preece later surpassed even this judgment. When told that Thomas Edison was researching an incandescent electric lamp with a high-resistance filament, Preece described it as \"A completely idiotic idea.\" \n \n So, one should not dismiss something as \"useless\" unless one understands it.",

Will you give me the post #?\n\n \n I'll post the relevant material.\n \n \nAnd God said, \"Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.\" So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind.

   "Now, are the above Biblical passages conveying true stories exactly as told? Or is the real meaning of them hidden and one must access the original texts to decode their true meaning?\nThey are stories similar to other creation stories of other cultures. However, it is impossible to take a couple of sentences out of a story and ask what their \"true meaning\" is. Stories have themes, just like poems, or plays or movies. Shakespeare wrote, \"All the word's a stage.\" You can pose the same question with that verse. Is Shakespeare conveying a true story exactly as told? Is the world really a stage? Or is the real meaning of the verse hidden and one must access the original texts to decode their true meaning? What about the works of James Joyce and e. e. cummings?\n \n \"my love is building a building\n around you, a frail slippery\n house, a strong fragile house\"\n \n How would you address that?

   "I think you missed the point of the rest of my post - is it pointless to take a translation of a set of poems, histories and philosophy as being the literal and inerrant word of God? Quite likely, unless of course it is and the original wirters weren't taking it seriously, but we'll leave that up to certain others to consider.\n \n So we have a translation of Ancient Hebrew law, philosophy, poems and history - other than the 'puns' and some of the symbolism that would be more accurate in the original language (though of course translation is a lot more than just substituting words, hence my reference to Reaperman and the Dutch translation) why is it any different from the original?\n Beowulf suddenly doesn't become fact when translated into english, its just convinient as most scholars and interested people don't speak the language. Sure its important to remember that this isn't the native langauge when you interpret parts and to reference back to see if it still makes sense with the conclusion you have used the version you understand to come to.\n \n Why is this different from a normal translation - a book suddenly doesn't change its plot because the language changes, its barely anything other than emphasis and references.\n \n Even if you take it literally, its still doesn't matter all that much if its not the native language, as long as you don't take the translation to be the absolute literal one. However if its a decent translation then there shouldn't be any glaring errors, especially if its a book with one single 100% accurate message.",

   "You too have missed the point!\n\n \n Sorry to say, but, it is you who has apparently missed the point. The authors of the Torah, especially with regard to Genesis, were attempting to get across a point, the point being that 1) there exists a divine being, and 2) that this being created the universe and everything in it. So, they told a story. The details of the story are irrelevant and are easily attacked. It's the point that counts. I suggest that you pay less attention to the trees and, instead, concentrate on the forest. \n \n Granted, there is a lot of nonsense in the Bible, and one can make a career out of pointing out such nonsense. But I believe that concentrating on the literal nonsense obscures the deeper, somewhat hidden, concepts contained within the text. And I would apply the same caveat to any so-called sacred text.",

   "So, apparently the best Howard could come up with to try to wiggle out of the Biblical predicament he found himself in was to implicitly label the Bible as fiction and/or poetry.\nI'm not quite sure why you say 'mere' poetry: poetry often conveys meaning more deeply and at more levels than prose. But in any case, a factual statement of events cannot cover moral ideas (as these aren't public facts) or religious ones. \n \n \nSo Christians are willing to die for a mere poem? Or a mere work of fiction? Wow, I wonder if I played on people's emotions the way religious leaders do - that is, after all, mostly what religion is: an emotional crutch - if I could get anyone to believe in \"Mary had a little lamb\" enough to die for it?!?!?!\nHave you never read poetry deeper than nursery rhymes? Frankly, it would be strange if people died for a factual account of how exactly the earth formed.\n \n But you must realise that sometimes people DO take poetic, religious, mythic, ethical, writing for fact. You seem to be doing so, and EZ does so as well. People also take fact as an ethical or quasi-religious meaning (the belief of the Nazis that Darwinism carries a moral imperative for instance \n \n \nSo the Crusaders slaughtered multiple tens of thousands of men, women, and children, armed and unarmed, Muslim, Jewish, and even other Christians, for nothing more than a mere poem?\n \n What about the Qu'ran?

But the argument isn't about whose poem is 'better', but whose conveys the truth. And often its more about power and politics than either.\n \n \nWho knows where the actual facts about God and His creation - the Universe and life - can be found.

But this particular point is more a topic for another thread (what effect does not accepting all of the Bible have on the rest).

Some of the facts may be wrong because people were either given false information or didn't know something and made it parts up. \n \n \n\n IF the Bible is NOT to be taken literally, then its is useless IN THAT one cannot understand what the Bible is trying to say just by reading it.

Apparently next to nothing\n\n Again, why must it be 100% understandable or 100% incomprehensible? Why do you have no respect for translater whatsoever? Your english version is as close as someone can get to explaining what the original hebrew means. Jesus used parables all the time to explain things, surely that hints that the older parts are in a similar format in places just without the additional commentry you get from him.\n Long as you understand that your translation is not perfect, you can certainly get a fair way to understanding man's relationship with God from a translation. However its not 100% accurate to what was originally said, doesn't mean its totally wrong though - but if you want to take your study of this relationship to the top levels then it would make sense to look at the original document.\n Or can we tell nothing of medieval england from a translation of Chaucer?\n \n [QUOTE=DamEtel]\n Now here's an example: the Genesis account of Creation. The Bible says God created certain animals and celestial bodies in a certain order, and made man from the dust of the Earth, and then made Adam fall asleep, then yanked out a rib from Adam's body and made Eve with it. \n \n \n\n Alos, by demoting the Bible into a mere \"poem\", you destroy it's information content. When taken literally, the Bible contains a lot of information, but when demoted to mere poetry, you lose all of that information. \n \n For example, which statement conveys more information.\n \n a) Somebody did something to someone else in order to do something at some place.\n \n b) God yanked a rib from Adam in order to make Eve, in the Garden of Eden.\n \n Clearly the second sentence conveys much more information than the first (information being a measure of the decrease in uncertainty, and if we move from the first sentence to the second, our uncertainty is vastly decreased, so our information is vastly increased).\n However if you can get it to rhyme or put the facts in a story its easier to remember and pass on - its a balance between the amount of information you can pass on and the number of times that this can happen. \n \n \n\n If you can't show me the factual basis of the Bible, using the Bible, and you destroy the Bible's information content by demoting it to a \"poem\", then the Bible is useless for learning facts about the real world and God. \n That first bit is circular reasoning anyway - surely the factual basis of the bible should come from another source. You also seem to have a problem with 'poems' containing truth - I'm sure a lot of people would say that a song or poem and the heartbreak and loss felt with first love is a lot more moving and informative than a quite list of how hormone balances changed. Even if the latter would allow you to recreate the same experience for yourself if you had the means. I can't give you any 'facts' about man's relationship with God though, I don't speak or read hebrew nor beleive that there is anything to have a relationship with. I can see the principle though.\n \n \n\n And if Christians want the Bible to just be just a good little poem, then they should be mocked, denounced, and if possible imprisoned or otherwise punished, for all the strife, divisiveness, and death they have caused on its behalf.\n Why is a philosophy in verse any less worthy than one in prose? Not to mention this is just vicious anyway and makes little sense. There are plenty of people using all manner of reasons to do the same thing, and like the Christians, we try to stop them if at all possible anyway. \n \n \n\n PS: I just realized a loophole of sorts in my statements that someone might try to use to avoid answering, or pretend to answer, my questions. When I am asking about the Bible's giving facts concerning the real world, I am not talking about mere history, such as what king lived in what country at what time and so forth. If all the Bible is is a history book, then it's useless for its stated/intended purpose. I have explicitly mentioned the Creation account in Genesis throughout my exchanges - from my very first post in this thread - and that is the main portion of the Bible I am discussing. Everyone with at least half a brain should be able to easily comprehend what I am saying.\n You need to seperate your questions - you don't want facts about the real world from the creation in Genesis unless you are taking it literally, what you want is how the unusual ideas in it represent aspects in the relationship between Man and God don't you or  some proof from another source that it can be taken to be a true and accurate record of what happened.\n \n I'm not really sure this is a good bit to choose anyway - seeing as we are dealing with the few bits that weren't written by the people there (or contemporaries of them), seeing as they hadn't been created yet.",

Only if the Bible - the Genesis account of Creation in particular - is taken literally can all people who read it possibly come away with the same understanding; only with a literal interpretation would it be possible to come away with something concrete that describes some actual facts about the real world.

Great literary minds like Melville and Whitman got something out of it. Great scientific minds like Stephen Hawking got something out of it.

If you read something literally then it has, essentially, only one possible meaning. If you read something poetically, it could have a multitude of diffrent meanings, and if only one is correct (which we assume holds for the Bible and reality), then which one of the many is it? You increase uncertainty by going from literal to interpretive/poetic.

   "OK, now I see the roots of the problem. You are working on the claim that the Bible is meant to be inerrant and 'written by God'.\n \n The term 'god-breathed' is very different to 'god inspired'. God also brethes life into man, but man still has free will and opposes God. \n \n Also, many people accept the importance of the Bible without believing it's all true. Timothy is one of the dodgiest bits, seemingly not written anywhere near the time of Christ, not by Paul and is out of step in many ways. Frankly, a lot of people ignore it.\n \n Finally, that reference to 'scripture' was made before the Bible was compiled: you cannot treat it as if someone simply sat down and wrote the whole thing. Therefore it's hard to see how it's refering to the Bible, which didn't exist. As 'scripture' can mean 'writing' or specifically refer to 'holy writing', the statement becomes pretty meaningless: he's either saying 'what is truly holy writing is god-breathed - (almost tautology)' or 'what is presented as holy writing is god-breathed - (leads to contradiction if taken strongly)' or 'all writing is god-breathed - (interesting as a view of the whole world and all creation as holy, but hardly useful for any practical purpose)'.\n \n Ironically, whle you've been accusing your opponents of creating straw men, you seem to have based your entire argument on the straw man of evangelical fundamentalism as representing religion and meaning in the Bible.",

   "Invalid analogies. Those who look at an architectural drawing and do understand it come away with the same understanding; they come away with something concrete. \nThat is completely incorrect, and anyone who has ever built a house knows it. Do you know how many errors are made because of the misreading or misunderstanding or lack of clarity of blueprints?\n \n \nThose who use Einstein's special theory of relativity to calculate this or that come away with the same answer, and the results describe, as accurately as possible, some actual fact about the real world.\nAgain, this is incorrect. All you have to do is read Stephen Hawking and Andrei Linde. They come away with completely different answers based on the same evidence and Einstein's Theory of Relativity. See, it is a theory, not a fact.\n \n \nNone of this is true for the Bible - UNLESS IT IS TAKEN LITERALLY! Only if the Bible - the Genesis account of Creation in particular - is taken literally can all people who read it possibly come away with the same understanding; only with a literal interpretation would it be possible to come away with something concrete that describes some actual facts about the real world. But we all already know that fails.\nAs I have pointed out over and over, there are disagreements as to what Freud meant, what Shakespeare meant, what James Joyce meant, what Franz Kafka meant, what Einstein meant, and on and on. The Bible falls into that same realm of human questioning and questing. Two Freudian psychologists will come up two completely different diagnoses and protocols using Freud to support them. Also, have you ever heard two economists take the same facts and one concludes growth and the other concludes retrenchment? Can you name an area where there is not disagreement, differing opinions and views? Can you name a metaphoric work like a Shakespearean play or a Greek tragedy that is not open to question and interpretation? Do you know how many versions there are of Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard? How many different translations and interpretations? Perhaps you don't walk away from a reading or a performance of those works having come to any greater understanding that you had, but many people do.\n \n \nHoward Beale: I never said it was \"just poetry\" I said it was like poetry or fiction.\n\n \n \nNeither of which is the stated/intended/claimed purpose of the Bible!\n\nChekhov in his play The Cherry Orchard never says his purpose, neither does Eugene O'Neill or Tennessee Williams or Arthur Miller. Casablanca, The Godfather, Start Wars... none of them start off with (or at any point during the film make) a statement that this is just a movie. What about Melville? Whitman? Frost? None of them start their works of fiction of by saying, \"This is just a poem\", or \"This is just a story, it is not factual.\" Many metaphoric works of fiction, both prose and poetry do not state or claim their purpose.\n \n As far as what the Bible intended, that is open to interpretation just like the writings of Freud, Jung, Adler and Frankel or any other writer who is dealing with issues that go beyond the factual and the material.\n \n \nA slew of different interpretations of the Bible exist: if it really is the Word of God, then which ONE is correct? How can one tell for sure? \nFirst, I never claimed that it was the word of God, so go take that up with people who claim that.\n \n \nIf it's just poetry, philosophy, or fiction, then it's not really The Holy Bible: it's just a best seller fiction book sitting on one's coffee table.\nI fully agree with that. That is why I said it is just a book. It is a good book, but it is not the only book - and as a book, even though you may think so, it is not a useless book. Some modern western law is based on that book.\n \n \nIs the Biblical account of Creation to be taken as poetry - analogous to (a), where actual names, places, times, and events are uncertain/unknown - or is it to be taken literally, as in (b), where actual names, places, times, and events are specified and certain.\nThe biblical account of creation is metaphoric - where the names, places, times and events are metaphors - words that describe physical realities are used to stand for intellectual, emotional, spiritual, ethical, etc., concepts. The Garden of Eden is not a place in the Middle East, it represents a state of being or a state of mind. Adam (which means man) is symbolic of mankind (like in the Medieval play \"Everyman\". I could go on, but I think I have made the point.\n \n \nIs the Bible JUST a book? Like any other fiction book one would pick up at the local book store? If so, then why are you arguing against me??? If not, then why separate it from the religion that lives by it and considers it to be the actual Word of the Almighty God?\nOf course it is a book. What did you think it was a shoe? I am only arguing with you when you claim that it is useless. I don't dismiss Freud because others twist his writings to the detriment of their patients and/or to fit their needs. I don't dismiss Sun-Tzu because some use it as a book of tactical warfare. I don't dismiss Desmond Tutu because he bases his beliefs on a book.",

There is a reason that Moses' Ten Commandments are atop the Supreme Court building along with Hammurabi and other law givers. Historians recognize that they were the basis for some of our laws. The Bible was clear and useful enough that laws could be based on it. So, some very intelligent men saw usefulness in it.\n \n Also, please correct the incorrect post I brought to your attention earlier.",

And do you mean the one Christians call the Ten Commandments, or the one the Bible does? They are different, you know...\n \n \nDon't boil a young goat in the milk of its mother. --Believe it or not, this prohibition in Exodus 34:26 is the official tenth commandment, from the only set of stone tablets that were called \"the ten commandments.\" There were three sets of commandments: \n \n 1) The first time Moses came down from Mount Sinai with commandments, he merely recited a list (Exodus 20:2-17), which is the version most churches today erroneously call the \"Ten Commandments,\" although they were not engraved on stone tablets and not called \"the ten commandments.\"\n \n 2) The first set of stone tablets was given to Moses at a subsequent trip up the mountain (Exodus 31:18). In this farcical story, Moses petulantly destroyed those tablets when he saw the people worshipping the golden calf (Exodus 32:19).\n \n 3) So he went back for a replacement. God told Moses: \"Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.\" (Exodus 34:1) Here is what was on the replacement tablets (from Exodus 34:14-26):\n \n 1) Thou shalt worship no other God. 2) Thou shalt make thee no molten gods. 3) The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. 4) Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest. 5) Thou shalt observe the feast of weeks. 6) Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the Lord God. 7) Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven. 8) Neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left until the morning. 9) The first of the firstfruits of thy land shalt thou bring unto the house of the Lord thy God. 10) Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk. \n \n Keep this in mind next time you are tempted to boil a goat. This list differs, obviously, from the one in Exodus 20 (was God's memory faulty?), but it is only this list that is called the \"Ten Commandments\": \"And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.\" (Exodus 34:28)\n (http://www.ffrf.org/quiz/scripts/bquiz_results.php)\n \n",

   "[QUOTE=Alan Ryan] shouldn't I be prepared to follow in the footsteps of Jesus along the rocky road to the kingdom of heaven ?/QUOTE]\n \n I do not think so. Jesus was (is) a paradox because he did not follow his own teachings. There is a major difference between following in the footsteps of Jesus and simply embracing and practicing the teachings of love. \n Following in the footsteps of Jesus has produced 2 billion 'crucified' individuals, worldwide. They are 'crucified' on their circumstances, on their jobs, in their marriages, in their bodies, etc., in a continual expression of pathos and relative pain. \n \n Pain is not a necessary ingredient of the spiritual path. The path is simply embracing a kind (Golden Rule) and loving disposition towards everyone and everything. It can be a smooth transition which produces immediate and positive results. If you seek first the 'kingdom of heaven' (Christ quote) then everything else shall be added unto you. The kingdom of heaven, according to Christ, 'is within'. It is underneath the ego, the fear based separated self, the defiant entity (selfish) that has replaced God with self. \n \n It is easy and only requires a change of mind and a change of heart.",

If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.\"\n\n \n For now, let us deal with what Jesus intended to convey to his disciples that the Father was greater than he. In the first place, the term for \"greater\" (Greek - meizon) does not necessarily imply one who is greater in nature or essence. It can refer to someone or something being greater in a position and/or authority, just as the following passages show:\n \n \"I tell you the truth: Among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater (meizon) than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.\" Matthew 11:11\n \n John being greater than all those born of women does not imply that the rest were less human than John, or that they were inferior to John in nature. Here, the term must mean that John was greater in position and rank.\n \n \"Truly, truly, I say to you, a slave is not greater (meizon) than his master, nor is one who is sent greater (meizon) than the one who sent him.\" John 13:16\n \n Both the slave and the one sent are just as human as the master and the sender, having the same human essence and nature that the master and sender have. Thus, greater here must mean in position and authority, not in essence and nature.\n \n \"I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater (meizona) things than these, because I am going to the Father.\" John 14:12 \n \n Jesus' disciples did not perform better works, but performed a greater number of works than Christ since they reached far more people than Jesus did while he was on earth. Hence, the term \"greater\" refers to quantity, the amount of works, as opposed to quality since the disciples performed the same type of works but in far greater number.\n \n The preceding data shows that the word meizon can either mean, depending upon the context, greater in nature, position, or even both. Thus, the only way we can know for certain what Jesus meant by saying that the Father was greater than him is by reading his statement in its immediate context. A careful look at the entire chapter of 14 shows the Lord Jesus claiming to have all of God's omni-attributes:\n \n \"And I WILL DO whatever you ask IN MY NAME, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. You may ask ME for anything in my name, AND I WILL DO IT.\" John 14:13-14\n \n Christ is capable of personally answering all prayers that are directed to him or are addressed in his name. The only way that Christ can both hear and answer all these prayers is if he is both omniscient and omnipotent!\n \n \"On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, AND I AM IN YOU. Whoever has my commands and obeys them, he is the one who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love him and show myself to him.\" John 14:20-21\n \n Christ says that he is IN all the disciples, an impossible claim if he was only a man, or even an angel. But since Jesus is God, and since God is omnipresent, it therefore makes perfect sense for Christ to say he is able to dwell in all the believers at the same time.\n \n Finally:\n \n \"Jesus replied, 'If anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him, and WE will come to him and make OUR home with him.'\" John 14:23\n Both the Father and the Son make their home with all true believers! Christ is clearly claiming co-equality with the Father since he is present with every believer in the same way that the Father is!\n \n In light of the foregoing, it is quite clear what the Lord Jesus meant that the Father was greater than him. The Scriptures teach that when Christ became a man, he assumed the role and position of a slave/servant:\n \n \"For who is the greater, one who reclines at table or one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am among you as the one who serves.\" Luke 22:27\n \n \"Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going back to God, rose from supper. He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, tied it around his waist. Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him. He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, 'Lord, do you wash my feet?' Jesus answered him, 'What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand.' Peter said to him, 'You shall never wash my feet.\" Jesus answered him, 'If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.' Simon Peter said to him, 'Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!' Jesus said to him, 'The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not every one of you.' For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, 'Not all of you are clean.' When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, 'Do you understand what I have done to you? You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you.'\" John 13:3-15\n \n \"Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.\" Philippians 2:5-8\n \n Thus, as long as Christ remained on earth in the form and position of a humble slave, enduring persecution, insults, injury, and subsequently the shame of the cross, the Father would be greater in position and honor. Once Christ returns to heaven to be seated alongside his Father, he would no longer be in that state of humiliation. He would share, once again, that same divine glory and sovereign authority that he had with the Father before he had come to the earth as a man:\n \n http://answering-islam.org/Shamoun/q_father_greater.htm\n \n Jesus is Lord!",

For example, I also can't prove that there's no such thing as magical flying pink unicorns, but I certainly can hold to the position that there aren't any, without it being \"intellectually dishonest\" to do so.\n \n Can you prove that Jesus's shredded up corse isn't in orbit around Pluto? Nope. Then using your own logic, you can't claim that such is not the case! And if Jesus' corpse in in orbit around Pluot, then Jesus is dead and isn't the Messiah.
