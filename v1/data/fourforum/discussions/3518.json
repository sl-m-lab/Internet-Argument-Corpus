   "Do I think they are true?\n \n Do I agree with the majority of people on this Zogby poll?\n http://www.911truth.org/dossier/zogby911.pdf\n \n 14. No atomic, chemical or biological weapons have been found in Iraq. Yet many officials in our government, including the President, repeatedly told us they were there.Do you agree or disagree that these officials deliberately misled the public about the threat Iraq posed to America?\n \n Agree. (51%)\n \n 15. The 9/11 Commission has now completed its report. Do agree or disagree that it answered all the important questions about what actually happened on September 11th, 2001?\n \n Disagree. (39%)\n \n 17. Some have argued that some leaders in the U.S. government knew in advance that attacks were planned on or around September 11, 2001, and that they consciously failed to take action. Do you agree or disagree with this argument?\n \n Agree (41%)\n \n 18. The 911 victims' families who lobbied to create the 9/11 Commission filed nearly 400 questions with the commission. The majority of the questions were not addressed. Do you agree or disagree that either the Congress or the New York Attorney General should re-open the 9/11 investigation to examine the still unanswered questions?\n \n Agree. (56%)\n \n \n \n Are these true?\n \nFormer Treasure Secratery Paul O'Neill testified that at their first Cabinet meeting in January, 2001, Iraq oil concession maps were circulated & discussed and that Bush baldly told them to \"find me a way\" to take Iraq. Preparations followed.\n\n \n\n In June 2001 Cheney took charge of the Counterterrorism Task Force but never convened a single meeting, and Rumsfeld rewrote the NORAD/FAA air emergency response protocols (which had worked flawlessly 67 times the previous year) to include himself in the authorization chain.\n\n \n If these and other things are indeed true, then it points me very strongly into the direction that Bush, et al. let their guard down long enough for \"operation big wedding\" (AQ code name for the 9/11 attacks) to go through. If the plan for the new american century was going to start to come to fruition, they needed an attack. \n \n Why was Pakistan ISI Director, LTC Mahmood Ahmed having breakfast with Porter Goss on the morning of 9/11, not long after wiring $100K+ to Mohammed Atta? (google)\n http://www.melbourne.indymedia.org/news/2004/08/76366.php\n \n I went looking for the link PPT slideshow that I downloaded. It spelled everything out but I could only come up with this:\n http://www.summeroftruth.org/images/karl_schwarz.ppt\n It goes into more detail about who gains what from 9/11.\n It doesn't go into the details that the other one went into regarding why the people in charge of the 9/11 comission should not have been.\n \n Ah! Found it. \n Well, you'll probably dismiss this one, because it lumps 9/11 in with Kennedy, Pearl Harbor, and other \"conspiracies.\"\n http://septembereleventh.org/documents/Introduction_r1.pdf\n http://septembereleventh.org/documents/Chapt_1_r1.pdf\n http://septembereleventh.org/documents/Chapt_2-4_r1.pdf\n http://septembereleventh.org/documents/Chapt_5-7_r1.pdf\n http://septembereleventh.org/documents/Chapt_8-10_r1.pdf\n \n I would just look at the last one.\n \n Here's another PPT:\n http://www.summeroftruth.org/images/911.ppt\n \n More:http://www.mediamonitors.net/mosaddeq37.html\n \n There are plenty of theories out there that seem to feed on each other.\n The only problem with them is that none of us \"regular folk\" can verify most of the information.",

They even had plans to invade Afghanistan before 2001 was out (before 9/11) to displace the Taliban and take control of the region for the Caspian pipeline. \n \n Well, actually, the invasion of Iraq was \"rushed\" (maybe hurried is a better word) so that the UN inspectors wouldn't have time to find out that there were no WMDs. If there weren't then we wouldn't have any excuse to invade and occupy. \n \n .",
