   "When Richard Perle, chairman of the Pentagon's defence policy board, was working for Senator Scoop Jackson in the 1970s, he was investigated by the Justice Department and found to have violated US policies relating to unlawful transmission of sensitive classified US information to Israel.\n \n See Paul Findley's They Dare To Speak Out, (Chicago, Lawrence Hill Books 1989), Chapter 5, Penetrating the Defense at Defense -- and State, page 160:\n \n \n\"An FBI summary of a 1970 wiretap recorded Perle discussing classified information with someone at the Israeli embassy. He came under fire in 1983 when newspapers reported he received substantial payments to represent the interests of an Israeli weapons company. Perle denied conflict of interest, insisting that, although he received payment for these services after he had assumed his position in the Defense Department, he was between government jobs when he worked for the Israeli firm.\" \n\n \n Interesting. When John Pollard was caught passing U.S. defence secrets to Israel, who usually pass them on to Red China, he was sent to prison for life. Interesting how Israel's \"War on Terror\" becomes America's War on Terror. Thank you Richard Perle, Israeli agent. Thank you Paul Wolfowitz, good friend of Richard Perle. A special thank you goes out to all the Neoconservative Jews with dual citizenship in Israel, who spend all day promoting war against all of Israel's enemies. Thank you Mossad agents filming the destruction of the World Trade Center celebrating. Israel is always willing to fight to the last American.\n \n http://abcnews.go.com/sections/2020/DailyNews/2020_whitevan_020621.html",
