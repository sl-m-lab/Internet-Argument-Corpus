The more DNA research that is completed, the more confusion about DNA and the unanswered questions of that 75% of so-called junk DNA arises. Mitochondrial DNA, the Human Genome, and the debatable existence of transitional fossils (depends on what scientist your talking to) all raise questions there really are no answers for----just hypothesis and theory.\n \n Is there such a thing as Micro-Evolution? Hell yeah, I have witnessed it in my lifetime----children are growing bigger and stronger than ever before, and whether it is because of nutrition and better medicinal care does nor matter----it's Micro-Evolution none-the-less. Many equate the evolutionary theory with a tornado striking a junk yard, pulling some car parts into its vortex, and laying down a perfectly assembled car in a parking lot five miles away. 2nd Law of thermodynamics say's this cannot happen, yet that is the evolutionary theory.\n \n Scientists cannot even get together on the dates modern Homo Sapien first walked the earth. Seemingly, every year there is some form of new fossil discovered, raising even more questions about the mass diaspora of population out of Africa. How many species co-existed at the same time? Which one was the true species in the human evolutionary change?\n \n Many people point to the Chimp and Bobo as being the closest related mammal to humans on the planet. Scientist's claim anwhere from 98%-99% similarities in our Genomes----well, that's only about 40 Billion gene sequences that are different. And, if we are related to the Chimp, why didn't they evolve? Nope, I certainly do not believe God put Adam & Eve down here on the Planet 6000 years ago, but I cannot say I am confident in the evolutionary research up to this point either.\n \n Boils down to this; I have a ton of questions, but I do not have any answers. To believe Human life started approximately 6000 years ago is totally naive, but asking me to believe I come from a chimp seems no less ridiculous to me. To believe in evolution we have to believe that life was triggered by some form of prebiotic soup filled with enzymes, protiens, ammino acids, etc. In this modern day and age, no scientist as of yet has ever been able to prove the prebiotic soup theory---so technically, the Macro-Evolutionary theory, is just that----A highly educated guess and still just a theory.",

Mitochondrial DNA, the Human Genome, and the debatable existence of transitional fossils (depends on what scientist your talking to) all raise questions there really are no answers for----just hypothesis and theory.\n \n Is there such a thing as Micro-Evolution? Hell yeah, I have witnessed it in my lifetime----children are growing bigger and stronger than ever before, and whether it is because of nutrition and better medicinal care does nor matter----it's Micro-Evolution none-the-less. Many equate the evolutionary theory with a tornado striking a junk yard, pulling some car parts into its vortex, and laying down a perfectly assembled car in a parking lot five miles away. 2nd Law of thermodynamics say's this cannot happen, yet that is the evolutionary theory.\n \n Scientists cannot even get together on the dates modern Homo Sapien first walked the earth. Seemingly, every year there is some form of new fossil discovered, raising even more questions about the mass diaspora of population out of Africa. How many species co-existed at the same time? Which one was the true species in the human evolutionary change?\n \n Many people point to the Chimp and Bobo as being the closest related mammal to humans on the planet. Scientist's claim anwhere from 98%-99% similarities in our Genomes----well, that's only about 40 Billion gene sequences that are different. And, if we are related to the Chimp, why didn't they evolve? Nope, I certainly do not believe God put Adam & Eve down here on the Planet 6000 years ago, but I cannot say I am confident in the evolutionary research up to this point either.\n \n Boils down to this; I have a ton of questions, but I do not have any answers. To believe Human life started approximately 6000 years ago is totally naive, but asking me to believe I come from a chimp seems no less ridiculous to me. To believe in evolution we have to believe that life was triggered by some form of prebiotic soup filled with enzymes, protiens, ammino acids, etc. In this modern day and age, no scientist as of yet has ever been able to prove the prebiotic soup theory---so technically, the Macro-Evolutionary theory, is just that----A highly educated guess and still just a theory.\n\n \n Well, that shows a lot of ignorance about what a scientific theory is, and what evolutionary theory is. Evolutionary theory does not say that man came from a chimp, it says that man and chimp come from a common ancestor.. \n \n You are also mixing up the hypothesis of abiogensis with the theory of evolution. Work on how life was formed from non-life is still in it's infancy, but much further along that Creationists ever dreamed possible. As for the 'prebiotic soup', why, just look at the latest observations from Titan. They found that there are complex organic compounds in the atmosphere of Titan, something they did not expect. That very strongly reinforces the idea that there was a 'prebiotic' soup on earth 3 billion years ago. \n \n There is a difference between 'biological evolution' and the theory of evolution. A theory is a model that trys to explain why things happen. Evolution, including the so-called 'macro' evolution has been observed in nature. The theory of evolution is a model on trying to figure out WHY it happens. So far, after 150 years of intense trying, it has not been able to be falsified.",

   "With regard to thermodynamics, the entropy increases with time condition is a result of statistical macro physics. It is entirely possible for order to emerge from disorder, just highly unlikely. Added to that there is the issue of the existence of stars, galaxies and planets instead of uniform particle soup which apparently violates thermodynamics. I'm a theoretical physics student, my suspicion is that applying the laws of thermodynamics to the world in general beyond their stated conditions is an excercise in extrapolation, which I can say as a maths student (double major ;) ) is very risky indeed. Even if the laws of thermodynamics do apply, the nature of entropy is such that patterns can emerge without compromising the chaotic nature of the system.

It has been estimated that our \"Scientific Knowledge\" doubles every 10-years. Guess what? They still make mistakes.\n \n Debbie Harris is a Particle Physicist from Fermilabs who is currently doing research on the Einstein Papers published 100 years ago which changed the way we looked at the Universe. Some of her findings are meeting resistance among the Scientific Community effecting the dollar support of her experiments.\n \n \"Her work\" Counterbalanced by researchers who study deep space----comes as physicists hope they are on the brink of the next frontier.\n \n Einstein's Theories left several holes, primarily contradictions between quantum mechanics, which explains forces at the subatomic level, and general relativity, which describes forces on a large scale, such as gravity between planets.\n \n The Challenge now is to overcome those contradictions with a new \"theory to everything,\" to explain and unite all the known forces of the Universe\"\n \n I really did get an 'A'.

   "PREDICTION: Evidencing that which is universally considered impossible equates to Divine involvement.\n \n Specific Prediction:\n \n Ultra-scientific (Great Pyramid) produced in ultra-NON scientific time period (2700 BC): Great Pyramid (singular) in the center of the Nile-Delta Quadrant.\n \n Why is the Great Pyramid called a World Wonder ?\n \n Answer: Because nobody knows how it was built because of WHEN it was built.\n \n Atheist Egyptology ASSERTS via individual educational credentials that common Egyptians in 2700 BC somehow managed to build a World Wonder.\n \n IOW, North African sun worshippers erected a monument that still baffles modern man.\n \n Common sense rejects these opinions because they are not based on any facts.\n \n The facts about to be presented falsifies the assertions of atheist Egyptology to literally be a pack of lies.\n \n The only \"evidence\" that Egyptians built the GP are assertions assuming they did because it resides in Egypt. The Suez Canal is in Egypt and we know the British built it.\n \n Isaiah 46:9,10\n \n Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me, \n \n Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure\n \n The evidence forthcoming says the Great Pyramid is the \"END FROM THE BEGINNING\".\n \n IF the Great Pyramid IS the central Bible claims in stone then this proves the Bible BEFORE it was written and becomes proto-prophecy prior to the prophetic claims of the Bible.\n \n For puposes here it does not matter WHEN the Bible was written except that it is universally agreed that it was written prior to 2700 BC.\n \n All scholarship agrees the GP was built no later than 2700 BC, therefore, IF the GP SOMEHOW encases the central claims of the yet to be written Bible, then this is the God of Isaiah \"DECLARING THE END FROM THE BEGINNING\".\n \n CONTRAST OF IMPOSSIBILITY\n \n A scientific World Wonder built in a universally agreed unscientifc time period -2700 BC. = Divine involvement.\n \n I contend the Great Pyramid was Designed by the God of the Bible to encase the central Biblical claims (yet to be written).\n \n Everyone agrees the GP is a scientific wonder but certain elements of our society abandon all common sense and assert ancient men somehow gained the know-how and ability then somehow lost it - all without any evidence.\n \n Isaiah 19:19,20\n \n In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD. \n \n And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the LORD because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour, and a great one, and he shall deliver them. \n \n NILE-DELTA QUADRANT by Dr. E. Raymond Capt, \"Great Pyramid Decoded\", pages 12, 13:\n \n \"The Great Pyramid of Gizeh stands at the geometric center and yet at the southern extremity of the Quadrant. The southern extremity, being the northenmost edge of the Giza plateau where the Great Pyramid stands looking over the fan-shaped sector of Egypt, was in ancient times at the boundary where the cultivated land touched the desert. This plateau was called Giza, which is the Arabic word for edge or border. It was this unusual location that first suggested the Great Pyramid was the monument spoken of in the Scriptures by Isaiah the prophet. Since the full official name of the Pyramid, the Great Pyramid of Giza, means, in English, the Great Pyramid of the Border, the answer to the apparently contradictory defintion of Isaiah is found in the Great Pyramid. The only spot on the face of the Earth that completely answers this description, both geometrically and geographically, is the precise place where the Great Pyramid actually stands.\" \n \n http://www.egyptarchive.co.uk/his_html/smyth_20.html\n \n Map produced by the United States Coast Survey, Henry Mitchell 1868\n source: Peter Lemesurier, \"Decoding the Great Pyramid\" [1977]\n \n The Isaiah 19 verses say there is an altar to the Lord that is in the middle of Egypt AND a pillar at the border thereof.\n \n IOW, whatever object the verse is talking about is located in the middle of Egypt and at its border.\n \n Middle: Center of Nile-Delta Quadrant.\n \n Border: Division between Upper and Lower Egypt.\n \n Only the GP satisfies these requirements. Only in Egypt can you be in the center/middle AND on the border (Upper/Lower Egypt).\n \n The GP is located on this exact spot = object in Isaiah 19 is the GP.\n \n The object is descibed as an:\n \n Altar: There are two meanings for this word;\n \n a) A place of death where the authority of a Deity is recognized.\n \n b) A place of testimony.\n \n The 20th verse cofirms that b is the correct rendering because it says a sign and a witness to the Lord. [source: Dr. Gene Scott Ph.D. Stanford University]\n \n Pillar: A pillar in Hebrew is \"matstsebah\"/monument and is synonymous with an object that is built/stone.\n \n Thus the object of Isaiah 19 is:\n \n Altar in the middle of Egypt.\n \n Pillar at the border.\n \n Altar = testimony/witness.\n \n Pillar = monument of stone.\n \n Fact: The only object that easily fulfills ALL these requirements is the GP as it stands in the middle of the Nile-Delta Quadrant AND on the border of Upper and Lower Egypt AND it is a stone monument of which its witness and testimony is about to be evidenced further.\n \n By the way, if you add up all the Hebrew letters of the Isaiah 19:19,20 verses the grand total equals the height of the GP from its base to the original summit platform. Hebrew letters each have a numeric equivalent and the total from the verses which identify the GP in the Bible = its height = impossible = prediction supported.\n \n http://members.tripod.com/conifer.co/pyramid_scripture.htm\n \n Now, lets OBSERVE the central Bible claims in stone:\n \n \n http://www.gizapyramid.com/map20.jpg\n \n Click on the above image which depicts the internal passage system of the Great Pyramid.\n \n Point #1 to point #14 symbolizes the Biblical claim that man is on a downward path to hell/the pit.\n \n Points 1 to 14 is the long descending passage which abruptly ends in the pit.\n \n Thus far I am claiming this represents the Biblical claim of mankind doomed in a downward path to hell.\n \n Corroboration of claim:\n \n Sources:\n \n Dr. E. Raymond Capt M.A., A.I.A., F.S.A., SCOT\n \"The Great Pyramid Decoded\" [Artisan Sales, 1971]\n \n Dr. Adam Rutherford F.R.A.S., F.R.G.S., in Egypt 1925, 1950, 1963-5\n \"Pyramidology Book 1\" [London, 1957]\n \n Peter Lemesurier; \"Decoding the Great Pyramid\" [London, 1977]\n \n According to Sir John Herschel, Astronomer Royal of England (discoverer of the planet Uranus) and Professor C. Piazzi Smyth, Astronomer Royal for Scotland:\n \n The long descending passage is aligned to true north, that the angle of decline is in direct alignment with the pole star/North star.\n \n Polaris is the pole star/North star today and its light shines down into that passage but only partially as the alignment is off. When researchers discovered this they immediately set out to determine if any pole star/North star ever was in perfect aligment to shine its light all the way to the bottom.\n \n According to all the sources cited above, ONLY in 2141 BC did the light of the pole star/North star shine down to the bottom of the descending passage.\n \n The precession of the Equinoxes is about a 26 thousand year cycle, this means that about every 2000 years the pole star/North star will change.\n \n Dr E. Raymond Capt excerpt: (The Great Pyramid Decoded, page 11)\n \n \"That the Architect knew where to find the poles of the Earth is evidenced by the high degree of accuracy in orienting the (Pyramid) true north. Modern man's best effort, the Paris Observatory, is six minutes of degrees off true north. The Great Pyramid today is only off three minutes and that after 4200 years, due mainly to subsidence. [and/or continental drift]\n \n Again, ultra-scientific (alignment to true North) achieved in ultra-non-scientific time period (2700 BC) = prediction of impossibility supported.\n \n If the Paris Observatory in modern times can only get within six minutes of degrees off true north then the three minutes of the GP is astounding to say the least.\n \n In 2141 BC the pole star/North star was Thuban (which means \"subtle\"/Genesis 3 \"the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field\") of Alpha Draconis the Dragon Star.\n \n http://www.glyphweb.com/esky/default.htm?http://www.glyphweb.com/esky/concepts/northerncelestialpole.html\n \n \"For the ancient Egyptians, the Pole Star was not Polaris, but Thuban in Draco\"  \n \n http://www.shareintl.org/archives/Science-tech/sci_rrPisces2Aquarius.htm\n \n \"At the time the pyramids were built, during the Age of Aries, the astronomers of Egypt referenced the pole star Alpha Draconis.\"\n \n The purpose of the two links above is to further support WHICH Pole Star the Descending Passage is aligned to, and to support that Thuban was the Pole Star during the believed timeframe when the GP was built.\n \n Now back to the symbolism of points 1 to 14:\n \n Man under the influence of Satan, also known as the Dragon in Scripture is headed downwards to the pit/hell.\n \n Now please refer back to the diagram and find point #5 where the first ascending passage projects upwards.\n \n Point 5 to point #7 symbolizes the intrusion of God via Mosaic Law and the miraculous Red Sea deliverance from Egypt.\n \n Just above point 5 is a blackened area.\n \n This depicts the 3 granite plugs blocking the ascending passage which are still in place today if you were to visit the GP.\n \n Those who first penetrated the GP in the Dark Ages bore a passage way around them which of course still exists today.\n \n Interpretation:\n \n The FIRST intrusion to stop man on his downward path to hell under the influence of Satan/Dragon was the Exodus from Egypt and Sinai Law.\n \n The 3 granite plugs symbolize that only the miracle of the Red Sea parting could begin the journey and reception of God's law on Mt. Sinai.\n \n There are many insane senseless reasons to explain WHY someone would place 3 granite plugs preventing ascent up the passage. Egyptology says it was to prevent tomb robbery. Only problem is no mummy of funerary objects were ever found IN the GP. \n \n Points 5 to 7 is a passage that a person must stoop and bend over in order to scale. The passage is like a tunnel and it is not high enough to walk upright in.\n \n This depicts the CONDITIONS and DURATION of Mosaic Law.\n \n O.T. law is agreed to be harsh and impossible code of conduct = the first ascending passage typified as having to bend over while ascending UP away from the descent of the descending passage that leads to the pit/hell.\n \n At this point, to decrease the length of this post I will refrain from posting the corroborating evidence at this time. I will briefly cite it:\n \n Point #4 is whats called \"Scored Lines\" etched into the wall of the descending passage. The angle of these lines extended into space intersects with Alcyone in the Pleiades mentioned in the book of Job. \"Alcyone\" means \"sweet influences\" of God.\n \n Only in 2141 BC did the alignment of the Scored Lines with Alcyone and the alignment of Thuban/Draco with the descending passage occur.\n \n Thus at point #4 marks 2141 BC in calendar history. If you measure in Pyamid inches from point 4 to point 7 it arrives at 1453 BC the date of the Exodus out of Egypt. (please see my topic in the History Forum evidencing this date from history)\n \n Pyramid inch = 1/1000th of an inch longer than the British inch corrected to its true length.\n \n All scholarship agrees the Bible dates the Exodus in the mid-15th century. Many disagree with this claim to be a historical fact, but in this context, it doesn't matter: the Biblical claim is corroborated. I will confirm this dating and alleged prophetic chronograph further ahead in my argument.\n \n But back to the specific point here:\n \n Points 5 to 7:\n \n Exodus miracle (to get out of Egypt and escape the Egyptians via the Red Sea parting) = 3 plugs = only a miracle allows the ascent under law to begin = passage symbolism perfectly depicts Bible claims.\n \n Point 7 = death and Resurrection of Christ.\n \n The first ascending passage suddenly expands upwards into what is called the Grand Gallery = age of grace where man can walk upright with God free from the harsh requirements of Mosaic Law.\n \n The measured distance from point 5 to 7 gives the date 33 AD.\n \n What happened in 33 AD ?\n \n All mainstream scholarship say this is the year Christ died.\n \n The passage symbolism depicts the age of grace accomplished by the death and Resurrection of Christ. The jurisdiction of Mosaic Law ENDS when Christ dies says the New Testament.\n \n On the diagram find the Well Shaft.\n \n It breaks open into the long descending passage just above point #13 and extends upwards and breaks open at the top at point 7.\n \n The Well Shaft symbolizes the Resurrection of Christ.\n \n Only a miarcle of God can deliver us from the downward path which leads to the pit/hell and place us into the great grace of God in the Grand Gallery.\n \n Its no accident that point #7 is where 4 things converge:\n \n 1) End of Law.\n \n 2) Death of Christ.\n \n 3) Resurrection of Christ.\n \n 4) Age of Grace\n \n The passage symbolism depicts these written Biblical claims perfectly.\n \n The 4-fold convergence according to the 1 inch = 1 year prophetic chronograph is 33 AD. The totality of the converging symbolism point to the death and Resurrection of Christ. The fact that mainstream scholarship agrees that Christ died in 33 AD makes point #7 a benchmark date in the calendar and confirmed by the symbolism.\n \n Measure the inches ANYWHERE from this particular point and the 1453 BC date of Exodus is confirmed and the Scored Lines astronomic line-up of 2141 BC is also confirmed.\n \n What if you measure upwards beyond the Grand Gallery ?\n \n Well lets not get ahead of ourselves here......\n \n Because of the length of this post I will stop now, but be assured there are many more layers of spectacular evidence which will confirm all of the above.\n \n Thus far we OBSERVE the central Bible claims depicted in the internal passage ways of the GP.\n \n Isaiah 46 \"declaring the end from the beginning\" is irrefutably supported.\n \n Of course, implacable opponents can assert contrary in defiance of all logic, evidence, facts, and observations anyway.\n \n Ray Martinez",

This is simply false. We've got a very good understanding of how the pyramids were built. Do we know every detail? No. Ray, do you know every detail of exactly how the Suez Canal was built?

What is your basis for this? (It's almost as though you believe in \"evolution\" here Ray, the idea that humans have become more intelligent with time, I thought God created all humans in his image? Which is it?) \n \n What of the pyramids and cities of the Maya? Incas? Did God visit them too?\n \n The entire assertion is fraudulent.\n \n Thirdly, as has been pointed out, the use of a false dichotomy. Simply because we can't fully explain how something was done, does not mean God did it. Break it down to a simple single point case - Can you explain how your computer works, in detail? No? Well then clearly the tooth fairy designed your computer. \n \n As to the Bible scripture and the \"corroborating evidence\", I'm not a Bible scholar, I have witnessed the fact that just about anything can be \"corroborated\" to the Bible depending on one's interpretation.\n \n I know I'm just a simple minded Darwinist blinded by my pre-conceived atheistic world view (thought I'd save you some typing :p ), but IMHO, you've completely failed to supply the proof you've promised.\n \n Waxy",

   "hmmm... ray, after reading through your lengthy presentation, i must say, though its interesting, its entire structure will fall apart on the falsifying of 1 premise: the assumption that the great pyramid was predicted by isiah. \n \n added to this is the questionable superimposing of the phrase \"the end from the beginning\". this really sounds arbitrary, but lets leave it as it is...\n \n has it occured to you that there is a very real possibility that the pyramid both predates isiah, and that the legends within the pyramid were adopted into the hebrew culture? there is a large amount of lore in the hebrew culture, much of which is found in the bible, that are no more than adaptations of other cultures' history and folklore. what was recorded in isiah was very likely their version of the egyptian monumented that may have baffled them as much as it does us. no doubt, the hebrew culture borrows a lot from egypt, with their added hebrew \"flavor\" (which usually consists of gross exagerrations and the inclusion of God somewhere)\n \n your observation also makes a very strange argument. first of all it says that it was made as an atlar to God, then it makes a point that it was aligned with the \"subtle dragon\" star when it was built. not only is this making a lot of empty assuptions, but it also creates a conflict of explanation: if the pyramid was really an altar, was it in honor of Gor or satan?\n \n we have discussed many instances where what seems to be biblical original lore was actually hebrew versions of much older tales. for example, the communion/last supper actually originated in egypt as an act of worship to the sun God. and just recently, we discussed the fact that there was no noah's flood, and that the entire story is a hebrew adoption of the epic of gilgamesh, with some gross exagerrations added. it would seem that borrowing stories from elsewhere, adding hyperboles, and mentioning God, was a very common way for the israelites to create their history, culture and laws. and they inevitably end up in the bible, where it is sold as fact",

This has been confirmed by oxygen isotope analysis.\n \n Normal marine salinities are indicated by the fossil assemblage which comprises a normal marine assemblage which does not include species thought to be representative of lower salinity environments such as estuaries.\n \n The Chalk of NW Europe was deposited on the continental shelf during the earliest stages of the opening of the Atlantic Ocean (Biscay to Labradore opening at the beginning of Chalk deposition) . The sea level was much higher than the present day with the Chalk of Kent typically being deposited in a depth range of 100-300m. The sea levels varied through its deposition. However, not all Chalk was deposited at this depth with some marginal (shallow) marine deposits being recorded both in Devon and NW France.\n \n The Chalk often shows a distinctive cyclicity (on a 1m or so scale) which has been linked to variation in the climate at the time of deposition (Milankovitch cycles).\n \n The lack of coarser clastic material in the majority of the Chalk, with quartz being most common in the clay size grade, indicates clear seas with minimal eroded products being transported from the landmasses at the time. Indeed, much of the clay sized quartz and clay may be airborn and of volcanic origin.\n\n \n It's all nicely laid out for you in a concise answer if you'd bother. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n Now you've heard the answer. \n \n You may also want to look into shales and other homogeneous clastic and carbonate rocks that form in much the same depositional manner.

   "Hey guys, apparently god needed ramps to build this thing!\n \n http://www.guardians.net/hawass/pbuildrs.htm\n \n \nThese holes are set at regular intervals and form lines which run parallel to the sides of the pyramid. The best indication for the reason behind these holes is for stakes that carried a line used as a reference, by the builders, as they formed the base of Khufu's pyramid from blocks of limestone, or in the case of Khafre's pyramid, from granite. These fifteen-ton blocks are marked so as to define the center axis of the pyramid's faces and diagonals. There are also trenches that infer the infusion and drainage of water during and after the leveling operations.\n\n \n and\n \n \nOn the South side of the paved road, South of Khufu's pyramid, we excavated down about 2.50 meters and found another part of the ramp. This part is in line with the Eastern and Western wall and is of similar construction. This discovery proves that the ramp led from the quarry to the Southwest comer of the pyramid and was made of stone rubble and Tafla.(see plans 2,3) The ramp rises to about 30 meters above the pyramid's base at its Southwest comer. The ramp would have leaned against the pyramid's faces as they rose. Somewhat like accretion layers wrapped around the pyramid with a roadway on top. The weight of this ramp is borne by the ground around the pyramid. Traffic could move along the top of this structure as both pyramid and ramp rose in tandem. The top of the pyramid could be reached with only one and one quarter turns. The slope would rise with each turn from a reasonable 65 degrees, for the first section, to as much as 18 degrees for the last climb to the apex.\n\n \n Let me guess. When satan was going around burying all the fossils to fool us into thinking evolution was true, he installed a few ramps and drains to make it look like god didn't build the pyramid! emoticon_rolleyes",

When multiple explanations are available for a phenomenon, the simplest version is preferred. A charred tree on the ground could be caused by a landing alien ship or a lightning strike. According to Occam's Razor, the lightning strike is the preferred explanation as it requires the fewest assumptions.\n\n \n Nice cut and paste job from Wikipedia there peddler8111 emoticon_xgood\n \n \nEvolution makes lots of unbelievably complicated assumptions -gradualism -punctuated equilibrium - RM+ NS -Panspermia-Spontaneous Generation- the list is endless.\n Occam's Razors agrees with Creation not evolution. Paleys watchmaker theory is an example. Things that look designed are designed. A design requires a designer. A Creation requires a Creator. Information requires a sender and a receiver. Dogs have always been dogs etc.\n\n \n Occam's Razor does not agree with young earth creation at all. Creationism has far, far less detail than evolution, but its assumptions are infinitely less testable and measurable- much like the alien space ship in your paragraph borrowed from wikipedia.\n \n \nIt most certainly not the simplest explanation that matter created intelligence-that matter created information. That small variation add up to completely different kinds of plants and animals with a common ancestor, a rock.\n You cannot seem to understand that evidence has to be interpreted and naturalism is religion , not science.
