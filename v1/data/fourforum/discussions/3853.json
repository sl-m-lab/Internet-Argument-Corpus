   "I think this would qualify under \"health\"\n \n \nSome Abstinence Programs Mislead Teens, Report Says\n \n By Ceci Connolly\n Washington Post Staff Writer\n Thursday, December 2, 2004; Page A01 \n \n Many American youngsters participating in federally funded abstinence-only programs have been taught over the past three years that abortion can lead to sterility and suicide, that half the gay male teenagers in the United States have tested positive for the AIDS virus, and that touching a person's genitals \"can result in pregnancy,\" a congressional staff analysis has found. \n \n Those and other assertions are examples of the \"false, misleading, or distorted information\" in the programs' teaching materials, said the analysis, released yesterday, which reviewed the curricula of more than a dozen projects aimed at preventing teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease. \n \n \"I don't think we ought to lie to our children about science,\" said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.), left, who led the congressional staff analysis. (Ray Lustig -- The Washington Post) \n \n In providing nearly $170 million next year to fund groups that teach abstinence only, the Bush administration, with backing from the Republican Congress, is investing heavily in a just-say-no strategy for teenagers and sex. But youngsters taking the courses frequently receive medically inaccurate or misleading information, often in direct contradiction to the findings of government scientists, said the report, by Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.), a critic of the administration who has long argued for comprehensive sex education. \n \n Several million children ages 9 to 18 have participated in the more than 100 federal abstinence programs since the efforts began in 1999. Waxman's staff reviewed the 13 most commonly used curricula -- those used by at least five programs apiece. \n \n The report concluded that two of the curricula were accurate but the 11 others, used by 69 organizations in 25 states, contain unproved claims, subjective conclusions or outright falsehoods regarding reproductive health, gender traits and when life begins. In some cases, Waxman said in an interview, the factual issues were limited to occasional misinterpretations of publicly available data; in others, the materials pervasively presented subjective opinions as scientific fact. \n \n Among the misconceptions cited by Waxman's investigators: \n \n \u0095 A 43-day-old fetus is a \"thinking person.\" \n \n \u0095 HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, can be spread via sweat and tears. \n \n \u0095 Condoms fail to prevent HIV transmission as often as 31 percent of the time in heterosexual intercourse. \n \n One curriculum, called \"Me, My World, My Future,\" teaches that women who have an abortion \"are more prone to suicide\" and that as many as 10 percent of them become sterile. This contradicts the 2001 edition of a standard obstetrics textbook that says fertility is not affected by elective abortion, the Waxman report said. \n \n \"I have no objection talking about abstinence as a surefire way to prevent unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases,\" Waxman said. \"I don't think we ought to lie to our children about science. Something is seriously wrong when federal tax dollars are being used to mislead kids about basic health facts.\" \n \n When used properly and consistently, condoms fail to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) less than 3 percent of the time, federal researchers say, and it is not known how many gay teenagers are HIV-positive. The assertion regarding gay teenagers may be a misinterpretation of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found that 59 percent of HIV-infected males ages 13 to 19 contracted the virus through homosexual relations. \n \n \"I don't think we ought to lie to our children about science,\" said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.), left, who led the congressional staff analysis. (Ray Lustig -- The Washington Post) \n \n Joe. S. McIlhaney Jr., who runs the Medical Institute for Sexual Health, which developed much of the material that was surveyed, said he is \"saddened\" that Waxman chose to \"blast\" well-intentioned abstinence educators when there is much the two sides could agree on. \n \n McIlhaney acknowledged that his group, which publishes \"Sexual Health Today\" instruction manuals, made a mistake in describing the relationship between a rare type of infection caused by chlamydia bacteria and heart failure. Chlamydia also causes a common type of sexually transmitted infection, but that is not linked to heart disease. But McIlhaney said Waxman misinterpreted a slide that warns young people about the possibility of pregnancy without intercourse. McIlhaney said the slide accurately describes a real, though small, risk of pregnancy in mutual masturbation. \n \n Congress first allocated money for abstinence-only programs in 1999, setting aside $80 million in grants, which go to a variety of religious, civic and medical organizations. To be eligible, groups must limit discussion of contraception to failure rates. \n \n President Bush has enthusiastically backed the movement, proposing to spend $270 million on abstinence projects in 2005. Congress reduced that to about $168 million, bringing total abstinence funding to nearly $900 million over five years. It does not appear that the abstinence-only curricula are being taught in the Washington area. \n \n Waxman and other liberal sex-education proponents argue that adolescents who take abstinence-only programs are ill-equipped to protect themselves if they become sexually active. According to the latest CDC data, 61 percent of graduating high school seniors have had sex. \n \n Supporters of the abstinence approach, also called abstinence until marriage, counter that teaching young people about \"safer sex\" is an invitation to have sex. \n \n Alma Golden, deputy assistant secretary for population affairs in the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement that Waxman's report is a political document that does a \"disservice to our children.\" Speaking as a pediatrician, Golden said, she knows \"abstaining from sex is the most effective means of preventing the sexual transmission of HIV, STDs and preventing pregnancy.\" \n \n Nonpartisan researchers have been unable to document measurable benefits of the abstinence-only model. Columbia University researchers found that although teenagers who take \"virginity pledges\" may wait longer to initiate sexual activity, 88 percent eventually have premarital sex. \n \n Bill Smith, vice president of public policy at the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, a comprehensive sex education group that also receives federal funding, said the Waxman report underscored the need for closer monitoring of what he called the \"shame-based, fear-based, medically inaccurate messages\" being disseminated with tax money. He said the danger of abstinence education lies in the omission of useful medical information. \n \n Some course materials cited in Waxman's report present as scientific fact notions about a man's need for \"admiration\" and \"sexual fulfillment\" compared with a woman's need for \"financial support.\" One book in the \"Choosing Best\" series tells the story of a knight who married a village maiden instead of the princess because the princess offered so many tips on slaying the local dragon. \"Moral of the story,\" notes the popular text: \"Occasional suggestions and assistance may be alright, but too much of it will lessen a man's confidence or even turn him away from his princess.\"\n\n \n That last paragraph really caught my attention. How rediculous is this?",

   "(article quote)Many American youngsters participating in federally funded abstinence-only programs have been taught over the past three years that abortion can lead to sterility and suicide, \n\n \n It indeed CAN. I think it's important to note that there is a HUGE difference in telling American youngsters that it \"most likely will\" as opposed to \"it can.\" Kids need to know the risks, no matter how small. It's nothing that a good doctor won't tell a woman having an abortion, noting the possible effects as they do any medical procedure.\n \n \n \nthat half the gay male teenagers in the United States have tested positive for the AIDS virus,\n\n \n If they truly say \"1/2\", then that is indeed an exagerration. However I don't think there is anything wrong with telling them the truth that the rate of HIV among people having gay sex is 3 to 4 times what it is among those having heterosexual sex. CDC stats show this as FACT.\n \n \n(and that touching a person's genitals \"can result in pregnancy,\" a congressional staff analysis has found. \n\n \n I suspect what is meant by this is that it can lead to if one thing leads to another. If a teenage couple is to point of touching each other, they're in danger of having sex and therefore someone getting pregnant.\n \n The real issue here is that there is a serious prejudice in this country against abstinence programs. We need to keep in mind that when something is termed \"abstinence-only\", it doesn't mean they are teaching the kids to not touch a condom or avoid birth control at all costs; it simply means \"abstinence only\" as opposed to having sex. We also need to remember that there have long been federal dollars being spent on programs that weren't required to have abstinence a part of the teaching (it wasn't taught when I was in health class, but we learned about condoms), so in essense we've had \"birth-control-only\" programs for many years now. Curriculum that teaches abstinence only, as opposed to having sex, is not a bad thing.",

My asseration is supported by the fact that such a industry is very much alive, and the only way they can stay afloat is if people use and buy their products. Therefore, since such a industry exists, people must be using condoms. As a collary, since they are using them, they must be willing to pay for such items.

You make a asseration and link evidence that does not prove it. Why is it then, that states that have such programs have on average, lower unwanted pregnancies and disease rates then states who have no such programs? Please, tell me, how is that a state that has multiple agencies that offer free condoms have lower problems then states without?

Furthermore, condoms lubricated with spermicides are no more effective than other lubricated condoms in protecting against the transmission of HIV and other STDs. In order to achieve the protective effect of condoms, they must be used correctly and consistently. Incorrect use can lead to condom slippage or breakage, thus diminishing their protective effect. Inconsistent use, e.g., failure to use condoms with every act of intercourse, can lead to STD transmission because transmission can occur with a single act of intercourse. \n \n \n Are they all Jesus Freaks as well?\n \n These are scientific facts.

   "Does that include the FDA?\n\n \n I don't see where the FDA states anything similar to You can use a condom every time you have sex; coat yourself with spermacide and carry birth control pills in handy autodispensers and the fact remains that if you are sexually promiscuous, you WILL get a disease. Again, where did you find that information, or rather disinformation? \n \n \n\n Condoms are not the magical talismans you people keep claiming they are.\n\n \n At least I don't lie about it.\n \n \n\n Abstinance works. You are arguing that telling people that they can participate in promiscuous behavior but giving them a semi-effective protective device is better than telling them not to do it. Fascinating logic, and probably the reason why STDs are on the rise.\n\n \n Please. How am I telling kids who are going to do it anyways regardless of what I tell them that it is okay? If you noticed, Absteience programs in Texas across the state led to a INCREASED sexual activity. Oh wauit, doesn't that refute your claim? Why is it that your plan leads to more problems? \n \n \n\n \"Safe sex\" is a misnomer. The only really safe sex is that between monogamous partners who remain faithful to each other.\n\n \n So? Your plan leads to more pregnancies, more abortions, and more disease transfer. \n \n \n\n I'll let the CDC spell it out for you:\n\n \n Thank you, your site only reinforces that with proper usage, there is very little risk. Considering how Absitence programs don't reduce sexual activity, but are proven to increase it, it seems utterly retarded to deny kids the proper information. \n \n \n \n These are scientific facts. And if you read down, you will see that despite people like you claiming condoms are the best method, they are ineffective against several forms of STDs.\n\n \n Oh wait, you're lying. There's nothing in the article that says that. \n \n \n\n Got that? They just don't work, period.\n\n \n On the contrary, you're lying again.\n \n \nLatex condoms, when used consistently and correctly, are highly effective in preventing the sexual transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.\n \n Laboratory studies have demonstrated that latex condoms provide an essentially impermeable barrier to particles the size of STD pathogens\n \n Latex condoms, when used consistently and correctly, are highly effective in preventing transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. In addition, correct and consistent use of latex condoms can reduce the risk of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including discharge and genital ulcer diseases. While the effect of condoms in preventing human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is unknown, condom use has been associated with a lower rate of cervical cancer, an HPV-associated disease. \n\n \n Do you even read your own sources? It just refuted your claim that it doesn't work. \n \n \n\n You see, I'm not claiming that this or that program is the way to stop STD spread, I am simply pointing out the obvious: that abstinance is the only way to avoid STDs.\n\n \n And you are being unrealistic. Do you even think abstinance will work in today's societ? teaching it exclusively had been proven to increase risky business. You would rather lie to kids, have them screw up and then blame them for such behavior? emoticon_rolleyes",

And with proper usage they are effective. \n\n \n Yes it does.\n \n Discharge Diseases, Including \n Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, and Trichomoniasis\n \n Discharge diseases, other than HIV\n Latex condoms, when used consistently and correctly, can reduce the risk of transmission of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. \n \n \n Gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis are termed discharge diseases because they are sexually transmitted by genital secretions, such as semen or vaginal fluids. HIV is also transmitted by genital secretions. \n \n Laboratory studies have demonstrated that latex condoms provide an essentially impermeable barrier to particles the size of STD pathogens. \n \n Theoretical basis for protection. The physical properties of latex condoms protect against discharge diseases such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis, by providing a barrier to the genital secretions that transmit STD-causing organisms. \n \n Epidemiologic studies that compare infection rates among condom users and nonusers provide evidence that latex condoms can protect against the transmission of chlamydia, gonorrhea and trichomoniasis. However, some other epidemiologic studies show little or no protection against these infections. Many of the available epidemiologic studies were not designed or conducted in ways that allow for accurate measurement of condom effectiveness against the discharge diseases. More research is needed to assess the degree of protection latex condoms provide for discharge diseases, other than HIV.  \n \n Is that clear enough for you, or do I have to paste the whole damn thing?\n \n \nHOW? How does fluid exchange occur outside of the area? have you USED  a condom at all? I have a sinking feeling you have never actually used one. SERIOUSLY! \n\n \n Again, I will do your homework for you:\n \n Theoretical basis for protection. Protection against genital ulcer diseases and HPV depends on the site of the sore/ulcer or infection. Latex condoms can only protect against transmission when the ulcers or infections are in genital areas that are covered or protected by the condom. Thus, consistent and correct use of latex condoms would be expected to protect against transmission of genital ulcer diseases and HPV in some, but not all, instances.\n \n \nWHAT FACTS?

Many of the available epidemiologic studies were not designed or conducted in ways that allow for accurate measurement of condom effectiveness against the genital ulcer diseases. No conclusive studies have specifically addressed the transmission of chancroid and condom use, although several studies have documented a reduced risk of genital ulcers in settings where chancroid is a leading cause of genital ulcers. More research is needed to assess the degree of protection latex condoms provide for the genital ulcer diseases.\n \n Got that? \n \n \nWhere are you getting this from?

You seem determined to argue with someone else, perhaps that hypothetical bible-thumper you think lives somewhere around here.\n \n If you bothered to read my posts in full and the citations I have given, you would see that I am not arguing that condoms are ineffective, merely that they are less effective than people like you are saying the are and that in terms of avoiding STDs, abstinance is better than a condom.\n \n I don't think anyone can realistically argue with that proposition. \n \n A condom is better than no protection at all, but it is not nearly as effective as its promoters make it out to be. In theory, a condom's latex barrier is proof against all of the pathogens described. \n \n However, theory and practice are two different things - as the CDC is very careful to note.\n \n Now you can continue to think you are scoring brilliant rhetorical points against a position I'm not actually taking, but you don't really need me here to do that, do you?\n \n \nFunny how that works.

Have you ever used a condom? How exactly is fluid transfer suppose to occur outside? Unless you have a sperm gland outside of your genitle area, that's ridiculous. \n\n \n Are you ignorant or merely disingenuous?\n \n Fluid exchange is not limited to semen alone. That is why condoms are more effective at stopping pregnancy than STDs.\n \n Friction during sex often happens outside the area covered by the condom. The condom only covers the base of the penis - not the entire region (unless you're wearing a rubber body suit). This means that friction between the labia and surrounding areas can lead to abrasions and fluid exchange. \n \n Because the condom does not cover that area, it is ineffective at stopping it.\n \n Often people are unaware of the extent of the friction until they are done, at which point it is too late.\n \n This is exactly what the CDC was talking about. Herpes, for example, does not require an exchange to semen to transmit. Repeated rubbing of the surrounding skin area will do nicely.\n \n Either you don't know that, or are pretending to be ignorant simply because you like to argue.\n \n Neither reflects well on you.\n \n \nGuess that refutes your asseration that condoms don't work at all.  \n\n \n I never said that. I said that against certain STDs they are ineffective - something that is unquestionably true.\n \n If the STD is based on the outer labia or the base of the penis beyond the condom, it is still possible to transmit even if the sex is \"by the book.\" That is what the CDC was talking about and why it is very clear to point out that the only safe sex comes through a long term exclusively monogamous relationship.\n \n If you mess around you WILL get STDs. It is a statistical certainty. I know people who have the sores and/or the antibiotics to prove it.\n \n \nPLEASE DO YOU READ YOUR ARTICLES? You're even citing things that you think are refuting me when they directly refute you! \n\n \n Nothing I have cited says condoms are 100 percent effective, nor does it say that \"safe sex\" is as good as abstinance or a long term exclusive monogamous relationship.\n \n If you can find these passages, please paste them in.\n \n What I have found, and pasted repeatedly, is that the effectiveness of condoms in actual use has not been conclusively documented.\n \n You are advocating something where you have no idea what the percentages are.\n \n They may be in the high nineties, or the low fifties, you simply don't know.\n \n I could not in good conscience advocate a public health strategy whose actual effectiveness was unknown.\n \n I want this to be clear: I believe condoms are better than nothing, but if they are effective in only half of the time, telling people they can have \"safe sex\" is a criminal act of misinformation.\n \n [quote]intersting how you have ignored the fact that you've lied in your post\n \n Interesting that you have launched personal attacks almost immediately, assuming you know my religion and personal behavior when you know neither.\n \n \nInteresting how you refuse to comment upon how both of your articles litterally say that condoms drastically reduce diease transfer. \n Interesting how you refuse to comment upon how one of your artcicles completely refutes your 20,000 number. \n Intersting how you are using unproven evidence to declare that condoms don't work at all while your own sources refute you.\n\n \n Okay, what is the actual disease reduction rate? Is there consensus? What is it?\n \n The fact is more research is needed before you go telling people that if they use condoms they can have sex whenever they want with whomever they want and they won't get sick.\n \n That is a lie.\n \n They are less likely to get sick than if they used no protection, but not less likely than if they abstained or limited themselves to one long-term exclusive partner.\n \n I will also point out that even if the protection rate is high (say 90 percent) that still means that ten percent of the population WILL get STDs. I view that as unacceptable.\n \n As I pointed out before, it is possible to \"drastically increase your protection\" while still positing lousy overall numbers.\n \n Using Saran Wrap is probably better than nothing - it may even \"drastically\" reduce your chances of getting an STD - but I doubt it is effective overall.\n \n So to review, the following are the best methods to avoid STDs, ranked in order of effectiveness:\n \n 1.

   "Then why did you say \"Got that? They just don't work, period.\"\n\n \n That is correct. The base of the penis is not covered by the condom, nor are the labia.

In fact, while evolution does support in specific cases, long term surivival is clearly aganist both. \n\n \n And long-term survival is also against contracting an STD. So using the same logic, one should practice abstinence or monogamy since the odds of survival are best, right?\n \n You can't have it both ways. Either we are slaves to our impulses or we aren't.\n \n If we are, then a whole slew of laws and social customs need to be cast aside.\n \n Otherwise, the question is one of controlling one's own behavior.\n \n \nThen your accusation is ejected. Btw: if you're going to use that as a side tactic, make sure it actually has some foundation. \n\n \n Huh?\n \n \nCite. \n\n \n You're kidding. Do you honestly believe that children with two parents in a stable home are as likely to do drugs, have promiscuous sex and engage in criminal activity as neglected ones from broken families? \n \n After five minutes with Google, here's what I found:\n \n The National Longitudinal Study on Adolescent Health, which includes data on 90,118 American adolescents, found that when adolescents feel connected to their parents (e.g., feelings of warmth, love and caring from parents) they are less likely than other adolescents to: suffer from emotional distress, have suicidal thoughts and behaviors, use violence, smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol or smoke marijuana. They also have their first sexual experience later than adolescents who are not connected to their parents.\n \n By the way, there's another point that I thought was interesting:\n \n Sexual experience, and particularly age at first intercourse, represent critical indicators of the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Youth who begin having sex at younger ages are exposed to these risks over a longer period of time. Because sexual intercourse during the teen years, especially first intercourse, is often unplanned, it is also often unprotected by contraception. In addition, research has shown that youth who have early sexual experience are more likely at later ages to have more sexual partners and more frequent intercourse.\n \n So basically, the ones that choose abstinence do better and the ones that don't, are much more likely to contract STDs.\n \n Furthermore, sexual promiscuity is more likely to lead to difficulties in other areas like relationships and personal mental health.\n \n No matter how you slice it, people who wait to have sex do better than those who don't. Condoms are pretty irrelevant.\n \n Thus we return to my point: this is about behavioral modification.\n \n \nThen you should have stated that such a number was completely fictional.\n\n \n It's not fictional, it's hypothetical. Get a grip. \n \n \nThe other article besides the CDC. Where it cites that out of 1,000, 996 must past a quality test. Therefore, 4 out of a 1,000 will likely fail. Using the proportions of a million, 4,000 will fail. To reach 20,000, that would require 5 million condoms. That's .004%\n\n \n First off, those are lab tests.\n \n If you got anything out of that article it should be that lab tests are not the real world.\n \n Simply filling a balloon with water isn't very realistic, is it?\n \n There are lots of other factors involved, including the experience of the partners, the nature and duration of the sexual encounter, and the types of possible diseases involved.\n \n That is why (this is what, the fourth time I've written this?) there are no solid numbers on how effective condoms are at stopping STDs.\n \n Now read this carefully.\n \n Condoms were not designed to stop STDs, they were designed for BIRTH CONTROL. That's why they used to be made out of animal parts.\n \n Stopping semen from leaking out is a lot easier than preventing blood- or skin-borne pathogens from spreading.\n \n You've made a lot of cheap jokes about my sexual experience, but I'm starting to wonder if you have any idea how it works.\n \n As you point out, teenagers have raging hormones. Gosh, they may also go at it with a reasonable amount of vigor.\n \n Lots of friction leads to skin abrasions and - wait for it - the potential for disease transmission.\n \n Sometimes these abrasions are outside the protected area of the condom. In that case, the condom is useless. It may as well be on somebody else because that impermeable layer of latex isn't between the disease and you.\n \n My 18-year-old nephew is able to grasp this concept, why can't you?\n \n \n \n \nAnd how would that go?\n\n \n By dumping the \"safe sex\" verbiage and acknowledging that condoms are not going to do the trick.\n \n True abstinence education would stress the benefits - mental, economic, and physical - by waiting to have sex.\n \n And yes, there is a moral component as well. We need to stress the fact that there is virtue in waiting and that the \"pimp culture\" is nothing to emulate and no way to live.\n \n Finally, we should recognize that sexual promiscuity is hugely detrimental to women. It drastically increases the threats to their health and inflicts often severe emotional damage.\n \n I once heard a feminist describe the Sexual Revolution thusly: \"Men got sex without responsibility. Women just got screwed.\"",

   "So basically, the ones that choose abstinence do better and the ones that don't, are much more likely to contract STDs.\n\n \n Wrong....again. Sure that could be very likely to be true, Unless kids know how to have sex safely. Ok, I agree that absinence is a 100% way of avoiding STDs. However its not the \"only\" way. Having your partner checked and knowing neither have a STD, and then using a condom on top of that is just as effective. So if we teach kids now to have sex safely, then people wouldnt be \"much more likley\" to contracting STD's.\n \n And stop arguing that condoms dont work. They are proven and are very effective. Did anyone say they work every time? No, noone said they are foolproof. So to you that seems to be a lie. I dont see how. Condoms and checkups are much more realistic then abstinence also. Stop saying its a \"lie\" to tell kids that condoms are effective, cause your own sources proved it. Effective doesnt mean foolproof either, so enough.",

   "Really missing the point, no offense to Duo intended, but I think he was pointing out that he couldn't go out and get that much sex if he tried. And anyway why isn't he allowed to use more than one condom?\n \n The point of the argument is not whether condoms are 100% effective at stopping STDs or pregancy. Its that telling kids that abstinence is the only way to be 100% sure and that any other means are useless or implying it is worse than teaching that abstinence maybe the only 100% sure way of avoiding pregnancy or STDs, however there are methods that you should know about if you are going to have sex.\n \n Those taught abstinence only methods still have sex, and seeing as they have been told that 'safe sex' is a load of rubbish they don't bother with any of it and therefore get more problems than the ones who were taught safe sex and go on to have as much sex as the others but do it safely.\n \n The most important statistic is how many of the people taught abstinence only methods actually follow it and stay abstinent. Its not very high, (hopefully it will get posted in a bit) and because of this - the class as a whole gets more STDs than a class that was taught safe sex. The one or two guys who stay virgins don't make up for the massive difference between their classmates chance of injection and the safe sex class.\n Honestly it wouldn't suprise me to find that they still wouldn't have had sex if taught safe sex half the time.",

   "This is pretty hilarious stuff.\n \n Basically you're saying that people are too stupid or incapable of self control to refrain from having sex, but will somehow have the restraint and willpower to use condoms, foams and other devices.\n \n Whatever.\n \n Abstinence works every time it is tried. The problem is that society - folks like you - have sent the message that expecting people to exercise self-control is simply impossible.\n \n You are telling young people that they cannot control their instincts so they shouldn't even try. \n \n So having made this pronouncement, you then argue that if we simply hand out condoms people will use them. \n \n No, they won't.\n \n Condoms are a hindrance and a distraction. If you're bent enough to get laid without regard to the consequences, you aren't going to bother with the rubber - and we have the soaring disease rates and out of wedlock births to prove it.\n \n What I find amusing is that it wasn't always so. When sex outside of marriage was taboo, you had low rates of STDs, low teen pregnancies and very low out of wedlock births.\n \n People respond to societal pressures. If enough people teach and enforce the beliefs that sex is best saved until marriage, you will see the trend lines reverse.\n \n But no, we can't reach that point because people like you are handing out condoms and foam as if they are magical talismans that ward off disease.\n \n Condoms are a major part of why STDs are spreading because they are ineffective against many diseases. It isn't a matter of breakage, the condom simply doesn't prevent friction and the exchange of fluids, germs and viruses.\n \n You will never find a technological solution to a behavioral problem.\n \n You can use a condom every time you have sex; coat yourself with spermacide and carry birth control pills in handy autodispensers and the fact remains that if you are sexually promiscuous, you WILL get a disease.\n \n The message should be utterly simple: Don't want to get sick? Don't have sex.\n \n Works every time it is tried.\n \n If that seems tough at times, sorry. That's life. That moment of wild abandon can cost a lot down the road.\n \n Once upon a time people understood that.\n\n \n \n \n take it from a child who has had the abstinence program to some degree, i didn't even know about the fuss of 'it is stupid and doesn't work' at the time. but guess what it didn't work. at 12 or 13 we simple picked all the floors out in the program you are saying now, that if you choose to have sex before marrige the program just discourages you from using a condom. \n yes some of the points about no sex before marrage made sense, but i can't see any one in my old class (at school) sticking to that. \n if you handed out free condoms however that would help, when argueing with friends over how rubbish the sex education system is that was one of the main things surgested that would work. us 14 year olds can figure that out, and you can't say we are wrong becasuewe are the people who it is targetted at.\n i've heard of sex education systems that looked into the pyschology of sex, when to do it and when not to, not taking advantage of someone ect. this school had alesson every week, i think that is what is needed. that and free condoms ect, would probably come in handy. \n that behavioral problem happens to be the most natural feeling in the world, and before religion was even thought of people where having sex, and they still will, married or not. i'd consentrate on them not having sex unprotected or through peer presure instead. your negative attitude towards condoms could stop someone using one, because from what your saying you might as well not; some how i don'tthink thats the way to go about it. do you?",

Sex with a condom is safer than sex without. Kids will have sex at young ages for the foreseeable future so you might as well make sure they get adequate protection.\n \n CvT has a point: if you really want to crack down on STDs and teenage pregnancies, then abstinence is definitely the best way to go about it. However most people don't seem to mind teenage sex: they may not endorse it, but they don't feel it's something you have to stop (it is their choice after all).\n \n \nAbortions are a result of unmarital sex.

However, my friends who had parents that they felt comfortable speaking about sex with were those who seemed to have waited the longest, or whose parents were aware of their sexual activities were able to provide them with the resources they needed (safe sex information, regular gynecological visits, etc). These kids also seemed much more capable of understanding the emotional implications of their sexual actions than others (like myself) were. \n \n Looking back, I wish that I had been able to discuss sex with my parents. I think that them at least showing an understanding of temptation and reasoning of why I should wait would have slowed me up quite a bit.

   "This is pretty hilarious stuff.\n \n Basically you're saying that people are too stupid or incapable of self control to refrain from having sex, but will somehow have the restraint and willpower to use condoms, foams and other devices.\n \n Whatever.\n \n Abstinence works every time it is tried. The problem is that society - folks like you - have sent the message that expecting people to exercise self-control is simply impossible.\n \n You are telling young people that they cannot control their instincts so they shouldn't even try. \n \n So having made this pronouncement, you then argue that if we simply hand out condoms people will use them. \n \n No, they won't.\n \n Condoms are a hindrance and a distraction. If you're bent enough to get laid without regard to the consequences, you aren't going to bother with the rubber - and we have the soaring disease rates and out of wedlock births to prove it.\n \n What I find amusing is that it wasn't always so. When sex outside of marriage was taboo, you had low rates of STDs, low teen pregnancies and very low out of wedlock births.\n \n People respond to societal pressures. If enough people teach and enforce the beliefs that sex is best saved until marriage, you will see the trend lines reverse.\n \n But no, we can't reach that point because people like you are handing out condoms and foam as if they are magical talismans that ward off disease.\n \n Condoms are a major part of why STDs are spreading because they are ineffective against many diseases. It isn't a matter of breakage, the condom simply doesn't prevent friction and the exchange of fluids, germs and viruses.\n \n You will never find a technological solution to a behavioral problem.\n \n You can use a condom every time you have sex; coat yourself with spermacide and carry birth control pills in handy autodispensers and the fact remains that if you are sexually promiscuous, you WILL get a disease.\n \n The message should be utterly simple: Don't want to get sick? Don't have sex.\n \n Works every time it is tried.\n \n If that seems tough at times, sorry. That's life. That moment of wild abandon can cost a lot down the road.\n \n Once upon a time people understood that.\n\n \n Finally, someone with some common sense!! Every word rings true. Thank you for some sanity in a world that has gone mad.",
