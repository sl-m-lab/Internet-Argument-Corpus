   "To Protestants: I dedicate this post in starting a discussion on The Nature of Mary, the Mother of God.\n \n Many of you like to down-play the uniqueness of Mary (the Theotokos: Mother of God). One of the ways of doing this is by suggesting that Jesus had other siblings; that Mary wasn't ever-Virgin.\n \n If I can deal first with the specialness of Mary...To down-play her specialness is\n a) un-biblical\n b) against traditional teaching\n c) illogical\n \n a) Bible:\n The Angel of the Lord said \"Blessed are you amongst women\"(Luke 1:42) and Mary said \"I will be blessed throughout the ages\" (Luke 1:48).\n \n b) Tradition: \n \"Therefore let those who deny that the Son is from the Father by nature and proper to His Essence, deny also that He took true human flesh of Mary Ever-Virgin; for in neither case had it been of profit to us men, whether the Word were not true and naturally Son of God, or the flesh not true which He assumed.\"\n Athanasius,Orations against the Arians,II:70(A.D. 362),in NPNF2,IV:386-387.\n \n \"[T]he Son of God...was born perfectly of the holy ever-virgin Mary by the Holy Spirit...\"\n Epiphanius,Well Anchored Man,120(A.D. 374),in JUR,II:70\n \n There are numerous other teachings on this matter. (ever-virgin means forever, before during and after the birth of Christ).\n \n c) Logic: \n NO OTHER PERSON ON EARTH has had the relationship she had with Christ. She carried him within her, she gave birth to Him, she nursed Him. That is unique.\n \n Now to the 'brothers' of Jesus...\n Many Protestants claim that Jesus had siblings...\n Again this is un-biblical.\n Almost all of the New Testament books were set down into Greek.\n \"The problem emerges in understanding the meaning of the word brother. In the original text of the Gospel, we find the Greek word adelphos, meaning \"brother,\" used. However, adelphos does not just mean blood brothers born of the same parents. Rather, adelphos was used to describe brothers not born of the same parents, like a half-brother or step-brother. The word also described other relationships like cousins, nephews, etc. For example, in Genesis 13:8 and 14:14-16, the word adelphos was used to describe the relationship between Abraham and Lot; however, these two men did not share a brother relationship, but one of uncle and nephew. Another instance is that of Laban, who was an adelphos to Jacob, not as a brother, but as an uncle. (In the New American translation, \"kinsman\" or \"relative\" will be used in these Old Testament cases; I do not know why this is not true in the English translation of the Gospel.) \"*\n http://www.catholicherald.com/saunders/02ws/ws021121.htm\n \n HOWEVER, We can use other parts of the Bible to prove that they weren't real brothers and sisters.\n Reading from John 19:26ff\n \"When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother \"Woman, behold your son!\"\n \"Then He said to the disciple, \"Behold your mother!\" And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.\"\n If Jesus had actual brothers, it would have been their responsibility to look after Mary. But Jesus had no siblings, and so he gave His mother to His most beloved disciple (John) to look after. Thus Holy Tradition is not un-biblical. Self-interpretation is!\n \n \n It is in fact like modern American slang where people say \"What's up bro?\" It suggests kinship, yes, but not siblings.\n \n The opposite arguments are all over the place. One recognises the use of the word adelphos, and then speculates on other words instead...\n \"Some have suggested that this word adelphos the Greek Word used for brothers can be translated as brethren, cousin, kinsman, countryman etc. as well as flesh and blood siblings and this is true. However, the text clearly shows that these Jewish leaders were ?amazed? at what Jesus was teaching and doing. Why? They knew Jesus all of His life. They saw Him grow up and there was nothing special about Him in their eyes. He had no special education or Rabbinic training or the like. How do we know that they knew Him so well? Their description of exactly whose child He was. The son of Joseph and Mary, and the brother of the men listed and the sisters. Why would one use kinsman to identify one with a certain mother and father, or the word cousin? And a Jew certainly would not include a woman as a kinsman or countryman or disciple etc. While the word for brother can have different meanings the word for sister is pretty clear. This was an identification of His family, that one that these men knew well enough to name. One that the hearers would recognize or at least be able to investigate afterwards. \"\n http://members.tripod.com/~BIBLE_ANSWER_MAN/index-17.html\n \n That is, that Jesus must have had literal brothers and sisters, because they Jews were 'amazed'. This is an odd argument.\n \n One writer went on to say \"Mary was human like us and therefore her act of obedience as a servant leader is more compelling and invitational for us as well. \"Let me be the servant of God, the handmaiden of God,\" she said; let life develop as it needs to develop though she did not know what that would eventually mean - just as you and I do not know at the time when we say yes to God's call for us to be God's servants as well.\"\n http://www.st-andrew-umc.com/sermons/2002/122202.htm\n The same writer speculates that Joseph wasn't a carpenter, but a worker of stone! You can really interpret what ever you want... carpenter means stonemason!\n \n \n Out of curiosity...\n \n I'd like to know what you think of the passage of the New Testament where Jesus says \"My God, My God, why have thou forsaken me?\"",

The interpretation could go either way.\n\n \n By itself, you are correct. However you were presented with more evidence, both Biblical and non-Biblical\n Biblical - \n usage of the word adelphus - meaning non-literal brother\n and\n Jesus giving Mary to the care of His mother.\n \n Plus tradition, which as I mentioned earlier, because not everything in the Bible is set down, continues with the oral teachings... which say that Mary is an ever-virgin.\n \n ?It is truly right to bless you, O Theotokos, ever blessed and most pure, and the Mother of our God. More honourable than the Cherubim, and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim, without defilement you gave birth to God the Word. True Theotokos we magnify you.? ? Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom\n (John Chrysostom d.407)\n \n \"Set a rampart about my mind, O my Christ, for I make bold to sing the praise of Thy pure Mother\" (Ikos of the Dormition). \"The Church teaches that Christ was truly born of Mary Ever-Virgin\" (St. Epiphanius, \"True Word Concerning the Faith\").\n (St. Ephiphanius d.403)\n \n \"It is essential for us to confess that the holy Ever-Virgin Mary is actually Theotokos (Birth-giver of God), so as not to fall into blasphemy. For those who deny that the Holy Virgin is actually Theotokos are no longer believers, but disciples of the Pharisees and Sadducees\" (St. Ephraim the Syrian, \"To John the Monk\").\n (St. Ephraim 306-373)\n \n I have purposely included the dates into which these people wrote. They wrote AT the time that the Bible was being compiled. Thus the teachings that lead to the Bible also lead to these conclusions re: Mary's ever-virgin status.\n \n If you reject these teachings then you are undermining the authority of those that compiled the Bible, therefore you are undermining the authority of the Bible.\n \n Holy Tradition can not be contradictory, it's like saying that you accept half the Church's teachings, or that the Church taught one thing, and at the same time taught something completely different.\n \n \nmontalban: I suggest you check with your clergy. I am fairly certain that there is no difference on this doctrine. Jesus was rejected by God. In this way no man would ever have to experience that unless he chose to. He was later accepted by God. That is the proof that the sacrifice was adequate once and for all. The resurrection! I believe the orthodox, catholic, and protestant agree on this doctrinal issue.\n\n \n Never. Jesus is God, therefore perfect. God would never reject God. To say so, quite frankly is ludicrous. To say that Jesus lost faith at this most crucial hour might be acceptable in your world where it doesn't matter what you do, so long as you're saved... in fact that reminds me... if faith alone was all that it took, then Jesus need never have died. He could have just got St. Peter to believe in Him by 'faith alone'. But Jesus had to do something, to commit Himself to a final 'act'... that is to sacrifice Himself for us.\n \n It is a common misconception of bible-only Christians. Did you not read the passage from Psalms. Jesus was basically saying \"You think you're just killing another heretic... well guess what! You're fulfilling prophecy as we speak\"\n \n \nI have done some significant research. My sources do not agree as to the interpretation of various scriptures. Matt 1:27 (or perhaps 25) and somewhere in Luke refer to Jesus being Mary's firstborn.\n \n\n \n There is no Matthew 1:27.\n \n Matt 1:25 says ?But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.?\n New International Version (NIV)\n \"and knew her not till she had brought forth a son: and he called his name JESUS.\"\n American Standard Version (ASV)\n \"But they did not sleep together before her baby was born. Then Joseph named him Jesus.\"\n Contemporary English Version (CEV)\n \n However I concede that\n The NKJV and KJV say\n and knew her not until she had brought forth her firstborn Son. And he\n called His name JESUS.\n All available at: http://bible.gospelcom.net/\n \n How therefore do you know which translation is correct - (again another failing of sola scriptura!) is you go to Tradition - what has the Church always taught on this matter.\n \n \nSome commentaries and dictionaries state that this is proof that Mary was not an Ever-Virgin. Since he was firstborn, it would follow that there were others. Other commentaries point out that the term firstborn was used in reference to The Law for inheritance purposes whether or not there were others.

I do not think it provable in either direction. [/QUOTE]\n \n Maximus has shown you what the term 'first-born' refers to\n \n However, it is provable. Tradition maintains that she was and is ever-Virgin. That is, it has always been taught that way.\n \n Thus the passage \"And the Lord said unto me: This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall pass through it; because the Lord God of Israel hath entered in by it, and it shall be shut.\" (Ezekiel 44:2) has always been taught to refer to the ?gates to Mary?s womb?\n \n \nAs a protestant, I do hold Mary in high esteem but no more than Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph (of the old testament or new), David, Solomon, etc. I have seen where the catholic position has put her on a par with Jesus himself. From some Catholics not all. Many pray to her. I do not agree with praying to saints as I prefer to pray to God Himself. \n\n \n Mary conceived in a most unusual way, she bore Christ, she was deemed to be blessed amongst women. These things point to her being special.\n \n I do understand your stance. It just happens to go against 2,000 years of teaching.\n \n \n I do pray to Mary. All Orthodox do. Catholics, we believe, have raised her too far? to co-redemptoress status.\n \n As I said earlier, no other person has carried the Lord within them. She is unique. Not even David did what she did.\n \n Mary, humbly, recognised this...\n \"My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. For He hath regarded the low estate of His handmaiden, for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.\" (Luke 1:47-48)\n \n Others recognised this...\n \"Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.\" (Luke 1:41, 42)\n \n Mary saw Her Son persecuted and suffering. Rejoicing in the day of the Resurrection, on the day of Pentecost. She was clothed with power from on high (Luke 24:49). The Holy Spirit Who descended upon Her taught (Her) all things (John 14:26), and instructed (Her) in all truth (John 16:13).\n \n ?If one does not acknowledge Mary as Theotokos, he is estranged from God.?\n ?

My comments indicate that the use of the word adelphos is indeterminate not determinant. There is disagreement on what the meaning is. It can mean actual brother or brother in a \"brotherly sense.\"\n That does not prove your point only makes it possible.\n\n \n There is not disagreement. I have told you Holy Tradition says what it means.\n \n \nI reject church tradition. It is irrelevant since to me since I consider the word of God to be the only authority. You cannot prove it to me otherwise. As for Catholics or orthodox telling me how to worship God well, I find the whole thing very pharasaical. Man makes laws on tradition and expects men to follow. Jesus preached against this very thing.\n\n \n Jesus said many things. If you just go by what the Bible says you could end up in a church that handles snakes, or a church that won't celebrate on a Sunday\n \n Tell me, if you're American; If you went to court, do you just rely on what is in the Constitution, or do you use law books and commentaries? Would you look at the writings of the people who put the constitution together to get an idea of what was in their minds?\n \n To reject Tradition is to reject the Bible. Basically you are like someone who at Christmas gets five presents, but throws all but one away. The same Church that gives you the Bible has given you vast bodies of commentaries, etc, and you're going to say \"I reject them all, but I'll accept this one book as the authority\"? That simply makes no sense. Worse still then rejecting the Christmas presents, you are also rejecting the person who gave you those presents.\n \n Why is the Bible by itself the supreme authority? You have made it so. Therefore it's authority depends on you! The Church that put the Bible together never said this shall be the ultimate book. You accept their book, but not the church that gave it to you.\n \n \nAs I said, I have looked at many commentaries and dictionaries, even read my \"New Testament Greek\" text to understand some of the nuances. There is nothing conclusive. Mary was special. No doubt. She was not and is not God and I will not put her there. She was human. There is no proof that she was \"ever-virgin\". You have evidence, yes, so do I. The evidence you have is only supposition as is mine. We will not know.\n\n \n As I said, I have presented evidence. This is a bit like arguing with evolutionaries over evidence. Crim rejects all evidence that is not scientific. You reject all evidence that is not Biblical. Both cases show a blinkered approach to searching for the truth because there simply is more evidence there. No wonder I can't prove this to you... as you will never be able to prove God to Crim.\n \n But then on another thread about proving the actual existence of Jesus, I demonstrated that you can go to www.earlychristianwritings.com to see all the books written. What you accepted as proof of Jesus existing, is now rejected as proof of Jesus' words!\n \n All the books there pre-date the Bible. (Some went into the Bible). Others have been accepted by the Church. You might want to read them one day.",

And even perhaps some theology. I am much more interested in unity as are you. John 17 is a great prayer. I do not attend a church with snakes. Bad theology does that not excluding Holy tradition. We consider Jesus to be the High Priest. We do not need a pope. Yes there are doctrinal disagreements amongst protestants. One could point to the catholic orthodox split as well. But, when it comes down to it The apostles creed is accepted by us all. I believe in one church. I believe in Jesus Christ the son, God the Father and the Holy Spirit (not an exact quote I know). And so do you. I pray that we learn to love one another (by this all men will know that you are my disciples.) I will pray over the weekend and then we can discuss this more. \n \n Let us discuss it carefully as two wishing to learn from each other rather than two trying to win over each other.\n \n God Bless.",

It is flawed as it is not based on scripture which protestants hold to be inspired by God and superintended by the Holy Spirit of God. \n\n \n Tradition put the Bible together. I believe you are looking at things the wrong way round. Scripture is based on tradition, tradition lead to scripture.\n \n What happened in the Church for 300 years? The Church lived tradition. Then the Bible was compiled. If you didn't have tradition then you'd have no Bible. If you didn't have tradition there'd be no Christian Church.\n \n \n2) I provided the information concerning the pharasaical approach of the catholic and orthodox churches. This is in scripture. But since you believe scripture is from man then you will not accept it. \n\n \n Of the so-called pharasaical approach... Jesus did frequently criticise the Pharisees. Hierarchies all have some bad habits. However, Jesus also empowered a select group to preach in His name. He had hundreds of followers, but He chose the 12 that He trusted the most... otherwise we'd have in the \"Bible the Gospel of Simon who heard Jesus one day when he was on his way home from work.\" But we don't because only a select group had been given commission - this was to ensure that the right message was passed on. St. Paul continually called people into line! Never did he say \"You've received the Word of God, you've got faith, now go out and worship anyway you want\".\n \n You believe Scripture is from man. If you really believed that it is from God, then why would you possibly reject all the other works produced by the same God-inspired Church? I mean, we've got books before the Bible, books after the Bible. You'd have to say that God didn't work with the church before or after, and even during the compilation of the Bible, except on the compilation of the Bible.\n \n It is plucking one book out of a number of legitimate books. It is taking it out of the Church (thus its context). The Word of God IS inspired by God. But you're only looking at some of God's words, not all of them. There are many books that show God's Word, and you ignore these.\n \n \n3) There is disagreement. You cannot say that just because \"Holy tradition\" says what it means that I must accept that. The commentaries that I read do not agree on it. Some say brother others say cousins and still others say they cannot determine. Hence, disagreement.\n\n \n Certainly there is disagreement. You disagree with Tradition. I agree with tradition, and therefore we are in disagreement. But tradition can not be easily dismissed. If you don't agree, then you're innovating when it comes to dogma. Christians always held that Mary is ever-Virgin. 1,500 years after the fact Luther comes along, ignoring 90% of Christian teachings, looks only at the Bible and makes a determination on that.\n \n You don't 'have' to agree. But you might want to be wary about disagreeing with the Church Jesus founded. Jesus entrusted His teachings to the Apostles. 300 years later, the same Church decided to put these together into the Bible. For 300 years they carried Jesus faith through tradition.\n \n \n4) I do not accept the apocryphal books as scripture. Where they contradict scripture I toss them. Only scripture is inspired. I have read them, don't assume I haven't. Not all of course but many. You are right, you cannot prove it to me. Predating does not automatically mean veracity.\n\n \n That's not the right term for all the books that aren't in the Bible - apocryphal. Such a term is used for books that imitate Biblical works. Such a term does not, I believe relate to Epistles such as that of St.Ignatius, or St.Clement of Rome. These then do not contradict the Bible. They compliment the Bible. They discuss things that the Bible leaves obscure, or they elaborate on things mentioned in the Bible. This is legitimate, because it is done by the same people who compiled the Bible.\n \n The same church that picked out the books to the Bible also said that many of the books that they didn't put into the Bible are inspired. The Didache was almost included in the Bible, and Revelations was almost excluded. By not including the Didache there are two things at work...\n One is you must accept the referees decision - because you accept the Bible.\n Two is the referee although not including the Didache, stated that it is an inspired work... therefore it is still a legitimate reference. This is akin to someone having 100 books, and putting 29 in one volume as a companion, but saying that all the books were legitimate works. You come along and just pick up the compilation.\n \n If an artist produces many pieces of work; paintings, sculptures etc., then what person in the world could take only one painting, claim only this is inspired, and if other works from the same artist deal with different subjects dismiss them because they have no 'relationship' to what's in the picture.\n \n If you can actually show me how the work of Ilias the Presbyter, or Thophanis the Monk, or Tertullian contradict the Bible then that would be a start.",

   "I mentioned on an earlier post how Martin Luther changed the meanings of some Biblical passages to suit his own slant on the faith alone issue.\n \n Here is some more in light of the subject of tradition\n \n \"In the minds of many Western Protestants, tradition is assumed to be a bad thing - to such an extent that when translating the Greek word \"paradosis\" into English, it is translated by \"tradition\" when a bad meaning is intended, and by some other word when a good meaning is intended. And it is very hard for Orthodox Christians to see this as anything other than wilful distortion of the meaning of Holy Scripture! \n Tradition (Greek \"paradosis\", Latin \"traditio\") means to hand something over, to deliver it, to pass something on. Whether it is good or bad depends on what is handed over, and why, and to whom. Christians who handed over the scriptures and other treasures of the Church to the police in times of persecution were called \"traditores\", and it was not a good thing - it was giving what is holy to dogs, casting pearls before swine. And that meaning has come into English as \"traitor\", one who hands over, or delivers, his country to the enemy. And Judas delivered Christ to his enemies, who delivered him to Pilate, who delivered him to be crucified (John 18:2, cf Jn 19:11,16). \n So not all \"tradition\" is good, but when Orthodox Christians speak of \"Holy Tradition\" they mean the handing on of the good news of the kingdom to those who are willing to receive it. Evangelism is thus tradition, because it is passing on the good news. The Holy Tradition is what is believed always, everywhere and by all. It is the apostles' teaching that was \"continued\" in the Christian community from the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:42).\"\n http://www.orthodoxy.faithweb.com/tradscri.htm",

Allow me to clarify mine. I do not have a problem with churches having traditions. Where one puts the pulpit etc. However, (And I will only speak from what I think I know) tradition in the catholic and orthodox church is placed on the same par as scripture. At one time the catholic church sold years off of time in purgatory for Gold to \"redecorate\". (About the time of Luther I believe) That would be an example of the church setting itself above scripture. As far as \"venerating\" Mary, I am uncertain as to your definition of \"Venerate\". I personally and most people in my church that I know would say Mary holds a special place. They do not believe that scripture specifically supports her being a virgin throughout her life. As stated before the evidence (other than orhtodox or catholic church tradition) is ambiguous. \n \n My church also does not pray to the \"saints\". I do not know about orthodox, but catholics do. I do not see this supported in scripture either. \n \n Traditions are fine as long as the do not go against scripture or are not really issues of right and wrong. They are not the same as the word of God. Yes, someone must interpret, but then there is the Holy Spirit for that. Someone must lead. Our church is an elder lead church. They beleive this is biblical as opposed to the single person head of the church model. Jesus called a number to be \"elders' who then appointed deacons to assist with the work of the chruch. We are nondenominational. We believe there is biblical support for a local church springing from a congregation of believers. There is appears to biblical antithesis to a highly organized rigid denominational structure (protestant and otherwise), the pharasees.",

   "Maximus: I do blieve that there is one church a catholic (universal) church. I do not believe that the current Roman catholic organization is that church. I do not believe that jesus founded it. Jesus did not refer to Peter when he said \"upon this rock I will establish my church.\" His reference was to the faith that Peter exhibited. It is a play on words with Peter's name. \n \n I am uncertain of the definition of an apostolic church but do think that we are. We are also a bible church. So, depending on that definition, I will withhold a definite answer. I do test the scriptures. I know that I am indwelt by the Holy spirit of God. Scripture is clear on that point. So I (Gal 2:20). Then rely on his grace for errors (romans 8:1) and rely on the spirit for correction. It requires that I be in contact with God (pray without ceasing). I do not see tradition as the same as sxcripture and will never be convinced as such. I am aware of your position and have listened carefully. I have many friends who are catholic. One of them calls me his \"misguided brother\". It is a good relationship. \n \n\n \n Epaphras,\n Yes, it was a play on words. A very definitive play on words.

Consider this: \n \n \"Who is the rock?\n \n Now take a closer look at the key verse: \"You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church\" (Matt. 16:18). Disputes about this passage have always been related to the meaning of the term \"rock.\" To whom, or to what, does it refer? Since Simon's new name of Peter itself means rock, the sentence could be rewritten as: \"You are Rock and upon this rock I will build my Church.\" The play on words seems obvious, but commentators wishing to avoid what follows from this-namely the establishment of the papacy-have suggested that the word rock could not refer to Peter but must refer to his profession of faith or to Christ. \n \n From the grammatical point of view, the phrase \"this rock\" must relate back to the closest noun. Peter's profession of faith (\"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God\") is two verses earlier, while his name, a proper noun, is in the immediately preceding clause. \n \n As an analogy, consider this artificial sentence: \"I have a car and a truck, and it is blue.\" Which is blue? The truck, because that is the noun closest to the pronoun \"it.\" This is all the more clear if the reference to the car is two sentences earlier, as the reference to Peter's profession is two sentences earlier than the term rock. \n \n Another alternative\n \n The previous argument also settles the question of whether the word refers to Christ himself, since he is mentioned within the profession of faith. The fact that he is elsewhere, by a different metaphor, called the cornerstone (Eph. 2:20, 1 Pet. 2:4-8) does not disprove that here Peter is the foundation. Christ is naturally the principal and, since he will be returning to heaven, the invisible foundation of the Church that he will establish; but Peter is named by him as the secondary and, because he and his successors will remain on earth, the visible foundation.

What is 'it' in verse 17 Peters confession. What is the rock? Peters confession. Notice also in the Greek if you have one. Petros vs. petra same root yes, but not the same meaning. Jesus clearly doesn't intend Petros to be the foundation. Rather petra the statement made by Peter.\n\n \n On petros and petra...\n \n In Greek, \"Petros\" is used to refer to the name of Peter while \"petra\" is used to refer to the rock. The claim is that \"petros\" refers to a small stone, while \"petra\" refers to a massive rock. Therefore, Christ is referring to Peter as a small stone and to the declaration of faith or Himself as the large stone. There are several problems with this argument. The major problem is the fact that the Greek does not matter. Jesus did not speak in Greek; he spoke in Aramaic. Matthew's Gospel was originally written in Aramaic. In Aramaic the word for rock is \"kepha.\" Remember that Peter is referred to as Cephas and Kephas in scripture also.\n \n The use of \"petros\" and \"petra\" came about with the translation from Aramaic to Greek. The Greek word for rock, \"petra,\" is feminine in gender. Although it could be applied to the reference to a stone rock, it could not be applied to Peter as a name because he was obviously a male. The substitution of the masculine \"petros\" was necessary. That is why it appears to many whom are ignorant of the subtleties of Greek (myself included) that Jesus is saying, \"You are a little rock (petros) but upon this big rock (petra) I build my Church.\" Another refutation of this meaning is the fact that petros and petra were synonyms in first century Greek. The distinction between the two words was gone by the first century. If the author wanted to make a distinction he would have used the Greek word lithos.\n \n So for a closer idea of what Christ said, one must substitute the Aramaic, \"You are kepha  and upon this kepha I build my Church.\" The true play on words Jesus intended can be seen using the Aramaic. The English rendering of this is closer to the original than the Greek because English nouns do not express gender. It could just as well be written, \"You are Rock and upon this rock I will build my Church.\" The name change, in itself, is significant. The change of name was a change of role or vocation as in the name changes pronounced by God upon Abram (Abraham) to become the father of the faith and Jacob ( Israel) to become the progenitor of the tribes of Israel named after his sons. (If Jesus would have said, \"You are Simon  and on the rock of your profession I build my Church\" then I could see your idea on Peter's profession. However, with the name change occurring at that very moment along with the grammar problems, this theory does not hold up). (Most of this explanation was synthesized from Karl Keating's book Catholicism and Fundamentalism  and Patrick Madrid's book Pope Fiction).\n \n There are also the problems of geography, the establishment of Peter as the leader of the church in numerous other scripture verses, and the significance of the \"keys of the kingdom\" as they relate to the Old Testament. I could expound but this would be a lengthy post. I have something I could send you on e-mail that gives a complete scriptural explanation on the truth of Peter's Primacy. If you are interested then send me a private message and I will e-mail it.",

   "That was its intent. The idea was a backwards argument.\n \n \n \n If the Bible is 'ambiguous' about Mary, then strictly speaking it is not anti-Biblical to teach about her the way Orthodoxy does.

Where is the 'biblical support' for a local church springing from a congregation?

Perhaps I have said that but I don't think that is what I mean. I do not venerate Mary to the same degree. Mary is to be honored. But I do not believe she remained a virgin. The text on that IS ambiguous. I would like to hear STRO and Parcum parse this concept as well.\n \n What do you think of the concept of the \"ever-virgin\" Mary?",

   "First let me apologize for any delay in answering the questions asked of me. I forgot that I have not explained to this group my work schedule forbids adequate time to access a computer regularly.\n Maximums: You asked, \"What has told me that tradition is not inspired by God\" I believe we have adequacy answered that scripture alone is 'God breathed'. Double check specifically the verses in Timothy. You also asked, \"Where does the Bible say that we are saved by faith alone?\" That question is a loaded one. For we are not saved by faith alone. We are saved by grace alone through faith. Included are verses to back up the importance of this faith.\n Romans 5:1-2\n 1 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:\n 2 By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.\n \n Romans 10:8-10, 16-17\n 8 But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;\n 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\n 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.\n 16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?\n 17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.\n \n Galatians 2:16\n 16 Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.\n \n Ephesians 2:8-9\n 8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:\n 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.\n \n 1 Peter 1:4-5\n 4 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,\n 5 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.\n \n Note also many of these verses again state that this saving faith cannot be lost.\n \n Lastly, Maximums you asked about tradition. The only tradition I could find in scripture is actually the ordinance of the Lord's supper, and Baptism. In fact the verse list on many of these threads in support of tradition are actually in support of these two ordinances. It is important to remember that tradition is the tool used by the religious leaders to crucify Jesus. When God gave his commands He was very specific, but the Pharisees added to the scripture with there tradition. This tradition caused the rejection of the messiah long before His arrival. Remember the birth of Jesus: who came to show honor to Christ. The magi. These wise men examined scripture apart from the tradition, and there motivation was to go and see this King. The tradition of the religious today clouds the minds of those who seek Jesus today. Please don't find Jesus saying to you as He did to the Pharisee \"Woe\"\n \n In a different post, Max you wanted to inform me that the Baptist did not break off of the Catholic Church. I know this and if you read my post you would see that I was referring to the protestant churches. The conflicts which led the reformation included Justification by grace through faith. Luther did not correct the Bible rather he corrected the false teaching of the Church of that time. The Word of God cannot and will not change. \n \n In your most recent post Max, you accused me of teaching Petros = little rock and petra = big rock. This was not the point I was making at all. Rather My point which I will state again is Petros is the new name of Peter. Petra is the rock which is Peters confession. Had the Church been built on Peter Himself the statement would read. You are Petros and on Petros I will build my church. Rather God through inspiration uses a different term - petra, meaning that Peter himself is not the foundation of the church but rather his confession. If God meant Peter the proper noun would have been used. \n Matthew however did not write in Aramaic. Aramaic is a spoken language, it is the language spoke during the life of Christ and probably even during this interlude, however through Inspiration we know what is meant by God in this conversation. In fact in Peter's gospel he tells us that inspiration is better than eye witness. Therefore no translation from Aramaic to Greek was necessary. Also lithos would never have been use in this sentence because this word refers to something made of a rock, rather than the rock itself.",

   "Lappster,\n \n From James Akin's website, www.jamesakin.com,\n \n \"Who Compiled the Old Testament?\n \n The Church does not deny that there are ancient writings which are \"apocryphal.\" During the early Christian era, there were scores of manuscripts which purported to be Holy Scripture but were not. Many have survived to the present day, like the Apocalypse of Peter and the Gospel of Thomas, which all Christian churches regard as spurious writings that don't belong in Scripture.\n During the first century, the Jews disagreed as to what constituted the canon of Scripture. In fact, there were a large number of different canons in use, including the growing canon used by Christians. In order to combat the spreading Christian cult, rabbis met at the city of Jamnia or Javneh in A.D. 90 to determine which books were truly the Word of God. They pronounced many books, including the Gospels, to be unfit as scriptures. This canon also excluded seven books (Baruch, Sirach, 1 and 2 Maccabees, Tobit, Judith, and the Wisdom of Solomon, plus portions of Esther and Daniel) that Christians considered part of the Old Testament.\n The group of Jews which met at Javneh became the dominant group for later Jewish history, and today most Jews accept the canon of Javneh. However, some Jews, such as those from Ethiopia, follow a different canon which is identical to the Catholic Old Testament and includes the seven deuterocanonical books (cf. Encyclopedia Judaica, vol. 6, p. 1147).\n Needless to say, the Church disregarded the results of Javneh. First, a Jewish council after the time of Christ is not binding on the followers of Christ. Second, Javneh rejected precisely those documents which are foundational for the Christian Church -- the Gospels and the other documents of the New Testament. Third, by rejecting the deuterocanonicals, Javneh rejected books which had been used by Jesus and the apostles and which were in the edition of the Bible that the apostles used in everyday life -- the Septuagint.\n \n The Apostles & the Deuteros\n The Christian acceptance of the deuterocanonical books was logical because the deuterocanonicals were also included in the Septuagint, the Greek edition of the Old Testament which the apostles used to evangelize the world. Two thirds of the Old Testament quotations in the New are from the Septuagint. Yet the apostles nowhere told their converts to avoid seven books of it. Like the Jews all over the world who used the Septuagint, the early Christians accepted the books they found in it. They knew that the apostles would not mislead them and endanger their souls by putting false scriptures in their hands -- especially without warning them against them.\n But the apostles did not merely place the deuterocanonicals in the hands of their converts as part of the Septuagint. They regularly referred to the deuterocanonicals in their writings. For example, Hebrews 11 encourages us to emulate the heroes of the Old Testament and in the Old Testament \"Women received their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, that they might rise again to a better life\" (Heb. 11:35).\n There are a couple of examples of women receiving back their dead by resurrection in the Protestant Old Testament. You can find Elijah raising the son of the widow of Zarepheth in 1 Kings 17, and you can find his successor Elisha raising the son of the Shunammite woman in 2 Kings 4, but one thing you can never find -- anywhere in the Protestant Old Testament, from front to back, from Genesis to Malachi -- is someone being tortured and refusing to accept release for the sake of a better resurrection. If you want to find that, you have to look in the Catholic Old Testament -- in the deuterocanonical books Martin Luther cut out of his Bible.\n Hebrews 11:35 is an indisputable reference to 2 Maccabees 7, but many are not so clear as there may be only a single phrase that echoes one in a deuterocanonical book (and this may not be obvious in the translation, but only the original languages).  \n \n The story is found in 2 Maccabees 7, where we read that during the Maccabean persecution, \"It happened also that seven brothers and their mother were arrested and were being compelled by the king, under torture with whips and cords, to partake of unlawful swine's flesh. . . . but the brothers and their mother encouraged one another to die nobly, saying, 'The Lord God is watching over us and in truth has compassion on us . . . ' After the first brother had died . . . they brought forward the second for their sport. . . . he in turn underwent tortures as the first brother had done. And when he was at his last breath, he said, 'You accursed wretch, you dismiss us from this present life, but the King of the universe will raise us up to an everlasting renewal of life'\" (2 Macc. 7:1, 5-9).\n One by one the sons die, proclaiming that they will be vindicated in the resurrection. \"The mother was especially admirable and worthy of honorable memory. Though she saw her seven sons perish within a single day, she bore it with good courage because of her hope in the Lord. She encouraged each of them . . . [saying], 'I do not know how you came into being in my womb. It was not I who gave you life and breath, nor I who set in order the elements within each of you. Therefore the Creator of the world, who shaped the beginning of man and devised the origin of all things, will in his mercy give life and breath back to you again, since you now forget yourselves for the sake of his laws,'\" telling the last one, \"Do not fear this butcher, but prove worthy of your brothers. Accept death, so that in God's mercy I may get you back again with your brothers\" (2 Macc. 7:20-23, 29).\n This is but one example of the New Testaments' references to the deuterocanonicals. The early Christians were thus fully justified in recognizing these books as Scripture, for the apostles not only set them in their hands as part of the Bible they used to evangelize the world, but also referred to them in the New Testament itself, citing the things they record as examples to be emulated.\" \n \n See also the literary parallels between Wisdom and Paul's Letter to the Romans (Romans 1: 20-29 with Wisdom 13:5,8; 14:24, 27 and Romans 9:20-23 with Wisdom 12:12,20; 15:7) as well as Corinthians (compare 2 Corinthians 5:1-4 with Wisdom 9:15) The Letter of James contains allusions to Proverbs and Sirach (James 1:19 with Sirach 5:11; James 1:13 with Sirach15:11-12) (Unabridged Christianity by Father Mario P. Romero)",

Look at John 21:25, not everything Jesus said or did was in scripture. In fact, nowhere did Jesus command anyone to write down scripture or compile a Bible. He told everyone to go out and preach the word and make disciples. \n \n \nIt is important to remember that tradition is the tool used by the religious leaders to crucify Jesus. When God gave his commands He was very specific, but the Pharisees added to the scripture with there tradition.

Someone else must have posted that to you.\n \n \nLuther did not correct the Bible rather he corrected the false teaching of the Church of that time. \n \n \n I disagree and 1500 years of sound Christianity does also. Actually, Luther twisted the scriptures by deleting 7 books from the Old Testament (see other post on apocrypha). 7 books that contained support for Catholic doctrines he did not support. 7 books that were accepted for 1500 years prior to his rebellion. Further twisting came in Luther's German translation of the Bible. I think the twisting remains in the Lutheran Bible to this day. He added the word \"alone\" to Romans 3:28. Then he called the epistle of James an \"epistle of straw.\" He even wanted to throw it out of the Bible. How can someone say that about the Bible if he believes it to be the word of God? \n \n \nThe Word of God cannot and will not change. \n \n \n Amen brother.\n \n \nIn your most recent post Max, you accused me of teaching Petros = little rock and petra = big rock. This was not the point I was making at all. Rather My point which I will state again is Petros is the new name of Peter. Petra is the rock which is Peters confession.

I don't really disagree totally that it can't be Peter's confession but you cannot separate Peter's confession from Peter himself.\n \n \nMatthew however did not write in Aramaic. Aramaic is a spoken language, it is the language spoke during the life of Christ and probably even during this interlude, however through Inspiration we know what is meant by God in this conversation.\n \n \n Actually, I believe there are fragments of Matthew's gospel in Aramaic. I will have to research.\n \n However, if there are not, my point still stands and I made it later in that post. You are right, Jesus did not speak Greek, he spoke Aramaic. I stated that. So what options did Jesus have? \"You are kepha and upon this kepha I build my church.\" That's what he said. Now how has \"inspiration\" led you to something different than that?\n \n Peace.",

Paul met Him on the road to Dimascus and is a apostle.\n Acts 14:14\n But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting: \n Romans 1:1\n Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God- \n Romans 1:5\n Through him and for his name's sake, we received grace and apostleship to call people from among all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith. \n Romans 11:13\n I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry \n 1 Corinthians 1:1\n Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes, \n 1 Corinthians 9:1\n Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not the result of my work in the Lord? \n 2 Corinthians 1:1\n Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the church of God in Corinth, together with all the saints throughout Achaia: \n Galatians 1:1\n Paul, an apostle-sent not from men nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead- \n Ephesians 1:1\n Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints in Ephesus,[ 1:1 Some early manuscripts do not have in Ephesus.] the faithful[ 1:1 Or believers who are] in Christ Jesus: \n Colossians 1:1\n Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, \n 1 Timothy 1:1\n Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope, \n 2 Timothy 1:1\n Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus, \n 2 Timothy 1:11\n And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher. \n Titus 1:1\n Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of God's elect and the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness- \n \n As you can see Paul was an apostle. And (1 Corinthians 9:1\n Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not the result of my work in the Lord?) shows why he and others were called apostles. There are no verses that are as blatant in Luks defence. However we know that he was in the room when Jesus appeared to them, he was at the accention, and 'God breathed' The gospel of Luke, and Acts which he authored.\n All authority is given to Jesus, who is the word of God. Through Jesus men were inspired to write the books of the Bible, and through Jesus men compiled these books. At no time was the authority anyone but Jesus'. The Church did not recive God's blessing to authoritate scripture. Rather they were compling that which was already given athority. In fact the scripture is given authority over the Church. If any man or organization teachs any gospel other than the one contained in Scripture they are damned by scripture. Therefore Why would catholics damn themselves by saying they are the athority for that which dams them.",

   "I don't know what the ORthodox believe, but I do know that the EAstern Catholic Churches have a strong tradition that Joseph was a widow, and had children that Mary raised. \n \n \n I would like to hear STRO and Parcum parse this concept as well.\n\n \n It has been a tradition for thousands of years that Mary remained a virgin after she bore Christ. We get this solely from tradition, it's not biblical, nor does the bible say that Mary wasn't a virgin. Even the early Protestant fathers knew Mary was a virgin- Luther, Calvin, Zwingli, they all agreed:\n \n  Christ, our Savior, was the real and natural fruit of Mary's virginal womb . . . This was without the cooperation of a man, and she remained a virgin after that.  -Martin Luther (Sermons on John, 1539) \n \n  Christ . . . was the only Son of Mary, and the Virgin Mary bore no children besides Him . . . I am inclined to agree with those who declare that 'brothers' really mean 'cousins' here, for Holy Writ and the Jews always call cousins brothers. -Martin Luther (Sermons on John, 1539)\n \n  A new lie about me is being circulated. I am supposed to have preached and written that Mary, the mother of God, was not a virgin either before or after the birth of Christ . . . - Martin Luther (Sermons on John, 1539)\n \n Calvin says that the argument about \"brothers\" is irrelivent:\n \n  [On Matt 1:25:] The inference he [Helvidius] drew from it was, that Mary remained a virgin no longer than till her first birth, and that afterwards she had other children by her husband . . . No just and well-grounded inference can be drawn from these words . . . as to what took place after the birth of Christ. He is called 'first-born'; but it is for the sole purpose of informing us that he was born of a virgin . . . What took place afterwards the historian does not inform us . . . No man will obstinately keep up the argument, except from an extreme fondness for disputation. -John Calvin (Harmony of Matthew, Mark & Luke)\n \n  I have never thought, still less taught, or declared publicly, anything concerning the subject of the ever Virgin Mary, Mother of our salvation, which could be considered dishonourable, impious, unworthy or evil . . . I believe with all my heart according to the word of holy gospel that this pure virgin bore for us the Son of God and that she remained, in the birth and after it, a pure and unsullied virgin, for eternity. Hulriech Zwingli (Mary, ever virgin, mother of God, 1524)\n \n Even John WESLEY believed Mary was a virgin!\n \n  I believe... he [Jesus Christ] was born of the blessed Virgin, who, as well after as she \n brought him forth, continued a pure and unspotted virgin.- John Wesley (Letter to a Roman Catholic, ??)\n \n Protevangelicum of James (120 AD): \n \n  \"And when she was twelve years old there was held a council of priests, saying, 'Behold, Mary has reached the age of twelve years in the temple of the Lord. What then shall we do with her, lest perchance she defile the sanctuary of the Lord?' And they said to the high priest, 'You stand by the altar of the Lord; go in and pray concerning her, and whatever the Lord shall manifest to you, that also will we do.' . . . [A]nd he prayed concerning her, and behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him saying, 'Zechariah! Zechariah! Go out and assemble the widowers of the people and let them bring each his rod, and to whomsoever the Lord shall show a sign, his wife shall she be. . . . And Joseph [was chosen]. . . . And the priest said to Joseph, 'You have been chosen by lot to take into your keeping the Virgin of the Lord.' But Joseph refused, saying, 'I have children, and I am an old man, and she is a young girl'\"",

I believe the bible is inspired, I also think the catholic and orthodox churches do as well.\n \n The issue of Holy Tradition being superior to scripture I would highly doubt. Equal to, I don't think so. There is a certain logic in what Montalban says. However, God says \"My ways are not your ways, My thoughts are not your thoughts.\" He also says not to add anything to scripture. \n \n Be careful of the \"damning\" talk lest you walk into judgement. Regardless of doctrinal differences they are our brothers. as Jesus prayed in John 17, let us seek to understand (in this case through debate) so that we may be more unified.\n \n I am curious to hear from others as well on this issue of the ever-virgin Mary.

Therefore Why would catholics damn themselves by saying they are the athority for that which dams them.\n\n \n \n Lappster,\n I agree with you that Paul was an apostle but Paul knew that the Church held authority. The Church does have God's blessing to authorize scripture--the only entity that has this power because the Church is also one and the same with the men who wrote the inspired scripture. Jesus has all authority but it is apparent in scripture that he did, in fact, pass his authority on to the Church...Luke 10:16, Matthew 28:18-20, Matthew 18: 17, Matthew 18:18, Matthew 16:18. The apostles then passed their authority on as can be seen in Acts at the Council of Jerusalem and in many writings of scripture and the Church Fathers. \n \n The scripture you quote actually says if anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to that which you received in the translation that I have. It does not mention any containment or limitation in scripture as a written form. Paul's writings show that he believed in the full revelation of Christ that was embodied in the spoken word, the written word, and the living practices of the Church (\"What you have learned and received and heard  and seen in me, do...\" Philippians 4:9). \n \n In addition, Paul was not afraid of the authority of the Church. Read what Paul wrote:\n \n 2 Thessalonians 3:4 \"And we have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will do the things which we command.\n \n 2 Thessalonians 3:6  \"Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ...\n \n Philemon 8, \"Though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required, yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you...\"\n \n Acts 15:24-25 is another example of the need for the Church to appoint those who have authority.\n \n Catholics do not condemn themselves by saying they are the authority for that which damns them. The Church is the authority because it has been appointed the authority by Christ. The Church has no choice but to obey the word of God and the word of God definitely does not condemn the Church.",

   "Here's a good reference to the Eastern Catholic Churches:\n \n \n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n \n The Various Rites and Churches of the Catholic Church\n \n \n \n Western Rites and Churches\n Immediately subject to the Supreme Pontiff as Patriarch of the West\n \n \n ROMAN (also called Latin)\n The Church of Rome is the Primatial See of the world and the Patriarchal See of Western Christianity. Founded by St. Peter in 42 AD it was consecrated by the blood of Sts. Peter and Paul during the persecution of Nero (63-67 AD). It has maintained a continual existence since then and is the source of a family of Rites in the West. Considerable scholarship (such as that of Fr. Louis Boyer in Eucharist) suggests the close affinity of the Roman Rite proper with the Jewish prayers of the synagogue, which also accompanied the Temple sacrifices. While the origin of the current Rite, even in the reform of Vatican II, can be traced directly only to the 4th century, these connections point to an ancient apostolic tradition brought to that city that was decidedly Jewish in origin.\n \n After the Council of Trent it was necessary to consolidate liturgical doctrine and practice in the face of the Reformation. Thus, Pope St. Pius V imposed the Rite of Rome on the Latin Church (that subject to him in his capacity as Patriarch of the West), allowing only smaller Western Rites with hundreds of years of history to remain. Many younger Rites of particular dioceses or regions ceased to exist. \n \u0095 Roman - The overwhelming majority of Latin Catholics and of Catholics in general. Patriarch of this and the other Roman Rites is the Bishop of Rome.\n \u0095 Mozarabic - The Rite of the Iberian peninsula (Spain and Portugal) known from at least the 6th century, but probably with roots to the original evangelization. Beginning in the 11th century it was generally replaced by the Roman Rite, although it has remained the Rite of the cathedral of the Archdiocese of Toledo, Spain, and six parishes which sought permission to adhere to it. Its celebration today is generally semi-private.\n \u0095 Ambrosian - The Rite of the Archdiocese of Milan, Italy, thought to be of early origin and probably consolidated, but not originated, by St. Ambrose. Pope Paul VI was from this Roman Rite. It continues to be celebrated in Milan, though not by all parishes.\n \u0095 Bragan - Rite of the Archdiocese of Braga, the Primatial See of Portugal, it derives from the 12th century or earlier. It continues to be of occasional use.\n \u0095 Dominican - Rite of the Order of Friars Preacher (OP), founded by St. Dominic in 1215.\n \u0095 Carmelite - Rite of the Order of Carmel, whose modern foundation was by St. Berthold c.1154.\n \u0095 Carthusian - Rite of the Carthusian Order founded by St. Bruno in 1084.\n \n \n \n Eastern Rites and Churches \n They have their own hierarchy distinct from the Latin Rite, system of governance (synods) and general law, the Code of Canons for the Eastern Churches. The Supreme Pontiff exercises his authority over them through the Congregation for the Eastern Churches. \n \n ANTIOCHIAN\n The Church of Antioch in Syria (on the Mediterranean coast) is considered an apostolic see by virtue of having been founded by St. Peter. It was one of the ancient centers of the Church, as the New Testament attests, and is the source of a family of similar Rites using the ancient Syriac language (the Semitic dialect used in Jesus' time and better known as Aramaic). Its Liturgy is attributed to St. James and the Church of Jerusalem.\n \n 1. WEST SYRIAN \n \u0095 Maronite - Never separated from Rome. Maronite Patriarch of Antioch. The liturgical language is Aramaic. The 3 million Maronites are found in Lebanon (origin), Cyprus, Egypt, Syria, Israel, Canada, US, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Australia.\n \u0095 Syriac - Syrian Catholics who returned to Rome in 1781 from the monophysite heresy. Syriac Patriarch of Antioch. The 110,000 Syrian Catholics are found in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt, Canada and the US.\n \u0095 Malankarese - Catholics from the South of India evangelized by St. Thomas, uses the West Syriac liturgy. Reunited with Rome in 1930. Liturgical languages today are West Syriac and Malayalam. The 350,000 Malankarese Catholics are found in India and North America.\n \n 2. EAST SYRIAN\n \u0095 Chaldean - Babylonian Catholics returned to Rome in 1692 from the Nestorian heresy. Patriarch of Babylon of the Chaldeans. Liturgical languages are Syriac and Arabic. The 310,000 Chaldean Catholics are found in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Turkey and the US).\n \u0095 Syro-Malabarese - Catholics from Southern India using the East Syriac liturgy. Returned to Rome in the 16th century from the Nestorian heresy. Liturgical languages are Syriac and Malayalam. Over 3 million Syro-Malabarese Catholics can be found in the state of Kerela, in SW India.\n \n \n \n BYZANTINE\n The Church of Constantinople became the political and religious center of the eastern Roman Empire after the Emperor Constantine built a new capital there (324-330) on the site of the ancient town of Byzantium. Constantinople developed its own liturgical rite from the Liturgy of St. James, in one form as modified by St. Basil, and in a more commonly used form, as modified by St. John Chrysostom. After 1054, except for brief periods of reunion, most Byzantine Christians have not been in communion with Rome. They make up the Orthodox Churches of the East, whose titular head is the Patriarch of Constantinople. The Orthodox Churches are mostly auto-cephalous, meaning self-headed, united to each other by communion with Constantinople, which exercises no real authority over them. They are typically divided into Churches along nation lines. Those that have returned to communion with the Holy See are represented among the Eastern Churches and Rites of the Catholic Church.\n \n 1. ARMENIAN\n Considered either its own Rite or an older version of the Byzantine. Its exact form is not used by any other Byzantine Rite. It is composed of Catholics from the first people to convert as a nation, the Armenians (N.E. of Turkey), and who returned to Rome at the time of the Crusades. Patriarch of Cilicia of the Armenians. The liturgical language is classical Armenian. It's 350,000 Armenian Catholics are found in Armenia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, Greece, Ukraine, France, Romania, United States and Argentina. Most Armenians are Orthodox, not in union with Rome.\n \n 2. BYZANTINE\n \u0095 Albanian - Albanian Christians, numbering only 1400 today, who resumed communion with Rome in 1628. Liturgical language is Albanian. Most Albanian Christians are Albanian Orthodox.\n \u0095 Belarussian/Byelorussian - Unknown number of Belarussians who returned to Rome in the 17th century. The liturgical language is Old Slavonic. The faithful can be found in Belarus, as well as Europe, the Americas and Australia.\n \u0095 Bulgarian - Bulgarians who returned to Rome in 1861. Liturgical language is Old Slavonic. The 20,000 faithful can be found in Bulgaria. Most Bulgarian Christians are Bulgarian Orthodox.\n \u0095 Czech - Czech Catholics of Byzantine Rite organized into a jurisdiction in 1996.\n \u0095 Krizevci - Croatian Catholics of Byzantine Rite who resumed communion with Rome in 1611. The liturgical language is Old Slavonic. The 50,000 faithful can be found in Croatia and the Americas. Most Croatians are Roman (Rite) Catholics.\n \u0095 Greek - Greek Christians who returned to Rome in 1829. The liturgical language is Greek. Only 2500 faithful in Greece, Asia Minor (Turkey) and Europe. Greek Christians are almost all Orthodox. Their Patriarch is the Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople.\n \u0095 Hungarian - Descendants of Ruthenians who returned to Rome in 1646. The liturgical languages are Greek, Hungarian and English. The 300,000 faithful are found in Hungary, Europe and the Americas.\n \u0095 Italo-Albanian - Never separated from Rome, these 60,000 Byzantine Rite Catholics are found in Italy, Sicily and the Americas. The liturgical languages are Greek and Italo-Albanian.\n \u0095 Melkite - Catholics from among those separated from Rome in Syria and Egypt who resumed Communion with Rome at the time of the Crusades. However, definitive union only came in the 18th century. Melkite Greek Patriarch of Damascus. Liturgical languages are Greek, Arabic, English, Portuguese and Spanish. The over 1 million Melkite Catholics can be found in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Canada, US, Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela and Australia.\n \u0095 Romanian - Romanians who returned to Rome in 1697. The liturgical language is Romanian. There are over 1 million Romanian Catholics in Romania, Europe and the Americas. Most Romanian Christians are Romanian Orthodox.\n \u0095 Russian - Russians who returned to communion with Rome in 1905. The liturgical language is Old Slavonic. An unknown number of the faithful in Russia, China, the Americas and Australia. Most Russian Christians are Russian Orthodox. Their Patriarch is the Orthodox Patriarch of Moscow.\n \u0095 Ruthenian - Catholics from among those separated from Rome in Russia, Hungary and Croatia who reunited with Rome in 1596 (Brest-Litovsk) and 1646 (Uzhorod).\n \u0095 Slovak - Byzantine Rite Catholics of Slovakian origin numbering 225,000 and found in Slovakia and Canada.\n \u0095 Ukrainian - Catholics from among those separated from Rome by the Greek Schism and reunited about 1595. Patriarch of Lvov. Liturgical languages are Old Slavonic and Ukrainian. The 5.5 million Ukrainian Catholics can be found in Ukraine, Poland, England, Germany, France, Canada, US, Brazil, Argentina and Australia. During the Soviet era Ukrainian Catholics were violently forced to join the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. Their hierarchy, which continued to exist outside the homeland, has since be re-established in the Ukraine.\n \n \n \n ALEXANDRIAN\n The Church of Alexandria in Egypt was one of the original centers of Christianity, since like Rome and Antioch it had a large Jewish population which was the initial object of apostolic evangelization. Its Liturgy is attributed to St. Mark the evangelist, and shows the later influence of the Byzantine Liturgy, in addition to its unique elements.\n \n \u0095 Coptic - Egyptian Catholics who returned to communion with Rome in 1741. The Patriarch of Alexandria leads the 200,000 faithful of this ritual Church spread throughout Egypt and the near east. The liturgical languages are Coptic (Egyptian) and Arabic. Most Copts are not Catholics.\n \n \u0095 Ethiopian/Abyssinian - Ethiopian Coptic Christians who returned to Rome in 1846. The liturgical language is Geez. The 200,000 faithful are found in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, and Jerusalem.",

They said that He was wholly a spectre - they argued that God could not have suffered on the Cross.\n \n Further, as He was not real in body, He was not 'born' in the sense of you or I, through a physical process. This then also meant that Mary could not be called \"The Birth-Giver of God\" (Theotokos).\n \n They are deemed heretics\n \n In confirming that Jesus was wholly corporeal, containing two natures, both Man and God, we concluded that Mary is in fact the Birth Giver of God.\n \n Thus historically the fact that Mary is a virgin, the Mother of God, etc, is intrinsically tied into the nature of Jesus.\n \n Further, this also shows that most Christians actually accept another doctrine of Holy Tradition - the nature of Jesus. It was argued by the heretics based on Bible passages that Jesus' suffering was not literal, but metaphorical.\n\n \n Reply to an old note but I have been away.

You did not ask a question, you stated a position. I also stated, read the thread, all of it where I have posted and you will clearly see the progression of my thoughts on Mary.\n \n As to the traditions and that concerning John living with Mary, that is an assumption not in evidence I think. John spent a great deal of time on Patmos. Where was Mary at that time? I don't know. I really don't. If you know then please tell me.\n \n As for Mary having children, my position was and is, that is debatable. Most of what you are saying was dealt with 60 posts back. That is why I say, read the thread and why I say that you are behind a bit.\n \n Catch up.",
