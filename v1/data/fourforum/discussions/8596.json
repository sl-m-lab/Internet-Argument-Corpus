   "The European Union will head up the diplomatic efforts. NATO will head up the military operation. The United Nations will head up the humanitarian and the monitoring of the border missions. The Arab League of Nations and the United States government will help support the roles of the European Union NATO and the United Nations in their missions. Each group will have a plan that is divided into tasks that will be delegated to individual nations or a team of nations. The Shabbat Farm region will be the main base for the international operations in the region. \n \n All four groups will work together to bringing about the needed change to accomplish the mission of long-term peace in the region. The Lebanese government will have an active role working with all four international groups. A website will be created outlining the goals and the progress or lack of progress in the operations. Worldwide transparency in the operation needed to build global confidence and coordination in the operation. \n \n Once the international community of nation gets involved in the peacekeeping operations of the Lebanon-Israeli border a time table will be established. The Lebanese government will work hand-in-hand step-by-step on each task with the different international operations. The first step will be to set up bases for each of the operations. While the bases are being established diplomatic and humanitarian efforts will be made. If efforts are met with military resistance from Hezbollah, NATO forces will come to the front line with the humanitarian efforts being put on the back burner. \n \n After the international base are completed and the fighting has quieted down an amnesty period will be established that the Lebanese people can turn in any heavy military armament to the Lebanese's authorities with no questioned asked. Providing there is no on going combat between the international operations and Hezbollah NATO's role will be a supporting role to the international humanitarian NGO's and Lebanese government. \n \n The first step is to build up the strength of the Lebanese National Army to the point so they have control of the land within their nation. The second is to have a political campaign to disarm the militant wing of Hezbollah of heavy military weapons in Lebanon. Only by winning over the hearts and minds of the Lebanese people will there be long lasting peace. The people of Lebanon have to be convinced there will be no attempts by the international coalitions to break-up or harm the political and social wing of the Hezbollah party. The mission of the international coalition is to disarm the militant wing of Hezbollah of bombs missiles and explosives and for the Federal Government of Lebanon to have control of the land within Lebanon. After some training of the Lebanese military and police forces a concerted effort will be made by NATO and the Lebanese forces to disarm the militant wing of Hezbollah. \n \n There will be three types of infrastructure that will be building by the international coalition. The first type will be permanent structures that will be turned over the Lebanese government or the United Nations for further use. The second will be permanent structures that will be turn over to the private sector for alternative private use with the Humanitarian NGOs having first options. The third will be temporary structures that will be dismantled at the end of operations. \n \n The creation of an official website for this operation will help the different parties involved as well as international observers to what and how things are going on the ground. An official timeline of the progress and of violations must be maintained. The website could help in the coordination of the many different actives that will be going on simultaneously. Each group will have there own section on the website that will be updated on a regularly basis. There will be a section that will be closed to the public for internal use only.",

   "it is articles like this that make me fully understand why the Muslims hate western mentality so much. it is because we are trying to control them and tell them how to live. all they want is to live under Muslim law. they don't want your NATO, EU, and UN forces. they want the world to be Muslim and you saying that the whole world will contribute to helping them make peace is not what they want. you claim you know better than them as to how to resolve this problem. their religion is how they define the world and how to live, not by your western standards. you are looking at this problem totally wrong. and the most ironic thing of all, is that you believe that they will listen to you. in your 'utopian' plan for peace and loving. NEWSFLASH: they have a totally different view of what utopia looks like.",
