   "Brief summary of information on Easter. I compiled this mostly from my few minutes of studies on About.Com. I think it's credible enough. Feel free to point out fallacies, though.\n \n The Date\n In Christianity Easter remains a celebration and memorial holiday for the ressurection of Jesus--believed to have occured three days after his death. Not only does Easter have connections with paganism, but it occurs at the same time of the Jewish Passover. Due to its connection to Passover it moves around on the calendar and has no fixed date. Before 325 CE Easter occured on a variety of different days of the week. The Council of Nicea passed the \"Easter Rule\" which set the Easter celebration on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox. (Not a \"scientific full moon\", but an ecclesiastical full moon and vernal equinox--which always occur on March 21st. Easter Sunday always falls between March 22nd and April 25th.)\n \n The Pagans\n The Easter bunny came from the Anglo-Saxon goddess of fertility--whose name was Eastre and its symbol was a rabbit. (Just in case: this acts as the source of the holiday's mascot and name.) German immigrants brought the Easter Bunny to America, though most ignored it until post-civil war--when the Easter holiday became more popular.\n \n As for the Easter Eggs. Predating Christian celebrations of Easter, pagan groups would exchange eggs as a representation of fertility and a hope that the year's following crops would be plentiful. These weres were sometiems painted with bright colors to represent the colors of spring.\n \n Goturuge",
