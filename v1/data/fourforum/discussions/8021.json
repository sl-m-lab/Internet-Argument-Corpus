   "Bit of an odd question but couldn't find anything in wikipedia where I foundthis. Was wondering if anyone knew why Indonesia has such a large muslim population (most populous muslim nation apparently) when its seperated from the main area where the religion is focused and has primarily Hindu India in between it and the rest of the mainly Islamic nations. Seems odd that it would just be spice traders if they didn't end up converting India as well despite being right next to them.",

   "I don't think it's just spice traders, the admirals of the chinese imperial fleets in the medieval period were largely muslim. I'm pretty sure parts of Indonesia were colonised by China at the time. India, however, has its own powerful empires and kingdoms, which would have insulated it a bit from colonisation and conversion.",

   "The Mogul Emperors were muslim as were the bulk of their Nawabs. However they are also descended from the Khans of Mongolia and drew their culture from the rule of Ghengis Khan et al. who allowed the native populations to practice their own religions. This is why Islam was able to spread eastwards but wasn't imposed upon the likes of India or Burma in the same way that Christainity was imposed on the population Europe by official decrees.\n The precise history of Indonesia lies outside my area of intrest but You may have better luck amongst Dutch posters.",

Supposedly there are 7 Imars that are revered for bringing Islam to the area. (From someone I know that lived in a tiny villiage in Indonesia for a year). There is the cave of the seven Imar's up in the mountains. They have an eclectiic mixuture of tranditional islamic values, and a more polenisian influence. For example, I am told in the village, women will bath in the stream with their breasts flapping in the wind for all to sea, yet, cheerfully waving at all passerby's, yet later on, be totally covered.\n \n My friend also told of going out to a remove village, and going to an island in the middle of a volcano where there was a centuries old abandoned Hindu temple. She said it was quite eerie being in a hindu cemetary that was overgrown in jungle vegetation.",
