It was recently published that if one of a pair of identical twins is homosexual, the other member of the pair will be, too, in just under 50 % of the cases.\n \n Two genetic researchers, one at one of the largest genetics departments in the country, the other at Harvard state:\n \n \"While the authors interpreted their findings as evidence for a genetic basis for homosexuality, we think that the data in fact provide strong evidence for the influence of the environment.\"\n \n Billings, P. and Beckwith, J.

Even so, if one identical twin was homosexual, only about half the time was the co-twin homosexual.\n \n Better research was based on twins who were recruited for other reasons, and later asked about their sexual orientatiuon.\n \n Known as \"registry\" studies, these gave a concordant rate between identical twins of less than 50%.\n \n The largest study, done by Bailey Martin and Others at the University of Queensland had 14,000+ twins and found that if one twin was homosexual, only 38% of the time was the other homosexual.\n \n Bailey, JM; DUNNE, MP; Martin, NG(2000): Genetic and Environmental influences on sexual orientation and its correlates in an Australian twin sample.

All may be influenced by genes, but not overwhelmingly determined by them.\n \n The critical factor is thatif one identical twin is homosexual, only sometimes is the co-twin homosexual.\n \n \n 3. From Dr. Dean Hamer, the \"gay gene\" researcher, and a gay man.\n \n \"Genes are hardware...the data of life's experiences are processed through the sexual software into the circuits of identity. I suspect the sexual software is a mixture of BOTH GENES and ENVIRONMENT., in much the same way the software of a computer is a mixture of what's installed at the factory and what's added by the user.\"\n \n P Copeland and D. Hamer(1994) The science of Desire. New York: Simon and Schuster.\n \n \n 4. \"Gay gene\" researcher, Dr. Hamer stated that homosexuality was NOT rooted solely in biology.\n \n He says: \"Absolutely not.

Genes don't control us, though.\n \n One can foil or foster genetic influences.\n \n Is there a gay gene?\n \n The \"genetic and unchangeable\" theory has been actively promoted by gay activists and the popular media. Is homosexuality really an inborn and normal variant of human nature?\n \n No research claims there is.\n \n \n 9. The author of the lead article on genes and behavior in a special issue of Science Magazine speaks of the renewed scientific recognition of the importance of environment.. He notes the growing understanding that:\n \n ...the interaction of genes and environment is much more complicated than the simple \"violence genes\" and \"intelligence genes\" touted in the popular press. the same data that show the effects of genes, also point to the enormous influenece of nongenetic factors.\n \n Mann, C.

Capitalized for emphasis only.\n \n A constatnt Stream of media articles---several per year---asure us that there is a link between homosexuality and biological features.\n \n The headlines imply that people are born with tendencies which will infallibly make them gay or lesbian, and that change of sexual orientation will be impossible.\n \n Individually some of theese pieces are not very convincing, but the sheer volume of them suggests that they must amount to an overwhelming influence---or if not, further research will add to them and make it so. This is not true either, and we see shortly that twin studies refute it.\n \n ...This article emphasizes studies of identical twins, which are sufficient for our purposes...\n \n Earlier studies mostly used informal or \"snowball\" samples of twins recruited from gay and lesbian associations...\n \n Such studies are possibly biased by the nature of twins who volunteer, but even so, if one identical twin was homosexual, only about half the time was the co-twin concordant(i.e. also homosexual).\n \n Better research however was based on twins who were recruited for other reasons, and only subsequently asked about their sexual orientation. These are known as \"registry\" studies and they similiarly gave a concordance rate between identical twins of less than 50%.\n \n *The study done by Bailey, Martin and others was previously mentioned*\n \n It found that if one twin was homosexual, 38% of the time his identical brother was too. For lesbianism the concordance rate ws 30%. Wheteher 30% or 50% concordance(snowball samples), all the studies agree it is clearly not 100%.\n \n The critical factor is that if one twin is homosexual, only sometimes is the co-twin homosexual. There is no argument about this in the scientific community.\n \n VERY IMPORTANT: Identical twins have identical genes. If homosexuality was a biological condition produced inescapably by the genes(e.g. eye color), then if one identical twin was homosexual, in 100% of the cases his brother would be too.\n But we know that only about 38% of the time is the identical twin brother homosexual.\n \n Genes are responsible for an indirect influence, but on average, they do NOT force people into homosexuality. This conclusion has been known in the scientific community for a few decades, but has not reached the general public.\n \n Will contuning research eventually find some overwhelming biological influences to produce homosexuality, or find that added together, all the biological influences are overwhelming? No. The twin studies prove that future research will never discover any overwhelming biological factors which compel homosexuality.\n \n The scientific truth is - our genes don't force us into anything. But we can support or supress our genetic tendencies. We can foster or foil them. If we reinforce our genetic tendencies thousands of times(even if only through homoerotic fantasy), is it surprising that it is hard to change? \n \n Similiarly, we have the genetic tendency to eat, but it is possible to foster this tendency and overeat for the pleasure it brings. If we repeat that often enough, we will not only reinforce a genetic tendency to become overweight, but find that \"starving\" the habit takes a long time.\n \n In summary:\n \n 1. No scientist believes genes by themselves infallibly make us behave in specified ways. Genes create a tendency, not a tyranny.\n \n 2. Identical twin studies show that neither genetic nor family factors are overwhelming.\n \n 3. Conclusion 2 will not be altered by any research in the future.\n \n 4. We can foster or foil genetic or family influences.\n \n 5. Change is possible.\n \n To read this entire scientific article, as well as to view the references, Click here\n \n \n 12.

All had totally stifled the scientific inquiry that would be necessary to stimulate such a discussion. It remains very politically incorrect--very marginalizing--to even make the suggestion of a dialogue that opens up the question of the normality of homosexuality.\"\n \n \"...and so NARTH was founded; It became clear that we must have a credible secular organization which could move beyond the strife and misinformation.\"\n \n To read the entire article by Benjamin Kaufman, M.D.\n \n Click Here\n \n \n 15.

   "Please...Spitzer said that many cannot change in his view. But said that some can. And the treatment is there to help those that can be changed, as well as PREVENTATIVE techniques.\n\n \n Spitzer did not say anything about preventative techniques. The sample was not representative of gays and lesbians in general. The sample consisted of biased activists referred by Narth and Exodus, who were from those biased \"ex-gay\" political organizations. The minority of the sample were exclusively attracted to those of same sex. A good critical analysis and analogy is offered at this site...\n \n http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_changing.html\n \n It's no wonder Spitzer himself said his sample was limited and not representative, in the first article I posted from Psychiatric News.\n \n \nAs well Spitzer is quoted as saying that for the participants in his study there was no evidence of harm. \"To the contrary\", he says \"they reported that it was helpful in a variety of ways beyond changing sexual orientation itself.\"\n\n \n Again the sample is not representative of gays and lesbians in general, and is referred by biased organizations. 93% were very religious or extremely religious, so it may have helped them in their religious conservative life. It is like the tobacco company referring a sample of its consumers who already are sold on the tobacco company's brand of cigarette. \n \n \nGay rights activists rioted,\n\n \n What riots?

   "This is really kind of sad. You obviously are too silly or willfully blind to understand what an unbiased and generalizable sample is, or else you are trying to mislead on purpose. \n \n Bieber studied his own patients, whom Bieber was treating for homosexuality. Here is an excellent explanation...\n \n http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_mental_health.html#hooker\n \n Later psychoanalysts did not follow this view, however. Sandor Rado (1940, 1949) rejected Freud's assumption of inherent bisexuality, arguing instead that heterosexuality is inborn and that homosexuality is a phobic response to members of the other sex. Other analysts later argued that homosexuality resulted from pathological family relationships during the oedipal period (around 4-5 years of age) and claimed that they observed these patterns in their homosexual patients (Bieber et al., 1962). \n Charles Socarides (1968) speculated that the etiology of homosexuality was pre-oedipal and, therefore, even more pathological than had been supposed by earlier analysts (for a detailed history, see Lewes, 1988; for briefer summaries, see Bayer, 1987; Silverstein, 1991). \n \n \n Biases in psychoanalysis Although psychoanalytic theories of homosexuality have had considerable influence in psychiatry and in the larger culture, they have not been subjected to rigorous empirical testing. Instead, they have been based on analysts' clinical observations of patients already known by them to be homosexual. \n Two major problems result from this procedure. First, the analyst's theoretical orientations, expectations, and personal attitudes are likely to bias her or his observations. This is why scientists take great pains in their studies to ensure that the researchers who actually collect the data do not have expectations about how a particular research participant will respond. An example is the \"double blind\" procedure used in many experiments. Such procedures have not been used in clinical psychoanalytic studies of homosexuality. (See Rosenthal, 1976, for a discussion of how a researcher's expectations can unintentionally influence her or his findings.) \n \n A second problem with psychoanalytic studies is that they have only examined homosexuals who were already under psychiatric care - in other words, homosexuals who were seeking treatment or therapy. Patients, however, are probably not representative of well-adjusted individuals in the general population. Just as it would be inappropriate to draw conclusions about all heterosexuals based only on data from heterosexual psychiatric patients, we cannot generalize from observations of homosexual patients to the entire population of gay men and lesbians. \n \n \n Hooker's study \n Hooker's (1957) study was innovative in several important respects. First, rather than simply accepting the predominant view of homosexuality as pathology, she posed the question of whether homosexuals and heterosexuals differed in their psychological adjustment. Second, rather than studying psychiatric patients, she recruited a sample of homosexual men who were functioning normally in society. Third, she employed a procedure that asked experts to rate the adjustment of men without prior knowledge of their sexual orientation. This method addressed an important source of bias that had vitiated so many previous studies of homosexuality. \n \n Hooker administered three projective tests (the Rorschach, Thematic Apperception Test [TAT], and Make-A-Picture-Story [MAPS] Test) to 30 homosexual males and 30 heterosexual males recruited through community organizations. The two groups were matched for age, IQ, and education. None of the men were in therapy at the time of the study. \n Unaware of each subject's sexual orientation, two independent Rorschach experts evaluated the men's overall adjustment using a 5-point scale. They classified two-thirds of the heterosexuals and two-thirds of the homosexuals in the three highest categories of adjustment. When asked to identify which Rorschach protocols were obtained from homosexuals, the experts could not distinguish respondents' sexual orientation at a level better than chance. \n \n A third expert used the TAT and MAPS protocols to evaluate the psychological adjustment of the men. As with the Rorschach responses, the adjustment ratings of the homosexual and heterosexuals did not differ significantly. \n \n Hooker concluded from her data that homosexuality as a clinical entity does not exist and that homosexuality is not inherently associated with psychopathology. \n \n Hooker's findings have since been replicated by many other investigators using a variety of research methods. Freedman (1971), for example, used Hooker's basic design to study lesbian and heterosexual women. Instead of projective tests, he administered objectively-scored personality tests to the women. His conclusions were similar to those of Hooker. \n \n Although some investigations published since Hooker's study have claimed to support the view of homosexuality as pathological, they have been methodologically weak. Many used only clinical or incarcerated samples, for example, from which generalizations to the population at large are not possible. Others failed to safeguard the data collection procedures from possible biases by the investigators - for example, a man's psychological functioning would be evaluated by his own psychoanalyst, who was simultaneously treating him for his homosexuality. \n \n Some studies found differences between homosexual and heterosexual respondents, and then assumed that those differences indicated pathology in the homosexuals. For example, heterosexual and homosexual respondents might report different kinds of childhood experiences or family relationships. It would then be assumed that the patterns reported by the homosexuals indicated pathology, even though there were no differences in psychological functioning between the two groups. \n \n \n The weight of evidence In a review of published studies comparing homosexual and heterosexual samples on psychological tests, Gonsiorek (1982) found that, although some differences have been observed in test results between homosexuals and heterosexuals, both groups consistently score within the normal range. Gonsiorek concluded that \"Homosexuality in and of itself is unrelated to psychological disturbance or maladjustment. Homosexuals as a group are not more psychologically disturbed on account of their homosexuality\" (Gonsiorek, 1982, p. 74; see also reviews by Gonsiorek, 1991; Hart, Roback, Tittler, Weitz, Walston & McKee, 1978; Reiss, 1980). \n Confronted with overwhelming empirical evidence and changing cultural views of homosexuality, psychiatrists and psychologists have radically altered their views during the last two decades.",
