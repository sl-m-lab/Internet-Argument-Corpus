   "He (Lazare) did not refer to Dawkins as a boor. He implied some other author (Eagleton) did. While some criticism is leveled, the article is fairly complimentary toward Dawkins. \n \n Interestingly, in a slam against religion he states, \"But then certain enthusiasts took things too far ... by launching a global crusade to rid the world of evil and declaring the jury still out on Darwinian evolution. As a consequence, religion now looks nearly as bad as royalism did in the late eighteenth century.\"\n \n I don't see where this article coincides with WW usual point of view. It is merely saying that religion serves a societal function and recent proponents of atheism don't seem to offer any adequate alternative. What has this got to do with the Creation/Evolution debate?",

Secular humanism simply does not, cannot, fill the spiritual vacuum in our individual spirits once the old notion of an abrahamic, anthropomorphic superhuman 'god' has been erased from our psyches.
