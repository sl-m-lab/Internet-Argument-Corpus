   "Euro's rise is linked to good news this time (IHT)\n \n \nA mixture of brisk exports and accelerating economic growth is persuading investors to take shelter in the euro as the dollar continues a relentless downward trajectory. The dollar's decline - which affects Asian currencies as well - has accelerated since the end of March as the huge U.S. current account deficit widens further, and the Federal Reserve signals that it may pause its 2- year long cycle of raising interest rates\n\n \n \nOn Monday, the euro hit $1.2787 before slipping to 1.2703, still up sharply from $1.22 in early April. The dollar also eased to \u00a5111.670 from \u00a5112.485 late Friday, and continued a decline against the Swiss franc and the British pound.\n\n \n \n\"This is the beginning of the dollar downtrend that we've all been waiting for,\" said Tony Norfield at ABN AMRO in London. \"It has arrived.\"\n\n \n So are the grim predictions the fiscal conservatives have been voicing starting to realise?\n \n I'm pro-balancing the books as far as fiscal policy is concerned, btw, but I'll readily admit my knowledge of economics is too limited to analyse a good national economic policy from a bad one. Reading back on threads here just sparked my interest in the dollar ;)",

   "Here's an informative article on both the Iranians and the threat to the dollar.\n \n \nSynopsis:\n It is not yet clear if a U.S. military expedition will occur in a desperate attempt to maintain petrodollar supremacy. Regardless of the recent National Intelligence Estimate that down-graded Iran's potential nuclear weapons program, it appears increasingly likely the Bush administration may use the specter of nuclear weapon proliferation as a pretext for an intervention, similar to the fears invoked in the previous WMD campaign regarding Iraq. \n \n If recent stories are correct regarding Cheney's plan to possibly use another 9/11 terrorist attack as the pretext or casus belli for a U.S. aerial attack against Iran, this would confirm the Bush administration is prepared to undertake a desperate military strategy to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions, while simultaneously attempting to prevent the Iranian oil Bourse from initiating a euro-based system for oil trades. \n \n However, as members of the U.N. Security Council; China, Russia and E.U. nations such as France and Germany would likely veto any U.S.-sponsored U.N. Security Resolution calling the use of force without solid proof of Iranian culpability regarding a terrorist attack in the U.S. A unilateral military strike on Iran would isolate the U.S. government in the eyes of the world community, and it is conceivable that such an overt action could provoke other industrialized nations to strategically abandon the dollar en masse. \n \n Indeed, such an event would create pressure for OPEC and Russia to move towards a monopoly petroeuro system in an effort to cripple the U.S. dollar and thwart the U.S. global military presence. I refer to this in my book as the \"rogue nation hypothesis.\" (A similar tactic was used by the U.S. to end the 1956 Suez crisis.)\n \n While central bankers throughout the world community would be extremely reluctant to 'dump the dollar,' the reasons for any such drastic reaction are likely straightforward from their government's perspective - the global community is dependent on the oil and gas energy supplies found in the Persian Gulf. \n \n Hence, industrialized nations would likely move in tandem on the currency exchange markets in an effort to thwart the neoconservatives from pursuing their desperate strategy of dominating the world's largest hydrocarbon energy supply. Any such efforts that resulted in a dollar currency crisis would be undertaken - not to cripple the U.S. dollar and economy as punishment towards the American people per se - but rather to thwart further unilateral warfare and its potentially destructive effects on the critical oil production and shipping infrastructure in the Persian Gulf. \n \n Barring a U.S. attack, it appears imminent that Iran's euro-denominated oil bourse will open in March 2006. Logically, the most appropriate U.S. strategy is compromise with the E.U. and OPEC towards a dual-currency system for international oil trades.\n\n \n The worst thing about all this is that it seems that there's a huge consensus by the media and the people in the know how to talk in very small letters and hushed voices about the truckload of nitro heading towards your house. In 5 years or so I think economic historians will have a great job understanding why there were no buzz about this.",

   "As a Master of History and layman practioner I have limited understanding too but what are your assessment of the collateral damage daewoo?\n\n \n \n Depends. Inflation is a foregone conclusion for any goods not coming from China. Chinese goods can stay at their current price, provided they do not move the yuan peg (which we are applying tremendous pressure to move). Not only will inflation be pretty significant for imported goods, but American made goods with significant imported components will also increase (this is most American goods). \n \n The dollar fall comes at an especially bad time considering the run up in energy prices. Typically manufacturers and distributors will try to stabilize prices by eating small to moderate increases in costs. They are already eating higher energy costs. The margin is simply not there for them to eat an additional increse due to a weaker dollar, so it seems likely that we will see inflationary increases much more quickly than is typical. \n \n The other problem this is going to cause is essentially a self perpetuating slide of the dollar as big currency traders (institutional funds, central banks, corporate accounts, etc...) kill off their dollar holdings. Already in the last several weeks we have seen several MASSIVE moves as large funds liquidate dollar holdings. \n \n From a practical standpoint if we do not see a reversal of the current trend (and a reversal is required, a slowing would not be enough) we will without question be facing a dollar crash. Massive inflation, unemployment, an equity market crash, and essentially another depression. \n \n Our economic fundamentals leading intot he great depression were FAR, FAR better than they are right now. With our inflated equity and real estate markets, debt/earnings ratio, negative savings rate, cost of servicing our current debt, including realistic assesments of increased costs to service same debt factoring in a falling dollar, increased energy costs, and we are essentially facing the perfect economic storm. \n \n I can only guess how bad thigns are likely to get. Looking at the data, there is no real indicator of a bottom. There are simply not very many positives to the US economy. It will take 30-50 years for us to rebuild our industrial infrastructure to the point it needs to be in order for us to have a sustainable economy.",

Virtually all US domestic companies and individuals have switched to tax deferred, individual retirement plans, which I call 401S for sucker.

Every issue you point out is volatile enough on its own to create serious economic damage, but the two that stand out in my thinking are debt service and equity markets. \n\n \n The biggest problem as I see it is that all of the factors feed off of each other. None are really isolated. A decline in the housing market will drag down equity markets, dollar value, lower our savings rate even more, and drive the dollar through the floor, which will cause the cost of servicing our debt to skyrocket. \n \n A decline in equities would crash the housing market, lower savings rates, crash the dollar, and boost debt service costs.\n \n A decline in the dollar independantly will crash both real estate and equity markets, cost us a fortune in debt service cost, and drive up energy costs.\n \n A continuation of the trend in energy costs will crash the housing market, crash the equity markets, crash the dollar, and send debt service costs skyrocketing.\n \n The truly horrifying thing is that even without the others to feed off of, all of these events have a high likelyhood of happening on their own. \n \n Personally, I don't see any possibility of a soft landing or any kind of reversal wihtout a depression.

The Indians, the chinese? Us old worlders?\n\n \n that depends on who you ask and their viewpoint. To many people with a western centric view of the world, the demise and collapse of the dollar will lead to worldwide economic collapse. \n \n On the other hand, I was reading a well supported articel the other day from a chinese economist who basically said that a dollar crash would lead to a \"mild to moderate\" recession that MIGHT last as long as 5 years for the chinese because they are ready to bring markets online in large portions of the ME, Africa, Canada, and Asia relatively quickly.\n \n I think what we are seeing here is not just the decline of th United states as an empire but hte decline of the west as the center of global influence and prosperity. In the ME in countries where the west has not ensured that tyrannical dictators are running the place, you see a movement towards non oil specific economies. In asia they are coming leaps and bounds. Even much of africa is ripe for economic expansion. \n \n In the west (europe included) we have used up our resources, inflated our standard of living to an unsustainable level, and have essentially profited over the last several generations not thorough production but through exploitation of the rest of the world. The expolited are not longer happy with this arrangement.",

After that the fall will be harder, but the US has already reached the point where it doesn't really matter anymore. To use an analogy: it doesn't matter if you get shot in the face by a handgun or a shotgun, the end result is still the same (i.e. death) but one is a bit more messy than the other.\n \n \nAs far as the second, I can almost see that working, if we take and hold those territories and loot them as the nazis did.\n\n Considering that the US is building an embassy the size of the Vatican in Iraq in addition to 4 giant bases I think it's safe to say that the US will stay in Iraq for a long, long time.\n Iraq will also probably serve as a \"beachhead\" from which the US can strike anywhere in the Middle East.",

The Bush administration was essentially looking for a second shot at implementing neocon ideaology. The world simply does not seem inclined to give them such a second chance. I, too, could not help but notice the Bush administration, and certainly Ms Rice in particular, have been making a concerted effort to convey the imprssion that theya re the mouthpiece for the entire planet.
