   "Here is some more news from the hot corner of the world - Iraq. Yesterday, I was reading some materials concerning the facts of disobedience of U.S. soldiers who refused orders for one reason or another.\n \n It was said there that sharp deterioration of discipline was checked among U.S. soldiers - even in elite combat units. Experts note, that it is mainly for the psychological stress, severe climatic conditions and lack of secure relaxation within the encampments. \n \n Starting from the beginning of the year 2005, there were over 100 cases of disobedience among U.S. soldiers in Iraq who refuse orders - it has to do especially with patrol work and conveyance of Army fuel, ammunition and food across Iraq, especially in the locations with high risk of assault by Iraqi rebels.\n \n There was a certain case, when 18 soldiers at a time collectively refused order to convey in the field of operation. What is convincing, these were all native U.S. citizens - judging by statistics, U.S. native soldiers are more likely to disobey (as distinguished from those who were only claiming for residence permit before they joined the Army and went to Iraq).\n \n Among other things, U.S. soldiers and officers started suffering from mental disorders (over 6,000 cases from the beginning of the year 2005). Instant growth of intentional self-mutilation also takes place - soldiers break the bones of their arms and leg, eat soap, sometimes they even send a bullet through a leg or swallow nails - all sort of things to be sent to hospital in the back area or, better, to be sent home being disabled.\n \n Of course these people often face investigation. Since January, 2005, over 100 cases of disobedience were brought before military court - over 6,000 cases of abandonment of a post and over 10,000 cases of order denials and self-mutilation since the start of the campaign in Iraq. Unfortunately, over 80% of the convicted people were native Americans.",

Unfortunately, over 80% of the convicted people were native Americans.\n\n \n I like to point out a statistic that is often left unnoticed. The leadership in the US military is...****ING RETARDED. Leadership in the US military consists of 2 general stereotypes. 1. People with degrees in something which might have absolutely nothing to do with what they do in the military, and for those who have worked under someone who was placed in a supervisory role merely because they have a degree, c'mon most of them couldn't lead themselves out of a wet paper bag. 2. Losers who upon the end of their original enlistment take a look at themselves and ask \"Gee, do I really think I can make it out in the real world? I mean here I'll be senior and if I stay in long enough I'll eventually be in charge.\" Wow, no wonder people are disobeying, would you follow an idiot who was afraid to hack it in the real world?",
