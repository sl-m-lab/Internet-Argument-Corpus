   "http://www.johnshepler.com/articles/cincodemayo.html\n \n This explains more about Cinco de Mayo and how it helped the United States.\n\n Very interesting article. I only wish Mexican-Americans (and everyone else for that matter) celebrated Cinco de Mayo because of how it helped the U.S. I have always been slightly irritated that we celebrate the independence of some other country. \n \n The article also makes another point. As the author writes: \n \n \"With the North and South reunited, Lincoln ordered the French out of Mexico and sent a military force to the Texas/Mexican border under General Phil Sheridan. Napoleon potentially faced 2 million battle hardened U.S. veterans if he persisted in the occupation of Mexico. In early 1867, Napoleon made the decision to withdraw his troops. Maximilian surrendered his Mexican Imperial Army on May 15. The sovereignty of Mexico was returned to the Mexicans.\"\n \n It sounds to me like Mexican Independence should be celebrated on May 15, and Mexicans should be thanking the Americans for it.",
