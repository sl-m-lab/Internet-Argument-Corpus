That is just a lame cover up for bad parenting. It is the parents' job to monitor what games their kids are playing. And it is the job of the employee at the video game store to abide by the rating of the game...don't sell a Mature Audience game to a 7 year old. If the parents want their kids to play the game, then fine, let the parents buy the game. It is the parents duty to inform their kid that what is in the game is fake/illegal, and that if he tries to do what he sees in the game that he will be punished.",
