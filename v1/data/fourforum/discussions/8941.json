   "Well we have more resources and tools for kids these days which makes learning have different spins on it now. Like in Math there is plain old Pre-Calc. which is the basic figure it out problem solving like in the old days, but now there is Applied Math that teaches you how to take information out of a question and put it accordingly into formulas on computers. \n \n So there is new techniques. But as far as school being harder, no way. With gym becoming mandatory all over and kids being introduced in younger ages to Band, Art, I.A., Home Ec. and such there is more alternate courses and teachers are not nearly as strict on homework or learning advantages. I do not call myself the smartest person in my class but I left grade 12 with 90% + marks as the course were not that demanding IMO.",

Personally, I see the calculator as a tool for completing a task. I don't really see anything wrong with using a calculator as long as you end up with the correct answer. However, it is important that students understand the basic concepts behind what the calculator is doing; I think this is the fundamental problem. Kids are punching numbers into their calculators and getting an answer and not really understanding the real math behind the problem. I don't think this is the fault of a calculator though.

Take simplifying roots. Not getting a value, but simplifying. Calculators don't do that.
