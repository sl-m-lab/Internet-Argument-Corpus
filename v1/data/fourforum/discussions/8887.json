   "These are Ruby-throated humming birds. About 3\" long. We've had a flock of them since about Aug 10. They are on their migration to southern Mexico and Central America for the winter. Most will die out over the gulf.\n \n They are feeding at a window feeder. They learn pretty quickly to tolerate us standing inside of the window. These pictures look like I was very close because I was very close.\n \n #1 - an adult male\n #2 - a juvenile male, just getting his \"ruby\" throat\n #3 - same juvenile\n #4 - a male guarding a feeder\n #5 - a female\n \n DINOSAURS",

If not, what shutter speed did you use?\n\n In my admittedly lay opinion, it originally looked to me as if he were about to take off. On the other hand, it may be that he is in the process of landing and folding his wings. The fact that his feet appear clamped on the \"seat\" I think supports this view.\n \n Looking again, the fact that he's got his head turned away from the feeder makes me think he's leaving. Maybe one of these days I'll make up my mind.\n \n But yes, in any case, great pics.",

I think he was in the process of starting a flutter.\n \n Here are some MORE DINOSAURS\n \n #1 - an albino I saw in Rockport a couple of years ago\n #2 - I was standing a arm's length away trying to get a picture of a butterfly that my wife wanted heard the hum, looked up and snapped.\n #3 - a female that didn't mind when we were around\n #4 - this one hit the window. I got to it just after the dog. She didn't hurt it but just had it in her mouth. I left it in this little carton with some food for about an hour - until it started to flutter around. I opened the box, it rose like a helicopter to eye level, looked at me for a second and then flew to a tree and sat there scolding me. The feather is a primary flight feather from the left wing - the only damage it seemed to have suffered. The feather is exactly 1\" long.\n #5 - a male landing at the feeder.\n #6 - a female feeding on the fly.\n \n All of the pictures are taken with one of two Sony digital cameras that I have. Most are with a 7.2 mega pixel Cyber-shot. Some are with a 1.6 mega pixel FD Mavica.",
