This belief indicates that I should do this for homosexuals as much as anyone else.\n\n \n That's fine, but I believe (and I think you would probably agree with me) that the originator of this thread meant religion in the sense of a relationship with God.\n \n \nMany gay people attend Christian churches which approve of homosexuality.\n\n \n Yes, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything.\n \n \nThese churches are incredibly common. There are many gay priests. Lots of people believe in these religions.\n\n \n Do you mean openly gay priests? Because actually, that's not the case. Maybe there are many who are aren't \"out\", but who knows? There are some denominations that try to avoid viewing homosexuality as a sin. But I don't know that I'd say they are incredibly common.\n \n \nAnd what if they didn't? Is one man's religion worth less because no one else believes it? It amazes me that you can so bluntly say that your religion is more real than mine\n\n \n It's not a matter of saying what's more real or not, it's a matter of noting what a person's priorities are. Look, if sexuality and gay activism is a bigger issue than God, yet he claims to be a Christian, what do you expect people to say?\n \n \nI am promoting a religious belief of mine in public, but my religion is not the reason I'm promoting it. \n\n \n In that case, I'm not sure it's relevant this this thread's discussion. If religion is not the reason you promote it, then you aren't doing it out of religion. It may be compatible with whatever religious beliefs you hold to, but it's not really a religious stance for you.\n \n \nI'm not trying to make anyone live like me or believe like me, so I am not using this forum as a puplit. I think that's where you misunderstand the gay rights movement completely. The gay rights movement isn't about forcing people to do or believe something they don't want to\n\n \n You say that, but in fact there's no way to do what you want to do in our country without forcing people to change their views. So in effect you are trying to force people to change their religious beliefs.\n \n But we're getting pretty far off-topic here.",

But I like to think that even if my religion did not, I would support freedom of religion and of action to the point that I would still fight to legalize gay rights, for that freedom is in the best interest of everyone.\n \n \nYou say that, but in fact there's no way to do what you want to do in our country without forcing people to change their views.

   "Jyoshu: Where do you get that sexuality is a bigger issue for religious gays than God?\n \n Straight people celebrate their sexuality in their religion all the time, such as through marriage. Gay people do the same thing in religious groups that accept their sexuality. In religious groups that do not, obviously gays won't express sexuality in equal ways with heterosexuals, expecting the same acceptance and support. Although, the gay members may try to change things from within. That doesn't meant that sexuality is more important than God. It's more like accepting gay sexuality to be God-given, as with heterosexuality. Where it is not accepted, there may be more work to do in regards to that sexuality, compared to with the accepted sexuality. The accepted sexuality, being straight, is just accepted, and no one makes it an issue by repressing it, or treating it as inequal to anything else. Those religious people repressing the expression of gay sexuailty, are also making it an issue just as those who want it treated as equal to being straight, are making it an issue. It could be said that some in the former group are making opposing homosexuality a bigger issue than God or other aspects of the religion.",

I also believe that the Bible was referring to HETEROSEXUAL people who engaged in HOMOSEXUAL activities. It is a sin for gay people to engage in heterosexual sex. Most of the gay folks on this site just don't want the government to discriminate against them. Homophobia, sexism, Color Prejudice, and any other type of prejudice should not exist.

   "Matt,\n \n You know that I am gay...right?\n ok...\n I had to give up on religion. Why? I was condemned for doing a belly flop in Pakistan..it was in a mock olyimic contest, but the church trial found me guilty. I gave up on religion and yes god. \n I tend to be more of \"if it fails the test it does not work\" kind of guy.\n Before the above, I was living with a couple who had a cabin.\n I lived there and the church thought i was ****ing the lady I paid rent to...\n So they kicked me out.\n I put 12 years of my life into religion and tried not to play it off like i was not gay.\n I lost. \n and so did religion for that matter.\n I am asking did you guys give up on religion for like reasons.\n\n \n I had my moments of doubt, yes, as any human being will. But I haven't given up on my beliefs/religion. \n \n Although I do feel many religions have given up on me. \n Insted of inclusiveness, they preach seperatism and demonizing me and those like me because the other humans in said religions aren't able to accept or understand that I am as human as they are. \n Personally, I am not missing anything by not going to an organized religious meeting every week. I know my personal beliefs and have learned to reconcile my doubts. \n \n Just because one \"church\" gives up on you, it doesn't mean you should give up on your beliefs or faith. \n But if you choose to do so, it is your choice as a human being. \n \n I have no problem with those who have given up on religion, it's their choice to do so. I don't judge them for it, exclude them from being part of my life because of it, nor would I ever back any laws which would exclude them from being equal citizens for it. \n \n What bothers me is why jyoshu even felt this was a necessary thread in the first place. I don't see how it has anything to do with \"Gay Rights\" or the rights of gays as equal citizens. \n I see this entire thread as lost leader, a weapon of mass distraction, a farce for his own personal ammusement.",

   "I have never known of a self-proclaimed \"religious gay person\" for whom their sexuality or gay activism was not their primary issue.

Their sexuality would be a minor issue in their life.\n\n \"I have never known of a self-proclaimed \"religious gay person\" \".
