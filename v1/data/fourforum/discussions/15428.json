   "From the link:\n \nWater from the city's five open air reservoirs, all in parks, goes directly to customers. The reservoirs are due to be replaced by underground storage within a decade, a result of federal requirements.\n\n So the water coming directly from these reservoirs goes right into peoples homes...yet someone thinks that a couple drops off urine is going to make it disgusting? \n \n I think that the public official(s) who decided it should be drained should pay the 36k out of their own pockets. That is rediculous. And shame on the city for having such an archaic and potentially dangerous water treatment / distribution system in the first place. If the public can easily get close enough to contaminate the supply with urine, what about some terrorist freak with a vial of anthrax?",
