   "Does religion set us up for failure?\n \n From all arms of the forum i see arguments originating from the apparent unacceptable/intolerable behavior considered by the religious.

Why does religion place conditions on this love?\n \n How is religion suppose to be a good thing when it causes so much pain to those it is suppose to love, shelter and protect.\n If i were to raise my children Christian am i not placing major restrictions on their freedom?\n Even if my views on Christianity were moderate, wouldn't i still be responsible for enforcing and subjecting my children to a world where judgment from its allies were not so forgiving?\n \n I summon this debate not as an attack by any standard, I'm agnostic, simply in the name of true understanding and contemplation. emoticon_smile\n \n Ps; Happy New Year Everyone emoticon_xhoho",

I'm beginning to wonder if the indoctrine of our children into any religion will be inevitably setting them up for major failure.

For example, many non-religious families may set goals of keeping their kids off drugs, and their teenagers may say they won't try drugs, but many teens still will end up trying pot at some point. Does that mean setting a 'no drugs' rule in a family is setting them up for failure? maybe so, but so what? It's still not a bad thing to do. I think we all sometimes probably do this, religious or not, by simply setting standards that have a good chance of failure due to the pressures of society, and therefore it's more an issue of standards and goals than a problem with 'religion'. Doesn't mean religion shouldn't set standards. That's the way I see it anyway.",

   "\"Humanist manifestos\" proclaiming perfection for some? Show me. \n\n \n I never said they \"proclaim perfection\", I said they believe certain humans can be perfect. They make every indication that they believe they can attain it, at least to a far greater extent than it ever has before. \n \n \nReally?? Where does the 'humanist manifestos' say that? I would like you to back that assertion up with evidence. \n\n \n A few of Humanist Manifesto 1's highlights;\n \n \nToday man's larger understanding of the universe, his scientific achievements, and deeper appreciation of brotherhood, have created a situation which requires a new statement of the means and purposes of religion. Such a vital, fearless, and frank religion capable of furnishing adequate social goals and personal satisfactions may appear to many people as a complete break with the past. \n\n \n \"Vital, fearless, and frank, capable of furnishing\"? Furnishing what has never been furnished before, obviously.\n \n \nHumanism recognizes that man's religious culture and civilization, as clearly depicted by anthropology and history, are the product of a gradual development due to his interaction with his natural environment and with his social heritage. The individual born into a particular culture is largely molded by that culture. \n\n \n and;\n \n \nMan will learn to face the crises of life in terms of his knowledge of their naturalness and probability. Reasonable and manly attitudes will be fostered by education and supported by custom. \n\n \n They seem to have it all figured out, don't they? \n \n \nThe humanists are firmly convinced that existing acquisitive and profit-motivated society has shown itself to be inadequate and that a radical change in methods, controls, and motives must be instituted. A socialized and cooperative economic order must be established to the end that the equitable distribution of the means of life be possible. The goal of humanism is a free and universal society in which people voluntarily and intelligently cooperate for the common good. Humanists demand a shared life in a shared world. \n\n \n This paragraph shows that they believe there are only some perfect humanists. If they believed all humanists were randomly mutated and naturally selected equally, why would they have a problem with individual earnings in a profit motivated society? \"Methods, controls, and motives must be \"instituted\". Not instituted by each individual in their own lives, (that's what profit-motivated, individual responsibility is) instituted by only a few, anointed humanists. Socialism or Communism? \n \n \nSo stand the theses of religious humanism. Though we consider the religious forms and ideas of our fathers no longer adequate, the quest for the good life is still the central task for mankind. Man is at last becoming aware that he alone is responsible for the realization of the world of his dreams, that he has within himself the power for its achievement. He must set intelligence and will to the task. \n\n \n \"Man is at last becoming aware\" - yes, more perfect than ever before. \n \n \nPerhaps you have a link to the 'humanist manifestos'? \n\n \n Perhaps\n \n \nWhich group is that?? Is that 'humanist manifestos' representative of the majority of humanists? \n\n \n I wouldn't know - I'm not a humanist and don't care enough to know. If there are different factions of humanists that have different manifestos that clash, I haven't noticed any evidence of their existance. What is there in the above manifesto that you suspect other humanists would disagree with? \n \n \nYou make some mighty strong claims against another group. It would behoove you to back it up.\n\n \n Humanists make mighty strong claims against Christians too, and some mighty strong claims about \"profit motivated society\", the Constitutional way of life in the U.S. They are a faction - something that Federalist Paper #10 warns us about. \n \n Federalist 10\n \nBy a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.\n \n There are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction: the one, by removing its causes; the other, by controlling its effects. \n\n \n That was James Madison's description of it, Dictionary.com can also be used to clarify it;\n \n \nA party, in political society, combined or acting in union, in opposition to the government, or state; -- usually applied to a minority, but it may be applied to a majority; a combination or clique of partisans of any kind, acting for their own interests, especially if greedy, clamorous, and reckless of the common good. \n\n \n (back to Federalist 10)\n \nThere are again two methods of removing the causes of faction: the one, by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence; the other, by giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions, and the same interests. \n\n \n As a religious person, I have an equal passion to keep humanists out of my life as they have to intrude into it. \n \n So religion doesn't \"set us up for failure\" as the OP asks, it helps maintian U.S founding principles by helping to keep cliques of partisans from dismantling them.",

In fact I think one of the great strong-points of religion is that it rather often helps people deal with failure--the whole Christian religion is largely based on the idea of forgiveness and atonement for sins\n\n \n I love the this theory :), unfortunatley if it were a constant reality there would be no need for me to consider otherwise. Forgiveness does not equal acceptance of those whose sins are; gay, falling in love with someone of another race, denomination ... Forgiveness usually come with a condition to repent.. for these people though, they have done nothing wrong.\n \n \n \nThe bottom line is, religion no more sets people up for failure than setting any sort of goals that will often not be met.

It's still not a bad thing to do. \n\n \n All families, religious or not, try to steer children away from drugs, thats a social goal. Its not really an example of how the athiests would be setting their children up for failure.\n \n \n \n\n I think we all sometimes probably do this, religious or not, by simply setting standards that have a good chance of failure due to the pressures of society\n \n \n Totally agree, we set our children up for failure with our own personal expectation plus societies.

Doesn't mean religion shouldn't set standards. That's the way I see it anyway.\n\n \n Yes and no, we established that we have our own expectations, plus societies then you add religion.",

   "...I think one of the great strong-points of religion is that it rather often helps people deal with failure--the whole Christian religion is largely based on the idea of forgiveness and atonement for sins, for example.\n\n \n This is true. But I think I'd phrase it more like \"one of the strong points of religion is that it rather often can help people deal with failure.\" Because it sometimes helps, and that's when religion is beautiful.\n \n But religion can sometimes hurt as well. Some forms of religion can cultivate crippling levels of guilt and shame in their believers. I have seen Christians call themselves \"worthless sinners,\" for example. That's simply not healthy. Imperfect is hardly equivalent to worthless.\n \n I tend to think that religion is like any other human phenomenon: it's got its good points, it's got its bad points. Too often, people see only the good and ignore the bad, or only the bad and ignore the good. The reality of religion is more complex than that.\n \n \nThe bottom line is, religion no more sets people up for failure than setting any sort of goals that will often not be met. ...

If a goal were automatically going to be met, it wouldn't need to be set in the first place! The possibility of failure is an intrinsic part of what it means for a goal to be a goal.",

   "But religion adds a further multitute of rules that we are certain to break. \n\n \n This, combined with your first post, seems to indicate that you believe religion is an addition, an additional complication, to an already complex secular process of child rearing. As I hope my post #6 showed you, the religion of humanism/evolution can do that too. The strictness of how a child is raised can set one up for failure, and that applies to strictness of humanism as well. \n \n The word ~strict~ is the key word - setting a child up for failure can happen with a strict application of any worldview. I believe it's common for children to be raised in a non-strict Christian home. (I was) Not one of \"indoctrine\", but one of a common sense application of Christian rules - one that shows an overall benefit from them in the long run. Conversly, it's of course possible for a child to be raised in a strict, yet non religious home. I think a child would be set up for failure if it were raised in a strict way by the authors of the Humanist Manifesto that I linked above. \n \n \nBut religion can sometimes hurt as well.
