Why would any nation not involved with supporting Israel or creating destabilization in the ME and exchanging profitable trade with Iraq even consider going along with our scheme to invade Iraq?

   "[QUOTE=montalban]\n Are you in the military? I'd be interested to know if you'd light the fuse then.\n No, I'm not in the military. I'd light the fuse by arming the Iranian dissidents. The young Iranians are fed up with being oppressed by the Fundamentalists in Iran and population demographics show that the vast majority of Iranians are under 30 and pro-Western.\n \n\n So, you know how the Sarin got there? Where's your evidence? I was merely speculating, whereas you are concluding.\n\n Read this if you doubt that it was home grown.\n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4997808/\n \n\n Oh, please. Who put that \"Madman\" in power, kept him fed and supplied him with WMDs? Selective memory on your part.\n\n Read the above article and you'll see that Iraq was quite adept of making their own WMDs.\n \n\n Yes, those terrorists in Northern Iraq were there, but Colon Powell didn't say that the US were protecting them, so it made for a half-truth.\n\n That's a bit of a stretch. We protected the entire Northern Iraq from genocide and a small band of terrorists is located in the North, therefore WE were protecting them? Get real.\n \n\n How did your father save Australia? I am not aware of who he is. Perhaps he was grossly ignored.\n Prove it. Making a just-so statement as a fact is interesting, but doesn't add to its truth.\n\n \n http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/events/wwii-pac/coralsea/coralsea.htm\n http://www.mm.wa.gov.au/Museum/mhist/sub/ww2.html\n As I stated before, my father was a sailor on an LRMR which was engaged in the battle of Iwo Jima and other naval battles late in the war. If it wasn't for the American fleet, Australia would have been devastated.\n Here's an excerpt from one site:\n \"American resources were indeed slim. When MacArthur arrived in Australia in March 1942, he found, to his dismay, that he had little to command. Australian militia and a few thousand U.S. airmen and service troops were his only resources. The Australian 7th Division soon returned from North Africa, where it had been fighting the Germans, and two U.S. National Guard divisions, the 32d and the 41st, arrived in April and May. MacArthur had enough planes for two bomber squadrons and six fighter squadrons. With only these forces, he set out to take Papua, while Admiral Nimitz, with forces almost equally slim, attacked Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands.\"\n http://www.worldwariihistory.info/WWII/turning-point.html \n \n Is that enough proof for you or would you like more?\n \n\n I am not against America. I certainly am against the US government. And look what happens. The moment a good ally of the US disagrees, you threaten them, and re-write history and make it out so that they're against the whole nation. Sounds like a school-bully\n\n Sounds like an angry friend who's buddy refused to watch his back to me. The term ingrate comes to mind.\n \n\n Anyway, your argument is akin to me saying that without the Soviets, you'd be speaking German now - as they bore the brunt of WWII and thus you should have been bending over backwards to say thanks to Russia.\n\n \n I suggest that you brush up on your WWII history. Russia didn't save the US. We were never attacked by Germany. Not one German landed on US soil. The closest that they came were U-boats off the Eastern Coast. And Russia joined the Allies against Japan just before Japan surrendered to the Allied Forces. They played NO PART in the South Pacific Theater at all.\n \n\n What's a quater-back? You whole language is couched in terms of the US being normative - I don't have a 'mom'. My mum wasn't born during WWII, but after, though what that has to do with anything - please explain. You've ranted a whole lot there, I imagine there was a point there somewhere.\n\n Does the term \"we saved your bacon\" ring a bell? How about \"we saved your a$$es\"?\n \n\n What about Puerto Rico? Or the Philippines? What about all the nations you've interfered with? From the democratically elected government of Allende in Chile, to Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Iran, Iraq etc. You're always doing it, and the US can, because it has loony red-necks yeah-haws that start spouting jingos the minute this is brought up.\n \n If you're through with the flag-waving and jingoistic sprays then we can get back to having a conversation in English.\n\n \n You talk about American lingo, what's a jingo? And I'd admit that the US' foreign policy has been schizophrenic in the past. Unfortunately, we occasinally have a Democratic President. \n emoticon_mad",

   "Am I seeing this right? There is no difference between America and a dictatorship? Any differences are illusions? Wow.\n \n The sky is truly falling in your world isn't it?\n \n I contend the US has been and remains a force for good in the world. None of the problems you list above are intractable and we have, in fact, faced and survived a lot worse ones.\n\n \n A limited dictatorship in that most representative power has been passed to the executive branch so our reps don't have to take local heat, disagree and you're unpatriotic, in which the public has very little say about anything. Actually I'm well insulated from the day-to-day irritations that place a majority of people under the thumb of our government policies and social demands, so I find it easy to point out the limits of representation created by two very similar political parties, one or the other controlling our present and future directions. Give some money to both and you can always find out what's actually happening. Give enough and you can establish a degree of personal and professional control dependent on the sum. With a dictatorship it's only one payment. I've always noticed that younger people, especially many who are starting or raising families, need a positive attitude to get them through what's becoming, in spite of being told how things are improving, a tough economy. Negative observations become detractions from the narrow focus necessary to cope with reality in those circumstances and I do understand positions condoning our changed form of government. I honestly don't believe most individuals who entered society as adults after the Gulf War comprehend the changes our government has undergone with regard to foreign policy and the effects those changes have had on civil rights. To have enjoyed freedom in the US (and foreign travel as a US citizen when the dollar was so strong you could buy small villages as travel mementos) during our economic reign before Russia upset the ME applecart and we decided to become more dominant than behind the scenes control (at one time or another we've lavishly supported every bad guy over there, including Saddam and Bin Laden, to keep it self-contained) was a real freedom and a lot less expensive. \n \n I'm remembering the 'good old days', of US freedom, where we were satisfied with openly disrupting just S. America, forever gone. The reality is now. I'm a fiscally conservative Republican who has little sympathy for loss of jobs, civilian contractors in Iraq, our obviously inept volunteer military regarding Iraq, Israel's Zionist policies, affirmative action, political correctness, social responsibility or the price of gasoline. I thought the invasion of Iraq was almost as dumb as Vietnam, and now I'm viewing it as even more stupid. Anyone who has lived within our past economy when things were very rosy and now can tell you we're facing serious economic problems without the Federal Reserve Chairman pointing out that we've far exceeded the danger point of deficit spending. I suggest that those who agree with our current direction of unilateral aggression, government expansion at record rates, deficit spending levels beginning to equal annual budget amounts, tax reduction in a time of declining revenues and cooked government financial reporting concentrate on amassing personal wealth outside equity markets or investment property. Regardless of the political administration holding office or congressional majorities, you're eventually going to need that or the mental ability to resign yourself to being on the lower tier of a two-tier society. Maybe at that point Americans will again take control of their politicians.",

I'm very familiar with Russia's involvement in the European Theater, but last time I checked, it was the Japanese kicking your butts in the South Pacific. The Russians didn't even declare war on Japan until after the US dropped the first atom bomb on Japan on August 6, 1945. Russia declared war on Japan on on August 9th, the day that the second atom bomb was dropped. japan sued for peace the following day. So, you see, Russia had NOTHING to do with the defeat of Japan.\n As for their part in beating the Germans, they unquestionably drew the majority of Germany's resources, but the US had nothing to thank the USSR for because it really wasn't OUR war. Our homeland wasn't saved by the Russians as yours was by the Allies, Dutch and Americans mostly.\n \n\n In fact, your whole notion is not akin to the United Nations, as the allies were to be known. You instead seem to think it was the rest of the world, and the USA! The USA undoubtedly contributed a large effort - but for you to imagine that you 'saved' the world, or 'Australia' is so arrogant, and belittles the efforts of every other nation.\n\n I suggest that you read up on your history. The bulk of the South Pacific naval duty fell on the American fleet. After a division of Australian soldiers were defeated in Singapore in 1942 and Darwin was attacked in March, all RAN ships were pulled from the Med and sent home to protect Australia. It was the US' defeat of the Japanese Navy in the Battle of Coral Sea that halted their advance towards Australia.\n Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, British and other soldiers fought many land battles along with the Americans, but it was the US Fleet that defeated the japanese at Midway and other naval encounters that prevented the Japanese fleet from reinforcing Japanese ground forces. \n It was also the US fleet that pounded the Hell out of Iwo Jima so that US Marines could take the island.\n \n\n The Chinese pinned down more Japanese divisions than the rest of the allies combined.\n\n I would hope so. They were fighting in CHINA.\n \n\n Likewise the Soviets did the same to the Russians.\n\n Ditto. they were fighting in Russia.\n \n\n Just in attacking \"The German Army High Command (Oberkommando des Heeres or OKH) assigned 148 divisions, including 19 panzer divisions, to the invasion of the USSR\"\n http://www.grolier.com/wwii/wwii_6.html\n \n They committed less than 50 to attacking the west, and throughout the war, even after D-Day, the bulk of German forces faced the Russians.\n \n It is people like you, ignorant, and stubbornly so, that annoy.\n \n Specifically, one of your web-sites deals with the Battle of the Coral Sea. This was an attempt to attack Port Moreseby in New Guinea, not Australia. Your sea forces were strategically victorious. However, the attack towards Port Moresby switched to a land attack, and it was here Australian forces committed, beat the Japanese.\n\n You're forgetting some important facts. Not letting Japan take Port Moresby was critical because if the Japanese could establish an airbase there, northeastern Australia could be targeted and the possibility existed that Australia would be taken out of the war. \n http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/events/wwii-pac/coralsea/coralsea.htm\n \n\n That is, it was an allied effort. It is such a shame that you keep thinkin of these things in terms of the USA and everyone else.\n\n Who destroyed the bulk of the Japanese navy? Who dopped the two atomic bombs that ended the war? It wasn't Australia, was it?\n Who decimated Germany's ability to wage war with massive bombing campaigns deep into the heart of Germany? Who liberated France, Italy, Poland, etc.,? Was it Australia? No, the bulk of Australian soldiers were pulled in 1942 to protect Australia from the Japanese.\n \n\n As I say, you're prepared to deal in terms of jingos, and if that's your frame of reference, so be it.\n \n The USA came into the war, not to aid Great Britian, whom your own ambassador to that nation gave only a few weeks to survive, you entered the war, when you were attacked.\n\n Are you familiar with \"Lend-lease\"? The US provided England with much needed munitions and other armament well before entering into the war. Many Americans didn't think that it was our fight since NO American territory had been attacked. We know now that it was a bad position, not unlike yours, I might add, but hindsight is 20/20.\n \n\n But your notions go back a long way. Typically during WWII, if the US had a victory, MacArthur had reporters report it as \"US Victory\", if we had a victory, MacArthur had reporters say \"US & Allied Victory\"*\n \n We entered the war, when Poland was attacked, that is, when Australia faced no immediate danger.

Hey, when are you going to write a post saying thanks to the Chinese and Russians for saving your butt?\n\n Give me a break. The US placated the likes of Montgomery and others on more than one occasion when it was the US carrying the weight. As for Australia entering the war before the US, Australia, as a member of the Commonwealth, along with Canada, New Zealand, India, Rhodesia and others, were obligated to do so as part of the treaty that you signed, IIRC. We had no \"dog in the fight\", so to speak, but we still helped out anyway. \n \n\n As to terrorists in northern Iraq, you miss the point.

   "JPSartre12, you claim (dubiously) to have a knowledge of history. Aside from this you have a lack of strategy.\n \n Whilst acknowledging China and Russia's efforts (in their own theatres), you fail to appreciate that these contributed in total to the Allied war effort.\n \n Yes, the US fleet was the Japanese fleets main enemy, but that is such a parochial outlook... it ignores the global picture - Japan was involved on many fronts as was Germany\n \n The bulk of their war-effort was in China, as Germany's was in Russia.\n \n Isolating one theatre and just looking at it is creating a false dichotomy. It's akin to me saying that Tito saved Greece from total annihilation because 'within the Balkans' he bore far more of the war effort than say did the United States. Such an outlook would only work if limiting the war through such false constructs. Or, the Brits saved your arse in the Burma campaign as they had more troops there than you did. The list of false dichotomies can go on.\n \n As I said, I have admitted the US war-effort. In global terms, that of the Soviets was perhaps greater. You should, therefore, thank the Soviets for saving your arse.\n \n You also believe that the US intended to save Australia, whereas it was the US effort to save the US...\n \n The US was quite happy too, when it suited them, let Australia be invaded. You should do some research before you make such jingoistic claims again... specifically when the war in the Pacific broke* many of our ground forces were engaged against the Germans in North Africa. Our Prime Minister, John Curtin, ordered them back to defend Australia, and Churchill with President F D R tried to divert them away to defend Burma. They were prepared to let Australia be invaded, because in global terms, they saw the supply link to China as more important (incidentally, because China was carrying out the bulk of the war effort against Japan).\n \n \"President Roosevelt was also bringing pressure to bear. Parliament met twice in secret session. The last straw was Churchill ordering the 7th Division to turn north for Burma, but he had to give way after no fewer than four staunch Australian protests.\"\n http://john.curtin.edu.au/resources/biography/details.html\n \n \"But Churchill wanted to use the Australians to reinforce Burma against Japanese attack. \n \n He took an extraordinary decision.\n \n On 20 February 1942, Churchill unilaterally ordered the convoy carrying the Australian troops to change course and steam north to Burma. He then tried to intimidate Curtin into agreeing:\n ?.... . I am quite sure that if you refuse to allow your troops to stop this gap. . . a very grave effect will be produced upon the President and the Washington circle on who you are so largely dependent. . . We must have an answer immediately.? \n \n (Churchill to Curtin ? 20 Feb 1942, ?Docs in Foreign Policy?, p.546-47.\n \n VOICEOVER \n Churchill did not tell Curtin that he had already diverted the convoy. Roosevelt backed Churchill in a cable to Curtin.\n \" I want to ask you in the interest of our whole war effort. . . if you will? order the division now en route to Australia to move with all speed to support the British forces fighting in Burma???\n http://www.abc.net.au/100years/EP5_3.htm\n \n Dr Edwards disputes this.

   "A limited dictatorship in that most representative power has been passed to the executive branch so our reps don&#8217;t have to take local heat, disagree and you&#8217;re unpatriotic, in which the public has very little say about anything. Actually I'm well insulated from the day-to-day irritations that place a majority of people under the thumb of our government policies and social demands, so I find it easy to point out the limits of representation created by two very similar political parties, one or the other controlling our present and future directions. Give some money to both and you can always find out what&#8217;s actually happening. Give enough and you can establish a degree of personal and professional control dependent on the sum. With a dictatorship it&#8217;s only one payment. I&#8217;ve always noticed that younger people, especially many who are starting or raising families, need a positive attitude to get them through what&#8217;s becoming, in spite of being told how things are improving, a tough economy. Negative observations become detractions from the narrow focus necessary to cope with reality in those circumstances and I do understand positions condoning our changed form of government. \n\n \n This sound familiar. Like, \"the judicial branch has no authority to interfere with the operations of the executive branch in matters of national security\". I am seeing a pattern here. It appears you are seeing the same pattern.\n \n \nI honestly don&#8217;t believe most individuals who entered society as adults after the Gulf War comprehend the changes our government has undergone with regard to foreign policy and the effects those changes have had on civil rights. To have enjoyed freedom in the US (and foreign travel as a US citizen when the dollar was so strong you could buy small villages as travel mementos) during our economic reign before Russia upset the ME applecart and we decided to become more dominant than behind the scenes control (at one time or another we&#8217;ve lavishly supported every bad guy over there, including Saddam and Bin Laden, to keep it self-contained) was a real freedom and a lot less expensive. \n \n \n These were the good old days, when you could travel through Africa, part of asia, and the ME for a month on $800, and live like a king. A fistfull of greenbacks was beter than a wheelbarrow full of gold. You could wander around buying up pricelss treasures to decorate your den with for $20 or $30 per pop, and if it got to where you had too much to carry, you could buy small children to carry it for you. People treated you well becasue you were an American.\n \n Contrast this to today. I am preparing for a trip to the middle east and a couple of spots in Africa. I plan to travel on a South African passport to aviod the hostility that has become common towards Americans. Everybody wants Euros or coin of the realm now. Irecently spoke to an associate who ahs just returned form traveling abroad, and he says he couldn't even pay his hotel bill in dollars. This is sad. At one tiem, a few dollars in the right direction would land you your own FLOOR in a hotel in Africa. NOw you can;t even get a room with them. \n \n \nI&#8217;m remembering the &#8216;good old days&#8217;, of US freedom, where we were satisfied with openly disrupting just S. America, forever gone. The reality is now. I&#8217;m a fiscally conservative Republican who has little sympathy for loss of jobs, civilian contractors in Iraq, our obviously inept volunteer military regarding Iraq, Israel&#8217;s Zionist policies, affirmative action, political correctness, social responsibility or the price of gasoline. I thought the invasion of Iraq was almost as dumb as Vietnam, and now I&#8217;m viewing it as even more stupid. Anyone who has lived within our past economy when things were very rosy and now can tell you we&#8217;re facing serious economic problems without the Federal Reserve Chairman pointing out that we&#8217;ve far exceeded the danger point of deficit spending. I suggest that those who agree with our current direction of unilateral aggression, government expansion at record rates, deficit spending levels beginning to equal annual budget amounts, tax reduction in a time of declining revenues and cooked government financial reporting concentrate on amassing personal wealth outside equity markets or investment property. Regardless of the political administration holding office or congressional majorities, you&#8217;re eventually going to need that or the mental ability to resign yourself to being on the lower tier of a two-tier society. Maybe at that point Americans will again take control of their politicians.\n\n \n And all this took place a little bit at a time. A bit here, and a bit there, a compromise with these folks and a few concessions to those guys in the corner. And people wonder why some become passionate about seemingly trivial things. At the same time, it seems there has been a general \"dumbifiction\" of the American people. They watch the news, they see a press release, and they go \"well, it must all be OK\". I thinkthere were several times in our coutries history where people ctually paid attention and were smart enough to see when they were being lied to. At one time, cooked numbers woudl not have passed muster when it comes to the economy. My grandfather actually understood what relation to the economy the GNP had, many people today do not. And it is IMPORTANT. \n \n I understand what has happened, but have trouble understanding exactly how it came to pass. \n \n BTW----Real value investments are definatly the place to hide your nest egg right now. We have lost over 80% of our foreign investment in our stock market int he last few years. This is not a good sign. Right now our market is being driven by \"feel good\" investing. The problem with feel good investing is that when people start feeling not so great, the market tumbles.",

   "JPSartre12, you claim (dubiously) to have a knowledge of history. Aside from this you have a lack of strategy.\n \n Whilst acknowledging China and Russia's efforts (in their own theatres), you fail to appreciate that these contributed in total to the Allied war effort.\n\n You're the one that keeps wanting to expand the discussion to include \"the World\". My comments were about the US saving Australia from being decimated by the Japanese. Yes, there were many fronts to the war, but there was only one Australia and it was the US Fleet that defeated the Japanese fleet at Coral Sea, Midway and others that stopped the southward trek of Japan and prevented them rolling in and teaching you how to speak Japanese as a FIRST language.\n \n\n Yes, the US fleet was the Japanese fleets main enemy, but that is such a parochial outlook... it ignores the global picture - Japan was involved on many fronts as was Germany\n \n The bulk of their war-effort was in China, as Germany's was in Russia.\n\n And the bulk of China and Russia's efforts took place on THEIR OWN SOIL. Russia and China were protecting their homelands, not others' homelands. They declared war on Japan on the day that Japan sued for peace. Russia only agreed to declare war on Japan in return for some land concessions AFTER the war was all but over. Some help there, huh?\n \n\n Isolating one theatre and just looking at it is creating a false dichotomy. It's akin to me saying that Tito saved Greece from total annihilation because 'within the Balkans' he bore far more of the war effort than say did the United States. Such an outlook would only work if limiting the war through such false constructs. Or, the Brits saved your arse in the Burma campaign as they had more troops there than you did. The list of false dichotomies can go on.\n \n As I said, I have admitted the US war-effort. In global terms, that of the Soviets was perhaps greater. You should, therefore, thank the Soviets for saving your arse.\n\n \n Again, Russia wasn't saving My arse. We didn't have a dog in the fight. We fought FOR others. Hitler wasn't attacking the US; he was conquering Europe.\n \n\n You also believe that the US intended to save Australia, whereas it was the US effort to save the US...\n \n The US was quite happy too, when it suited them, let Australia be invaded. You should do some research before you make such jingoistic claims again... specifically when the war in the Pacific broke* many of our ground forces were engaged against the Germans in North Africa. Our Prime Minister, John Curtin, ordered them back to defend Australia, and Churchill with President F D R tried to divert them away to defend Burma. They were prepared to let Australia be invaded, because in global terms, they saw the supply link to China as more important (incidentally, because China was carrying out the bulk of the war effort against Japan).\n \n \"President Roosevelt was also bringing pressure to bear. Parliament met twice in secret session. The last straw was Churchill ordering the 7th Division to turn north for Burma, but he had to give way after no fewer than four staunch Australian protests.\"\n http://john.curtin.edu.au/resources/biography/details.html\n \n \"But Churchill wanted to use the Australians to reinforce Burma against Japanese attack. \n \n He took an extraordinary decision.\n \n On 20 February 1942, Churchill unilaterally ordered the convoy carrying the Australian troops to change course and steam north to Burma. He then tried to intimidate Curtin into agreeing:\n ?.... . I am quite sure that if you refuse to allow your troops to stop this gap. . . a very grave effect will be produced upon the President and the Washington circle on who you are so largely dependent. . . We must have an answer immediately.? \n \n (Churchill to Curtin ? 20 Feb 1942, ?Docs in Foreign Policy?, p.546-47.\n \n VOICEOVER \n Churchill did not tell Curtin that he had already diverted the convoy. Roosevelt backed Churchill in a cable to Curtin.\n \" I want to ask you in the interest of our whole war effort. . . if you will? order the division now en route to Australia to move with all speed to support the British forces fighting in Burma???\n http://www.abc.net.au/100years/EP5_3.htm\n \n Dr Edwards disputes this. He says Curtin's defiance of Churchill  and Franklin Roosevelt in insisting that Australian troops be brought home from the Middle East rather than sent to Burma was a defining moment in Curtin's leadership.\n http://www.fpp.co.uk/online/01/04/SMH190401.html (this article is critical of the former Australian PM, Menzies).\n \n \n Make no doubt about it, the US served US interests. They did just happen, sometimes, to benefit us. As I said, your view of history is couched in jingoistic terms... not reality. Cartoon viewpoints don't stand up.\n\n \n So our dropping the atom bombs on Japan and swiftly ending the war \"might\" have benefitted Australia too? After all, imagine the number of Australians that would have lost their lives if an invasion of Japan had been necessary. Estimates ranged into the millions of casualties and undoubtedly, Australia would have suffered a heavy toll from such an action....so, you're welcome.:) \n \n\n PS\n that definition for 'jingo' was from a US web-site.\n \n \n *I use this term to suit your limited-view - as the war had been going on since the 1930s.\n\n And Australia joined the effort in what 1941, less than a year before the US did?\n \n\n This is from a documentary on those years... It shows that even when we wanted US friendship, it was viewed incorrectly\n \n \n Australia looks to America free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom ?we shall exert all our energies towards the shaping of a plan, with the United States as its keystone which will give to our country some confidence to be able to hold out.?

I've seen too many retrospectives on WWII, including a host of them postulating that our use of the A-bomb was unwarranted. I say, tell that to the hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers who were gathering in the Pacific, poised to invade Japan in 1945......my father amongst them.\n :xcensored",

I don't think I have heard it before. I would agree that this seems to be the case, but still can't help but wonder when americans went from a bunch of independant minded people to a bunh of gullible bafoons. \n \n I am surprised that your economic views don't get more debate here. I read a thread here a while back where at least a hlaf dozen people were hopping up and down and claiming that the US has the best economy in the world. Personally, I think the greatest deception in regards to our economy is the one about a sevice based aconomy being a great idea. IF you are not creating value (manufacturing, etc....) then you are just trading money around. Theoretically, we could all stop working, keep trading our money amongst ourselves with the same frquency and in similar amounts to what we do now, and our economy would remain relatively unchanged. This is what led to the eventual economic collapse of the Roman Empire. They relied heavily on slave labor, leaving the citizens of rome largely without work or the possibilty of work. They were running a \"service based economy\" amongst themselves, doing each others laundry and selling their kids as prostitutes, to keep some sembelance of an economy moving.

What will be interesting is if our administration continues to let the dollar drop in their efforts to polish GDP numbers and OPEC does decide to accept the Euro as payment to diversify their investment portfolios, evaporating with the dollar and helping oil climb in price.\n\n \n Nail on the head with that one. Are you an economist? If not, you missed your calling. It is realtively simple for a handful of large institutional traders to manipulate the market in whatever direction they desire, and of course up is better than down. I personally have doubts about whether the current administration has time to reverse the trends here. There are times that I wonder if we are not spiraling uncontrollably. I do know that there are a hdfull of indicators I have personally alays used as an indicator of which way the dollar is going to go. They have never been wrong before, and looking at my indicaors, it looks like the dollar has not bottomed out yet. Maybe I will find that they are wrong. I would be pleasantly surprised if this was the case. One of the indicators I have always found to be reliable was the scrap metal market. I realsie that it has become more lucrative because of the chinese, but even adjusting for that, scrap is up, which has always (in my experience) meant the dollar wil be dropping. If the dollar does not bottom out and begin climbing again, I am afraid that the Arabs will start taking payment in euros (who wants to be paid in momopoly money??). In that even, I personally believe that recovering without first seeing the equivelent of another great depression (only probably worse) is pretty thin.\n \n \n \n \nYour comment on the dollar being out of favor in hard currency nations is interesting. A friend who has employees traveling outside the US on a frequent basis dreads getting the American Express bill and watching exchange rates make hash of their travel budget projections.\n\n \n Again, who wants to be paid in monopoly money? To the best of my recolection, the dollar was always preferred currency througout the world. You could walk up to anybody and they would take your dollars. Now the dollar seems to have some competition in the Euro, and seems to be loosing favor. It makes me wonder how long before the local quickie mart starts accepting Euros as payment. \n \n I can sympathise with your buddy. I send people overseas fairly regularly, and those bills are killers. Realistically, it is very difficult to budget such things when your currency is dropping like a rock. If the $250,000 you budgeted for te year is suddenly only worth $200,000 in the real world, you are going to have a hell of a time making it up.

The 10% who pay the bulk of taxes are there because they, or their advisors, are on top of actual economic conditions. A majority of the remainder use highly polished government numbers as their oracle because their interest is immediate, i.e. 401k status, food on the table, gasoline, etc. Few people understand that just because the GDP is up it doesn't mean anything on a future basis when dominant numbers driving it are consumer and government spending based on debt. As you point out, the same dollars can only be churned so many times as taxes take a bite from each transaction (that's all GDP is, transactions) and without a positive balance of trade no new money, wealth, is entering the system. \n \n A couple of people I correspond with and myself are guessing that the subject of this thread, WMD, and the associated costs will eventually be a critical turning point in our fiscal demise. When all of those costs, military, domestic security, adverse economic conditions created by that buzzword in most industries, declining tax revenue due to those conditions and the associated federal deficits are added up, it will prove to be our most expensive war ever. The social costs of maintaining control over a mostly compliant society under those conditions are beginning to appear at local levels with big, big federal issues right around the corner.",

If one considers our all-volunteer military with college educations included at federal expense used in an aggressive manner, not for pure defense, that would be considered creation of government jobs, including the seemingly masses of civilian contractors used to keep military numbers static, by anyone not defending our foreign policy. Any child, even if he/she can barely read and write, is federally entitled to a college education based on economic status of being below a stated asset/income level. Any mother who bears a child who is incapable of or doesn't desire to support herself is immediately qualified for aid to dependent children, food stamps, housing allowance and full medical care. Under federal law, no hospital can deny emergency medical service to any individual.

   "JP, we're about as close to being socialists at the federal level as a country can get without declaring same. If one considers our all-volunteer military with college educations included at federal expense used in an aggressive manner, not for pure defense, that would be considered creation of government jobs, including the seemingly masses of civilian contractors used to keep military numbers static, by anyone not defending our foreign policy. Any child, even if he/she can barely read and write, is federally entitled to a college education based on economic status of being below a stated asset/income level. Any mother who bears a child who is incapable of or doesn't desire to support herself is immediately qualified for aid to dependent children, food stamps, housing allowance and full medical care. Under federal law, no hospital can deny emergency medical service to any individual. By displaying a lack of assets or income, any individual receives virtually any medical treatment free under state managed programs mostly funded by Medicare.

Iraq is one large \"social\" program being levied on the US taxpayer. Bush's prescription drug plan and the Iraq war will both cost the taxpayers billions of dollars, however the war will also cost many Americans their lives. The one advantage to the drug plan, like other social plans here at home, is that taxpayer money pumped into these programs goes to Americans and it's spent in America. Here is a link to a website that posts a running \"cost\" of the war that can even be broken down by states. By the way, why are you so resistant to help \"needy\" Americans, yet so gung ho about saving Iraq? I realize there are abuses in our programs, but if they're going to waste my money, at least give it to people that will spend it here at home! \n \n http://costofwar.com/",

Foreign investors have and are deserting our equity markets for that very reason. We get the construction money, jobs and operating expenses, quickly chewed up by repeated transactions with taxes eventually making them zero. It becomes a hand to mouth existence if no profits stay here for reinvestment. In all the cases I'm familiar with, states and counties desperate to polish their employment numbers virtually give away the tax base and infrastructure, putting that on the backs of the newly employed workers. Isolationism in the form of tarrifs and quotas may look good on paper, but the US consumer pays for all of those polished numbers with higher prices and a static income (unless one is a typical government employee with juicy COLA and merit increases), a double hit.\n \n IMO, due to our righteous moral stance and the influence of Christianity, we're not capable of colonialism, regardless of how we label it. Those morals, our belief system, our ignorance and rejection of foreign history and customs will never let us dominate a country for our own purposes. That's why we're failing in Iraq. WWII is an excellent example, as were the actions of past conquering empires. The proven formula is to trample them into the ground with force and not let them back up until they do your bidding. Many of our past and present military leaders told our administration it would take a force equal to what Saddam employed, 400,000 troops, to effectively secure Iraq. Instead, they listened to exiled Iraqis, many who hadn't even lived in Iraq for 20+ years and believed we would be welcomed with open arms because that's what they wanted to believe to express their power.\n \n China? We couldn't beat those numbers in a ground war from Korea, Vietnam or anywhere else without a general draft and mobilizing the country on a war footing, which the public would never accept except as a defensive measure true to our constitution. FDR found that out. Selective drafts and volunteer armies don't include primary breadwinners and other established voters (other than those poor National Guard suckers) with something to lose. Truman and Nixon were both faced with the use of nucs to win such a war. Truman certainly wasn't afraid to use them to save American lives, but he and Nixon were both wise enough to know that would be the end of the world as we know it. By 1953 and especially by 1973, lots of people had them including China and, if attacked, wouldn't hesitate using them if and when their backs were up against the wall. There will never be another invasion of China or Russia after their experiences with Japan and Germany during the WWII era. Either one would take the world down with them.",

They are the ones who must make the hard choices of cutting out governmental handouts, free medicine and free medical care for everyone. They're also the ones who will have to get a handle on runaway Social Security spending and unaccountable Defense Department expenditures. \n I believe that I heard Bush is looking for a $2.4 Trillion budget for the next fiscal year. That's unacceptable, IMO. We need a Congress and Executive that are able to make tough choices in order to bring our fiscal house back in order. I don't see GW being that person.......but I think Kerry would be even worse, driving us even farther into debt with MORE social programs. And, as long as Special Interest groups, like the AARP, the UAW, the AFL-CIO, the NEA, the NAACP, etc., etc., keep protecting liberalism and demonizing Conservativism, we'll never have a Congress with the backbone to act appropriately. JUst look what happened to the 1994 Republican Congress. They took control promising to cut spending and get the deficit under control.
