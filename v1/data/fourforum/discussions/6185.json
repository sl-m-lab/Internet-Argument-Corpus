   "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/14/international/europe/14abortion.html\n \n Antiabortion Effort in Europe, With U.S. Money, Widens Its Conservative Agenda\n By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL\n Published: August 14, 2005\n WARSAW - For most of July, pedestrians in Lodz found themselves face to face with 14 grisly billboards pairing images of aborted fetuses with photographs of blood-spattered bodies - victims of genocide in Srebrenica and Rwanda, or toddlers killed in the Oklahoma City bombing. \n \n Placed by a Polish antiabortion group, the traveling exhibition, which moved on to Lublin, exemplifies an aggressive, well-financed and growing conservative movement across Europe that opposes not only abortion but often other things related to sex, like sex education, contraception and artificial insemination. \n \n Encouraged by the Roman Catholic Church, enabled by the election of conservative governments in many countries and financed in part by antiabortion groups in the United States, the conservative push has made powerful inroads in countries where policies guaranteeing a wide range of reproductive services had been long entrenched. \n \n While only Ireland, Portugal, Malta and Poland have placed strict legal limits on abortion, many countries are considering new limits on the practice, or are restricting payment for abortion and contraception by national health plans. \n \n As in the United States, access to abortions is also increasingly stigmatized, and doctors are increasing unwilling - or afraid - to perform them. \n \n In Croatia, the procedure was free 10 years ago but now costs more than the average monthly salary. Croatian schools now use a sex education program called Teen Star that promotes abstinence and teaches that birth control pills are dangerous and that condoms do not protect against disease.\n \n When liberal politicians proposed a measure supporting assisted fertility, Catholic bishops blocked it, saying such technology \"brings to life children who are things and not human beings, usually severely damaged,\" said Sanja Cesar, head of the Center for Education, Counseling and Research in Bratislava, Slovakia. \n \n In Italy, the Catholic Church has used its weight to support conservative politicians who passed a restrictive fertility law that bans, among other things, egg donations for stem cell research. \n \n In the Netherlands, the new Christian Democratic secretary of health has suggested a review of that country's liberal abortion law. \n \n Anna Zaborska of Slovakia, the new chairwoman of the European Parliament Committee for Women's Rights and Gender Equality, opposes abortion. \n \n Nowhere is the change more evident than here in Poland, where abortion was free - and freely accessible - under Communism. A relatively restrictive abortion law was passed in 1993 (it refers to the fetus as a \"conceived child\") and a strong social stigma has since emerged, along with an antiabortion stance among doctors' groups. The result: only 174 legal abortions were performed nationwide in 2004. \n \n Recently the country's leading gynecology journal refused to publish the World Health Organization's guidelines on \"Safe Practices in Abortion,\" calling them \"reprehensible.\" \n \n \"Abortion is not safe, because a patient who undergoes such treatment always dies,\" wrote Andrzej Barcz, editor of the journal, Practical Medicine-Obstetrics and Gynecology. The push comes from several directions. \n \n Women's groups in Europe contend that antiabortion positions have been promoted by otherwise mainstream politicians with debts to pay. In Poland, the Solidarity movement, which overthrew decades of Communist rule in 1989, received financial and moral support from the Catholic Church when it was still illegal under Communism. \n \n Rebecca Gomperts, founder of the Dutch abortion rights group Women on Waves, said the change has been particularly evident in \"two to three years, as more Christian Democrat and conservative governments have come to power.\" \n \n In countries like France and Italy, youth groups are now lecturing in schools and organizing marches, promoting abstinence and an antiabortion message. Mr. Meaney said that was due, in part, to the \"John Paul II effect,\" adding that the pope, who was noted for his strong connection with young people, had strongly opposed abortion and contraception.\n \n The Roman Catholic Church has been particularly influential in former East Bloc countries, where it made rapid gains after Communism collapsed more than a decade ago. \n \n Croatia and Slovakia, for example, signed treaties with the Vatican that give the church influence over school curriculums, including sex education.\n \n (Continued)",

   "Perhaps not least significant, antiabortion groups in the United States are increasingly traveling to Europe to help train local activists. \"They bring money, leaflets and little plastic embryos,\" said Olga Pietruchova, director of Prochoice Slovakia. \n \n Human Life International, a Virginia-based antiabortion group,  has an office for Eastern Europe in Gdansk, Poland, and has sent missions to more than a dozen European countries in the past five years, providing money and seminars on how to fight abortion. \"There are now a lot of pro-life groups working in Europe, but they are fairly young, formed in the last five or 10 years,\" said Joseph Meaney, the group's international director.\n  \n \n Such activity has caught the attention of some European Union officials. In 2003, Poul Nielsen, then the European commissioner for overseas development, warned member states about the aggressive European activities of American antiabortion groups, saying their ultimate goal was \"no contraception at all, and sex within marriage only.\"\n \n Europe also has much homegrown activity. In Croatia, where 86 percent of the population is Catholic, the national bishops conference has joined with other church groups to demand that Parliament ban abortion. \n \n Many opponents to the trend say that the European antiabortion advocates have been emboldened by global political trends, like the Bush administration's decision to promote abstinence as the preferred form of birth control. \n \n \"Those who oppose woman's choice have become stronger and louder because the international atmosphere supports them,\" said Esmerelda Kuliesyte of Lithuania, who leads the Family Planning and Sexual Health Association in Vilnius.\n \n In Poland, the law permits abortion if the woman's health is in danger, or if genetic defects have been detected in the fetus. But some abortion rights advocates contend that, in practice, it is very hard to get an abortion. Wanda Nowicka, head of the Federation for Woman and Family Planning in Warsaw, said, \"there is now almost no condition that would allow you to get an abortion here.\" \n \n Her group is bringing a lawsuit on behalf of a woman who is nearly blind because doctors refused to allow her to abort when she fell ill during pregnancy.\n ",

Religion and faith play a role in the abortion issue. The pro-choice movement is propelled by the religion of secular humanism (generally speaking although there might be some exceptions). Secular humanism preaches that there is no god, and even if there were one could not know it (an argument that is rooted in blind faith), and that everything came about by chance. Therefore it would follow that mankind is nothing more then an abnormal wart on the face of a chance universe who has no purpose or dignity whatsoever - everything is meaningless (I still have not figured out why these meaningless people post meaningless words on a meaningless internet forum). This religion and all the sects that branch off from it, has no basis to place any dignity in the human being whatsoever. And since in general people form their beliefs partly from religion, there is no question that religious beliefs is the driving force for the pro-choice argument. It may not be politically correct to say this as it may be taken as one group forcing their religious beliefs on others, hence most pro-choicers wont even touch the religious aspect with a ten foot pole.\n \n Now, what I can't for the life of me understand is why anyone would choose to listen to those who have no basis for placing dignity in the human being try to make a call on issues of ethics and morality. It makes sense that those who, due to their chosen faith based religion, can find no basis for the sacredness of human life would have a problem comprehending a view that says that human life is sacred and all people should be treated with dignity and respect.",

   "Oooh, the pweshious widdo fetus and fertilized egg!\n \n People are dying right now in New Orleans--babies, old people, sick people, they are either dying or living in abject misery because they had the misfortune to be poor.\n \n The devil! I am going to preach a little sermon:\n \n I cannot tell how much I hate it that I, an Atheist, must preach to Christians about the word of Christ. \n \n We have now a crisis of enormous human misery in the City of New Orleans and surrounding regions. Therefore, unwashed and unholy Christian brethren and sistern, I tell you to turn to Chapter 25 of Matthew (hmm, was he the tax collector guy? Anyway, that's beside the point.) \n \n Let us, therefore, begin with Verse 31 of Chapter 25 of the Taxman's (if that's what he was) journal: \n \n When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him (I hasten to say that Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, etc., will NOT be amongst these angels), then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory. \n \n And before him shall be gathered all the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from his goats (Dear Sistern and Brethren, where, oh, where will the United States of America be? I ask you, are we sheep or goats?). \n \n And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left (I must remind you, dear brethern and sistern, that in the context of the ancient Middle East, the left hand was the unclean hand owing to the dreadful dearth of adequate sanitary facilities in those days for washing one's hands after one has done certain processes of elimination from one's body, therefore, for reasons of sanitation and health it was necessary for the right hand to be reserved for putting food into one's body and not contaminating it and to reserve the left hand for taking care of business when the food was processed and eliminated, being on the left hand, even the left hand of Christ--hmm, it seems to me that someone ought to write something about the \"Left Hand of Christ.\" Any volunteers?). \n \n Then shall the King (I suppose that at this time, one may presume that the term \"King\" refers to Christ himself.) say to them on his right hand (The Clean and Righteous Hand, remember.), Come, ye blessed of my Father (OK, Altari, that clears up my earlier concern in to the identity of the \"King,\" unless there is a chance that this reference is to the Holy Ghost.), inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. \n \n (Now, dear Sistern and Brethren, this is the crux of the matter, please pay close attention:) \n \n For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: (Dear Brethren and Sistern, give heed to those in New Orleans who have no meat) I was thirsty and ye gave me drink: (Remember also, dear Sistern and Brethren, that those in New Orleans are very thirsty and it is NOT for the word of God that you wish to ram down their throasts--they are thirsty for pure and simple H2O--I hope that is not too much science for you) I was a stranger and you took me in: (Yes, Brethren and Sistern, there are many in the City of New Orleans who are strangers and have no place to go) \n \n Naked, and ye clothed me: (No, dear Sistern and Brethren, these people of New Orleans are not precisely naked but their clothing is fouled with days and days of sweat and excrement and urine from the circumstances of their living conditions--they need badly a bath and a new suit of clothes.) I was sick, and ye visited me: (Dear Brethren and Sistern, we have before us the abandoned sick of a certain Charity Hospital in the City of New Orleans who are there because they did not have insurance and access to regular healthcare--those wealthier souls with health insurance and money have already been taken out to safety--but those souls in Charity Hospital, these people who are, in his own words, Christ himself, have been abandoned.) I was in prison, and ye came unto me (Instead, we see a callous condemnation of those who have transgressed the law by looting for survival and fail to remember, that ugly as they are, they bear the Face of Christ upon their countenance and ye have judged them). \n \n I think, that owing to space limitations, I must continue my sermon in another post.",

   "Dear Sistern and Brethren, pray bring your Bibles back up and refer again to Chapter 25 of the Taxman's journal, we are now at Verse 37, pay attention and see how you must answer: \n \n Then shall the righteous answer him, (Remember, dear Brethren and Sistern, these are the righteous sheep on the righteous and clean right hand of the King, they are not the goats on the unrighteous and unclean left hand of the King--and I will not reiterate my history notes on certain practices of that time) saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungred and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? \n \n When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? \n \n Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? \n \n And the King shall answer and say unto them, (Dear Sistern and Brethren, this is it, this is the message of the King) \n \n Verily I say unto you (This is the plural form of the familiar ye, ye Brethren and Sistern, be honored that the King is addressing ye in the familar form), \n \n Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. \n \n Thus endeth the lesson, let these words be branded upon your soul that ye may answer with righteousness when ye are summoned before the throne of the king--and these are the words of a Liberal King, not a radical rightwing wingnut. (OK, I had to inject a political note in this sermon but, demn it, I'm right!!!)\n \n Oh yeah, and you fetalists who are fixated on the pweshious widdo fetuses, fertilized eggs, etc., I do not believe that the statement: \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me,\" refers to pweshious widdo fetuses and fertilized eggs, etc.",
