   "Current events which are taking place in the Middle East are pushing me at some idea that Jews wish to create kind of 'Great Israeli State'. It could be delirium but the fact of Israel zeal to realizing military operation in Lebanon and its support to US on Iran proves it. Moreover Israel enlisted the GB support too!\n The fact is that not long ago Americans declined SC UN resolution about cease-fire in Lebanon but now GB is showing its discontent about document prepared by EU about 'immediate cease-fire'! And as a result of in they got compromises in 'soon cease-fire'! Well? I think that Americans and British are trying to give one more chance to Israel to full military operation conclusion with attainment of all aims which will take some week's time. What is it? Two great counties are defending furiously the interests of Israel, no they defend alien interests not their own! \n To all appearances Jews are trying to get more than security of own country! They are trying to press Muslims world and Middle East by Americans and British' hands. And as a result of it they hope to create new Israel, in new boarders which will be unconditional leader in the district!",
