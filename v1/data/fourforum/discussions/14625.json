   "SAN BRUNO, Calif. - As many as six people were still missing in the wreckage of the natural gas explosion that ripped through this hillside community earlier this week, officials said Sunday, after a day of conflicting reports from the authorities over how many people had perished. \n \n Remains that could have been human were found at two spots in the wreckage on Saturday .... Four people have been confirmed dead, although the authorities said that, given the number of people believed to be missing, the death toll from the explosion caused by the ruptured 30-inch diameter gas main could rise. On Sunday, San Bruno city officials raised the number of missing to six, from five. \n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/us/12fire.html\n \n But, dear Americans, you know in your black little hearts that PROFIT is far more important:\n \nPacific Gas & Electric enjoys a near monopoly over 70,000 square miles of Northern and Central California, with 15 million customers. \n \n The California Public Utilities Commission allows the company to charge rates 30 percent higher than the national average. As a regulated utility, the publicly traded company's shareholders benefit from a guaranteed 11.35 percent return on equity, which is also above the industry average of about 10.5 percent.\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/us/19bcpge.html\n \n You faint-hearted liberals, stop whining about possible human remains. You and your crummy ideas about Social Justice!",

   "There would be an issue if Pacific Gas & Electric had some frugal policies that caused these deaths, but you're just attacking the company because they're big, and some of their employees died in an accident. Your threads are getting more and more trivial. I thought a veteran of almost 7,000 posts would be able to make a point.",
