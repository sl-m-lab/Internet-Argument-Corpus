   "New York City Council - Speaker Quinn, Council Members and Administration Announce Tougher Penalties on Toy Gun Sales\n \n \nCity Hall &#8211; Speaker Christine C Quinn, together with Council Member Al Vann, today announced legislation that would increase penalties for selling a toy gun by 500 percent. The legislation would also enhance the Department of Consumer Affairs&#8217; enforcement ability and allow the agency to shut stores that are repeat offenders of the law. Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) Commissioner Jonathan Mintz and Criminal Justice Coordinator John Feinblatt joined the Speaker and Council Members at the announcement. The officials also announced a new citywide public awareness campaign about the dangers of toy guns that look real and real guns that look like toys.\n \n &#8220;Despite the fact that New York City&#8217;s toy and imitation gun law has been in existence for several years many merchants continue to sell items that resemble real guns,&#8221; said Council Speaker Quinn. &#8220;Our communities are at risk when they cannot tell a fake toy gun from a real one and the dangers these items present are all too real. Children have been hurt and even killed as a result of these guns being out in our communities.&#8221;\n \n The City Council&#8217;s Consumer Affairs Committee will hold a hearing on the legislation this afternoon. The proposed bill would increase the fine for a first violation from $1,000 to up to $5,000. It would also increase the fines for subsequent violations within a two year period from $3,000 to up to $8,000. Finally, it would also permit DCA to seal, for up to five days, the premises of a store found guilty of three or more violations within a two year period.\n \n Current law imposes a fine of up to $1,000 but does not increase that amount for subsequent violations. Since 2002, DCA has removed more than 7,200 imitation guns from the shelves of nearly 240 stores throughout the city and levied $2.4 million in fines.\n \n Today, the City also announced a new subway advertising campaign, to be displayed in 2,100 subway cars, all 468 subway stations and more than 5,400 buses. The campaign warns New Yorkers of the dangers of realistic-looking toy guns and the dangers of real guns that are painted to look like toys. The campaign&#8217;s advertisements demonstrate potential confusion about gun coloration and warn people that it is illegal either to make a fake gun look real or make a real gun look like a toy. New Yorkers are encouraged to call 311 about either problem. Calls to 311 that concern real guns that look fake will be forwarded to the Police Department&#8217;s Gun Stop hotline. Callers can receive a $1,000 reward for information that leads to a conviction and can remain anonymous. The City has received a grant from the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services to support the ad campaign.\n \n &#8220;Gun violence is plaguing the Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights neighborhoods that I represent, as well as communities across the city and country,&#8221; said Council Member Al Vann, prime sponsor of the bill. &#8220;When I introduced this legislation, my intentions were also to stem the glorification of guns within our communities, and push the businesses that we patronize to be responsible members of our neighborhoods. I will continue working to address gun violence and its underlying issues. In light of the senseless shooting that occurred in my district Sunday night, it is apparent that we must work more diligently to stem the violence that is afflicting our neighborhoods.&#8221;\n \n &#8220;There is little debate that realistic-looking toy guns pose a serious threat to the safety and welfare of police officers and New Yorkers as a whole,&#8221; stated Deputy Majority Leader Leroy Comrie. &#8220;Sadly, violence resulting from toy guns has happened too many times in this city. This bill is a common sense solution to a very serious threat to our safety.&#8221;\n \n &#8220;Toy guns that look real and real guns that look like toys threaten the safety of our dedicated police officers and our children, especially during this holiday season,&#8221; said Criminal Justice Coordinator John Feinblatt. &#8220;This public awareness campaign will help to educate the public about the dangers posed by these guns.&#8221; \n \n &#8220;Imitation firearms that look real are not party items to be wrapped up and given as gifts during the holiday season, and they&#8217;re certainly not toys,&#8221; said Consumer Affairs Commissioner Jonathan Mintz. &#8220;DCA appreciates the Council&#8217;s strong and unequivocal message to the City&#8217;s retailers who must do right by their customers and their communities by keeping these dangerous items off their shelves forever.&#8221;\n \n &#8220;With the holiday season in full swing, it is particularly important to bring attention to the fact that toy guns can cause accidents resulting in serious injury or death,&#8221; said Council Member Maria del Carmen Arroyo, Co-Chair of the Black, Latino and Asian Caucus. &#8220;Time and time again our communities are at risk and at serious danger when someone carries what is perceived to be a fake gun. I want to thank the Speaker and the Administration for strengthening the penalties in hopes that repeat offenders cease to sell improper toy guns.&#8221; \n \n &#8220;Last month an there was an unfortunate incident in my district where a young teen was shot by police because they mistook his toy gun for a fake one,&#8221; said Council Member Larry Seabrook. &#8220;We need to hold these toy gun sellers accountable for selling such a heinous product. Our children&#8217;s lives are at stake. It is my hope that these penalties will finally deter stores from selling these toys. Our communities need to work together. I ask when they see someone selling bad toy guns or when they see someone concealing a real gun for a fake one to call 311.&#8221;\n \n &#8220;This legislation will help prevent further violence by deterring businesses from selling toy guns that look real,&#8221; said Council Member Melissa Mark-Viverito. &#8220;The increased regulations created by this bill will not only prevent toy guns from being used to commit crimes, but also will avert children from being wounded or killed by confused police officers who mistake their toy for a real gun.&#8221;\n \n &#8220;Harlem Mothers S.A.V.E. fully supports the action to increase penalties for store owners who are repeat offenders of the law and we agree that the city should have the authority to shut down such establishments and prevent their further endangering lives of our children and safety of community, said Jackie Rowe Adams, Co-founder. \n \n Under New York City&#8217;s Public Safety Law, it is against the law to sell or offer to sell any toy or imitation firearm that can reasonably be perceived to be an actual firearm unless the exterior surface of the toy or imitation firearm is predominantly brightly colored. The range of acceptable colors includes white, bright red, bright orange, bright yellow, bright green, bright blue, bright pink or bright purple.\n\n \n The desperate flailings of a city with absolutely no common sense. They're so impotent in their abilities to get tough on criminals, they feel it necessary to go after the most unrelated sources to try and make themselves look big and busy.\n \n Why not just build a big wall to cut itself off from the rest of the world, and set up high security check points so cars coming and going can be checked to ensure no contraband is being smuggled in.",

It's important for officers to remember that an untethered weapon (something tucked in a waistband, for example) can be brought on target with some modicum of accuracy in just one-quarter of a second. If that gun is already pointed at you, the suspect can pull the trigger in six-one-hundreths of a second. \n \n \"If you add to that the need for the officer to take even more time to stand there and try to visually spot clues that might indicate the weapon a suspect is brandishing is fake before firing, you are clearly putting that officer at alarmingly more risk. Even the slightest unnecessary delay can kill an officer. That's a risk I am not willing to take. \n \n \"If it looks like a gun, if it's pointed at you and if you have reason to believe that your life may be in immediate jeopardy, you need to respond with deadly force...quickly.\" \n Youth brandishing toy gun fatally shot by Ark. officer\n\n \n In reguards to the sport of airsoft do you believe that it should be banned due to the real looking appearance of the \"guns\"?\n \n IIf a police officer shoots a kid or adult holding a fake gun who cares?

   "Remember all the sh## about the laser pointers when they started becoming available several years ago?\n \n This is kinda off track but not really though.\n \n Law Enforcement Alliance Of America.  \n \n \n Laser-Aiming Devices: Targeting the Misuse\n \n They&#8217;re fun and exciting &#8220;toys&#8221; for many consumers these days, although lasers were much more elusive and out-of-reach just a decade ago when we merely knew them as a staple in the sci-fi superhero&#8217;s arsenal. Actually, laser devices are rather -common now; you can buy them practically anywhere. Teachers and business professionals use them for instructional purposes, while police officers and soldiers still use them for target acquisition. And this is usually the context in which cops perceive laser-aiming devices.\n \n Therefore, when an officer is performing a traffic stop in a dark, seedy part of town and the vehicle is brimming with rowdy, uncooperative adolescents, and the officer suddenly sees a floating red dot nearby, a swift response is often justified.\n \n In a split-second, how is an officer suppose to determine the source of the red dot? Is it a reckless kid who means no harm with his newfound toy? Or is it a parolee who&#8217;s just been stopped in a stolen car who&#8217;s now pointing his laser-equipped pistol at the approaching officer&#8217;s center-mass?\n \n It&#8217;s time citizens realize the threat that these technological devices pose to law enforcement officers, and it&#8217;s time for lawmakers to handle the matter wisely &#8212; but not with irrational, knee-jerk solutions, as they&#8217;ve been known to do.\n \n The Laser Safety Act\n \n The discussion surrounding the threat of laser-aiming devices heated up in January 1999 when Calibre Press sent an electronic newsletter to their 50,000+ police-only subscribers detailing the murder of a Chicago police officer; the killer was equipped with a laser-sighted firearm. Calibre Press, a well-known publisher/distributor of -officer-survival material, appropriately stated that this officer&#8217;s death &#8220;serves as a grim reminder that red laser dots should, for good reason, cause police officers serious concern.&#8221;\n \n Then Calibre Press&#8217;s lead instructor and expert witness Dave Grossi explained that &#8220;just like with toy guns, if an officer -reasonably believes that someone has acquired him as a target with a laser-sighted gun, and is facing a life-threatening situation, deadly force could be justified under certain circumstances.&#8221;\n \n Seeing the need for a thoughtful and -useful remedy, LEAA took the pro-active position of drafting the &#8220;Laser Safety Act,&#8221; and forwarding this late-breaking development to Calibre Press who subsequently -notified their 50,000 subscribers that LEAA was on the cutting edge of this issue, directing them to LEAA&#8217;s home page for more details. The response was simply phenomenal. More than 100 inquiries were received in the first few weeks from cops wanting to know more. And countless others were able to download all the details and the model legislation from our home page. One officer from Upstate New York summed it saying, &#8220;Your legislation is the perfect answer. I also like it because it does not interfere in any way with the legitimate use of laser pointers.&#8221;\n \n This officer hit the nail on the head, and quickly recognized LEAA&#8217;s motivation in -getting involved in the issue.\n \n In keeping with LEAA&#8217;s agenda of punishing the criminal misuse of a tool, rather than the tool itself, LEAA replicated our approach to firearms by developing legislation that doesn&#8217;t target the lawful ownership and use of laser pointers; rather it punishes the -criminal misuse. After all, it takes a person to commit a criminal act, not a laser pointer, or a knife or gun or any other inanimate object. LEAA also wanted to thwart the attempts of misguided politicians and administrators who would like to restrict our freedoms and ban possession of lasers (much like they intend to do with firearms). Additionally, our legislation reflects the serious repercussions of pointing a laser at a police officer and -heightens the public&#8217;s awareness.\n \n Specifically, the Laser Safety Act makes it a felony to direct lasers at police officers. Further, the Laser Safety Act mandates punishment for those who harass or intimidate a law enforcement officer with a laser.\n \n Success Thus Far\n \n Now that lawmakers are beginning to -realize how the misuse of laser devices is causing concern among law enforcement officers, many are rushing to pass some ill-conceived measures at the city and state level. LEAA wants to meet this need by circulating our bill with the hopes of getting the Laser Safety Act adopted in all 50 states, and in Congress.\n \n In its first year, LEAA&#8217;s Laser Safety Act has already been signed into law in Louisiana, and similar legislation has been enacted in Washington and Tennessee. Then we got a huge break. In December, the Laser Safety Act was adopted as &#8220;model legislation&#8221; by the American Legislative Exchange Council, an organization of conservative -legislators X both Democrats and Republi-cans X operating on the principle that government and private industry should work as partners to solve the problems facing our country. ALEC&#8217;s support of this bill will be instrumental in exposing this level-headed solution to lawmakers from every state.\n \n Momentum is also catching on in city governments as many towns have passed some good and not-so-good ordinances. In February 1999, a far-reaching misdemeanor law went into effect in New York City that prohibits the sale of, or offer to sell, a laser pointer to anyone under 18 and prohibits anyone under 18 from possessing one in public. This law also dictates that sales displays of lasers may not be accessible to buyers in an unsupervised location without the assistance of a sales person, and makes it unlawful for anyone to project a laser into or through a public place.\n \n On the federal level, we&#8217;ve been in search of a congressional sponsor. LEAA&#8217;s legislative team recently notified the 75 members of the Law Enforcement Congressional Caucus about our model legislation and shared with them the concerns surrounding the misuse of lasers. Shortly thereafter, the calls began pouring in with congressmen expressing interest.\n \n Unfortunately, officers are finding themselves in precarious situations either with criminals purposely dotting officers or seemingly innocent citizens just doing it for kicks. With this type of legislation gaining popularity, LEAA wants to be on the front-end guiding lawmakers in the right direction by punishing the criminal misuse of a tool, not condemning the tool itself. After all, it&#8217;s not right to penalize the vast majority of law-abiding citizens who own and responsibly use lasers everyday, no more than it would be right to restrict all motorists because a few choose to drink and drive, or encumber all gun owners because criminals endanger others with firearms.\n \n # # #\n Seems the problem was forgotten about,or it could be it was just a laser\"sight\" and not a gun toy or not.\n \n Just a thought.emoticon_hbemoticon_confusedFor a buck buy one at almost any store.",

   "I felt like this was relevant to the discussion.\n \n University of Colorado places ban on Nerf guns - Washington Times\n \n \nDENVER | It was a rough week for gun rights in Colorado.\n \n First, Colorado State University voted to ban concealed firearms on campus.\n \n Then the University of Colorado went a few steps further and cracked down on another nefarious threat: Nerf guns.\n \n Plans for a student-led game of humans vs. zombies took a hit after campus security officials discovered that players intended to use the popular orange-and-green toy weaponry. Simulated guns, even those that shoot spongy Nerf balls, are banned at the University of Colorado.\n \n The game, a national craze on college campuses, involves \"zombie\" students attempting to eliminate \"human\" students by pelting them with Nerf balls or socks. Once a \"human\" has been tagged, he becomes a zombie and must wear a bandana around his head.\n \n Humans can stun zombies for 15 minutes by tagging them with a Nerf ball or sock. Zombies must hit at least one human every 48 hours or \"starve.\" The game ends when all the humans have been turned into zombies or all the zombies have starved, which can take days.\n \n CU spokesman Bronson Hilliard said students cooperated fully, replacing the Nerf guns with balled-up socks and even taking it upon themselves to hang fliers in dormitories warning players to leave their Nerfs at home. The game started Dec. 1 and ended a couple of days later.\n \n Still, it didn't take long for cries of \"liberal killjoys\" to ring out across the Internet. The contrast was especially stark given the headlines that week at Colorado State University, thought to be the last college outside Utah that allowed students to carry concealed weapons on campus with a permit.\n \n The CSU Board of Governors voted unanimously Dec. 4 to ban concealed weapons over the objections of students. Presidents of the Colorado State system have until February to submit a weapons plan that complies with the new policy.\n \n At CU, the ban on Nerf guns isn't new. University officials pointed out that the Board of Regents banned simulated weapons from campus years ago, rather than just in time to suck the fun out of last week's game. \n \n \"No guns of any kind, real or toy, from air rifles to paintball guns to Nerf guns, are allowed on campus under the laws of the regents,\" said a statement issued by Joe E. Roy, chief of police at the University of Colorado Police Department. \"We are simply enforcing a longstanding policy, not inventing a new category of enforcement.\"\n \n The debate over Nerf guns isn't limited to Boulder. Since Humans vs. Zombies first began at Goucher College in Towson, Md., in 2005, colleges have wrestled with whether to allow students to pack Nerf heat. Opposition intensified after the deadly 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech.\n \n Chief Roy noted that Nerf guns can look real to passers-by at a distance. Two years ago, Alfred University in upstate New York went on a two-hour lockdown after a faculty member reported a student carrying a weapon that turned out to be a Nerf gun.\n \n That's even more likely now that some Nerf heat-packers are painting their plastic weapons to look like the real thing. Mr. Hilliard pointed to a Web site that advocates painting Nerf guns black in order to achieve that authentic look.\n \n \"We love Nerf guns as much as the next adult adolescent male. But there comes a day in all of our lives when we realize that you can't scare the hell out of anyone with a bright orange and pink pistol shooting foam darts,\" says the Gizmodo Web site under the heading \"Realistic Nerf Weaponry Combines Laser Sights with the Color of Death.\"\n \n At Bowling Green State University in Ohio, administrators banned the use of Nerf guns for a semester, but then met with student organizers and drew up a list of guidelines, such as keeping the game outside of school buildings. Students also agreed to refer to the weapons as Nerf \"blasters,\" not guns.\n \n The next semester, the Nerf ban was lifted, said Landon King, a junior and past president of the BG Undead, which organizes the games.\n \n \"We haven't had any issues, other than people coming up and asking, 'What's that?' \" said Mr. King, who added that the group always coordinates its games with campus police. \"My only advice for the University of Colorado would be to work with the university, listen to their concerns, and meet them halfway.\"\n \n In the meantime, Colorado zombies were content to adhere to the no-Nerf policy, especially after learning that they could be charged with violations of the student-conduct policy or even arrested on charges of unlawful conduct.\n \n \"We told them that the violation of the weapons policy is a serious thing,\" said Mr. Hilliard. \"If a third party happened upon this and called 911, we'd have to respond as if it were a real incident.\"\n \n That was enough to convince students like junior Trevor Doner.\n \n \"It's not worth it,\" Mr. Doner told the Colorado Daily. \"I'm just going to shed my dignity and bring a balled-up sock to chemistry class.\"\n\n \n So it would seem that nerf guns, things made out of brightly colored neon plastics and constructed in an absolutely unrealistic fashion, something that looks like this, is somehow too realistic to be allowed on school grounds. Apparently some people are so stupid, they might think that a neon yellow, six barreled pistol might actually be a real gun capable of fire real bullets.\n \n First it's New York City, wanting to fine toy stores for selling what they call \"realistic looking toy guns\" and now we have schools like Colorado State University, proclaiming that brightly colored toys are just too real looking to be allowed on campuses; especially after Virginia Tech.\n \n I have to ask. Just where the **** is the common sense?",
