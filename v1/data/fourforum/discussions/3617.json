   "http://207.44.245.159/article7201.htm\n \n \n QUOTE \n Al-Jazeera aired only four minutes of Osama bin Laden's videotape released last week, this is the transcript for the full 18 minutes. Watch the video of his remarks\n \n Following is the full English transcript of Usama bin Ladin's speech in a videotape sent to Aljazeera.\n \n 11/01/04 \"Aljazeera\"\n \n Praise be to Allah who created the creation for his worship and commanded them to be just and permitted the wronged one to retaliate against the oppressor in kind. To proceed:\n \n Peace be upon he who follows the guidance: People of America this talk of mine is for you and concerns the ideal way to prevent another Manhattan, and deals with the war and its causes and results. \n \n Before I begin, I say to you that security is an indispensable pillar of human life and that free men do not forfeit their security, contrary to Bush's claim that we hate freedom. If so, then let him explain to us why we don't strike for example &#8211; Sweden? And we know that freedom-haters don't possess defiant spirits like those of the 19 &#8211; may Allah have mercy on them.\n \n No, we fight because we are free men who don't sleep under oppression. We want to restore freedom to our nation, just as you lay waste to our nation. So shall we lay waste to yours. \n \n No-one except a dumb thief plays with the security of others and then makes himself believe he will be secure. Whereas thinking people, when disaster strikes, make it their priority to look for its causes, in order to prevent it happening again. \n \n But I am amazed at you. Even though we are in the fourth year after the events of September 11th, Bush is still engaged in distortion, deception and hiding from you the real causes. And thus, the reasons are still there for a repeat of what occurred. \n \n So I shall talk to you about the story behind those events and shall tell you truthfully about the moments in which the decision was taken, for you to consider. \n \n I say to you, Allah knows that it had never occurred to us to strike the towers. But after it became unbearable and we witnessed the oppression and tyranny of the American/Israeli coalition against our people in Palestine and Lebanon, it came to my mind. \n \n The events that affected my soul in a direct way started in 1982 when America permitted the Israelis to invade Lebanon and the American Sixth Fleet helped them in that. This bombardment began and many were killed and injured and others were terrorized and displaced. \n \n I couldn't forget those moving scenes, blood and severed limbs, women and children sprawled everywhere. Houses destroyed along with their occupants and high rises demolished over their residents, rockets raining down on our home without mercy. \n \n The situation was like a crocodile meeting a helpless child, powerless except for his screams. Does the crocodile understand a conversation that doesn't include a weapon? And the whole world saw and heard but it didn't respond. \n \n In those difficult moments many hard-to-describe ideas bubbled in my soul, but in the end they produced an intense feeling of rejection of tyranny, and gave birth to a strong resolve to punish the oppressors.\n \n And as I looked at those demolished towers in Lebanon, it entered my mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind and that we should destroy towers in America in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children.\n \n And that day, it was confirmed to me that oppression and the intentional killing of innocent women and children is a deliberate American policy. Destruction is freedom and democracy, while resistance is terrorism and intolerance.\n \n This means the oppressing and embargoing to death of millions as Bush Sr. did in Iraq in the greatest mass slaughter of children mankind has ever known, and it means the throwing of millions of pounds of bombs and explosives at millions of children &#8211; also in Iraq &#8211; as Bush Jr. Did, in order to remove an old agent and replace him with a new puppet to assist in the pilfering of Iraq's oil and other outrages.\n \n So with these images and their like as their background, the events of September 11th came as a reply to those great wrongs, should a man be blamed for defending his sanctuary? \n \n Is defending oneself and punishing the aggressor in kind, objectionable terrorism? If it is such, then it is unavoidable for us. \n \n This is the message which I sought to communicate to you in word and deed, repeatedly, for years before September 11th. \n \n And you can read this, if you wish, in my interview with Scott in Time Magazine in 1996, or with Peter Arnett on CNN in 1997, or my meeting with John Weiner in 1998. \n \n You can observe it practically, if you wish, in Kenya and Tanzania and in Aden. And you can read it in my interview with Abdul Bari Atwan, as well as my interviews with Robert Fisk. \n \n The latter is one of your compatriots and co-religionists and I consider him to be neutral. So are the pretenders of freedom at The White House and the channels controlled by them able to run an interview with him? So that he may relay to the American people what he has understood from us to be the reasons for our fight against you? \n \n If you were to avoid these reasons, you will have taken the correct path that will lead America to the security that it was in before September 11th. This concerned the causes of the war.\n \n As for it's results, they have been, by the grace of Allah, positive and enormous, and have, by all standards, exceeded all expectations. This is due to many factors, chief amongst them, that we have found it difficult to deal with the Bush administration in light of the resemblance it bears to the regimes in our countries, half of which are ruled by the military and the other half which are ruled by the sons of kings and presidents. \n \n Our experience with them is lengthy, and both types are replete with those who are characterized by pride, arrogance, greed and misappropriation of wealth. This resemblance began after the visits of Bush Sr. to the region. \n \n At a time when some of our compatriots were dazzled by America and hoping that these visits would have an effect on our countries, all of a sudden he was affected by those monarchies and military regimes, and became envious of their remaining decades in their positions, to embezzle the public wealth of the nation without supervision or accounting. \n \n So he took dictatorship and suppression of freedoms to his son and they named it the Patriot Act, under the pretense of fighting terrorism. In addition, Bush sanctioned the installing of sons as state governors, and didn't forget to import expertise in election fraud from the region's presidents to Florida to be made use of in moments of difficulty. \n \n All that we have mentioned has made it easy for us to provoke and bait this administration. All that we have to do is to send two Mujahideen to the furthest point East to raise a piece of cloth on which is written al-Qaida, in order to make the generals race there to cause America to suffer human, economic, and political losses without their achieving for it anything of note other than some benefits for their private companies. \n \n This is in addition to our having experience in using guerrilla warfare and the war of attrition to fight tyrannical superpowers, as we, alongside the Mujahideen, bled Russia for ten years, until it went bankrupt and was forced to withdraw in defeat.\n \n All Praise is due to Allah.\n \n So we are continuing this policy in bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy. Allah willing, and nothing is too great for Allah. \n \n That being said, those who say that al-Qaida has won against the administration in the White House or that the administration has lost in this war have not been precise, because when one scrutinizes the results, one cannot say that al-Qaida is the sole factor in achieving those spectacular gains. \n \n Rather, the policy of the White House that demands the opening of war fronts to keep busy their various corporations &#8211; whether they be working in the field of arms or oil or reconstruction &#8211; has helped al-Qaida to achieve these enormous results. \n \n And so it has appeared to some analysts and diplomats that the White House and us are playing as one team towards the economic goals of the United States, even if the intentions differ.\n \n And it was to these sorts of notions and their like that the British diplomat and others were referring in their lectures at the Royal Institute of International Affairs. (When they pointed out that) for example, al-Qaida spent $500 000 on the event, while America, in the incident and its aftermath, lost &#8211; according to the lowest estimate &#8211; more than 500 billion dollars. \n \n Meaning that every dollar of al-Qaida defeated a million dollars by the permission of Allah, besides the loss of a huge number of jobs.\n \n As for the size of the economic deficit, it has reached record astronomical numbers estimated to total more than a trillion dollars. \n \n And even more dangerous and bitter for America is that the Mujahideen recently forced Bush to resort to emergency funds to continue the fight in Afghanistan and Iraq, which is evidence of the success of the bleed -until-bankruptcy plan &#8211; with Allah's permission. \n \n It is true that this shows that al-Qaida has gained, but on the other hand, it shows that the Bush administration has also gained, something of which anyone who looks at the size of the contracts acquired by the shady Bush administration-linked mega-corporations, like Haliburton and its kind, will be convinced. And it all shows that the real loser is...you.\n \n It is the American people and their economy. And for the record, we had agreed with the Commander-General Muhammad Ataa, Allah have mercy on him, that all the operations should be carried out within twenty minutes, before Bush and his administration notice. \n \n It never occurred to us that the commander-in-chief of the American armed forces would abandon 50 000 of his citizens in the twin towers to face those great horrors alone, the time when they most needed him. \n \n But because it seemed to him that occupying himself by talking to the little girl about the goat and its butting was more important than occupying himself with the planes and their butting of the skyscrapers. We were given three times the period required to execute the operations &#8211; All Praise is Due to Allah.\n \n And it's no secret to you that the thinkers and perceptive ones from among the Americans warned Bush before the war and told him, \"All that you want for securing America and removing the weapons of mass destruction &#8211; assuming they exist &#8211; is available to you, and the nations of the world are with you in the inspections, and it is in the interest of America that it not be thrust into an unjustified war with an unknown outcome.\" \n \n But the darkness of the black gold blurred his vision and insight, and he gave priority to private interests over the public interests of America. \n \n So the war went ahead, the death toll rose, the American economy bled, and Bush became embroiled in the swamps of Iraq that threaten his future. He fits the saying, \"Like the naughty she-goat who used her hoof to dig up a knife from under the earth\"\n \n So I say to you, over 15 000 of our people have been killed and tens of thousands injured, while more than a thousand of you have been killed and more than 10 000 injured. And Bush's hands are stained with the blood of all those killed from both sides, all for the sake of oil and keeping their private companies in business. \n \n Be aware that it is the nation who punishes the weak man when he causes the killing of one of its citizens for money, while letting the powerful one get off, when he causes the killing of more than 1000 of its sons, also for money. \n \n And the same goes for your allies in Palestine. They terrorize the women and children, and kill and capture the men as they lie sleeping with their families on the mattresses, that you may recall that for every action, there is a reaction.\n \n Finally, it behooves you to reflect on the last wills and testaments of the thousands who left you on the 11th as they gestured in despair. They are important testaments, which should be studied and researched. \n \n Among the most important of what I read in them was some prose in their gestures before the collapse, where they say, \"How mistaken we were to have allowed the White House to implement its aggressive foreign policies against the weak without supervision.\" It is as if they were telling you, the people of America, \"Hold to account those who have caused us to be killed, and happy is he who learns from others' mistakes,\" And among that which I read in their gestures is a verse of poetry, \"Injustice chases its people, and how unhealthy the bed of tyranny.\"\n \n As has been said, \"An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.\"\n \n And know that, \"It is better to return to the truth than persist in error.\" And that the wise man doesn't squander his security, wealth and children for the sake of the liar in the White House.\n \n In conclusion, I tell you in truth, that your security is not in the hands of Kerry, nor Bush, nor al-Qaida.\n \n No.\n \n Your security is in your own hands. And every state that doesn't play with our security has automatically guaranteed its own security. \n \n And Allah is our Guardian and Helper, while you have no Guardian or Helper. All Peace be Upon he who follows the Guidance.\n \n Copyright: Aljazeera \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ...",

   "They oversimplified the meaning of \"ay wilaya\". While the translation is factually correct in so far as he is talking about the individual states, the meaning is not restri ted to merely American states. Russian states, chinese provinces, etc.. would be referred to the same. \"Ay Wilaya\" refers to a smaller division of a state (nation). In context, it would certainly seem that he is threatening the individual states.\n \n The big question would be, was he really looking to get Kerry elected, or looking to get Bush re-elected? This section seems to explain his strategy:\n \n \nAll that we have mentioned has made it easy for us to provoke and bait this administration. All that we have to do is to send two Mujahideen to the furthest point East to raise a piece of cloth on which is written al-Qaida, in order to make the generals race there to cause America to suffer human, economic, and political losses without their achieving for it anything of note other than some benefits for their private companies. \n \n This is in addition to our having experience in using guerrilla warfare and the war of attrition to fight tyrannical superpowers, as we, alongside the Mujahideen, bled Russia for ten years, until it went bankrupt and was forced to withdraw in defeat.\n\n \n Bush certainly seems to be falling for it. We have certainly suffered human, economic and political losses and have achieved nothing of note. In all the time that Bush has had to deal with the AQ threat, he as not manged to hurt AQ or Bin Laden significantly. AQ is bigger than ever, and has FAR more money to play with. It could be argued (and effectively so) that Bush is the best thing that ever happend to Bin Laden.\n \n Abd Al-Rahman Al-Rashed, director-general of Al-Arabiyya TV, wrote the following about kerry:\n \n \n\"The Palestinians are never satisfied with any president who leaves the White House - and a month later, they cry because of every new president, and acknowledge that his predecessor was not as bad as he. Kerry's plan for the future surpasses that of his rival Bush for pro-Israel bias. [Kerry] has a history of unquestioning support for Israel [throughout his term] in the Senate, in accordance with [the policy of the] Democratic Party, which is biased towards the Jewish State. We must not forget that Kerry, who leads the polls, also aspires to remain in the White House for eight years, and will inevitably try harder to please the Jews. \n \n \n Here is his statement on Bush:\n \n \n\"Regarding Bush, the truth is that he is the only president who publicly undertook to support the establishment of a Palestinian state ... and he is the only American president who undertook to recognize an independent Palestinian state. And perhaps he is [also] the only one who can do this in the next four years, [as he will be] less subject to pressure - as was done by his predecessor Bill Clinton, who gave the Palestinians the greatest hope they had ever had in their entire history to be liberated from the occupation. \n \n \n It seems to me that what they are after is a change in the ME policy of the United States. Bush was unwilling to change the policies, so it would seem that they felt a change was in order. I really don't beleive for even a second that they wanted kerry becuse they are afraid of Bush, especially not after everything he has done for them.\n \n I think that if you take a look at soem of the other literature and media coming out of the ME, neither Bush nor kerry was seem as a good canidate (at least not from their viewpoint) since they both had essentially the same gameplan for the war in Iraq and the war on terror.",

He wants the french and Germans to hate us, he wants Belguim to refuse to prosecute AQ members, he want Russia to refuse to back our plays in the Me.

Paid for, of course, by US workers loyal to US foreign policy. Do you feel the general US public will ever discover this is an economic war without a crash?

   "I really can't see bin laden threateneing individual states\n \n If this is true [that bin Laden meant individual U.S. states] then his whole statement makes no sense.\nSure it makes sense. If bin Laden can mention in his speech something so obscure as the pet goat story Bush was reading at the time of the 9/11 attack, then surely it's conceivable that bin Laden has some understanding of our electoral college system for electing the president.\n \n As you're no doubt aware, voters don't directly elect the president. Rather, they choose 538 electors, who in turn will cast the official votes for president and vice-president in December. What's especially notable is that the plurality winner of the popular vote for President within each state receives all of that state's electors, while the other candidates in that state receive none. (This model of 'winner take all' is slightly modified in Maine and Nebraska, but since neither state has ever split its electoral vote, practically speaking it still remains true that the plurality winner in each state receives all the electors.)\n \n Thus, when understood in the context of the U.S. Electoral College, bin Laden's statement is quite sensible, in my view.\n \n His speech opens with a direct address to his intended audience: \"People of America this talk of mine is for you...\" Then he proceeds to state his case against the re-election of George Bush.\n \n In his closing statement, note bin Laden's attempt to tilt a close election campaign toward Kerry's favor with intimidating threats to strike at any state that goes for Bush. He says in plain Arabic that our security is not in the hands of Bush, nor Kerry, nor even al-Qaida itself: \"No. Your security is in your own hands. And every state that doesn't play with our security has automatically guaranteed its own security.\"\n \n It doesn't get much plainer than that. It constitutes a warning to each and every state separately, that any state voting its electors for Bush will be considered an enemy, and any state voting against Bush will not be considered an enemy. It's a transparent attempt to drive a wedge among the American people, as if bin Laden was willing to treat one state different from another. Unfortunately for the forces of Islamic fascism, bin Laden's ploy failed to shake most of the American people, who in turn delivered a 2-3% shortfall to Kerry in the end.",

   "unkerpaulie, I agree that bin Laden was not impressed with Kerry, despite the preference of Kofi Annan and other world leaders for a Kerry victory. Bin Laden is no doubt aware that in matters of real consequence, Kerry is more aligned with Bush than with bin Laden's Islamist allies.\n \n \n \nbut the statement immediately before the one you mentioned is: \"In conclusion, I tell you in truth, that your security is not in the hands of Kerry, nor Bush, nor al-Qaida. No.\"\nYes, I'm aware of this statement. My message specifically took note of it as being the prelude to the statement that followed. That following statement of course is regarding how every state separately can guarantee its own security by not threatening the mujahedeen's security.\n \n \n \nit doesnt make the following statement a clear threat against bush-voting states.\nIt seems clear enough to me. Bin Laden specifically names the Bush dynasty as responsible for the deaths of millions of Muslims. I'm not clear why you don't consider this a threat against Bush-voting states.\n \n \n \nwhether you voted bush or kerry, it didnt make your state more secure from what i see\nThat may well be the case, since I don't imagine Kerry giving up the hunt for bin Laden. If your point is that bin Laden had no real preference for Kerry over Bush, that's certainly a possibility, since few people know for certain bin Laden's private views. Still, his statement did include a number of Democratic party talking points, some of which were used by Kerry himself. And Islamist web sites affiliated with al-Qaeda, like the internet forum Al-Qal'a, said the statement was a warning to individual U.S. states not to vote for Bush. \n \n But let's assume that bin Laden does not distinguish between Bush and Kerry, and that any state that votes for either Bush or Kerry will not have its security guaranteed. Then what was bin Laden's point in saying that each separate state was responsible for guaranteeing its own security?\n \n Was it an insincere ploy that meant no state would be immune from attack, regardless of how it voted? Or did bin Laden hope for a seismic electoral shift to the Arab-American candidate, Ralph Nader? What, in your view, was bin Laden's point?\n \n \n \nby pushing the notion that again these states are under constant threat, it gives our government a stronger case for beefing up homeland defense and military spending.\nI don't see anyone pushing the notion that some states are under constant threat while select states like California and New York that voted for Kerry are now deemed to be a lesser target for terrorism. Also, our govn't is not dependent on bin Laden's latest statement to build the case for homeland defense. Govn't officials have assumed for years that al-Qaeda would try again to strike the homeland. We don't need the occasional reminder from bin Laden that he means us harm, nor is there any indication his statement will affect homeland defense and military spending.\n \n Perhaps the content of the statement and the timing of its release was not an attempt to influence our election. Some people likewise believe that the Madrid train bombing days before the Spanish election was mere coincidence. My own view, however, is that the timing of both was deliberate with respect to each country's election. Earlier this year, bin Laden offered a truce to Europe, attempting to drive a wedge between the U.S. and our European allies. It's not hard to imagine he would attempt to drive a similar wedge among American voters.\n \n If one dismisses the notion that bin Laden sought to tip a close election out of Bush's favor, then one has to wonder what bin Laden alluded to when he said, \"every state that doesn't tamper with our security has automatically guaranteed its own security.\" What must any state do to guarantee its security?",

Which begs the question, do many people really believe that a simple vote for a president is going to have any bearing on the way terrorists view a society? \n\n \n I have to wonder if perhaps this wasn't Bin Ladens goal. Polls here certainly indicated that people placed the war on terrorism high on our list of priorities. I don't know that \"show of defiance\" is necessarily correct, but I do think that if people were led to believe that BL was afraid of Bush (and why else would he be calling for his removal from office), it could certainly influence the vote.\n \n It seems odd to me that BL would really want Bush out of office. As he noted in his speech, his ultimate goal is the destruction of America, and he plans to do it by bleeding our economy dry. Bush's go it alone attitude and take the fight to the enemy mentality certainly seems to be speeding us towards this goal to the tune of $7.4 million per hour.\n \n \nI'm interested to know what message the American public thinks has been sent to the world, with the re-election of Bush?\n\n \n That we actually think the same as that bafoon.

We have sent them the message, loud and clear, that we don't care what they think. We will blow up what we want, when we want, where we want, and the rest of the world can take a flying leap. \n \n Not sure that this is really the best message for a nation with a trillion dollar trade deficit and a faltering currency to make, but we can just show a picture of the American flag on TV and the american sheeple can be counted on to forget any economic facts they might have obatined over the years and with wide, glassy eyes proclaim in a zombie like monotone \"we don't need the rest of the world\" (which some will follow up with \"they report, you decide\").",

Which begs the question, do many people really believe that a simple vote for a president is going to have any bearing on the way terrorists view a society?\nIt's probably safe to say that defiance of terrorists was not the litmus test for why Bush was reelected. People cite a medley of reasons for why they voted for Bush... decisive leadership; moral compass; pro life; supreme court justice appointments; tax policy; strong defense; and so on.\n \n You're correct of course to question whether the terrorist view of society is affected by how that society votes. Consider the case of Spain, where the Madrid train bombings in March prompted a last-minute upset in Spain's national elections. The Spanish capitulation to terrorism was viewed by the jihadists as a terrorist victory in bullying a Western nation. Incoming PM Zapatero pledged to withdraw Spanish troops from Iraq, and he further declared: \"We're aligning ourselves with Kerry. Our alliance will be for peace, against war, no more deaths for oil.\" In reply, the al-Qaeda linked group that perpetrated the bombings called a truce in its Spanish operations to allow the new Madrid government to withdraw its troops from Iraq.\n \n So how was Spain rewarded for its capitulation and withdrawal of troops? Just three weeks ago-barely seven months after the train bombings killed nearly 200 people in Madrid-Spanish officials disclosed the interception of a Muslim terrorist plot to deal Spain the \"biggest blow of its history\", a suicide truck bomb aimed at blowing up the National Court and killing the country's top judges. Apparently the holy warriors of Islam aren't yet finished with Spain, despite that country's appeasement policy. \n \n \n \nI'm interested to know what message the American public thinks has been sent to the world, with the re-election of Bush?\nI don't think the people voting for Bush were overly concerned with sending a message to the world. Some here may have relished the Bush reelection with a view toward the criticism and contempt for him displayed in the foreign press, but I don't think it's a significant motivating factor.\n \n More relevant, and striking much closer at home, is the view of what message the American voter sent to our domestic elites, particularly the Hollywood crowd that embraced Michael Moore, as well as the corruptible elite media.",

   "Gator, just because the world leaders oppose bush doesnt mean they automatically favored kerry. bush invaded a foreign country and declared open war on false information and non-existent accusations. the world leaders cant be happy when the leader of a global superpower makes that kind of error. but it still doesnt mean they support the other guy, except that its the only way to get rid of bush\n \n as far as interpreting the speech as bin laden threatening specific republican states, i think that such an interpretation is a waste of time. the threat exists for all states as long as bin laden and his minions are alive. and for the states with big cities and dense populations, the fact that they went for kerry is no kind of guarantee that they are safer, regardless of what the speech means\n \nWas it an insincere ploy that meant no state would be immune from attack, regardless of how it voted? Or did bin Laden hope for a seismic electoral shift to the Arab-American candidate, Ralph Nader? What, in your view, was bin Laden's point?\n\n i dont think we should base our actions on whether bin laden was sincere or not. the only way to deal with bin laden is to kill him and entirely anihilate al qaeda. whether the entire country went for kerry or not, bin laden would have attacked the us. look at the other 95% of the message, bin laden talks about his hate for the us going all the way back to 1982. the person or party in power on 9/11 would not have changed bin laden's plan that had been in the works for 20 years. stopping the hunt for bin laden (which we have stopped since 2002) wont make america safer either.\n \n bin laden's point, in my view, is to rub in our faces the failure of this administration to impact his operations or his convictions. there was no way in my mind that the elections going one way or the other had anything to do with whether bin laden would plan to attack or not",
