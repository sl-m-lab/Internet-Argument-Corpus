I have a problem with teaching kids about people with certain genes, or people from certain cultures. Calling a man black, white, homosexual, straight; it's all utterly useless in 98% of the cases people do. Your skin color matters if you are being exposed to a lot of sun, your sexual orientation matters when you are in a sexual relationship.\n \n Neither of those things is particularly inspiring, leaving the only possible alternative that these attributes are mentioned on purpose despite their irrelevancy for the purpose of discrimination. Discrimination does not have to take the form of treating someone else as an inferior because of some irrelevant value, just treating them specially because of said irrelevant value is irrational and despicable. It is even worse to claim a man's achievements are a product of things beyond their control than it is to claim his failures are the same.\n \n You want bigoted children?

Nowhere do the words Seperation of church and state appear in the Constition. That phrase is in reference to a similiar phrase in a letter by Jefferson.\n \n I see why gays would want this, I just don't think there will be very much bang for the buck. While it at first glance portrays gays in a positive light, being contributors to great things, being around since recorded history and probably earlier, opens a dialogue that may lead to better understanding etc.\n The problem I see is many of the known gays who could be worthy are associated with the arts, music, literature, poetry, art and architecture to name a few. These don't make it into History books except as minor partial mentions in passing type stuff. Budget cuts have all but eliminated the classes geared towards these specifically. \n \n Next there will be a near impossible burden to prove a historical figure was gay. Prior to say the last 100 years or so if your were famous you didn't make it known. I bet anyone there will be at least a half dozen legal challenges to people who are porteayed as gay and that is after the legal challenges to even make the distinction.\n \n It creates a seperation of them and them and if there is a pattern of figures like artistic people guess who is going to have another geek stero type to get over.\n \n It's not that I think gays shouldn't be recognized as valuable members of our existance. I just think with the amount of money that this will cost, the results will not be worth it. I would much rather see money like this put into smaller classrooms, better teaching programs, classes that deal with social issues specifically instead of trying a sneak it in and maybe they won't notice approach. \n \n Smarter kids with hopeful futures are less likely to need a group to vent their frustration out on. When they can think logically and rationally they can make better choices and have a better chance or overcoming preconcieved ideas about others. They do not fear looking stupid in front of their peers or afraid to experince something different. \n \n 30 out of 500 pages spread out in a history book read over the course of 9 months isn't going to do any of these things.\n \n California is 2 - 4 billion in the hole, in 2009 we were the 8th largest economy in the world and 49th in education in the US and what is important is teaching kids some people were gay. \n \n Here is an idea how about teaching them they can't catch gay from a friend or not all gay people run around in a boa calling everyone darling. That gay people for the most part are not anywhere near as persistant if you tell them no as straight men are with women and changing in front of a gay person doesn't mean your gay also.\n \n That would be money well spent.",

Schools buy new books , when it's time for them to purchase new history books the new information will have already been added. Since they would eventually spend money on new books anyway I don't see this costing anything over and above what they already spend on new books.\n \n When the Texas School board decided to remove Thomas Jefferson from our history books No one complained it would cost too much money to change the books... \n \n Point is, this Law doesn't affect anyone in a Adverse way. It's not like they are opening new classes for teaching Gay History, in fact I doubt the teachers will teach any different . If this was costing anyone or affecting them in a harmful manner it would be different, but it's not so making a big deal out of it is pointless.\n\n \n The harm is not in not teaching about the roles of gay people in history nor is it highlighting their accomplishments. \n \n I would like to say it isn't about the money, but that only because it touches an emotional aspect of society. Images of starving children carrying tryas of food to greedy men who use $100 bills to light their cigars (I watched to much TV as a kid) but it is about the money. Because the people of this state have placed irresponsible unqualified people in a position to make choices for them and those people made bad decisions. Now the state and the country have no money.\n \n One state 8th largest economy in the world, 1.2 trillion dollars and we posses the 2nd dumbest kids in the Union. \n \n The US ranks 27th in Math testing skills and 22nd in Science The average ranked 17th.\n \n National IQ scores we are in a 9 way tie for 9th place. Iceland and Mongolia are tied for 5th. Sorry to any Icelandic or Mongolians. I hate Bjork though.\n \n But don't think we have no talent. Two years in row we were #2 in the world, representing 14.2% global consumption\n \n of Beer\n \n I don't want to repeat myself but my last post was pretty clear I think why I think there are better ways to achieve the same goal. Do you not remember what it was to be a 14 year old boy? I think this would have more impact if you piped in subliminal messages every other class. \n \n When a group of kids can make fun of each other saying the same vulgar joke to a straight friend or a gay friend your problem is 90% solved. Telling these kids someone they have never heard of and maybe can't even pronounce the name is gay and invented a widget will accomplish gays being called widgetmakers while getting beat up.",

Well I seriously doubt that since you shifted your post very quickly yet I'll play. If this is indeed about \"sex\" then the parents should teach their kids about copulation, STD/HIV/AIDS and proper protection.\n \n However I seriously doubt many religious parents would be open to discussing such topics which is why they put a check mark every year for the STATE to teach their kids about sex.\n \n You really have no say in what the state teaches at that point once you allow them to do so.

   "For the unenlightened (emphases mine):\nObjectivism is a philosophy defined by the Russian-American philosopher and novelist Ayn Rand (1905-1982). Objectivism holds that reality exists independent of consciousness, that human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception, that one can attain objective knowledge from perception through the process of concept formation and inductive and deductive logic, that the proper moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness or rational self-interest, that the only social system consistent with this morality is full respect for individual rights, embodied in laissez faire capitalism, and that the role of art in human life is to transform man's widest metaphysical ideas, by selective reproduction of reality, into a physical form-a work of art-that one can comprehend and to which he can respond emotionally.\nObjectivism (Ayn Rand) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

   "BUT...(same link as previous):\nAcademic philosophers have generally dismissed Rand's ideas... Because of Rand's criticism of contemporary intellectuals,Objectivism has been called \"fiercely anti-academic\". David Sidorsky, a professor of moral and political philosophy at Columbia University, says Rand's work is \"outside the mainstream\" and is more of an ideological movement than a well-grounded philosophy. Rand is not found in the comprehensive academic reference texts The Oxford Companion to Philosophy or The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, but is the subject of entries in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, The Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers, the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, and The Routledge Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Political Thinkers. A listing of Rand also appears in the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, featuring the assessment \"The influence of Rand's ideas was strongest among college students in the USA but attracted little attention from academic philosophers. Her outspoken defence of capitalism in works like Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal (1967), and her characterization of her position as a defence of the 'virtue of selfishness' in her novel of the same title (published in 1974), also brought notoriety, but kept her out of the intellectual mainstream.\"\n \n In recent years Rand's works are more likely to be encountered in the classroom...\n \n According to one Rand biographer, most people \"encounter\" Rand's works in their \"formative years.\" ... Rand's former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Nathaniel Branden referred to Rand's \"especially powerful appeal to the young,\" while Onkar Ghate of the Ayn Rand Institute said Rand \"appeals to the idealism of youth.\" This appeal has alarmed a number of critics of the philosophy. Many of these young people later abandon their \"affection or admiration\" for Rand and are often said to have \"outgrown\" them.... Supporters of Rand's work recognize the phenomenon, but attribute it to the loss of youthful idealism and inability to resist social pressures for intellectual conformity. In contrast, Jennifer Burns says some critics \"dismiss Rand as a shallow thinker appealing only to adolescents,\" although Burns thinks the critics \"miss her significance\" as a \"gateway drug\" to right-wing politics.\n \n Psychologist Albert Ellis has argued that adherence to Objectivism can result in hazardous psychological effects.After he was expelled from Rand's circle, her former lover and notable psychologist Nathaniel Branden criticized Objectivism's \"destructive moralism,\" something he reports having engaged in himself when he was associated with Rand. He now argues that Rand's fiction, if not her explicit ideas, \"subtly encourages repression, self-alienation, and guilt.\"\n",

Taxes are raised or Lowered by People that are elected to make such decisions.. in reality our Society cannot exist without taking in tax dollars to pay for the many things we as a NATION must pay for. As I said before, I don't like paying taxes either, but I'm not going to whine about something beyond my control as an individual in a Society. \n \n \n\n That is correct, which is why I asked what happens if you don't buy food. You starve.\n\n \n no I go hunting. \n \n \n\n I am actually going to have to quote that one too.\n \n evil -adjective \n 1. morally wrong or bad; immoral; wicked: evil deeds; an evil life. \n\n \n \n\n Find that claim.\n\n \n Just look back over this thread.. you've called it Evil several times and I disagreed. You act as if paying taxes is Evil or Immoral because it fits into your dream world.. but it doesn't make it true. \n \n \n\n Representation is irrelevant.\n\n \n no they are not. If you tell someone to speak on your behalf then you can't complain when they don't say what you should have said yourself.\n \n \n\n They would if I made more money :p That is besides the point though. It is not immoral because it's unequal (although it is unequal right now), it is immoral because it is my property at gun point, the definition of theft by any sane definition of theft.\n\n \n and who is holding a gun to your head and making you pay taxes?. Did you not accept your job knowing full well that income taxes were going to come directly out of your pay?.. Did you buy that can of beans knowing they were charging you a 7 cent tax on that can of beans?.. No one forces YOU to participate in the Evil Society, you do so of your own free will.\n \n \n\n If you are willing to pay taxes then there is no 'need' to force you. Hence they need not be taxes. I don't mind you paying for whatever you want, I mind you claiming the right to use force to make other people pay for what you want.\n\n \n They don't force me to pay taxes. I'm free to quit my job. I'm free to hunt for my food instead of buying that heavily taxed food at the market. I've never had a Government official or military person come to my house and stick a gun to my head to force me to pay taxes. \n \n \n\n I almost always speak for myself.\n\n \n as you should.",

   "But then it's no longer \"gay history\" now is it? Those contributions had nothing to do with the sexual orientation of the contributor, therefore the only reason there is to make an issue of that is political.

The only reason to make an issue of his sexual preferences is for some special-interest agenda.\n\n \n The question of is it part of an agenda is like asking if there is water in the ocean.

I those who did not agree refused to pay soldieirs would be sent to take their wealth, and against any trustees of the disenter who also refused to submit to the demand.\n \n \nYou might have disagreed to the tax but the Majority did not \n\n Then the majority can pay it.\n \n \nthat doesn't make that tax evil.\n \n If it is a tax it is evil, for if it only applies to those who agree with it and have promised to pay it, it is not a tax and as I have said before that is why I condemn all taxes.\n \n \nThere you go assuming you know something.

Yes.\n \n That is irrelavant. Being informed of the theft is not the problem, the theft is.\n \n \nDid you buy that can of beans knowing they were charging you a 7 cent tax on that can of beans?.. No one forces YOU to participate in the Evil Society, you do so of your own free will.\n\n You proceed on the assumption that anyone has a right to steal a percentage of sales, income, or property regularly. They do not.\n \n If you want to go create your own community where everything is just the way it is now, go ahead; I won't complain unless you force someone to go there which would be all the difference that is required to make it moral. You would however be like the Amish, being held together only by the agreement of everyone involved to not interact with others and to live by the rules you setup.\n \n That is no doubt how you would like to paint the current situation but that is not the case, if I wanted to sell someone something or pay them for a job money would be stolen.\n \n The problem is not being forced to buy, sell, employ, or own; it is being forced to pay taxes on those things without agreeing.\n \n In other words, the Nazi's didn't force the Jews to kill themselves, the Jews choose to continue living of their own free will.\n \n \nThey don't force me to pay taxes. I'm free to quit my job. I'm free to hunt for my food instead of buying that heavily taxed food at the market.\n\n They don't have the right to tax your job. You could also give away your house to get out of property taxes, never buy anything to get out of sales taxes. You could kill yourself to avoid all taxes.\n \n That doesn't mean you gave consent to pay them.\n \n If a car company stole your money gave you a car you didn't agree to buy, and said \"we don't force you to travel so this is moral\" I would have the exact same contempt for them as have for taxers.\n \n \n I've never had a Government official or military person come to my house and stick a gun to my head to force me to pay taxes. \n\n You haven't tried it then :p\n \n \nWhat if nobody agreed to pay for health care?\n I would imagine that if you did not pay the appropriate taxes you would not get the benefits.\n\n Yes exactly, it's not that complicated; you don't pay for something you don't get it.

A fire like a criminal is a danger to more than just the person reporting them, and I would not leave someone to have all their property burned away or to be ravaged by criminals even if they didn't pay. i.e. I would still pay for police and fire if they weren't being discriminatory.\n \n What then compels people to pay for the police or fire department? They could just not pay and let 'everyone else' float the bill right?\n \n Nothing individually, but the premise of a democratic society is the responsible citizen.

For instance in new york crime was so bad at one point that you could get elected based on your promise to reduce it. Such a populace would no doubt increase their payments to the police.\n \n That being said I think there are simple easy ways to motivate people to individually pay. For instance you could provide along with police and fire protection theft and fire insurance which would not be paid to someone who didn't support the departments. The fire and police could for the most part out compete private insurance because unlike private insurance if they do their job exceptionally well they won't pay out as much in insurance claims. This would also motivated the departments themselves to do the job well as more money kept for the department means better equipment and pay.\n \n For instance if the police can recover stolen goods they just saved themselves the cost of paying for them. If the fire department can save a structure for the most part they would save themselves the cost of paying for it's reconstruction.\n \n Further since the justification for putting out a fire or stopping a criminal is to protect people who have paid, many of the things the police or fire department do would not apply to non-payers. Protective custody, searching for stolen property, fire safety inspections, mediating civil disputes, etc... could be kept from a non-payer. and if the insurance thing above was implemented you can be sure that a motivation gap would exist between protecting non-payers and protecting payers.\n \n The police and fire are examples of necessarily public services, but it's true most functions of government can be a service paid for and only rendered upon payment.

One can see this is true just by looking at the history of industry, we all know that most people would still not be able to afford a car if they had to be hand built but if you were to follow the leftist model the solution to expensive cars would be to set the minimum wage high enough so that everyone could afford a hand built car, it is doubtful a car company would even survive such a law much less automate and start producing cars that anyone could afford like it did.\n \n Manual labor as the inglorious drudgery that it has hence existed has been slowly beaten away by advancing technology and investment... and that trend will continue all the quicker if companies would be allowed to make enough money for more self-investment.\n \n \nI still think it would be a viable and tremendously dynamic society.\n One could see taxes in the same way as insurance..not everyone pays car or house insurance but it still works pretty well overall. \n\n I think the comparison to insurance is very apt.\n \n I would also like to point out that at least in America a good amount of people don't pay for these services which we all agree are necessary and it's working right now.\n \n \nWhy?\n\n http://www.4forums.com/political/formal-open-debate/14447-society-based-volition-ideal-one.html \n \n \nWhy?

This would also motivated the departments themselves to do the job well as more money kept for the department means better equipment and pay.\n\n \n The insurance would benefit from the increased police performance so instead of burdening police with insurance administration have a small % of those policies be for police administered by insurance since they have the infrastructure in place already.\n \n \nFor instance if the police can recover stolen goods they just saved themselves the cost of paying for them. If the fire department can save a structure for the most part they would save themselves the cost of paying for it's reconstruction.\n\n \n Same as with police\n \n \nFurther since the justification for putting out a fire or stopping a criminal is to protect people who have paid, many of the things the police or fire department do would not apply to non-payers.

Look at a wildfire getting ready to sweep down on a community. Half have paid for fire service and half have not. The fire dept came out to inspect brush clearance but only half the houses. The other half let brush to close and now fire threatens all. They are obligated to put out the fire which will benefit non payers as well as payers. They would be compelled to clear brush from non payers because it endangers the houses of payers. If one floor of an office building doesn't pay for inspection or service that have to receive it anyway in order to protect the payers.\n \n \n \nThe police and fire are examples of necessarily public services, but it's true most functions of government can be a service paid for and only rendered upon payment. Some of the big ones would be civil litigation, and the privilege to vote.\n\n \n Civil litigation is not free. Only criminal defense is at public cost, but there will need to be lawyers who defend the government against legal action and who prosecute criminal cases. Unless you hire private to litigate all cases, but who pays for them and who determines who to hire? Who is responsible for payment if the government is found liable or guilty?\n \n The privilege to vote? Who gets that and who decides? This is new, at least I don't recall you bringing it up before.\n \n \nThat is an excellent example. There is no reason that roads cannot be toll roads given current technology it could be tracked very accurately, in fact there is no reason that roads need to be run by a government; but of course we would have to see who does it better if and when a company tries to run a road.\n\n \n City streets included? Who manages this? There needs to be coordination between competing companies maintaining their roads so that stop signs look the same, strips are uniform, lights are synced for traffic control, don't walk signs are all the same etc?\n \n \nThat's not necessarily true, one could invest in their future production which technically wouldn't be charity. Also the fact that something is charity doesn't mean it can't be institutionalized in the government.\n\n \n As in loans?\n \n \nAs leftist love to point out manual labor is already poorly paid just in far off countries without minimum wage laws. We don't even know if a modern economy would function without cheap labor.\n\n \n An economy will find a way to function, none of use can supply all of our needs ourselves no matter how much we minimize them.\n \n \n \nLuckily the production of wealth increases in a non-linear manner naturally, so the need for manual labor would go down with time as machines take over.\n \n Unlike some of the extremely foolish propaganda about mechanization and increases in efficiency in general would tell us when a machine does a manual laborers job it is saving a human from having to do the work, it may be a immediate problem for the man replaced but in the long run he needs less money to live well because the product will be cheaper and the economy in general will be more willing to pay him for less menial work because it has more money.

Since the 1950's technology was supposed to take over for man improving his life making things more affordable and allowing him the time to do more enjoyable things. We were supposed to be The Jetsons by now. The reality is technology has made it possible to do more things faster, but we now have more things to do. While we feel goods are more accessible don't forget a major part of the cost is the technology that made it. When Mercedes builds a plant for 1Billion it has to sell a lot of cars to pay for that.\n With all that modern technology has brought us we have less time, more stress and our disposable income is losing to inflation, and no I wouldn't trade technology to go backwards.\n \n \n \nManual labor as the inglorious drudgery that it has hence existed has been slowly beaten away by advancing technology and investment... and that trend will continue all the quicker if companies would be allowed to make enough money for more self-investment.\n\n \n As long as there is greed there will be poverty and as long as there is poverty there will be cheap labor and as long as there is cheap labor there will be greed.\n \n \nI would also like to point out that at least in America a good amount of people don't pay for these services which we all agree are necessary and it's working right now.\n\n \n Because more middle and higher income earners pick up the tab by paying higher taxes. Which they would love the chance to not do. People are ok as long as they perceive things are reasonably fair. You will run into problems the minute that perception changes.\n \n \nhttp://www.4forums.com/political/formal-open-debate/14447-society-based-volition-ideal-one.html \n \n \n Let the slave commit suicide, then he will not have to work for the master. Having a job is a trade between me and my employer, ours is the only consent required, you do not have a right to steal my money just because I am trading with someone.\n\n \n \n We had a period when there were really no labor laws and business ran its business how it wanted. Then in response to the abuses we enacted labor laws and the country prospered like no other time in history. What we need is a place in between.

   " Respond. You have claimed this argument isn't good enough, well just saying that isn't good enough. \"I am right until proven otherwise\".\n\n \n The Dream World you describe is an impossible world , plain and simple. You would do away with forced taxes yet require that people pay their way through life which in a round about way is worse than the taxes you despise so much. Take roads for instance. Suppose instead of Charging a Tax which everyone pays to build and maintain a Freeway, you were to turn that freeway into a toll road. Every other road is also a toll road.. so If I want to use this road I must pay a toll each time I decide I want to drive on that road. It might cost me say 10 dollars a day to make my way through all the toll booths just to get to work, then I'll have to pay again on my way home. If I refuse to pay then what?.. will I be banned from using said road?. \n \n No this world you describe is far worse than the one we live in now. The Government takes a Tax out of my pay each week or month and that relatively small amount of money is pooled together with all the other taxes and used to Pay for these things which make life easier for ALL of us. If I don't have a Job I don't pay this tax but I am not penalized by losing the same benefits that working people have. I pay a food tax when I buy Groceries just like everyone else does. Those taxes are pooled together to Pay for needed Government services such as Road maintenance which benefits ALL of us. I am not discriminated against if I am unable to pay such a tax. \n \n I will agree with you on one thing.. Taxes are Bad.. No one likes to pay them. But I would bet if suddenly we didn't have taxes and living under this dream world you describe you would soon find more people crying because they simply wouldn't want to pay out their ears for everything that is a necessity and already being paid for under the tax system. \n \n I've read you post three times now and still have read nothing that would convince me that a world without taxes is a possibility. \n \n \n \n \n\n You are an accessory by voting for and supporting individuals who will violate more rights than others.\n",

What do you mean by include? and how would a surplus reduce operating costs?\n \n \nTax leins\n\n Besides threatening their rights...\n \n \nSuch a populace would not have the degree of need as most would be honest people who would not view theft, assault and murder as options to their problems.\n\n Most people aren't criminals, yet criminals are still a problem.\n \n \nThe insurance would benefit from the increased police performance so instead of burdening police with insurance administration have a small % of those policies be for police administered by insurance since they have the infrastructure in place already.\n \n Same as with police\n\n If you can get them to sign up, sure.\n \n \nThis is where you will run into problems. Look at a wildfire getting ready to sweep down on a community. Half have paid for fire service and half have not. The fire dept came out to inspect brush clearance but only half the houses. The other half let brush to close and now fire threatens all. They are obligated to put out the fire which will benefit non payers as well as payers. They would be compelled to clear brush from non payers because it endangers the houses of payers. If one floor of an office building doesn't pay for inspection or service that have to receive it anyway in order to protect the payers.\n\n I was more talking about internal fire hazards, to get a good insurance rate one would no doubt have to provide expert reference of your low risk, a service provided automatically by payers, and possibly good insurance too.\n \n \nCivil litigation is not free.\n\n I am talking about paying for the maintenance of the courts for the privilege of being recognized in a civil case.\n \n \nOnly criminal defense is at public cost, but there will need to be lawyers who defend the government against legal action and who prosecute criminal cases. Unless you hire private to litigate all cases, but who pays for them and who determines who to hire? Who is responsible for payment if the government is found liable or guilty?\n\n There would be no central 'government' which can be sued, (unless you try to sue a section of the populace which might happen). You would sue departments, whatever organization is responsible in case. That organization would also be responsible for getting a lawyer and defending itself, paying from where ever it receives funding.\n \n It is obvious that the law and order system is integrated and I do not see the point is separating financing for police and prosecution. i.e. whatever unified body represents the anti-criminal part of the justice system would at appropriate levels of locality decide how to divvy up subscriptions, possibly based on an internal charter that was established by the people.\n \n I believe a standardized police charter should be specified in the new/heavily modified constitution along with other charters as a template for local populations to establish local departments, however obviously they may make amendments for their own community.\n \n \nThe privilege to vote? Who gets that and who decides? This is new, at least I don't recall you bringing it up before.\n\n One would have to pay for the maintenance of the core of the government, i.e. what allows you to vote, the thing that gets things done.\n \n I think the ideal would be to have what I called 'the people system', it is literally a system, a computer system designed to replace representative government with popular voting.\n \n The reason we have representatives (the right reason) is because it was impossible for everyone to vote on everything due to logistics. That is no longer the case.\n \n The auxiliaries to the people system would be an executive branch to initiate approved government actions (i.e. the guys on the ground hiring people and making plans). They would not be the people policing or constructing things they would be agents of the the people, i.e. they organize the construction of the park or the water system based on parameters set forth in the government action. The executive branch would have hierarchy based on locality of action, and whose members would be voted upon at regular intervals much like current officials.\n \n The people system would not just have simple votes, some actions do not require a majority simply a minimum funding level; the system would allow citizens to commit funds as well.\n \n A justice branch would be responsible for the other half of government, enforcing laws. This would be the various levels of courts and police organizations much like they exist now, to be paid by locality much like current county, state, federal taxes but of course voluntary. Therefore if people place more emphasis (by their financial support) on federal justice systems those will become larger, and vice versa.\n \n The core of the system is the executive branch and the computer system itself. Note however that those costs are no doubt going to be low.\n \n \nCity streets included? Who manages this? There needs to be coordination between competing companies maintaining their roads so that stop signs look the same, strips are uniform, lights are synced for traffic control, don't walk signs are all the same etc?\n\n Companies have proven that they can cooperate with each other as well as adhere to standards, in the computer industry especially. No matter what it will be up to the people in an area how they want to do it, a company can't force them to use it's roads if they want government roads.\n \n \nAs in loans?\n\n Of a type yes.\n \n \nAn economy will find a way to function, none of use can supply all of our needs ourselves no matter how much we minimize them.\n\n True, but it could be a very bad economy compared to what we have had.\n \n \nThis is partially true. Since the 1950's technology was supposed to take over for man improving his life making things more affordable and allowing him the time to do more enjoyable things. We were supposed to be The Jetsons by now. The reality is technology has made it possible to do more things faster, but we now have more things to do. While we feel goods are more accessible don't forget a major part of the cost is the technology that made it. When Mercedes builds a plant for 1Billion it has to sell a lot of cars to pay for that.\n With all that modern technology has brought us we have less time, more stress and our disposable income is losing to inflation, and no I wouldn't trade technology to go backwards.\n\n What makes you think we have less time, more stress do to technological advancement? inflation occurs but certainly not because of technology.\n \n \nAs long as there is greed there will be poverty and as long as there is poverty there will be cheap labor and as long as there is cheap labor there will be greed.\n\n rofl, show me how greed can cause poverty in a free society please.\n \n \nBecause more middle and higher income earners pick up the tab by paying higher taxes. Which they would love the chance to not do. People are ok as long as they perceive things are reasonably fair. You will run into problems the minute that perception changes.\n\n If rich people think how much they are paying is fair then they will continue to pay that much, otherwise according to you we have a problem :p\n \n \n \nWe had a period when there were really no labor laws and business ran its business how it wanted. Then in response to the abuses we enacted labor laws and the country prospered like no other time in history.\n\n The country was almost destroyed by the fed and labor laws, the product of the liberty before was the industrial revolution.\n \n \nWhat we need is a place in between. The pendulum started swinging towards business and it abused the people. The people corrected this and things were good, now the pendulum is right at that point where you wonder does it have the momentum to continue or has it peaked and will start swinging back.\n \n A compromise between liberty and tyranny is an abomination and must be changed.\n \n \nIf they can get $500 a pop run with it:p\n\n Yea should have saw that coming, there simply isn't any aspect of a man's freedom you would throw in the mud is there?\n \n \nSame question as above concerning city streets and what about sidewalks and bike paths and alleys?\n\n I presume the streets are government property now, what's the problem?\n \n \nThe Dream World you describe is an impossible world , plain and simple. You would do away with forced taxes yet require that people pay their way through life which in a round about way is worse than the taxes you despise so much. Take roads for instance. Suppose instead of Charging a Tax which everyone pays to build and maintain a Freeway, you were to turn that freeway into a toll road. Every other road is also a toll road.. so If I want to use this road I must pay a toll each time I decide I want to drive on that road. It might cost me say 10 dollars a day to make my way through all the toll booths just to get to work, then I'll have to pay again on my way home. If I refuse to pay then what?.. will I be banned from using said road?. \n \n No this world you describe is far worse than the one we live in now. The Government takes a Tax out of my pay each week or month and that relatively small amount of money is pooled together with all the other taxes and used to Pay for these things which make life easier for ALL of us. If I don't have a Job I don't pay this tax but I am not penalized by losing the same benefits that working people have. I pay a food tax when I buy Groceries just like everyone else does. Those taxes are pooled together to Pay for needed Government services such as Road maintenance which benefits ALL of us. I am not discriminated against if I am unable to pay such a tax. \n\n Two points.\n 1. You make the assumption that it would cost more if it wasn't immoral taxation, why?\n 2. \"If I don't have a Job I don't pay this tax but I am not penalized by losing the same benefits that working people have\" This is the problem, any other objectivist would label that scenario parasitism. It isn't necessarily but certainly if you want benefits without paying for them, some one must be willing to pay for them; you may not decide that you'd like to have the wealth that working people have and just take it from them in the form of privileges.\n \n \nI will agree with you on one thing.. Taxes are Bad.. No one likes to pay them. But I would bet if suddenly we didn't have taxes and living under this dream world you describe you would soon find more people crying because they simply wouldn't want to pay out their ears for everything that is a necessity and already being paid for under the tax system. \n\n Point one.\n \n \nI've read you post three times now and still have read nothing that would convince me that a world without taxes is a possibility\n\n Either you don't understand it, you don't think it's correct but you won't give your reasoning (a response), or you think it's correct and just won't admit it.\n \n Which is it?",

Is everything COD? \n \n \nMost people aren't criminals, yet criminals are still a problem.\n\n \n This goes to my belief that to work the population must be at a cultural level of a higher moral standard than is possessed now. Generally speaking, of course there are those who are but to many who aren't are spread around them.\n \n \nIf you can get them to sign up, sure.\n\n \n Otherwise your costs will significantly increase, you create the temptation for corruption and likelyhood of bankrupting the police and fire dept.\n \n \nI was more talking about internal fire hazards, to get a good insurance rate one would no doubt have to provide expert reference of your low risk, a service provided automatically by payers, and possibly good insurance too.\n\n \n Why would insurance see your home or office as low risk when the next door is a fire trap waiting for a spark?\n \n \nI am talking about paying for the maintenance of the courts for the privilege of being recognized in a civil case.\n\n \n So you would just significantly increase court fees, which currently supplement court costs, the majority of which are now funded through taxes. With no taxes, support would have to come from the fees you describe. Again setting up temptation for corruption and pricing civil litigation out of the reach of some people. Removing or at least making justice more difficult to be had by all. Lose justice and your society will collapse.\n \n \nThere would be no central 'government' which can be sued, (unless you try to sue a section of the populace which might happen). You would sue departments, whatever organization is responsible in case. That organization would also be responsible for getting a lawyer and defending itself, paying from where ever it receives funding.\n\n \n And when a wealthy person or organization manipulates information and public support is lacking the department will be unable to defend itself. When it goes bankrupt it must be replaced and start up is always costly. \n \n What type of precedent may come from such an outcome. Could not similar departments find themselves severely handicapped for fear of a legal decision based not on merits but ability to defend. Will other companies be as willing to enter the same business at the same cost with the increased risk exposure?\n \n \nIt is obvious that the law and order system is integrated and I do not see the point is separating financing for police and prosecution. i.e. whatever unified body represents the anti-criminal part of the justice system would at appropriate levels of locality decide how to divvy up subscriptions, possibly based on an internal charter that was established by the people.\n\n \n Ok but do you think a great deal will be allocated to public defense knowing that each conviction or dismissal can have an effect on their budget and earnings. And the same questions as above would apply here as well.\n \n \nI believe a standardized police charter should be specified in the new/heavily modified constitution along with other charters as a template for local populations to establish local departments, however obviously they may make amendments for their own community.\n\n \n As long as they can agree on what is and is not permissible and the fines for failure to comply.

That is no longer the case.\n\n \n Because everybody forgets that the politician gets one vote same as everybody else. His personal moral and ethic beliefs are meaningless beyond that one vote. Our government is full of people who were considered the the best of what is available and not the best for the job. A representatives job is to represent the people who sent him or her there not represent their own beliefs. This is why people think their vote doesn't count and why they feel a disconnect with government. \n \n \nThe auxiliaries to the people system would be an executive branch to initiate approved government actions (i.e. the guys on the ground hiring people and making plans).

Technology has long been seen as offering the ability to do far more in less time, but the time gained has constantly been filled with more to do. We work more hours than our grandparents and the days of a stay at home parent are almost extinct. Granted some by choice but they are the minority.

If over I assume a request will be made to cover the shortfall and if over either a refund or applied to the next period's bill.\n\n That sounds reasonable, but I would like to again emphasize that there is no need to 'hard code' such things.\n \n There is no moral dilemma to doing it another way unless the other way involves stealing money, killing or imprisoning innocent people etc...\n \n You can have people agree to pay for it up to a certain maximum where the maximum is well above projected costs to avoid having to vote again, you could have the organization have it's own way of funding which is not tied to funding votes (subscriptions, fees, tolls etc...).\n \n \n\n How do you collect from those who commit to pay but don't. Is everything COD? \n\n The police come and take it. There is no moral issue with enforcing contracts. They did agree volitionally.\n \n \nThis goes to my belief that to work the population must be at a cultural level of a higher moral standard than is possessed now. Generally speaking, of course there are those who are but to many who aren't are spread around them.\n\n Criminals wouldn't destroy the system or harm it any more than they do this one.\n \n If you are saying people in modern societies act like XXXXXX and rely on bureaucrats to think for them on all social issues, that might be true but the problem is only going to get worse unless we start flexing that muscle again.\n \n We'd survive the transition and it would only get better from there.\n \n \nOtherwise your costs will significantly increase, you create the temptation for corruption and likelyhood of bankrupting the police and fire dept.\n\n How could the fire department or the police abuse the system more than anyone can try to for any insurance?\n \n Also why would it be more expensive for them to offer insurance, I think it would be less because they would have the opportunity to avoid paying out claims based on the quality of their work. That would be true of an insurance company which has to pay out less because the police or firefighters do well, but I don't see how it would be better.\n \n \nWhy would insurance see your home or office as low risk when the next door is a fire trap waiting for a spark?\n\n Well less of a risk than if your place was a fire trap. Sounds like something would probably get worked in to the HA agreement.\n \n \nSo you would just significantly increase court fees, which currently supplement court costs, the majority of which are now funded through taxes.\n\n I am glad you phrased it like that because I am not making it more expensive.\n \n \nWith no taxes, support would have to come from the fees you describe. \n\n Yes, and other government departments would have to pay them as well so the use of courts for criminal justice would flow through the criminal justice funding.\n \n \nAgain setting up temptation for corruption and pricing civil litigation out of the reach of some people.\n\n The risk of coruption would be much less than and certainly not greater than now. Those in charge of setting fees would be elected and parameters of any kind for the proper compensation of judges can established.\n \n Now compare that to now where the actual finances are taken care of immortal bureaucrats appointed who knows when in the depths of some acronymed department. \n \n I am not claiming competition will keep them honest, but if you are careful about how you word the creation bill you can make it nearly impossible to make it cost much more than it should.\n \n \nRemoving or at least making justice more difficult to be had by all.\n\n Perhaps it would be better to make it more like a subscription, low and spread out cost which you need to pay not just before your court case but in general. The bad part about that is it might bloat the courts a bit, having more judges, installations, and personal than is actually utilized.\n \n \nAnd when a wealthy person or organization manipulates information and public support is lacking the department will be unable to defend itself. When it goes bankrupt it must be replaced and start up is always costly. \n\n You talk about manipulating information or public support as if you could escape it in any system. Public defenders are assigned to citizens who cannot afford one, they can be assigned to a department that cannot afford one; but you realize that you are painting a pretty tight budgeted department. Further you could have legal insurance for departments, or even a government organization dedicated to providing legal defense to other government organizations :p\n \n Don't forget that given objective laws lawyers have much less power over the outcome of litigation than otherwise. I am not saying lawyers don't mean anything or the truth will always win out, just easier.\n \n The military is an excellent example of clearly defined duties such that the liability of it's members for problems is not often is dispute (given how large it is).\n \n One would simply have to design the department well so that personal dereliction is not paid for by the department or vice versa.\n \n \nWhat type of precedent may come from such an outcome. Could not similar departments find themselves severely handicapped for fear of a legal decision based not on merits but ability to defend. Will other companies be as willing to enter the same business at the same cost with the increased risk exposure?\n\n Uh companies and departments aren't the same thing, the government(the people through the executive branch) can hire or contract with companies but if the company screws up it's the companies liability.\n \n Fear of litigation is possible in just about everything, but the definitions of negligence that are being used now seem to work 'ok'.\n \n If you are saying people in important positions need to be immune to legal liability, I think that's true to a point; but in such cases the liability must revert to somewhere it does belong, like who ever put the person in an impossible position.\n \n I think a comparison with the medical profession is in order. It is well known (to me at least) that fear of legal action is a huge issue for doctors, it has driven prices up significantly.\n \n I think the solution to that is to define more precisely what is actually a breach of contract vs an inevitable risk.\n \n The same applies here. We all know police coruption happens, but we need to define it well so that good cops aren't afraid to do their jobs but bad cops still get caught.\n \n In any case any difficulty on this point would be universal to any system involving liability and fallible officers and agents of the state.\n \n \nOk but do you think a great deal will be allocated to public defense knowing that each conviction or dismissal can have an effect on their budget and earnings. And the same questions as above would apply here as well.\n\n Performance ought to effect budget and earnings, they can secure their funding a year at a time or at any interval seems appropriate.\n \n There is no need to have public defenders part of the finances for the justice system, the fees should be grouped by function; defending people is not part of putting them in jail :p\n \n \nAs long as they can agree on what is and is not permissible and the fines for failure to comply. Otherwise you could end up with permitted behavior on one side of the street and a felony on the other.\n\n Wait a second, the charter is not the law; it's just how you run the police an prosecution organizations. The law is universal, voted upon directly by the people according to other rules and has nothing to do with money.\n \n If you are saying there are ways a community should not be allowed to enforce the law I find it hard to imagine, the real problem would be not enforcing the law or even worse breaking it :p\n \n I think there definitely needs to be a central registry of justice departments and their jurisdictions, further there should be sections of the charter which cannot be modified or you don't get to register your department as a real police one, like for instance a section about the oath of officers to enforce the law and not let criminals go.\n \n \nOh taxes, I sure just a slip but you used the have to phrase emoticon_xangel\n\n In the context of the answer it was 'have to in order to have the privilege to vote' and you know it :p\n \n \nSorry I can't get past visions of Terminator or The Matrix, but I believe we may have found something to be 100% in agreement on.\n\n Lol, good. As far as software it would actually be quite simple so no skynet, the hard part would be making it tamper proof; but again our current system doesn't seem to take the prize on that either.\n \n \nBecause everybody forgets that the politician gets one vote same as everybody else. His personal moral and ethic beliefs are meaningless beyond that one vote. Our government is full of people who were considered the the best of what is available and not the best for the job. A representatives job is to represent the people who sent him or her there not represent their own beliefs. This is why people think their vote doesn't count and why they feel a disconnect with government. \n\n Quite true, although I am not blaming representatives; they have no choice but to represent their own beliefs.\n \n I think the number one biggest problem with the disconnect you mention is that people do not feel responsible for the actions of government (and they aren't) because it's not really in their hands, they can't possibly be charged with knowing what decisions the people they elect will make. This means that the bulk of political strife in this country (and others no doubt) is simply a blame game.\n \n That is bad enough, but representatives don't feel particularly responsible either; they may tell themselves they did what the people wanted or that they did what they wanted, but they always tell themselves they were just doing their jobs.\n \n One thing everyone seems to agree on is that the government acts irresponsibly, could that be because no one is responsible for it?\n \n When joe votes for or against war in iraq, when jill had to decide what she thought of a public option; that is when we will start seeing some real foresight and consistency in government. That is not to say that the government will have a unified plan, but what elements are unified will be effective.\n \n Finally the argument for republic vs monarchy or dictator applies to democracy vs republic. It's simply less likely that 100,000,000 people will be corrupt than it is 100, just like it is less likely that 100 people will be corrupt than 1, 2, or 3.\n \n If the truth is that 300 million people are more corrupt and have less interest in the well being of society than congress, than the premise of democracy itself is at odds with the evidence. If that were true, what the romans did would be in order, a congress that elects it's own members.\n \n \nWho pays them?\n\n People who want to vote.\n \n \nWho collects \n\n Either the executive branch or another branch which deals with finances exclusively. I was thinking about this accounting branch as a kind of check and balance, since they don't use most of the money themselves there would be little temptation to commit fraud, but I have since wondered whether that would be more trouble than help.\n \n \nand what happens if underfunded or over budget?\n\n I believe I answered a very similar question above. Contingency plans should be placed in the description of the activity bill. The core will not have a problem like that however as it should definitely report required revenue at the start of the year, if the executive branch needs to exceed that budget someone in there has to propose a bill for special funds.\n \n \nLeading to the justice system needing to please or be see as valuable to those willing to support it or running the risk of being unable to perform.\n\n Of course people need to see it as valuable. That by the way is the crime, trying to force people to pay for things they don't think are valuable.\n \n \nWhy?\n\n Compared to what the government costs it would be tiny, that is because all it's really doing is taking votes, hiring people, doing paperwork, and overseeing activities.\n \n It is not the programs themselves. Keep in mind I am just throwing numbers out there but I would guess 100 billion for the executive branch 75 billion (maintenance per year) for the computer system, and those are extremely generous.\n \n That's $583.32 per year per citizen. ($48/month) For most of us that's small, and if it's not for you write a letter of thanks to bill gates right now because you couldn't possibly afford your fair share of the internal revenue.\n \n \nVHS or Beta Blu Ray or HD. Who keeps opposing views from clashing? Who enforces general acceptance of standards? What happens for non compliance?\n\n Blu ray won, but you could easily create a standards committee which would only approve roads which pass inspection. Before you ask no they do not have the right to shut down a road, but if the regs are reasonable people won't feel safe on an unapproved road and won't pay to drive on it.\n \n I am merely not discounting private companies as road builders and owners, I don't think it would be anything but a waste of money unless they were willing to hold to standards because it would just infuriate their customers if they didn't.\n \n Companies with proprietary standards have almost always lost to open source formats and that's one of the reasons I am not an apple fan. The few times they have won they've been the best or are themselves openish.\n \n \nI see a bondage society just waiting to happen.\n\n Hey if you want to give away money instead no one (moral) will stop you.\n \n \nWell it isn't because of the tooth fairy. Technology has long been seen as offering the ability to do far more in less time, but the time gained has constantly been filled with more to do. We work more hours than our grandparents and the days of a stay at home parent are almost extinct. Granted some by choice but they are the minority. Inflation is not due to technology alone, but technology isn't cheap.\n\n Wait so even though technology saves time (working time I guess) it uses up more other time (leisure time)?\n \n How do you know that we just aren't working harder because we are spending more?\n \n \nLook around as the rich continue to increase their share of wealth\n\n Stop right there, we do not share wealth we make it and then we trade it to make even more. There is no piece of the pie business, the pie analogy is not even applicable unless you throw in a baker.\n \n If you had a static pool of currency (like I would like to have) you would see consistent deflation. That is because the 'pie' is getting bigger.... as people make it bigger...... by production.\n \n \nthe poor continue to grow and have less of it. Earnings and compensation are at disproportionate levels between the highest paid and lowest paid.\n\n By the decision of those who pay them, customers pay big shots and big shots pay 'the poor' (I know that is a pathetic oversimplification with bias), if the customers thought 'the poor' should get their money they would pay them but they don't because the big shots have the stuff to trade. i.e. the money is going where the production is.\n \n \nSomething is wrong in a business model that pays millions of dollars in bonus money to an executive who cuts costs by firing people. \n\n That is for the customers to decide.\n \n \nThe janitor can make that decision.\n\n If he not only cleaned the company but owned it sure.\n \n \nThey don't that is why we are dealing with people wandering around saying abolish corporate taxes and corporations are people who have no need to disclose how much they contribute to government.\n\n Well those wanderers would include me because corporate taxes fall under the umbrella of taxes. A corporation obviously wouldn't get a vote on the law, but someone with a ton of money by definition could support bigger and more government activities than a poor person, or they may support none and pay about the same as a poor person. That is their right, it doesn't cost more to protect a rich person from criminals for the police or to put out his fire for the FF, and if it does that would be factored into the risk of his property to theft or fire not how much he makes.\n \n I am not worried about corporations they are already all about production, I would be more worried about people who aren't producing much, they are the ones going to have a toughest time in a moral society without the ability to vote themselves more money.\n \n \n \nAmerica was never as prosperous as following WWII when labor laws started being enforced and the middle class began to thrive.\n\n Everywhere else was blown up, that is why americans were prosperous they didn't have much competition.\n \n \nAll or none always leads to tyranny for some.\n\n Could you please demonstrate how that could be possible?\n \n \nCome one Otherwise I wouldn't touch that with a ten foot pole and still won't.emoticon_smile\n\n ?? Come one?\n \n \nThey are maintained with tax dollars.\n\n Yes but you were talking about city planning, not funding.\n \n \nYep.. a Necessary Evil .. \n \n Oh you knew I would respond.. I still have no desire to argue over the Utopian Dream world.\n\n Taxation is immoral, this is why.\n \n If you do not wish to argue, don't respond.

You're simply invoking the fallacies of social prejudice and tradition and majority oppression. \n \n \nHomosexual behavior is an issue of social controversy,\n\n \n Again(see above), a fallacious argument in and of itself. Anti-gay is controversial too. What are the reasons it is \"controversial\" to some?\n \n \nand therefore playing up the issue by making an issue of the homosexuality of historic people is the equivalent of trying to make a point of historic people's view of other issues like whether they are pro-life or pro-choice. What's important about Alan Turning, for example, is his contribution to computer science, not the fact he had a gay sexual preference or whether or not he was pro-choice or pro-life.\n\n \n No, it's not just an issue, nor is it a choice. Gays are people who have faced prejudice just for being something that isn't a conscious choice. The pro-choice or not issue related to abortion is therefore a bad analogy. The discrimination and lack of acceptance, the very real persecution Turing faced, was just because he was gay, despite the fact that he contributed so much.

You want issues of anti-gay prejudice and discrimination, as well as gay people swept under the rug. Are you afraid to have your own indefensible prejudices questioned? These are not arguments you are making, just an appeal for ignorance on the subject. That's how we have traditionally dealt with this subject, but it doesn't make it a full and accurate account of history. It's not morally right to purposely exclude someone's being gay from the historical record, where it is warranted, just because the person is gay and some people may not like that without a rational reason. It's their prejudice which is the problem. \n \n \nSo you admit you are trying to get your morality forced into schools?? Wow.emoticon_wow\n\n \n I said both of us are coming from moral positions.

I heard somewhere that someone thought he was homosexual. Surely it is not just because he kept male company... in an army...\n \n \nI said both of us are coming from moral positions. It's all morality.\n\n Bravo, the sooner everyone realizes that their 'personal opinions' are probably moral theories the sooner we can start arguing about what's important, moral theories.\n \n Ideologies come from philosophies, politics comes from ideologies. Arguing politics without similar ideals is pointless, as is arguing ideals without similar philosophy.\n \n The issues with homosexuals has always been 'is it moral' and continues under disguise only because those who would deem it immoral don't have the support they need from the 'science' of psychology and of course they can't justify it either; hec they probably don't even recognize it as a moral claim. Similarly homosexual advocates continue to fight against accusations of immorality also under the same guises, because unfortunately they too do not recognize nor justify their position. I am speaking of the general case of course.\n \n To answer 'is it moral' one needs a philosophy, specifically the branch ethics or else it is so much assertion of fact and no derivation, consistency, or support.\n \n Thus the homosexual issue getting nowhere because it is about ethics, and modern culture claims that's a lot of pseudo-scientific nonsense which no one can really understand, which is understandable sense most philosophers have had absurd ethical theories like god, pragmatism, subjectivism/relativism, altruism etc... Since the god theory is the only one that has a hope of condemning homosexuality the debate while not about this (although it should be) has been generated by 'theological ethics vs anything else'.\n \n A homosexual with no doubt of the morality of their attractions or acts does not and cannot feel guilt. The only reason the disapproval of others effects them is because there moral theory sets others as a barometer of the truth.\n \n Unfortunately many homosexuals do not understand what is happening and feel the only way to combat the guilt is to throw their beliefs in the complete opposite direction, making 'who they are' who they have sex with, the so called 'gay pride'. A homosexual advocate will tell you that it is beyond their choice and cannot be an object of shame. Do not forget then that if is beyond your control it ought not be a object of pride either. You achieve nothing by being a homosexual it simply is.\n \n This counter-movement has then led to people like jyoshu and gansao, who do not fear homosexuality as homosexuality but fear a new class of people claiming like racist special recognition or right's because of what is admittedly their birthright.\n \n jyoshu and Provocateaur it seems like you are talking past each other, do you both agree to these two statements:\n \n 1. History should be taught without bias no pertinent facts omitted and no irrelevant facts included.\n \n 2. Sexual orientation is very unlikely to be relevant except in the study various oppressions.\n \n Provocateaur, you mentioned that Lincoln had a wife; that is true but I don't think that in all the history I was ever taught was that mentioned.\n \n It is clear to me that provocateur is worried that even where one would normally note something that would indicate sexual orientation teachers would omit it because of prejudice or just the fact that they don't want to get into something with a parent. Jyoshu is worried that teachers would now be forced to go 'oh ya and he was gay so that means gay people are good'.",

They did agree volitionally.\n\n \n Oh this one is classic...\n You oppose taking money by force through taxes yet you will send the police to take it by force if I fail to live up to a contract. Under your society binding someone to a contract would be as immoral as charging them a tax. I am a member of a \"Free\" society so if I agree to pay for something I am also \" Free\" to change my mind. If you come and take my money by force you are then stealing my money and suddenly your utopian dream world begins to break down. \n \n \nThat's $583.32 per year per citizen. ($48/month) For most of us that's small, and if it's not for you write a letter of thanks to bill gates right now because you couldn't possibly afford your fair share of the internal revenue.\n\n \n Now you have set a specific number that I am supposed to pay, which you refer to as \" my fair share\". If I cannot afford to pay this myself I must rely on someone else to pay it for me. If someone in turn pays \" MY\" fair share then that person has a \" Controlling Interest\" in my life. This person may use this as leverage to force me to do a job I don't choose to do. \n \n Many Americans under our current society Pay into the revenue system through income taxes. For many of those people at the end of each year The Government turns around and issues them a refund of all income taxes they have paid in and in a lot of cases the refund is in excess of what was paid in. This is not Immoral theft.. it's more like the government borrowing your money and paying you back with interest. \n \n When you go to a grocery store and buy a can of beans in most cases there is a tax on that can of beans. You are not forced to buy those beans or to pay this tax. If you do then you are doing so of your own choice , therefore this tax is not forced and therefore is not Immoral theft. \n \n Under your free society you will have those who have and those who don't have. There is no middle ground. You either can afford to pay or you can't, and then you pay voluntarily which leads to resentment by those who pay over those who don't. Bill gates might pay my way for a year, but soon he will resent the fact that he is paying for someone else and he will no longer pay. the Idea that a society can thrive on the back of charity is beyond reason. \n \n You have yet to answer the question concerning roads and freeways, infrastructure, police departments, courts, military, department of motor vehicles, as well as other necessary agencies that cannot function without proper funding. Put them under the category Public services. You would still have a need to pay for these public services. If you did not have enough volunteer donators the toll for all these public services would be funded by ????????. If the money ran out or people did not have the money to donate then these services would break down. no one would want to work as a police officer and risk their life for no pay.. so you would be left without a police officer. \n Why would anyone want to pay a toll on a road when a single 1 cent tax paid by all will allow EVERYONE use of this road free of charge? I have seen small communities such as my own raise millions of dollars to build and maintain a water filtration system by implementing a mere 1/2 cent sales tax , and it was done so by popular vote. I fail to see the immorality in a tax that is decided by the voting public. \n \n You may see taxes as an evil, immoral theft of property , but I see at least some taxes as a necessity to ensure the progress of a society at large. It doesn't mean I agree that taxes are good, I don't. I don't like paying taxes any more than you do, but I realize the benefit it does for all of society. \n \n You want to know what Is Immoral ?.. \n \n when a man working a job making seven dollars an hour pays more taxes than the billionaire CEO who owns the company.. that is Immoral.\n \n when the Government pays 6 billion dollars a year in subsidies to a company that makes 34 billion dollars in profits... that is Immoral.\n \n when a corporate CEO gets a million dollar tax credit so he can fly his private jet around the world... that is immoral..\n \n when the government pays 700 billion dollars to big banks and the banks turn around and hand out 200 billion dollars in bonuses... that is immoral.\n \n Poor people for the most part don't pay taxes. Because of tax code loopholes put into place by a corrupt government rich corporations don't pay taxes. So what we are left with is a declining middle class strapped with the mounting debt caused by ignorant government policies ... that is immoral.\n \n So now you can see why I think your utopia is an impossibility. Sure it looks good on paper.. and sounds good in theory, I won't deny that. but we don't live on paper or in theory, we live in the real world where greed rules.",

   "Because someone has to pay to maintain the roads, and that is called taxation. We all pay for the roads so we all use them. In your world you have to pay a toll to set foot on the roads. If people are too poor to pay the tolls then they don't get to use the road or even walk on the road. Since then the roads would then be owned by the tolling corporation that maintains them for their paying customers then the poor would not be able to move around, not even to get to a job.\n\n No taxation is wealth removed irregardless of consent. Every free trade is proof that theft is not the only way to acquire money.\n \n If you do not want to place your transportation in the hands of a transportation company, don't pay them; pay someone else.\n \n \nIn my world view taxation is moral and good and I justify it by using your own criteria\n \n I have a moral duty to help pay for the upkeep of society, and my fellow human beings. To me Taxation is a moral good especially on the wealthy. For the wealthy made their wealth on the backs of others and the labor of others, the poor.\n\n Perhaps if you had read the argument through you would have seen that it does not end up with 'whatever I want is moral'.\n \n If you place great value on anything that is good and proper, but only for you; you cannot demonstrate it is universal as I have done for the right to liberty.\n \n You pay for whatever you want according to whatever duties you place on yourself, I only forbid you to force others to submit to your 'world view'.\n \n You have no right to tax a single dime from the richest man in the world for the exact same reason that ten thousand Christian radicals don't have the right to keep you from having sex with your own gender, this is the nature of morality and as xcaliber is so fond of saying, your opinion does not change the truth.\n \n On a last note the wealthy made their wealth by their own labor, and it's production is increased a thousand fold or more because of cooperation (trade). They do not owe more to those they traded with than what they agreed to pay, and what tradees agreed to be paid.\n \n \nSo if by popular vote it is decided to implement a tax it would be ok because this would then be a \"Moral\" vote based on a system designed to replace the Immoral representation . \n\n Oh no poor me xcaliber has found a loop hole in the philosophy I have been thinking out and debating for 10 years!\n \n Representation isn't immoral it's simply not as good a government as democracy. One could have a moral king, it's just much more unlikely to work out than a republic.\n \n If by popular vote it is decide to implement a tax it just as immoral as it has always been.\n \n \nOh this one is classic...\n You oppose taking money by force through taxes yet you will send the police to take it by force if I fail to live up to a contract. Under your society binding someone to a contract would be as immoral as charging them a tax. I am a member of a \"Free\" society so if I agree to pay for something I am also \" Free\" to change my mind. If you come and take my money by force you are then stealing my money and suddenly your utopian dream world begins to break down. \n\n There is no contradiction here, you are not free to change your mind after you promised not to, that is what a promise means. A contract is incontrovertible authority to enforce it granted by the signer. The signer has volitionally agreed to whatever they sign. Any attempt to confuse volition followed by dishonesty with no volition followed by victimization will fail but I would love to see you try.\n \n \nNow you have set a specific number that I am supposed to pay, which you refer to as \" my fair share\". \n\n Actually the 'fair share' part was referring to the fact that such a yearly charge is miniscule compared to what an equal share of current internal revenue is.\n \n \nIf I cannot afford to pay this myself I must rely on someone else to pay it for me. If someone in turn pays \" MY\" fair share then that person has a \" Controlling Interest\" in my life.\n\n Only if you want to vote.\n \n \nThis person may use this as leverage to force me to do a job I don't choose to do. \n\n If you didn't agree to do it this person can't make you. (Legally)\n \n \nMany Americans under our current society Pay into the revenue system through income taxes. For many of those people at the end of each year The Government turns around and issues them a refund of all income taxes they have paid in and in a lot of cases the refund is in excess of what was paid in. This is not Immoral theft.. it's more like the government borrowing your money and paying you back with interest.\n \n Justice for some at the expense of others, this is immoral. Further regardless of whether a thief returns the money, he has stolen it if he did not have implicit or explicit permission.\n \n \nWhen you go to a grocery store and buy a can of beans in most cases there is a tax on that can of beans. You are not forced to buy those beans or to pay this tax. If you do then you are doing so of your own choice , therefore this tax is not forced and therefore is not Immoral theft. \n\n It is still immoral theft because the existence of a way to avoid being the object of theft does not mean the theft is not theft.\n \n One can install security systems to avoid theft, and it is one's choice. That does not mean the thief trying to take your money is not a thief.\n \n When you go to a grocery store to buy a can of beans that trade requires only your consent and that of the store owner, if neither party wishes to include extra charges the trade can be morally closed without it. Thus what is happening if you tax the trade is that you are targeting one of the parties and taking their money, and this business about the theft being attached to the trade is just an excuse.\n \n The same can be demonstrated via ad absurdum, \"When you breathe it will cost you one trillion dollars. You are not forced to breathe you could kill yourself at any time. If you do then you are doing so of your own choice, therefore this tax is not forced and therefore is not immoral theft.\" \n \n The act of breathing does not require the consent of a taxer and therefore they have no moral claim to it's occurrence... but then again taxation and morality are mutually exclusive.\n \n \nUnder your free society you will have those who have and those who don't have. There is no middle ground.\n\n Under reality  there are only those who have something and those who don't, the reason we produce and trade is to convert the latter into the former.\n \n \nYou either can afford to pay or you can't, and then you pay voluntarily which leads to resentment by those who pay over those who don't. Bill gates might pay my way for a year, but soon he will resent the fact that he is paying for someone else and he will no longer pay.\n \n Then I suggest steps be taken to increase the number of people who can pay as opposed to immorally stealing from those who can and somehow thinking you've fixed anything.\n \n If bill gates needs something, he might be rational and not shoot his own foot to spite someone else.\n \n \nthe Idea that a society can thrive on the back of charity is beyond reason. \n\n That is true, charity only creates wealth if it triggers production; in which case charity could only be a catalyst.\n \n \nYou have yet to answer the question concerning roads and freeways, infrastructure, police departments, courts, military, department of motor vehicles, as well as other necessary agencies that cannot function without proper funding. Put them under the category Public services. You would still have a need to pay for these public services. If you did not have enough volunteer donators the toll for all these public services would be funded by ????????.\n \n If the money ran out or people did not have the money to donate then these services would break down. no one would want to work as a police officer and risk their life for no pay.. so you would be left without a police officer.\n\n I have answered you many times. Since I never claimed I had a way to morally preserve these institutions if no one was willing to pay for them I am not obligated to come up with any plan to do so.\n \n What will happen is they will be gone, and we will return to the Stone Age. That does not bother me in the least because I don't think for one minute that people do not value society.\n \n ?????? = nothing.\n \n \nWhy would anyone want to pay a toll on a road when a single 1 cent tax paid by all will allow EVERYONE use of this road free of charge?\n\n You can't change reality, if you charged everyone a 1 cent. The road is not free of charge you are just pretending that the taxes didn't pay for the road.\n \n If everyone used the road and it cost 1 cent per person to build and maintain the road than there is no reason the toll would be higher than 1 cent over similar time periods.\n \n If you believe companies are going to do this well the market will still keep them from hiring more people than they can put to use, charging much more than the road is worth.\n \n \nI have seen small communities such as my own raise millions of dollars to build and maintain a water filtration system by implementing a mere 1/2 cent sales tax , and it was done so by popular vote. I fail to see the immorality in a tax that is decided by the voting public. \n\n The decisions of any group of people are valid for that group of people and no more. If it was a moral decision than the term tax would not apply.\n \n If your community was willing to spend 1/2 cent per sale, than there is no reason to force the community to do what they are willing to do is there?\n \n \nYou may see taxes as an evil, immoral theft of property , but I see at least some taxes as a necessity to ensure the progress of a society at large. It doesn't mean I agree that taxes are good, I don't. I don't like paying taxes any more than you do, but I realize the benefit it does for all of society. \n\n Taxation is immoral, this is why.\n \n Support your claim that taxes are necessary for a society to grow.\n \n \nYou want to know what Is Immoral ?.. \n\n That desire is what led to me searching for it, and eventually recognizing it and finally discovering it myself. That desire is why I know it now, and why I am telling you what it is.\n \n \nwhen a man working a job making seven dollars an hour pays more taxes than the billionaire CEO who owns the company.. that is Immoral.\n\n Ceded, all taxes are immoral.\n \n \nwhen the Government pays 6 billion dollars a year in subsidies to a company that makes 34 billion dollars in profits... that is Immoral.\n \n when the government pays 700 billion dollars to big banks and the banks turn around and hand out 200 billion dollars in bonuses... that is immoral.\n \n\n Ceded, the money is in all likely hood stolen.\n \n \nwhen a corporate CEO gets a million dollar tax credit so he can fly his private jet around the world... that is immoral..\n\n That is not immoral provided the tax credit does not exceed how much was stolen from him, however it is impossible to tell how much was stolen or where it ended up.\n \n \nPoor people for the most part don't pay taxes. Because of tax code loopholes put into place by a corrupt government rich corporations don't pay taxes. So what we are left with is a declining middle class strapped with the mounting debt caused by ignorant government policies ... that is immoral.\n\n Sure is, let's equalize the 'middle class' with the non-tax paying rich and poor.\n \n \nSo now you can see why I think your utopia is an impossibility.\n\n lol, no I can't and neither can you or you would explain.",

   "You flaming liberals don't have to wait on the government to pass higher taxes to pony up. Just empty your collective wallets and send your money to Washington and shut up.\n\n \n Remember a Guy named Jesus. He commands this of you too. Sadly you and your religious right Republican christianist buddies have put Jesus in a suit and made him a wall street banker. Using Jesus as cover they despoil the earth, trod upon the poor, ignore the homeless and the hungry, and make the flag their False God.\n \n\n Matthew 16:24-27\n 24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, \"Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. 25 For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it. 26 What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul? 27 For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done. \n \n Mark 10:21\n 17 As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. \"Good teacher,\" he asked, \"what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" 18 \"Why do you call me good?\" Jesus answered. \"No one is good-except God alone. 19 You know the commandments: 'You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, you shall not defraud, honor your father and mother.'[d]\" 20 \"Teacher,\" he declared, \"all these I have kept since I was a boy.\" 21 Jesus looked at him and loved him. \"One thing you lack,\" he said. \"Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\" 22 At this the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth. 23 Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, \"How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!\" 24 The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, \"Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\" 26 The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, \"Who then can be saved?\" 27 Jesus looked at them and said, \"With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God.\" 28 Then Peter spoke up, \"We have left everything to follow you!\" 29 \"Truly I tell you,\" Jesus replied, \"no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel 30 will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age: homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields-along with persecutions-and in the age to come eternal life. 31 But many who are first will be last, and the last first.\" \n \n Matthew 25:31-46\n 31 \"When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. 32 All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33 He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. 34 \"Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, 36 I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.' 37 \"Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? 38 When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? 39 When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?' 40 \"The King will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.' 41 \"Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42 For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.' 44 \"They also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?' 45 \"He will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.' 46 \"Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.\" \n \n Mark 12:13-17\n \n 13 Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words. 14 They came to him and said, \"Teacher, we know that you are a man of integrity. You aren't swayed by others, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay the imperial tax[b] to Caesar or not? 15 Should we pay or shouldn't we?\" But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. \"Why are you trying to trap me?\" he asked. \"Bring me a denarius and let me look at it.\" 16 They brought the coin, and he asked them, \"Whose image is this? And whose inscription?\" \"Caesar's,\" they replied. 17 Then Jesus said to them, \"Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's.\" And they were amazed at him. \n \n Mark 12:28-34\n 28 One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, \"Of all the commandments, which is the most important?\" 29 \"The most important one,\" answered Jesus, \"is this: 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.[e] 30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'[f] 31 The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'[g] There is no commandment greater than these.\"\n 32 \"Well said, teacher,\" the man replied. \"You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him. 33 To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" 34 When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, \"You are not far from the kingdom of God.\" And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions.\n",

So charging them a yearly charge would be more than they can afford to pay and you would have more poverty because under your dream world solution if they can't pay they do without or die.\n \n \n\n Only if you want to vote.\n\n \n So voting within my society is dependent on whether or not I can afford to pay for my vote.. And it gets worse as we move through dream world....lol \n \n \n\n If you didn't agree to do it this person can't make you. \n\n \n Again you discount human nature , or rather you lack an understanding of human nature. If you owe someone money or anything else they have leverage over you. If you depend on someone to pay your expenses they hold leverage over you. If Bill Gates was paying my rent and he told me to do something or he would not pay my rent most anyone would do what they were told rather than face losing their home. No he didn't hold a gun to my head and force me to do it, he used his leverage to force me to make that decision or choose a worse alternative. \n \n \n \n Justice for some at the expense of others, this is immoral. Further regardless of whether a thief returns the money, he has stolen it if he did not have implicit or explicit permission.\n\n \n Everything in your dream world is immoral...lol\n \n \n\n When you go to a grocery store to buy a can of beans that trade requires only your consent and that of the store owner, if neither party wishes to include extra charges the trade can be morally closed without it. Thus what is happening if you tax the trade is that you are targeting one of the parties and taking their money, and this business about the theft being attached to the trade is just an excuse.\n\n \n If there is a tax on that can of beans your choice still remains the same. \n \n \n\n I have answered you many times. Since I never claimed I had a way to morally preserve these institutions if no one was willing to pay for them I am not obligated to come up with any plan to do so.\n\n \n This is where your system fails. A society of any kind cannot function without some of these necessary institutions, Not as a society. If you can't find a moral way to fund these necessary institutions then your society fails before it's started. You seem to think if you can't pay for them then just don't have them and everything goes on as normal, but remember you're building a society designed to benefit all people living in this society. \n \n \n \n\n ?????? = nothing.\n\n \n This is why the society fails.\n \n \n\n You can't change reality, if you charged everyone a 1 cent. The road is not free of charge you are just pretending that the taxes didn't pay for the road.\n\n \n By free of charge I mean not having to pay a toll every time I use this road. if you place a toll on every road at 1 cent per toll booth you would end up charging more in the long term . If I can pay a 1 cent tax out of my annual pay check and have unlimited access to all roads it's much better than paying a toll every time I leave the house.\n \n \n\n If everyone used the road and it cost 1 cent per person to build and maintain the road than there is no reason the toll would be higher than 1 cent over similar time periods.\n\n \n that 1 cent tax covers access to All roads in the community. Your way would cost me 100 times more per day just to get to work.\n \n \n\n The decisions of any group of people are valid for that group of people and no more. If it was a moral decision than the term tax would not apply.\n\n \n not under the current society that has worked for over 200 years compared to your dream world which will not work....\n \n \n\n If your community was willing to spend 1/2 cent per sale, than there is no reason to force the community to do what they are willing to do is there?\n\n \n Not everyone in the community voted for the tax, but the added revenue benefited those who did not vote as well and they use the same water system as the people who voted for the tax so they can't now say the tax was immoral. \n \n \n\n Taxation is immoral, this is why.\n Support your claim that taxes are necessary for a society to grow.\n\n \n I have, although you have so far failed to establish that taxation is immoral . All you continue to do is post the same mindless drivel and a link to the same post which is YOUR opinion and not proof of anything.\n \n \n\n That desire is what led to me searching for it, and eventually recognizing it and finally discovering it myself. That desire is why I know it now, and why I am telling you what it is.\n\n \n So you admit that this is YOUR opinion and nothing more. \" You found the answer for YOURSELF\" doesn't mean it suddenly becomes the Law of Freedom. What you've done is latched on to someone Else's Philosophy and added a bit of your own imagination and spent the last ten years trying to sell it as reality with no case study, no evidence, only opinion and speculation.

The reason a lot of companies are moving jobs overseas is because your UNIONS (with their high union wages) are jacking up the cost of goods and services to the point where they're not competitive with foreign products. In addition, another reason they're going overseas is to escape the increasing tax burdens and regulations shoved down their throats by such liberal governments as California. And that's why companies are fleeing California to get away from you flaming tax and spend liberals.\n \n \nYou have no Christian compassion for the poor, hungry or homeless.\n\n \n (Flush)\n \n \n However you are a bible believing christian and what you allow companies to do to the poor, and allow companies to throw people out of work you do to Jesus Mr Goat. \"What you do to the least of these you do unto me\"\n\n \n \"I allow companies\"...? You liberal turkeys want everything under your brown shirt control, don't you? Seig Heil!! All you need now is the mustache and some Viagra to give yourselves some self confidence.",

And of course since anyone may propose a bill a government agency can be formed to maintain and oversee infrastructure whose responsibility is to do the research and consistently propose efficient and useful bills in their area.\n \n The budget is guaranteed because support in the system refers to legally binding promises to pay what ever value is pledged if the project should pass.\n \n In a representative volitional society representatives could be vested with the power to spend a certain amount of money from each person who voted for them or otherwise agreed to the arrangement, these resources would be usable to pass bills much like above. (I hope you can see how this is redundant if we could do it the first way).\n \n In either case a government agency could acquire the funds for further projects and enhancements from tolls on current infrastructure although I think this is not a good idea. People would want to pay to maintain the road they use and be presented with the option of building more separately.\n \n The cost of new projects in general could be lumped together with a general fee for using public services as a whole. This is more like the current circumstance with taxes (except volitional), however I am strongly opposed to this not because it's necessarily immoral but because without the immoral coercion it will be a strong dissolving effect on society, in equal measure with how inflexible it is, while with something like the people system near perfect versatility is maintained, allowing participation and support of society to come from any vector.\n \n Trying to 'make' people agree on how to spend their money is doomed to failure. If you had the people system now, but tried to retain the tax code except voluntary, the first thing people would do is start fracturing into funding groups. First along the two political parties, then within the parties, then again within those; until all you have is people recognizing that they only need to agree with each other on the particular project they are trying to accomplish and not on everything they want to do with their money.",
