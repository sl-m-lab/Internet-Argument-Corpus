Or can it not be done, and it is just a useless struggle because only the one with the mind can choose to leave it open and closed?\n\n \n \n There are several tools that can be used to combat the severely stubborn and closeminded.\n \n 1.)Suggestion and interpretation is one of the most powerful tools when arguing a fanatic. It is absolutely supperlative when dealing with faith versus logic. For example: Creation versus Evolution. Creationists know that they have little leg to stand on when arguing this subject. Fanatics feel that evolution is in direct violation of bilbical law that God created man. The bottom line is that experts of biology only produce facts as a basis for their theory rather than argue it from a biblical standpoint. In otherwords, scientists don't argue in a way that biblical scholars can understand. So evolutionists must look to the bible for answers, rather than at scientific fact. Does evolution disprove God at all? No. Evolution may perhaps be God's way of creating. Adam and Eve could very well have existed and been the direct results of God's system of evolution rather than two beings that God beamed down from heaven. Their is nothing to indicate that, just because man may be a descendant of ape, he was NOT created in God's image. After all, apes are just another one of God's creations. Some argue that God created man directly, others' argue that God created the earth which gave birth to man. Either way, evolution does not suggest that there is no God or that it disproves the bible. \n \n I've done three important things in this arguement: I make the suggestion that God could exist, I offer another form of evidence, biblical translation, to those who disagree with scientific fact, and I still lobby evolution without harming anyone's beliefs. It is a win-win situation for both parties regarding this topic.\n \n 2.)Compromise is another powerful tool. I also used compromise above because I am an atheist, so it really means something when I suggest that God could exist and evolution is his form of creation. I sacrificed something of my belief in the hopes that someone else would sacrifice their beliefs to give evolution fair thought. But let's look at abortion. I am pro-life. Not because I care so much about a fetus, but because I think abortion is ignorant and breeds ignorance. However, in France, they have an abortion pill, called RU-486, they have been using it for over 10 years with a 95% success rate. Our food and drug administration won't let it in, even though it is far safer than traditional suction operations, which are often left incomplete. I believe that if abortion was made illegal, then this pill would be able to make it to the U.S. and we could be rid of the traditional method which is very dangerous and ignorant.\n \n I compromise here, I ask for your support to illegalize traditional abortion so that this newer and safer form can be adopted here.\n \n 3.)Devil's advocate. This is the most fun. I use it often. You play both sides of an arguement or perhaps realize both sides of an arguement can't win. Typically, when one side of the arguement gets an advantage, you rally for the otherside. Both parties will either hate you or appreciate your support and be apt to listening to you. If you play Devil's advocate, you should respect the position and really have some unique ideas on the topics you are rallying and be a great benefit to the arguement, rather than an annoyance. It's a coin toss, you have to know who you are dealing with when you play 'advocate'.\n \n 4.)Make friends with your enemies. They will be more apt to respect you and listen to you seriously if you have common ground in other subjects. And besides, even Canadian's have something to offer. ;)\n \n There are other formats, there is a debate format that I think is called the Rogerian format. You might want to read up on it, but it is basically a format that tries to get your audiences approval. It is partially based on finding common ground, compromising, and being respectful to your audience while slowly converting them to your side. Anyway, hope that helped. If you didn't understand what I said, let me know. I can give more examples.\n \n \n LEVIATHAN",

You cannot have a logical or rational argument without evidence.\n \n I certainly think that it is wrong to say that there is no evidence for the existence or non-existence of God. Everything and anything can be evidence. Whether you accept this evidence - it is up to you. For example, I find it absurd to suggest that this Universe \"created itself\" and that all such things happened by chance. The probability is astronomically small. That aside, you might say, \"no-one has counted the failed attempts\", but that isn't really going to work. You can't say that things \"happened before the big bang\", since empirical evidence suggests that time began when the Universe began. Time is a resultant of matter.\n \n A logical argument. I should think that Harstshorne's modal ontological argument and certain variations of it work just fine for anyone who can accept the axiom \"it is possible that God exists\".\n\n \n I thought your reply was interesting. First you agree that you cannot have a logical or rational argument without evidence by definition. Then you give an example.\n \n That example consist of your opinion that you find it absurd.

However the &#8216;calculation&#8217; you are referring to is the one referred to by many creationist that are not knowledgeable of the facts. Hoyle used just raw numbers in his calculations, not realistic combinations. I&#8217;ll give you an example. There are a little over 6 billion people in the world. So the chances that you would have sex with any one person would be 1 in 6 billion. However assuming you are a heterosexual, and knowing that approximately half the people in the world are women, that drops the realistic number to 1 in 3 billion. Further assuming that half of that number would be unacceptable to you because of youth, age, appearance, etc., that number would drop to 1 in 1.5 billion. I could go on with say location, married women, etc. but I think you will see the drift. So although technically the chances that you will have sex with any particular person in the world is about 1 in 6 billion, realistically that number is much smaller. So if you took every possible combination of molecules combining with each other, then you would get a number like Hoyle got. However molecules combine with each other only in certain ways so the actual number is not that high, although I understand it is a large number. But there are a huge number of molecules and a large amount of time.\n \n \nIt's not that I haven't provided evidence, it's that I thought you already knew.

Of course he has written several books and my memory is not that great so I could easily be mistaken. But in another book I have titled &#8216;Origins of Existence&#8217; by Fred Adams, while discussing multiple universes, which is a fascinating subject itself, he makes this comment. &#8220;Before the big bang, the concept of existence changes from that within of our universe, where objects usually exist for a set span of time. In this precosmic era our cosmic clock had not yet started and the concept of time was different from that of our universe today.&#8221; So it may well be that time has always existed, but our universe did not existed to measure it as we do today. A somewhat mind-boggling concept.\n \n \nTime does not exist beyond the human creation. If you consider the basis of time, it is very simple really. Human's concept of time is based upon the movement of the sun. (Or the earth, depending upon your relative position.) It is relevant to our perception. \n\n \n You just stated above that energy and matter are inter-linked with time. Now you are saying that time does not exist beyond the human creation. That would mean that matter and energy did not exist before the human creation wouldn&#8217;t it?\n \n \nThis concept is more aptly expressed by asking this question: Before the creation of the universe, was there time? No. Since you had no particular motion to gauge, time would not exist. Better still, does time exist for something that is immortal? \n\n \n I&#8217;m confused.

In fact it is hard to conceive that it is a closed system.\n \n What if there is enough matter in our universe to cause our universe to collapse. Then it could be a cyclic system. I realize that current evidence points towards not enough matter, but it&#8217;s far from outside the realm of possibility.\n \n \nPhysics suggests that time is a property, which is a result of the existence of matter. This comes about from Einstein&#8217;s E=Mc squared. Time is an effect from when energy is existent. Therefore, time exists when matter came into existence; time is often called the fourth dimension. \n\n \n I still don&#8217;t see the relation between the equation you are stating and time. But if you are saying time is a property, then how can your previous statement &#8220;Time does not exist beyond the human creation&#8221; allow for that property before human creation?\n \n \nI'm not, so much, urging the teleological argument in here, I think that the modal ontological argument does the job just fine. \n\n I thought we were talking about evidence, not arguments. I can argue till the cows come home without presenting any evidence.\n \nThe \"other side\"? I take it that you mean \"What's outside our Universe?\" which is a meaningless question, since it is, quite simply, nothing. There cannot be something outside of everything.\n\n \n I think you are taking the universe to include every possible thing. But when you use the big bang theory and the theory of thermodynamics, you are talking about our universe and that has definite boundaries. In other words current evidence places the age of the universe at about 12 billion years old or a diameter of 24 billion light years. If our universe started at the big bang and has been expanding for a limited amount of time, then it takes up a limited amount of space. Since the big bang theory is based on quantum mechanics, and there is no reason to believe the same thing couldn&#8217;t have happened in other parts of space, then there is no reason to not believe in other universes or even in an infinite number of universes. And all of them could have developed with different physical constants like gravity, speed of light, etc. and with totally different life forms or no life at all. Unless of course you want to propose that there is a limited amount of space. But what would be the limit? Would there be a wall or something that stops space? If so, what&#8217;s on the other side of the wall?\n \n But if you say there is an infinite number of universes, and there is good reason to believe there is, then what would the probability be that one or more formed with the conditions for life? Well the probability would be 1. Like if each person on the planet was given a number and a number from 1 to 6 billion was drawn from a hat, a large hat of course. The probability that I would be picked is extremely small. But the probability that one person would be picked would be 1. If there is a God, and I believe there is, he is so awesome that our minds can not wrap around the concept. \n \n For what it&#8217;s worth I have enjoyed having this discussion with you. It has made me think. So let me know what your comments are.",

   "But did you notice that it says 'thing or things'. That is something physical. Even when you used eyewitnesses, it is something that is seen or something physical. The broken window was physical. An opinion is not physical in any way so it's not evidence, just an opinion.\n\n thing ( P ) Pronunciation Key (thng)\n n. \n An entity, an idea, or a quality perceived, known, or thought to have its own existence. \n ~Dictionary.com\n \n Anyways, I will have to certainly disagree with you that all \"things\" are physical. Many Philosophers over the ages (namely- Russell) have held that even relations are real entities. I sure think that you can also have metaphysical \"things\". \n \nJust saying you believe something is not evidence of something. \n\n I really don't think we need to go deeply into this. I should think it to be true by definition. There are only three ways we can know things: authority, inference and experience. I'm not saying that I'm necessarily in a substantial position of authority, but it really doesn't matter. Authority is evidence for something because someone else says it is true. Even though this has been thoroughly discredited and even been given a fancy latin name, which suggests you can't rely on authority. Still, it is one of the ways that we know things.\n \n Let's take a quick example. If 5 different friends that you have, come up to you, and tell you that they think that John is stupid, that is evidence for the case that John is stupid - however useless it might be.\n \nSo if I told you that I read Peter Pan and I'm now convinced that fairies exist, you would accept that as evidence, albeit not strong evidence, but nonetheless evidence to you. Is that what you are calling evidence?\n\n Indeed, it would be. I still wouldn't trust you, because this type of evidence is the flimsiest that you can get.\n \nHowever molecules combine with each other only in certain ways so the actual number is not that high, although I understand it is a large number. But there are a huge number of molecules and a large amount of time.\n\n Well, that's some interesting information. I've been meaning to read up more on Hoyle. That was just one of the random facts I'd been granted at some time. \n \nHow does an equation that uses a constant of the speed of light squared to equate energy and mass, show that energy and mass are inter-linked with time?\n\n Okay, well - let's see. Just what is time? Time is a consequence of motion (local or global). As you know, motion is also called \"change\". This \"change of something\" can be matter, energy or space. If there is no change - then there is no time, and obviously - no motion.\n \n If you were in a completely dark abyss of space, with no light anywhere, how would you know which way is left or right, up or down, forwards or backwards? The first three dimensions are what we make them, and so is the fourth - time. All it is, is that we've organized time. Our days and years are relative to the orbit of the earth around the Sun. Time is relative to our perception. \n \nI have Hawking's book 'A Brief History of Time' and I don't remember seeing anything like that in there.\n\n Hmm, well that's weird. I haven't read the book myself, but I've read several times that he talks of it in that book. What I do know that Hawking said, (I'll try to track down the quote) is that at the beginning of the Big Bang, at that point of singularity, time and space have no meaning. At that point of singularity all physical and mathematical equations just break down. At this singularity, total area or length = 0, time=0, energy and mass density=infinite. A singularity should be viewed as a zero-dimensional object. When it is at rest - there is no time. When it moves, it starts to achieve 1-dimensional properties. \n \nYou just stated above that energy and matter are inter-linked with time. Now you are saying that time does not exist beyond the human creation. That would mean that matter and energy did not exist before the human creation wouldn't it?\n\n Well, I hope it is a bit clearer now. I explained why above.\n \nI'm confused. Are you saying that time did not exist before the creation of our universe or before the creation of man?\n\n I said: This concept is more aptly expressed by asking this question: Before the creation of the universe, was there time? No.\n \nThe second law of thermodynamics only works on a closed system. We don't know if our universe is a closed system or not. In fact it is hard to conceive that it is a closed system.\n \n What if there is enough matter in our universe to cause our universe to collapse. Then it could be a cyclic system. I realize that current evidence points towards not enough matter, but it's far from outside the realm of possibility.\n\n You're right. I don't think that the Universe is a closed system, and as you said - all evidence suggests that there isn't nearly enough matter for it to be closed. Even if the Universe is closed - it does not mean that it is a cyclic system. \n \nI thought we were talking about evidence, not arguments. I can argue till the cows come home without presenting any evidence.\n\n You could indeed. But it wouldn't convince me unless it was very strong evidence.\n \nI think you are taking the universe to include every possible thing. But when you use the big bang theory and the theory of thermodynamics, you are talking about our universe and that has definite boundaries.\n\n They are not mutually exclusive. I didn't say that the Universe is every possible thing, I'm saying that the Universe is everything. That is the definition of the Universe:\n \n u\u0095ni\u0095verse ( P ) Pronunciation Key (yn-v\u00fbrs)\n n. \n All matter and energy, including the earth, the galaxies, and the contents of intergalactic space, regarded as a whole. \n ~Dictionary.com\n \n In other words current evidence places the age of the universe at about 12 billion years old or a diameter of 24 billion light years.\n\n Well, there's something interesting. I've never heard the number been quoted as 12 million, but the actual figure is far from definite. They're quite sure that it's between 10 billion and 20 billion, but the most common figure accepted by scientists is 13.7 billion years. \n \nSince the big bang theory is based on quantum mechanics, and there is no reason to believe the same thing couldn't have happened in other parts of space, then there is no reason to not believe in other universes or even in an infinite number of universes.\n\n What do you mean by \"other parts of space\"? Other big bangs inside the Universe? It doesn't really make sense to say that something is \"outside\" of space. I know it's a tough concept to fathom, but something can have boundaries and have nothing outside it. The best example is said to think of the Universe as a sphere. If you put a 2-dimensional ant on the sphere it would go around forever, and it would be completely baffled. It's kinda the same with us. If you were to go completely straight, in the Universe, forever, you wouldn't ever reach a \"boundary\" which you couldn't go past, you'd end up exactly where you started. I think that this is because space-time bends.\n \nBut if you say there is an infinite number of universes, and there is good reason to believe there is, then what would the probability be that one or more formed with the conditions for life?\n\n I can't see any reason to believe that there is, and so far - it doesn't even seem to make sense. Perhaps you could shed some light?\n \n Nearly all scientific theory suggests that not only the Universe had a beginning (big bang) but that it is by no means infinite. Lol. It's actually quite funny to think about. If the Universe was infinite, that would mean that there an infinite amount of yous just around the Universe. And, if I were to say that the possibility of me being president isn't zero, then there must be an infinite amount of worlds where I'm president. Hah!\n \nIf there is a God, and I believe there is, he is so awesome that our minds can not wrap around the concept. \n\n I completely agree. There's a really great story to go with this:\n \nA little boy who was running back and forth between the ocean and the sand. He had a little bucket, and he was filling it up with water at the surf, and excitedly carrying it up the beach to a hole he had made in the sand. Each time, he would pour the water into the hole, and run back for some more. A couple of learned seminary professors came upon this little boy; they smiled in amusement and asked him what he was doing. He said, \"I've got my bucket and I've got that hole up there, and I'm trying to put the ocean into that hole.\" \n \n The seminary professors, those teachers of ministers, congratulated the little boy on his efforts, and they went walking on their way. Soon they started talking about some heavy subjects like the Trinity-- this is Trinity Sunday when we celebrate our understanding of God the \"three in one.\" They talked about this great mystery of the faith and how they understood God to be three in one, all at the same time. Then one of them had a great \"aha\" experience. He said, \"You know, we may know Greek and German and French, and all the Church Fathers and the Bible, but despite it all, we have about as much success fully explaining God as that little boy will have putting the ocean into that little hole he has made in the sand.\" \n \n If we could fully explain God, we would be God. Terms we use to explain God, such as \"The Trinity,\" always fall short because we are using human expressions to describe someone who is beyond our comprehension. The idea of the Trinity is something we do hold onto, because we do understand God as this unique three in one God-- but it's still a mystery. We are reminded that we cannot fully explain God, we cannot fully control God. Martin Luther, the great Protestant Reformer, put it this way: \"To deny the Trinity endangers your salvation. To try to comprehend the Trinity endangers your sanity.\" John Wesley, the great Methodist leader, put it another way: \"Bring me a worm that can comprehend a man, and I'll show you a man that can comprehend the triune God.\" It's that hard. We talk about the Trinity because it helps us understand God. We believe that Jesus came to show us who God is, and so it's appropriate that we direct our attention this morning to this final teaching of Jesus. \n http://www.firstpresby.org/bruce.htm\n\n So basically the small little hole is our minds, and the ocean is God. How could we possibly empty out all the water from the ocean, into our little minds/hole? \n \nFor what it's worth I have enjoyed having this discussion with you. It has made me think. So let me know what your comments are.\n\n Likewise. It's good to have civil discussions that aren't only prosperous for one's debating, but also for one's knowledge. Thanks.\n \n [Edited to fix typo and computer syntax]",

I don't think that the Universe is a closed system, and as you said - all evidence suggests that there isn't nearly enough matter for it to be closed. Even if the Universe is closed - it does not mean that it is a cyclic system. \n\n \n The issue of whether it is closed or not has nothing to do with how much matter is in our universe. I was simply saying that if there is enough matter for it to reverse and collapse, then although it would not mean it is cyclic, it would certainly be a strong possibility.\n \n \nYou could indeed. But it wouldn't convince me unless it was very strong evidence. \n\n \n I was simply saying you can argue without presenting any evidence as I perceive evidence. Since you believe evidence is everything, then that statement does not work for you.\n \n \nThey are not mutually exclusive. I didn't say that the Universe is every possible thing, I'm saying that the Universe is everything. That is the definition of the Universe:\n\n \n Okay let me see if I can explain. The word universe has been in use for a long time. And just like the word atom was supposed to be the smallest particle of matter that could not be divided that we now know is not true but still use the word atom, the meaning of the word universe has different meanings depending on the time frame. It used to mean our solar system, then we realized there was a galaxy out there, and then the big bang gave a compressive theory about all the matter we can see from the start of the big bang. Now when I read what scientists are talking about when they talk about our universe today, they are talking about everything that developed from the big bang. And when they talk about outside that area, they talk about other universes and sometimes even parallel universes that are not outside that area but outside the four physical dimensions of our universe.\n \n But I was simply trying to explain how I think, as I&#8217;m not interested in arguing the definition of a word in the dictionary. I&#8217;m interested in communicating which involves concepts. So we have to establish what we are talking about when we refer to things like the big bang and the universe. Since the big bang theory only addresses what we can see that began billions of years ago, I would like to call that our universe. Everything outside that would be what I would like to call other universes. But I&#8217;m open to any words you would like to use to convey the concepts. We can call the big bang matter the cosmos and everything that includes that cosmos and outside that cosmos we can call the universe if your prefer. Or any other word you would like to use. But we need to establish the concepts associated with the words so we can discuss it.\n \n \nWell, there's something interesting. I've never heard the number been quoted as 12 million, but the actual figure is far from definite. They're quite sure that it's between 10 billion and 20 billion, but the most common figure accepted by scientists is 13.7 billion years. \n\n \n Come on DW Lets not argue about something that we both know what we are talking about. I used the qualifier about when I said 12 billion years. We both know it&#8217;s based on the most recent evidence that is continuously being refined. Just like I know you meant 12 billion when you wrote 12 million. This will just distract from the real issues.\n \n \nWhat do you mean by \"other parts of space\"? Other big bangs inside the Universe. It doesn't really make sense to say that something is \"outside\" of space. I know it's a tough concept to fathom, but something can have boundaries and have nothing outside it. The best example is said to think of the Universe as a sphere. If you put a 2-dimensional ant on the sphere it would go around forever, and it would be completely baffled. It's kinda the same with us. If you were to go completely straight, in the Universe, forever, you wouldn't ever reach a \"boundary\" which you couldn't go past, you'd end up exactly where you started. I think that this is because space-time bends. \n\n \n I mean outside the physical matter caused by the big bang like I said above. The matter caused by the big bang does have a boundary or an end. But if you were to travel outside that matter there would be more space. \n \n \nI can't see any reason to believe that there is, and so far - it doesn't even seem to make sense. Perhaps you could shed some light?\n \n Nearly all scientific theory suggests that not only the Universe had a beginning (big bang) but that it is by no means infinite. Lol. It's actually quite funny to think about. If the Universe was infinite, that would mean that there an infinite amount of yous just around the Universe. And, if I were to say that the possibility of me being president isn't zero, then there must be an infinite amount of world where I'm president. Hah! \n\n \n Exactly. There is good evidence what we call our universe is not infinite. In fact we think we can estimate the diameter as we have discussed above. But that means space is outside of what we call our universe. So if space is out there, and the beginning of our universe was based on quantum mechanics, then there would be no reason that there were not other universes out there in space beyond ours that started exactly the same way.",

You are not the first to posit them. The existentialist comes to mind. However, the logic is incredibly fallible. The very act of saying there are no absolutes IS a statement of absolute. It is a universal truth that we do not know the exact nature of the universe. This is absolute. There are no holes. \n \n Your terms micro truth and macro truth, while interesting have nothing to do with truth. The definition of truth is whether or not a statement lines up with reality. If I say there is no gas in my tank and there is indeed no gas in my tank then I have spoken the truth. If there is gas in my tank, I have spoken falsely. This is the nature of reality.\n \n It is why I say your statement is a logical fallacy. While it certainly has humor I would argue it has no wisdom. \n \n The micro truths you speak of are observations. They are not devoid of interpretation as we all know that there are different shades of blue and one may say navy blue and the other say \"no just dark blue, not navy.\" Observations by their nature are not truth but statements of what is observed by the observer's perceptions. Truth is whether or not what is said lines up with reality. To say the car is red for example is only true if the car bounces wavelengths of light of the order of 630 nanometers. \n \n The macro truth you talk about is not a truth but an opinion based upon observation. A theory per se. This is not truth. The word truth has a definition. \n \n The universal truth, there are some that exist. All things are relative is not one of them. It is not a well established fact. There are some absolutes. The idea that there are not absolutes is ridiculous given that the statement \"there are no absolutes\" is in and of itself an absolute. The logical fallacy of a statement like all things are relative is obvious if one will but look. There must be absolutes. If there aren't then we would all go spinning off the globe into outer space at an enourmous velocity. There would not likely even be a predictable trajectory. \n \n I'll give you one absolute that is absolutely absolute rather than all of this abstract concept. Death. You will die. So will I. There is no stopping it. \n \n Check your thinking. Once you begin to accept the absolutes of the world, life actually gets easier.",
