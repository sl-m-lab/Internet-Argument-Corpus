   "madness spreading north?\n \n \nThe numbers of scientists staggered me--17,100 basic and applied American scientists, two thirds with advanced degrees, are against the Kyoto Agreement. The Heidelberg Appeal--which states that there is no scientific evidence for man-made global warming, has been signed by over 4,000 scientists from around the world since the petition's inception. I strongly questioned these high numbers, since I've had benefit of the Canadian government's public relations machine on this issue. Dr. Leahey has since sent documentation to back his figures up.\n \n All those scientists were in total agreement: the Kyoto Protocol was complete fiction.\n\n \n link\n \n Heidelberg Appeal \n \n and per Wikipedia",

   "Hehe... what a nice think-piece. To bad the author didn`t even bother to study the issue he wrote about (or perhaps he did, but chose to be fraudulent and lying...) :p \n \n From your link :\n \n \"....The Heidelberg Appeal--which states that there is no scientific evidence for man-made global warming, has been signed by over 4,000 scientists from around the world since the petition's inception....\" \n - Garth Pritchard, Canadafreepress.com, Saturday, May 7, 2005\n \n From your other link:\n \n \"However, the Heidelberg Appeal itself makes no mention whatsoever of global warming, or for that matter of pesticides or antibiotic-resistant bacteria. It is simply a statement supporting rationality and science.\"\n \n - Wikipedia\n \n And by consulting your third link, I could conclude that Wikipedia was correct...\n \n I also fail to see how withholding governmental grants can be called censorship.... And aparantly the broadcast companies think the movie is cr*p so they won`t publish it. And sure, the scientists can`t show the canadians because no-one is willing to air the damn thing. Is this censorship? Why should the government be expected to pay for the whole thing? Would it be censorship if the documentary I made in 9th grade didn`t get huge governmental grants and free airing during prime-time on all national channels? It`s just hyperbole...",
