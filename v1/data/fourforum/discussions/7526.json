   "Ran across this recently and noticed some similarities to \"our religion\".\n \n \n\n EXALTATION OF ZOROASTER\n Most important was the religious exaltation of Zoroaster himself. In the Gathas, Zoroaster appears as a man, listening to Ahura Mazda, talking back sometimes, but always declaring Ahura Mazda's will to humankind. In the later writings he is depicted as a supernatural being, a veritable god become man. His coming has been foretold 3,000 years previously! The demons are forewarned and quake in their impending overthrow. Not only Zoroaster's birth but also that of his mother is supernatural. Once born, the infant is attacked by the demons - and is supernaturally protected by the manifold forces of goodness. The prophet himself performs miracle upon miracle. The great miracle of the cure of Vishtaspa's horse is elaborated in detail. Every aspect of the prophet's life is fitted into a framework of popular supernaturalism - a process of which the history of religions affords numerous illustrations.\n (Paths of Faith: Fourth Edition, John A. Hutchinson, McGraw-Hill, 1991, p315)\n \n\n \n \n The parallels are not exact, but still...\n \n \nMost important was the religious exaltation of Zoroaster himself. In the Gathas, Zoroaster appears as a man, listening to Ahura Mazda, talking back sometimes, but always declaring Ahura Mazda's will to humankind.\n\n \n Sounds a bit like Moses, or Abraham.\n \n \n[Though actually a man] In the later writings he is depicted as a supernatural being, a veritable god become man.\n\n \n A god become man ... now where have I heard that before emoticon_xangel \n \n \nHis coming has been foretold 3,000 years previously!\n\n \n A god become man, with the event allegedly foretold thousands of years previously ... now where have I heard that before emoticon_xangel \n \n \nThe demons are forewarned and quake in their impending overthrow.\n\n \n Sounds a bit like some of Jesus' encounters with demons as he cast them out.\n \n \nNot only Zoroaster's birth but also that of his mother is supernatural.\n\n \n Jesus' birth was supposedly supernatural.\n \n And although Mary's birth isn't claimed to be, she is exalted by some sects of Christianity as being deserving of our worship and praise.\n \n \nOnce born, the infant is attacked by the demons - and is supernaturally protected by the manifold forces of goodness.\n\n \n Okay, I don't know of a parallel here.\n \n \nThe prophet himself performs miracle upon miracle.\n\n \n Sound anything like Jesus? Of course it does.\n \n \nThe great miracle of the cure of Vishtaspa's horse is elaborated in detail.\n\n \n Okay, no good parallel here either. Jesus allegedly did great miraculous cures, but none involving a horse.\n \n \nEvery aspect of the prophet's life is fitted into a framework of popular supernaturalism - a process of which the history of religions affords numerous illustrations.\n\n \n A process that quite well may have happened to Jesus, the man.\n \n \n In fact, it is argued by some - with some logic, though not sufficient to make their case rock solid, in my mind - that Jesus the man may not even have existed. They point out that the first gospel written was Mark, somewhere around 70 - 75 CE. That's nearly 40 years after Jesus' death. Why weren't these amazing events written down sooner? If a God appeared to you and performed all kinds of miracles, over the span of several years, wouldn't you write some of them down? If a God walked along side you and 11 of your close friends, and for years performed miracles, wouldn't one of you written something down? If a God walked among the citizens of a country - and in city after city, performed miracle after miracle - wouldn't someone have written some of them down?\n \n They go on to point out that the earliest writings we do have from Christians are Paul's letters, which fill in part of that 40-year gap, and he appears to have known nothing of Jesus' existence here on Earth, they claim. Paul apparently didn't know the later-written gospel stories of Mary's immaculate conception, Jesus' birth, the magical star that moved across the sky to guide the magi to Jesus' birthplace, Herod's attempt to kill Jesus, Herod's killing of all boys 2 years of age and under, Jesus' being baptized by John the Baptist, Jesus' being tempted by Satan, Jesus' feeding the 5,000, Jesus' walking on water, Jesus' calming the storm, Jesus' transfiguration, Jesus' trial in front of Pontius Pilate, and so on: apparently, all that Paul knew of was Jesus' crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. And these events, they claim, Paul does not place on Earth, but rather in a mythical realm.\n \n They then go on to point out how other beings - that existed prior to Jesus - were claimed to have had miraculous births, were claimed to be Gods become men, were claimed to have died and been resurrected, and so on. In fact, they quote Justin Martyr saying to the effect that people shouldn't have a problem accepting these kinds of things related to Christianity, because they are no different than what the pagans already believed. In fact, Justin Martyr goes on to say that these \"pre-Jesus Jesi\" were the work of Satan: Satan knew ahead of time that Christ would come some day, so he preemptively counterfeited Jesus several times ahead of Jesus' own birth to make people doubt the validity of Jesus when he finally came along.\n \n \n *****************************\n PS: Came back after reading this, which supports one of the statements made in the last paragraph.\n \n Reading a bit farther in the book I already quoted, I ran across this:\n \n \nThis Pauline gospel of a dying and rising savior bore unmistakable similarity to many of the Greek and Roman mystery cults which had similar stories. Paul's description of the eucharist as a Christian mystery lent further support to this view. But there were notable differences as well. (Paths of Faith: Fourth Edition, John A. Hutchinson, McGraw-Hill, 1991, p417)\n \n\n \n Well, the claim isn't that they were identical, just that they preceded Jesus and were very similar.",

   "I spent a little bit of time looking up some of what Justin Martyr said. Here is an expanded version of part of my original post relating to \"copycat\".\n \n ...\n \n They then go on to point out how other beings - that existed prior to Jesus - were claimed to have had miraculous births, were claimed to be Gods become men, were claimed to have died and been resurrected, and so on. In fact, they quote Justin Martyr (born circa 100 CE) saying to the effect that people shouldn't have a problem accepting these kinds of things related to Christianity, because they are no different than what the pagans already believed. \n \n \nCHAPTER XXI -- ANALOGIES TO THE HISTORY OF CHRIST. \n And when we say also that the Word, who is the first-birth of God, was produced without sexual union, and that He, Jesus Christ, our Teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propound nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you esteem sons of Jupiter. ... And what of the emperors who die among yourselves, whom you deem worthy of deification, and in whose behalf you produce some one who swears he has seen the burning Caesar rise to heaven from the funeral pyre?\n (Justin Martyr, The First Apology of Justin, circa 155 CE)\n \n\n \n Modern scholars recognize the similarities also.\n \n \nThis Pauline gospel of a dying and rising savior bore unmistakable similarity to many of the Greek and Roman mystery cults which had similar stories. Paul's description of the eucharist as a Christian mystery lent further support to this view. But there were notable differences as well. \n (Paths of Faith: Fourth Edition, John A. Hutchinson, McGraw-Hill, 1991, p417)\n \n\n \n Yes, there are differences, but the claim is not that the other stories were identical, just that they preceded the time Jesus is claimed to have lived, and that elements of these various \"foreshadowing\" stories were very similar to those told about Jesus.\n \n Continuing for a second on the idea of the eucharist having been 'borrowed' by Christians from earlier traditions:\n \n \nCHAPTER LXVI -- OF THE EUCHARIST. \n ... For the apostles, in the memoirs composed by them, which are called Gospels, have thus delivered unto us what was enjoined upon them; that Jesus took bread, and when He had given thanks, said, \"This do ye in remembrance of Me, this is My body;\" and that, after the same manner, having taken the cup and given thanks, He said, \"This is My blood;\" and gave it to them alone. Which the wicked devils have imitated in the mysteries of Mithras, commanding the same thing to be done. For, that bread and a cup of water are placed with certain incantations in the mystic rites of one who is being initiated, you either know or can learn. \n (Justin Martyr, The First Apology of Justin, circa 155 CE)\n \n\n \n Justin Martyr goes on to say that these \"pre-Jesus Jesi\" were the work of Satan: the devil knew ahead of time (according to Justin, from knowing Old Testament, Hebrew scriptures) that Christ would come some day, so Satan preemptively counterfeited Jesus several times ahead of Jesus' own life to fool people: to make people doubt the validity of Jesus when he finally came along and died and only second-hand stories were left to convince people.\n \n \nCHAPTER XXIII -- THE ARGUMENT. \n ... and (thirdly) that before He became a man among men, some, influenced by the demons before mentioned, related beforehand, through the instrumentality of the poets, those circumstances as having really happened, which, having fictitiously devised, they narrated ...\n (Justin Martyr, The First Apology of Justin, circa 155 CE)\n \n\n \n \nCHAPTER LIV -- ORIGIN OF HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY. \n But those who hand down the myths which the poets have made, adduce no proof to the youths who learn them; and we proceed to demonstrate that they have been uttered by the influence of the wicked demons, to deceive and lead astray the human race. For having heard it proclaimed through the prophets that the Christ was to come, and that the ungodly among men were to be punished by fire, they put forward many to be called sons of Jupiter, under the impression that they would be able to produce in men the idea that the things which were said with regard to Christ were mere marvellous tales, like the things which were said by the poets. And these things were said both among the Greeks and among all nations where they [the demons] heard the prophets foretelling that Christ would specially be believed in ...\n (Justin Martyr, The First Apology of Justin, circa 155 CE)\n \n\n \n \nFor when they say that Dionysus arose again and ascended to heaven, is it not evidence the devil has imitated the prophecy?\n (Justin Martyr, as quoted in \"The God Who Wasn't There\", Beyond Belief Media, 2005)\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n And some miscellaneous material I haven't worked into an overall context yet.\n \n \nCHAPTER XX -- HEATHEN ANALOGIES TO CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE. \n ... For while we say that all things have been produced and arranged into a world by God, we shall seem to utter the doctrine of Plato; and while we say that there will be a burning up of all, we shall seem to utter the doctrine of the Stoics: and while we affirm that the souls of the wicked, being endowed with sensation even after death, are punished, and that those of the good being delivered from punishment spend a blessed existence, we shall seem to say the same things as the poets and philosophers; and while we maintain that men ought not to worship the works of their hands, we say the very things which have been said by the comic poet Menander, and other similar writers, for they have declared that the workman is greater than the work.\n (Justin Martyr, The First Apology of Justin, circa 155 CE)\n \n\n \n \n \nCHAPTER XXII -- ANALOGIES TO THE SONSHIP OF CHRIST. \n Moreover, the Son of God called Jesus, even if only a man by ordinary generation, yet, on account of His wisdom, is worthy to be called the Son of God; for all writers call God the Father of men and gods. And if we assert that the Word of God was born of God in a peculiar manner, different from ordinary generation, let this, as said above, be no extraordinary thing to you, who say that Mercury is the angelic word of God. But if any one objects that He was crucified, in this also He is on a par with those reputed sons of Jupiter of yours, who suffered as we have now enumerated. ... And if we even affirm that He was born of a virgin, accept this in common with what you accept of Ferseus. And in that we say that He made whole the lame, the paralytic, and those born blind, we seem to say what is very similar to the deeds said to have been done by AEsculapius. \n (Justin Martyr, The First Apology of Justin, circa 155 CE)\n \n",

Now, one would think, being the supposedly non-Christian enlightened person you are, you would simply say \"oh, I didn't realize that my posts came across as anti-Christian sometimes, and that it indicates a prejudice on my part, and will try to not have prejudices in my thinking.\" I mean, one would think those of you are do this sort of thing would be happy that someone had pointed out the obvious prejudice going on, as it would be a case to help you move away from prejudicial thinking.\n\n \n Could it be because there are a large number of CHristians that keep on telling them that 'Beleive and act like I do, or burn in hell forever?\n \n It seems to me that being exposed to that kind of attitude is likely to cause a\n negative reaction to the religion at a whole. When you have people claiming that someone is immoral, and they have to change their ways, or 'go to the pit'.. it gives the entire religion a negative cast over it.\n \n So, why don't you discuss that with those are vocal , bad representiavives of Christainity first?",

Thanks for that one ... which also contradicts what was said in the movie.\n\n what movie was that again? there are quite a bit of \"scholars\" that purport the same view that paul was referring to a non-physical christ in his letters to the churches scattered all over eastern europe a few years after the date of jesus' death. its clear that they seem to skip over the passages that go against their thesis. the fact remains that evidence for paul's reference to a very physical person named jesus exists, and fortifies the gospel accounts",

   "The evolution of Christology. Is it something like this?\n \n 1) Jesus is a teacher.\n \n 2) Later, Jesus is said to have been a martyr, dieing because he held out to the very end, sticking to his teachings despite the threat of death.\n \n 3) Jesus the martyr is then said to have been resurrected, and thereby become divine.\n \n 4) Then Jesus' divinity is retro fitted to his life, by adding tales of miracles he allegedly performed.\n \n 5) Jesus' divinity is then backed all the way up to his birth, claiming he is the Son of God and born of a virgin.\n\n just think, the time gap between jesus being a wise teacher and martyr, to jesus being the son of god and conquerer of death, to jesus being a wonderous miracle worker that revolutionize jerusalem at the time he lived, was only about 40-50 years. nearly everyone who was alive to witness jesus' actual teaching would also be alive to \"buy\" the seriously embellished final biography. how could such work pass as \"factual\" enough to be recommended as scripture? couldnt the people that witnessed jesus walking around not point out the facts that the miracles added really didnt happen?\n \n it may be a case where the regular townsfolk that jesus interacted with daily were illiterate, and the scholars and writers that took the second- and third-hand accounts werent the ones that were actually there. we know that mark was not an original disciple and his work was based on relayed pieces from various sources. but how do we account for john and matthew, who were literate enough to write (or dictate) their own gospels. matthew was a tax collector so he was good at writing. and he was there all along. \n \n to me its a puzzle that cant be swept under a rug. definitely worth investigating",
