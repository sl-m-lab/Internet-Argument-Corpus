   "George Bush vs. George Soros\n I tell ya for sure America is next in the plans of George Soros for 'bringing democracy'. First it was Ukraine and Georgia, now it gonna be America. Soros has long been having grudge against our president Bush and soon he is going to take revenge after defeat of his presidential candidate John Kerry. What really makes me worry is that Soros is no more alone in his anti-Bush crusade. Last month Soros and some other American anti-Bush billionaire philanthropists (Peter Lewis, Stephen Bing, Herb and Marion Sandler and some others) met in San Francisco where they agreed to intensify struggle against the current presidential Administration and personally George Bush planning to bring him to impeachment in the measurable future. The group of American billionaires also agreed to donate even more money than they did in 2004 into anti-Bush political organizations. I guess George Soros is really a threat to American democracy. He must be stopped or his activity might split the society.",

   "George might be a evil capitalist bastard but at least he is better then George :p \n \n \n For all of George Soros's faults, I trust him more then I do George Bush's administration. Mr Soros, has already made his fortune, is reaching a ripe old age and is worried about the state the US is heading. With him being jewish and surviving the Nazi's and Soviets, and funding democratic movements throughout the world, he is a person that I would listen to when it came to world events.\n \n I might not agree with him, but I would definately give what he says full consideration. As I cant see any alterior movtive for his dislike of the Bush admin",

   "Soros is a Criminal who made his money by devaluing currency in 1st to 3rd world nations. He was convicted in France. devalued the british pound, Invests in Columbian drug cartel banks, etc. etc.\n \n I say let these XXXXXX spend thier money trying to unseat Bush.... It wont work except to pump more money back into our economies..\n \n \n In my mind Soros is nothing more than a \"High Value Target\". \n \n [quote]",
