   "If you ever wanted to see the deadly results of mixing dangerous hatemongering rhetoric, stupidity and religion, here you go.\n \n In Tampa, Florida(Of course), 21 year old Ronnie Paris Jr. is on trial for killing his 3 year old son. How did the child die? He was beaten to death. Why? Because Ronnie thought his 3 year old son was gay and was trying to beat it out of him by teaching him to box.\n \n So let me ask you. In this day in this country, why would a parent think being gay was so bad that he beat his son to death in an effort to make that not happen? I'll give you three guesses.\n \n Let's see, if all we do is tell people day after day after day that being gay is so wrong that we need to pass laws keeping them from being together and barring them from our churches and other places as well as equating homosexuality with pedophilia, incest and bestiality (thanks Rick Santorum). And we have Pontiffs pontificating on the evils of homosexuality and mobilizing everyone to fight any kind of gay friendly or non discrimination law (thanks Pope Benedict Arnold) - what the hell would you expect. Now I guarantee that no one in the establishment will take any sort of responsibility for this because as we all know it's united we stand as long as everything goes our way and as soon as it doesn't...too bad, so sad - you're on your own.\n \n Obviously this guy has problems, but I have to ask - how did he come to suspect his son was gay at age 3? Did he catch him having too much fun with the boy from across the street? Was he playing with dolls? Did he like the Teletubbies - WAAAY too much, especially that purple one? Did he start re-decorating the living room? Sing tunes from Cabaret? What was it that tipped him off?\n \n And would this go a long way to substantiate the idea that homosexuality is genetic? After all, it's not like a 3 year old can be influenced by the liberal media and their gay agenda. It wasn't like the kid was exposed to all the gay-promoting cartoons in school.\n \n But as disgusting as this story is, I guarantee that not a single person will question their fire and brimstone rhetoric and gay hating dogma for a millisecond.\n \n If you read this story a bit deeper here . One section of the article really stood out.\n \n \n \n \nNysheerah Paris told the court that Paris would make the boy fight with him, slapping the child in the head until he cried or wet himself. She said that on one occasion Paris slammed the child against a wall because he was vomiting.\n \n Wall slamming is a notoriously successful way to stop vomiting - good thinking.\n \n The court was told there had been a history of abuse by Paris. Prosecutor Jalal Harb said that in 2002, the Florida Department of Children & Families placed the child in protective custody after he had been admitted to the hospital several times for vomiting.\n \n He was returned to his parents Dec. 14. A month later he went into a coma and was rushed to hospital. Six days later he was removed from life support and died. An autopsy showed there was swelling on both sides of his brain.\n\n \n You'll notice the highlighted parts - this is the same Department of Children and Families that was so hot to save Terri Schaivo from being \"murdered\" by the evil Darth Michael Schaivo. Bang up job they did here - they gave the kid back! Way to go DCF, glad we have you looking out for people. And take a long hard look at this bit in Red. \"Removed from life support and died.\" Doesn't that mean the child was still alive on life support and when they removed it he died? How does that happen without a court fight, Jeb Bush and the U.S. Congress getting involved? What happened to the culture of life there? We vilified an innocent man, trampled on the constitution and sent jurisprudence back to the dark ages so we could keep a blind, brain-dead woman alive for no good reason, but we can't go to bat for a little kid?\n \n Sounds like...what's that word we like? HYPOCRISY!!!\n \n Boys, let's put down the dogma before anyone else gets hurt.",

Extremism has taken over so many aspects of daily life that it's a wonder the fundies havent started burning witches in the street again. \n \n An the second part, about removing the child from life support, while I supported the removal of Terri Schiavo from all those machines, it does reveal a bit oh hpocrisy that the christian rigt didnt fight this one either. I wouldn't suport moving this child off of life support after only 6 days either. To me, give the person a year, three at the very extreme, then unhook them if there are no sings of progress.",

   "There is the perception that homosexuals are a socially acceptable target. Repeatedly, when young people are asked, they will justify and defend targeting gay people as . . . There's a belief nowadays that it's not so cool to assault racial minorities. It's not so cool to assault women, or Jews. But assaulting gays is actually something humorous to a lot of young people. It's probably the last socially acceptable group to assault. Part of it is related to the fact that discrimination against gays is still legalized and encoded. That sends a message to young people that, if gays don't have equal rights in employment, housing, child custody, the military, or marriage, then there's something wrong with them, and nobody's going to mind if we have some fun at their expense. . . . \n http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/interviews/franklin.html\n \n When you conducted your studies around the Bay area, did you find the sense that gays made socially acceptable targets? \n \n I did. That was interesting, because the Bay area is a very progressive, liberal area, and I found strong endorsement for gay civil rights among my survey respondents. But I still found an overwhelming amount of anti-gay behaviors. Name-calling is especially very ubiquitous. About 70 percent of respondents said that their male friends had done name-calling. So, everybody knew people who targeted gays for at least name-calling, if not more physical acts. And again, it's not so much that the individuals harbor hatred and resentment. It's more that there's a cultural backdrop in which it's really permissible, if not very cool, to assault or harass gays. . . . One out of ten of the college students--and this is a non-criminal young adult population--said that they had either threatened or actually physically assaulted somebody they thought was a gay man or a lesbian.  http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/interviews/franklin.html\n \n What makes a person become a gay-basher?\n There's no simple answer to that question. In order to commit any kind of violent act, one has to have a propensity toward violence, probably engendered in childhood or early adult socialization. The choice of a gay target, in particular, can be based on a number of different motivation. . . . There were four over-arching motivations that most of the assaults could be boiled down to. The first one was peer dynamics, where people in groups often commit an act to prove something to peers, for example, to prove masculinity, or to prove heterosexuality, or just to not back down and let one's peers down. Camaraderie and friendship, those types of things. The next most common motivation that I found was what I called \"anti-gay ideology.\" That's what most people people think of when they think of anti-gay crimes of bias--people who have some . . . ideological motive or agenda, either religious or moral, or some kind of disgust for homosexualityhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/interviews/franklin.html",

   "First off, he was not \"teaching him to box\". He was abusing him, beating him, and eventually killing him.\n\n \n First off, you're wrong. Randal's justification was that if he taught his son to box then his son wouldn't be so 'sissy-like'. This came out in court.\n \n \n And just how do you identify a 3 year old as gay in the first place?\n\n \n \n Exactly my question. Please pay attention.\n \n \n What was he doing, listening to Elton John records and baking cookies naked with the boy next door?\n\n \n No, he was a sickly child; he would cry too easily and was physically small for his age. His father saw this as 'indicatorts' that this child was gay. I'm not defending his father's incredibly flawed reasoning. I am giving you the facts. Whether or not you CHOOSE to believe it, is up to you. \n \n \n \n Come on. The \"gay issue\" was made up in the mind of the father, not the actions and identity of the child.\n\n \n Yes, and hate crimes are made up in the minds of the perpetrators, not the victims! \n If a straight man is fired because his boss thinks his employee is \"too gay\" that falls under many states' anti-discrimination laws. (note: I did use the word \"Many\" not all or even \"most\" as this type of discrimination against sexual orientation or PERCEIVED orientation is NOT protected in most states)\n \n Hate crimes and discriminatory behavior is in the mind of the perpetrator, how that person is viewed or perceives his/her victim. \n NOT IN THE TRUTH.\n \n \n \n Do you really think that someone would kill their 3 year old child because he thought the child was gay?\n\n \n Pay attention, this is the POINT I've been trying to make. \n \n Sorry, you don't get credit for coming up with this one. \n No spinning here to make yourself seem smart, not happening.\n \n \n Does this sound like the actions of a rational person in control of their faculties?\n\n \n No, of course not. But it also does not excuse him for his actions either. \n \n \n It may show the fathers feelings towards gays, but it certainly is not a justified excuse for his behavior. I strongly suggest that this is an issue of mental illness, leading to horrible criminal behavior.\n\n \n Mental defect or illness is a legal defense intended to allow those perpetrators to not have to face the ramifications for their actions. \n What's worse is by utilizing this sort of lame defense it allows society to \"get off scot-free\" and never have to take responsibility for creating this sort of monster in the first place! \n \n \n This man should never see the light of day again.\n\n \n Try reading the ENTIRE THREAD. I've already stated this. \n \n \n I just cannot see how people are making this a gay issue.\n\n \n \n If you want to play semantics games, then no, it's not a \"gay issue\" it's an \"ANTI-GAY ISSUE!\" \n It's an issue either about one man's extreme anti-gay antics or it's a commentary about the state of society which allowed this tragedy to have occurred in the first place. Either way, it's still about the extremist mentality of fundamentalists against gays. \n You can't sweep it under the table or make light of it because it makes you uncomfortable. You can't blame something else and ignore the reality of this terrible crime!\n \n \n I certainly do not mean any disrespect, but it seems like you guys are trying to make 1+1=5. I strongly support all human rights, which include complete and equal rights for gays. I find any hate crime disgusting and deserving of severe and extreme punishment, but I just cannot get it into my head as this is a case of a gay hate crime.\n\n \n Well that's your opinion and you are entitled to it. \n Unfortunately the facts of this case and your opinion do not agree.",

This came out in court.\n\n Actually, it is Ronnie, or Ronald, not Randal. And it was not his justification, it was the testimony of his wife and her sister. You know, the same wife planning her own defense for felony child neglect.\n \n \nExactly my question. Please pay attention.\n\n No reason to be patronizing. You are above that type of behavior, or so I thought.\n \n \nNo, he was a sickly child; he would cry too easily and was physically small for his age. His father saw this as 'indicatorts' that this child was gay. I'm not defending his father's incredibly flawed reasoning. I am giving you the facts. Whether or not you CHOOSE to believe it, is up to you. \n\n First off, these are not facts. They are alleged facts based on the testimony of a few people. Second, according to my reading on this case, the child child appeared sick and malnourished because he stopped eating due to physical the abuse. Labile emotions, frequent crying, change in health and eating habits are all good indicators that a child is being abused. So what was more likely to come first here? The child just became a whining, malnourished, sick kid, and the father decided to beat him? Or, the father abused the child, and then used the symptoms produced in the child as an excuse to beat him more. \n \n \nNo, of course not. But it also does not excuse him for his actions either. \n\n I never suggested that there was any excuse for his actions. There is never an excuse for taking another innocent life. \n \n \nMental defect or illness is a legal defense intended to allow those perpetrators to not have to face the ramifications for their actions. \n What's worse is by utilizing this sort of lame defense it allows society to \"get off scot-free\" and never have to take responsibility for creating this sort of monster in the first place! \n\n So there are not mentally ill people who commit crimes? And yes, I agree that most often it is used as a lame defense, but ever so often there are people for which it is appropriate. But why does society need to take responsibility for creating this monster? Couldn't it be possible that this man was born with the propensity to kill his own child?\n \n \nIt's an issue either about one man's extreme anti-gay antics or it's a commentary about the state of society which allowed this tragedy to have occurred in the first place. Either way, it's still about the extremist mentality of fundamentalists against gays. \n\n Antics? You call killing a child antics? How sad. And let's not forget that the victim in this case is a little 3 y/o boy, not the @$$hole who killed him. You want to blame society for making him a monster...that is your choice. But how can you say this is about fundamentalists againts gays, when it is doubtful that the child could even be identified as gay in the first place. It is about 1 sick man beating a defenseless child to death, nothing more, nothing less. Not a defenseless gay child, just a child. \n \n \nYou can't sweep it under the table or make light of it because it makes you uncomfortable. You can't blame something else and ignore the reality of this terrible crime!\n\n Uncomfortable? In what way? I am trying to sweep nothing under the table. And I am seeking to blame nothing or nobody except the killer himself. You seem to be the one wanting to blame society and fundamentalist thought for this killing. The reality is that a child is dead, the father killed it, and that's it. \n \n \nWell that's your opinion and you are entitled to it. \n Unfortunately the facts of this case and your opinion do not agree.\n\n LOL. Don't you mean that it is my opinion, and only opinion, because it does not agree with your opinion, which is actually fact, and as such should be worshipped as the word of god?",
