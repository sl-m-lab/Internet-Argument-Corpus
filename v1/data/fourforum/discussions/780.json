Tell me please if anyone knows the answer..... These companies that say NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS... erm do they have good insurance policies because if your face did something very strange and unusual due to alergic reactions I'm sure that there would be complaints.

I think you would do better debating that cows shouldn't be slaughtered by the hundreds of thousands every year or that turkeys, chickens, and pigs shouldn't endure the same thing. They truely are grown in pretty bad conditions and then killed in the prime of their life.\n \n Lab animals I'm not as familiar with. You suggest that it is common for lab rabbits to have their eyes melted and are killed after this even if they manage to survive it. Now that is completely out of control if that is what happens in labs. I doubt this is the case though. What good would it do to constantly melt the eyes of rabbits? And lets not forget that it was perfume that you said was melting the eyes of the rabbit. I bet any chemist that made a perfume like that for humans has long been fired for gross incompetence. Your scenario is completely off the wall and I think you need to come up with a better one than that before you will convince a whole lot of people you are correct.\n \n \"so you think it's right for companies to cause pain and horror to living creatures because it's f*cking cheaper\"\n \n Cheaper than what? Cheaper than lawsuits or cheaper as in the cost of lives? I hope your not suggesting human lives are worth equal to or less than the life of an animal. If you are suggesting this then your a fanatic that really can't be debated with.\n \n OK I'll make a scenario for you. 1,000 rabbits need to get poked with a needle and injected with a new vaccine that will protect it against the SARS virus. 200 get SARS and die, 300 get sick, and 500 are fine. All 1,000 are killed after the tests. These test later lead to the completion of a SARS vaccine. It saves only 1 human life because SARS was so short lived but it also helped slow the expansion of the SARS virus quicker and perhaps saved hundreds of lives but only in theory. This vaccine will continue to protect humans for the rest of time against SARS but will serve no purpose beyond that. Was it worth it?",

   "whoa whoa... you DOUBT that the case i gave you was right? ok. let me explain this to you... a lot is needed. by the way, i didn't mean to seem \"pushy\".\n \n why do they use rabbit? because rabbit eyes are the closest to humans. what kind of chemicals do they randomly spray in rabbits' eyes? perfume, hairspray, shampoo/conditioner, all kinds of make-up, zit cream, etc. anything that could possible injure a person, they try first on animals (these are just testing on eyes for things we humans don't ****ing need). sounds good and decent right? did you know that animal testing before selling is not required by law either? \"but hey\", you say, \"i thought animal testing was the only way!\" no, no my little cadet. you are far, far off track. what makes you think that these tests need to be preformed on animals, or even preformed at all? they don't.\n \n animal-testing alternitives are readily available. they are cheaper (i take back the more expensive thing... techonology has pushed it forward), faster, and better at predicting whether a product is harmful or not. why isn't it widely used then? the manufacturers fear lawsuits because they don't know how well these methods work. change is hard.\n \n \"So, just what type of alternatives are in use today? The most common type of alternative methods are: in-vitro tests, computer software, databases of tests already done (to avoid duplication), and even human \"clinical trial\" tests. Use of animal cells, organs, or tissue cultures is also deemed an alternative although, obviously, animal lives are sacrificed for the use of their parts. The specific tests are:\n \n \n \n Eytex\n Produced by the National Testing Corp. in Palm Springs, California, Eytex is an in-vitro (test-tube) procedure that measures eye irritancy via a protein alteration system. A vegetable protein from the jack bean mimics the reaction of the cornea to an alien substance. This alternative is used by Avon instead of the cruel Draize eye irritancy test.\n \n \n \n Skintex\n An in-vitro method to assess skin irritancy that uses pumpkin rind to mimic the reaction of a foreign substance on human skin (both Eytex and Skintex can measure 5,000 different materials).\n \n \n \n EpiPack\n Produced by Clonetics in San Diego, California, the EpiPack uses cloned human tissue to test potentially harmful substances.\n \n \n \n Neutral Red Bioassay\n Developed at Rockefeller University and promoted by Clonetics, the Neutral Red Bioassay is cultured human cells that are used to compute the absorption of a water-soluble dye to measure relative toxicity.\n \n \n \n Testskin\n Produced by Organogenesis in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Testskin uses human skin grown in a sterile plastic bag and can be used for measuring irritancy, etc. (this method is used by Avon, Amway, and Estee Lauder).\n \n \n \n TOPKAT\n Produced by Health Design, Inc. in Rochester, New York, TOPKAT is a computer software program that measures toxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and teratonogenicity (this method is used by the U.S. Army, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Food and Drug Administration).\n \n \n \n Ames Test\n Tests for carcinogenicity by mixing a test culture with Salmonella typhimurium and adding activating enzymes. It was able to detect 156 out of 174 (90%) animal carcinogens and 90 out of 100 (88%) non-carcinogenes.\n \n \n \n Agarose Diffusion Method\n Tests for toxicity of plastic and synthetic devices used in medical devices such as heart valves, artificial joints, and intravenous lines. Human cells and the test material are placed in a flask and are separated by a thin-layer of agarose (a derivative of seaweed agar). If the material tested is an irritant, an area of killed cells appears around the substance.\n \n \n \n Today, in-vitro (meaning, literally, \"in glass\") as opposed to in-vivo (meaning \"whole animal\") has flourished because of advances in tissue culture techniques and other analytical methods.\"\n \n - taken from Animals and Alternatives in Testing - History, Science, and Ethics (sorry, i was too lazy to summarize)\n \n about me \"saying\" that human lives were lesser or equal to animals... i didn't say that, but now that you bring it up. why do you have more of a right to live than a dog? because your lifespan is longer? then what about elephants? they live longer than most humans... same with owls. i am getting into a whole other discussion, but aren't we humans destorying the planet? shouldn't we be the ones dying? anyway... i got off track.\n \n you said that any chemist than makes perfumes that would melt their eyes out would get fired?! hahahaha! how do you think these things are done? chemicals. chemicals are painful. some good-smelling chemicals can burn your eyes out. the chemist did his job, now, instead of using a computer program, the scientists grab the nearest animal, spray it all in their eyes, watch it struggle and eventually die and think \"well that didn't work...on to the next formula and rabbit.\"\n \n your scenario is useless... because 1000 rabbit do NOT need to be poked. that is my defense. animal testing is not needed. now show me why it's needed.",

   "Did I ever say I doubted that it ever happened?

Tell me, were you exaggerating just a bit here? Do you think rabbits eyes are generally melted in these tests if they are ever melted?\n \n I understand why they do these test. I also get that there are other options other than use of animals. Fine. Now which one of those products can be used to test whether my SARS vaccine works or not?\n \n \nabout me \"saying\" that human lives were lesser or equal to animals... i didn't say that\n\n \n \nAnd I, myself, believe that every living thing is equal, on some level.

It is a pretty basic and selfish principle humans hold to be true just as I'm sure you hold to be true. Would you rather see a little girl be tested on or a rabbit? I think you will find a vast majority will choose the rabbit. Even the Bible gives man the right to use animals for his own needs. Humans may be destroying the planet on some level but we are also building it up on another level. If you believe the purpose of life is to live then we are succeeding in ways no other animal has ever done. We are getting closer and closer to the ability to expand into outer space as well as defeat the affects of aging. We may even one day be faced with a catastrophic scenario where all life on Earth is threatened by an outside force and we are the only animals on this planet that could prevent the complete elimination of all life here. This is way off the beaten path but this is some incite on why I believe human lives are more important than animal lives.\n \n \nyou said that any chemist than makes perfumes that would melt their eyes out would get fired?! hahahaha!\n\n \n Yeah I bet that sounds funny. I'd laugh more at the fact that a rabbit will get its eyes melted out by perfume. I think our chemists should have a little better handle on their profession than to accidentally create acid out of perfume and even if they do this I think they will discover something is wrong when it starts eating through the clothes it is sprayed on. And yeah, I'd fire that guy.\n \n I also think your being pretty dramatic on how happily the scientist and chemist burn the rabbits eyes out and watch it struggle and die.\n \n Now have you ever actually seen this happen? Have you ever worked in a place like this? Have you heard stories from people who work in places like this where rabbits eyes are commonly melted? If not, what are you basing this on anyways?",

   "Animal testing must be limited to as little as possible, and eventually be eliminated.\n \n\n \n Just so I don't misunderstand what you mean, I was wondering if you can clarify some points.\n \n What is as little as possible? Just cancer research? Just neurophysiology research? No cosmetic research but all medical researches are ok?\n \n Eventually eliminated means what? Absolutely no animal testing should be done, but you will allow some time for people to begin to stop using animals?\n \n \n\n Testing for medical reasons, which should still be an absolute minimum, is one thing. Testing for cosmetics and household products is another. \n \n\n \n Okay, I agree. Obviously, there is a seriously important dichotomy here.\n \n \n\n Every single year, millions of animals die in painful tests in order to determine the \"safety\" of cosmetics and household products. Rabbits, guinea pigs, dogs, and other animals are tested despite the fact that test results do not help prevent to prevent human illness. These tests are NOT necessary. More than 500 manufactures of cosmetics and household products have chosen not to use animals for testing. These companies take advantage of the many alternatives to testing, which includes cell cultures, tissue cultures, corneas from eye banks, and sophisticated computerized models. \n \n\n \n I think it's true to say that there is a lot of testing by private companies on animals that just isn't necessary. A lot of people would agree this probably shouldn't be done, and I think I take that position. \n \n On the other hand, there is also a lot of of public research done on animals as well. Public research, here, refers to researches funded by the US government -- NIH, NSF, etc (or government of other countries, although I know less about those). These follow strict animal usage guidelines, but regardless, they do require a lot of animals. \n \n Just to name some specific examples, on the order of thousands (this is my guess, so I don't know what the numbers are, but I think these are reasonable numbers) of cats and monkeys die for neurophysiology research per year. The number of rhesus monkeys that die for AIDS research per year is probably much higher now because there is a large impetus for the government to pour money into AIDS research.\n \n Among other things, public research using animals should consider two principles:\n 1. is the experiment necessary? (i.e. is the data already available, and is the result important to the general scientific understand of something)\n 2. will the animal be in pain? aside from some pain related researches, all animals should be anesthetized (or locally anesthetized).\n \n I think that a more important question to ask is: what do we do about this sort of pubic animal research?\n \n This is a more important question because, after all, the researches are funded by your tax money, so you are, in some sense, responsible. Furthermore, I think that a lot of people would agree that just picking a squirrel down the street and beating on it for fun is just not a nice thing to do -- and probably similarly for privatized research of the type you mentioned.\n \n So what about public research? Should it be eliminated?",

   "you're right, i actually meant out of the smaller animals, but i guess not everyone is clairvoyant.\n \n when you talk of medical research, i see your point, and i would be a hypocrite to do almost anything health-related, although i believe we should do a bare-minimum in animal testing and persue the equal and better means of testing through the alternatives above.\n\n \n I agree with you for the most part. The hard part about it is that there is some medical research, drug research for example, that cannot be done on tissue samples in a test tube. Drug research involves not only observing the effect of the drug on the target tissue or target cells, but observing the effect on all tissue and systems of the body. It is important to understand that drugs effect ALL tissues in the body (unless entry is prevented as in the blood brain barrier). Say for example: Morphine. Morphine is a narcotic pain reliever. It works by binding to the opiate receptor sites in the central nervous system. Well that's all well and good, but why can't I give it to someone with a really low blood pressure? Well, because it causes relaxation of vascular smooth muscle thereby decreasing systemic vascular resistence and increasing venous capitance, at the same time it is allowing the heart to slow and relax, decreasing total cardiac output by means of stroke volume and rate. This is just the effect on the cardiovascular system. Imagine all the other things it does in the body. Things like this are important to discover prior to using the drug on an unsuspecting patient in an emergency. So yes, I agree that if at all possible, and the results are the same or better, use testing that does not kill animals. But, people need to realize that there are many types of testing, and many of them must be done on living organisms with the same relative organ structure as humans (this is why we can't use grasshoppers).",

   "whoa whoa... you DOUBT that the case i gave you was right? ok. let me explain this to you... a lot is needed. by the way, i didn't mean to seem \"pushy\".\n \n why do they use rabbit? because rabbit eyes are the closest to humans. what kind of chemicals do they randomly spray in rabbits' eyes? perfume, hairspray, shampoo/conditioner, all kinds of make-up, zit cream, etc. anything that could possible injure a person, they try first on animals (these are just testing on eyes for things we humans don't ****ing need). sounds good and decent right? did you know that animal testing before selling is not required by law either? \"but hey\", you say, \"i thought animal testing was the only way!\" no, no my little cadet. you are far, far off track. what makes you think that these tests need to be preformed on animals, or even preformed at all? they don't.\n \n animal-testing alternitives are readily available. they are cheaper (i take back the more expensive thing... techonology has pushed it forward), faster, and better at predicting whether a product is harmful or not. why isn't it widely used then? the manufacturers fear lawsuits because they don't know how well these methods work. change is hard.\n \n \"So, just what type of alternatives are in use today? The most common type of alternative methods are: in-vitro tests, computer software, databases of tests already done (to avoid duplication), and even human \"clinical trial\" tests. Use of animal cells, organs, or tissue cultures is also deemed an alternative although, obviously, animal lives are sacrificed for the use of their parts. The specific tests are:\n \n \n \n Eytex\n Produced by the National Testing Corp. in Palm Springs, California, Eytex is an in-vitro (test-tube) procedure that measures eye irritancy via a protein alteration system. A vegetable protein from the jack bean mimics the reaction of the cornea to an alien substance. This alternative is used by Avon instead of the cruel Draize eye irritancy test.\n \n \n \n Skintex\n An in-vitro method to assess skin irritancy that uses pumpkin rind to mimic the reaction of a foreign substance on human skin (both Eytex and Skintex can measure 5,000 different materials).\n \n \n \n EpiPack\n Produced by Clonetics in San Diego, California, the EpiPack uses cloned human tissue to test potentially harmful substances.\n \n \n \n Neutral Red Bioassay\n Developed at Rockefeller University and promoted by Clonetics, the Neutral Red Bioassay is cultured human cells that are used to compute the absorption of a water-soluble dye to measure relative toxicity.\n \n \n \n Testskin\n Produced by Organogenesis in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Testskin uses human skin grown in a sterile plastic bag and can be used for measuring irritancy, etc. (this method is used by Avon, Amway, and Estee Lauder).\n \n \n \n TOPKAT\n Produced by Health Design, Inc. in Rochester, New York, TOPKAT is a computer software program that measures toxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and teratonogenicity (this method is used by the U.S. Army, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Food and Drug Administration).\n \n \n \n Ames Test\n Tests for carcinogenicity by mixing a test culture with Salmonella typhimurium and adding activating enzymes. It was able to detect 156 out of 174 (90%) animal carcinogens and 90 out of 100 (88%) non-carcinogenes.\n \n \n \n Agarose Diffusion Method\n Tests for toxicity of plastic and synthetic devices used in medical devices such as heart valves, artificial joints, and intravenous lines. Human cells and the test material are placed in a flask and are separated by a thin-layer of agarose (a derivative of seaweed agar). If the material tested is an irritant, an area of killed cells appears around the substance.\n \n \n \n Today, in-vitro (meaning, literally, \"in glass\") as opposed to in-vivo (meaning \"whole animal\") has flourished because of advances in tissue culture techniques and other analytical methods.\"\n \n - taken from Animals and Alternatives in Testing - History, Science, and Ethics (sorry, i was too lazy to summarize)\n \n about me \"saying\" that human lives were lesser or equal to animals... i didn't say that, but now that you bring it up. why do you have more of a right to live than a dog? because your lifespan is longer? then what about elephants? they live longer than most humans... same with owls. i am getting into a whole other discussion, but aren't we humans destorying the planet? shouldn't we be the ones dying? anyway... i got off track.\n \n you said that any chemist than makes perfumes that would melt their eyes out would get fired?! hahahaha! how do you think these things are done? chemicals. chemicals are painful. some good-smelling chemicals can burn your eyes out. the chemist did his job, now, instead of using a computer program, the scientists grab the nearest animal, spray it all in their eyes, watch it struggle and eventually die and think \"well that didn't work...on to the next formula and rabbit.\"\n \n your scenario is useless... because 1000 rabbit do NOT need to be poked. that is my defense. animal testing is not needed. now show me why it's needed.\n\n \n \n I guarantee every \"alternative method\" you quote here started with animal testing. It is all moot. Animals do not, by any stretch of the imagination, equate to human life. If we discontinued animal testing for cosmetics, millions of people would be out of jobs. Our economy would take a nosedive, becuase we are a shallow people. We have to \"look good\", we have to have designer this and brand name that.

LOL I did use cleaners that had been tested at some point to ensure that I was safe and so were my pets!

I have not researched those at all.\n \n I do agree with medical reasons for animal experiments. We would not be alive for as long as we are without them. However, on the grounds for cosmetic use I agree with these as well to a point. I may appear to contradict myself here so please bear with me. I do believe that we have enough eyeshadow, mascara etc. The companies do not now need to test too much with regard these products. However if they bring out a new 'keep looking younger' cream - I would hope that it had been tested in some way so that when anyone rushes out to buy it they are safe and do not have all their skin fall off. With regards to skin grafts etc - (people in fires, bomb blasts, shootings, car accidents) I do think that if by testing they can improve the 5 year old boy/girls face then test away. If they can get a person a fabulous new leg then test away. If they can cure MS (excuse spelling - Multiple Scherosis not sure if that is right) then test away. Heart transplants test away. Severe scarring test away. This may sound harsh but I believe that it is a necessity. \n \n You have all put so much research and knowledge into your answer that I am extremely inferior in that respect.

   "I'm sorry but I think that animal experiments are cruel and pointless. They use these poor animals for for testing substances including chemicals, weedkillers and pesticides. These animals are also used in medical research , in an attempt to find the cause of, and treatments for, human disease. But animal experiments are unreliable and can be dangerously misleading because animals bodies are different from ours, and they dont get the same diseases that we do. Thousand of chimpanzees have been used in useless experiments \n to find a cure for AIDS, seen AIDS will kill us but it wont kill chimpanzees. Drugs affect animals differently then humans. Drugs such as aspirin,commonly\n used to treat humans, are highly poisons to cats. Alexander Fleming, who discovered penicillin, first thought that penicillin wasn't any good because he tested it on a rabbit first and the rabbit died. It was years later when in desperation he gave it to a human patient that he discovered that it killed infection in humans.In the UK, vivisection is controlled by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, which states experiments can only take place if the expected benefits to humans outweigh the animals' suffering. In practice though, it allows experiments for almost any reason, such as testing food additives, weapons, tobacco products and alcohol. And in reality, no animal experiments help people because the information obtained is unreliable. The scientists like to keep their experiments secret and the Act encourages that - in fact, someone working in a lab can be imprisoned for two years simply for exposing what takes place! Animals are damaged and killed to test the safety of new agricultural and industrial chemicals, food additives, household cleaning products and cosmetics. They are force fed substances, they have chemicals rubbed into their skin or dripped into their eyes and they are made to inhale smoke or toxic fumes to see how poisonous they are. New drugs and surgical techniques intended for people are first tested on animals. They are also surgically damaged, given cancer, infected with viruses, brain damaged and injured in other ways in an attempt to recreate human diseases. Animals are also fed addictive substances in order to study addiction. Time and time again animal experiments have failed. In fact, studies of the predictability of animal experiments consistently show them to be worse than random guess work. These experiments are stupid and pointless.
