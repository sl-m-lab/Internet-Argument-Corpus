   "http://www.alternet.org/story/22135/\n \n \n. . . .Finally, I'm not sure of the exact numbers, but approximately 28,000 women in this country each year become pregnant as the result of a rape. That's a huge number and it occurs all over America. Here is the question that we must raise: should the federal government force a woman to bear the child of her rapist?\n \n By denying a rape victim access to family planning, to contraception, and to medical operations to end a pregnancy, the conservatives are, in effect, in favor of forcing rape victims to bear the children of their rapist. In Colorado, for example, the governor recently vetoed a bill that would have permitted rape crisis centers to inform rape victims of the effectiveness of the morning-after pill. Now this kind of counseling is the very minimum that a rape crisis center ought to be doing for rape victims. This is an outrage. This is an outrage against victims of rape who ought to be protected, not further exploited. . . .\nGeorge Lakoff is the author of Don't Think of an Elephant: Know Your Values and Frame the Debate' (Chelsea Green).

No one should have to care for her if they don't want to. However, there is an extremely large gap between not providing care for her, and forcing her to carry a baby to term. In fact, the two are completely unrelated.\n \n The same with your neighbour analogy. There is no correlation between your obligation (or lack thereof) to provide a duty of care for him, and any right you may have to kill him.\n \n A woman is pregnant. She refuses to care for the baby. The baby is removed, and since it is too young to survive, it dies.\n \n A similar analogy would be:\n \n A person comes across an injured person in the street. They refuse to give aid to the injured person. As a result, the injured person dies.\n \n It would NOT be:\n \n You come across a person in the street, and decide to kill them.\n\n \n \n If you and I were rock climbing and we had an accident, which resulted in you dangling off a ridge with your only lifeline being my leg, which you managed to grab in the accident, do I have the automatic right to remove you from my leg, which would send you to your death? The justification being, you are restricting my freedom to walk away. Remember, I have the right to control mine own body.",

I object to it when they have sex first, then decide to rid themselves of their son or daughter.

The person that hired the man can be charged with murder.\n \n \nThe rock climbing analogy works like this:\n \n Two people climbing the rock face = The baby living inside the mother.\n \n One falls, and manages to cling to the others leg = The baby depends 100% on the mother for life.\n \n The person whose leg is being clung to decides not to let the other person hang on, and lets them fall to their death = The mother decides to not let the baby use her body, and lets the baby die.\n The reason I don't like the analogy is because of the first part. The baby is always 100% depending on the mother and the mother is the reason the baby is there. You would have to start the analogy by saying you brought your friend rock climbing and you told him to hang on to your leg while you climbed the rock. (the women has sex and now has a baby that is 100% depending on the mom). The climber decides he doesn't want his friend hanging on his leg anymore so he says get off...the climber falls and dies. (abortion).\n \n Now this thread is about rape so we can modify the example for rape. This would be to say that someone else that was on the rock came by and attached his friend to your leg while you are climbing the rock. Now you have 2 people but it a bad situation because of someone elses selfishness. What do you do? I think you still can't cut the person away. Since (with rape) there is no human life in danger (normally) I believe cutting the person away would be wrong. In our example it would be the climber that was forced to have someone hanging on his leg being securly on the mountain with 0% chance of slipping and falling himself.",

I think of a man from Galilee, a carpenter's son who spread the message of repentance and forgiveness and showed His finest by hanging on a Roman cross. Meanwhile, God the Father poured out all of His Divine wrath and judgement upon this innocent carpenter. Yep, I'm talking about Yeshua. \n On the second issue, yes it is the government's right to recognize the heterosexual, monogamous marriage as the only legitimate place for the sexual relationship. Reason being is to ensure that the family unit remains strong. I have stated in another thread that humans just will not accept the moral absolutes given in the Word of God. This does not surprise me. Paul wrote that the natural man does not receive the things of God because they are foolishness to him. Nor can he understand them, for they are spiritually discerned. You see, Bell , God designed the sexual relationship not just for pleasure, but also for procreation. Like fire, it can bring incredible blessing and satisfaction. However, also like fire, it can also burn you if it is mishandled. That is why God placed such restrictions on sexual conduct. Fornication(for which I am guilty of), Homosexuality, Adultery, etc. are all out of God's will, and therefore sin. God designs things to go a certain way. If we deviate from this, then we end up in a world of hurt. However, God also forgives :) Remember the Jewish carpenter from Galilee, God poured out all of His wrath upon Him. That is how we are able to have a relationship with an awesome God who made you, numbered the hairs on your head, knows and understands your fears, hangups, concerns, etc. and longs to call you His child. I guarantee this; On the day you allow Christ into your life, the angels in Heaven are going to throw a party in your honor :) \n And BTW, PP's main thrust, their main bread and butter is abortion.",

It's like living your life based on the Harry Potter series or something. \n \n Jitobear, what can I say? You are eloquent and perfectly state my opinons.\n \n I especially liked \"women need to be taught that they can be valuable humans and single\". Telling women to wait until marriage to have sex is a throwback to days of dowries. She's only worth anything if her virginity is intact. My [insane] parents found out I had sex. I was nineteen, and dated a very respectable boy for two years. Suddenly I lost all value in their eyes. \"My life was ruined forever\" \"I would never have a valuable marriage or relationship\" \"I was a whore/slut/et cetera\". Then they kicked me out of the house, refusing to speak to me to this day.\n \n Is this the kind of education you have in mind, Bassman?",

This seems different then what you stated in this thread regarding the government deciding whether or not a girl under state care can have an abortion.\n\n \n Once again you making assertations for me. I actually think the government should bugger off period. Unless the person is the ward of the state it should be up to the individual, their medical providers, and their care-givers - not the government.\n \n Regarding 13 year old girls - frankly I think they should abort as I strongly believe they are too young to be able to supprt a healthy pregnancy - physically or mentally, however it would be up to the girl and her family. Unless she is is in an abusive situation - then different actions should be taken - and what that would look like would have to depend on the situation.\n \n \nYou can kill a conjoined twin and have it removed. \n This is from a conjoined twins website\n http://www.conjoined-twins.i-p.com/\n Now do you wish to explain to me why Alice is wrong in her thinking?\n\n \n This situation is so odd, and I am too far from it, to frankly have an opinion. I do not know.\n \n \nSo it has nothing to do with my age then? I guess you have a right to be 'ticked off' but I get ticked off about abortions...so fair enough.\n\n \n I am ticked off because you are putting words in my mouth and attempting to use pro-life propaganda to paint me as some sort un-feeling witch. I am a single mom. I work my butt off. I love babies. I work with the mentally ill.\n \n But I also live in an underpriveleged neighborhood and know the realities or rape, dead beat men, parenting, and pregnancy - FIRST HAND. You can be pro-life - many people I know and love are. But not one of them insults me or puts words in my mouth the way you have in your last several posts directed at me. \n \n My pro-choice stance is born of my life experience. It is not because I am reckless, uncaring monster. So knock it off.",

So because of this the only way would be to kill the person...is this ok?\n\n \n I can see your reasoning, in that the only possible result of abortion is the death of the baby, thus the only way to remove the person from the house should be by their death, but just as important as the end result are the steps that get us there. The baby dies because it is unable to survive outside the womb, which makes the issue not about when it is acceptable to kill people, but instead makes it about duties of care. To my mind, especially in the case of rape, the mother has no duty of care to the baby, and is fully within her rights to remove it.\n \n My stance comes, I think, down to this:\n \n No one owes anyone else a duty of care, unless they willingly accept that duty (for example, a fireman or ambulance officer are expected to help people. Civilians on the street are not). If someone wishes to renege on a duty of care, they should take all reasonable steps to ensure someone else assumes that duty of care (putting an unwanted child in welfare services, for example). I most certainly do not consider a pregnancy to be a reasonable step.\n \n The points where I believe you disagree are:\n \n 1 - The duty of care. I'm not sure what your stance on this issue is, but I know it differs from mine.\n \n 2 - Pregnancy. You consider it a reasonable step to ensure someone else can assume the duty of care for the baby.
