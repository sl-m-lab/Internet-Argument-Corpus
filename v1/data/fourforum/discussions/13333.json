   "She had such beautiful expression and wisdom in her voice that only seemed to deepen with time. They brought folk music to so many audiences, and the body of work they produced is enormous. I think they are also to be greatly credited for bringing so much folk music to children. They were (are, as well, since Peter and Paul are still alive) very generous as musicians.\n \n I remember being in a park once as a child and Paul was there with his guitar. He just started playing and singing for all the kids there. All the kids wound up there, dropping all else they were doing, sitting on the grass, listening to him perform. Talking about the music and songs too. He was also quite a teacher.\n \n The photo from the first link is all 3 of them at the 1963 March on Washington when Dr. King gave his I Have A Dream speech. I think Mary was also involved in the voter registration drive down south. I think of her, too, as a feminist. She was a strong and opinionated and inspiring woman who spoke her mind out on issues when others were reluctant to. Some looked at her and saw this gorgeous willowy blonde and thought there was nothing else going on. But anyone really listening to her sing, this strength and spirit and spunk belted out, could see that she was quite a principled and brave person, a lot of character, a thinking individual. Very encouraging and supportive of others, a quality I think increasingly out in her music, over the years.\n \n Here, you can see it, too in her rendition of the Hammer Song (I think it's the Newport Folk Festival). \n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUKB3PxG-0E&feature=related\n \n The New York Times ran an obituary, but I thought they really did a poor job summarizing her contributions, didn't really appreciate the history or person or music there, and were even a little nasty (e.g. they qualified the music as \"commercial\", etc).\n \n Some people wanted Mary to go into a closet when she got older and ill and when she was no longer their sex symbol. But Mary obviously knew she was a person, not a thing. She never stopped fighting and she never accepted the shallow definitions that others were imposing upon her, and then, as a middle-aged or older woman, and having gained weight. She was a self-disciplined and trained artist and kept reflecting that self-perception in her music, to anyone who knew how to listen to what was there on a deeper level. She kept speaking her mind and developing and deepening the artistry in her expression. She always carried herself with dignity, even more so in later years.\n \n They're so tight and connected in their performance together, as a group, at Newport. I reminded of how some jazz musicians do it up. It's just beautiful.\n \n Anyway, I see Mary Travers as an inspiring figure in music also. (And the New York Times can go jump in a lake.)",

   "Back in 1963 or early 1964 I was a teenager working at the Atlantic Richfield station at the corner of Desert Inn Rd. and Maryland Pkwy in Las Vegas. Around 6 PM or so (could have been Saturday) a long, black limo pulls up. The right rear window rolls down and I'm looking at Peter, Paul, and Mary. Mary was in the middle in a mini skirt and long legs, with her long blonde hair and she looked really good. It was either Peter or Paul who asked directions to UNLV. They must have had a concert there that night. \"Down Maryland Pkwy about 1 mile on the right,\" I said. I wanted to hop in there with them. And there they went, down the highways of their lives. It was a moment in time. One moment she looked young, and great, and had wonderful times ahead of her. Now she's gone. Time goes by so quickly.\n \n Edit: Here's a link with a picture: http://celebrating50.unlv.edu/timeline.html\n \n It was 1963\n \n I wonder what Mary's religious beliefs were? I can't find anything on the internet. Does anyone know?  I know either Peter or Paul is a Christian but I'd like to know what Mary thought.\n \n My favorite song of theirs is \"Early Morning Rain.\"",

That's why I liked what Laura Bush said in that interview, that she was a feminist. It was a very Nixonesque moment in the Nimoy sense (only he could go to China). But she understood that problem with the language and addressed it very well, probably because of her teaching background. But people don't credit her enough as a woman either. She's a very inteliigent person, for example (even though I'm quite at odds with a lot of her politics, since she's a contemporary Republican). That's the real heart of these matters.\n \n Anyway, have a good weekend, Winston. I'll see you again for more Femmes Violent (?) youtubes.",
