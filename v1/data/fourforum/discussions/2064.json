   "Physician, heal thyself.\n\n \n Mizmaxx: If the situation in this thread were reversed, and Mathurin and I were two black men going off on how whites are racist and oppressing our people and that justice demands that they rid themselves of their evils ways, would you have responded to them with a \"Physician, heal thyself?\" The fact is that the minority community started this bitch-fest, and after decades of being called every name in the book (much of my post-secondary education was a sermon about how evil I was; I concluded the greatest service I could do for the good of humanity was to shoot myself in the head) we are only defending ourselves and arguing that you are mistaken in accusing us; your problems are not primarily caused by us. If you will not see that, we will have to show you. \n \n Of course, the typical response to this is that ALL possible double standards are allowed the victims. Being a member of a group that has been treated unfairly endows you with a virtue no others can share. Being a victim allows you to make the ugliest accusations whenever you feel like it, but the accused are forbidden from responding or defending themselves. The only moral course allowed a white after being called a foaming-at-the-mouth hater his whole life is to find a quiet place to do some hard self-reflection in order to heal the demons within.",

   "ok, i never said they should assimilate, give up all culture\n \n however what is currently happening is tantamount to joining a country club then walking around telling all the members that you arent a rich white guy like all the other members\n \n i live here in kansas, you know, bible belt area, you dont have to tell me about conservative folks, i live among racist insensetive persons, they thrive on pointing out how well treated minorities are by the government, at our own expense. folks around here cross state lines because the KKK is illegal in kansas (if it went to court then it would get put down, but no one has the guts to challenge it) a 13 loop noose is illegal because of all the lynchings that used to happen.\n \n however you know the real reason why people like me get angry about the way minorities act, like they are untouchable. cause there is nothing we can do about it, any attempt to speak out brands one as a racist, and if one isnt a racist and thus grouped with racist groups you become vulnerable to attacks by the minorities you are protesting, threats, physical abuse, and property damage. even if the culprit is ever caught nothing much happens to them, it either cant be proven or a sympathetic jury lets them off (after all, the defense would paint the assailant as a victim of a vicious racist) which in effect makes these people as untouchable as they feel, heightening the tension\n \n what i want is equality, nobody gets college money, or positions based on anything racial, i remember when affirmative action was abolished in california, a black leader led a march along the golden gate bridge protesting what he called \"a step backwards in civil rights\" since when do you have a right to better educational facilities, i cant afford a big college, so i dont see why these folks are whining, i go to a small college, ill get my degree and send my kid on ahead of me\n \n one instance was just brought to mind, a part indian kid i used to work with, his father was a drunk, he was working fast food to support 2 kids, now even in the tiny town i live in $6 an hour is not enough to feed and clothe a family, so they get government assisted housing, he didnt like me, in his eyes i was succeeding cause my parents are rich (they arent, my father worked at a printing press for 27 yrs to send me to school) in my eyes he was making excuses for being a lazy bum (he also drank and smoked marijuana alot) why didnt he bite the bullet and get an industrial or construction job for $20 an hour your kids could have the chance at college you didnt\n \n oh, and i havent mentioned reparations, we reparations are simple for me, if you can point to the person (not the distant descendant) who was dealt the injustice then sure, pay them, and example would be the living holocaust victims, but if i wanted rome to pay me money because 2k yrs ago the romans slaughtered and captured alot of germans, well youd call me daft\n \n i prolly should reread this post, but i got another or 2 to write\n Mathurin",

True Afirmative Action may end up biting the occasional person in the rear, bu considering that they were walked all over for centuries, well can we suck it up just a bit here? \n\n Your argument that minorities are at an advantage because of the racial history of the U.S. and therefore deserve preferences is just pure theory. Two quick sets of facts easily refute such a claim. First, many immigrant groups have surpassed the income of average Americans. Chinese-, Japanese-, and even the more recent Korean-Americans make higher than average incomes. Jewish Americans on average make double the income of other Americans. Not only are these minority groups, most have not been Christians, another traditional basis of discrimination. Blacks and Hispanics may be non-white, but they do not have the obstacle of religious discrimination like these other groups. Moreover, these groups and Hispanic also have faced the obstacle of not speaking English, a obstacle not experienced by blacks. Yet all these non-English speaking groups have done better economically than blacks. ALL of these facts contradict your view that racism keeps groups down.\n \n The second set of facts is more controversial. Let me quote my comments from other threads: \"Our race hysterical culture makes it very difficult to speak frankly these days, but the incessant accusation by many blacks and white liberals about how evil whites are can only be borne for so long. As whites passed the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights, they decided they hadn't gone far enough to be nice, so they even imposed upon themsleves legislation that would discriminate against their own children in college admissions and job positions so folks who had been treated unfairly could have more opportunities. In spite of this willingness to move one's children aside for others, their efforts were not appreciated; in fact, the accusations of wickedness have only gotten louder and more shrill than ever. \n \n Well even nice people can only be pushed so far; at some point we begin to say enough niceness; now it's time to tell the real truth about why American blacks are not as wealthy as American whites. The average white is not doing well because some black guy picked cotton for no wages 200 years ago. The uncomfortable truth is that we live in a modern, complex society where income has become very dependent on cognitive abilities, and absolute bullet-proof research shows that American blacks, on average, score 15 points lower on cognitive tests than average American whites. Of course, when someone mentions this uncomfortable fact, either we try to distract attention from the facts by demonizing the messenger, or the vain attempt is made to refute the research. \n \n I won't bore you with all the proof; you folks are smart enough to look into the research (if you want to read a book that will make a man (or woman) out of you, read the g Factor by Arthur Jensen). But just to give you a taste of the proof, a common criticism of IQ tests is that they measure white culture, something black naturally wouldn't test as well at. Well if that is true, why does the average black score an 85 on a non-verbal IQ test that is based on pictures, while the average citizen of China who makes less than $1000 a year score 100 on the test? The average Chinese person has absorbed more white culture than the average American black? \n \n It is no fun to bring up uncomfortable facts that are uncomplimentary of others, but when whites are constantly demonized for black poverty, at some point they are forced to tell truth and can no longer let unattractive facts just remain secret in the research lab.\"\n \n And: \"Where minorities are most concerned about racism is in the area of income and advancement in the workplace. I'm short on time now and can't give a detailed response, but Linda Gottfredson (http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredso...ietalconseq.pdf) has shown that for black and whites, IQ very effectively predicts where you end up in the workplace. Sure, you have white bigots out there (most are lower income people not in charge of hiring and promotion), and you have race preferences as well working the other way. Gottfredson's research implies the two offsetting forces cancel each other out, and what explain lower levels in the workplace among blacks is lower average IQs. All jobs has minimum IQ requirements, and the higher the minimum, the fewer the percentage of blacks with the required IQ. No one can be a competent doctor without a minimum IQ of, say, 115, yet only 2.5% of blacks have IQs at least this high, compared to 16% of whites, and about half of all Askenazic Jews.\"\n \n \n\n People who come to this country to live indeed should make an effort to learn the language. This, however, takes time. Ever become fluent in a language other than English? Any idea what is involved? Many immigrants will not come knowing the language as the resources to learn it are not readily available in their native countries. My ex-husband only received four years of school - period. I could read and write Spanish better than he (he is from Mexico). Also bear in mind that that individual in your store may be a tourist. Either way, they are contributing to our economy - and that is a good thing.\n \n\n On the immigration issue, people always focus exclusively on the benefits. I suppose by \"contributing to the economy\" you have foremost in your mind that most work at hard jobs for low-wages. Agreed. But people forget that on the other side of the ledger, a greater supply of cheap labor lowers the number of jobs available to poor people born in the U.S. and it drives down their wages as theare are so many people around who will work for cheaper. Mass immigration hurts blacks and poor whites (not to mention professional people too like in the high tech industry). People also forget that poor immigrants put a heavy burden on taxpayers, without paying much taxes, as they receive governement assistance in many forms (emergency health care for example) at greater rates than others, and they are incarcerated at higher rates as well. You mention how hard it is for people to learn English, but let's not forget the other side of it--it is hard in terms of taxpayer dollars to educate non-English speakers. \n \n \n\n It was also implied that diversity/non-asimilation is devisive. That is only true if you are unwilling to embrace something, learn about something different than yourself. My company walks it's talk regarding diversity. We have networks and events that talk about all kinds of culture and religions. We have people from all over the world at work, and I love learning about how they do things, what they believe, what they eat. Diversity provides more options - more people and ideas to pick from. For the record I work for one the largest, oldest and most succesful companies in the world. We are brand name that is recognized and respected everywhere. We know how to do business.\n \n I am not saying there are no whiners out there. There sure are. But it's not racial. And wanting justice, opportunity, and identity is not whining. \n \n Want to know who is really annoying whiner? A white guy complaining that he faces discrimination.\n\n This thinking is typical of why I am arguing is the wrong direction American culture has been taken in recent years. You argue that if diversity is divisive, it is so only because the mainstream doesn't adapt enough to other cultures. In other words, the mainstream is the cause of the problem. This is like my inviting a guest to come and stay in my house, but he likes to run the house differently than I do. We start arguing about how things are going to go in the house, and he begins to claim that the only reason we are having a conflict is that I won't change the way I run my house for him. If a guest said this, it would be the height of arrogance on his part, but in topsy-turvy America, the homeowner is supposed to cowtow to the guest. \n \n And this is a totally \"feel good\" idea that diversity is vital to any organization. Does Japan, one of the great cultures of the world, seem to suffer from having too many people similar to each other? Diversity in the form of restaurants or entertainment adds spice to life, but nobody recognizes that, more importantly, heterogeneity has throughout history been a terrible, never-ending cause of turmoil. For example, research shows that one cause of a country having a higher murder rate is ethnic diversity. At least 10% of American homicides are due to ethnic conflict. Riots, revolutions, civil wars, and international wars have very often been ethnic. Difference breeds conflict--it is almost a universal law.",
