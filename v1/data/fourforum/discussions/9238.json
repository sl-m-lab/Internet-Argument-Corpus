   "This is a big week.\n \n Tuesday will see the release of existing home sales as reported by NAR. Regional releases indicate this figure will fall for an eighth consecutive month. Inventory will continue to swell.\n \n Wednesday brings new home sales as reported by the Census Bureau. Another decline is expected, but lower median prices have kept the volume out of 'shocking' territory. Shocking will come in the spring of 2007.\n \n The house price index (HPI) is released by OFHEO on Thursday. This quarterly report will be the most significant because the third quarter was the beginning of real trouble. The southern areas will probably moderate the overall conclusion, but take a look at the report to see how bad things are in California, Nevada, Arizona, Florida, Virginia, Washington, and other hot markets. This is a great report that deserves lots of attention.\n \n Triple witching in the housing market!\n \n \"Triple witching hour is the final hour of the stock market trading session on the third Friday of every March, June, September, and December. Those days are the expiry of three kinds of derivatives,\n \n Stock index futures \n Stock index options \n Stock options \n \n The simultaneous expirations often set off heavy trading of options, futures and the underlying stocks, which can cause large fluctuations or volatility in the value of their underlying (housing) stocks.\"\n \n Jeff",

   "True Home Value Growth\n \n The recent run up in home prices has been widespread and unprecedented in the US. We have experienced isolated residential bubbles in the past, but we've never experienced such systemic growth. However the growth has been largely concentrated in markets that were relatively expensive before the bubble, i.e., Florida, DC region, California, the Southwest and the Northwest. This has significant implications.\n \n The Home Price Index (HPI), published quarterly by OFHEO, was recently released for the third quarter of 2006. This index is more robust than any other measure of home values due to the manner in which it is calculated and the number of data points. Assessing the HPI data leads to yet another worrying conclusion about the true growth in home values.\n \n I'll use a measure I'll call the True Value of Growth. It captures the relative dollar volume of growth that is missed by the simple HPI data. For instance, the HPI might grow 5% year-over-year in both Iowa and Californie, however the 5% growth in California represents more than double the dollar value of 5% growth in Iowa. This is because California homes are generally 2.5 times more expensive than homes in Iowa.\n \n I calculated the Total Value Growth for HPI data from 1975 to the third quarter of 2006. The graph below shows the trend. The average Total Value Quarterly Growth was 1.9% from 1975 through 2002 (prior to the current bubble). This means that all 50 states plus DC grew an average of 1.9% per quarter, but the 1.9% is standardized based on each state's baseline HPI value of 100 (1st quarter of 1980). Therefore this measure captures the relative differences in home price values. Although difficult to see, the small dotted line represents the average Total Value Growth of 1.9%.\n \n (The graph can be seen here: http://home-economics-us.blogspot.com/)\n \n This graph highlights the value growth of US homes. Not only have relatively expensive markets experienced silly growth, but that silly growth was magnified by the already inflated prices in those markets. The serious implication is that the downside risk is not fully explained by the simple HPI measure. The impending fall in home prices will be magnified just as the recent increases were magnified. The potential for lost equity is magnified, and the potential for economic harm is also magnified.\n \n The recent trend in Total Value Growth speaks for itself. It will likely fall into negative territory during 2007. The quarterly measure has entered negative territory just 5 times since 1975, and each instance lasted just one quarter. Two instances occurred during the stagflation of the early 1980's, and three occurred during the various real estate recessions in the 1990's. Each of those inflationary periods was fractional compared to today's bubble. This correction will require several quarters of negative Total Value Growth.\n \n Jeff",
