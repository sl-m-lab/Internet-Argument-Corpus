Why would god want to punish us with death when hell awaits us??\n \n I would submit it is a god of death, destruction, vengence, wrath, and blood sacrifice, not really anything I can relate to !!!!\n\n i think the answers given are equally valid. first of all, death is something that has been with around since life began. man, rather than see death as part of nature and move on, ponders the reasons and purpose of death, especially since it causes so much grief and sorrow. nothing can bring back that which is dead, but man would like to think otherwise. so man convinces himself that death is not the permant end of their loved ones, but that it is just his loved ones moving to a more pure and pristine place. this gives man hope in the face of death, and allows him to deal with his grief. in fact, the belief and hope of the afterlife may well have been a contributor to the survival of his species. a grief burdened early man would have developed into a sickly and unfit species\n \n of course the uknown element of death, as well as natural disasters and spectaular phenomenon, would birth the concepts of the forces of good and evil, forces both beyond the control of man, and with universal power and influence. nothing could stop or control these forces, but these forces seemed to be in control of everything around man. truly anything at all that happened outside of man's deliberate action was either the work of the force of good or of evil. evntually god and the devil were born as representative characters of good and evil. and of course if you wanted more good than evil in your life, it was in your best interest to focus your thoughts on good rather than evil. this was true then as it is today, but somehow focusing your mind on good got translated into worshipping god and performing elaborate rituals and religious acrobatics in order to get god's favor. and obviously if you didnt you'd reap the reward of the devil.\n \n hmmm...",

   "THE SUN DARKENED AT NOON\n \n Circa 750 B.C.\n \n According to Amos 1:1, Amos prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah, king of Judah (767-739 B.C.), and Jeroboam, king of Israel (782-753 B.C.). The name \"Amos\" is derived from the Hebrew term meaning, \"lift a burden,\" or \"burden-bearer\" (note Isaiah 9:4, speaking of the coming Messiah as one who would carry our burdens, and also Matthew 11:28). His calling by God was to foretell of pending judgments upon a number of surrounding nations, and particularly of a coming judgment upon Israel. As is common with other Biblical prophets, along with the promise of impending judgment, God also gave Amos a glimpse of events that would soon occur in the life of the coming Messiah, though the significance of what was prophesied may or may not have been made known to Amos. And so it is in the Old Testament book of Amos that we find a prophecy that for many centuries was looked upon with wonder and curiosity:\n \n \"'In that day,' declares the Sovereign Lord, 'I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight....I will make that time like mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.'\" (Amos 8:9-10)\n \n It probably wasn't until the day of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in 32 A.D. that the prophecy of Amos took on clarity and meaning, for in Matthew 27:45 Jesus had just been nailed to the cross when the Bible records:\n \n \"From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.\"\n \n Just as the \"Star of Bethlehem\" marked the birth of Christ, so now God brought forth another celestial miracle to pronounce His death. This prophecy is one of those that is beyond the control of mortal man, and as such it dispels the theory that Christ could have manipulated events so as to make it appear that He was the Messiah. But is there any evidence that this really occurred? Did the sun go dark at noonday? In his book, Evidence That Demands a Verdict (Volume 1, pages 81-87), Josh McDowell provides the following historical evidence that what took place at Calvary was more that just fanciful mythology:\n \n Concerning the Samaritan-born historian Thallus, circa 52 A.D: (The writings of Thallus no longer exist, yet were alluded to by the historian Julius Africanus, as follows): \"Thallus, in the third book of his histories, explains away this darkness as an eclipse of the sun - unreasonably, as it seems to me - unreasonably, of course, because a solar eclipse could not take place at the time of a full moon, and it was at the season of the Paschal full moon that Christ died.\"\n \n Likewise, Africanus wrote concerning the writings of another first century historian by the name of Phlegon: \"....during the time of Tiberius Caesar an eclipse of the sun occurred during the full moon.\" \n \n Phlegon is also mentioned by the historian Origen in his work, \"Contra Celsum,\" book 2, sections 14, 39, and 59: \"Phlegon mentioned the eclipse that took place during the crucifixion of the Lord Christ....and this is shown by the historical account itself of Tiberius Caesar.\" Apparently at one time there were historical accounts of the strange darkness that came over the land that were kept in the official archives of Tiberius Caesar, though they are likely lost to history.\n \n Finally, the 2nd century Roman born jurist and theologian Tertullian referred to a Roman archives report of an \"unexplained darkness that took place during the reign of Tiberius Caesar, as can be seen in the archives of Pontius Pilate.\"\n \n The darkness spoken of in the book of Matthew occurred between noon and three P.M. in the afternoon (from the sixth to the ninth hours, as the Jews were noted as referring to the sixth and the ninth hours of daylight). Note that a solar eclipse will take less than an hour to complete, and a total solar eclipse lasts just a few minutes. This, coupled with the fact that a solar eclipse cannot occur during a full moon (the moon would be on the 'other' side of the earth), provides further evidence that what occurred was something other than an eclipse of the sun. Just what it was no one can say for sure, just that from recorded historical sources there was a strange darkness during the time of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. From God's perspective, it surely was a time of mourning for His only begotten son. \n \n Jesus once said, \"I am the light of the world.\" So it shouldn't be surprising that during his death there might be a time of darkness over the land.\n \n REFERENCE:\n \n McDowell, Josh.

   "BTW, the author of Isaiah identifies the Suffering Servant as Israel. He makes it quite clear that Israel is the suffering servant among the nations.\n\n \n <chuckle<\n \n The servant of Isaiah 53 is an innocent and guiltless sufferer. Israel is never described as sinless. Isaiah 1:4 says of the nation: \"Alas sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity. A brood of evildoers, children who are corrupters!\" He then goes on in the same chapter to characterize Judah as Sodom, Jerusalem as a harlot, and the people as those whose hands are stained with blood (verses 10, 15, and 21). What a far cry from the innocent and guiltless sufferer of Isaiah 53 who had \"done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth!\" \n \n When did Israel suffer and not open her mouth (v. 7)? Are you suggesting that Jews have never complained about their oppression? That doesn't match history either. \n \n When was Israel cut off from the land of the living (v.8)? \n \n When was Israel assigned a grave with the rich (v.8)? \n \n When can we say that Israel did no violence (v.9)? Isaiah chapter 1, verse 15 states, \"Your hands are full of blood.\" They also went on a violent tear under the leadership of Joshua, etc., etc. \n \n When did Israel bear your iniquities (v.11)? Specify the time of such an event. How does the Jewish nation bear your iniquities? \n \n Again, here's what the ancient Rabbis said concerning Isaish 53 (they weren't buying your argument either):\n \n Rabbi Moses Alschech(1508-1600) says:\n \"Our Rabbis with one voice accept and affirm the opinion that the prophet is speaking of the Messiah, and we shall ourselves also adhere to the same view.\"\n \n Babylonian Talmud: \"The Messiah --what is his name?...The Rabbis say, The Leper Scholar, as it is said, `surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him a leper, smitten of God and afflicted...'\" (Sanhedrin 98b) \n \n Midrash Ruth Rabbah: \"Another explanation (of Ruth ii.14): -- He is speaking of king Messiah; `Come hither,' draw near to the throne; `and eat of the bread,' that is, the bread of the kingdom; `and dip thy morsel in the vinegar,' this refers to his chastisements, as it is said, `But he was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities'\"\n Targum Jonathan: \"Behold my servant Messiah shall prosper; he shall be high and increase and be exceedingly strong...\"\n \n Zohar: \"`He was wounded for our transgressions,' etc....There is in the Garden of Eden a palace called the Palace of the Sons of Sickness; this palace the Messiah then enters, and summons every sickness, every pain, and every chastisement of Israel; they all come and rest upon him.

Evidence That Demands A Verdict (Vol. 1). Thomas Nelson\n Publishers. Nashville. 1972.\n\n \n \n Oh yes.. the 'africanus' con. The problem is that we don't have the actual words from Thallus. We just have a vague reference from Africanus in an unfinished short essay. Thus, it is impossible to say what thallus said, or even if the soloar eclipse that Thallus described was anywhere near the time period\n that is alledged for the cruxificition. Nor can the fact that phlegion be made at that same time period. We do know that solar eclipses are a natural pheneomn. It take the worst kind of assumptions and misreading of that to try to insist that it was a miracle that happened in anywhere from 29 to 33 CE.",

   "Until Shiloh Comes - By Chuck Missler (From his Book \"The Creator Beyond Time and Space\") \n \n In the 49th chapter of the book of Genesis there is another specific prophecy regarding the time of the Messiah's coming. \n \n \"The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh comes; and to him shall be the obedience of the people.\" Genesis 49:10 (NKJ)\n \n This strange prophecy has a few words that need to be defined in order to be fully understood. The word \"scepter\" has been understood by the Rabbis to mean the \"tribal staff\" or \"tribal identity\" of the twelve tribes of Israel. This \"tribal identity\" was linked, in the minds of the Jews, to their right to apply and enforce Mosaic law upon the people, including the right to adjudicate capital cases and administer capital punishment, or jus gladii (The jus gladii is a legal term which refers to the legal authority to adjudicate capital cases and impose capital punishment.) \n \n Secondly, it is well documented that the word \"Shiloh\" has been understood for millennia to be an idiom for the Messiah. Therefore, according to this prophecy, the tribal identity or scepter of the tribe of Judah would not cease until the Messiah came. Judah was not only the name of the son of Jacob, but it was also the name of the southern kingdom of the divided nation of Israel. \n \n With these definitions in place we can restate the prophecy as follows: \n \"The [National identity of Judah, which includes the right to enforce Mosaic law, including the right to administer capital punishment upon the people, as called for in the Torah] shall not depart from [the southern kingdom (Judah) ], nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh [the Messiah] comes; and to him shall be the obedience of the people.\"\n \n This prophecy gives specific indicators regarding the time of the coming of the Messiah! The prophecy declares that he would come before the right to impose Jewish law (which includes capital punishment) is restricted and before the national identity of Judah is removed! \n \n During the 70-year Babylonian captivity, from 606-537 B.C., the southern kingdom of Israel, Judah, had lost it's national sovereignty, but retained it's tribal staff or national identity.2 It is very significant that in the book of Ezra we read that during the 70-year Babylonian captivity the Jews still retained their own lawgivers or judges.3 The Jews maintained their identity and judicial authority over their own people even during 70 years of slavery. The scepter had not been lost during the Babylonian captivity. \n \n During the next five centuries the Jews suffered under the yoke of the Medo-Persian, Greek and Roman Empires. Yet, Judah retained its tribal identity up until the first quarter of the first century A.D.\n \n In the first quarter of the first century A.D., the Jews were under Roman domination when an unprecedented event occurred. According to Josephus (Antiquities 17:13) around the year A.D. 6-7, the son and successor to King Herod, a man named Herod Archelaus, was dethroned and banished to Vienna, a city of Gaul.4 He was replaced, not by a Jewish king, but by a Roman Procurator named Caponius. The legal power of the Sanhedrin was then immediately restricted.\n \n With the ascension of Caponius, the Sanhedrin lost their ability to adjudicate capital cases. This was the normal policy toward all the nations under the yoke of the Romans. The province of Judea had, however, been spared from this policy up to this point. However, Caesar Agustus had had enough of the Jews and finally removed the judicial authority from them at the ascension of Caponius. This transfer of power was recorded by Josephus.5 \n \n \"And now Archelaus' part of Judea was reduced into a province, and Caponius, one of the equestrian order of the Romans, was sent as a procurator, having the power of life and death put into his hands by Caesar!\"(Emphasis added) \n \n The power of the Sanhedrin to adjudicate capital cases was immediately removed. In the minds of the Jewish leadership, this event signified the removal of the scepter or national identity of the tribe of Judah!\n \n If you think that this is a Christian contrivance, think again. Here are several ancient rabbinical references that indicate that the rabbis believed that Genesis 49:10 was referring to the Messiah. \n \n In the Targum Onkelos it states: \"The transmission of domain shall not cease from the house of Judah, nor the scribe from his children's children, forever, until Messiah comes.\"6 \n \n In the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan it states: \"King and rulers shall not cease from the house of Judah...until King Messiah comes\"7\n \n The Targum Yerushalmi states: \"Kings shall not cease from the house of Judah...until the time of the coming of the King Messiah...to whom all the dominions of the earth shall become subservient\"7\n \n In the Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 98b, Rabbi Johanan said: \"The world was created for the sake of the Messiah, what is this Messiah's name? The school of Rabbi Shila said 'his name is Shiloh, for it is written; until Shiloh come.'\" \n \n The Messiah had to come by this time, and Jesus did.",

   "WHAT THE ANCIENT JEWISH RABBIS SAID about Daniel's prophecy of the Messiah in Daniel chapter 9:\n \n Christianity has its roots in Judaism, and accepts the Old Testament (the \"Tenach\" in Hebrew - an acronym for the Old Testament Scriptures consisting of the Torah, Prophets, and Writings) as the divine word of God. Today, many Jewish Rabbis try to deny the messianic application of Daniel's prophecy. However, it is well established in history that ancient Jews believed Daniel's prophecy pinpointed the time of the Messiah's coming. For instance, in the Babylonian Talmud, complied between 200 - 500 A.D., Rabbi Judah (the main compiler of the Talmud), said concerning Daniel's prophecy:\n \n \"These times were over long ago.\"\n (Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 98b and 97a)\n \n In the 12th Century A.D., Rabbi Moses Ben Maimon (Maimonides), one of the most respected rabbis in history, and a man who rejected Jesus as the Messiah, said:\n \n \"Daniel has elucidated to us the knowledge of the end times.\n However, since they are secret, the wise (rabbis) have barred\n the calculations of the days of Messiah's coming so that the\n untutored populace will not be led astray when they see that\n end times have already come but there is no sign of the Messiah.\"\n \n In addition, Rabbi Moses Abraham Levi said regarding the time of the Messiah's coming:\n \n \"I have examined and searched all the Holy Scriptures and have\n not found the time for the coming of Messiah clearly fixed, except\n in the words of Gabriel to the prophet Daniel, which are written\n in the 9th chapter of the prophecy of Daniel.\"\n \n In the Targum of the Prophets, in the Tractate Megillah 3a, the Rabbi Jonathan ben Uzziel noted, concerning Daniel's prophecy:\n \n \"The date of the Messiah was foretold in it.\"\n \n Rabbi Elias, who lived 200 years before Jesus, wrote:\n \n \"The world endures 6000 years; Two thousand before the law\n (before Moses), two thousand with the law and two thousand\n with the Messiah.\" (Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 96b - 99a)\n \n \n Grotius quotes Rabbi Nehumias, (who lived in the generation preceding the birth of Christ) as saying, \"Whoever the Messiah is, he must appear within the next fifty years.\"\n \n \n REFERENCES\n \n Eastman, Mark, and Smith, Chuck.

Hatach is another name for the <b<prophet Daniel</b<. He was called Hatach (related to the Hebrew word for \"cut\") because he was \"cut down,\" demoted from his position of greatness, which he held at the courts of the previous kings (Megillah 15a).\n \n http://www.virtualpurim.org/scripts/tgij/paper/IndexPurim.asp?ArticleID=1436&Cat=Megillah\n \n Jewish Rabbi Moses Abraham Levi identifies Daniel as a prophet:\n \n \"I have examined and searched all the Holy Scriptures and have not found the time for the coming of Messiah clearly fixed, except in the words of Gabriel to the prophet Daniel, which are written in the 9th chapter of the prophecy of Daniel.\" \n \n The great Jewish Rabbi Maimonedes identifies Daniel as a prophet:\n \n From Maimonede's Sixth Principle of Faith: \n \"Third, when a <b<prophet</b< receives prophecy, even though it was only a vision and by means of an angel, he would nevertheless be weakened by it and his body would shudder. He would be stricken with a very great fear almost to the point that his spirit would leave his body, as <b<Daniel</b< said when [the angel] Gavriel (Gabriel) spoke to him, \"No strength remained in me; my robustness changed to pallor, and I could retain no strength... and I was in a deep sleep upon my face, and my face was to the ground\". And as he says later, \"during the vision my joints shuddered and I could retain no strength\". (Daniel 10:8-9, 16). But Moshe, may he rest in peace, was not so, rather, the word came to him and he did not experience trembling and shivering in any way, as it says, \"And HaShem spoke to Moshe face to face, as a man speaks to his friend\" (Shemos [Exodus] 33:11). In other words, just as a man does not experience trembling from the speech of his fellow, Moshe did not tremble from the word even though it was face to face. This was due to his total attachment to the intellect, as we said earlier.\" \n \n Jesus confirms Daniel is a Prophet\n \n The Lord Jesus Christ spoke of Daniel \"the prophet\" (Matthew 24:15; Mark 13:14). \n \n Was Daniel known prior to Trebor's alleged 2nd Century B.C. date?\n \n Alexander the Great and Daniel\n \n JOSEPHUS [Antiquities, 11.8.5] mentions that Alexander the Great had designed to punish the Jews for their fidelity to Darius, but that Jaddua (332 B.C.), the high priest, met him at the head of a procession and averted his wrath by showing him Daniel's prophecy that a Grecian monarch should overthrow Persia. Certain it is, Alexander favored the Jews, and JOSEPHUS' statement gives an explanation of the fact; at least it shows that the Jews in JOSEPHUS' days believed that Daniel was extant in Alexander's days, long before the Maccabees. \n \n \nGeneses 49:10-11 are not about the messiah.\n\n \n Wrong.

LOL!\n\n \n EZ, you're wandering all over the field. The subject under discussion is Isaiah, and in particular, chapters 41 through 54 including the Servant Songs, and I'd like to confine the discussion to that particular topic. But first, a bit of background...\n \n The book of Isaiah is considered to be a composite work with at least two and more probably three authors. Scholars have identified them as First Isaiah (chaps. 1-39), Second Isaiah (chaps. 40-55), and Third Isaiah (chaps. 56-66). The demarcations are made based upon considerations of differing literary styles and historical timeframes. First Isaiah is pre-exilic, Second Isaiah is exilic, while Third Isaiah is almost certainly post-exilic. The servant songs are contained within Second Isaiah. \n \n The thrust of Second Isaiah is the Babylonian exile of Jews, and the author was probably one of those exiles. The author mentions Cyrus of Persia several times. You will recall that it was Cyrus who liberated the exiled Jews from Babylonian captivity and allowed them to return to Israel. The author identifies Israel as God's servant and the suffering of this servant is almost certainly an allusion to the exilic period which included the destruction of Jerusalem and the deportation of a considerable number of Jews to Babylon. The author goes on to say that God would eventually redeem the servant (Cyrus' decree of Jewish liberation from Babylon allowing for the return of Jews to Israel, the reconstruction of Jerusalem) and that God would reward the servant with \"seed\" (future generations) as well as a prolonged life. The author further stated that these developments would serve to convince the Gentile nations of the power of the god of Servant Israel. \n \n Sources:\n The NRSV Study Bible, Harper Collins Pub.\n The Anchor Bible Dictionary, Doubleday Pub.\n The New Jerome Bible Commentary, Prentice Hall Pub.",

   "Where's your evidence anything was deliberately doctored?\n \n \n \nThe discrepancies between the different gospels. The arguments put into Jesus' mouth based on later Greek mistranslations, since cleared up, not the Hebrew Bible he knew. The totally twisted nature of the beginning of Matthew (claiming to fulfill the prophecy of birth from a virgin, based on a mistranslation of the Hebrew 'young woman' and at the SAME TIME trying to make Jesus a son of David through Joseph, and screwing up the genealogies in the doing of it, sending Jesus running from one place to the next with unhistorical censuses and unhistorical slaughter of innocents).\n\n \n Sorry, those are incorrect arguments. First, the Gospels are complimentary, not contradictory. Second, there was no mistranslation of Matthew's Virgin Birth prophecy as you claim. Third, many scholars have looked into the genealogies and found no problems of the sort you claim.

I don't think you even know what they are.\n \n \n \n Horse dung.\n \n Was Daniel considered a prophet?\n \n The \"Prophet Daniel\" found in the Dead Sea Scrolls:\n \n Daniel 12:10 is found in the Florilegium (4Q174 - Dead Sea Scrolls), and identifies Daniel as \"Daniel the Prophet\".  \n \n The Talmud refers to Daniel as a Prophet i.e. \"Hatach\". Hatach is another name for the <b<prophet Daniel</b<. He was called Hatach (related to the Hebrew word for \"cut\") because he was \"cut down,\" demoted from his position of greatness, which he held at the courts of the previous kings (Megillah 15a).\n \n http://www.virtualpurim.org/scripts/tgij/paper/IndexPurim.asp?ArticleID=1436&Cat=Megillah\n \n Jewish Rabbi Moses Abraham Levi identifies Daniel as a prophet:\n \n \"I have examined and searched all the Holy Scriptures and have not found the time for the coming of Messiah clearly fixed, except in the words of Gabriel to the prophet Daniel, which are written in the 9th chapter of the prophecy of Daniel.\" \n \n The great Jewish Rabbi Maimonedes identifies Daniel as a prophet:\n \n From Maimonede's Sixth Principle of Faith: \n \"Third, when a <b<prophet</b< receives prophecy, even though it was only a vision and by means of an angel, he would nevertheless be weakened by it and his body would shudder. He would be stricken with a very great fear almost to the point that his spirit would leave his body, as <b<Daniel</b< said when [the angel] Gavriel (Gabriel) spoke to him, \"No strength remained in me; my robustness changed to pallor, and I could retain no strength... and I was in a deep sleep upon my face, and my face was to the ground\". And as he says later, \"during the vision my joints shuddered and I could retain no strength\". (Daniel 10:8-9, 16). But Moshe, may he rest in peace, was not so, rather, the word came to him and he did not experience trembling and shivering in any way, as it says, \"And HaShem spoke to Moshe face to face, as a man speaks to his friend\" (Shemos [Exodus] 33:11). In other words, just as a man does not experience trembling from the speech of his fellow, Moshe did not tremble from the word even though it was face to face. This was due to his total attachment to the intellect, as we said earlier.\" \n \n Jesus confirms Daniel is a Prophet\n \n The Lord Jesus Christ spoke of Daniel \"the prophet\" (Matthew 24:15; Mark 13:14). \n \n Was Daniel known prior to Trebor's alleged 2nd Century B.C. date?\n \n Alexander the Great and Daniel\n \n JOSEPHUS [Antiquities, 11.8.5] mentions that Alexander the Great had designed to punish the Jews for their fidelity to Darius, but that Jaddua (332 B.C.), the high priest, met him at the head of a procession and averted his wrath by showing him Daniel's prophecy that a Grecian monarch should overthrow Persia. Certain it is, Alexander favored the Jews, and JOSEPHUS' statement gives an explanation of the fact; at least it shows that the Jews in JOSEPHUS' days believed that Daniel was extant in Alexander's days, long before the Maccabees. \n \n \n \n Wrong. Even some Jewish Rabbis said it was Messianic (see my prior post for their quotes, blind guide).\n\n \n \n Daniel might have been a prophet, but the BOOK of daniel was a psuedograhical work written down in the second century. All but the most conservative red neck evangilaical scholars will admit that.",
