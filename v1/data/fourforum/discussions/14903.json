   "The Associated Press Updated 12:00 PM Wednesday, January 12, 2011\n \n BUCYRUS, Ohio - A bus carrying members of a college wrestling team has collided with a state snowplow in Ohio, killing a 52-year-old athletic trainer on the bus.\n \n The State Highway Patrol says the University of Mount Union bus was in the far right lane and passing the left-lane plow late Tuesday on U.S. 30 in north-central Ohio's Crawford County.\n \n Daniel Gorman of Hartville was pronounced dead at a hospital. The university identified him as director of athletic training and associate professor of human performance and sports business.\n \n Troopers say four people were treated for minor injuries, including a 19-year-old wrestler and the head coach.\n \n The snowplow driver wasn't hurt. The bus was returning to the school in Alliance after a meet.\n \n Several inches of snow had fallen.\n\n Is this going to turn political?is the President going to call for a moment of silence?Go on t.v. to talk about highway and road conditions and what can be done to make them safer? Will bus drivers(and snowplow) have to under go a more intense\n training course?Will snowplows be banned(or at least strongly regulated)?Or will this just be the end of it because there wasn't a firearm involved?\n This death will go unnoticed except by family,though this just happened chances are we will never even know the names of those hurt.",
