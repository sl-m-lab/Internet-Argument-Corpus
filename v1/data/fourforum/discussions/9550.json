   "In a recent thread, I think some interest was expressed in a discussion of the United States Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113). If I am mistaken as to the depth of this interest, I apologize. But I do believe that a discussion of Roe is quite important to a discussion about abortion in the United States. And it is for this reason that I decided that Roe deserves its own thread.\n \n Before going further, I wish to say something to those who reside outside of the United States. It is not uncommon in this thread for a person to point out that such-and-such only applies to the United States or some similar objection. This thread will really only apply to those residing in the United States, although I certainly would like to invite our European friends to participate if they would like to. I just want to say up front that I have intended to restrict this particular thread to an issue that probably only has significance to United States citizens.\n \n I would now like to explain my proposed methodology in this thread. Though I am not a moderator and possess no ability to ensure this thread goes forward in my intended manner, I will nevertheless express my hopes for this discussion. This thread is intended to proceed much in the same manner as a debate in the \"formal debate\" thread would proceed, with a single exception: the attitude (atmosphere) in this thread will be more of a discussion as opposed to a debate. As such, many posts might be longer than the average for the general forums. \n \n I intend to post a systematic treatise (of sorts) on Roe v. Wade. This will be done in a series of posts, and I invite questions/comments/discussion at whatever juncture would seem appropriate in the series. I do not know how frequently I will be able to add to my discussion (i.e., the longer posts), but I will try to respond to questions and/or comments whenever appropriate (i.e., in shorter follow-up posts). I have at least two reasons for starting this thread, and I will end this first post with a short explanation of those reasons.\n \n First, I believe this will be beneficial to many that contribute to the Abortion forums. Many times we focus all of our attention on our personal view of abortion (which I do believe is important), but we spend very little time on whether those personal views actually matter. I will explore this in greater detail in a post to follow. Secondly, even if nobody else is interested in this discussion, I will nevertheless benefit myself by engaging in the exercise of trying to articulate some foundational principles of Constitutional law. I have a deep personal interest in Constitutional law, and discussing some of the specifics surrounding that discipline will in the very least benefit my own understanding.\n \n I have one final thought. I do hope that this discussion will be of interest to all those who feel so strongly-one way or another-about abortion. That may be an ambitious desire, but I hold it sincerely. Please do offer any comments/questions/disagreements you may have with this (but especially future) posts in this thread. I look forward to this important discussion.\n \n ***[Update]***\n \n I have kindly been given moderator privileges for this thread. This will enable the discussion to move forward, and will hopefully prevent it from moving too far off topic.\n \n ***[/Update]*** ",

   "In my previous post, I suggested that one reason I started this thread is that it seems we spend a great deal of time discussing our personal view of abortion (quite appropriately so), and we spend very little time discussing whether those personal views actually matter. In this post I hope to develop this point a little more fully.\n \n After reading through these forums and viewing various abortion polling data, it appears to me that a very large majority of people would support some sort of abortion regulation once a pregnancy has reached the third trimester. But in reading polling data surrounding the question of whether the public would support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, the overwhelming majority say they would oppose such a reversal. I hope to show that these two views are contradictory to such a degree that so long as Roe v. Wade remains intact, one's personal view on the issue of abortion has no significance in the area that matters most: the formulation of law.\n \n Since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, abortion policy in the United States has been set by the Supreme Court. In holding that the Constitution protects a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy, the Court effectively took the issue of abortion off of the democratic stage. Because of this decision, the personal views of the American People as to what abortion policy should be implemented at any given stage of pregnancy became insignificant. I submit as an example the case of Stenberg v. Carhart (530 U.S. 914).\n \n Nebraska enacted a law which proscribed partial birth abortion except where the procedure was necessary to save the life of the mother. The law was challenged, and in 2000, the Supreme Court issued a decision overturning that law. Given the present state of affairs regarding the Supreme Court's handling of abortion, it has become apparent that one's personal views about abortion do not-in one very important sense-matter at all. We will, of course, examine whether this ought to be the case in future posts. \n \n Roe stands in the way of any meaningful abortion regulation at any stage of pregnancy (as I intend to show), and those who honestly believe that some sort of protection should be given to the fetus at the third trimester should honestly desire that Roe be done away with. Please note that I have not said that this desire alone would justify or compel one to believe that Roe should be reversed by the United States Supreme Court. I only suggest that those who honestly believe that a fetus in the third trimester of pregnancy deserves some protection (and that is most of us) should pay close attention to this discussion. A discussion of Roe is necessary if we want our opinions on abortion to matter significantly, and that is why I hope to receive input as this thread moves forward.",

   "I do not wish to go into a full debate with you since, frankly, my knowledge of legal jurisprudence is quite limited and it is of low priority for me to spend a lot of time researching it for such a debate. I would leave that to people more knowledgeable and interested in legal theory.\n \n However, it is important for me to point out that Roe vs. Wade does allow for states to limit a woman's right to abortion in the third trimester. Quoting from section X of Roe vs. Wade:\n \nWith respect to the State's important and legitimate interest in potential life, the \"compelling\" point is at viability. This is so because the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb. State regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological justifications. If the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion [410 U.S. 113, 164] during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. \n",

I will get into this in a little more detail, but this has to do with the fact that a \"health\" exception must be included in any regulation in the third trimester.

   "I am willing to conduct a general discussion with you but will not engage in any discussion on legal jurisprudence (ex. literal readings of the constitution vs. judgements of intent of the constitution) for the reasons stated in my previous post.\n\n \n Cool. I will, by nature of this discussion, be broaching these topics at some point, but I didn't want that to discourage you from weighing in whenever you want to. Also, I will be up front about the fact that I will, in the course of this discussion, attempt to persuade you (and others) to dive into the legal issues.\n \n \nPerhaps your concern is that \"health\" is too loosely defined and could therefore be used to block all legislation against third term abortions. I do not know and cannot speak to the legalities of the issue, but I have never heard anyone from the pro-choice side use that as an arguement.\n\n \n That is indeed my concern. I am also aware that the pro-choice side does not argue this. This is why I have begun the discussion. Roe v. Wade is inconsistent with what seems to be the vast majority of pro-choice opinions on these boards specifically, and pro-choice opinions more generally as well.\n \n \nAs for procedures such as partial birth abortion and other attempts by the far-right to limit third term abortion, my understanding (and granted this is from word of mouth only) is that the legislation proposed was too general and purposely included language that opened judicial paths toward banning all abortions. For an example of this type of manipulation of law, if, in the murder of a pregnant woman, a law is introduced in which the killing of her fetus is also considered a murder (making it a double murder), that opens judicial paths to counting the fetus (at any stage) as having the same rights against being killed as any other person. Legislators and judges alike are wary of the slippery slope and do pay attention to such intentional manipulations.\n\n \n Just a couple of points:\n \n First, I believe your characterization that it is the far-right that is seeking to limit third-term abortions is incorrect. There seems to be large support on these forums from both the pro-choice and the pro-life side regarding third trimester abortions. Likewise, the general public seems to have been so upset with the Supreme Courts decision in Stenburg that Congress stepped in and passed a nearly identical statute to the Nebraska law. That statute cleared the Senate with the support of 16 Democrats, and it cleared the House with the support of 63 Democrats.\n \n That is not to ignore the fact that it is largely Republicans that would go further than third trimester restrictions. I am merely trying to point out that Roe stands in the way of restrictions that we all support (third trimester), and thus we all should hope for legal reform in this area.\n \n Secondly, the slippery slope argument is common, and I will address it in more detail later. My basic point is that if we really do think that third trimester fetuses have a significant moral status (and I take people at their word on this), than we should work to reform abortion laws in the United States. And that reform, as I am trying to argue, must begin with the undermining of Roe v. Wade.\n \n Note that I have not yet discussed whether Roe v. Wade should be overturned. I do plan on discussing the legal issues with this case. But as of now, I am only trying to lay some groundwork for why that discussion is so important. A lot of people that I speak with seem to think the law is so technical that it cannot be understood (or is too hard to be understood), and thus they would rather not bother with it. So, I am trying to address that. And I am doing so by simply saying \"If one seriously wishes to restrict abortion in the third trimester (which virtually everyone seems to), than one must seriously consider the legal aspects of the issue.\"",

I, as nearly all others, may have little or no background in legal theory (nor particular interest for that matter) but the justices on the Supreme Court obviously do and there are at least two views held by these experts (which, I should note, none of us are in this thread) about how the Constitution should be interpreted. My knowledge of legal theory may be quite limited but I frankly place far more credence in the views of justices that are far more highly educated in this field than any of us, than I do in either of your opinions.

That is what I was arguing against. Indeed, apparently there are several approaches which judges have used in interpreting the Constitution (which I learned recently from the following Blog that I found from Google searching: http://faculty.ncwc.edu/TOConnor/410/410lect02.htm , which appears to be a few years old but is still relevant). Quoting from that site, and sorry for the legth: \n \nMODES OF CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION\n \n 1. ORIGINAL INTENT, aka Original History, intended meanings of words - the reasoning behind this approach is that the framers carefully debated and chose their words precisely to produce neutral principles of law. Advocates claim it fosters consistency and stability in law, and keeps rights that exist today from ever disappearing tomorrow. Critics claim that it can be easily used to disguise ideological ends, that the framers were not of one mind, and historical records are lost. The doctrine of original intent was used in Hustler v. Falwell (1988) to find that cartoon parodies are a form of protected First Amendment expression. Intent of the framers is also the logic behind reasonable expectation of privacy in Katz v. U.S. (1967). Another place where the doctrine is framed is over whether capital punishment is cruel and unusual, as those words were used by the writers of the Eighth Amendment. The leading proponents of original intent are Justice Stevens and to a lesser extent, Justice Ginsburg. \n \n 2. TEXTUALISM, aka Literalism, Plain Words approach, ordinary meanings of words - this approach doesn't look any further than the words of the Constitution itself; it doesn't try to infer any intended meanings. The reasoning is that justices should take the words as written and promulgated to the people of the United States. A pure textualist, or literalist, approach looks for key phrases like \"Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech\" and finds that no law means no law. Reading the Constitution literally is also called strict construction. Other strands of textualism try to understand what the words would have meant to the people at the time they were written. Advocates claim it produces value-free jurisprudence and keeps justices in touch with the people. Critics claim it leads to inconsistent decision making, and represents a static, non-living document view of the Constitution. Textualism is often found in Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment cases involving criminal procedure when the Court decides to go off in some new expansionist or restrictionist direction. Textual analysis was present in Coy v. Iowa (1988) which struck down a system in which child witnesses could testify behind a screen. The leading proponent of textualism is Justice Scalia and to a lesser extent, Justice Rehnquist.\n \n 3. PRECEDENT, aka Stare Decisis, look at previously decided cases - this is the doctrine of stare decisis (let the decision stand) which means that the Supreme Court looks at its own past decisions. Technically, all courts are bound to follow the rule of law in all previous decisions by higher courts (the Supreme Court being no exception), in what is called the holding. The holding of a case is the opposite of dictum, what is irrelevant to decide a case. For example, if a case involves overturning a confession police obtained from a mentally retarded person, the part about the person being mentally retarded would be the dictum, and the rule that police should not obtain confessions from any mentally challenged person would be the holding. Advocates claim that precedent serves as a clear-cut guide, makes interpretation predictable, and keeps the Court from reversing itself. Critics claim that precedent is used as a weapon rather than guide, justices often pick and choose which precedents they like, and that the Supreme Court has generated so much precedent that support for any conclusion is possible. Precedent is often used as a rationale to limit the rights of criminal defendants. The leading proponents of precedent today are Justice Rehnquist and to a lesser extent, Justice O'Connor. Precedent was present in the reasoning behind the famous desegregation case of Brown v. Board of Education (1954), although that case also involved social scientific testimony that Justices who follow precedent don't always favor. \n \n 4. LOGICAL, aka Mathematical, put words into logic formulas - this is the approach that justices ought to engage in formal reasoning, usually in the form of a syllogism, a type of logic which draws a conclusion from a major and minor premise. Advocates claim that it gives legal reasoning a scientific justification. Critics claim that minor premises are often faulty and lead to invalid conclusions. Currently, there are no Supreme Court justices that use this method. The most famous case to use logical reasoning is Marbury v. Madison (1803) which created the right of judicial review.\n \n 5. PRUDENTIALISM, aka Doctrinal, if appropriate for adversary process - this is a common approach found throughout the court system. What every prosecutor knows is that you only try cases you can win with, look good in court with, and call forth established doctrines or rules of law. The Supreme Court is no exception. It avoids unfamiliar ground, but in some cases will decide on a case very carefully and thoroughly simply in order to allow important legal arguments to be heard, to enhance the prestige of the Court, and to clarify important doctrines. It's unknown how many Supreme Court justices explicitly adhere to this approach, but whenever you get lengthy opinions that cover a wide range of subjects and doctrines, you know its being used. An example is Baker v. Carr (1962) which was a judicial review over legislative redistricting case involving the political question doctrine, the Equal Protection clause, standing, and justiciability. \n \n 6. STRUCTURALISM, aka Aspirational, if maintains social order - this is a Constitution as \"living document\" approach which looks at each and every case as unique, and is more concerned with remedy-making than rule-making. More case specific than philosophical, this method usually results in a balancing test, matching the powers of government on one side and the rights of individuals on the other side. It's unknown how many Supreme court justices use this method, but it's assumed the logic behind the famous abortion case Roe v. Wade (1973) is the idea of a living constitution.\n\n I only post this to note that there is no one RIGHT way to interpret the Constitution. Since the result of Constitutional interpretation depends a lot on which of these approaches a judge chooses to take, the only input that we, as citizens, can have on the process is to vote our conscience in presidential elections and elections for Congress - which ultimately determine the choice and approval of judges.",

   "There is an opinion that appears to be pervasive. That opinion is that a regular person cannot understand the complexities of Constitutional law. It is suggested that Constitutional interpretation is so complex and so intricate that one really needs to be an expert in legal theory if he wishes to understand the Constitution itself, as well as the interpretation of that document. In this post, I will examine this position. I will argue that the Constitution can be understood by ordinary (that is, non-lawyerly) people.\n \n When the delegates of the Constitutional Convention recommended the Constitution to the several states for ratification, some members of the delegation anticipated that the new plan would be heavily opposed. One of those members, Alexander Hamilton, decided to take on a project to defend the charter that was produced at the Convention. His plan was to write a series of papers in favor of adopting the Constitution. After securing the help of John Jay and James Madison, these papers were printed in the popular press, and collectively they would become known as The Federalist.\n \n The Federalist was addressed to \"the People of the State of New York.\" It is safe to assume that in 1787-just as in our day-most of the population was comprised of non-lawyers. Yet Hamilton, Madison, and Jay wrote to these ordinary citizens anyway. Why would they do this if these citizens were incapable of understanding the Constitution? The answer is quite simple I think. Constitutions are written by the people and are adopted by the people. Hamilton knew that understanding the Constitution was a pre-requisite to adopting the Constitution, and thus if a Constitution is to be adopted by the general public, the general public must necessarily understand what it is they are adopting.\n \n We see this borne out in our day as well. Take, for example, the many states that have adopted amendments to their respective Constitutions in recent years (I am thinking specifically of the various marriage amendments). To my knowledge, every one of these Amendments were submitted directly to the people in a vote. Before those amendments were ratified, they had to be approved by the people, and they had to give their consent before it was adopted. It therefore seems strange to assert that the general public would give their consent to a legal text that they did not understand. Would you vote for a Constitutional Amendment that was written in a language that you did not know? So too would we expect the general population to reject an amendment that they did not understand.\n \n I have found that it is more likely than not that the person leveling the charge that the Constitution cannot be understood by the general public has never read the Constitution through in its entirety. I think that this is very problematic, and I will now spend a moment trying to convince those who have never read the entire Constitution to read it.\n \n I would agree that it is impossible-or in the very least, difficult-for a person to understand the Constitution if he has never read it in its entirety. By not having read that document, one is setting himself up to fall prey to those abuses which the Constitution was established to prevent. Suppose you find yourself subject to an interrogation in a criminal investigation. Do you know what can and cannot be done to and by you? Do you know whether you have to provide the information solicited or not? Do you know whether you even have to remain in the interrogation or not?\n \n Now, one may say, \"Oh, if I find myself in that situation, I will just wait for a lawyer.\" But suppose you find yourself in that situation and you find that you are denied a lawyer. What then? This happens several times a year, and the result is that many individuals' lives are impacted forever. And that impact is usually negative.\n \n I humbly suggest that everyone take the time to read the Constitution in its entirety at least once. I just recently did this again, and it took me about 30 minutes. That may seem like too much time to invest, but I have found the benefits of doing so to be vast, and the consequences of not doing so to be potentially devastating. The Articles of the Constitution can be found here, and the Amendments can be found here. I seriously hope you will consider reading them soon.",

   "Perhaps I was misinterpreting what the two of you were saying, but it sounded like you thought that there was only one right way to interpret the Constitution and that was the literal interpretation. That is what I was arguing against. Indeed, apparently there are several approaches which judges have used in interpreting the Constitution (which I learned recently from the following Blog that I found from Google searching: http://faculty.ncwc.edu/TOConnor/410/410lect02.htm , which appears to be a few years old but is still relevant). Quoting from that site, and sorry for the legth: \n \n I only post this to note that there is no one RIGHT way to interpret the Constitution. Since the result of Constitutional interpretation depends a lot on which of these approaches a judge chooses to take, the only input that we, as citizens, can have on the process is to vote our conscience in presidential elections and elections for Congress - which ultimately determine the choice and approval of judges.\n Oh there is a right answer and thus a better way to approach the question. The first three are not really different and really are just minor variations on the other. Precedent, I guess, goes with the 2 but is more of a rule of consistent views as opposed to a way to look at the constitution. Anyway, the people that set up our judicial system had a method in mind...a method that was basically used for the first 100+ yrs before the \"living constitution\" came along. If you argue that the role of a judge should change over time then you argue for the idea that words have no meaning and rules have no authority. There is no question that judges use different approaches but it very clear to me that one approach is the best method to follow what our constitution was set up to do. The federalist papers talk about, the constitution speaks of it, and judges did it for over 100 yrs. I can't think of a more definite approach to things than that.",

   "4. LOGICAL, aka Mathematical, put words into logic formulas - this is the approach that justices ought to engage in formal reasoning, usually in the form of a syllogism, a type of logic which draws a conclusion from a major and minor premise. Advocates claim that it gives legal reasoning a scientific justification. Critics claim that minor premises are often faulty and lead to invalid conclusions. Currently, there are no Supreme Court justices that use this method. The most famous case to use logical reasoning is Marbury v. Madison (1803) which created the right of judicial review.\n I also meant to mention that the bolded statement is false. This wasn't logically come up with but just a plagiarism of the federalist papers. You can't really say you got the answer from logic when the answer was literally told to you....unless you consider it logical to do what it says. This was an example of orginalism more so than \"logical\".",

One might argue that this shows that no one knew the exact same meaning of the constitution. This is not true. They both understand the meaning but the anti-federalists were afraid that the meaning would go away and the constitution would be abused by the government. This kinda led to the 10 amendment which were much different from the constitution as written. The constitution says what the government CAN do why the 10 amendments (bill of rights that is) are things the government cannot do. The anti-federalists argued that if you don't specifically say you can't do it then the government will just assume the power. When talking about the judges they suggested that judges might assume more power as there is nothing there to stop them. My point here is that the anti-federalist papers were not an argument of interpretation but rather an argument of abuse of original meaning and what that might led to. Just this example alone should led one to believe that there is one best method for looking at the constitution.\n \n \nI humbly suggest that everyone take the time to read the Constitution in its entirety at least once.

I would venture a guess that even you believe this. For example, if a federal court interpreted the Constitution in such a way that would allow Vladimir Putin to be President of the United States, I'm sure you would say that the Court was incorrect. If that would in fact be your reaction, you would be suggesting that there are right answers to Constitutional questions, and by consequence, there are also wrong answers to Constitutional questions.\n \n I really hope that people will not shy away from this discussion because they find it to be too complex.

Just look at the last thread where people did not understand that the same process to make slavery ok was the same legal process that made abortion ok...yet we reject the process for one and support it for the other.\n\n \n Abortion is NOT a constitutional right, the \"male\" dominated supreme court in 1973 in essence took the constitution and try to squeeze a square into a smaller circle. \n \n Ending Slavery on the other hand IS in the constition, and is a constitutional right to be \"free\". An amendment specifically written to abolish slavery. (#13)\n \n No place in the constitution, at anytime in American history, did or does the constitution permit the termination of a human life. Just because the U.S. Supreme court in its mind determined they could use a couple of words and \"bend\" them to fit \"their needs, and allowed the gross genocide of 40 millian americans and counting.\n \n To this day, abortion is NOT a constitutional right, only judical law. \n \n Now, if the country wants to make abortion specifically a constitutional right, they can do just that, they just need 2/3 congress and 3/4 of the states to agree and there you go, a new constitutional amendment. Our judges do NOT make constitutional law.\n \n No other debate in history that I'm aware has a side that debates on the \"non-issues\". Pro-choicers say \"its all about choice\", forgetting the real issue WHY women have abortions.\n \n Imagine 1 million women dying every year to self-induced starvation to be like the ultra-thin models, or \"afraid of being fat\" and therefore starve themselves. Are we just going to stand there and say \"its all about choice\" or are we going to address the issues. \n \n No woman of \"right-mind\" would starve herself to death for an image, and no mother, or \"right-mind\" would kill her unborn child. But they do so out of \"fear\", all types of fear, that society has influenced upon them, and instead of addressing the ISSUES, certain people just say \"its a matter of choice what a woman does to her body\"....its a bunch of BS!\n \n Women, I beg of you to help women become stronger women. Don't buy into the propaganda, don't buy into the #### slogans of \"pro-choice\", because who in the H E L L isn't about choice and don't buy into the #### slogan \"pro-life\" because who in the H E L L is for death.

Pro-choice people don't cause women to desire abortion, nor would we ever stand in the way of addressing the issues that make women desire abortion. Truth be told, disallowing abortion sweeps the problem under the rug. You cannot address the problems women have that drive them to consider abortion if the entire abortion issue is off the radar (as it would almost necessarily be if it were illegal).",

I for one think that it would be useful to read the decision in Roe in its entirety for various reasons. First of all, it will help even the novice understand what is perhaps the United States' most notorious and disputed court decision in history (rivaled only by Dred Scott v. Sandford, the slavery case). And secondly, it will help in the direct discussion of this thread. Now, I realize that there are various reasons why one would not be able to read it, and thus I will do my best to give a fair explanation where I think it appropriate.

   "******\n \n This is the fourth installment of a lenthy discussion I began some time ago. You may find the previous installments as follows: Part 1, Part 2, Part 3.\n \n ******\n \n The chances are that if you are reading this thread, you have an opinion about abortion. Some view it as either morally right, or else morally wrong, according to various standards of measurement. The purpose of this post is to establish some ground work for what it is we are actually discussing in this thread. The question we are moving toward is this: was Roe v. Wade correctly decided? There is an interesting observation that can be made simply from that question.\n \n The question implicitly suggests that it is possible for the Supreme Court to have decided Roe v. Wade incorrectly. That being the case, it would behoove us to try and at least narrow what we mean when we say the Supreme Court has decided a case \"incorrectly.\" Supreme Court decisions have consequences. When Roe v. Wade was decided, one of the consequences was that the states were no longer allowed to forbid physicians from performing elective abortions (we will discuss this in more detail at a later time). Immediately after this decision was handed down, multitudes of people either applauded it or condemned it according to, basically, two principles. I wish to discuss these principles and whether they amount to appropriate (or legitimate) principles of evaluating judicial decisions.\n \n The Moral Measurement\n \n Some agree or disagree with the Court's decision in Roe based upon whether they believe abortion to be morally permissible or morally repugnant. Thus, some applaud the decision because they find the result to be moral, while others condemn the decision because they find the result to be immoral. While this might be a perfectly legitimate reason to applaud (or condemn) legislative decisions, I contend that it is a wholly illegitimate reason to applaud (or condemn) judicial decisions. Let us examine this with an example in the negative.\n \n It is easy to conceive of an instance where we would think something to be immoral while at the same time admitting that it is permitted by the Constitution. The example of slavery illustrates the point. Suppose that in 1820, person X believed that slavery was grossly immoral. Nevertheless, it is abundantly clear that slavery was in fact permitted under the US Constitution in 1820. Therefore, it is not the case that every moral blight is forbidden by the Constitution. In short, something may be at once both a gross injustice, yet an injustice that is permitted by the Constitution.\n \n The Legal Measurement\n \n Adherents to the legal measurment, while they may have a personal viewpoint with respect to abortion, nevertheless believe that their personal opinion ought not to play any role in evaluating judicial decisions. For these rascals (of which I am one) it is necessary to have an understanding of the Constitution itself, as well as a theory of how it ought to be interpreted. It is only then that a judicial opinion can be properly evaluated.\n \n An interesting thing to point out in closing this post is that it is not an infrequent thing to find adherents to the legal measurement who believe abortion should be allowed (for whatever reason), but that nevertheless believe that it is not protected by the Constitution. It is also not an infrequent thing to find adherents to the legal measurement who believe that abortion should not be allowed (for whatever reason), but nevertheless believe it to be permitted by the Constitution.\n \n In summary, it is my view that the question of whether Roe v. Wade was correctly decided is neither satisfactorily nor legitimately answered by deciding whether you personally like (or dislike) abortion. To legitimately answer that question, it is necessary to look to the language and history of the Constitution itself.",

   "You must also establish why the \"language and history\" is the only correct rubric to use.\n\n \n Every day we interpret things that are said to us. Take a letter, for example. The two things which are necessary for us to interpret what is said in a letter are the words themselves as well as the context. So long as we have these two things to a sufficient degree, we can understand what the letter says.\n \n A similar thing is necessary, in my view, if one wishes to understand the Constitution. It is important to look at the text of the Constitution as well as our history to find out what the Constitution actually is and what it does. To a large degree, one's answer to these very basic questions control their theory of Constitutional interpretation.\n \n Now, perhaps I am mistaken, but I do not see any other grounds to use when trying to understand what the Constitution is and what it does except text and history. To my knowledge, every interpretive theory begins here. I think where the division comes is in the answer to this question. For example, some may think the Constitution to be largely about federalism, while others believe it to be primarily about liberty. But both of these began by determining what the Constitution is and what it does. And they do so by looking at the text and context (i.e., history).\n \n You'll have to forgive me if I am unclear at times.

Please clarify.\n\n You implied that the words of the parent have no meaning to today. You go on to say that we should still honor those words but change the meaning behind them. This, to me, means that all you are doing is saving a piece of paper with those words on it but you certainly aren't honoring what the parent said. The parent had one meaning and one meaning only so who are you to say it means something different now? Even if this did apply to the law how could one ever understand the law? In theory, you believe that, say, the first amendment could mean that you could limit all speech, limit no speech, limit some speech, limit only words that end in \"y\", etc etc and none of these would be wrong toe them so long as that is what you believed. What a crazy notion where words have no meaning. \n \n \nI'm sorry, this section does not make sense. Please clarify. Looking at the meaning of the passage does not change the passage, let alone create a new one. SCOTUS has not made any legislation, they merely interpret the law (or the Constitution, in this case). This is a legitimate power and in no way merges the Judicial with the Legislature.\n I agree that looking at the meaning of a passage does not change the passage but you already stated that the meaning of a passage is of no significance. SCOTUS does get to interpret the law but you are not saying this. You are saying SCOTUS gets to decide what the law should say....ie the meaning behind the words. SCOTUS may not be changing the ink on the paper but that ink is merely a way to communicate with the meaning being the important aspect. \n \n Simply put, you have words and meaning behind those words which allow us to understand things. Changing the meaning behind those words is just as much changing the law as is changing the actual words.\n \n \nMy only conclusion is that you see it as inconsistent because you do not understand it. What do you continue to misunderstand?\nI do not understand how there is no right and wrong in your worldview yet you still continue to talk to me as if there is one.",

I'm certain the concept must be clear to everyone but your penetrating wit ;) I'm saying that whether a particular interpretation or decisionis \"right\" or \"wrong\" is subjective to the criteria used, Steve.\nInsults aside, if this is what you are saying then you are simply avoiding the questions asked. You obviously believe the constitution should be interpreted in some certain way...commonly called a \"living constitution\" type theory. The question is, is this law subjective to judges. From the sound of your post it seems that you are just trying to fluff up the idea that no one can understand the law.\n \n \n\n And if the speed limit sign said \"Don't drive at excessive speeds\" what would that mean, Steve? The most reasonable approach would be to examine why this prohibition was adopted and attempt to align the limit to that meaning. It would be stupid to limit the speed to what was \"excessive\" 200 years ago\nYou don't get to change the example. The sign doesn't say \"Don't drive at excessive speeds\" although that is clearly what the speed limit is used for. The sign says speed limit 45mph. Now, if that sign is 200yrs old can you say it should mean something different. Your avoidance of the example is not needed.\n \n \nWithout specifics, meaning can be interpreted. You've admitted this as well when you said: SCOTUS does get to interpret the law. They decide what the law means in the circumstances given (meaning: today's society)\nInterpret does not mean develop meaning. Interpret means apply the meaning to the facts of a case just as you say it. The only difference is that you mean something different than you say. You don't agree that you apply the meaning to todays circumstances. What you really are saying is change the meaning to adhere to todays circumstances. The difference being that in one instance the standard stays the same while in your instance the standard changes to fit a desired need of today. In our letter example the letter had one meaning which is to not do drugs. What that letter meant at the time was not very difficult to figure out given the facts I gave (you seem to want to add facts where there are none in the example). However, since circumstances changed in society you seem to think the meaning on the letter could be changed which renders the letter useless. To apply a better example, look at the first amendment. Computers didn't exist when this was written. The first amendment still applies to stuff written on a computer though because the meaning of the amendment is still the same. Now say the first amendment said you have the freedom of speech but only for words spoken out of the mouth. When computers were invented does this amendment now change to go with what people feel is ok? I say no.\n \n In short, you wish to change meaning no matter how you look at it.

We're expanding it's coverage to respond to new situations, instead. Those darn activist Judges ;)\nAgain you misuse and twist words. You have text, meaning, and circumstance (for future application that is). I maintain text and meaning do not change. Thus a first amendment would have a meaning of protected speech. The circumstance that a new speech is developed is rather irrelevant. but look at abortion. Abortion is not a new circumstance. It certainly applied at the time of the constitution. \n \n Your argument is that the meaning changes. So for example the circumstance changes such as a new form of speech so the meaning must change for this. Of course it could change to not include it or do include it depending on what the judge feels that day. I disagree. The meaning of free speech is just that...to allow free speech. \n \n Perhaps you are confusing \"strict constructionist\" with orginalism. In any event, you seem to apply more of a meaning than what really exists and thus you feel like it could change. \n \n \nBut now you're agreeing with me when I'm saying that the meaning of the letter was to prohibit recreational drugs, thus permitting pot for medical uses, whether the parent was against pot or not.\nNo, there was no mention of recreational drugs. In any event marijuana was known at the time. To say that \"well if parent would have known marijuana was ok then he/she woulda supported it\" is a wrong assumption on the meaning of the message. At that time drugs were considered bad to parent of which marijuana was one of those considered bad. The fact that it really isn't is rather irrelevant.\n \n \nCertainly the meaning can change if SCOTUS feels they've misinterpretted that meaning before. They interpret the passages by what they believe the meaning is at the time they make the decision.\nYou really confuse the word \"interpret\". Since when does interpret mean \"to make up a meaning\". Does an interpretor decide what words in one language should mean and translate them into the other language as he/she sees fit or does the interpretor take a definite meaning of the words in one language and explain it in the other language? Furthermore, if the interpretor said something in the second language that was incorrect (misheard the word for example) does this mean the interpretor is correct or was the meaning misunderstood?",

So in our fine example the meaning of the parent's \"don't do drugs\" does matter and this doesn't change even if time as elapsed. \n \n \nInterpreting the slogan \"Don't do drugs\" would likely lead one to \"Don't do recreational drugs for recreational purposes\" to properly convey the meaning in a different language\n \nmaybe but it isn't up to the interpreter to decide that. What if the parent did not mean that? This would be an example of a wrong interpretation would it not? Given the two facts I gave the interpreter can make no more meaning than \"don't do drugs\" with meaning of marijuana as being one of those drugs.

Say you are a customer in a restaurant and ask the waitress for an apple. You have in mind what most of us have in mind when we think of apple. However, the waitress brings you a crabapple. You might say to her \"of course, I didn't mean crabapple when I asked for an apple\" but she would have no way of knowing that except for her interpretation. If you had been from parts of the country where people love crabapples, then her interpretation would have been correct. If you were not specific enough, then it is your own fault if someone interprets incorrectly. You never imagined that anyone would bring you a crabapple instead of a standard apple so you never felt the need to specify further. \n \n Similarly, there are situations that the founders never imagined (how can anyone imagine certain situations that will arise 200 years from now) so they were not specific enough in explaining their intent in various phrases of the Constitution. That is why a judge needs to try to understand their intent from a combination of rational interpretation of the phrase, historical context, the limitations of that contex and how that would be revelant today.\n \nBut how do you go from \"vague and unambiguously\" to \"has no one meaning\". For example the 8th amendment is vague but the death penalty was around when it was made so it would be rather unreasonable to claim this wasn't included as a reasonable form of punishment.

There is some controversy about the suffering caused by lethal injection as well.

If the writers were in disagreement, then the compromise text might have been interpreted slightly differently by each of the writers themselves. If the writers were in good agreement, then there probably was one meaning to the text. Even then, there could well be scenarios that they never imagined and therefore didn't make previsions for in the text.

Either way, I think that you would have to agree that there is a gray region between the writers of the Constitution being:\n 1) Incompetent fools who don't know what they were doing.\n and\n 2) Perfect humans who were in perfect agreement, imagined all scenarios that could occur in the present or future and included provisions for them in their text, and wrote language that was so brilliantly clear that the meaning would be obvious to everyone.\n \n The founders were men of impressive intellect for their time and, in many ways, for all times. They were well read (more so than most any other generation) and had a good understanding of many of the traps and difficulties that nations face in their internal and external politics.

If you think that you do have justification, than support that with quotes from my text.\n \nYou seem to be missing the question. New inventions is not the question...even more so in our case of abortion. \n\n Answering your question more directly. Your question was \"But how do you go from \"vague and unambiguously\" to \"has no one meaning\". For example the 8th amendment is vague but the death penalty was around when it was made so it would be rather unreasonable to claim this wasn't included as a reasonable form of punishment. \". You seemed to be saying that, from historical context, one can pinpoint one exact meaning. That was what I was arguing against in this section of my post. By the way, where abortion is concerned, abortion was legal up to the point of quickening during colonial times and the early years of the US (starting to be more limited around the 1820s). So, historical interpretation of abortion issues would probably work against you here. \n \n Also, once again, just because I claim that there can be various valid interpretations of a vague text does not mean that there were various original meanings. If you DON'T KNOW the exact original meaning or intent because of vagueness of the text or because of a new significant scenario that would never have been imagined in the founder's day, then you have to use all the tools you have to make an interpretation of the original intent - including using logic, historical context, etc.\n \n And you have no proof of this even when we have reason to believe otherwise. Furthermore, you still go from despair of no meaning to allowing changing meanings (if you agree with Sigma) which makes no sense.\n\n You are continuing to miss our points. Neither Sigma nor I claim that there were widely ranging meanings or intents in the text of the Constitution. The original meanings that the founders had in mind were probably either quite specific or had some small variation (if they were a compromise solution). What we are claiming is that often the meaning or original intent is not clear and one has to interpret as best one can. Since we cannot go back in time and read their minds, our imperfect means of making such interpretations would naturally lead to a variety of interpretations.\n \n Also, what specifically are you claiming that I have no proof of?\n \nGreat, that answered nothing. All you have stated is that you think the founders might be in disagreement yet you have no evidence of this but do have evidence to the contrary.\n\n I think almost all historians know of the disagreements between the founders about the issue of slavery. Also, Hamilton even argued against a Bill of Rights being introduced to begin with. Also, founders differed as to the degree of power of the central government vs the power of state governments. These are all well known disagreements. I am surprised that you are not familiar with them. I am sure that I could find many, many more if I took the trouble of looking.\n \nI don't argue that every question can be found in a matter of seconds but I do argue that 1) there is a correct meaning and 2) There is a best method for trying to figure that out.\n \n What Sigma is arguing is that there is no better method to figure out the true meaning and this doesn't matter because the true meaning doesn't matter. Finally, she argues that the meaning changes (ie it is a living document)\n\n I don't think that Sigma is arguing that the original meaning doesn't matter or that living document means that you can have any interpretation as you like. I am still hoping that Sigma will respond to this to clear up misunderstandings.\n \nYou misrepresent the drug letter by the parent. The only point of that is the only information you have would be to conclude that marijuana was something you shouldn't do. \n\n You might also have some record of complaints on the part of the parent as to why they disapprove of drugs. If all of their complaints revolve around the pitfalls of using drugs recreationally, then your interpretation of \"no drugs\" meaning \"no recreational drugs\" might have a high probability of being correct.\n \nI doubt you would argue that because the meaning might be hard to find that you just make up a meaning. Furthermore, how do you suggest that this makes it so the meaning can change? You say half the founders believed slavery to be ok...and the constitution supported this. Did judges go \"well, thats a bad idea so lets get rid of slavery\". No, we have a way to change the constitution.\n\n I admit that I do not know enough about the specific treatment of African Americans by the early Constitution. If the lower status of blacks was specifically spelled out in the Constitution, then the change in their status would have to be made through legislature and ammendment. If, however, their status was not specifically spelled out but it was assumed by people, at the time of the founding, that rights ascribed to men did not apply to blacks, then later times (when blacks were recognized as men just like everyone else) could have allowed a judge to use the new interpretation to claim laws against blacks unconstitutional.\n \nWell can you explain how the method of taking a meaning that you feel best applies to todays society (in other words not even seeking what the original meaning might be) and then that meaning can even change is better or even reasonable? Just imagine if contracts worked that way...\n\n Why do you assume that we do not even seek the original meaning? Justify your assumptions with quotes from our text.",

   "Sometimes the original meaning is clear and obvious. Sometimes it is not. If it is not, then sometimes one can figure out the meaning from historical context. Sometimes, historical context does not help because, as with the medical use marijuana example, it would be hard to know how the founders would have reacted to the new situation. \n This doesn't speak to changing of meanings.\n \n \nYou have no justification for claiming that I hold this view. If you think that you do have justification, than support that with quotes from my text.\nYou started off by defending Sigma. The assumption is that we were going on that. If you don't hold the view that meaning changes then you either have to hold the view that meaning comes from what the writers wrote or that meaning comes from a judges personal viewpoint. \n \n \nYou seemed to be saying that, from historical context, one can pinpoint one exact meaning. \nfrom historical context and original meaning you can figure most every meaning...more meanings than any other approach ever could. To quote Justice Scalia \"my way gives you most of the answers the other way gives you none\".\n \n \nThat was what I was arguing against in this section of my post. By the way, where abortion is concerned, abortion was legal up to the point of quickening during colonial times and the early years of the US (starting to be more limited around the 1820s). So, historical interpretation of abortion issues would probably work against you here. \nThe constitution doesn't speak to every situation. The point was only that abortion was not some new thing.\n \n \nAlso, once again, just because I claim that there can be various valid interpretations of a vague text does not mean that there were various original meanings. If you DON'T KNOW the exact original meaning or intent because of vagueness of the text or because of a new significant scenario that would never have been imagined in the founder's day, then you have to use all the tools you have to make an interpretation of the original intent - including using logic, historical context, etc.\nNot part of the question here.\n \n \nYou are continuing to miss our points. Neither Sigma nor I claim that there were widely ranging meanings or intents in the text of the Constitution. \nI know...Sigma thinks they are irrelevant.\n \n \nThe original meanings that the founders had in mind were probably either quite specific or had some small variation (if they were a compromise solution). What we are claiming is that often the meaning or original intent is not clear and one has to interpret as best one can. Since we cannot go back in time and read their minds, our imperfect means of making such interpretations would naturally lead to a variety of interpretations.\nYou do not need to read minds as you only need to read what they wrote. Some justices even use dictionaries of that time. Seems like a good way to get answers.\n \n \nAlso, what specifically are you claiming that I have no proof of?\nThat the adopters of the constitution thought certain parts of the constitution meant different things (from each other). \n \n\n I think almost all historians know of the disagreements between the founders about the issue of slavery. \nAnd? There was no disagreement on what the constitution said about it. Thus the 13th amendment.\n \n \nAlso, Hamilton even argued against a Bill of Rights being introduced to begin with.\n Yeah, he did. Probably a wise move on his part. Again this shows nothing.\n \n \nAlso, founders differed as to the degree of power of the central government vs the power of state governments. These are all well known disagreements. I am surprised that you are not familiar with them. I am sure that I could find many, many more if I took the trouble of looking.\nYet this doesn't matter. The fact that they had disagreements doesn't mean they wrote a constitution where they disagreed on what they wrote. They compromised and made it law. \n \n \nI don't think that Sigma is arguing that the original meaning doesn't matter or that living document means that you can have any interpretation as you like. I am still hoping that Sigma will respond to this to clear up misunderstandings.\nliving document means that provisions of the constitution change to keep up with the \"evolving standard decency that mark the progress of a maturing society\". So the death penalty might be ok today but not tomorrow. This is not up for dispute.\n \n \n\n You might also have some record of complaints on the part of the parent as to why they disapprove of drugs.\n These comments are the exact reason why you get into your idea of how the constitution works. You infer something and then make conclusions based on that. My example only had two facts. You don't get to infer facts to come up with different judgments. In any event you still went and did a historical analysis to figure out the true meaning...one that doesn't change.\n \n \n \nI admit that I do not know enough about the specific treatment of African Americans by the early Constitution. If the lower status of blacks was specifically spelled out in the Constitution, then the change in their status would have to be made through legislature and ammendment. \nThe 3/5th compromise is something you should know.\n \n \nIf, however, their status was not specifically spelled out but it was assumed by people, at the time of the founding, that rights ascribed to men did not apply to blacks, then later times (when blacks were recognized as men just like everyone else) could have allowed a judge to use the new interpretation to claim laws against blacks unconstitutional.\nNo, and this is evidenced by the 19th amendment that gave the woman the right to vote.

   "This doesn't speak to changing of meanings.\n\n I never claimed that the original meanings change. Many of the meanings and intentions in the Constitution are not completely clear. Therefore, the thingg that changes is our interpretations of those meanings - changing depending on the perspective of the interpreter, and the meaning he/she understands from the text, historical perspective and its applicability to today.\n \nYou started off by defending Sigma. The assumption is that we were going on that. If you don't hold the view that meaning changes then you either have to hold the view that meaning comes from what the writers wrote or that meaning comes from a judges personal viewpoint. \n\n I started off by defending Sigma and also stated some of my own views. When you attacked my views without specifically mentioning Sigma, I thought that we were having a discussion on my views - not Sigmas. To be consistent and clear up miscommunications, let us specifically mention Sigma then if we are referring to her views. Otherwise, the assumption will be that we are referring to our own views. Agreed?\n \nfrom historical context and original meaning you can figure most every meaning...more meanings than any other approach ever could. To quote Justice Scalia \"my way gives you most of the answers the other way gives you none\".\n\n Many answers can be retrieved from historical context. However, historical context often cannot give interpretations for a new situation that the founders never envisioned or made provisions for. Then, one has to try to interpret motivation behind the text. That is more difficult.\n \nYou do not need to read minds as you only need to read what they wrote. Some justices even use dictionaries of that time.

I thought you meant that I had no proof that the founders disagreed on issues relevant to the Constitution. As to whether the founders all agreed on the meaning of the text of the Constitution, I would expect that their agreement would be similar to the type of agreement on context that one sees today in documents that are prepared by committee. Namely, for the most part, the meanings are commonly unuderstood and agreed upon. However, sometimes there is some room for some interpretation - as in the vote to allow Bush to use force if necessary in Iraq, where many Democrats expected that it meant we would explore other options more fully first.\n \nliving document means that provisions of the constitution change to keep up with the \"evolving standard decency that mark the progress of a maturing society\". So the death penalty might be ok today but not tomorrow. This is not up for dispute.\n\n Unfortunately, \"cruel and unusual\" is vaguely defined. The death penalty certainly existed during early America, but does that mean that all founders agreed that capital punishment was not cruel and unusual? I personally don't have the answer to that and don't have the time to research the history. Either way, they should have been more specific if they didn't want the interpretation to be more open.\n \n These comments are the exact reason why you get into your idea of how the constitution works. You infer something and then make conclusions based on that. My example only had two facts. You don't get to infer facts to come up with different judgments. In any event you still went and did a historical analysis to figure out the true meaning...one that doesn't change.\n\n But what if all you had was the prohibition against drugs and no other historical input. One interpretation could be - they were against drugs but the only drug use at the time was recreational, so their criticism must have been only against recreational use. Another interpretation could be - they saw drug use as bad no matter how it is used. Since you have no way of figuring out their intent or what specifically they were against, you have to interpret their intent on insufficient information - which leads to a variety of interpretations.\n \nThe 3/5th compromise is something you should know.\n\n I remember reading that blacks got 3/5ths of a vote compared to whites.

The Ammendments outline the criteria which one CANNOT use to exclude voting rights - by race, or by sex. I wonder, then, whether the Constitution would allow discriminating in voting rights based on, say, hair color ( a silly example but one that is relevant to legality). Anyway, it seems like the issue of rights for various races and for women would have to depend on whether there is a general statement about who gets certain rights. For example, I think it is assumed that women have all the rights covered by the Bill of Rights since it refers to people, not specifically to men. The Bill of Rights does not cover voting rights and I could find no statement outlining who specifically gets voting rights, so that would explain the need for a 19th Ammendment saying that women cannot be excluded from voting.

For example, the term \"liberty\" in the 14th amendment. The great thing about the constitution is that it doesn't matter what the term liberty means as all that is required to get rid of it is Due Process of law. Sigma argues that \"due process\" really means what is now called \"substantive due process\" which is unreasonable.

Citizens was not defined by the courts it was defined by state laws (now apply that to marriage today). Then you had Dred Scott which used the idea that judges can change meaning and they pretty much said blacks can't be citizens.\n \n \nThat makes me wonder whether women had official citizenship in the 19th century - I thought they did. If we assume that the rights outlined in the Constitution apply to all citizens, then that probably means that the Bill of Rights applied to women as well. The 19th Ammendment was needed because voting rights were not defined by the Constitution and were being withheld from women by the states.\nWell it applies when they are considered citizens by other normal laws. It should also be noted the difference in using \"person\" and \"citizen\" in the constitution and their meanings with this.\n \n Like you said, the 19th amendment was needed because nothing in the constitution could have the meaning changed to mean they had a right to vote...not even the 14th amendment.\n \n \nIt just means that the Constitution said nothing about voting rights and left voting rights up to the States - indeed, I read that in a blog yesterday.\nYeah, you are right. Again, it took amendments to force states...not changing meaning in the 14th amendment.

Therefore, there was no general statement of voting rights in the Constitution that one could extrapolate to blacks given modern perceptions.\n No, I was talking about the provisions that referred to just people and not citizens. But to address what you wrote, the claim is one of \"substantive due process\". This is the idea that allows words to have various meanings and then you get into a living doctrine idea which allows for that meaning to change with the times (ie the dealth penalty is ok today but not tomorrow because society doesn't like it anymore). This is what I argue about.\n \n \nThe bottom line is that any reinterpretation based on modern views has to be made on an existing phrases in the Constitution.\nYour conclusion doesn't follow from what you wrote. Meanings don't change...that is why you need amendments like the 19th. You seem to agree with this but if we took your idea of reinterpretation based on modern views then there would never be a need for th 19th amendment and really parts of the 13th and 15th.",

   "Another opinion", 
   "new scenarios is not the question because no one is arguing that new situations don't arise. This wasn't the topic of discussion with Sigma and I don't have an argument with it now. I'm not arguing for a strict construction but rather a reasonable interpretation. There is a big difference. See Thomas and Scalia for what I mean on this.\n\n Well, I don't have the time to research Thomas and Scalia. Given my lack of detailed knowledge of Constitutional jurisprudence, which would require a lot of time I don't have to get up to speed, this was a main reason that I wasn't willing to go into too detailed a discussion on Constitutional interpretation. The only thing I would say here is that I know that you don't doubt that new situations arise. My arguement revolves around how the court should react to those new situation in its interpretation of relevant Constitutional rights.\n \nAnd my point to that is that I obviously had a meaning and even though it was misread my meaning still was the one true meaning. What I meant by that statement doesn't change over time :).\n\n Well, misreading and misinterpretation are two different things. Misreading is a problem in reading comprehension of a clear text - which I was guilty of for that sentence since I read it too quickly - a basic clumbsiness which I assume justices don't make. If, instead, your text had been vague, then there would have been the chance of my misinterpreting it. Fortunately, in the present time, one can check with the writer whether the interpretation was the correct one. For the most part (outside of details in the Federalist Papers, etc.), we don't have that luxury in interpretations of the Constitution - making it uncertain which interpretation is correct and thus often leaving numerous potentially valid interpretations.\n \neven if we assume that you can make up stuff if you don't specifically say it (which I disagree with) then you still have to come up with a way to determine what a term means. For example, the term \"liberty\" in the 14th amendment. The great thing about the constitution is that it doesn't matter what the term liberty means as all that is required to get rid of it is Due Process of law. Sigma argues that \"due process\" really means what is now called \"substantive due process\" which is unreasonable. If you argue that you have to define every word in the constitution then you really have meaningless words and phrases. Due process had a very clear meaning then (and now) so why did we just decide to make it mean something different..ie change the meaning when we knew what it originally meant?\n\n Since I don't have a good knowledge of the Due Process clause, I will use an external quote. From http://www.stanford.edu/group/psylawseminar/Substantive%20Due%20Process.htm :\n \n Supporters of Substantive Due Process, on the other hand, point to its long history and its dynamic ability to defend basic human rights from infringement by the government. They argue that Substantive Due Process provides comprehensive nation-wide protection for all our most cherished rights, which might otherwise be at the mercy of state governments. They argue that the doctrine is a simple recognition that no procedure can be just if it is being used to unjustly deprive a person of his basic human liberties and that the Due Process Clause was intentionally written in broad terms to give the Court flexibility in interpreting it.\n\n \nWell it applies when they are considered citizens by other normal laws. It should also be noted the difference in using \"person\" and \"citizen\" in the constitution and their meanings with this.\n\n What IS the difference in the use of person vs citizen in the US Constitution? Does it mean that the Bill of Rights applies to non-citizens as well? My lack of background in Constitutional jurisprudence is showing here.\n \n No, I was talking about the provisions that referred to just people and not citizens. But to address what you wrote, the claim is one of \"substantive due process\". This is the idea that allows words to have various meanings and then you get into a living doctrine idea which allows for that meaning to change with the times (ie the dealth penalty is ok today but not tomorrow because society doesn't like it anymore). This is what I argue about.\n\n Again, do you understand the Constitution to mean that, wherever it refers to \"people\", then that includes non-citizens? As for the death penalty situation, there would be a few issues I would address:\n 1) Did the writers of the Constitution really agree that capital punshment was not cruel and unusual punishment? Just because it existed during their time didn't necessarily mean that they agreed on it. Perhaps it was left vague and undecided because some agreed and some didn't.\n 2) Has \"substantive due process\" been used to argue against ALL capital punishment or against ones that cause more suffering? After all, it seems that the electric chair and gasing cause more suffering than the old methods of the average decapitation or hanging.\n \nYour conclusion doesn't follow from what you wrote. Meanings don't change...that is why you need amendments like the 19th. You seem to agree with this but if we took your idea of reinterpretation based on modern views then there would never be a need for th 19th amendment and really parts of the 13th and 15th.\n\n If there had been phrases in the Constitution saying that all citizens above the age of 18 get the right to vote, and that all people born in the US are citizens, then there would have been no need for the 19th ammendment (at least where it applied to women born in the US). The need for the 19th ammendment arose because there WAS no outline of which people get voting rights which you could have interpreted to mean women. \n \n As for the issue of the Bill of Rights, as in my earlier question, if \"people\" referred to non-citizens as well, then I think modern interpretations could have claimed that we now consider African Americans as people so they get rights outlined on the Bill of Rights - even without having any new Constitutional ammendments passed. You see my point? There has to be a phrase in the Constitution to begin with that one can re-evaluate based on modern understandings.",
