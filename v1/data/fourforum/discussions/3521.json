   "me too, although I can't vote. But I completely agree with Badnarik's take on education. I am going through public schools and major change is needed. We aren't learning anymore, we're trying to pass tests. The point of school has become to pass tests and not actually learn. People memorize stuff, take the test, then in the next month forget it. We need to focus more on learning. We also should have a more flexible plan. Not everyone learns at the same rate. We need to make it so people have a love of learning and so that people can explore different topics. Everyone should learn the basics but then the teacher could help small groups who didn't understand something or they could help the students who understood it advance to the next level and encourage them to explore things they're interested in. Some things I disagree with him on, but out of him Kerry and Bush, I would vote him if I could vote (I can in 4 more years)",

   "Really, republicans are no longer conservative.\n They try too hard to impose christian values on people.\n That's not the job of the govt.\n \n Why didn't anyone bring up the Constitution Party? That's another ultra-conservative group. I tend to agree with most things that both parties say, especially when it comes to reducing govt. I don't agree with the \"god\" part of the constitutioners. \n \n The Constitution Party wants to abolish the IRS!:) \n from: http://www.constitutionparty.com/party_platform.php\n \nThe Internal Revenue Service is the enforcement arm of the Federal government's present unjust tax system. Citizens, both in groups and as individuals, have repeatedly sought responses from the IRS bureaucracy as to the basis for the agency's tax policies and procedures. No answers have been forthcoming although a responsible government must be answerable to the people and has a duty to those it is supposed to serve.\n \n So do the Libs, though.\n \n They also want to phase out Social Security (who doesn't and good luck!). \n That one is a really tough nut to crack.\n \n Ah, I found something that makes me go \"uh oh\".\n \nWe call on our local, state and federal governments to uphold our cherished First Amendment right to free speech by vigorously enforcing our laws against obscenity to maintain a degree of separation between that which is truly speech and that which only seeks to distort and destroy.\n\n \n So we enforce our right to free speech by abridging it? Hmmm.\n \n Who gets to decide what is true free speech? A church?\n \n Anyway, I'd vote Libertarian if I didn't think that Badnarik wasn't a little goofy. He's not excitingly articulate (from watching C-Span) but I'm sure he means well.\n \n \n \n .",
