HUMAN FREEDOM INDEX\n \n The United Nation's Human Freedom Index compares the amount of freedom that citizens of different countries enjoy. It considers the right to travel, assemble, and speak;\n\n \n A right to travel? Where? For what purpose. Seems a little vague, but okay.\n \n \n the absence of forced labor, torture and other extreme legal punishment (such as the death penalty);\n\n \n I find it interesting that societies that put heinous criminals to death are less \"free\" than those that let them walk.\n \n The death penalty doesn't make one any less free - unless you consider rape and murder essential freedoms.\n \n \n freedom of political opposition, the press and trade unions; an independent judiciary;\n\n \n Once again you're arguing forms of government rather than actual freedom, but okay.\n \n \n gender equality; \n\n \n Good grief. Does this mean that if enough women aren't in the boardroom you have to shut down the company? Sounds fishy to me.\n \n \nand the legal right to trial, counsel of choice, privacy, religion and sexual practice. \n\n \n Ah yes, the usual vague \"privacy\" and \"sexual practice\" freedoms. Whatever floats your boat, I guess.\n \n Looking over the list, I can't help but notice a rather important right that didn't make the cut:\n \n The right to self defense.\n \n You know, the most basic human freedom out there. Why am I not surprised that the UN left this foundational right off the list, but included \"gender equality.\"\n \n emoticon_rolleyes",
