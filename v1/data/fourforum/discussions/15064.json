On march 4, the government shuts down if they do not pass a resolution to continue funding. \n \n Ezra Klein - Wonkbook: One step closer to shutdown?\n \n \nWonkbook: One step closer to shutdown?\n \n Senate Democrats do not seem impressed with the proposal House Republicans have drawn up to delay a government shutdown by two weeks at the cost of $4 billion in immediate cuts. \"This isn't a compromise,\" said Reid spokesperson Jon Summer. \"It's a hardening of their original position. This bill would simply be a two-week version of the reckless measure the House passed last weekend. It would impose the same spending levels in the short term as their initial proposal does in the long term, and it isn't going to fool anyone.\" Er, perhaps things are going better behind the scenes?\n\n \n Both sides say they do not want a shutdown. The democrats have said that they would be OK with a short term extension as long as there are no cuts in it. The GOP has said they would be OK with a short term extension (2 weeks or less) as long as there are relatively heavy cuts in it. Both sides have pretty much said they will not even consider the other sides offer. \n \n There appears to be an impasse and personally I think it is hilarious. I will admit it....I want to see a shutdown. \n \n I think the public is becoming more aware of, and accepting of, the possibility of a shutdown as time approaches, facts become known, and lies are exposed. For example, the Obama administration has repeatedly warned us that a government shutdown will leave grandma starving in the street because she will not get her SS check. It is difficult to pick up a newspaper today, or turn on a news channel, without being told that is completely and totally FALSE, and that even if there is a shutdown, SS checks will keep coming and medicare will continue to operate. Military and federal law enforcement will continue to operate. \n \n I am not sure about other states, but I have seen 4 different news segments in my state where the state wants to ensure people on food assistance that even if the federal government shuts down, their food assistance will continue normally for at least 6 months...ditto low income housing. \n \n The thing most likely to impact your average taxpayer is that national parks and monuments will be \"closed\". Of course, last time we had a shutdown they were \"closed\" and I happened to be camping in a national park at the time. I was there for over a week. It was nice. Peaceful...and nobody was there to kick us out of the \"closed\" park :) A sheriffs deputy did come around to explain to us that there were no rangers on duty, so if there were any problems it would take a while for a sheriffs deputy to respond. When asked if we needed to leave he looked a little confused and said \"It is not possible to trespass on public land....\"\n \n The white house OMB keeps refusing to comment on a shutdown because they keep saying they dont expect one to occur. That tells me that Obamas veto threat is nothing but a bunch of hot air.\n \n I have heard one rumor today that I think is especially interesting and that I got a kick out of. Apparently several top republicans have communicated to their counterparts on the other side of the isle that if there is a shutdown, one of the things they will demand, and will absolutely NOT give up, is a provision that federal workers NOT be paid back pay for time they are out during the shutdown.

   "From further down the page:\n \n \nTim Geithner says the administration wants a five-year deficit reduction deal, reports David Wessel: \"Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Wednesday said the Obama administration was hoping for a bipartisan deal to reduce budget deficits over the next five years or so, but stopped short of predicting an agreement could be reached this year. Staking out a position at odds with Republicans, Mr. Geithner said reducing the deficit to 3% of gross domestic product need not include restraints on benefit programs, known as entitlements...That approach would put the burden of near-term deficit reduction on economic growth, cuts in annually appropriated domestic and security spending and higher tax revenues. Republican leaders have vowed to tackle entitlement spending.\"\n\n I love it. The Obama administration wants a 5 year \"deficit reduction deal\". Yeah, that should help.

I'm pretty sure he's learned a few do's and Don'ts since he dropped the ball the last time he had the Majority.\n\n \n This is not \"last time\". This time, republicans just swept the house with a clear and unmistakable mandate to cut government spending and lower the deficit. \n \n Gallup just did a poll on this:\n \n Neither Party Has Edge on Federal Budget Dealings\n \n It shows that a majority of pretty much all groups favor a compromise. That would tend to indicate that the party that can be painted as failing to compromise can be blamed for the shutdown. In this case, that is unquestionably the democrats. \n \n Frankly I think the democrats have painted themselves into a corner on this one. At this point it seems unlikely that they will come up with anything but a short term measure to keep the government going for a couple of weeks while they hammer out a deal for the rest of the year. The democrats should not have said they would not accept a short term deal with spending cuts attached. Too many people support spending cuts and compromise. Refusing to compromise and allow spending cuts will put them at odds with a large majority of Americans. \n \n \nBottom Line\n \n Congress has barely a week to pass a 2011-2012 federal budget before hitting the March 4 deadline that would trigger a government shutdown. In the high-stakes political maneuvering taking place before then, public opinion largely supports Republicans' insistence on a plan that makes significant cuts in government spending, and this could put pressure on Democrats to meet them more than half way. At the same time, it may strengthen Democrats' power to bargain for fewer cuts as part of a compromise plan to avoid a government shutdown.\n\n \n Frankly I dont think that your insistence that the republicans would be blamed for a shutdown and that the people would punish them in the polls makes any sense at all. The people are demanding cuts. The democrats are refusing to make them. If we end up with a shutdown because of that, it is the democrats who are at fault for refusing to bend to the will of the people. I am having trouble imagining how they could spin that to turn the republicans into losers. \n \n I also think you need to go back and look at the last (Clinton Era) shutdown. You are using that as a model to determine which party is likely to benefit from a shutdown. The situation now is FAR different. Last time around, a majority of Americans did not even support the cuts being suggested. The reason behind the shutdown likewise enraged people:\n \n United States federal government shutdown of 1995 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \n \"He told a room full of reporters that he forced the shutdown because Clinton had rudely made him and Bob Dole sit at the back of Air Force One... Newt had been careless to say such a thing, and now the whole moral tone of the shutdown had been lost. What had been a noble battle for fiscal sanity began to look like the tirade of a spoiled child. The revolution, I can tell you, was never the same.\"\n \n Gingrich's complaint gave rise to the perception of his behaving in a petty egotistical manner, and Clinton defended the seating arrangement as a courtesy to Gingrich, the back of the plane being closer to his pickup car.[1] Later, the polls suggested that the event badly damaged Gingrich politically.[4]\n\n \n THAT is why the democrats benefited from the shutdown. Even at the time it was seen as nothing but a petty power play by republican leadership.\n \n Contrast that with today, where you can not even FIND an economist who supports our fiscal policy, and over 95% of them polled call it \"disastrous\" . Contrast that to today where a large majority of Americans see cutting federal spending as a top priority. Contrast that with today where the joint chiefs of staff are on record as saying that the biggest threat to this nations security is NOT terrorists, or invasion, it is our federal deficit. \n \n That is WORLDS away from 1995, where the government was shut down because Newt was a dick and everybody knew it. Nobody is going to be able to point at the republicans this time around and claim it is their fault, and if we end up with a shutdown Obama will have lost every single bit of his fiscal conservative credentials, which he BADLY needs if he is to be re elected.\n \n It is also worth noting that this time around there is a MUCH better plan in place for a shutdown. For example, last time, as you note above, new SS applications were not processed in a timely manner because they laid off everybody but those directly responsible for issuing checks. This time around, new applications will be approved in a timely manner because the entire SSA is seen as mandated and self funded.\n \n I am just not seeing your logic here. If we see a shutdown it will be because the democrats and the white house are not willing to pass a budget with cuts in it....which the VAST majority of americans support. How are they going to come away from this looking like anything but unreasonable obstructionists?",

How are they going to come away from this looking like anything but unreasonable obstructionists?\n\n \n Those polls that show 71% of Americans favor spending cuts are not polling on all the facts. If you ask people one question and they answer yes then sure, your poll will come out as 71% in favor. \n Other polls that go deeper show that Most Americans favor spending cuts in Foreign Aid, yet the numbers drop drastically on cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Education. \n \n My Logic is simple.. I'm just looking at a few things to come up with my position.\n \n 1. Obama's Approval rating is up to 50% according to the latest polls. We are starting to show signs of economic growth,although small , still a turn around from the earlier polls.\n 2. The Government is Currently the Largest Civilian Employer in the U.S. Currently there are just over 2 million Civilian Employees, who will NOT be getting paid, in the event of a Shut down. \n 3. It is clearly the GOP who is not willing to negotiate. Boehner made that clear when he gave the Democrats an ultimatum. Playing games with peoples lives will not set well , especially for those 2 million newly unemployed civilian workers, who will ultimately blame the GOP just as they did in 96. The GOP is more interested in harming Obamas' 2012 chances, I believe they are putting their money on a shut down being blamed on Obama. I believe they are intentionally tying to force a shutdown to hurt Obama in 2012. But I also believe the American people know this as well and the GOP plan will backfire again. \n \n I could be wrong, it might backfire on the Democrats and cost them everything in 2012, but I think worrying about 2 years from now isn't the point. They need to Come to a Compromise to avoid a shut down if they expect to move forward with fixing the problems we face now.",

We are spending $4.4 TRILLION (yes, the budget says 3.5 but in reality it is 4.4) and you think slashing the veins comes at $60 billion? You understand a 5 day shutdown (assuming everything shuts down...which it doesn't) achieves the same spending cuts?\n \n I don't know how else to spell it out for you. $60 billion is a joke of a cut. $100 billion is a joke of a cut. Frankly, $500 billion is a joke of a cut. \n \n \n1. Obama's Approval rating is up to 50% according to the latest polls. We are starting to show signs of economic growth,although small , still a turn around from the earlier polls.\nNot my polls: Obama Approval Index History - Rasmussen Reports\n \n And I haven't seen much in terms of economic growth. The only good news this year was a good manufacturing report but I didn't get a chance to read it so it might just be inventory restock.\n \n \n2. The Government is Currently the Largest Civilian Employer in the U.S. Currently there are just over 2 million Civilian Employees, who will NOT be getting paid, in the event of a Shut down. \nI know lots of them, they'll be fine. Traffic in DC might improve for once.\n \n \n3. It is clearly the GOP who is not willing to negotiate. Boehner made that clear when he gave the Democrats an ultimatum. Playing games with peoples lives will not set well , especially for those 2 million newly unemployed civilian workers, who will ultimately blame the GOP just as they did in 96. The GOP is more interested in harming Obamas' 2012 chances, I believe they are putting their money on a shut down being blamed on Obama. I believe they are intentionally tying to force a shutdown to hurt Obama in 2012. But I also believe the American people know this as well and the GOP plan will backfire again. \nGood for the GOP. They shouldn't negotiate a softball spending cut of under 2% of the budget. Frankly the anti-cut folks should look at that as a win.",

   "Wait, what exactly have the democrats proposed in spending cuts? Something like less than .5% of the budget? The republicans plan is only like 2% or less of the budget. Sorry but an \"across the board\" (which it isn't) cut of 2% is not hurting anyone. The fact that the democrats OPPOSE that is more pathetic than the republicans suggesting only to do that. In fact, out of everything they are cutting there is not one thing I see that will directly effect 99% of Americans. If the democrats can't do these \"drastic\" cuts now than there is 0 hope for the future. \n\n \n You are correct that the Democrats mere.5% cuts are pathetic, as is the GOP bill that they are pushing so hard. My point is that both parties are willing to shut the Government down for spending cuts that are just as pathetic. The GOP is adamant about their Bill.. the Democrats are not.. I can see why ..\n \n Here's a rough list of some of the proposed cuts from the GOP bill...\n \n - \"repeal\" of remaining stimulus funds (now $45 billion),\n A joke, this saves nothing .\n \n  privatizing Fannie and Freddie ($30 billion), \n More nothing\n \n - Cutting the federal workforce by 15 percent through attrition, and do this by allowing only one new federal worker for every two who quit.\n Yep, Talk about creating Jobs but Kill hundreds of thousands of Jobs instead. This affects many citizens who will feel the pain if this passes.\n \n - Killing the \"fund for Obamacare administrative costs\" for $900 million\n \n Not worried about this one, they can't do this anyway. ObamaCare is Law, therefore it falls under Non-discretionary spending and under Law they have to fund this. If they want to change the Law they can but we all know they will not get that done so they have no choice but to fund Obamacare.\n \n - Ending Amtrak subsidies for $1.565 billion\n - Ending intercity and high speed rail grants for $2.5 billion\n Yeah just when we need to INVEST in high speed rail they want to cut , affecting even more jobs .\n \n - Repealing Davis-Bacon for $1 billion\n Not sure what this would accomplish if anything Davis -Bacon has been intact since 1931 and they just now decide it's a bad thing.\n \n - Cutting annual general assistance to the District of Columbia by $210 million, and cutting the subsidy for DC's transit authority by $150 million.\n Reforms that go after their own perks:\n - Cutting the Federal Travel Budget in half, for $7.5 billion\n - Cutting the Federal Vehicle Budget by 1/5, for $600 million\n - Halve funding for congressional printing - $47 million annual savings\n - Ending the death gratuity for members of Congress\n \n These I can agree on, they are really taking one for the team here, although it's a bit lame.\n \n My point is The GOP/and Democrats are not really serious about making Cuts to Spending. They don't seem to care one way or another, all they're doing is Grandstanding and throwing mud on each other to remain in control or to try to regain control of the house/Senate/White House. The Tea Baggers don't seem to be much better. Rand Paul is the only one who seems serious, however he is way out there with extreme. Going over his Proposal again I had to Agree with Some or most of his proposed cuts, but there are some, like cutting 83% from Education that I wonder about. His proposal looks good on paper but in the real world it's far too extreme for the GOP or the Democrats to accept so it will probably go nowhere. \n Obama 's Budget is a Joke, but IMO at the point we are right now I think it would be the best Option for the GOP to accept . Now don't get me wrong, I don't like Obamas' budget anymore than the others, but if the GOP is seriously wanting to get Obama out of Office then they should pass his Budget and let that decide his fate. Our Economy couldn't suffer any more than it is/has so if Obama is correct in his assumptions and the GOP will work with him his plan just might work. I'm beginning to think that is the key reason the GOP refuses to consider his Budget, because they fear he just might be right and that would suck for them in 2012.",

   "Obama 's Budget is a Joke, but IMO at the point we are right now I think it would be the best Option for the GOP to accept.\n\n Why? At this point, we should accept a .5% cut over a 2% cut? Not even close. We need a hell of a lot more than a 2% cut. Even a 2% cut is XXXXXXX in the ocean, but it is still better than a .5% cut. You do understand how dire our financial situation is...don't you? \n \n While the republicans seem to be a little more serious about cuts than the democrats, neither side has come anywhere close to reality in what we need to do. Partisan politics continue to remain the SOP's of the day. Meanwhile, we slip closer and closer to disaster. It seems pretty clear that neither the republicans or the democrats have any desire to fix our problems. \n \n \nNow don't get me wrong, I don't like Obamas' budget anymore than the others, but if the GOP is seriously wanting to get Obama out of Office then they should pass his Budget and let that decide his fate.

Our economy can suffer more...and probably will. The vast majority of our politicians are more concerned with saving face and being able to blame the other side when things really go bad than they are with actually fixing the problem and avoiding the coming disaster. You say that they should \"pass his budget and let that decide his fate\". Where you go wrong is that you fail to realize that it is our fate as a nation that is at stake.

   "Key word is Compromise. When John Boehner came out today and drew a hard line in the sand he told everyone in America that it is in fact the GOP who are refusing to Compromise. The GOP/Teabag machine are holding the American People Hostage with their refusal to negotiate . They have told the Democrats either they pass their spending cuts through the Senate or face a Shut down, to me that doesn't sound like Someone who is willing to Compromise. The American People see this too and in the end the GOP will take the blame if this shut down happens.\n\n \n Sorry but NO, not a chance. \n \n So far the republicans have backed down from $100 billion in cuts this year to $60 billion in cuts this year. They then offered a short term extension to negotiate, but required a $4 billion cut be attached. They have even backed off on that $4 billion by saying that it could come from canceling earmarks that are already in the pipeline.\n \n And the democrats have done....NOTHING. Despite overwhelming support by the American people for cuts, they have not offered a single one. Every single cut the republicans have offered up, the dems have said was unacceptable. \n \n Frankly the republicans, and the tea baggers, have already compromised so much that they are running out of things to give up. If they \"compromise\" any more they will be INCREASING the budget. \n \n \n \n Both sides realize that spending cuts are essential to any success in saving this economy. The Problem I have with the GOP at the moment is that they are acting far too extreme simply cutting anything and everything while at the same time refusing to address increasing taxes to balance the Spending cuts. There are some areas where it will be necessary to spend, but according to the GOP we can just turn off the faucet to everything and that is all that is needed.\n\n \n Sorry, but this is a load of stinky brown stuff. Cutting anything and everything??? So far the most extreme cuts they have actually put forth total less than 2% of the federal budget. Trying to paint them as crazed fiscal conservatives lopping chunks of spending out of federal programs with abandon and with no thought to the consequences make you look a little silly. \n \n If this is \"far too extreme\" to you, then you are going to be VERY disappointed in the future. We need a minimum of FIFTY PERCENT in cuts to get our fiscal house in order, and that is WITH large tax increases (possibly large enough that it will damage the economy). We dont really have a choice in this. We will either make the cuts on our own...on our own terms...or we will make them because our bond purchasers force us to. \n The only thing that is really certain here is that it WILL happen. \n \n \n \nNo the Democrats are refusing to be blackmailed into extreme measures. The Democrats realize that cuts are needed, they aren't simply trying to appease their voters by slashing their veins all at once. The GOP proposal that cuts spending by 60 billion is far short of the promise made by the GOP and Tea Party last year but they are dead set on getting that bill passed and they have said they are willing to prove it by allowing the government to be shut down. It has never worked for them in the past, and sadly it won't work this time either. \n \n\n \n BS. You are literally the only person I have seen that has called the pathtic $60 billion in cuts that the republicans want as \"extreme measures\". They are anything but. They are frankly too pathetic to even be considered a down payment on fiscal responsibility. \n \n And you think that there is some possibility that the american people, who overwhelmingly support deficit reduction, are going to side with the democrats in the belief that a 2% cut is too draconian to even consider? Good luck with that. \n \n \nThose polls that show 71% of Americans favor spending cuts are not polling on all the facts. If you ask people one question and they answer yes then sure, your poll will come out as 71% in favor. \n Other polls that go deeper show that Most Americans favor spending cuts in Foreign Aid, yet the numbers drop drastically on cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Education. \n\n \n The problem with even this is that nobody is talking about blanket cuts to SS, medicare, or education. Ask me if I support general cuts in SS and I will say NO. Ask me if I favor cutting SS payments to retired millionaires and the answer changes. The drill down that you seem to see as supporting your position makes the poll LESS specific, not more specific. \n \n \n \n1. Obama's Approval rating is up to 50% according to the latest polls. We are starting to show signs of economic growth,although small , still a turn around from the earlier polls.\n 2. The Government is Currently the Largest Civilian Employer in the U.S. Currently there are just over 2 million Civilian Employees, who will NOT be getting paid, in the event of a Shut down. \n 3. It is clearly the GOP who is not willing to negotiate. Boehner made that clear when he gave the Democrats an ultimatum. Playing games with peoples lives will not set well , especially for those 2 million newly unemployed civilian workers, who will ultimately blame the GOP just as they did in 96.

I believe they are intentionally tying to force a shutdown to hurt Obama in 2012. But I also believe the American people know this as well and the GOP plan will backfire again. \n\n \n Only if the American people are completely brain dead because you whole thing here does not make sense. The GOP has ALREADY compromised. The Democrats and the white house have REFUSED to compromise even a little bit. YES Boehner gave the democrats an ultimatum.....He told them \"we will not allow you to hold the will of the American people in contempt\". \n \n There is simply no possible way that the democrats allowing the government to be shut down over LESS THAN 2% IN CUTS comes out looking bad for the republicans when the vast majority of Americans favor cuts. \n \n IF the democrats came up with their own cuts, they could do some horse trading. The GOP has already said they welcome the chance. But the dems are not offering ANY cuts and are saying they will not pass any cuts for the rest of this fiscal year. This is not the GOP being obstinate, it is the democrats refusing to negotiate.",

If they \"compromise\" any more they will be INCREASING the budget. \n\n \n I respectfully disagree. They are simply sticking to their original proposals by offering to extend the budget debates for a couple of weeks, but they are not Compromising. They initially offered a plan to cut 100billion, the amount they promised back in November. Then they backed off on that down to 60 billion. They passed that version in the house and it now sits waiting to be heard by the Senate, which they realize is not going to happen because Reid will not even consider it. Now they offer a slimmed down version of the same Cuts, and they have said unless they get what they want there will be a shut down. \n \n That's not a Compromise. Reid and the Democrats want to keep spending at Current levels until they can agree on a Budget for 2012, and I agree this is the right move. Sure Cuts will have to be made, but Immediate Cuts are going to do nothing but cause Americans to suffer the consequences. Many of those cuts that the GOP is fighting so hard for are programs that they have ALWAYS disliked. Their cuts do not Solve our problems, they create more. They are once again attempting to take this Nation backwards, and I applaud the Democrats for standing up to them . \n \n I know our current situation is not the same as in 96 when the Government shut down for 3 weeks, but there are some similarities. Just like Gengrich did back then Boehner is pushing forward with his plan with his eyes closed. He's refusing to Compromise or negotiate, simply his way or the highway is his attitude. Americans may \" Overwhelmingly\" support deficit reductions according to some polls, But Like I've said before, those polls didn't poll every American in the country. I don't put a lot of faith in Polls, no matter who runs them. Pollsters poll a specific demographic area of known likely voters and come up with numbers that reflect the entire nation.. I don't buy it. In reality I don't think MOST of America has a clue what goes on in Government, who is cutting what, or why they cut or spend. But when Those same people are affected by something the Government does, then they come out in droves. A government Shut down Now will spell bye bye for the GOP in 2012, not to mention put us in danger of economic collapse. I will Admit I am leaning more towards the Left on this issue,but so far in the last 20 years or so the Right hasn't given me much reason to trust them to know what they are doing.",

The GOP is actually bending backwards to give us the shaft with spending cuts and all you can say is they aren't compromising enough? Not doing Rand Paul's idea is a compromise.\n \n Like Daewoo keeps telling you, we either make the cuts now on our own terms or let our creditors do it for us later.

That's like me saying I'm not going to buy a new car I can't afford this year so I'm saving myself $40k. Yeah, you aren't spending that but you are still pushing a 2 trillion deficit that you did last year. \n \n Look, no matter what the economy is gonna tank when you do the spending cuts. We can pretend it will be better when times are better but I seriously doubt it and I seriously doubt we have that kind of time. Foreign nations have already suggested dropping the dollar like a bad habit. Should we wait to see if they are serious?\n \n \n I can assure you I'm not on drugs nor am I mentally unstable..Investing will go further towards recovery than slashing programs that affect people will. \nNo it won't. There is no free money. 1.5% cuts won't affect many people if any. States cut over 15% in the last two years alone; are those states completely gone? You are basically suggesting we keep things at current levels and \"invest\" in new things which is the same thing as spending more. Someone has to buy those bonds and at some point we have to pay them back. The ponzi scheme fails at some point.\n \n \nThe Democrats want to freeze spending rather than enact additional Cuts right now. \nYeah, jack up the spending to record levels and then freeze it...big move.\n \n \nIMO this is the smart move.

You seem to think we can't cut because of the economy but if we cut defense, ss, and medicare that's fine. Those 3 would hurt the economy MORE than these current spending cuts. \n \n Honestly, it is a little confusing that you think 1.5% in cuts is going to destroy the economy. It won't destroy anything, including the deficit. If you made $50k a year and they cut your salary by 1.5% you'd loss $750 bucks. Are you honestly telling me if someone got their salary cut by $750 that they are heading towards the courthouse to file for bankruptcy? \n \n The democrats are reckless here; plan and simple.

They seem to not care where or what they cut as long as they can reach some magic number. Cutting 1.5 % or 2.0% or whatever it is will not have an effect and will not slow down the rising debt. I've seen them do this time and time again, preach cut spending only to turn around and increase spending elsewhere. Sure, cut the Food Stamps out for the poor, but let's increase defense spending. Oh and by the way, let's give huge tax breaks to everyone so we can drive this car into the ditch just a little faster. The GOP likes to think they know how to balance a Budget but in the real world all they like to do is line the pockets of their Corporate buddies. \n \n I agree with you that Massive cuts are needed.

They passed that version in the house and it now sits waiting to be heard by the Senate, which they realize is not going to happen because Reid will not even consider it. Now they offer a slimmed down version of the same Cuts, and they have said unless they get what they want there will be a shut down. \n \n That's not a Compromise. Reid and the Democrats want to keep spending at Current levels until they can agree on a Budget for 2012, and I agree this is the right move. Sure Cuts will have to be made, but Immediate Cuts are going to do nothing but cause Americans to suffer the consequences. Many of those cuts that the GOP is fighting so hard for are programs that they have ALWAYS disliked. Their cuts do not Solve our problems, they create more. They are once again attempting to take this Nation backwards, and I applaud the Democrats for standing up to them . \n\n \n This is complete and utter bullsh\"*t. First, the democrats spending \"freeze\" is not a spending freeze. They essentially use accounting tricks to make a $1 trillion increase look like a \"freeze\". Second of all, it makes COMPLETELY unrealistic growth forecasts...growth forecasts that the CHINESE could not meet, to provide the reductions. \n \n As far as compromise...the republicans started at $100 billion, backed down to $40 billion, and are now willing to pass a short term extension to give them time for the longer term one in exchange for $4 billion in cuts, and now they are even willing to let the democrats pick the 4 billion in cuts.\n \n The democrats, on the other hand, have not offered ANYTHING. NOTHING AT ALL.\n \n We do not have an option when it comes to immediate cuts. They have made austerity cuts all over Europe and the Chinese have said that if we dont do the same RIGHT NOW they will replace US bond buying with European bond buying. That means a TRILLION dollar cut RIGHT NOW because we simply will not have the money. \n \n The republicans have bent over backward to accomodate the brain dead on the other side of the isle who are literally playing chicken with the END OF AMERICA. We live in a country where the chairman of our central bank LITERALLY got up in front of congress and told them that the very first thing he does EVERY MORNING before he even leaves his bedroom is check to see if the US treasury has failed overnight. We are on the brink of being a failed nation and all the democrats can think about is buying some votes so they can hopefully get re-elected in 2012. \n \n \nI know our current situation is not the same as in 96 when the Government shut down for 3 weeks, but there are some similarities. Just like Gengrich did back then Boehner is pushing forward with his plan with his eyes closed. He's refusing to Compromise or negotiate, simply his way or the highway is his attitude. Americans may \" Overwhelmingly\" support deficit reductions according to some polls, But Like I've said before, those polls didn't poll every American in the country. I don't put a lot of faith in Polls, no matter who runs them. Pollsters poll a specific demographic area of known likely voters and come up with numbers that reflect the entire nation.. I don't buy it. In reality I don't think MOST of America has a clue what goes on in Government, who is cutting what, or why they cut or spend. But when Those same people are affected by something the Government does, then they come out in droves. A government Shut down Now will spell bye bye for the GOP in 2012, not to mention put us in danger of economic collapse. I will Admit I am leaning more towards the Left on this issue,but so far in the last 20 years or so the Right hasn't given me much reason to trust them to know what they are doing.\n\n \n This is just nonsense. The GOP can point to an entire list of things they have done in an attempt to compromise. The democrats can not show one, single thing. \n \n The democrats are simply WRONG on this entire issue. There is absolutely no question and anybody with a 4th grade math education can see it. They are calling this pathetic 1.5% cut \"irresponsible\" and \"draconian\" when, in fact, it is a pathetic little nothing. We MUST cut $500 billion in the next couple of years or we become a failed nation.\n \n It really speaks poorly of their supporters intelligence. If they can actually sell 1.5% in cuts as \"draconian\" to their supporters, there is really little hope left for the nation...I am going to start investing HEAVILY in ammo and security...because there is simply no way America can be saved.",

   "I'm not saying 1.5% cuts would destroy the economy.. I'm saying it's pointless to allow the government to shut down by pretending that 1.5% is going to help. The GOP is fooling people into believing that they are the only ones with a solution, when neither side has a clue apparently. Cutting spending is needed, but not the kind of cutting they are asking for. You don't kill jobs when unemployment is running over 10%.\n \n I disagree. I believe it's the GOP that is being reckless. They seem to not care where or what they cut as long as they can reach some magic number. Cutting 1.5 % or 2.0% or whatever it is will not have an effect and will not slow down the rising debt. I've seen them do this time and time again, preach cut spending only to turn around and increase spending elsewhere. Sure, cut the Food Stamps out for the poor, but let's increase defense spending. Oh and by the way, let's give huge tax breaks to everyone so we can drive this car into the ditch just a little faster. The GOP likes to think they know how to balance a Budget but in the real world all they like to do is line the pockets of their Corporate buddies. \n \n I agree with you that Massive cuts are needed. But until one side or the other comes up with something real I won't take either side serious, and them playing this cat and mouse game over a bucket of peanuts is ridiculous. \n Rand Paul so far is getting there, he just goes a little extreme in some areas.\n\n \n How in the world are we going to get the $500 billion in cuts we NEED when the democrats are willing to see the government shut down rather than pass $61 billion in cuts?? You have to start somewhere. I agree that $61 billion is pathetic. In fact, I sent a strongly worded message to my representatives letting them know that I was seriously disappointed in the fact that they backed off from $100 billion, and that if they backed down from their $61 billion fallback position that not only would I not support them in the next election, I would do absolutely everything in my power to see them replaced. I also told them that if they did not get SIGNIFICANT concessions in return for raising the debt ceiling, I would make it my personal mission in life to ensure that they never hold public office again.\n \n They may listen, they may not, but frankly I am a good enough fund raiser that they ignore me at their own peril. Congressional seats are bought, everybody knows it, and I am about 90% sure I can raise enough money next time around to make sure they do not get to keep theirs. \n \n What we have here is literally one side calling for cuts and the other side refusing. The democrats are not calling for different cuts. They are simply refusing to cut. Obamas budget is an increase pretending to be a cut. \n \n What this boils down to is \"do you like america\". If the answer to that question is \"yes\", then you need to nod your head like a bobble head doll every time somebody says \"cut spending\" or \"increase taxes\" because that is the ONLY way America will still be recognizable in 10 years. We are literally at that point. Waiting until 2012 to do something about it is not an option. We start moving NOW as a show of good faith to our investors, or it does not matter WHAT we pass for 2012, we will simply not have the money to pay for it.",
