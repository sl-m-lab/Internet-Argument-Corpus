   "Unless you live in Great Britain or Africa, Mad Cow shouldn't be much of a problem. It is caused by, I believe, a prion (a protein string simpler than even a virus) that infects the brain and causes holes to form. It can only be contracted by eating the brain or spinal cord of a diseased organism. The reason I said Africa is because of cannabalistic practices which cause epidemics of this disease to decimate villages.\n \n AIDS is mostly a homosexual epidemic. Go to the Center for Disease Control's website and look at the numbers. If people could control their sex lives, then these diseases would eventually die out.\n \n Alzheimer is just sad, but it is also one of the possible effects of aging. Remember that life expectancies have increased dramatically in the last 100 years, as have cases of Alzheimer. I feel that it is not necessary to devote enormous funds to finding a cure because many scientists have said that the best cure is keeping the brain active through books, crosswords, and other critical thinking activities.\n \n I voted for cancer because it strikes everyone. The young, the old, the weak, the strong, nobody is really safe from it.\n \n I agree that diabetes is treatable. Most of it comes from being overweight and not eating healthy. Why devote money to a cure when the best cure is simply watching your diet?",

And why should we not kill these animals? You make it sound as if they are killing all the infected animals and not looking for a cure for it. Killing the infected animals and burning them assures that they will not be later used for food (either for human consumption or feed for other animals). It in no way \"allows the disease evolution and time to jump species\". That statement makes no sense. Trust me, they are looking for a cure as we speak...all over the world. \n \n \nYet no cure \n (in response to someone saying diabetes is treatable).\n \n There is no cure for diabetes, likely never will be. If you understood that diabetes is caused by the inability of the beta cells of the pancrease to produce sufficient insulin supply for the body, you might get it. And cure is a relative term. People can live relatively normal lives with diabetes, so could we say that injecting insulin or implanting an insulin pump is a cure? Not every disease is caused by bacteria or viruses. \n \n \nAs far as I know, it hasn't been around for long / not diagnosed/spoken of except in the last 5-10 yr's perhaps\n \n \n Really?\n \n \nThe\" reason\" for sudden Autoimmune disorders have my attention as well, likewise, epilepsy\n \n \n What is a sudden autoimmune disorder?

Also prions arise naturally in the body as well so crossing species is not an issue, they are just misfolded proteins.\n \n Diabetes isn't really a killer if properly controlled, in late onset diabetes (type 2?) the factors that led to it are (obesity, smoking-< asclerosis etc).",

If people could control their sex lives, then these diseases would eventually die out.\n \n \n Perhaps in the United States and Europe it is more prevalent among homosexuals. Look at Africa. In Africa it is not primarily homosexual. It really is a societal debate. And by \"control their sex lives\" do you mean \"not be gay\"? I certainly do no think that is the answer, at best I think proper education and protection is our best defense against HIV. I doubt that HIV will ever be completely eradicated. \n \n \nI agree that diabetes is treatable. Most of it comes from being overweight and not eating healthy. Why devote money to a cure when the best cure is simply watching your diet?\n \n \n This is true for non-insulin dependent diabeted (NIDDM) aka. type II Diabetes. Diet, exercise, and sensable living can mitigate the symptoms, and make reliance on medication unlikely, however I would not call this a cure. There is still an underlying disease process, and it is important to not forget that. \n Type I Diabetes (IDDM) is usually inborn or developes early in life. Those with IDDM cannot control their diabetes through diet and exercise. These people have a malfunctioning pancrease, which is not producing insulin. Therefore, it is neccesary for them to recieve insulin in order to maintain function. Again, \"cure\" is a rather subjective word to use with Diabetes.",
