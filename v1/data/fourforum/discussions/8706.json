Funny how they ask you to sign a petition, yet do not tell you what they plan to do to curb the gun violence. \n My guess is that they want to make an end run around the 2nd amendment, and simply take away 2nd amendment rights of law abiding citizens. I can't see how this will have any effect in actually reducing crime in the city.

   "So the fact that there are fewer crimes in britain is evidence, but the fact that there is a great deal more crime in S Africa, despite having some of the strictest gun control laws in the world, is not?\n\n Well, I think the UK has much stricter gun laws than South Africa.

I know that the report cited by the brookings XXXXXX admits to ONLY reporting federal and state laws, but not local (I know that there are 34 local gun control laws where I live, including the all important one prohibiting you from carrying a shotgun into a feed store). This seems to me to be akin to counting up federal and state zoning ordnances and then claiming that there are only 300 laws about zoning in the US.\n\n So Lott claims that there is an analyis of a BATF report that says that there are 20,000 gun laws. Anybody know where this analysis can be found? And the authors of the 300 gun law study said that the NRA has convinced most state legislatures to pass laws which automatically invalidate all local gun laws. So in recent years it wouldn't be surprising if the number of gun laws has been dramatically reduced. \n \n \n\n Some in S Africa do not think their gun laws are strict enough. Some in New york city do not think THEIR gun laws are strict enough. This just shows that there are XXXXXX everywhere.\n In S Africa, you are required to have a permit to own any firearm. Any criminal activity, or \"questionable\" associations result in the refusal of a permit. Over 60% of permit applications are denied, and penalties for posession of an unlicensed weapon are severe. YET, unlicensed weapons outnumber licensed ones.\n\n Well it still sounds like you can own quite a few guns (4 guns)-\n \"The new gun law also limits individuals to one handgun for self-defence and a maximum of three additional firearms for hunting and sport shooting. Would-be gun owners must justify their need for a weapon and undergo competency training and background checks, which prohibit anyone with a history of substance abuse or violent crime from owning a gun. Current gun owners are required to hand over excess guns and renew their licenses under the new law.\"\n http://www.irinnews.org/webspecials/small-arms/53228.asp\n \n \n\n The problem with gun control laws is that they seldom contain a crime control element. Somebody who is going to rob a liquor store is not likely to stop and rethink their plan because their firearm is illegal. They are getting ready to commit a felony anyway. Nobody is going to decide NOT to murder somebody because they fear being charged with illegal posession of a firearm.\n Gun laws essentially only apply to law abiding citizens. A criminal is, by definition, somebody who does not obey the law. You cannot legislate away criminality.\n\n It may not affect their decision to murder someone but it can affect whether or not they are successful. Do you think you are more likely to escape if the criminal who is trying to murder you is armed or not armed? Deciding to murder someone doesn't necessarily mean you will be successful. If a criminal already owns a firearm a gun law probably won't stop you him from committing a crime with it (unless he is afraid that more time will be added to his sentence if he gets caught). But it may prevent him from obtaining a gun in the first place. Why are so many \"gun crimes\" committed with replica guns in the UK? Is it because the criminals there have a difficult time obtaining real guns and so they often settle for replica guns? Saying that gun laws only apply to law abiding citizens doesn't explain why certain nations have very low levels of criminal gun use.",

I was asking about NY police enforcing gun laws. \n \n\n The problem with your base theory is simply that facts do not bear them out. We currently have more guns per capita than we have at any time since the 1920's, and crime continues to decline. Not too long ago, the idiotic assault weapon ban and high cap magazine ban died, and crime continued to decline. A movement has virtually swept the nation to allow concealed carry.....39 state either have \"shall issue\" legislation or no restirctions at all, and crime continues to decline (and decline at a greater rate in states with concealed carry).\n\n The arguments of gun control advocates is that although the total number of guns has increased in society the percentage of people owning guns has declined. A quick google search revealed:\n \"The proportion of American households that keep firearms appears to be declining.\"\n http://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles/165476.txt\n The assault weapons ban dealt with weapons that were rarely used in gun crimes so you wouldn't expect it to have a big effect statistically on gun crime. But maybe it saved a few lives. And last I heard there wasn't any agreement among scholars about the effects of CCW. If you are going to claim that states with shall issue laws are experiencing sharper decreases in crime then you need to back it up. Go to the Brady Campaign website and you'll find the exact opposite claim based on FBI data. \n \n\n So the number of guns is growing. The number of people carrying guns around is growing, and yet crime continues to decline. Nobody has ever actually managed to show any benifit to gun control. Either the effect is postive, or it is neutral, yet people continually push for expensive legislation that infirnges on the rights of Americans out of some ignorance based fear.\n\n What are you talking about? What rights are being infringed? As I understand, now you're claiming that the effect of gun control is either positive or neutral. Before you were claiming it was either negative or neutral. And gun control is a vague term. If a certain type of gun control is ineffective it would be illogical to conclude gun control is generally ineffective. If the medicine that the doctor gave you is ineffective it would be illogical to conclude that medicine is generally ineffective.",

   "As I understand, confiscating illegal guns from people is part of enforcing gun laws. Am I missing something?\n\n Yes, you are. The police were not out there enforcing gun laws. They were out there arresting criminals under a policy of stepped up enforcement, increased arrests, and increased prosecution of both misdemeanor and felony cases. The finding of illegal guns on criminals, while good, was incidental secondary to their arrest. It comes down to effective and efficient policing.\n \n The point is, what these yahoo's are trying to do here in Philly right now is to give themselves cart blanche on the ability to make gun laws independent of the state legislature. If these people were simply calling for increased penalty for the use of a firearm in the commission of a crime, or increased penalties for those found with illegal weapons, I would support them 100%. However, Tom Knox and his merry band of liberal whackos simply want to make it more difficult or impossible for me to legally buy a gun as a resident of Philly, or for me to legally purchase ammunition for my guns, or for me to get a CCW permit. Philadelphia is a prime example...we already have the most restrictive firearms policies in the state, yet we also have the highest crime rate. It is virtually impossible to get a CCW permit here, yet our per capita rate of gun violence puts the rest of the state to shame. Philly also does not allow open carry, something which is legal elsewhere in the state. What we need to do is take a good long look at what NYC and others did that actually reduced crime....take the criminals off the streets and put them behind bars where they belong.",

   "Crime control is a lousy excuse for gun control. The 2nd Amendment is very clear on this. It does not mention that crime control is a good enough excuse to violate gun rights. I'd like to know how the post modernist anti-gunners can justify using crime as an excuse when the 2nd Amendment is very clear. It says \"shall not be infringed\", but does not say \"shall not be infringed except for crime control\". What the F?",

The finding of illegal guns on criminals, while good, was incidental secondary to their arrest.

According to this information from the National Criminal Justice Reference Service it sure sounds like the police are out there enforcing gun laws. \n \n \"The NYPD gun strategy uses felony arrests and summonses to target gun trafficking and gun-related crime in the city. NYPD pursues all perpetrators and accomplices in gun crimes cases and interrogates them about how their guns were acquired. In a proactive effort to get guns off the streets, the NYPD's Street Crime Units aggressively enforce all gun laws. In 1996, the Street Crime Units made up one-half of 1 percent of the NYPD, but made 20 percent of all gun arrests. In 1997, their ability to enforce gun laws and make firearm arrests was enhanced by a quadrupling of the number of officers assigned to the program.\"\n http://ojjdp.ncjrs.org/pubs/gun_violence/profile19.html",

This is not \"pro-active\" gun law enforcement. This is an after the fact approach to gun law enforcement, since a crime usually must be committed prior to the cops finding the gun and being able to interrogate the perps. I agree that it is great that they are attempting to track down distributors of illegal guns, but I still hold that it was the stepped up arrest policy (see: broken window policy) that led to them finding the guns in the first place. This policy of increased policing in the community leads to the removal of criminals and illegal guns in the streets, thereby reducing crime.",
