   "there are many myths out there about history that many people do not seem to realize. i'll list a few of them. american, if you want to add any to this list or dispute any from this list, please do so. i'd like to hear what you think.\n \n First Myth: George Washington was the first president of the united states. believe it or not, Washington WAS NOT the first president. he was actually the NINTH. yes, the ninth. there were 8 other presidents before him during the times of the Articles of Confederation. John Hanson was the first president of the united states. the Articles of Confederation gave very little power to the president and they only served one year terms. that is why you never hear that John Hanson was the first president of the united states.\n \n Second Myth: the first shot of the Civil War was fired on April 12, 1861. nope, it sure wasnt. the first shot was actually fired on January 9, 1861. by January 9, South Carolina and Mississippi had already seceded from the Union. President James Buchanan tried to send troops and supplies to Major Robert Anderson, commander of the garrison at Fort Sumter. the ship that Buchanan sent was an unarmed merchant vessel. when the shore batteries at Charleston Harbor fired on the ship, it sailed away. the first shot of the Civil War was indeed fired on January 9, 1861.\n \n Third Myth: the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed slaves. no sir, it did not. the Emancipation Proclamation only freed slaves in the southern states. that meant that border states that allowed slavery but were still in the Union did not have to free their slaves. the Emancipation Proclamation was merely a tool used by Lincoln in order to make slavery the primary issue in the civil war. it was all psychological. slavery was finally abolished in 1865 with the 15th Amendment.",

   "Other history myths? Sure, why not. Let's look at the \"unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America\" (the Declaration of Independence it just the common name):\n \n Myth 4: The Declaration was a product of the European Enlightenment\n \n R.J. Rushdoony said, \"Enlightenment writitngs were known to Americans; in arguing their case for independence, American thinkers freely resorted to the thinkers who carried weight with Europeans, but this did not mean an acceptance of their framework. American thinking was essentially Christian, and its context was more theocentric than humanistic.\"\n \n Myth 5: The Declaration had a great impact on American society during the War for Independence\n \n Gary North writes, \"Very small attention was paid to it (the Declaration). It was far more widely read during Jefferson's campaigns for the presidentcy in 1796 and 1800.\"\n \n Myth 6: The Declaration was the sole work of Thomas Jefferson\n \n Steve Wilkins says, \"He (Thomas Jefferson) was the chief drafter of course. But there were four other men on the committee -- John Adams, Ben Franklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert Livingston -- and another fifty men who spent part of July 2nd and all of July 3rd revising the document. We know that the committee made at least thrity changes. Congress made some fifty-five additional alterations, including the removal of 480 words.\"\n \n Myth 7: The Declaration was signed July 4th\n \n David McCullough, recounting the events in \"John Adams,\" says, \"The actual signing of the document would not take place until Friday, August 2, after a fair copy had been elegantly engrossed on a single, giant sheet of parchment by Timothy Matlack, assistant to the secretary of Congress.\"\n \n Again, I am open to corrections and/or contradictory opinions.

   "What do you know about the idea that 1/3 of British Americans actively supported King George III against the rebels?\n \n \n I wouldn't classify that as a myth, it's pretty much common knowledge (I heard about it in 5th Grade). \n \n \nThat Geo. Washington had always wanted a King's Commission in the army, and had he been granted one might well have been in the British army against the rebels?\n \n \n While Washington did indeed try to obtain a commission in the Regulars during the French and Indian War, I don't think he would have stayed in the army when the Revolution broke out. After all, when he heard of the fighting at Lexington and Concord he prepared for battle against the British despite the fact that he had not been offered a position of leadership. \n \n \nThat if it weren't for the fact that the rebels had the support of France, Spain and Holland, the rebellion might have failed? (a fact that is seldom acknowledged by Americans who like to imagine that a few hardy backwoodsmen single-handedly defeated Britain)\n \n \n Realize of course that it would be the colonials on their own that won the Battles of Bunker Hill, Saratoga, Cowpens, King's Mountain, Trenton, Princeton and others. I would say the greatest contribution the French made would be supplies and their fleet. The colonies could not produce large amounts of gunpowder or cartidge paper and it would be the French fleet that kept Cornwallis trapped at Yorktown (well, the French fleet and the weather technically). \n \n \nThat the rebels, whilst proclaiming their wish for independence invaded Canada?\n \n \n Canada was a potential staging ground of an invasion of the colonies. As early as 1774, the colonials urged Quebec to join them against the King's oppressive ministers. The colonies saw the Canadians as an oppressed people; the Quebec Act established Quebec as a colony with no elected assembly. If the invasion of Canada had succeeded, it would not have been ruled as a conquered nation, but would probably have been brought into the Second Continental Congress.\n \n \nThat in their invasion of Canada they received no support from the French Canadians?\n \n \n Quite true. The colonials were often anti-Catholic and anti-French. After all, the French had been fighting them in 1763 and Catholics, well, that's pretty much self-explanatory. I think Ben Franklin had been slated as the governor of Quebec, had the invasion succeeded; if anyone could have diffused these tensions, it would have been him.\n \n Other Myths:\n The militia fighting on April 19th 1775 (Lexington and Concord) were not a rabble. No less than 8 times they faced the British in formation and won decisively twice (they lost twice and the other four were inconclusive). As the British retreated to Boston, the colonial general skillfully surrounded the Redcoats and harrassed them all the way back to Boston. The colonials could have destroyed the entire force, but the colonel who could have closed the last gap stopped, because he did not want to escalate the situation more than it had been by wiping out a whole brigade.\n \n Paul Revere never said \"The British are coming\" during his ride. Instead, he said \"The Regulars are out\". Doesn't have the same ring, does it?\n \n That 1/3 of the population supported the revolution, 1/3 opposed it, and 1/3 were neutral. This 'fact' is used in history books and documentaries, with it being attributed to Thomas Jefferson. While Jefferson did say it, he was talking about the French, not the American, Revolution.",

One of the taxes the colonists had to pay for was for British troops, for their own protection. But the colonists didn't want the troops there. You've also got to remember that it took what, about two to three months to cross the Atlantic back then? England might as well have been on the dark side of the moon. And by the time of the revolution you had several thousand people that were born here and had never even seen England. I'm sure that those people in particular found it hard to justify to themselves paying taxes to England especially since the colonies were self-sufficient. They didn't \"need\" England for anything, is they way the probably saw it.\n \n And, about that quote: So, because they liked the King once, they have to forever? Is this what what you're saying? People aren't allowed to change their minds?\n \n Here's the best link I can find at the moment, I'll keep searching however\n \n \n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n http://www.ushistory.org/march/phila/background.htm\n \n The British defeated the French and their Indian allies in the French and Indian War (1754-1763). The result was British control over much of North America. But the war had cost England a great deal of money and Parliament decided it was time for the Colonies to pay a share for their own defense.\n \n \n \n To raise money, Parliament passed the Stamp Act in 1765. This law required the purchase of tax stamps to buy paper.\n \n The Colonists were outraged. After years of \"Salutary Neglect\" wherein Colonial taxes were not collected by the British, the new policy was unwelcome.\n \n The Colonists had always considered themselves Englishmen. Among the rights granted to all Englishmen was a voice in Parliament -- something they didn't have. With the Stamp Act, \"Taxation without representation is tyranny,\" became a battle cry. Rioting, rhetoric, and the calling of the Stamp Act Congress quickly led England to repeal the Stamp Act.\n \n But many new taxation measures, such as the Sugar Act and Townshend Acts followed. The Americans reacted by forming organized political groups such as Committees of Correspondence and the Sons of Liberty.\n \n \n \n The people of Boston were most outspoken and violent in their reaction to taxes. They threatened and harmed British customs officials trying to collect taxes. So, the British quartered troops in Boston to protect their officials.

   "Actually that was part of the problem as well. One of the taxes the colonists had to pay for was for British troops, for their own protection. But the colonists didn't want the troops there. You've also got to remember that it took what, about two to three months to cross the Atlantic back then? England might as well have been on the dark side of the moon. And by the time of the revolution you had several thousand people that were born here and had never even seen England. I'm sure that those people in particular found it hard to justify to themselves paying taxes to England especially since the colonies were self-sufficient. They didn't \"need\" England for anything, is they way the probably saw it.\n \n And, about that quote: So, because they liked the King once, they have to forever? Is this what what you're saying? People aren't allowed to change their minds?\n \n Here's the best link I can find at the moment, I'll keep searching however\n \n \n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n http://www.ushistory.org/march/phila/background.htm\n \n The British defeated the French and their Indian allies in the French and Indian War (1754-1763). The result was British control over much of North America. But the war had cost England a great deal of money and Parliament decided it was time for the Colonies to pay a share for their own defense.\n \n \n \n To raise money, Parliament passed the Stamp Act in 1765. This law required the purchase of tax stamps to buy paper.\n \n The Colonists were outraged. After years of \"Salutary Neglect\" wherein Colonial taxes were not collected by the British, the new policy was unwelcome.\n \n The Colonists had always considered themselves Englishmen. Among the rights granted to all Englishmen was a voice in Parliament -- something they didn't have. With the Stamp Act, \"Taxation without representation is tyranny,\" became a battle cry. Rioting, rhetoric, and the calling of the Stamp Act Congress quickly led England to repeal the Stamp Act.\n \n But many new taxation measures, such as the Sugar Act and Townshend Acts followed. The Americans reacted by forming organized political groups such as Committees of Correspondence and the Sons of Liberty.\n \n \n \n The people of Boston were most outspoken and violent in their reaction to taxes. They threatened and harmed British customs officials trying to collect taxes. So, the British quartered troops in Boston to protect their officials. In 1770, the Boston Massacre occurred as British troops fired into a group of protesters, killing five of them.

To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n \n \n One of the manifestations of this conspiracy was the Quebec Act, part of the Intolerable or Coercive Acts passed after the Boston Tea Party. The act granted recognition of Catholicism in the Ohio Valley (which especially angered the Puritans). It also, however, created a government in Quebec that lacked ANY elected offices; every position would be filled by the Crown and Parliament. It had no legislature whatsoever, except a small council appointed by the King, which was to advice the governor, who was also appointed by the King.

Or am I totally confused? :p\n\n \n \n Yes, (and no) we don't directly vote for the Prime Minister. He is not a President. The nation is divided into federal electorates roughly containing the same amount of voters. Voting is compulsory.*\n \n Each electorate equals one seat. The party with the most seats wins.\n \n That is still more representative, because my vote directly elects a member of parliament -from whence the Prime Minister comes. Usually the head of a political party.\n \n The 'No' part comes about because in one of those electorates, is the guy who would be Prime Minister - someone is still voting for him to get into parliament. The head of a political party still has to run for a particular electorate... still has to win that electorate.\n \n So in effect, we're all voting for members of parliament - not the Prime Minister. Once parliament is elected the Prime Minister is usually the guy at the head of the biggest political party/grouping.\n \n When I vote for my guy to get in, in his seat, my vote still counts because by getting him in, that's one seat won for my team.\n \n The negative aspect of this is that say an electorate has 80,000 voters. All candidate 'a' needs to win in 50.1% of the vote. Any vote above that is in effect wasted - because if he gets 60%, 75% or what, it doesn't matter, because he's still won when he got 50.1%\n \n The effect of this is that over-all, a party can get more votes, but less seats... if candidate 'a' won with 70,000, and his colleagues in two other seats only got 38,000, and 36,000 (therefore loosing those seats) then that party pulled 144,000 votes out of a possible 240,000 votes - clearly they got more across the whole three seats, but win only one seat out of three - because candidate 'a' and his huge win in his own electorate didn't matter; it didn't help the other candidates to win.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n *Actually technically, as long as you turn up, have your name ticked on the register you can run off without voting.",

   "I have no idea because I haven't gotten that far in U.S. History yet.\n\n \n In the Tilden v Hayes election, Tilden won more of the popular votes. There were disputes about returns from two or three states. The committee ruling on these voted strictly on party lines in every case (giving the Republican Hayes victory) (sounds like the recent Bush victory)\n \n The Democrats were pacified by the promise that Hayes would withdraw Federal troops still occupying the South",

Well, the inaugration fell on a Sunday and Taylor was deeply religious, so that was out. So Mr. Atchnison got to sit in the big seat until Taylor was sworn in.",

   " Myth 4: The Declaration was a product of the European Enlightenment\n \n R.J. Rushdoony said, \"Enlightenment writitngs were known to Americans; in arguing their case for independence, American thinkers freely resorted to the thinkers who carried weight with Europeans, but this did not mean an acceptance of their framework. American thinking was essentially Christian, and its context was more theocentric than humanistic.\"\n\n \n That's largely a myth of a myth. The AMerican government, many of its ideals, and the ideas expressed in teh DoI and the C were from the Enlightenment, as were the ideals in the F. Revolution. \n \n Very few of the founding fathers were christians. They were atheists, agnostics, and deists for the most part. You will surely know this if you read \n the majority of their published private correspondences and what they said about the constitution and the Declaration.\n \n \n \n The British army was somehow completely incompetent and led by utter XXXXXX in the war of independence\n \n\n \n I don't know of anyone who says all most or all of their generals were incompetent. THey did have a few, however, just like the Americans, but the Americans had other advantages that made up for it. Washington, for example, wasn't very competent as a military leader.\n \n England also had some problems with logistics which hurt leadership goals. They also had the problem that they were fighting a major war around the world at the time, and they couldn't spare equipment, good generals, and money/time.\n \n \n This chap is totally lying in that quote.\n \n \n \n Myth: Communism doesn't work.\n \n 1. Communism does work, but not on a modern national scale. It's regulated to small populations and communities ideally from 20-400 or so people, especially in certain conditions.\n \n The Arara people have very communistic system, and they thrive. The major problem with Communism is that it defies human nature when applied on a large scale.",
