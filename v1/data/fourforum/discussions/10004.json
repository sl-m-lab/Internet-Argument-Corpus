   "LOL. What did you want them to do? Come out and say \"China is manipulating the Yuan but we are terrified of the consequences if those jokers on the hill try to do something about it\"?\n \n While I do not like Paulson in general, he does seem to have a grasp of our economic situation. I think they are running out of options as far as keeping congress under control, though. He managed to kill the 27% tarriff last year, but the American people seem to be catching on to the fact that despite the rosy picture painted by tame economists, there is something VERY wrong with our economy and they expect their congressmen to do something about it. Currently blame seems to be split pretty evenly between illegal immigrants and the chinese.",

   "Well I didn't expect them to be competely honest about it, but a little sense of reality would have been nice even if it was just to save face.\n I mean, the Chinese and others are also looking at this report and can only come to the conclusion that the US government comprises of people who have the intellectual capacity of a toddler.\n \n The US Treasury should have just said that the Chinese are manipulating the Yuan, but that retaliatory tariffs are utterly counterproductive and that even a child can see that (but apparently not toddlers :p).",
