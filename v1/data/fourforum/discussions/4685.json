The only thing we need is to simply aggregate pure undifferentiated VOTERS, no party, no race, no gender, no ethnicity, no class of any kind. The computer would simply group \n suitable counts of neighboring VOTERS in all areas to make up appropriate congressional districts.\n \n What gets me is why this isn't the obvious way to go? \"Bipartisan' commissions of retired judges is baloney, to put it kindly.\n \n nels96",
