   "If you could retire one of the seven deadly sins, which would it be and why? What new sin would you add?\n \n For clarification, those sins are:\n Pride is excessive belief in one's own abilities, that interferes with the individual's recognition of the grace of God. It has been called the sin from which all others arise. Pride is also known as Vanity.\n \n Envy is the desire for others' traits, status, abilities, or situation. \n \n Gluttony is an inordinate desire to consume more than that which one requires.\n \n Lust is an inordinate craving for the pleasures of the body.\n \n Anger is manifested in the individual who spurns love and opts instead for fury. It is also known as Wrath.\n \n Greed is the desire for material wealth or gain, ignoring the realm of the spiritual. It is also called Avarice or Covetousness.\n \n Sloth is the avoidance of physical or spiritual work",

   "D-e-e-e-ep, Tink.\n \n I would have to go with Envy. All the rest I can control, somewhat, but I always have a hard time with envy, but only mildly.

And even though it only lasts for a little while, it still creeps back occasionally.\n \n To put in its stead I would have to install stupidity. Ignorance can be dealt with due to its superficial effects stemming mainly from immaturity, but stupidity goes to the bone. It affects everyone that is associated with it, through that person. It builds walls and barriers between people. It slows down the flow of life and clouds the most brightest of days.

   "Hi Anastasia,\n \n I see you've qualified each one, so that it's excess which causes the problem (excessive, inordinate, etc.) Arguing for excesses of any kind puts one on tentative footing, but in response to culling the list and replacing it with something better:\n \n It's hard to imagine how lusting after your partner is inherently wrong. It would seem like a rather joyous state of affairs. \n \n It could easily be replaced with intolerance. Imagine how much better our society and other Christian societies could be with a few words about respect for all skin colors and others' traditions and values.\n \n regards",

As far as I am concerned there is only the material world, and concentrating on it requires friends to be truly effective.\n \n In its place either willful ignorance as has been stated before, or Apathy in its form of losing all empathy and concern for another. \n Ignorance will get you used by others and apathy will leave you on your own, both can easily have deadly consquence for the individual so seem to fit the bill.",
