   "These days, with race demagoguery the order of the day, sometimes even saying something outrageous just to make a point can cause quite a stir. Such is the case with former Education Secretary and 'Book of Virtues' author Bill Bennett. On his radio show Wednesday, Bennett said this to a caller:\n \n \"If you wanted to reduce crime, you could -- if that were your sole purpose -- you could abort every black baby in this country and your crime rate would go down.\"\n \n Now, this is the statement that has quite a few Democrats and their counterparts in the race-baiting business in an uproar. How could anyone say such a thing? A bit insensitive, isn't it? By itself, the statement crosses the line. But what is needed here is context. If you look at what Bennett said right after he made the remarks in question, the game changes a bit:\n \n \"That would be an impossibly ridiculous and morally reprehensible thing to do, but your crime rate would go down.\" So how did it all come up? Bennett was taking issue with the hypothesis of a recent book that concluded that crime was down because abortion was up. \n \n In other words, those complaining the loudest actually agree with Bennett. Of course, that hasn't stopped Teddy Kennedy, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and others from showing their ignorance and complaining about his remarks. Bennett struck back last night with the best quote of the day:\n \n \"I'll not take instruction from Teddy Kennedy. A young woman likely drowned because of his negligence.\" Good one! Thank God there's someone out there who has the guts to bring that up. I wonder if the Edgartown police department has spent all of the payoff money they received yet. \n \n Excerpt from : http://boortz.com/nuze/index.html",

Bennett was taking issue with the hypothesis of a recent book that concluded that crime was down because abortion was up. \n\n \n From a purely statistical argument, that's true. It would also be true if he said that crime would be reduced if we aborted ALL babies, since the majority of crime is committed by males in their teens to early thirties. Eliminate that segment of the population and crime will go down.\n \n\n In other words, those complaining the loudest actually agree with Bennett.
