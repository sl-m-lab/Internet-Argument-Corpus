Basically if you eat ordinary foods regularly in moderation and take a moderate amount of exercise then you should be OK.\n \n Too many people are too lazy to do either. Much easier to eat at a rush, food which is unsuitable as main line eating, then throw in a few supplements.",

   "Planning, patience and invesigation nto healthy food by members of American society? I think not.\n \n Food safety advocates have criticized the FDA for allowing meat manufacturers to use carbon monoxide gas mixtures during the packaging process to prevent discoloration of meat. This discoloration is an important indicator that the meat is spoiling due to bacterial growth. The United States is the only country that allows this technology. Such technology has been banned in Europe [3]. Food safety critics have suggested that the powerful agricultural lobby has used its political power to influence the FDA's approval of this process.\n \n A second criticism that food safety advocates have made against the FDA has involved their approval of certain coal tar derived food dyes such as FDC yellow 5 and 6 which are banned in most European countries. There are concerns about carcinogenicity of these food colors [4].\n \n A third criticism of FDA food safety regulations has involved the lax pesticide regulations in the United States agricultural products.\n \n A fourth important criticism of FDA food safety regulations has involved the FDA approval of the use of bovine growth hormone in dairy cows. This hormone increases milk production in cows but critics have pointed out that there was a surplus of milk production even before the use of bovine growth hormone. There is some evidence that BGH increases levels of IGF-1 in cow milk which can promote the growth of cancers in humans [5].\n \n A fifth important criticism of FDA food safety regulations has involved the use of growth enhancing agents in cows which includes the use of antibiotics. The use of antibiotics are believed to be the primary cause for the development of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria which pose a real threat to mankind [6] .",
