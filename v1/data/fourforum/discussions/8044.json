   "Beltane or Bealtaine (Irish language) - Bealltainn (Scottish Gaelic) is an ancient Gaelic holiday celebrated around May 1. \n \n It is a cross-quarter day, marking the midpoint in the Sun's progress between the vernal equinox and summer solstice. The astronomical date for this midpoint is slightly later, around May 5 depending on the year. The festival marked the beginning of the pastoral summer season when the herds of livestock were driven out to summer pastures and mountain grazing lands. The lighting of bonfires on Oidhche Bhealtaine / \"the eve of Bealtaine\" on mountains and hills of ritual and political significance was one of the main activities of the festival.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=8834",
