   "A New York Times opinion section piece by Stanley Fish, on why Hillary Rodham Clinton is more electable than Barack Obama.\n \n ----------------\n \n March 2, 2008, 9:35 pm\n \n Why McCain Would Vote For Obama\n by Stanley Fish\n \n If it is McCain vs. Obama in the general election, look for something to happen that was unthinkable only a short time ago. The Iraq War will become a Republican plus.\n \n The reason is that McCain's position on the war, as on so many other issues, looks in (at least) two directions.\n \n On the one hand, he voted to authorize the invasion. On the other, he consistently disagreed with the administration's prosecution of the war in general and with the judgment of defense Secretary Rumsfeld in particular. And on the third hand, he advocated for a course of action that was at last implemented in the so-called \"surge,\" and with some success.\n \n So, at any moment, he would be able to present himself as a strong patriot, and at another moment as a critic of the hard-line hawks, and at still another as a hard-line hawk with more experience and military knowledge than the others. And, depending on which position he was occupying, he could deny that he was an uncritical supporter of the war or that he was inattentive to the needs of the troops, or that he had nothing positive to offer.\n \n Meanwhile, as McCain was nimbly moving around, Obama would be standing still, stuck in the one-note posture he has assumed from the beginning of the campaign. In the democratic primaries and caucuses, Obama's strong suit - the club he used to beat up Hillary Clinton - has been the absolute consistency of his position on the war: he would have voted against it had he been in the senate at the time; he has spoken out against it repeatedly since becoming a senator; and he has promised to end it and bring the troops home within a short time.\n \n But once McCain, and not Clinton, is his opponent, that position becomes a liability, because it can be attacked as being inflexible and without nuance. McCain can ask, Don't you see that the situation has changed in recent months, and shouldn't a responsible leader adjust his or her stance according to the facts on the ground? And he can add, I too had my doubts about the conduct of the war, but now a policy I long advocated has been put in place with good results. Moreover, by saying something like that he would be reminding the electorate that he knows how to think tactically about military strategies, while his opponent's only experience in combat has been trying to figure out how to beat Alan Keyes in the Illinois senate race, something anyone with the letter D (for Democrat) after his name would have been able to do easily.\n \n Up till now, Obama has had a free ride on the Iraq War issue because Senator Clinton has been on the defensive since the campaign began. In her desire to avoid copping to a failure of judgment and apologizing for it (as John Edwards did), she came up with an explanation - I voted to authorize the use of force, but I wasn't voting for it be actually used - that raised new questions about her credibility and made her vulnerable to the charge that her subsequent anti-war position had been adopted more out of political expediency than conviction.\n \n Like McCain, Clinton tells a complex story about her relationship to the war, but unlike McCain. she tells a story whose parts pull against one another, and she has been caught in a cul-de-sac between them.\n \n The parts of McCain's story, even with one or two twists and turns, fit nicely into a coherent narrative that brings credit to him in every chapter. I was resolute in the beginning, I demurred for a while but for good reasons, and now I am resolute again, and you can trust me because, in this area especially, I know what I'm doing. He can rehearse this narrative without apologizing for anything and then turn around to Obama and (borrowing from Clinton's attacks on him), declare: You, on the other hand, don't know what you're doing, as everything you say, not only about the war, but about the conduct of foreign policy, proves. (He and President Bush are already pushing this line in anticipation of Obama's nomination.)\n \n Indeed, every criticism Clinton has made of Obama - he lacks experience, he is all flourish and no substance, he gives shoot-from-the-hip answers to serious questions - falls into McCain's lap, ready for instant use in the general election.\n \n But, unfortunately for Obama, the reverse is not true. The criticisms of McCain made by his primary opponents - he twice voted against Bush's tax cuts, he cooperated with Ted Kennedy on immigration reform and with Russ Feingold on campaign-finance reform, he said that waterboarding was torture and should not be used, he scorned fundamentalist Christian leaders, he supported stem cell research, he opposed a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage, he expressed doubts about Samuel Alito - cannot be appropriated by Obama because these are his positions, too.\n \n With the Iraq War either neutralized or migrating to McCain's side, and with the sharp distinction on social issues blurred by McCain's heterodoxy (called apostasy by his critics from the right), Obama is left with health care (he would probably get the better of that one) and with the economy where there is in fact a genuine opposition between a firm free-trader and tax-cutter on the one hand, and a critic of Nafta whose economic policies might have the effect of raising taxes on the other. But that is a contrast that might not play too well in a general election campaign that lasts less than two months.\n \n And Obama will not even be able to saddle McCain with the legacy of an unpopular administration, given that more often than not he has been viewed as a Bush opponent, except on the war, and on that issue his loyalty to the president's policy will do him harm only with those hard-core liberals who would never vote for a Republican anyway.\n \n With Obama as his opponent, McCain has the advantage every which way. He continues to get mileage out of the straight-talk express, and at the same time he also has the political flexibility that comes along with having taken a few detours along the way, and talked out of several sides of his mouth.\n \n Of course, things could change. Obama may not get the nomination, in which case McCain's advantage with respect to the war would evaporate as he faced an opponent whose flexibility matched his own. (Clinton's refusal to apologize for her vote to authorize flips instantly and becomes a shield against a McCain attack, where before it was the target of an Obama attack.) Rumors about McCain's relationship with a female lobbyist might possibly be substantiated by new evidence. The fact of his age could work against him were he to be standing at a podium next to a younger, telegenic opponent. Obama fever may spread, not only to Clinton supporters but to independents and Republicans who become caught up in the gospel of hope and change. The youth vote might actually turn out for once.\n \n Still , I would bet that if McCain were pulling a lever in the Democratic primaries in Texas and Ohio, his vote would go into the Obama column.\n \n http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/why-mccain-would-vote-for-obama/index.html\n \n -------------",

   "An New York Times opinion section piece by Stanley Fish, on why Hillary Rodham Clinton is more electable than Barack Obama.\n \n ----------------\n \n March 2, 2008, 9:35 pm\n \n Why McCain Would Vote For Obama\n by Stanley Fish\n \n If it is McCain vs. Obama in the general election, look for something to happen that was unthinkable only a short time ago. The Iraq War will become a Republican plus.\nFor those who understand more about this war than the surface features that get made into soundbites for politicians, the war has always been a plus for Republicans. For those who equate hindsight to wise judgement, I say you are being misled by Obama's claim that it exhibited wise judgement to vote against this current war. In his favor is the fact that some parts of the war were poorly executed and that early withdrawal from Afghanistan caused a relapse in Taliban activities there.\n \n What hurt the war the most was exactly what McCain claims to have happened. Mismanagement by Rumsfeld and GWB along with an error in judgement by the generals in saying they had enough troops. We should have flooded Iraq with troops and we should been in a \"two minute warning\" mode throughout the war, not holding back until pockets of terrorists were as confined and splintered as they now are.\n \n Obama cannot argue, but can only speculate about what would have happened had we not gone to war in Afghanistan or Iraq. He is merely counting on hindsight to falsely claim that it was a wise decision on his part to stand against the war and an unwise decision to support what turned out to be a larger struggle with a larger cost than first thought.\n \n The decision to go to war was made by a vote of many people, based on lies from Saddam and his history of deception and barbarian behavior.\n \n A goal of the US was to depose Saddam...voted on and signed by Bill Clilnton.\n \n \n \n \n\n The reason is that McCain's position on the war, as on so many other issues, looks in (at least) two directions.\n \n On the one hand, he voted to authorize the invasion. On the other, he consistently disagreed with the administration's prosecution of the war in general and with the judgment of defense Secretary Rumsfeld in particular. And on the third hand, he advocated for a course of action that was at last implemented in the so-called \"surge,\" and with some success.\n...and he has said something about possibly being there for another 100 years. This has been improperly interpreted by the Obama side to mean that McCain wants to be there for another 100 years. \n \n We're still in Germany...not fighting. We're still in Korea...not fighting. I see no harm in being in Iraq 60 or 100 years from now...as friends.\n \n \n\n \n So, at any moment, he would be able to present himself as a strong patriot, and at another moment as a critic of the hard-line hawks, and at still another as a hard-line hawk with more experience and military knowledge than the others. And, depending on which position he was occupying, he could deny that he was an uncritical supporter of the war or that he was inattentive to the needs of the troops, or that he had nothing positive to offer.\n \n Meanwhile, as McCain was nimbly moving around, Obama would be standing still, stuck in the one-note posture he has assumed from the beginning of the campaign. In the democratic primaries and caucuses, Obama's strong suit - the club he used to beat up Hillary Clinton - has been the absolute consistency of his position on the war: he would have voted against it had he been in the senate at the time; he has spoken out against it repeatedly since becoming a senator; and he has promised to end it and bring the troops home within a short time.\n...and he cannot state with any assurance what will happen if we withdraw suddenly and completely. He does not realize what an unwise decision that would be.\n \n \n \n \n\n But once McCain, and not Clinton, is his opponent, that position becomes a liability, because it can be attacked as being inflexible and without nuance.\n \nIt can be attacked as such regardless of his opponent.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n McCain can ask, Don't you see that the situation has changed in recent months, and shouldn't a responsible leader adjust his or her stance according to the facts on the ground? And he can add, I too had my doubts about the conduct of the war, but now a policy I long advocated has been put in place with good results.\nMcCain can use this argument against either of them. It is exactly correct. He knows more about the situation than do either Hillary or Obama. He will end the war...in the best way possible...he will WIN IT!!\n \n \n Moreover, by saying something like that he would be reminding the electorate that he knows how to think tactically about military strategies, while his opponent's only experience in combat has been trying to figure out how to beat Alan Keyes in the Illinois senate race, something anyone with the letter D (for Democrat) after his name would have been able to do easily.\n...and Hillary's experience differs how?\n \n \nUp till now, Obama has had a free ride on the Iraq War issue because Senator Clinton has been on the defensive since the campaign began. In her desire to avoid copping to a failure of judgment and apologizing for it (as John Edwards did), she came up with an explanation - I voted to authorize the use of force, but I wasn't voting for it be actually used - that raised new questions about her credibility and made her vulnerable to the charge that her subsequent anti-war position had been adopted more out of political expediency than conviction.\nEdwards did err in copping to a failure of good judgement...because it was NOT a failure of good judgement. It was a failure to execute properly after deciding to do the rght thing. Saddam was supposed to be deposed. That happened. The surge happened TOO LATE...meaning there should have been more people on the ground from the beginning.\n \n\n Like McCain, Clinton tells a complex story about her relationship to the war, but unlike McCain. she tells a story whose parts pull against one another, and she has been caught in a cul-de-sac between them.\n \n The parts of McCain's story, even with one or two twists and turns, fit nicely into a coherent narrative that brings credit to him in every chapter. I was resolute in the beginning, I demurred for a while but for good reasons, and now I am resolute again, and you can trust me because, in this area especially, I know what I'm doing.

(He and President Bush are already pushing this line in anticipation of Obama's nomination.)\n...and quite true it is that Obama is a phenomenon rather than a solution-filled candidate. He is appealing to young people and has become a fad....that may be hard to beat. Good sense does not always prevail in the USA.\n \n\n Indeed, every criticism Clinton has made of Obama - he lacks experience, he is all flourish and no substance, he gives shoot-from-the-hip answers to serious questions - falls into McCain's lap, ready for instant use in the general election.\n...as if we were not already aware of Obama's shortcomings. He is still an inexperienced, but polished politician.\n \n \n \n\n But, unfortunately for Obama, the reverse is not true. The criticisms of McCain made by his primary opponents - he twice voted against Bush's tax cuts, he cooperated with Ted Kennedy on immigration reform and with Russ Feingold on campaign-finance reform, he said that waterboarding was torture and should not be used, he scorned fundamentalist Christian leaders, he supported stem cell research, he opposed a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage, he expressed doubts about Samuel Alito - cannot be appropriated by Obama because these are his positions, too.\nYes...McCain does have some faults.\n \n \n \n\n With the Iraq War either neutralized or migrating to McCain's side, and with the sharp distinction on social issues blurred by McCain's heterodoxy (called apostasy by his critics from the right), Obama is left with health care (he would probably get the better of that one) and with the economy where there is in fact a genuine opposition between a firm free-trader and tax-cutter on the one hand, and a critic of Nafta whose economic policies might have the effect of raising taxes on the other. But that is a contrast that might not play too well in a general election campaign that lasts less than two months.\nBy election day, hopefully the general public will realize that government-run health care for all citizens will not work well.\n \n \n \n \n\n And Obama will not even be able to saddle McCain with the legacy of an unpopular administration, given that more often than not he has been viewed as a Bush opponent, except on the war, and on that issue his loyalty to the president's policy will do him harm only with those hard-core liberals who would never vote for a Republican anyway.\n \n With Obama as his opponent, McCain has the advantage every which way.

The youth vote might actually turn out for once.\n \n Still , I would bet that if McCain were pulling a lever in the Democratic primaries in Texas and Ohio, his vote would go into the Obama column.\n...and perhaps he would vote that way for the same reason I would...anybody but Hillary will do better than Hillary.",
