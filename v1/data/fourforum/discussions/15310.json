   "\"In an article published today, researchers at Harvard University review the evidence on the impact of the reforms, concluding, 'The National Firearms Agreement seems to have been incredibly successful in terms of lives saved.'\n \n \"To be specific, we've had no gun massacres since 1996, compared with 13 such tragedies during the previous 18 years. (A massacre is defined as the killing of four or more people.) Total gun deaths have been reduced: gun homicides and gun suicides had been falling gradually before Port Arthur, but the reforms in 1996 caused that decline to accelerate dramatically. In the early 1990s, about 600 Australians were dying each year by gunfire; that figure is now fewer than 250.\n \n \"A comprehensive evaluation last year by the ANU researchers Christine Neill and Andrew Leigh revealed that the reforms had reduced overall homicide and suicide rates too. In other words, gun deaths have not been substituted by other methods of homicide or suicide.\n \n \"This makes sense because you can't kill someone (or yourself) as easily with a knife as with a gun. The ANU researchers estimated that 200 deaths a year have been prevented, with an annual economic saving of $500 million. That's a $7.5 billion return on the one-off $500 million cost of the reforms to taxpayers.\n \n \"As the Harvard researchers remark, 'from the perspective of 1996, it would have been difficult to imagine more compelling future evidence of a beneficial effect of the law.' \"\n Port Arthur | Gun Laws | Massacre\n \n It makes economic sense too. A law that cost taxpayers $500 million has resulted in an estimated $7.5 billion saved.",

   "Galileo there's a great deal I could say in response to your article. However I feel that you would simply ignore it because you can't address facts that you don't like.\n \n Australia's gun ban idea cost them $500 million to implement and they have a population of 20,400,000. America has a population 15 times larger. Do you really think that if we took a cue from them we could do it for $500 million as well? Or would the cost be 15 times higher and come in at $7,500,000,000?\n \n Galileo kindly grow up and stop being foolish in nature. America is broke and in a level of debt the likes of which have never been seen before. Cities and states are being forced to cut essential services like trash pickup, street lighting and even firefighters and police officers. Where are we going to get $500 million to implement Australia-like gun control for a nation of more than 300 million people, which at the present is bordered by Mexico and involved in a brutal drug war? What would keep anyone from simply buying guns from Mexico the same way they do drugs? Are you prepared to address such possibilities?\n \n And all for what? An projected decrease of 200 deaths a year? You're going to stand up and claim that what few rights we currently have must be further restricted and infringed upon for what amounts to barely even a drop in the bucket? 200 out of approximately 12,000? Nobody will ever buy that argument or consider it acceptable. You might as well take the position of \"Make gun ownership punishable by the death penalty, it'll save at least one life a year and thus it'll be well worth it.\"\n \n Are you familiar with the standard of strict scrutiny? Do you understand that any proposed gun control law must pass the strict scrutiny test due to the Second Amendment being recognized as a fundamental right protected by the Constitution?\n \n And then we come to what might be the stupidest statement of this entire article. \"This makes sense because you can't kill someone (or yourself) as easily with a knife as with a gun.\" Whoever made this statement must not have taken biology, because there is no way such a statement could be made by someone who knows what they're talking about. Do you have any idea just how fragile the human body is? Do you know how many major blood vessels there are in the outer extremities? If a major artery is severed a person will bleed to death before an ambulance can be dispatched. If someone stabs you in the leg and hits the femoral artery then you have a life expectancy of minutes unless the paramedics are literally right there at the scene and able to close off the damaged area. You could easily die from the ambulance ride alone if you're jostled too hard.\n \n It doesn't even have to be a knife that's used, an icepick can just as easily puncture a major blood vessel or vital organ. Get stabbed in the neck with something like a screwdriver and see how good that turns out. There are far too many ways for a person to be violently murdered for you to actually suggest that banning gun ownership would somehow reduce the number of deaths that occur in this country.\n \n We understand that you and those you cite absolutely hate the Second Amendment and private gun ownership. But please do a little research before coming up with a new scheme to use against the American people. It'll save all of us a lot of time and grief.\n \n Furthermore the validity of your entire argument is highly questionable. It says right on the site page that the author is Rebecca Peters, spokesman for IANSA, the international disarmament group. You couldn't find a less credible source if you'd tried. You might as well be quoting Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin next.",

   "It appears obvious to me that the last word does not rest in the Heller opinion alone. The brunt of the nature of the RIGHT was expressed in the McDonald ruling which ended in the incorporation of the 2A into the XIVth Amendment making the right applicable to the States and all positive forms of government. The right as incorporated is now no longer about guns in the 2A but RIGHTS of citizens which demands compliance with Constitutional principles and strict scrutiny as any other right in the XIVth Amendment or BOR.\n The opponents of a Republican form of government by Constitutional law, superior to any other, is being ignored here in an attempt to undo the true depth of the incorporation and aid and abet those who also attempted to ignore the civil rights of minorities after incorporation of rights.\n Also being ignored is the expansion of rights by simply by expression of the validity of those natural rights as some try to slip back and ignore the rulings as if they never occured into their safe zone of victim disarmament. There is no ruling that support the idea of victim disarmament and the 'collective right theory', the sounding board of gun grabbers, has been refuted and disavowed. It is common for drowning people to grasp at any floatsum available to avoid drowning and irrelevance. Here, I keep seeing the lost talking points of the antis repeated time after time with much sound and fury, signifying....nothing - as the Bard has said.\n Thomas Jefferson himself defined Tyranny as a government actor doing things forbidden to others (citizens). When I see foreigners trying to disarm and deprive Americans of their birth rights that 'quite rustling in the halls' comes to mind. What does star gazer and Rebecca Peters have to say that amounts to anything when antipodeans do not even have a Constitution nor BOR nor a Republican form of government?",
