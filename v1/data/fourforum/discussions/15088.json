   "We added 192,000 jobs this month, and the unemployment rate dropped to 8.9%. \n \n We need to add 150,000 jobs a month just to keep up with population growth. \n \n This means that, like every past month that has seen a drop in unemployment, the drop is NOT the result of job creation. To see unemployment declines due to job creation we need to see 300,000 jobs a month consistently added to the economy. At that rate, in 6 months we would expect to see a roughly 1% drop. \n \n Instead the unemployment rate has been dropping because we have effectively been removing people from the workforce. For the most part it is discouraged workers...people who are available for work and want to work, but have stopped actively searching for a job because they have come to the conclusion that there are simply none out there. For the most part they are right.\n \n And it gets worse...companies are reluctant to hire people who have been unemployed for a long time. There have even been companies advertising jobs and stating that \"those not currently employed will not be considered\". I am one of them. The problem is that people sit around at home for a year or two and get used to it. They get out of the habit of getting up every morning and going to work and working hard all day in a controlled environment. This is the same problem that stay at home moms have when they try to re-enter the workforce. I have found that stay at home moms actually tend to have some excellent skillsets, they just have trouble integrating into the company culture because they have been away for so long. \n \n This is, of course, largely a problem caused by our massive quantitative easing and stimulus programs. You do not see job creation from false growth. \n \n I cant help but wonder, though, if there is not a better way to do this than the creation of millions of new \"have nots\"....people who are essentially destined to be poor drags on the rest of society. \n \n It is enough to (almost) make me embrace socialism in some form. Currently there are people/companies making billions of dollars off the QE in activities that are almost entirely non constructive. At the same time millions who actually WANT to perform constructive activities are being condemned to perpetual poverty. \n \n What is sad is that the QE and all the stimulus was sold to the American public as being for the benefit of people like that...and for the rest of us. In reality, banks have made out like bandits, and anybody who happened to already have several million dollars has done exceptionally well. You r average American, though, has just gotten the shaft.",

People have lost sight of the fact that trading paper is just swapping money...the wealth is created in the production of tangible value...you have to actually MAKE something besides paper. \n \n Our modern financial system essentially allows you to leverage relatively small amounts of capital goods (real goods...things you can hold in your hands) into huge amounts of derivatives with notional values FAR in excess of the value of the underlying goods. \n \n One of the best explanations of the dot com crash I ever hears went something like this:\n \n \"Everybody had managed to convince themselves that we were all going to get rich by passing pieces of paper back and forth with progressively larger numbers written on them\".\n \n Cant remember who said it, but it summed up the whole dot com debacle pretty well.\n \n The housing mess was not much different. I saw an analysis at one point that followed the generation of $25 billion in trash sub prime paper. The financial instruments and derivatives attached to that garbage paper had a notional value of about $190 billion and a \"street value\" of $84 billion.....but that was all based on $25 billion in securities...and trash securities at that. \n \n I cannot even count the number of times I have hears people tell me \"fundamental analysis is meaningless...all that matters is technical analysis\". Essentially what they are saying there is that the underlying, real item is meaningless, all that matters is the daily notional value of it...if we pretend it is worth $500 a share then it is......",
