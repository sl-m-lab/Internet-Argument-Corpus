   "With all of the punditry and varied opinions of the talking heads that is telling us what Obama and his congressional majority have done to deserve the lashing they are expected to receive on November 2nd, it seems everyone has lost sight of what has really outraged the average american at the most basic gut level, so I felt it was necessary to write in and remind the common voter why it is both necessary and even imperative to cleanse all Governorships, including the House and Senate of all liberal Democrats/Obamanites who endorse his socialist agenda.\n \n That is the crux of the peoples rage against this administration and the democratic majority that has carried its water at the expense of following the Constitutional principles upon which this country was founded. During the debate process of the National Healthcare debacle, the american people marched on Washington and organized in numerous states to protest the imposition of this flawed and intrusive bill on \"we the people\", but this group of militant leftists led by Pelosi and Reid completely ignored the will of the people and literally bribed, threatened or coerced any congressional or senate hold outs in order to force this bill through which they admitted they had to pass before they would even read it. At any other time in history these people would be charged as criminals for attempting to force the american people to purchase something the Federal Government determines it wants us to have so it could gain previously unheard of control over WE THE PEOPLE.\n \n What I am saying here is not only evident but obvious and provable by simply exercising some good old common sense. We have a president that is in a no holds barred war with the US Chamber of Commerce, the same CoC which is the main support system for every mom and pop small business in America since 1912. Here is a short bio of its founding. \n \n (((((QUOTE) The idea of a national institution to represent the unified interests of U.S. business first took shape when President William Howard Taft, in a message to Congress on December 7, 1911, addressed the need for a \"central organization in touch with associations and chambers of commerce throughout the country and able to keep purely American interests in a closer touch with different phases of commercial affairs.\"\n Four months later, on April 12, 1912, President Taft's vision became a reality when a group of 700 delegates from various commercial and trade organizations came together to create a unified body of business interest that today is the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. )))))\n \n Having been reminded of these historical facts and knowing full well of our marxist presidents animosity toward this organization, let's now look at organizations he has no problem with at all. I'm sure we all remember the very successful march on Washington on 8/12 promoted by Glenn Beck where a solid 500,000 americans with no political group affiliations gathered from all parts of our country to promote the principle of restoring honor to America, well, the militant left felt it was necessary to respond to this very successful and peaceful event where no arrests were made or trash left behind so with the help of the whitehouse, America's most extreme organizations from the American Communist Party, the American Socialist Party, SEIU, ACORN and around 400 more militant groups gathered their members which resulted in trashing Washington DC's Mall and only producing a crowd of around 150,000 America hating militants who seek to destroy the country our founders envisioned rather than preserving it for future generations. \n \n Shockingly, our president has no problem with the American Communist Party or the American Socialist Party as he does with the American Chamber of Commerce since his administration backed and supported the 10/10 event. This is why common Democrats, Independents and normally uninvolved Republicans are so rabidly involved in opposing Democrats at every level of the State and Federal political spectrum for these midterm elections. Because we all realize our very republic is at stake. This President intends to dismantle our America and before he can complete the process he must bankrupt us first. That is why he is spending money we don't have, because only in crisis mode can he carry out his radical agenda which will result with an even larger nanny state with even more power resting in the hands of an elite ruling class which he intends to lead. \n \n Now let's make this the highest voter turnout of any midterm election this Country has ever seen and send a message that we will never abandon the Republic our founders envisioned and sacrificed so much for so we can enjoy the highest quality of life in the world which this president is seeking to destroy. Remember people, a vote for a democrat is a vote for Obama and a vote for indentured servitude as he turns WE THE PEOPLE of the middle class into surfs.",

   "Don't let the republican Fear campaign fool you into voting for another Do nothing House and Senate. Like it or not Obama has saved this country from another depression and the republican party has been Embarrassed so they now are spreading vicious lies in an attempt to regain control. They have promised to undo everything Obama has accomplished in only 2 years, so ask yourself before you cast your vote\" do I want to be where I was two years ago\" I don't think anyone wants that, so Vote Democrat and send a message to the republican do nothings that Americans won't stand for their lies.\n \n The Full Article can be found here. \n http://www.neontommy.com/news/2010/10/obama-brings-positive-changes-america\n \n Obama&#8217;s Top 5 Accomplishments\n \n 1) Health Care\n \n * Reform &#8211; The President trying to give you the right to health care does not mean he is a Nazi. Instead, this landmark bill gave healthcare access to 48 million people and tax credits to 29 million people to help pay for it. In addition, health insurers can no longer discriminate against those with pre-existing condition, which means 5.6 million people will no longer be denied health care insurance as a result. Moreover, 500,000 families will be saved from bankruptcy due to medical expenses, and 3.5 million small businesses will receive tax cuts to help pay for their employee&#8217;s heath care.\n * Extension of Children&#8217;s Healthcare Insurance &#8211; Millions of low-income children will receive healthcare insurance due to a 61-cent tax increase per cigarette pack.\n * The Veterans Healthcare Budget Reform and Transparency Act &#8211; This act helped increase financial aid to severely wounded veterans and their caretakers.\n \n 2) Economy, Finances, and Jobs\n \n * The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 &#8211; Otherwise known as the controversial $787 billion stimulus plan, the federal stimulus added or saved 2.1 million jobs by the fourth quarter of 2009 and a total of 3 million jobs to date. The addition of the jobs helped boost the economy by 3.5% and decrease unemployment by 2.1%. Without this bill, America would have suffered another Great Depression.\n * Education &#8211; The Obama Treasury passed the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, which will increase Pell Grants to $5,500, $6,900 in 2019, and keeps interests rates low on subsidized student federal loans. This act will save taxpayers $87 billion over the next 10 years for not helping fund wasteful financial aid programs. In addition, $77 million will go back into education, while $10 will go to the Treasury to reduce entitlement spending.\n * Women and Pay Discrimination &#8211; President Obama approved a bill that would allow women to sue their employer&#8217;s for pay discrimination.\n \n 3) International Relations\n \n * Operation Iraqi Freedom is Over &#8211; Troops are returning home! Over 4,000 American soldiers have died, over 30,000 wounded and over 77,000 Iraqis have died. After nearly a decade of combat, casualties and many levels of pain from in both countries, the United States is finally pulling out. Operation New Dawn has begun.\n * Lowered the Nuclear Threat of Russia &#8211; President Obama met with Russian President Dmitriy Medvedev and signed an agreement that would reduce nuclear missiles in both countries. This strategic arms agreement improved the US-Russia relationship.\n * Cuban Americans and Cuba &#8211; President Obama signed a law that lifted travel and remittance restrictions for Cuban Americans so that they can travel to their home country to visit their family and send their loved ones money.\n \n 4) United States Government\n \n * Communications &#8211; I'm not talking about his eloquent speeches that got most of America to vote for him; President Obama actually made transparency a priority and published the first ever White House blog. He has also led live question-and-answer sessions. After every monumental decisions - like the stimulus plan and the increase of Afghanistan troops - he gave a thorough State of Address outlying his reasoning behind these moves.\n * Supreme Court Picks Lead To More Diversity On High Court - Obama's first pick, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, brings much needed diversity to the current Supreme Court. The Latino community is facing a high amount of discrimination due to the increase of immigration and the economy and needs a representative who will protect and understand their concerns. His second pick, Justice Elena Kagan, is just the fourth woman ever to serve on the High Court.\n * Office of Urban Affairs &#8211; America&#8217;s low-income and crime-ridden cities are now getting the attention they deserve. The Obama administration created this office in the White House to serve America&#8217;s struggling cities. From the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, $2 billion will be allocated to Byrne Grants, which funds anti-gang and anti-gun task forces.\n \n 5) Environment & Science\n \n * Forests &#8211; More than 2 million acres of wilderness, thousands of miles of rivers and multiple national parks have been put under federal protection.\n * The Automobile Industry &#8211; Yes, it was embarrassing to see America's car company, General Motors, be bailed out, but President Obama did aid in a more effective framework for recovery and has set sustainable goals. Our automobile industry was out of date and needed significant changes in order to stay competitive in this global market. The structural changes, managerial reorganization and cuts in employment helped pave the way for a more efficient industry. President Obama wants to raise the car mileage from 25 mpg to 35.5 by 2016.\n * Embryonic Stem Cell Research &#8211; President Obama lifted the Bush-era restrictions on federal funding for this research. Thanks to this lift, the first patient is being treated for their partially paralyzed spine.\n \n As you can see, President Obama has done much to improve the welfare in the United States during the past two years. Many issues have been well handled from the economy, to education, to healthcare and to international relations. Even if you disagree with this assessment, I strongly encourage everyone to vote this upcoming election. Let your voice - and your opinion - be heard.",

   "Thanks for proving for all to see how delusional you are to defend this administration as if it has accomplished any of the claims you point to in your propaganda piece. Here are 10 accomplishment his administration can claim.\n The top ten Obama administration accomplishments\n September 22nd, 2009 5:18 pm ET\n \n The top ten Obama administration accomplishments are true distinctions. They're listed here for your edification.\n \n One. President Obama has delivered the best political and social oration since President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, albeit with a corn crop of teleprompters that neither Kennedy nor King had. They memorized their speeches or worked from notes.\n \n Two. The most use of Air Force One of any of Obama's predecessors at this point in his term. In fact, during the first three months of his presidency, President Obama had flown more than did President George W. Bush during his entire first term.\n \n According to CNN, Air Force One is one of two 747-200s, both of which go up every time the president flies. One is the real deal and carries the president, while the other is a decoy. They cost the government $650 million (together) to have manufactured. Nothing inherently wrong with that. The president does need every buzzer and whistle he can get his hands on.\n \n The issue is the president is the nation's leading frequent flier, but with no free miles. In fact, it costs a bloody fortune whenever he wants to take his toy jet for a spin.\n \n CNN tells us that, in addition to the real Air Force One and the decoy, the following go with the president: two C-5 Galaxy heavy transport aircraft. They carry two limousines, both bulletproof, as well as several other limos from time to time to use to fool any would-be assassins. Sometimes Marine 1, the president's helicopter, is added. There's also a fully equipped ambulance and Secret Service cars and vans.\n \n Also flying with the president are more Secret Service agents than there are U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan, both in uniform and plain clothes.\n \n The press corp riding aboard the plane receives M&Ms in boxes with the presidential seal on them.\n \n Unfortunately, exactly what it costs for the president to hop on board to deliver another speech to a town hall meeting is classified. There's no fear that some sinister foreign power would somehow capitalize on knowing how much it costs to ship half of Washington on these pit stops across the country (the campaign is over now, Mr. President-you won. Why don't you get something done in the Oval Office, as did every president before you-oh, silly me. That's right. You have all of those czars to do that.).\n \n It's classified so none of us will find out how much the cost is lest we demand his impeachment for running up an absurd tab to push his health care reform. As you may have noted, the town hall meetings he holds are at venues at which most of those in attendance have been carefully vetted and appropriately sedated so they can't remember any tough questions to ask. If you look at the folks behind him, they look as if they're about to fall asleep. Valium in the Kool Aid, perhaps?\n \n Three: He's the first president to truly awaken and sting to fury the Silent Majority, which, after a massive gathering that stretched from the Capitol steps in Washington across the rest of the nation to California, is now busily planning the defeat of every Democrat in the House and Democrats up for election in the Senate in 2010, as well as Obama's defeat in 2012.\n \n No other president has been able to coalesce a protest movement of this size so early in his presidency.\n \n Four. Obama appointed Czar Cass R. Sunstein, whose raison d'etre for the administration is to be the Administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Like most of the other czars, she concerns herself not with what she is assigned to (information and regulatory affairs), but instead is working hard to find ways in which animals can sue humans. As a result, the president has finally given the animal-rights group PETA a reason to close its doors for good.\n \n Five. To the ranks of \"do-what-you-feel-like-doing, not-what-your-title-says-you-should-do\" czars, Obama appointed John Holdren as Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Co-Chair of the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology (or APSTDWHOSTPPCAST) for short.\n \n According to Glenn Beck, in 1977, ever-committed to the propagation of the human species, Holdren co-authored the book, Ecoscience: Population, Resources, and Environment, which states: \"population-control laws, even including laws requiring compulsory abortion, could be sustained under the existing Constitution.\" Hmmm. Sounds as if he's thinking about a new Constitution the way that's phrased-maybe The Progressive Manifesto Constitution?\n \n Even though he co-penned the tome, his office swears he \"does not now and never has been an advocate of compulsory abortions or other repressive measures to limit fertility.\" (Perhaps his left hand didn't know what the right hand was typing.) Denials of concrete evidence seems to be a serious lefty disease and it's spreading. Howard Dean spews his venom on newscasts for all to see, then when confronted with the exact same phrase denies he said it. They both seem to have problems with memory. Perhaps Holdren's co-author threw the abortion bit in at the last minute and the APSTDWHOSTPPCAST Czar missed it when he reviewed the galleys before the book went to press.\n \n For his enormous contribution to ending lives in the womb, he has single handedly silenced the Pro-Choice movement. By championing \"compulsory abortions\" (something he didn't write, but it's in the book he co-wrote), there is no need to protect choice when it comes to a woman's body. The decision already seems to be made.\n \n Six. The Obama administration has catapulted Fox News into all new ratings territory as the cable network continues to shatter weekly records. Fox now has more viewers than all other cable news channels combined (with 400,000 viewers to spare), and has all but driven a stake into the heart of MSNBC with its four remaining couch potatoes. They watch because their remote batteries wore out.\n \n MSNBC is the \"notwork\" for which Chris Matthews works and GE pushes nothing but pro-Obama drivel so, Bill O'Reilly says, it can capitalize on lucrative contracts in health care and cap-and-trade legislation. It just happens to manufacture products for both markets.\n \n Matthews, it seems, has a newly discovered disease, Obama Oration Peripheral Neuropathy. Whenever he hears Obama read from a teleprompter, his leg tingles.\n \n Matthews used to be a speechwriter for Jimmy Carter. That in itself speaks reams. Jimmy, who makes Bush look like Lincoln and Andrew Johnson a mental doppelganger for FDR, is going away the country's worst president, much less a pundit in the know.\n \n Now, as if some mind-reading oracle who can tap into the minds of all Obama dissenters, he sits on the political sidelines and tells us that the majority of those disagreeing with President Obama are racist. It's a faux fact upon which he can provide nothing to base his remarks. Even the White House disavows such notions. And if you think for a minute that as a young child he didn't use the \"N\" word, think again. He hails from rural Georgia.\n \n While Habitat for Humanity is legacy for which he deserves tremendous deal of credit, his political pontifications now indicate that, alas, it's time to put Jimmy in the home.\n \n Seven. Well brought up, Obama did his level best to honestly and humbly apologize for everything the US has done during the past eight years. His earnestness, however, was tainted by his obvious ulterior motives.\n \n First, he tried to get European leaders to follow his economic suit by creating humongous deficits via stimulus packages in their countries. He thinks it's only fair to burden future European generations with impossible debt loads the way our future generations will be burdened. It's a move toward the new world order. An attempt at a level global playing field. Second, he tried to convince the French and Germans-in particular-to send troops to Afghanistan.\n \n By groveling, he came across as a weak supplicant, not the world's most powerful man or the leader of the world's most powerful nation. We've pulled the fat out of the fire for Europeans during two world wars. Doesn't seem to matter to them.\n \n Meeting after his departure, the French and Germans must have laughed themselves silly. They refused to muck with their economies, and each sent a box of World War II bullets to our guys on the front lines in Afghanistan.\n \n Meeting after his departure, the French and Germans must have laughed themselves silly.\n \n Eight. He decided to take the high road and ordered the military to read Miranda rights to any Taliban-the people who have been trying to kill our soldiers in a real war-captured on Afghan soil. If it was on US soil, it's a whole different matter, but it's not and we're at war-not a euphemistic one like \"the drug war\"-it's a real war. In such engagements, the Geneva Convention rules, not the US Constitution.\n \n Our folks are soldiers, not cops, so nice try, but enough of \"let's make nice.\" These people are dedicated to the destruction of our country and us, and we're treating them like petty thieves? Because Obama has no military experience-or any appreciable political experience for that matter-I guess he figures that the Taliban should be treated like gangbangers, not the threat they really are.\n \n Yet secretly, according to Fox, he is still using the rendition program and sending prisoners to other countries where torture is an art form.\n \n Defense Secretary Gates might want to sit down with the Commander-in-Chief and point out the distinctions between soldiers and cops, hot wars and turf battles-that is if he can catch him between Air Force One junkets.\n \n Nine. On the foreign policy front, he made the Russians ecstatic by announcing he will not go ahead with the installation of the missile shield we promised Europe. That he announced it on the anniversary of Poland's invasion didn't help to put any salve in the now gaping diplomatic wounds of betrayal. The Poles and Czechs are furious. They're both NATO members, and NATO is one of our few allies in Afghanistan. He's sticking to the time-honored American tradition: You can trust the US-not.\n \n But the Russians are happy, even though they blasted him for \"undoing an American mistake.\" Putin understands two things: strength and force, neither of which is a part of this major blunder. And to think that during the campaign Obama swore he would install that shield. Hmmm. It's amazing what happens when the winning candidate learns about the realities of the office when he or she steps into the Oval Office. Ignorance is bliss until you say, \"So help me God.\"\n \n Ignorance is bliss until you say, \"So help me God.\"\n \n Putin now thinks we have a punching bag for a president, and God only knows what mischief he'll now feel free to engage in, especially in Iran.\n \n Ten. Obama has been giving and continues to give a huge boost to a largely ill-defined Republican Party through his gaffes, missteps, time wasting and demoralizing investigations of the CIA (our first line of defense in the war on terror) over interrogation methods used, which has been investigated twice before and the lone miscreant was sent packing to prison. Now he's dragging his feet on Afghanistan by \"carefully assessing\" a badly needed boost in troop strength there, and his ever-less popular Obamacare, with which he seems to be obsessed to the exclusion of far more pressing matters.\n \n Republicans are doing well in two bellwether state contests for governor in Virginia and New Jersey. The likelihood that the Republicans will retake the majority in the House grows more inevitable with each new blunder or outrageous decision; pretty much a daily occurrence.\n \n Best of all, when the Republicans retake the House, Pelosi is going to get a lot worse than she gave if she's lucky enough to hold onto her seat. In the Senate, Majority Leader Reid is trailing his Republican challengers by growing margins.\n \n Of course it doesn't help when Pelosi, Hoyer and Reid stupidly question the integrity, patriotism and grass roots nature of the Tea Party movement, calling participants \"Un-American.\" The Nazi analogies along are ample cause for a resounding butt kicking at the polls next year, as do the blow-up doll congressional demagogues who clearly indicated at town hall meetings that the people are working for them, not the other way around.\n \n Well done, Mr. President. You're off to a magnificent start. Do keep it up so during the next election we can restore sanity to Washington. I fear that the change you promised was perceived very differently by the populace from what you really had in mind. Your ideas, choice of czars and policies are just a tad too far to the left, which isn't good because the package you sold during the campaign had \"MODERATE\" stamped all over it. A moderate socialist ids definitely oxymoronic.\n \n Oh, and before you let Jimmy loose, I was very active in the civil rights movement in the 1960s. To paraphrase Dr. King, one of the greatest men ever to have lived, my opinions are based not on the color of your skin, nor even the content of your character. You're a nice, compassionate guy. It's the content of your emerging political character that troubles me.\n \n The top ten Obama administration accomplishments - National Political Buzz | Examiner.com",

   "Don't let the republican Fear campaign fool you into voting for another Do nothing House and Senate. Like it or not Obama has saved this country from another depression and the republican party has been Embarrassed so they now are spreading vicious lies in an attempt to regain control.\nOh my, if you are this delusional my post may be worthless but I'll try...\n \n\n 1) Health Care\n \n * Reform - The President trying to give you the right to health care does not mean he is a Nazi. Instead, this landmark bill gave healthcare access to 48 million people and tax credits to 29 million people to help pay for it.\n This isn't even true. I think the numbers are 40 million are forced to buy insurance with a limited number of those receiving subsidies. Anyone under 26 getting insurance on their parents plan will basically pay for it via increased premiums. \n \n \nIn addition, health insurers can no longer discriminate against those with pre-existing condition, which means 5.6 million people will no longer be denied health care insurance as a result.\n Last I read it was 250,000 for 2009 which probably included some double counts (people apply to more than one health insurer). Ok great then, they have a huge premium they are now forced to pay. \n \n \nMoreover, 500,000 families will be saved from bankruptcy due to medical expenses, and 3.5 million small businesses will receive tax cuts to help pay for their employee's heath care.\nThis will probably not change thanks to High deductible plans and the fact that there are no plans to reduce the cost of medicine.\n \n \nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 - Otherwise known as the controversial $787 billion stimulus plan, the federal stimulus added or saved 2.1 million jobs by the fourth quarter of 2009 and a total of 3 million jobs to date.\nThis is a BS number and I would know since I have personal experience with it. If a state get $25 billion from ARRA then they could use it on numerous things from equipment, supplies, or salaries. With equipment high enough in dollar value you have to get \"jobs created or saved\" from the supplier. This is complicated so most departments at a state used it for salaries. For example, I had to deal with one university that used it for salaries while another used it for student scholarships. Same amount of money (or close) and one has jobs saved while the other does not. Now, would the first university have fired that many people if the money was removed? No, and, in fact, we will see this come June 30, 2011 when the stimulus is gone. They often call it the \"cliff effect\". \n \n \n The addition of the jobs helped boost the economy by 3.5% and decrease unemployment by 2.1%. Without this bill, America would have suffered another Great Depression.\nYeah, things are just rosy riht now...\n \n \nEducation - The Obama Treasury passed the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, which will increase Pell Grants to $5,500, $6,900 in 2019, and keeps interests rates low on subsidized student federal loans. This act will save taxpayers $87 billion over the next 10 years for not helping fund wasteful financial aid programs. In addition, $77 million will go back into education, while $10 will go to the Treasury to reduce entitlement spending.\nThis stopped banks from profiting on a risk less investment and instead moved it to the federal government who will receive huge risks from people defaulting on their loans. Pell Grants are a joke. I deal with that mess every freakin day and it is an embarrassment. I could go on but this post is way too long as is. Just see my financial aid post in the econ forum.\n \n \nWomen and Pay Discrimination - President Obama approved a bill that would allow women to sue their employer's for pay discrimination.\nYeah, not bad.\n \n \nOperation Iraqi Freedom is Over - Troops are returning home! Over 4,000 American soldiers have died, over 30,000 wounded and over 77,000 Iraqis have died. After nearly a decade of combat, casualties and many levels of pain from in both countries, the United States is finally pulling out. Operation New Dawn has begun.\nRight on track with the previous presidents schedule...yippy...\n \n \nPresident Obama actually made transparency a priority and published the first ever White House blog. He has also led live question-and-answer sessions. After every monumental decisions - like the stimulus plan and the increase of Afghanistan troops - he gave a thorough State of Address outlying his reasoning behind these moves.\nLike failing to keep his promise about televising the health care debates?\n \n \nSupreme Court Picks Lead To More Diversity On High Court - Obama's first pick, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, brings much needed diversity to the current Supreme Court. The Latino community is facing a high amount of discrimination due to the increase of immigration and the economy and needs a representative who will protect and understand their concerns. His second pick, Justice Elena Kagan, is just the fourth woman ever to serve on the High Court.\nBecause when I think of justice I think diversity..not that justice is blind. Probably the second and third biggest failure of Obama.\n \n \nForests - More than 2 million acres of wilderness, thousands of miles of rivers and multiple national parks have been put under federal protection.\nI'm ok with this. \n \n \nAs you can see, President Obama has done much to improve the welfare in the United States during the past two years.\n yeah, it's just peachy here in the US. Record deficits, high unemployment, deflation risks, instability in the markets. We're doing great.",

Why you think the next two is going to be different is beyond me. Obama has only accelerated the destruction while prolonging the problem. It is almost hard to tell the difference in economic policy between Bush and Obama these days as you address below.\n \n \nReally funny how Bush spent a fortune on his stimulus package and no one complained then, now Obama does it and they want to impeach him... \nI complained..so you can't say no one. Yeah, a lot of people are hypocrites on this but doesn't really matter. Obama is still in the wrong as Bush was then. \n \n \nIf there was one problem with his plan it's that he didn't spend enough.\nPaul Krugman? Is that you? We've heard this argument over and over again. They said it about every economic disaster since 1893. It is NEVER enough. Just ask Japan.\n \n \n We're going to have to spend to stimulate the economy, it's worked in the past so I don't know why all the fuss over it now.\nWhen? The only time you can even remotely claim was WWII but I don't see leveling every developed nation as part of anyone's stimulus plan which is basically what we'd have to do to get those results again. You can't spend your way to growth, in a way, that is how we got here in the first place. It doesn't make sense for a company to be insolvent, why would it make sense for a government?\n \n \nI guess when we're up to our eyes in War debt it does look a bit bad to keep spending...\nExactly, YOU don't want war debt yet this is only example in history where \"stimulus\" worked. I'd agree that if we invaded China, took it over, leveled Europe and Russia, and built a bunch of factories that are easily convertible to peace time manufacturing combined with 20-30 million US deaths than we'd probably pull right out of this thing in 5-10 years. \n \n Maybe it is about time you wise up that your liberals aren't so honest either. No offense but show some intelligence and actually look at the data yourself and come up with your own argument. I'd be happy to provide raw data links if you like. Personally, if I read it on a blog, radio, or news channel than I assume it is wrong until proven otherwise. Krugman being almost always wrong.",

His weak leadership in this area makes him directly responsible for the unprecedented rise in borrowing during his time in office, an average of 13.8% per year. The increase in total debt during Reagan&#8217;s two terms was larger than all the debt accumulated by all the presidents before him combined. From 1983 through 1985, with a Republican Senate, the debt was increasing at over 17% per year. While Mr. Reagan was in office this nation&#8217;s debt went from just under 1 trillion dollars to over 2.6 trillion dollars, a 200% increase. The sad part about this increase is that it was not to educate our children, or to improve our infrastructure, or to help the poor, or even to finance a war. Reagan&#8217;s enormous increase in the national debt was not to pay for any noble cause at all; his primary unapologetic goal was to pad the pockets of the rich. The huge national debt we have today is a living legacy to his failed Neo-Conservative economic policies.

The excuse \"well they do it too\" is childish and not going to help anything. \n \n \nI agree that ALL politicians are pretty much worthless.\nI never said this. The local politicians are actually not that bad in my state. Granted I have pretty low expectations but it seems when you deal with people on a more local level you get better results. It is mainly the federal government I have a problem with. \n \n \n Won't argue that fact. But when it comes to actually getting things done from what I've seen in my lifetime it was always a Democrat that did it.\n Like I said before, delivering a failure is no better than failing to deliver. Well, maybe minimally better in some cases but you still end up in the same place. Furthermore, you must have not been around for Bush Sr or the Clinton years. Bush Sr actually worked with people and did what was needed along with pass a few important laws like the Disabilities act. It was also during the Clinton years that a republican congress worked with Clinton to control the deficit and implement some ok economic policies. Thank goodness Bill Clinton had no backbone and just rolled with the political tide...that actually served us ok for a decade.\n \n \nSo that's why I choose ton side with the Democrats, rather than do nothing Republicans. Obama may not be the greatest but considering our options I still say he was the best of what we had. Would you prefer Sara Palin ?....\nIs Sarah Palin the other option? Are you reading what you write? It's like someone asking you if you' rather be shot in right leg or the left....umm, how about neither? \n \n Don't get me wrong, I respect that Democrats took 4-5 minutes to write down some ideas on the back of a napkin while drinking scotch while the republicans were just drinking but don't you think we could get a few folks to actually come up with a real idea. Democrats often times correctly identify face value problems. What they lack is a viable and forward thinking solution. For example, Democrats correctly identified the problems with Health Care as 1) too many people are uninsured and 2) it costs too much. So the democrats decided not to see why people are uninsured or why it costs too much but instead implemented policies to fix those immediate face value problems. What we are left with is the root causes behind that problem and a solution that leaves many uninsured and raises the cost of health care. Republicans didn't show up with a plan at all and if they did it would probably have been \"lower taxes\" but they did bring up many good points about the health care bill being shortsighted. Meanwhile no one thought \"hey, both are right...we have a problem and the solution presented is XXXX\".\n \n So until you understand that both parties are really to blame here than we really can't sit back and say to ourselves \"how do we solve this mess\"? We've worked together before...seems like we could do it again.",

Like it or not, believe it or not, in this instance voting to put the republicans back in control is the worst thing America can do.

Obama reversed a Bush order requiring federal contractors to post notice that workers can limit financial support of unions serving as their only bargaining representatives.\n \n The president relaxed travel, commerce and mail restrictions on Cuba, allowing American-Cuban families unlimited visits to the island and no restrictions on the amount of remittances they can send back.\n \n The president authorized full scientific reviews of projects that might harm endangered wildlife and plants.\n \n Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced in February that the government would withdraw oil and gas leases that were offered on 77 parcels of public land for drilling near national parks in Utah by the Bush administration and that are currently in court.\n \n In his first major step in office, Obama signed an executive order closing down the detainee center at the Guantanamo Bay military facility within a year, and established new guidelines on interrogation methods and the treatment of detainees. In another order signed on the same day, Obama mandated all U.S. interrogators in all agencies to adhere to rules in the Army Field Manual, and the president also called for the shut down of CIA detention centers around the world. \n \n Breaking with Bush on health care, Obama wants to give more power back to the patients on whether health care providers should provide controversial services. The administration revoked the Bush-era \"Provider Conscience\" rule that created more regulations to prevent those who refuse to hire doctors and nurses opposed to abortion rights from receiving federal funds. The move was applauded by abortion rights advocacy groups, who say the limits restricted patients' rights. \n \n On March 18, the Obama administration formally endorsed a United Nations statement urging world leaders to decriminalize homosexuality, a declaration that less than three months ago Bush refused to sign. \n \n In his latest rollback of Bush administration policies, President Obama signed an executive order Monday lifting the 71/2-year ban on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research\n \n Not to mention the fact that he Supported Gay Rights, and a host of other things that Bush either refused to do or didn't know how to do. \n \n Do a little research and you'll find his economic policies are different too, we'll see the true Obama once he stops the bleeding caused by Bush and his Cronies...",

Here is an opinion piece that supports my opinion, maybe you'll believe it, and it's a democratic source no less. Former Obama supporters abandon Democrats, head for GOP | Capitol Hill Blue\n \n Not that this will dissuade you from spouting your denials of reality, but denials of reality they are nonetheless. This is going to be a blow out of massive historical proportions and take that as a prediction you can throw at me on Nov 3rd if I'm wrong, if you like. I predict against the common wisdom that republicans will also take the Senate along with the House which is expected by all the pundits. \n \n And I'll tell you why I believe this; the average anti-socialist Democrat, along with most Independents and Republicans understands very well that unless we control both houses we can never undo the damage that has already been done by Obama and his socialist cronies who completely ignored the will of the american people as they forced through bills in the middle of the night against the will of the American people.\n \n Are you unaware that it is unconstitutional for the US Government to force americans to purchase anything, much less health care they may not want or need? Are you completely clueless to that FACT? Why do you think a Federal Judge has just allowed the lawsuit brought by 20 STATES based on that very premise to go forward? Because he completely agreed with the argument of its UNCONSTITUTIONALITY. \n \n Now come back and defend Obama now and defend how Pelosi and Reid either bribed, threatened or outright coerced every Democrat who attempted to vote against Obamacare. Is that what you consider to be the way the system ought to work according to our founding fathers? Is that right, proper and justified as the american people were marching and calling their democratic reps and senators and demanding they NOT vote for that bill, in your opinion? \n \n I realize you wont respond directly to any of my arguments but all I ask is that you sincerely consider them and ask yourself if you truly believe the illegal, unconstitutional and heavy handed tactics applied by these leftist thugs really deserve your support and defense if you truly love this country.",

Instead, this landmark bill gave healthcare access to 48 million people and tax credits to 29 million people to help pay for it. In addition, health insurers can no longer discriminate against those with pre-existing condition, which means 5.6 million people will no longer be denied health care insurance as a result. Moreover, 500,000 families will be saved from bankruptcy due to medical expenses, and 3.5 million small businesses will receive tax cuts to help pay for their employee&#8217;s heath care.\n * Extension of Children&#8217;s Healthcare Insurance &#8211; Millions of low-income children will receive healthcare insurance due to a 61-cent tax increase per cigarette pack.\n * The Veterans Healthcare Budget Reform and Transparency Act &#8211; This act helped increase financial aid to severely wounded veterans and their caretakers.\n \n 2) Economy, Finances, and Jobs\n \n * The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 &#8211; Otherwise known as the controversial $787 billion stimulus plan, the federal stimulus added or saved 2.1 million jobs by the fourth quarter of 2009 and a total of 3 million jobs to date. The addition of the jobs helped boost the economy by 3.5% and decrease unemployment by 2.1%. Without this bill, America would have suffered another Great Depression.\n * Education &#8211; The Obama Treasury passed the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, which will increase Pell Grants to $5,500, $6,900 in 2019, and keeps interests rates low on subsidized student federal loans. This act will save taxpayers $87 billion over the next 10 years for not helping fund wasteful financial aid programs. In addition, $77 million will go back into education, while $10 will go to the Treasury to reduce entitlement spending.\n * Women and Pay Discrimination &#8211; President Obama approved a bill that would allow women to sue their employer&#8217;s for pay discrimination.\n \n 3) International Relations\n \n * Operation Iraqi Freedom is Over &#8211; Troops are returning home! Over 4,000 American soldiers have died, over 30,000 wounded and over 77,000 Iraqis have died. After nearly a decade of combat, casualties and many levels of pain from in both countries, the United States is finally pulling out. Operation New Dawn has begun.\n * Lowered the Nuclear Threat of Russia &#8211; President Obama met with Russian President Dmitriy Medvedev and signed an agreement that would reduce nuclear missiles in both countries. This strategic arms agreement improved the US-Russia relationship.\n * Cuban Americans and Cuba &#8211; President Obama signed a law that lifted travel and remittance restrictions for Cuban Americans so that they can travel to their home country to visit their family and send their loved ones money.\n \n 4) United States Government\n \n * Communications &#8211; I'm not talking about his eloquent speeches that got most of America to vote for him; President Obama actually made transparency a priority and published the first ever White House blog. He has also led live question-and-answer sessions. After every monumental decisions - like the stimulus plan and the increase of Afghanistan troops - he gave a thorough State of Address outlying his reasoning behind these moves.\n * Supreme Court Picks Lead To More Diversity On High Court - Obama's first pick, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, brings much needed diversity to the current Supreme Court. The Latino community is facing a high amount of discrimination due to the increase of immigration and the economy and needs a representative who will protect and understand their concerns. His second pick, Justice Elena Kagan, is just the fourth woman ever to serve on the High Court.\n * Office of Urban Affairs &#8211; America&#8217;s low-income and crime-ridden cities are now getting the attention they deserve. The Obama administration created this office in the White House to serve America&#8217;s struggling cities. From the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, $2 billion will be allocated to Byrne Grants, which funds anti-gang and anti-gun task forces.\n \n 5) Environment & Science\n \n * Forests &#8211; More than 2 million acres of wilderness, thousands of miles of rivers and multiple national parks have been put under federal protection.\n * The Automobile Industry &#8211; Yes, it was embarrassing to see America's car company, General Motors, be bailed out, but President Obama did aid in a more effective framework for recovery and has set sustainable goals. Our automobile industry was out of date and needed significant changes in order to stay competitive in this global market. The structural changes, managerial reorganization and cuts in employment helped pave the way for a more efficient industry. President Obama wants to raise the car mileage from 25 mpg to 35.5 by 2016.\n * Embryonic Stem Cell Research &#8211; President Obama lifted the Bush-era restrictions on federal funding for this research. Thanks to this lift, the first patient is being treated for their partially paralyzed spine.\n \n As you can see, President Obama has done much to improve the welfare in the United States during the past two years. Many issues have been well handled from the economy, to education, to healthcare and to international relations. Even if you disagree with this assessment, I strongly encourage everyone to vote this upcoming election. Let your voice - and your opinion - be heard.\n",

Free Us Now Weblog\n \"One Nation\" (Of Commies, Unions, & Other Leftist Extremists)...Trashing The Mall\n \n Today was the day that an assortment of Left-wing groups, labor unions, Democrats and the NAACCP rallied on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to \"counter\" the genuine grassroots Tea Party movement.\n Judging from the results, the astroturfers, many of whom offered free bus rides and box lunches, couldn't come close to Glenn Beck's August 28th rally, held in the same area.\n Notice the trash these conscientious environmentalists, I mean flaming hypocrites left behind.\n \n http://freemenow.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/100310_1802_disgracemar2.jpg?w=468\n \n http://freemenow.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/100310_1802_disgracemar4.jpg?w=468\n \n http://go2.wordpress.com/?id=725X1342&site=freemenow.wordpress.com&url=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F_PVyDmTkfk6s%2FTKeo9h95J-I%2FAAAAAAAAD3Q%2F6hb8qPebxqk%2Fs1600%2F10-2-10%2B034.JPG&sref=http%3A%2F%2Ffreemenow.wordpress.com%2F2010%2F10%2F03%2Fone-nation\"-disgrace-march-in-dc-makes-us-look-like-a-nation-of-filthy-haters%2F\n",

   "Bush didn't know what reality was, I think you got that one backwards.. \n You want difference?.. here's something to chew on.....\nThe below seems a little bony...let's have a look.\n \n \nLabor Laws\n Only ten days in office, Obama signed three executive orders that he said would \"level the playing field\" for labor unions and that would make unions easy to organize. Obama reversed a Bush order requiring federal contractors to post notice that workers can limit financial support of unions serving as their only bargaining representatives.\nsupport for an anti free market industry...classic bush thinking. Let's continue...\n \n \nThe president relaxed travel, commerce and mail restrictions on Cuba, allowing American-Cuban families unlimited visits to the island and no restrictions on the amount of remittances they can send back.\nUmmm, was this anyone's top priority? No real substance here. \n \n \nThe president authorized full scientific reviews of projects that might harm endangered wildlife and plants.\nPayoff not the environmental donors, classic Bush thinking. Again, not really seeing it here.\n \n \nInterior Secretary Ken Salazar announced in February that the government would withdraw oil and gas leases that were offered on 77 parcels of public land for drilling near national parks in Utah by the Bush administration and that are currently in court.\nSame thing\n \n \nIn his first major step in office, Obama signed an executive order closing down the detainee center at the Guantanamo Bay military facility within a year, and established new guidelines on interrogation methods and the treatment of detainees. In another order signed on the same day, Obama mandated all U.S. interrogators in all agencies to adhere to rules in the Army Field Manual, and the president also called for the shut down of CIA detention centers around the world. \nIsn't it still open? Not only that, this isn't anything substantive like I asked for. So he appeases a few donors...big deal. \n \n \nBreaking with Bush on health care, Obama wants to give more power back to the patients on whether health care providers should provide controversial services\nOh right, kinda like what Bush wanted to do with prescription drug plan bill. And what ended up happening? Oh yes, a bill that helped out drug companies and large insurance companies while creating barriers to entry in those industries. Great! Another example of limiting free market on the part of Bush and Obama.\n \n \nDo a little research and you'll find his economic policies are different too, we'll see the true Obama once he stops the bleeding caused by Bush and his Cronies...\nSo let me get this straight, Obama issued a bunch of policies to appease the people that paid for his campaign all of which make very little difference to 99.999% of voters (also something Bush did by the way) and on the big issues had the same thought process as Bush? Seems to me you don't get the concept of same thought different way of showing it. For example, if you have two thieves and one steals jewelry while the other steals money than to claim a huge difference between the two is crazy. This is basically what you are doing. \n \n Really nailed down the differences didn't you emoticon_frazzled\n \n Now lets look at the three biggest things in Obama's presidency to date:\n \n Stimulus\n Health Care Reform\n Oil Spill\n \n Stimulus, as you pointed out, was something Bush did too only Obama's was bigger. So that is the same. More importantly it is the thought that government can solve an economic crisis by throwing money at it that is the same between the two.\n \n Health care reform, Bush had the prescription drug plan. The important note here is that both thought the issue was not enough government involvement and both catered to big corporations (I hate saying like that because not all big corporations are bad). Both failed to fix the respective problem but instead increased cost and limited competition. \n \n Finally the Oil Spill...classic Bush with Katrina. I shouldn't even have to go into details on this one.\n \n If you want to include the Iraq War we can. Obama followed the Bush timetable for withdrawal. Another example!\n \n Come on now, too easy.",

   "After reading this thread, it's apparent to me that you Zorba haven't a clue of what you speak.\n \n \nAlthough I agree with you regarding R vs Ds from a historical perspective, this election cycle is different with the energy of the anti-socialist Tea Party which is a true grassroots effort to return America to its original principles of governing. Although I am obviously a conservative I have always been a registered independent and the independents are overwhelmingly supporting the Tea Party candidates for these midterm races.\n\n \n Not spend a lot of time on this because the term grass roots is over used and misunderstood in today's politics. Suffice it to say that the unpinned cash flow of this \"Grass root\" operation is without question the GOP establishment.\n \n \nAlso, the message has been sent to the traditional republican leadership that if they squander this coming majority by compromising with the democratic leftists who remain in Washington, then they too will be expelled in 2012. I believe the people are dedicated to finally cleansing Washington of the professional politicians who obviously are following an agenda that ignores the will of \"WE THE PEOPLE\".\n\n \n I like this one a lot. Because it graphically demonstrates how one sided you are. \"We the people\" in your definition is apparently \"Us the revolting\" . The electorate is unwaveringly split at the center line and has been for decades. It pushes one way or the other for a finite amount of time and then snaps back almost as a compulsion to the other side of the center line.\n \n The issue you bang your head up against is that the aggregate is without question a center society. \"We the People\" are not right or left, but are a total of the term which is subjective from one cycle to the next.\n \n As far as squander the opportunity goes, read more below ...\n \n \nIt is my hope that after this midterm cycle enough has been accomplished to reverse and even destroy Obama's ability to carry out his socialist agenda, but if not, I am confident that with the grassroots Tea Party movement, we can complete the purging of the enemies of the people by 2012, be they democrats or republicans.\n\n \n Now this is the best, and by far the most revealing of why you are living in a fantasy world.\n \n You guys got nothing. You think you're going to win big. You're not.. Hopefully you'll take the house so we can start blaming your incompetence for doing nothing.\n \n But you're not getting the senate, and you won't have enough votes to over-ride a veto on anything, even if you did.\n \n In short, even if you win, you lose. Obama stocks up on veto ink, you sap suckers spin heels for two years and the fickle public returns you Tea Party haters to the nothingness from which you came. As it should be.\n \n Here's why:\n \n Here's the deal on the Senate. We'll find out very early if the Dems retain the Senate. Watch Connecticut and West Virginia. If those two spots go to the Democrats, it will require the GOP to sweep everything else that is in contention. Almost certainly Boxer will stop you in California, and most probably Murray in Washington as well. Simple math.\n \n That leaves you only with the House. Several ideas have been put forth by the Republican Tea Party, the most specific of which are the \"De-fund\" and \"Repeal\" option.\n \n Repeal is a non issue due the reason I mentioned above.\n \n The other remedy, the \"Defund option\" has fatal flaws. Because of the way our spending bills work, any attempt at a program de-funding would very likely result in deadlock and a defacto government shutdown. Obviously, since nothing will move. Might want to ask you boy Newt how well that worked out for him last time. \n \n Once the social security checks stop, the senior vote will most definitely tear you to pieces and you will lose most of the independent vote. Since the Tea Party has made this option so visible to begin with, you can count on the Democrats plastering it all over every news media in the country who is stopping the SS checks. People will believe them too because you guys have spent so much time screaming that is exactly what you are going to do. Repeal, Replace, and Defund, is that not the battle cry of the Tea Party?\n \n Now, I have been a student of politics since Kennedy, and here's what I know to be a fact. The public is fickle, very fickle. perceptions change so fast it's almost funny. Now you Tea Party boys have been able to take advantage of a economic down turn and use it. Good for you guys. But you have made some critical mistakes and the GOP establishment is scrambling to try and fix it, but they know it's a lost cause long term.\n \n You have promised the moon. Just as your statement above demonstrates, your platform for electorial popularity is based almost solely on defeating Obama, and to a lesser extent the Democratic agenda in total. Problem is, you will not have the muscle to do that to any significant degree. Essentially what you will have is the SAME thing haunting Obama, lack of significant progress. You guys will make a lot of noise and stomp your feet but in the end, you'll be out voted by the GOP establishment to avoid shutdown disasters because people will demand it. Democrats would be very lucky indeed if you guys attempted a 1994 congress style shut down again. I'd say they'd almost be giddy for you to try.\n \n Your platform will have been lost in Washington politics, and in 2012 when you got to fire up the independents again, they are going to say, \"Where's my results\"? (Sound familiar?) - You're going to ask for a chance, and the silent answer will be, \"You got that in 2010\". \n \n What the mainstream voter WILL see however, is the inevitable conformance of the mighty Tea Party into the GOP machine. I have seen this so many times now (on both sides) it's like a B-Rated movie.\n \n In short Zorba, you have lost before the starting gun has even fired. And what I find funny about that is, you guys don't realize it. But rest assured, the GOP does and that is why they are so worried in terms of long range goals. They needed a knock out punch, and they are quite aware they are not going to get it.\n \n But the political winds in 2012 are going to be a lot different than today. Of that you can be certain. \n \n If times are as bad as they are today you are going to see an escalation of social needs that demand their government helps them, many of those people will be in your own ranks, and I assure you that when it comes to a choice between their family or your Tea Party, they'll drop you so fast you won't know what hit you.\n \n If times are good, the need for the emotions you want to project through the Tea Party will be rendered less important if not obsolete as people get on with the pursuit of their own Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of happiness pushing you along with people like you into background noise.\n \n History is something that won't be denied, it's a different dance, but it's always, I mean always, done to the same tune.",

That is why even democrats are rejecting him as well as Independents. \n \n \nThe issue you bang your head up against is that the aggregate is without question a center society. \"We the People\" are not right or left, but are a total of the term which is subjective from one cycle to the next.\n\n \n As I said above, I don't really have a problem with this description of the average americans political stance being in the center, The point which has obviously completely evaded you is that he has so polarized the american people with his socialist policies that he has woken up people on both sides of the political spectrum. That's why committed Democrats, be they conservative democrats have joined the Tea Party along with many who have never been politically involved at all until they watched our government ignore the will of the people and force through policies without even considering our feelings. That is why the Tea Party exists.\n \n \nAs far as squander the opportunity goes, read more below ...\n \n Now this is the best, and by far the most revealing of why you are living in a fantasy world.\n \n You guys got nothing. You think you're going to win big. You're not.. Hopefully you'll take the house so we can start blaming your incompetence for doing nothing.\n\n \n Ahh, so now you reveal your true colors. You're one of the kool-aid drinkers who worships at the throne of this wolf in ships clothing, this false messiah who will lead us to bankruptcy and destruction as a nation. \n \n I repeat my invitation for you to hang around until after the election and let's see which of us is clueless and in denial.\n \n \nBut you're not getting the senate, and you won't have enough votes to over-ride a veto on anything, even if you did.\n\n \n You talk big but you have nothing at all to support your belief since the majority of americans are intent on crippling Obama's ability to to carry out his marxist agenda. But hey, I respect your blustering since I know you have nothing else to base your opinion on.\n \n \nIn short, even if you win, you lose. Obama stocks up on veto ink, you sap suckers spin heels for two years and the fickle public returns you Tea Party haters to the nothingness from which you came. As it should be.\n\n \n WOW, you're just full of wishful thinking aren't you. Let's consider your scenario for a second and consider the repercussions if Obama is able to successfully veto every Bill Congress puts forward that the American people support. What will the consequences be in 2 years for the politicians who sided with Obama, and for Obama himself in 2012? Do you really think that the Tea Party is so fickle that they/we will blame the conservatives because Obama vetoed every bill that would have undone his damaging policies?\n \n And do you really believe that after the beating the militant leftists are going to receive on Tuesday that the remaining Democrats in either house are going to return to Washington wanting to fight the Republicans conservative agenda? Especially if they are in the minority?\n \n I predict that if Obama dares to veto bills that the American people support, getting enough Democrats to over ride his veto will be relatively easy unless they are as politically suicidal as the bunch that voted for Obamacare.\n \n \nHere's why:\n \n Here's the deal on the Senate.

Because of the way our spending bills work, any attempt at a program de-funding would very likely result in deadlock and a defacto government shutdown. Obviously, since nothing will move. Might want to ask you boy Newt how well that worked out for him last time. \n \n Once the social security checks stop, the senior vote will most definitely tear you to pieces and you will lose most of the independent vote. Since the Tea Party has made this option so visible to begin with, you can count on the Democrats plastering it all over every news media in the country who is stopping the SS checks. People will believe them too because you guys have spent so much time screaming that is exactly what you are going to do. Repeal, Replace, and Defund, is that not the battle cry of the Tea Party?\n \n Now, I have been a student of politics since Kennedy, and here's what I know to be a fact. The public is fickle, very fickle. perceptions change so fast it's almost funny. Now you Tea Party boys have been able to take advantage of a economic down turn and use it. Good for you guys. But you have made some critical mistakes and the GOP establishment is scrambling to try and fix it, but they know it's a lost cause long term.\n \n You have promised the moon. Just as your statement above demonstrates, your platform for electorial popularity is based almost solely on defeating Obama, and to a lesser extent the Democratic agenda in total. Problem is, you will not have the muscle to do that to any significant degree. Essentially what you will have is the SAME thing haunting Obama, lack of significant progress. You guys will make a lot of noise and stomp your feet but in the end, you'll be out voted by the GOP establishment to avoid shutdown disasters because people will demand it. Democrats would be very lucky indeed if you guys attempted a 1994 congress style shut down again. I'd say they'd almost be giddy for you to try.\n \n Your platform will have been lost in Washington politics, and in 2012 when you got to fire up the independents again, they are going to say, \"Where's my results\"? (Sound familiar?) - You're going to ask for a chance, and the silent answer will be, \"You got that in 2010\". \n \n What the mainstream voter WILL see however, is the inevitable conformance of the mighty Tea Party into the GOP machine. I have seen this so many times now (on both sides) it's like a B-Rated movie.\n \n In short Zorba, you have lost before the starting gun has even fired. And what I find funny about that is, you guys don't realize it. But rest assured, the GOP does and that is why they are so worried in terms of long range goals. They needed a knock out punch, and they are quite aware they are not going to get it.\n \n But the political winds in 2012 are going to be a lot different than today. Of that you can be certain. \n \n If times are as bad as they are today you are going to see an escalation of social needs that demand their government helps them, many of those people will be in your own ranks, and I assure you that when it comes to a choice between their family or your Tea Party, they'll drop you so fast you won't know what hit you.\n \n If times are good, the need for the emotions you want to project through the Tea Party will be rendered less important if not obsolete as people get on with the pursuit of their own Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of happiness pushing you along with people like you into background noise.\n \n History is something that won't be denied, it's a different dance, but it's always, I mean always, done to the same tune.\n\n \n Nice rant, you just love to define us by attempting to claim victory before even one vote has been cast. And this statement just further shows how completely irrational and arrogant you are.\n \n \nWhat the mainstream voter WILL see however, is the inevitable conformance of the mighty Tea Party into the GOP machine. I have seen this so many times now (on both sides) it's like a B-Rated movie.\n\n \n Here's the rub my ignorant friend, The Tea Party is a conglomeration of americans who are dedicated to force BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES to either represent the will of the people or be voted out of office at the next election cycle. We are taking names, keeping score and kicking butt now that we have organized and built the infrastructure. And you know what our greatest strength is? We have no central leader who speaks for us. No single man who can be bought and paid for by the powers that be.\n \n We are many many local groups who truly define the meaning of a grassroots effort which is why true power is returning to \"WE THE PEOPLE\". So for the third time in this post I challenge you to hang around until next Tuesday and lets see which of us is self deluded. I predict both houses will go conservative and if we don't take the Senate, the remaining Democrats wont dare oppose our TEA PARTY agenda in favor of supporting this lame duck marxist who's attempting to destroy this Country.\n \n I also find it humorous that you claim to have seen Tea Party type movements absorbed into the Republican Party \"so many times before\". Please name them and post links to what they represented if this claim isn't just one more example of your irrational bloviating and wishful thinking. I wont hold my breathe waiting though. emoticon_xbye",

I just truly believe that we have tens of millions of americans who although are silent, will speak loudly against Obama's agenda at the ballot box. And that means voting out those who voted for and supported that much hated agenda. So it shouldn't surprise anyone that the democrats are the focus of all of the negative energy.\n \n It is the democrats after all who hid from their constituents after ignoring their pleas to reject Obamacare, they will pay for that abandonment of the trust that was placed in them as elected officials. The leftists on this forum want to believe we are all brain damaged and like fleas can't remember from one minute to the next. Well I remember the e-mails I sent to my representatives demanding that they listen to us and vote against Obamacare, and I remember the protests and marches where thousands of other citizens sent the same message. And interestingly, no republicans need fear their votes for that legislation, here's why: \n Republicans who voted for Obamacare.\n Posted by Mr. K at 10:05 AM\n Opinionists, Pundits, Bloggers, Talk Show Hosts and Individuals have been discussing the 219 Democrats that passed Obamacare last night, however, not enough attention has been devoted to the Congressional Republicans that made this possible through their evil and unconstitutional votes last night as well.\n \n Guess what? Not one Republican voted for this legislation last night! That is the reason we are hammering our Democratic enemies this morning, instead of whining about how both parties are evil, because they're not! Our Republican brothers have fought for our freedoms! Until the cows came home last night!\n \n All 178 Republicans voted against Obamacare last night! From Congressman Lee of New York's 26th congressional district to Congressman Cao of Louisiana's 2nd congressional district, with Congressman Young of Alaska's At-Large congressional district voting against this legislation as well.\n \n Remember who our allies are: The 178 Republicans who opposed Obamacare in the House of Representatives, and the 41 Republicans who opposed Obamacare in the United States Senate, not to mention the millions of Republican, Democrat and Independent Americans who rejected Obamacare.\n Jumping in Pools: Republicans who voted for Obamacare.",

The hypocrisy is stunning.\n\n \n This is where I disagree. Social policy should and always will be a part of politics. Morality is a huge part of law and to ignore that is simply ignorant IMO. It has been this way since the founding. God and religion was a huge part of the founders lives. Furthermore, morality is probably the only backing for why we should be fiscally conservative to begin with. Without that you really have no argument. Finally, everyone imposes morality on others..it is just a matter of what you impose and on who. \n \n When I see people say they don't want Christian morality being pushed on them I often wonder if they know what that means. It means you take away the ability for people to govern as they please. I'm never against that idea. The disagreement is in what we should then govern. So now the question becomes how does a social conservative work that in with a fiscal conservative. Well, the same core values prevail. What you end up with is decisions at a local level which is what federalism is all about. People forget that we had a first amendment AND state sponsored religions because the people wanted it. I'm of the opinion that if Virginia wants to make abortion and gay marriage illegal and they should be able to while the citizens of California should be able to legalize pot and do whatever they want. In both cases the citizens are in control and I can either go to what state best complies with my way of life or I can try and convince people to change their minds. After that you only deal with the question of how to have unity in the diversity of thought and morals. I know the answer but that's too deep for the discussion here.\n \n In short, I'm not opposed to people voicing their social beliefs and wanting them enacted like they would any other law. I only think that if you believe in fiscal conservatism than you should hold those principals for your social views as well.",

But we wont know which of us is correct in our presumptions till late November 2nd or early November 3rd, so hang around long enough to see which of us actually has a handle on the peoples pulse.\n \n Talks cheap and unsubstantiated claims even cheaper. Prove the Tea Party is a Republican Party creation and then explain why so many of the entrenched leadership HAVE NOT embraced it or its conservative candidates? And don't you dare hold Dick Army up as the face of the Republican Party since he got involved in the Tea Party long after retiring from public office. \n \n Let's back up a bit, shall we? I clearly said it is my hope, here's my whole statement:Posted By Zorba \n It is my hope that after this midterm cycle enough has been accomplished to reverse and even destroy Obama's ability to carry out his socialist agenda, but if not, I am confident that with the grassroots Tea Party movement, we can complete the purging of the enemies of the people by 2012, be they democrats or republicans.\n And nothing I said claimed the majority doesn't basically remain in the center of most issues, what I have clearly said is that the majority of the American people have rejected Obama's extreme socialist agenda which is \"blindingly recognizable\" to anyone with eyes to see. That is why even democrats are rejecting him as well as Independents. \n \n As I said above, I don't really have a problem with this description of the average americans political stance being in the center, The point which has obviously completely evaded you is that he has so polarized the american people with his socialist policies that he has woken up people on both sides of the political spectrum. That's why committed Democrats, be they conservative democrats have joined the Tea Party along with many who have never been politically involved at all until they watched our government ignore the will of the people and force through policies without even considering our feelings. That is why the Tea Party exists.\n \n \n Ahh, so now you reveal your true colors. You're one of the kool-aid drinkers who worships at the throne of this wolf in sheep's clothing, this false messiah who will lead us to bankruptcy and destruction as a nation. \n \n I repeat my invitation for you to hang around until after the election and let's see which of us is clueless and in denial.\n \n You talk big but you have nothing at all to support your belief since the majority of americans are intent on crippling Obama's ability to to carry out his marxist agenda. But hey, I respect your blustering since I know you have nothing else to base your opinion on.\n \n WOW, you're just full of wishful thinking aren't you. Let's consider your scenario for a second and consider the repercussions if Obama is able to successfully veto every Bill Congress puts forward that the American people support. What will the consequences be in 2 years for the politicians who sided with Obama, and for Obama himself in 2012? Do you really think that the Tea Party is so fickle that they/we will blame the conservatives because Obama vetoed every bill that would have undone his damaging policies?\n \n And do you really believe that after the beating the militant leftists are going to receive on Tuesday that the remaining Democrats in either house are going to return to Washington wanting to fight the Republicans conservative agenda? Especially if they are in the minority?\n \n I predict that if Obama dares to veto bills that the American people support, getting enough Democrats to over ride his veto will be relatively easy unless they are as politically suicidal as the bunch that voted for Obamacare.\n \n Nice rant, you just love to define us by attempting to claim victory before even one vote has been cast. And this statement just further shows how completely irrational and arrogant you are.\n \n Here's the rub my ignorant friend, The Tea Party is a conglomeration of americans who are dedicated to force BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES to either represent the will of the people or be voted out of office at the next election cycle. We are taking names, keeping score and kicking butt now that we have organized and built the infrastructure. And you know what our greatest strength is? We have no central leader who speaks for us. No single man who can be bought and paid for by the powers that be.\n \n We are many many local groups who truly define the meaning of a grassroots effort which is why true power is returning to \"WE THE PEOPLE\". So for the third time in this post I challenge you to hang around until next Tuesday and lets see which of us is self deluded. I predict both houses will go conservative and if we don't take the Senate, the remaining Democrats wont dare oppose our TEA PARTY agenda in favor of supporting this lame duck marxist who's attempting to destroy this Country.\n \n I also find it humorous that you claim to have seen Tea Party type movements absorbed into the Republican Party \"so many times before\". Please name them and post links to what they represented if this claim isn't just one more example of your irrational bloviating and wishful thinking. I wont hold my breathe waiting though. emoticon_xbye\n",

What was interesting was that I got into a discussion with a group of 12 Republicans. I've known all these people for some time living in a fairly small community. Interesting though was that every single one of them told me they were voting for the Democrat who is running to retain her Senate Seat. I asked them why they would go against their Party affiliation to vote for a Democrat, and they all told me they had voted for her in the past because she has always helped Farmers and the people in Arkansas. I'm fairly sure That the Democrats may lose the House, but the Senate I think is Safe. So don't count your chickens before they hatch Zorba, all those polls that show the Repubs winning across the board are based on Expected vote, not the actual registered vote.

So I suggest we follow your suggestion and wait and see.

Take this afternoon for example, I personally drove 5 liberals to early voting, and have done at least that many if not more per day since early voting opened here in my state. Convincing you of anything at all is simply not worth my ROI.\n\n \n Interesting and so revealing, You are so twisted in your thinking that you equate amoral liberals/socialists as real americans while considering traditionalists like me as less than \"real american\"? Your sides anti american sentiments are why this country is spiraling into a moral and fiscal decline that we may be too late to salvage for the next generation. \n \n As for making calls and driving your 5 liberals to vote early, If this is even true, sorry, but it's too little to late.

   "I went today to an early voting station and cast my votes . What was interesting was that I got into a discussion with a group of 12 Republicans. I've known all these people for some time living in a fairly small community. Interesting though was that every single one of them told me they were voting for the Democrat who is running to retain her Senate Seat. I asked them why they would go against their Party affiliation to vote for a Democrat, and they all told me they had voted for her in the past because she has always helped Farmers and the people in Arkansas. I'm fairly sure That the Democrats may lose the House, but the Senate I think is Safe. So don't count your chickens before they hatch Zorba, all those polls that show the Repubs winning across the board are based on Expected vote, not the actual registered vote. If people get out and vote like they did two years ago, the repubs won't fair so well. It ain't over just yet.\n\n \n Not that I believe anything you say about 12 Republican farmers voting for a democrat this cycle, but arguing the point would be a waste of my time. My reason for responding is to deal with your statement that the Senate is safe. Let's say the Republicans fall one or two seats short of taking the Senate, so what? Do you really think that the remaining shell shocked Democrats will oppose the Republicans when they must vote to over ride the bills Obama vetoes that the American people want to pass? \n \n Do you really think that this remaining group of Democratic Senators who know they are coming up for reelection in 2012 want to suffer the same fate as will happen to their associates on Tuesday? It will be a very different Senate on Wednesday that it is on Tuesday and these deflated Democrats will be as malleable as warm putty regarding how receptive they will be to their constituents wishes. And that includes voting to repeal Obamacare and voting to support an across the board tax cut in order to kick start this flagging economy.",

Like I said before if you truly believe that the President of this country is a Marxist, Socialist , or Communist then you are the one who is sadly mis-informed. You didn't complain when your republican Party drove us into the ditch. \n \n You people are simply wrong. You complain about taxes, but if you actually research the subject you will find that 95% of working Americans actually Got tax cuts under the Obama Policies. You worry about High taxes for the rich, and claim with no foundation that that is the reason Corporations don't create new jobs.. Yet under Clinton when the taxes were high, corporations did in fact create jobs and unemployment was low. The Bush Tax cuts put us in the mess, and when the tax cuts end come January You'll see first hand as the economy begins to recover. You complain about Socialism, yet many of your TEA PARTY depend on medicare and Social Security to Survive. Do you not realize that the Party you support are the very ones who want to eliminate or Privatize these programs?...\n \n Do you really think, I mean really ... that the Republicans taking over the house is going to make one Iota of difference?. These people your party has chosen to replace the Rhino Repubs and the Democrats all have one thing in common, they are ALL politicians. Once they get elected and join their buddies in the house they will do nothing, just like they have done for as long as I've been alive. The only reason I support The Democrats is because they are for the Middle Class. Republicans only care about the Rich and everyone knows this to be true. \n \n I guess what I'm saying is that it really doesn't matter. The Tea Party or whatever they want to call themselves will fail miserably when/if they take the house. You see, not every candidate that is running on the republican ticket is in favor of your Movement. There are still enough Decent old school republicans together with all the decent upstanding Democrats to out number and out vote anything your little Movement can produce. You people will end up with a whole group of Freshmen Congressmen and Women who will have no choice but to follow what the REPUBLICAN party tells them and that is why your party will fail. There are Republicans who realize that once they control the house, the only way they will save the party is to Work WITH Obama.

   "Zorba, man, you have some issues there guy.\n \n Let me counter your question with a not-so-political question regarding human nature.\n\n \n Why is that Jackson? Why must you counter my question before answering my question directly? Is it because you know the answer is that no society that has embraced progressivism has evolved into a great society which lifted all of its people to the highest social and economic standard of living on Earth as has happened here in the USA? \n \n Why is it that attempting to reason with your ilk turns into a perpetual circle jerk of countering your ridiculous denials and attempted justification for a political philosophy which has never made life better for its practitioners? You defend the indefensible while accusing me of being the problem as you admit I am the traditionalist in this debate. Don't you understand what traditional means?\n traditional |tr&#601;&#712;di sh &#601;nl|\n adjective\n existing in or as part of a tradition; long-established : the traditional festivities of the church year.\n &#8226; produced, done, or used in accordance with tradition : a traditional fish soup.\n &#8226; habitually done, used, or found : the traditional drinks in the clubhouse.\n &#8226; (of a person or group) adhering to tradition, or to a particular tradition : traditional Elgarians.\n &#8226; (of jazz) in the style of the early 20th century.\n Bottom line is my world view is what made this country great, yours in the interloper philosophy that has been shown to fail and oppress the people forced to live under it anywhere it has existed. And what's worse, many of the unwashed masses who emigrated to the USA during the 19th and 20th century came to escape oppressive Governments which embraced the progressive philosophy, so why would you seek to impose this philosophy on a country you purport to love and want the best for? Simply put, what is it about progressivism that you think is superior to the traditional value systems that elevated America to become the envy of the world? CAN YOU ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS OR WILL YOU JUST COUNTER WITH MORE NONSENSE?\n \n \nHow do you, or your movement, ever expect to generate any respect from the progressive base when every other word out of your keyboard calls progressives traitors, communists, socialists and anything else other than just Americans with a different outlook than you have?\n\n \n Simply put, I don't expect to generate any respect from the militant progressive base which makes up at best only 20% of the voting population. So why should I show your pathetic political philosophy respect when all you do is condescend to us with sanctimony and an attitude of superiority? \n \n It blows my mind that progressives will say they believe in tolerance, free speech and free will when your movements early hero's preached ethnic cleansing, Eugenics, abortion and white superiority. Your ideology tells people what they want to hear as you impose an evil and diabolical belief system on them. Remember Margaret Sanger, who began intellectual life as a radical anarchist and founded Planned Parenthood which specializes in Abortion? Fabian socialists such as Sidney Webb, George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells were eugenicists who promoted ethnic cleansing, as were Harold Laski and John Maynard Keynes. \n \n The Marxist economist Scott Nearing and the feminist economist Charlotte Perkins Gilman also embraced eugenics and were all early leaders in the progressives movement. These are your heroes whether you know it or not and you will be held accountable for endorsing this vile philosophy so NO, I don't see why I should attempt to smooth talk you into believing as I do when I must first clarify why you are so wrong in your world view. \n \n \nOur biggest issue in this nation is division, that is our true number one enemy. Ideologues of every flavor are responsible for fostering this, across the board. From what I can see, you are at very least a medium for this.\n\n \n But so are you precisely what you accuse me of. And is it beyond you to see that our world views are so diametrically opposed that there is no center ground? There is no way I can compromise with your political philosophy which is evil and anti-american at its very core.\n \n \nYa know Zorba, when someone punches someone else in the mouth, there is a primal instinct to swing back. Common sense would dictate that no movement can become a defacto super party as long as insults are the core tendency. There is will always be a resistance, an under-current if you will that will oppose it to a fault and even fester to stronger and stronger proportions.\n\n \n Agreed, so you'll understand why I swing back when confronted with your insults, and the Tea Party isn't a political super party but a coalition of the masses who want our country returned to a system of governing for the people, by the people and of the people. This is what you as a progressive is opposing as you side with the elites who will only oppress you if you succeed in serving their agenda into a majority political philosophy. You sir then become the problem rather than one whom I just disagree with at that point. So your attempt to get me to not call you what I know you to be as a progressive in the name of respect or compromise wont happen because one cannot compromise with a system they have no respect for.\n \n \nProgressives are not some evil empire, Obama is not Darth Vader, and you are not Luke Skywalker. Liberal minded people just look at things differently and are just as proud of America as you are despite what you think. As long as you continue to attempt to vilify them and degrade their views, they will remain your mortal enemy and seek to undo you at every turn.\n\n \n Here's the rub though Sherlock, the bolded is exactly what progressives do at every turn anyway. Do you think your side plays fair and attempts to treat traditionalists with respect and concern? Just look around you at the politics of personal destruction the democrats have practiced this election cycle. Since they have no records to run on and cannot debate the issues americans are concerned about, they have come up with what our candidates did 20 years ago in college and high school as ammo to destroy and marginalize them. Is that debating issues with respect in your opinion?\n \n In just the last 2 weeks Joy Behar has called Sharon Engle a Bitch multiple times while Jerry Browns campaign has referred to Meg Whitman as a whore while retaining the endorsement of N.O.W. The W stands for women yet they endorse a man who will attack a successful and independent woman just because of her party affiliation. You consider this list of offense by progressives evidence of your sides civility? \n \n But when you find you cannot defeat me in the arena of ideas, you will then play the civility card as if I'm so stupid as to believe I would or have gotten the same from you. Remember, your post #1 on this forum was directed at me on this thread so you joined this forum just to attack my OP.\n \n So I repeat my original query which you completely avoided answering:\n And I will pose a challenge to you Jackson, please point to any society anywhere on Earth at any time that has followed the progressive model that has become an economic superpower on earth with the highest quality of life for its citizens as the USA has accomplished with our free market capitalist economy and spirit of entrepreneurship.\n \n Please point to the successful model we should follow and when you can't, explain to me why we should change a model that wasn't broken in the first place? Especially since our friends in western Europe are reversing their failed socialist experiment after 2 decades because it is unsupportable and reverting to our previously successful model. How do you justify us swapping places with them when they are now becoming like we were?",

You are either blind to the realities I have shared with you or you are in denial of them. Either way, you have proven you are completely unprepared to defend your political philosophy which is why I get nothing more from you but these stubborn rejections as you insist I'm wrong while proving nothing at all. \n \n \nJust go back to my original post and watch..

Go take a class in defending your political cult and then come back and debate me. Until then, we will wait for the results on Tuesday, not that I will get an admission from you as to how wrong you are about this election being about the American people rejecting Obama's militant Marxist ideology. The only reasonable result to be garnered will be that any politician who supported his agenda had to be fired yet you will no doubt refuse to admit or accept that reality. \n \n So, when all is said and done, I have defended my conservative world view while you remain in a state of perpetual self delusion and denial of reality regarding the evils and anti-american principles that define progressivism. At least my posts remain for the objective lurker to read and garner some knowledge of the facts because they will get no supporting defense of progressivism from you. And you know why that is Jackson? Because there is no rational defense for this sick and twisted ideology which ultimately results in oppressing its victims when forced on them. emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Would you please post any, and I mean any Tea Party literature that calls for the imposition of government imposed christian morality? You people spew this stuff but offer no evidence at all to support it. Besides, which Tea Party Chapter are you looking at? There are chapters in every state so which one are you accusing? And if one does define moral values in their agenda does this mean the whole National Movement is corrupted? \n\n Easy. Look at the political positions of just about every tea party candidate. Evolution is a myth, teach creation in school, no abortion even in the event of rape or incest, no embyronic stem cell research, support amendment to the constitution to ban gay marriage. I don't need to offer evidence to support these claims, the candidates do it themselves. Sharron Angle even states that she does not believe that the US constitution calls for a separation of church and state...which is really just a way of saying that she and like-minded people should be free to make laws based on religious views. That's scary. \n \n \n \nI must also say that a fiscal agenda with no moral compass attached is another recipe for social chaos. Since when are traditional moral values a bad thing? Didn't they exist in America when we were the shining light on the hill for this world? So how is possessing a moral center a bad thing? Please justify your rejection of it while proving you're the kind of person I would want my children to be around!\n\n I never stated that having moral values was a bad thing. It is what you do with those values that can be the problem. Using your morals to guide your life is great. Using your morals to dictate how someone else lives their life is not so great.

I don't need to offer evidence to support these claims, the candidates do it themselves. \n\n \n How does the personal positions of individual candidates on social issues reflect badly on the Tea Party which deals with the fiscal positions of the people they endorse? My question above was this: Would you please post any, and I mean any Tea Party literature that calls for the imposition of government imposed christian morality? \n \n This is one of the oldest tricks the opposition uses in order to demonize fiscally conservative Tea Party endorsed candidates, and that is to judge them by their social positions which are also usually conservative. The fact remains though, these are the positions of the candidates and not the Tea Party which as a national movement has steered clear of taking positions on issues like Abortion or evolution. And I repeat my challenge for you to prove the National Tea Party has taken overt positions on those issues.\n \n \n Sharron Angle even states that she does not believe that the US constitution calls for a separation of church and state...which is really just a way of saying that she and like-minded people should be free to make laws based on religious views. That's scary.\n\n \n Actually, she is absolutely right that the founders never interpreted the separation clause as the modern liberal does. Many of our most revered buildings in Washington DC were constructed in the 19th and early 20th century with the Ten Commandments and other bible passages carved into their facades, how do you explain that if the separation clause as interpreted today was seen that way back then? \n \n Because we all know that absolutely no persons or groups ever sued the government over the existence of these inscriptions on our PUBLIC BUILDINGS. Only now, in this time when progressives interpret the separation clause in a way that completely erases God from the public psyche are these buildings now offensive.\n \n \n I never stated that having moral values was a bad thing. It is what you do with those values that can be the problem. Using your morals to guide your life is great. Using your morals to dictate how someone else lives their life is not so great. I simply go by the principle of 'do no harm to anyone other than yourself'. Truthfully, I don't need a \"god\" in order to be a moral human being.\n\n \n Again, go back to our founders and the writing of the Constitution and even the Bill of Rights, these men used a biblically based moral value system to write documents which gave americans more personal LIBERTIES and personal protections under the law than any other civilization on earth. \n \n And this misinterpretation of yours starts with the establishment clause in the First Amendment which progressives refer to as the separation clause. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment refers to the first of several pronouncements in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, stating that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\". Together with the Free Exercise Clause \"... or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\" these two clauses make up what are commonly said to be the \"religion clauses\" of the First Amendment which progressives interpret to say that any biblically based considerations in consideration of laws or bills is unconstitutional. \n \n This modern separation interpretation is a complete perversion of the original intent and anyone with an objective perspective can see that as plain as day. Here, from the second paragraph of George Washington's First Inaugural Address is a quote:Such being the impressions under which I have, in obedience to the public summons, repaired to the present station, it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the universe, who presides in the councils of nations, and whose providential aids can supply every human defect, that His benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the United States a Government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes, and may enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with success the functions allotted to his charge. In tendering this homage to the Great Author of every public and private good, I assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own, nor those of my fellow- citizens at large less than either. No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the Invisible Hand which conducts the affairs of men more than those of the United States.The Avalon Project : First Inaugural Address of George Washington\n \n I rest my case...",

Read On.....Separation of church and state - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n The phrase \"separation of church and state\" is derived from a private letter written by President Thomas Jefferson in 1802 to Baptists from Danbury, Connecticut. In that letter, referencing the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, Jefferson writes:\n \n  Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\", thus building a wall of separation between Church & State.\n \n Another early user of the term was James Madison, the principal drafter of the United States Bill of Rights. In a 1789 debate in the House of Representatives regarding the draft of the First Amendment, the following was said:\n \n August 15, 1789. Mr. [Peter] Sylvester [of New York] had some doubts...He feared it [the First Amendment] might be thought to have a tendency to abolish religion altogether...Mr. [Elbridge] Gerry [of Massachusetts] said it would read better if it was that \"no religious doctrine shall be established by law.\"...Mr. [James] Madison [of Virginia] said he apprehended the meaning of the words to be, that \"Congress should not establish a religion, and enforce the legal observation of it by law.\"...[T]he State[s]...seemed to entertain an opinion that under the clause of the Constitution...it enabled them [Congress] to make laws of such a nature as might...establish a national religion; to prevent these effects he presumed the amendment was intended...Mr. Madison thought if the word \"National\" was inserted before religion, it would satisfy the minds of honorable gentlemen...He thought if the word \"national\" was introduced, it would point the amendment directly to the object it was intended to prevent.\n \n Madison contended \"Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body.\"[18] Several years later he wrote of \"total separation of the church from the state.\"[19] \"Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion & Govt in the Constitution of the United States\", Madison wrote,[20] and he declared, \"practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both, and as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.\"[21] In a letter to Edward Livingston Madison further expanded, \"We are teaching the world the great truth that Govts. do better without Kings & Nobles than with them. The merit will be doubled by the other lesson that Religion flourishes in greater purity, without than with the aid of Govt.\" This attitude is further reflected in the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, originally authored by Jefferson and championed by Madison, and guaranteeing that no one may be compelled to finance any religion or denomination.\n \n ... no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinion in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.\n \n Under the United States Constitution, the treatment of religion by the government is broken into two clauses: the establishment clause and the free exercise clause. While both are discussed in the context of the separation of church and state, it is more often discussed in regard to whether certain state actions would amount to an impermissible government establishment of religion.\n \n The phrase was also mentioned in an eloquent letter written by President John Tyler on July 10, 1843.\n \n The United States Supreme Court has referenced the separation of church and state metaphor more than 25 times, though not always fully embracing the principle. In Reynolds, the Court denied the free exercise claims of Mormons in the Utah territory who claimed polygamy was an aspect of their religious freedom. The Court used the phrase again by Justice Hugo Black in 1947 in Everson. The term has been used and defended heavily by the Court, but is not unanimously held. In a minority opinion in Wallace v. Jaffree, Justice Rehnquist presented the view that the establishment clause was intended to protect local establishments of religion from federal interference. Justice Scalia has criticized the metaphor as a bulldozer removing religion from American public life.\n \n \n So you see, once again you are trying to paint the Progressives as some kind of Evil Cult when inn fact you couldn't be farther from the truth.

I don't know what your point is since this wiki link is saying exactly what I have said above. The so called separation clause according to Jefferson, to quote him is that the legislature should \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\", thus building a wall of separation between Church & State. No where did he say that the reference of or consideration of spiritual values in deciding issues be disallowed or banned. Jefferson never said that men must check their religious or moral beliefs at the door of the state house or Congress where laws are considered. \n \n And never did he or any other legislator until this generation move to remove the ten commandments or other biblical passages from public buildings.

The merit will be doubled by the other lesson that Religion flourishes in greater purity, without than with the aid of Govt.\" This attitude is further reflected in the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, originally authored by Jefferson and championed by Madison, and guaranteeing that no one may be compelled to finance any religion or denomination.\n So, men cannot be compelled to support any religion by the Government, but nowhere is a man required to check his religion or religious values at the door of a public building where public policy is considered and created for the citizenry of the USA. That interpretation is a massive perversion of the clause in question which is promoted and insisted upon by atheists and progressives.",

   "So I repeat my original query which you completely avoided answering:\n \n And I will pose a challenge to you Jackson, please point to any society anywhere on Earth at any time that has followed the progressive model that has become an economic superpower on earth with the highest quality of life for its citizens as the USA has accomplished with our free market capitalist economy and spirit of entrepreneurship.\n\n \n There is little point to addressing this question as the answer is simplistic and something you should have known from High School classes. Assuming that high school is still in your memory, getting a little foggy for me as it was nearly a half century ago.\n \n The obvious answer is the United States. The settlers of the new world were subjects of the crown. To the crown, these settlers were progressive to the extreme and were defined by the king, in one of his many rants, as the progressive rebellion in 1768.\n \n In our own history, post establishment, the quality of life that you are so proud of is defined as the Progressive Era, in and about the turn of the 20th century. A period of industrial progression that was highly resisted at the time by that era's traditionalists as being too liberal and out of touch with their traditional values.\n \n The right of women to vote, the rights of minorities, and much of the civil rights that allow you to do what you do led to various social changes that allowed (not directly so) advancement of the United states as a super power are attributed to progressive leaning attributes of the post WWII governing model.\n \n Progressivism is not, in and of itself a political entity. In fact, other nation political parties that lean conservative also identify with the progressive label. \n \n In our history alone, Traditionalist have always resisted progressive change, and at one point lead to a lot of bloodshed. In every case, every single case in recorded history, the traditionalists were eventually defeated, as it will be in the case of your Tea Party as well. Defined time frames notwithstanding..\n \n In your tradition of being a overly obvious fool, the dictionary defines progressives as:\n \n pro\u00b7gres\u00b7sive (pr-grsv)\n adj.1. Moving forward; advancing.\n 2. Proceeding in steps; continuing steadily by increments: progressive change.\n 3. Promoting or favoring progress toward better conditions or new policies, ideas, or methods: a progressive politician; progressive business leadership.\n 4. Progressive Of or relating to a Progressive Party: the Progressive platform of 1924.\n 5. Of or relating to progressive education: a progressive school.\n 6. Increasing in rate as the taxable amount increases: a progressive income tax.\n 7. Pathology Tending to become more severe or wider in scope: progressive paralysis.\n 8. Grammar Designating a verb form that expresses an action or condition in progress.n.1. A person who actively favors or strives for progress toward better conditions, as in society or government.\n 2. Progressive A member or supporter of a Progressive Party.\n 3. Grammar A progressive verb form.\n Traditionalist values on the other hand are generally thought of as an adherence to a way of life in a stagnant manner, resistive to change, and inherently unyielding.\n \n Reagan himself, loathe to call his victory over the Soviet Union, in an of itself a progressive change, used the phrase, \"The progressive nature of capitalism defeated the communist model in the race for technology, thereby bankrupting the Soviet system.\" Yea, well, Reagan did tend to ramble ....\n \n Like all staunch traditionalist before you, your movement will go down in defeat. It is the nature of life, and in true American nature, we will not stand still simply for your nostalgic views of the way it was. \n \n As it would happen, you guys get a boost this election cycle from three sources, first the normal gains of any midterm election in the favor of the minority party, and second, from the anger that the economic condition in this nation has generated, and thirdly, your people's fixation with Obama. (Which I maintain is paramount to a love crush based on how much you talk about his ugly mug)\n \n Enjoy the boost, because once the primary factors are gone, mainstream will forget all about your pitiful movement and progressively move onto the next sequence of events in the development of the nation until the next \"Crisis\" where people like you can flourish and incite revolt, hatred, and bigotry.\n \n I got bored, figured why not blow some time in here. Dang early voting polls closed early today, couldn't get any more people in there.",

I got voter lists needing called..\n\n \n But of course, you can't respond to or refute anything I say so it must be me who is off my meds. At least you're a consistent philosophical coward who will attempt to disregard anyone you can't overwhelm with propaganda because I PROVE that's all you offer here in every post. So run away and ask others to do the same rather than continue to be barraged with facts you can't deny or refute because they are absolutely true. \n \n \n Let the vote do your talking. There is no way to argue with a fool guys, unless you can crawl down to his level and nit pit details that win you nothing and do not translate into a single vote.\n \n Spend your time getting progressives to the polls to mitigate his gains.\n\n \n Yeah, let your progressive votes do your talking. Let's see how well that works out for you on tuesday. I can't wait to hear the excuses and attacks then, when you realize you have squandered the power entrusted to this poser of a president who lied to win in 08. \n \n How long did you think these jackals could tell us one thing while betraying our trust and doing another thing before we caught on? Just remember that after only one year in power the Tea Party was already a grass roots effort that has grown exponentially over the past year to now be a national movement. So good luck on tuesday, I would suggest praying but I don't think its in you to seek a higher power. Meanwhile, I will be praying that my Lord moves people to get out and vote for a move back to a traditional America. See ya at the polls. Oh, and here's my third post you haven't responded to for the lurkers to see. \n \n \nWhy is that Jackson? Why must you counter my question with another question before answering my very direct question first? Is it because you know the answer is that no society that has embraced progressivism has evolved into a great society which lifted all of its people to the highest social and economic standard of living on Earth as has happened here in the USA? \n \n Why is it that attempting to reason with your ilk turns into a perpetual circle jerk of countering your ridiculous denials and attempted justification for a political philosophy which has never made life better for its practitioners? You defend the indefensible while accusing me of being the problem as you admit I am the traditionalist in this debate. Don't you understand what traditional means?\n traditional |tr&#601;&#712;di sh &#601;nl|\n adjective\n existing in or as part of a tradition; long-established : the traditional festivities of the church year.\n \u0095 produced, done, or used in accordance with tradition : a traditional fish soup.\n \u0095 habitually done, used, or found : the traditional drinks in the clubhouse.\n \u0095 (of a person or group) adhering to tradition, or to a particular tradition : traditional Elgarians.\n \u0095 (of jazz) in the style of the early 20th century.\n Bottom line is my world view is what made this country great, yours in the interloper philosophy that has been shown to fail and oppress the people forced to live under it anywhere it has existed. And what's worse, many of the unwashed masses who emigrated to the USA during the 19th and 20th century came to escape oppressive Governments which embraced the progressive philosophy, so why would you seek to impose this philosophy on a country you purport to love and want the best for? Simply put, what is it about progressivism that you think is superior to the traditional value systems that elevated America to become the envy of the world? CAN YOU ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS OR WILL YOU JUST COUNTER WITH MORE NONSENSE?\n \n \n \n Simply put, I don't expect to generate any respect from the militant progressive base which makes up at best only 20% of the voting population. So why should I show your pathetic political philosophy respect when all you do is condescend to us with sanctimony and an attitude of superiority? \n \n It blows my mind that progressives will say they believe in tolerance, free speech and free will when your movements early hero's preached ethnic cleansing, Eugenics, abortion and white superiority. Your ideology tells people what they want to hear as you impose an evil and diabolical belief system on them. Remember Margaret Sanger, who began intellectual life as a radical anarchist and founded Planned Parenthood which specializes in Abortion? Fabian socialists such as Sidney Webb, George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells were eugenicists who promoted ethnic cleansing, as were Harold Laski and John Maynard Keynes. \n \n The Marxist economist Scott Nearing and the feminist economist Charlotte Perkins Gilman also embraced eugenics and were all early leaders in the progressives movement. These are your heroes whether you know it or not and you will be held accountable for endorsing this vile philosophy so NO, I don't see why I should attempt to smooth talk you into believing as I do when I must first clarify why you are so wrong in your world view. \n \n \n \n But so are you precisely what you accuse me of. And is it beyond you to see that our world views are so diametrically opposed that there is no center ground? There is no way I can compromise with your political philosophy which is evil and anti-american at its very core.\n \n \n \n Agreed, so you'll understand why I swing back when confronted with your insults, and the Tea Party isn't a political super party but a coalition of the masses who want our country returned to a system of governing for the people, by the people and of the people. This is what you as a progressive is opposing as you side with the elites who will only oppress you if you succeed in serving their agenda into a majority political philosophy. You sir then become the problem rather than one whom I just disagree with at that point. So your attempt to get me to not call you what I know you to be as a progressive in the name of respect or compromise wont happen because one cannot compromise with a system they have no respect for.\n \n \n \n Here's the rub though Sherlock, the bolded is exactly what progressives do at every turn anyway. Do you think your side plays fair and attempts to treat traditionalists with respect and concern? Just look around you at the politics of personal destruction the democrats have practiced this election cycle. Since they have no records to run on and cannot debate the issues americans are concerned about, they have come up with what our candidates did 20 years ago in college and high school as ammo to destroy and marginalize them. Is that debating issues with respect in your opinion?\n \n In just the last 2 weeks Joy Behar has called Sharon Engle a Bitch multiple times while Jerry Browns campaign has referred to Meg Whitman as a whore while retaining the endorsement of N.O.W. The W stands for women yet they endorse a man who will attack a successful and independent woman just because of her party affiliation. You consider this list of offense by progressives evidence of your sides civility? \n \n But when you find you cannot defeat me in the arena of ideas, you will then play the civility card as if I'm so stupid as to believe I would or have gotten the same from you. Remember, your post #1 on this forum was directed at me on this thread so you joined this forum just to attack my OP.\n \n So I repeat my original query which you completely avoided answering:\n And I will pose a challenge to you Jackson, please point to any society anywhere on Earth at any time that has followed the progressive model that has become an economic superpower on earth with the highest quality of life for its citizens as the USA has accomplished with our free market capitalist economy and spirit of entrepreneurship.\n \n Please point to the successful model we should follow and when you can't, explain to me why we should change a model that wasn't broken in the first place? Especially since our friends in western Europe are reversing their failed socialist experiment after 2 decades because it is unsupportable and reverting to our previously successful model. How do you justify us swapping places with them when they are now becoming like we were?\n",

And John Boehner I believe is smart enough to realize he will have to work with Obama or the republicans will once again lose control in 2012. Either way it's a Win Win for the Democrats and the Obama Administration....\n\n \n Yea, the Tea Party is making it a major platform to have \"No Negotiation\" with Progressives. They've painted themselves into a corner before they even get there. And the confrontation will happen very quickly. If David Axelrod had brain one in that huge melon of a head of his, he will advise the Dems to not deal with the expiration of the Bush tax cuts in the lame duck. It is politically much better for the Dems to kick that issue into the first term of the next congress. It's strategically sound as it forces the Tea Party freshman to violate their no compromise promise right out of the starting gate as well as forces the GOP to take some ownership immediately.\n \n Problem here is, I have never had much faith in Axelrod to use his head for much other than a hat rack. That guy needs to start thinking of himself in the role of a strategist and less part of the Obama administration.\n \n For one, I fix a lot of blame on Axelrod for the pitiful showing of the Dems this cycle. As much as I hate Rove, he is a elective genius. Axelrod should have taken notes from Bush. If you notice, Bush never stopped campaigning through his first term in office. He was right out front in the public view explaining himself as he went along screwing up the nation. In contrast, Obama was a virtual hermit allowing public opinion to flow in whatever manner it wanted to.\n \n That was all Rove and IMHO Axelrod has already dropped the ball. If he can't screw his head on right and start looking at this as it should be, he's useless and needs dumped, and I mean fast.\n \n The political strategy here must be to shine the spotlight on the new Tea Party faction. Every item that forces a compromise on their part must be splashed all over the media relentlessly. That should be Axelrod's job. We'll see some hard compromise fast, in Tax cuts and the first budget. Especially true if, as expected, the Dems hold the Senate. Bills coming from the house will be mended into a upper house, lower house compromise. That is the manner differences are resolved by process. The GOP will be leaning on the Tea Party hard to gain votes to allow this to happen. These will place our hard core traditionalists in between a rock and hard place. And someone better be ready to be blasting that all over the nation.\n \n The strategy must be fine tuned once we have exact numbers. Some of it will depend how much play room cushion the house will actually have. Conventional wisdom says 55 to 60 seats to the GOP. But since most of that IS tea party, the play room for political cover will be small indeed. More seats will obviously provide more cushion, and political cover, but again, mostly Tea Party boasters. But I honestly don't see many establishment GOP wanting to be on the wheels side of a Tea Party stampede, so I don't expect many of them to stick their necks out which means it will be mostly the freshmen taking it on the chin.",

   "There is little point to addressing this question as the answer is simplistic and something you should have known from High School classes. Assuming that high school is still in your memory, getting a little foggy for me as it was nearly a half century ago.\n \n The obvious answer is the United States. The settlers of the new world were subjects of the crown. To the crown, these settlers were progressive to the extreme and were defined by the king, in one of his many rants, as the progressive rebellion in 1768.\n\n \n WOW, talk about rewriting history, are you actually telling me that the Puritans were progressives according to the standards of the day? The only thing radical about the early settlers in the US was their desire to break free from the tyranny of England. That wasn't embracing the progressive ideology, they were embracing a hunger to be free from England.\n \n \nIn our own history, post establishment, the quality of life that you are so proud of is defined as the Progressive Era, in and about the turn of the 20th century. A period of industrial progression that was highly resisted at the time by that era's traditionalists as being too liberal and out of touch with their traditional values.\n\n \n Although I agree that between the 1890s and 1920s some social advancements were made in the area's of child labor and labor laws in general, the adoption of these advances as credited to Progressives is just another rewrite of history. The fact is when allowed free rein, progressives did society more harm than good. Look at Margaret Sanger really stood for yet she is one of your movements heroes. BlackGenocide.org | The Truth About Margaret Sanger And look at what George Bernard Shaw really thought, from his own mouth, yet he is idealized today as one of your movements heroes. YouTube - George Bernard Shaw Defends Hitler, Mass Murder\n \n Also, Woodrow Wilson raised taxes on the rich just as Yobama wants to do and the american economy was in a similar doldrum as we are suffering today until his progressive policies were reversed by the next president. Only then, after a decade of deep recession did the economy turn around in 2 short years. Here from the Cato Institute is an excellent article about the futility of raising taxes on the rich. The Futility of Raising Tax Rates\n \n You can attempt to paint traditionalists as social sloths who hate progress but that is just more insanity from the lunatic fringe who fears any opposing views.",

   "He made no child left behind and the Medicare Prescription Drug look good and they were just as big piles of dung.\n\n \n Actually, you are believing leftist propaganda in condemning NCLB. The NEA hated that program and refused to adhere to it because it actually placed responsibility for failing schools on TEACHERS and held teachers responsible for failing grades and test scores. Also, all of the liberal media demonized it from day one. Here are some of the pros from this program.\n Pros of NCLB:\n State-wide standardized tests have resulted in a higher enrollment for courses in mathematics than ever before.\n Best nine-year-old scoring history since 1971.\n Academic improvement in all subject categories.\n Legislation encouraged accountability in public schools to provide additional educational options.\n Negligible achievement gap between white students and the minorities.\n Measurement based performance assessment.\n Detailed report cards explaining AYP performance, recommended para-professional or parental involvement and preferred line of curriculum and instruction practice for each child.\n Special focus on students from low-income groups and disabilities.\n Increased responsibility towards ethnic subgroups by awarding schools adequate rating and recognition for measured school performance.\n Improved instruction and classroom practices and scope for more parent involvement.\n \n One of the Bush program's great successes sent low income children to high income schools through a voucher program that insured they would get excellent educations previously unavailable to them. When Obama attempted to pull this program, low income moms from DC went public and pleaded with him not to remove their children from these superior Charter schools where they were flourishing. Some of these low income children actually attended the private school Obama's own daughters attend in Washington so he was forced to reverse himself and continue to fund this Bush program so as not to appear to be a cruel elitist. \n \n Just one more point; check this article out to remind yourself how the Teacher Unions initially criticized Obama's school proposals as Bush 3, yet you don't hear the daily and never ending criticisms of it as you did with Bush's NCLB from the leftist media. Unions Criticize Obama's School Proposals as 'Bush III' | CommonDreams.org \n \n Funding for school technology used in classrooms as part of NCLB, is administered by the Enhancing Education Through Technology Program (EETT) funding for technology used within classrooms, professional teacher training and development of online assessment interfaces.\n You must remember that just because the main stream media pummeled everything Bush said and did on an hour by hour basis for his complete second term, that doesn't mean their attacks were right, justified or valid. This is what they had to do in order to wear the american people down by 2008 so they could sell us a poser, also known as an empty suit:\n http://www.qubetv.tv/photos/66367/Obama-EmptySuit.jpg\n \n As for the medicare prescription drug program, ask any senior if that was a failure. The only critics it has again, is the leftist main stream media who condemned and demonized everything Bush did.\n \n \nYeah more Drivel from the Right... Clinton Raised Taxes on the Rich and when he left Office we had a surplus and the National Debt was actually being Paid... it was Bush and his Tax cuts that reversed the Process and put us on a quick downslide to where we are today. When the Bush Tax Cuts end we'll see the \" Futility\" when the Tax rates for the Billionaires goes back to where it was under Clinton...\n\n \n Two of the great travesties of justice in political history, not to mention rewrites of history is that Ronald Reagan was to blame for the deficit he left us with and that Bill Clinton deserves the credit for the balanced budget he left us with. \n \n Point 1 is that Reagan's tax cuts jump stared a lagging economy and injected more money into the gov't coffers than in the previous years under Carter who raised taxes. But Reagan had a democratic Congress so before they would pass his plans which benefited the economy, he had to allow their pork through also, since the line item veto didn't exist for him. It was the 94 Republican Congress that gave the President that power.\n \n Now, on to Clinton's surplus, It was the newly elected 94 Republican Congress that was fulfilling its contract with America who cut spending and held Clinton to a budget that prevented him from spending us into oblivion. So the left wing media once again rewrites history and gives Clinton credit for what never would have happened had he had a democratic congress and it demonizes Reagan because he was at the mercy of an irresponsible democratic congress that loaded each and every bill he needed with massive pork projects for their districts.\n \n As far as your lie about Bush's tax cuts leading to the deficit he left us, nothing could be further from the truth. I will admit that I was angry that we were spending a billion dollars a month on the War in Iraq but that anger turned to shock and outrage when in his first one hundred days, Yobama spent more money than Bush did in his complete 8 year term in office. And he did much of that spending through executive orders, not congressional spending so it was unfunded mandates rather than budgeted spending. This is why we are on the brink of bankruptcy.",

And he did much of that spending through executive orders, not congressional spending so it was unfunded mandates rather than budgeted spending. This is why we are on the brink of bankruptcy.\n\n \n lmao.. you seriously are one misguided individual.\n \n http://bluewavenews.com/blog/2010/07/21/republicans-extension-of-bush-tax-cuts-will-add-3-4-trillion-to-the-deficit/\n This is the secret that Republicans don&#8217;t want to talk about &#8211; their economic policies created a huge deficit and now they want to shake off responsibility for that deficit. The figure to the right has become very popular lately, it comes from a report by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. Republicans have been complaining about Democrats increasing spending, but the reality of who increased spending is very clear in this graph. The Affordable Care Act, while costly, is actually projected to cut the deficit by $127 billion.\n \n While Republicans speak out of one side of their mouths about their concern for the deficit and for our collective grandchildren, they speak out of the other side about their desire to extend the Bush tax cuts. The Bush tax cuts that will increase the deficit another $3.4 trillion. That&#8217;s trillion with a &#8216;T&#8217; &#8211; a very large one. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities explains:\n \n Bush-era tax cuts &#8212; Through 2011, the estimated impacts come from adding up past estimates of various changes in tax laws &#8212; chiefly the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA), the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA), the 2008 stimulus package, and a series of annual AMT patches &#8212; enacted since 2001. Those estimates were based on the economic and technical assumptions used when CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) originally &#8220;scored&#8221; the legislation, but the numbers would not change materially using up-to-date assumptions. Most of the Bush tax cuts are scheduled to expire after December 2010 (partway through fiscal 2011). We added the cost of extending them, along with continuing AMT relief, from estimates prepared by CBO and JCT.[23] (We did not assume extension of the temporary tax provisions enacted in ARRA.) Together, the tax cuts account for $1.7 trillion in extra deficits in 2001 through 2008, and $3.4 trillion over the 2009-2019 period. Finally, we added the extra debt-service costs caused by the Bush-era tax cuts, amounting to more than $200 billion through 2008 and another $1.7 trillion over the 2009-2019 period &#8212; over $330 billion in 2019 alone.\n \n When Republicans like Marco Rubio say that they don&#8217;t know how they would pay for tax cuts, it&#8217;s because they haven&#8217;t even considered paying for tax cuts. They don&#8217;t believe they have to pay for tax cuts. The Republicans believe that they will win majorities in November and that they will be able to extend the Bush tax cuts to their richest friends and that they will never ever have to pay for them.\n \n Republicans care so much about the deficit that they are going to ask people to go to the polls in November and vote for $3.4 trillion more in deficits, a repeal of health care reform, no help for the unemployed, and a repeal of Wall Street reform so the banks can have free rein.\n \n and here's another little bit for you...\n \n http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Issues/Taxes/2010/09/17/Bush-Tax-Cuts-No-Economic-Help.aspx\n \n \n Wake up and open your eyes Dude.. it's your Republican buddies who are responsible for the bigger part of this Mess.. When you people are willing to Admit it then maybe something can truly be done about it.",

Do you know what the word means?\n \nThat is the crux of the peoples rage against this administration and the democratic majority that has carried its water at the expense of following the Constitutional principles upon which this country was founded. During the debate process of the National Healthcare debacle, the american people marched on Washington and organized in numerous states to protest the imposition of this flawed and intrusive bill on \"we the people\", but this group of militant leftists led by Pelosi and Reid completely ignored the will of the people and literally bribed, threatened or coerced any congressional or senate hold outs in order to force this bill through which they admitted they had to pass before they would even read it. At any other time in history these people would be charged as criminals for attempting to force the american people to purchase something the Federal Government determines it wants us to have so it could gain previously unheard of control over WE THE PEOPLE.\n\n You have swallowed the swill of the Koch Brothers and Dick Armey.\n \nWhat I am saying here is not only evident but obvious and provable by simply exercising some good old common sense.

Here is a short bio of its founding.\n \n The US Chamber of Commerce is waging a full-bore war with the American people, especially people who work for a living.\n \n(((((QUOTE) The idea of a national institution to represent the unified interests of U.S. business first took shape when President William Howard Taft, in a message to Congress on December 7, 1911, addressed the need for a \"central organization in touch with associations and chambers of commerce throughout the country and able to keep purely American interests in a closer touch with different phases of commercial affairs.\"\n Four months later, on April 12, 1912, President Taft's vision became a reality when a group of 700 delegates from various commercial and trade organizations came together to create a unified body of business interest that today is the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. )))))\n\n The Chamber has gone far beyond those original goals and is now the tool of plutocrats and oligarchs.

   ".... Having been reminded of these historical facts and knowing full well of our marxist presidents animosity toward this organization, let's now look at organizations he has no problem with at all. I'm sure we all remember the very successful march on Washington on 8/12 promoted by Glenn Beck where a solid 500,000 americans with no political group affiliations gathered from all parts of our country to promote the principle of restoring honor to America, well, the militant left felt it was necessary to respond to this very successful and peaceful event where no arrests were made or trash left behind so with the help of the whitehouse, America's most extreme organizations from the American Communist Party, the American Socialist Party, SEIU, ACORN and around 400 more militant groups gathered their members which resulted in trashing Washington DC's Mall and only producing a crowd of around 150,000 America hating militants who seek to destroy the country our founders envisioned rather than preserving it for future generations.\n\n President Obama had no animosity toward the U.S. Chamber of Commerce until after it had done a shark attack on him and removed part of his leg and one of his hands. Also, I'd very much like to see documented proof of a link between President Obama and the Communist Party. You won't be able to find any that are reliable sources. George W. Bush had a far cozier connection with Red Communist China.\n \nShockingly, our president has no problem with the American Communist Party or the American Socialist Party as he does with the American Chamber of Commerce since his administration backed and supported the 10/10 event. This is why common Democrats, Independents and normally uninvolved Republicans are so rabidly involved in opposing Democrats at every level of the State and Federal political spectrum for these midterm elections. Because we all realize our very republic is at stake. This President intends to dismantle our America and before he can complete the process he must bankrupt us first. That is why he is spending money we don't have, because only in crisis mode can he carry out his radical agenda which will result with an even larger nanny state with even more power resting in the hands of an elite ruling class which he intends to lead.\n\n Proof? Documentation? Do you know and understand what evidence is? Show me the links. Until then I must conclude that your excessive blah blah issues from one of your bodily orifices.\n \nNow let's make this the highest voter turnout of any midterm election this Country has ever seen and send a message that we will never abandon the Republic our founders envisioned and sacrificed so much for so we can enjoy the highest quality of life in the world which this president is seeking to destroy. Remember people, a vote for a democrat is a vote for Obama and a vote for indentured servitude as he turns WE THE PEOPLE of the middle class into surfs.\n\n High voter turnout. Yeah! Good for Democrats. And a vote for Republicans is a vote for indentured servitude to a company based on the Cayman Islands with hourly pay comparable to what is paid to peasants in Communist Red China.",

Even Palin's prophetic pop picks couldn't better a 50% success rate, and cost them the senate. The Right are now in the worst possible place for them, sharing the blame without the power to do anything to change things. Looking good for a second term.\n\n \n Let's look at the actual numbers, shall we? Starting with Governorships and State Legislators which really tells the SWEEPING grassroots story of this election.Republicans captured a majority of governorships and notched sweeping gains in state legislatures, giving the party the upper hand in redistricting battles that will redraw the electoral map for the next decade. The GOP took control of both chambers in 25 state legislatures, up from 14; Democrats, who had held held 27, saw their tally sink to 16.\n \n Read more: Insult to Injury - Swampland - TIME.com Republicans captured Democratic governorships in at least 11 states on Tuesday, including some prime presidential battlegrounds, and hoped for even more statehouse gains. \n \n The same tide sweeping Republicans into office in Congress was leaving its mark on governors' mansions as well, especially in the U.S. industrial heartland. \n \n Changing hands in the Republican wave were governorships now held by Democrats in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Maine, Tennessee, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Wyoming. Republicans Make Big Gains in Governors Races - CBS News\n \n Add to that the 63 Republican US Representatives elected and this represents a legitimate and undeniable sweep across every political spectrum in the country. Your side may want to deny that reality, but that changes nothing where reality is concerned.\n \n Also, those surviving moderate/blue dog senators have gotten the message from the american people loud and clear no matter what the leftist pundits say, and when they are pressured to do the RIGHT thing and support Republican bills that come over from the NEW House, they will be highly motivated to support the majority which is attempting to actually carry out the will of the american people rather than cram legislation down our throats they know we don't want, as the Democrats have done for the last two years. They will do this or know without doubt that the Tea Party is organized enough \"NOW\" to put up a truly representative candidate and defeat them in 012. \n \n The far left extreme socialist minority in the US refuses to acknowledge publicly the anger fomented in the american people when the Democrats completely ignored the national outcry of the american people as they made back room deals and threatened as well as coerced democrats from across the country to vote for legislation the majority of the people in their own districts made very clear they DID NOT WANT.\n \n Never have we seen so many politicians go into a recess and immediately go into hiding from their constituents as we saw from the democrats who supported Obamacare. Even though everything I'm saying is absolutely fact, I will no doubt get responses that deny these facts as you leftists attempt to either rewrite history or reinterpret it as you ignore what the american people have said with their votes during this midterm election cycle.\n \n The US Political map is looking very red lately: File:2010 House elections.svg - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

Besides, the hundred million your link suggests these brothers have contributed is peanuts compared to the agenda and investment Soros has made to finance his anti-american ideology. Here's what I mean:\n To gain some perspective on the massive levels of funding that George Soros lavishes on the far Left, be sure to view this vital document:\n Organizations Funded Directly by George Soros and his Open Society Institute\n \n \n George Soros is one of the most powerful men on earth. A New York hedge fund manager, he has amassed a personal fortune estimated at about $13 billion (as of 2009). His management company controls billions more in investor assets. Since 1979, Soros' foundation network -- whose flagship is the Open Society Institute (OSI) -- has dispensed more than $5 billion to a multitude of organizations whose objectives are consistent with those of Soros. (The President of OSI and the Soros Foundation Network is Aryeh Neier, former Director of the socialist League for Industrial Democracy.) With assets of $1.93 billion as of 2008, OSI alone donates scores of millions of dollars annually to these various groups, whose major agendas can be summarized as follows: \n \n promoting the view that America is institutionally an oppressive nation\n promoting the election of leftist political candidates throughout the United States\n opposing virtually all post-9/11 national security measures enacted by U.S. government, particularly the Patriot Act\n depicting American military actions as unjust, unwarranted, and immoral\n promoting open borders, mass immigration, and a watering down of current immigration laws\n promoting a dramatic expansion of social welfare programs funded by ever-escalating taxes\n promoting social welfare benefits and amnesty for illegal aliens\n defending suspected anti-American terrorists and their abetters\n financing the recruitment and training of future activist leaders of the political Left\n advocating America's unilateral disarmament and/or a steep reduction in its military spending\n opposing the death penalty in all circumstances\n promoting socialized medicine in the United States\n promoting the tenets of radical environmentalism, whose ultimate goal, as writer Michael Berliner has explained, is \"not clean air and clean water, [but] rather ... the demolition of technological/industrial civilization\"\n bringing American foreign policy under the control of the United Nations\n promoting racial and ethnic preferences in academia and the business world alike. \n To view a list of many of the more important organizations that support these agendas and have received direct funding from Soros and his Open Society Institute in recent years, click here. (Comprehensive profiles of each are available in the \"Groups\" category of DiscoverTheNetworks.org.) \n \n There are also numerous \"secondary\" or \"indirect\" affiliates of the Soros network. These include organizations which do not receive direct funding from Soros and OSI, but which are funded by one or more organizations that do. These secondary affiliates also include organizations that work collaboratively or synergistically with Soros-funded groups. To view a list of some of these organizations, click here: http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/viewSubCategory.asp?id=1238. (Comprehensive profiles of each are available in the \"Groups\" category of DiscoverTheNetworks.org.) \n http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/viewSubCategory.asp?id=589\n \n The question one must ask is, if everything Soros is doing is above board and morally supportable, why all of the shadow groups and hidden money trails? Of course I wouldn't expect you to ask those questions. emoticon_xdonno",

   "Let's look at the actual numbers, shall we? Starting with Governorships and State Legislators which really tells the SWEEPING grassroots story of this election.Republicans captured a majority of governorships and notched sweeping gains in state legislatures, giving the party the upper hand in redistricting battles that will redraw the electoral map for the next decade. The GOP took control of both chambers in 25 state legislatures, up from 14; Democrats, who had held held 27, saw their tally sink to 16.\n \n Read more: Insult to Injury - Swampland - TIME.com Republicans captured Democratic governorships in at least 11 states on Tuesday, including some prime presidential battlegrounds, and hoped for even more statehouse gains. \n \n The same tide sweeping Republicans into office in Congress was leaving its mark on governors' mansions as well, especially in the U.S. industrial heartland. \n \n Changing hands in the Republican wave were governorships now held by Democrats in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Maine, Tennessee, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Wyoming. Republicans Make Big Gains in Governors Races - CBS News\n \n Add to that the 63 Republican US Representatives elected and this represents a legitimate and undeniable sweep across every political spectrum in the country. Your side may want to deny that reality, but that changes nothing where reality is concerned.\n \n Also, those surviving moderate/blue dog senators have gotten the message from the american people loud and clear no matter what the leftist pundits say, and when they are pressured to do the RIGHT thing and support Republican bills that come over from the NEW House, they will be highly motivated to support the majority which is attempting to actually carry out the will of the american people rather than cram legislation down our throats they know we don't want, as the Democrats have done for the last two years. They will do this or know without doubt that the Tea Party is organized enough \"NOW\" to put up a truly representative candidate and defeat them in 012. \n \n The far left extreme socialist minority in the US refuses to acknowledge publicly the anger fomented in the american people when the Democrats completely ignored the national outcry of the american people as they made back room deals and threatened as well as coerced democrats from across the country to vote for legislation the majority of the people in their own districts made very clear they DID NOT WANT.\n \n Never have we seen so many politicians go into a recess and immediately go into hiding from their constituents as we saw from the democrats who supported Obamacare. Even though everything I'm saying is absolutely fact, I will no doubt get responses that deny these facts as you leftists attempt to either rewrite history or reinterpret it as you ignore what the american people have said with their votes during this midterm election cycle.\n \n The US Political map is looking very red lately: File:2010 House elections.svg - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n \n Thank you for contributing to the problem. It is obvious that our government is overflowing with incompetent, inept and unqualified people. They can be found in both parties.

Your solution is not to work a compromise that gets the country moving forward, but to encourage the election of people who are even less qualified than the one they are replacing or believe the best course of action is to continue to be an obstacle to any policy that may help Democrats in the election 2 years away. What is the agenda going to be? To make sure Republicans gain as much control as they can by killing anything that comes from Democrats.\n \n There you go that should get things moving real quick.

   "Heaven forbid that anyone should finance the RIGHT as George Soros does the LEFT. Besides, the hundred million your link suggests these brothers have contributed is peanuts compared to the agenda and investment Soros has made to finance his anti-american ideology. Here's what I mean:\n To gain some perspective on the massive levels of funding that George Soros lavishes on the far Left, be sure to view this vital document:\n Organizations Funded Directly by George Soros and his Open Society Institute\n \n \n George Soros is one of the most powerful men on earth. A New York hedge fund manager, he has amassed a personal fortune estimated at about $13 billion (as of 2009). His management company controls billions more in investor assets. Since 1979, Soros' foundation network -- whose flagship is the Open Society Institute (OSI) -- has dispensed more than $5 billion to a multitude of organizations whose objectives are consistent with those of Soros. (The President of OSI and the Soros Foundation Network is Aryeh Neier, former Director of the socialist League for Industrial Democracy.) With assets of $1.93 billion as of 2008, OSI alone donates scores of millions of dollars annually to these various groups, whose major agendas can be summarized as follows: \n \n promoting the view that America is institutionally an oppressive nation\n promoting the election of leftist political candidates throughout the United States\n opposing virtually all post-9/11 national security measures enacted by U.S. government, particularly the Patriot Act\n depicting American military actions as unjust, unwarranted, and immoral\n promoting open borders, mass immigration, and a watering down of current immigration laws\n promoting a dramatic expansion of social welfare programs funded by ever-escalating taxes\n promoting social welfare benefits and amnesty for illegal aliens\n defending suspected anti-American terrorists and their abetters\n financing the recruitment and training of future activist leaders of the political Left\n advocating America's unilateral disarmament and/or a steep reduction in its military spending\n opposing the death penalty in all circumstances\n promoting socialized medicine in the United States\n promoting the tenets of radical environmentalism, whose ultimate goal, as writer Michael Berliner has explained, is \"not clean air and clean water, [but] rather ... the demolition of technological/industrial civilization\"\n bringing American foreign policy under the control of the United Nations\n promoting racial and ethnic preferences in academia and the business world alike. \n To view a list of many of the more important organizations that support these agendas and have received direct funding from Soros and his Open Society Institute in recent years, click here. (Comprehensive profiles of each are available in the \"Groups\" category of DiscoverTheNetworks.org.) \n \n There are also numerous \"secondary\" or \"indirect\" affiliates of the Soros network. These include organizations which do not receive direct funding from Soros and OSI, but which are funded by one or more organizations that do. These secondary affiliates also include organizations that work collaboratively or synergistically with Soros-funded groups. To view a list of some of these organizations, click here: http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/viewSubCategory.asp?id=1238. (Comprehensive profiles of each are available in the \"Groups\" category of DiscoverTheNetworks.org.) \n http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/viewSubCategory.asp?id=589\n \n The question one must ask is, if everything Soros is doing is above board and morally supportable, why all of the shadow groups and hidden money trails? Of course I wouldn't expect you to ask those questions. emoticon_xdonno\n\n \n He did just of groups that are doing either the exact opposite, but just as extreme or reprehensible that you happen to like. How about Soros and the Koch brothers and all people like them get out of the buying politics game. Put caps on campaign finance, put restrictions on pacs and corporate lobbyists and a whole lot of this nonsense goes away.\n \n I will vote to get my side in check will you do the same?",

It is very troubling to read your posts full, which are well written, but with such arrogance and then to discover that it's all smoke and mirrors to promote an agenda. Since you seem to always want proof below is an example from your article on Soros\n \n What your article said he said\n \n By the time Obama was elected, it was clear that his economic and political prescriptions for America were quite consistent with those of Soros. For example, in a November 2008 interview with Spiegel, Soros made some comments which foreshadowed precisely the course that President Obama's administration would eventually pursue in 2009. Said Soros:\n \n \"I think we need a large stimulus package which will provide funds for state and local government to maintain their budgets ... For such a program to be successful, the federal government would need to provide hundreds of billions of dollars. In addition, another infrastructure program is necessary. In total, the cost would be in the 300 to 600 billion dollar range.... I think this is a great opportunity to finally deal with global warming and energy dependence. The U.S. needs a cap and trade system with auctioning of licenses for emissions rights. I would use the revenues from these auctions to launch a new, environmentally friendly energy policy.\"\n \n The interviewer then said: \"Your proposal would be dismissed on Wall Street as 'big government.' Republicans might call it European-style 'socialism.'\" Soros replied:\n \n \"That is exactly what we need now. I am against market fundamentalism. I think this propaganda that government involvement is always bad has been very successful -- but also very harmful to our society.... I think it is better to have a government that wants to provide good government than a government that doesn't believe in government.... At times of recession, running a budget deficit is highly desirable.\"\n \n What was actually said\n \n SPIEGEL: Currently, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is in charge of the bail-out. What are your misgivings about his performance?\n \n Soros: He reacted to problems as they arose; he had no capacity to anticipate them. When he allowed Lehman Brothers to fail, the breakdown of the financial markets found him totally unprepared. He went to Congress not with a plan but with a plan to develop a plan. And the plan he had in mind -- to purchase toxic assets -- was ill-conceived. Injecting equity capital into the banking system made much more sense and he eventually came to see that, but again he went about it in the wrong way. Then he stopped doing anything, leaving a vacuum in leadership, and the markets collapsed.\n \n SPIEGEL: What are your expectations for the next Secretary of the Treasury?\n \n Soros: I think we need a large stimulus package which will provide funds for state and local government to maintain their budgets -- because they are not allowed by the constitution to run a deficit. For such a program to be successful, the federal government would need to provide hundreds of billions of dollars. In addition, another infrastructure program is necessary. In total, the cost would be in the 300 to 600 billion dollar range.\n \n SPIEGEL: In addition to the $700 billion bailout for the financial industry?\n \n Soros: Definitely. I think this is a great opportunity to finally deal with global warming and energy dependence. The US needs a cap and trade system with auctioning of licenses for emissions rights. I would use the revenues from these auctions to launch a new, environmentally friendly energy policy. That would be yet another federal program that could help us to overcome the current stagnation.\n \n SPIEGEL: Your proposal would be dismissed on Wall Street as \"big government.\" Republicans might call it European-style \"socialism.\"\n \n Soros: That is exactly what we need now. I am against market fundamentalism. I think this propaganda that government involvement is always bad has been very successful -- but also very harmful to our society.\n \n SPIEGEL: Would you advise the new president to say that publicly?\n \n Soros: He has already spoken about changing the political discourse. I think it is better to have a government that wants to provide good government than a government that doesn't believe in government. \n \n SPIEGEL: Would you advise the new president to say that publicly?\n \n Soros: He has already spoken about changing the political discourse. I think it is better to have a government that wants to provide good government than a government that doesn't believe in government.\n \n SPIEGEL: However, even a strong government can't perform miracles. It needs money from the taxpayers. There is a lot of talk in the US about the new role of the state and the government -- but no one seems to be willing to pay for it. Obama has announced to cut taxes for 95 percent of working Americans. Isn't that a contradiction?\n \n Soros: At times of recession, running a budget deficit is highly desirable. Once the economy begins to recover, you have to balance the budget. In 2010, the Bush tax cuts will expire and we should not extend them. But we will also need additional revenues. Should the government not receive them, we will all get punished with higher interest rates.\n \n \n Sad very sad",

And why do you call the new people elected unqualified if they in fact carry out the will of the people who elected them?\n \n \n Do you think they are going to have a poll before any vote to see what their people want? No they are going to vote their \"concience\" same as the ones before them. They have no more interest in reaching comprimise than D or R. When you have a nation this size the phrase you can't please all of the people all of the time amounts to a whole lot of people. All sides have deteriated to party politics, its like watching street gangs in suits.

You should be endorsing and supporting that if you are serious about getting fiscally responsible in Washington DC.\n \n \n How many Democrats just got fired? That is not the problem we have always been able to fire by vote. The fault at the end of the day is ours. We are to busy to pay attention to what the people we elect to look out for us are doing. We forgive the wrong ones and ignore the good ones. I got two words to prove we need to look at who we vote in before we complain. \n \n Marion Barry.\n \n \nNow you're changing the subject. This guy penfold attacked the Koch Brothers for spending a hundred million dollars supporting legitimate constitutional issues while not being the least disturbed that Soros has spent five billion dollars on militant anti american activism. The hypocrisy and denial of the facts is obvious yet the penfolds out there are completely blind to it, and apparently you are also since you ignored what was the meat of my point.\n\n \n And so now you reciprocate. My point was whether either one is backing \"legitimate\" issues, they posses a disproportionate influence on politics than almost all of the population. Its in a broad sense a caste system. Don't misunderstand I was for many years very Republican minded when it came to business and still hold most of those beliefs, but business has shown that it isn't ready to regulate itself without government. One of the ways the few ruin it for the rest is what Soros and the Koch's are doing. \n \n So are you in favor of corporations and wealthy individuals having near to or unrestricted influence in US politics? Is the kind of resources these 3 people have put into guiding government in the direction they want something the founding fathers would be ok with and are you ok with it?\n \n Am I blind or is it you who needs to take a little harder look at what you seem to know is right. You seem to have already made up your mind and discount anything contrary while embracing without question the views aligned with your conclusions. Even before I found the statistics below I noticed your comparison of Soros and Koch is not apples to apples. \n \n Organization-Driven Political Activity\n \n The Koch brothers' company, Koch Industries, has been a big player in both campaign donations and lobbying. Koch Industries currently leads the oil and gas industry as the top contributor to federal candidates and parties, and is the fifth highest lobbying spender in the industry this year. Soros' hedge fund, Soros Fund Management, has also lobbied at the federal level, but employees have not made campaign donations through a Soros-sponsored political action committee. Because of the notable lobbying involvement of a Soros-funded think tank, the Open Society Policy Center, this group's data is also included for the purpose of this comparison:\n \n \n Political Action Committee Spending (1989 to 2010)\n Koch Industries: $5,938,993 (83 percent going to Republicans)\n \n Soros Fund Management: $0\n \n \n 527 Group Contributions (2001 to 2010)\n Koch Industries: $574,998\n \n * $186,598 - Democratic Governors Association\n * $150,000 - Republican State Leadership Committee\n * $103,400 - Republican Governors Association\n \n Soros Fund Management: $0\n \n \n Lobbying Expenditures (1998 to 2010)\n Koch Industries: $50,972,700\n \n Soros Fund Management: $860,000\n Open Society Policy Center (Soros-Funded): $11,930,000\n \n According to federal lobbying reports, Koch Industries' top issues include energy, environmental, tax and homeland security policies. The Open Society Policy Center has mainly lobbied on issues relating to foreign relations, civil rights, and law enforcement policy. The graph below outlines these organizations lobbying history since 1998 (click on graph for full size):\n \n Koch vs Soros Lobbying Expenditures.bmp\n VERDICT: When it comes to to the combination of institutional lobbying, 527 group donations and PAC expenditures, Koch Industries far out-spends Soros' hedge fund and think tank, $57.4 million to $12.8 million. Most of this money is attributable to lobbying expenditures.\n \n \n Individual-Funded Political Activity\n \n \n Soros and the Koch brothers have all donated to federal political campaigns and committees. While Soros has far out-spent the Koch brothers in donating to 527 groups, especially when considering his incredible $23.7 million in donations to the groups between 2003 and 2004, the Koch brothers have donated more money to federal candidates and committees.\n \n The Koch brothers give almost exclusively to Republicans just as Soros donates predominately to Democrats and Democratic organizations. Overall, Soros has spent $34.24 million and the Kochs have spent $4.06 million.

   "Do you think they are going to have a poll before any vote to see what their people want? No they are going to vote their \"concience\" same as the ones before them. They have no more interest in reaching comprimise than D or R. When you have a nation this size the phrase you can't please all of the people all of the time amounts to a whole lot of people. All sides have deteriated to party politics, its like watching street gangs in suits. So the will of the people has become the will of the side that won.\n \n How many Democrats just got fired? That is not the problem we have always been able to fire by vote. The fault at the end of the day is ours. We are to busy to pay attention to what the people we elect to look out for us are doing. We forgive the wrong ones and ignore the good ones. I got two words to prove we need to look at who we vote in before we complain. \n \n Marion Barry.\n \n \n \n And so now you reciprocate. My point was whether either one is backing \"legitimate\" issues, they posses a disproportionate influence on politics than almost all of the population. Its in a broad sense a caste system. Don't misunderstand I was for many years very Republican minded when it came to business and still hold most of those beliefs, but business has shown that it isn't ready to regulate itself without government. One of the ways the few ruin it for the rest is what Soros and the Koch's are doing. \n \n So are you in favor of corporations and wealthy individuals having near to or unrestricted influence in US politics? Is the kind of resources these 3 people have put into guiding government in the direction they want something the founding fathers would be ok with and are you ok with it?\n \n Am I blind or is it you who needs to take a little harder look at what you seem to know is right. You seem to have already made up your mind and discount anything contrary while embracing without question the views aligned with your conclusions. Even before I found the statistics below I noticed your comparison of Soros and Koch is not apples to apples. \n \n Organization-Driven Political Activity\n \n The Koch brothers' company, Koch Industries, has been a big player in both campaign donations and lobbying. Koch Industries currently leads the oil and gas industry as the top contributor to federal candidates and parties, and is the fifth highest lobbying spender in the industry this year. Soros' hedge fund, Soros Fund Management, has also lobbied at the federal level, but employees have not made campaign donations through a Soros-sponsored political action committee. Because of the notable lobbying involvement of a Soros-funded think tank, the Open Society Policy Center, this group's data is also included for the purpose of this comparison:\n \n \n Political Action Committee Spending (1989 to 2010)\n Koch Industries: $5,938,993 (83 percent going to Republicans)\n \n Soros Fund Management: $0\n \n \n 527 Group Contributions (2001 to 2010)\n Koch Industries: $574,998\n \n * $186,598 - Democratic Governors Association\n * $150,000 - Republican State Leadership Committee\n * $103,400 - Republican Governors Association\n \n Soros Fund Management: $0\n \n \n Lobbying Expenditures (1998 to 2010)\n Koch Industries: $50,972,700\n \n Soros Fund Management: $860,000\n Open Society Policy Center (Soros-Funded): $11,930,000\n \n According to federal lobbying reports, Koch Industries' top issues include energy, environmental, tax and homeland security policies. The Open Society Policy Center has mainly lobbied on issues relating to foreign relations, civil rights, and law enforcement policy. The graph below outlines these organizations lobbying history since 1998 (click on graph for full size):\n \n Koch vs Soros Lobbying Expenditures.bmp\n VERDICT: When it comes to to the combination of institutional lobbying, 527 group donations and PAC expenditures, Koch Industries far out-spends Soros' hedge fund and think tank, $57.4 million to $12.8 million. Most of this money is attributable to lobbying expenditures.\n \n \n Individual-Funded Political Activity\n \n \n Soros and the Koch brothers have all donated to federal political campaigns and committees. While Soros has far out-spent the Koch brothers in donating to 527 groups, especially when considering his incredible $23.7 million in donations to the groups between 2003 and 2004, the Koch brothers have donated more money to federal candidates and committees.\n \n The Koch brothers give almost exclusively to Republicans just as Soros donates predominately to Democrats and Democratic organizations. Overall, Soros has spent $34.24 million and the Kochs have spent $4.06 million. (Note: This study only covers donations to federal candidates - to see donations to state candidates, go to Followthemoney.org and search for Soros and Koch. For example, as Ben Smith of Politico wrote recently, David Koch and his wife have given $74,000 to a Democrat, Andrew Cuomo, New York's State Attorney General.)\n Individual donations to federal candidates, parties and political action committees (1989 to 2010)\n Koch Brothers: $2.58 million\n George Soros: $1.74 million\n \n David Koch: $2,224,170\n \n * $667,500 - National Republican Congressional Committee\n * $555,000 - Republican National Committee\n * $191,400 - National Republican Senatorial Committee\n \n \n Charles G.

In 2003, PBS estimated Soros had donated more than $4 billion since the 1980s.\n \n There is more all said and done before charities I believe they are about even or at significantly closer than what you imply.\n \n Capital Rivals: Koch Brothers vs. George Soros - OpenSecrets Blog | OpenSecrets\n\n \n You failed to cut and paste far enough down the page. You forgot to post this info on Soros contributions to 527s, the very groups you complained about above. See?\n ndividual donations to 527 organizations (2001 to 2010)\n George Soros: $32.5 million\n Koch Brothers: $1.5 million\n \n So-called 527 groups are non-profit, tax-exempt organizations that are allowed to raise money for political activities including voter mobilization efforts, issue advocacy and other actions. They are allowed to raise unlimited amounts of money from individuals, corporations and unions. Until earlier this year, they could not use these unlimited contributions to expressly advocate for the election or defeat of a federal candidate. Federal court rulings -- including Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission and SpeechNow.org v. Federal Election Commission -- have broken down that restriction. For more information go here, here and here.\n \n As mentioned previously, Soros spent $24 million in under two years and did so in his determination to defeat George W. Bush in 2004. He told the Washington Post in November 2003, \"America under Bush, is a danger to the world. I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is.\" Since December 2008, Soros has only donated $4,000 to these types of groups. On June 30th of this year, David Koch made a $1 million donation to the Republican Governors Association, his largest one-time donation to date.\n \n David Koch: $1,472,000\n \n $1,352,000 - Republican Governors Association\n $100,000 - Americans for Better Government\n \n George Soros: $32,506,500\n $12.05 million - Joint Victory Campaign 2004\n $7.5 million - America Coming Together\n $2.5 million - MoveOn.org\n $3.65 million - America Votes\n $3.5 million - The Fund for America\n $150,000 - Win Back Respect\n $120,000 - Majority Action\n $100,000 - Campaign Money Watch\n \n Soros certainly wins the 527 group spending battle, beating the Koch brothers $32.5 million to $1.5 million. A graph below show the history these donations (click on graph for full size):\n Beside the fact that this 32.5 million dollars was spent on political attack ads which attempted to assassinate the character of good people, don't forget that since Soros has been politically active since 1979, he has spent around 5 BILLION DOLLARS to the 100 MILLION the Koch Brothers have spent since the late 90s when they became politically active. \n \n Also, by your own posting you admit that the Koch Brothers donated to both Democrats and Republicans between 2001 and 2010. Here's what you posted above:\n 527 Group Contributions (2001 to 2010)\n Koch Industries: $574,998\n \n * $186,598 - Democratic Governors Association\n * $150,000 - Republican State Leadership Committee\n * $103,400 - Republican Governors Association\n I challenge you to show me where and when Soros ever donated one thin dime to anything Republican. Go on, show me that.",

   "So The New Yorker article was right. No one here has been able to find fault with it.\n \n It is obvious that the Kochs, the Murdochs of this world manipulate the mob to suit their interests. What I find amazing is that although the interest of the rich is contrary to the interest of the mob, the mob is so unintelligent, so blinded by its own emotions (hate mainly) that it is easily manipulated to act against its own interest.\n \n When one listens the tea party people talk, including the speech givers one realises that there has to be some intelligent powerful people behind the curtains moving, planning, organising the whole circus, since these persons are obviosly dumb and ignorant; therefore to find out that the Kochs are behind this comes as no surprise.\n\n \n The only dumb and ignorant person around here is the guy who wrote this post calling Tea Party members dumb and ignorant. You either have no idea what the facts about the Tea Party are or you really are too dumb and ignorant to comprehend the truth of what has transpired in this country during this election cycle.

The anger from the process we just witnessed is what created the Tea Party to form in the first place.

Like I said earlier, the Tea Party is nothing more than a state by state and nationally organized voting block. The power this unified front gives us is something we have never had before in my lifetime. So your pessimism is very premature as you assume that nothing good or positive will come from this election cycle, and in two years we can refine what has been accomplished further until we get a true and complete representative government. 2 republicans on the Tea Parties radar right now is Lindsey Graham and Trent Lott.

Here's a quote from the site:\n [Quote From Site]AFV LAUNCHES AD IN POLITICO CALLING ON CONGRESS TO TAX CREDIT UNIONS LIKE REGULAR BANKS- AND PASS THE DURBIN SWIPE FEE AMENDMENT\n \n If it walks like a bank, talks like a bank, and quacks like a bank... it should be TAXED like a bank.\n \n In 1934, Congress gave not-for-profit credit unions tax-exempt status due to their unique role as lenders of last resort for the poor and underserved.\n \n But today, credit unions comprise a $680 billion industry. This is not your grandfather's credit union.\n \n So why are these not-for-profit credit unions crying wolf about common sense interchange swipe fee reform?\n \n Credit unions are carrying the water for credit card giants VISA and MasterCard&#8212; and the big Wall Street banks that helped cause the financial crisis.\n See how they utilize the same class and corporate warfare tactics in order to demonize business and bleed them dry.\n \n Rangel: Triumphant Campaign. What Next? | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington\n [Quote From Site]Charles B. Rangel did it again. Even though nobody expected otherwise, Rangel was elected to his 21st term in Congress on Tuesday, winning about 80 percent of the vote. &#8220;We did it again,&#8221; Rangel was quoted as saying by DNAinfo.com. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t seen nothing yet.&#8221;\n Winning the election was easy, compared to what the congressman has coming next. Rangel is facing 13 charges of ethics violations, including failure to report income from various sources, misuse of congressional free mail privileges and use of an upper Manhattan subsidized apartment for a campaign office instead of a residence.\n &#8220;Even though they are serious charges, I&#8217;m prepared to prove that the only thing I&#8217;ve had in my 50 years of public service is service,&#8221; Rangel told reporters in July, when the charges were announced by the House ethics committee.\n This is actually laughable how utterly hypocritical these leftist groups are. This group is called Citizens for Ethics in Government yet they are not the least bit critical of Charles Rangel as the link makes clear. They exist only to attack conservatives. Do you think that if a Republican was facing charges like these they would have a positive puff piece like this on this site? I have made my point for you.

Both are Rinos, neither of which can be trusted. So dont be so negative and embrace the principles upon which the Tea Party exists and you too will be empowered by the voting block it represents. That is if you really desire a fiscally responsible and representative Government as you claim to want.\n\n \n Can you offer up some specific plans the the TP as a whole plans on implementing? I don't mean generic repeal health care and replace it with reforms or cut federal spending, reduce the deficit, cut taxes and balance the budget. Those are broad generalization that sound great, but what exactly are they going to do to accomplish these things?\n \n The only benefit I see from the Tea Party is that given the right motivation a third or maybe even a fourth party is viable. I think part of the problem with government is we are repeatedly forced to choose from a limited pool of candidates. It is unreasonable to think that a two party system will reflect the the wants and needs of a population this size.",

I think part of the problem with government is we are repeatedly forced to choose from a limited pool of candidates. It is unreasonable to think that a two party system will reflect the the wants and needs of a population this size.\n\n \n Is it beyond you to comprehend that the Tea Party isn't a political party at all, but is a unified voting block of individual americans who seek only to elect politicians who will represent us honestly and will sincerely carry out the will of the people? And we don't care what party the politician belongs to as long as he/she sincerely follows these principles as an independent representative of his/her constituents. The bolded issues you raised above describes perfectly what we want in a truly representative gov't. And since I'm not a professional politician, I see no reason to direct how my representatives will carry out my wishes, as long as they do it.\n \n That is the beauty of the Tea Party, it exists as a unified voting block that demands loyalty from our elected officials, not to carry out my specific individual agenda, or their own agenda to gain personal power, but to follow what the constitution laid out for a truly representative government and to do what is best for the country as a whole. If our politicians do that, then there will be no reason to ever vote them out of office no matter what their political party. \n \n We don't need to be micro-managed and told what we can eat and drink like some socialist nanny state which this administration is attempting to impose on us right now. We need the Government to back off and allow us to run our own affairs as the free nation we were designed to be in the constitution. As a liberal, you should completely agree with what I am saying, except that todays socialists/liberals who have hijacked the democratic party believe in freedoms as long as it's the freedoms you agree with. Why a smaller, less intrusive government threatens you people is beyond me to comprehend.\n \n Todays american liberal always argues that you are the party of tolerance, free speech and opportunity yet you are blind to the constant and never ending legislation your side is promoting in order to micro-manage and control every aspect of our lives. You hate tax cuts but you love tax credits that reward the lemmings that buy into your socialist programs which increase the Washington bureaucracy and further entrenches democrats power and raises budgets which raises taxes to support the bureaucracies in a never ending cycle of larger and larger government.\n \n The liberals idea of cutting spending is to not increase a bureaucracies budget by the expected 5%, but only raise it by 2%. To a leftist that is a 3% budget cut. But it isn't a cut at all. It is simply not raising the budget according to the annual allowance. \n \n So get off of this idea that the Tea Party is going to be, or wants to be some actual third party. We are happy to support and elect whichever candidates from either of the existing party's that represent the ideals of a constitutional and representative government.",

   "You failed to cut and paste far enough down the page. You forgot to post this info on Soros contributions to 527s, the very groups you complained about above. See?\n\n \n \n No I didn't forget. I felt the additional page worth of redundant information would be overkill on what was an already lengthy post.\n \n \n \nndividual donations to 527 organizations (2001 to 2010)\n George Soros: $32.5 million\n Koch Brothers: $1.5 million\n \n So-called 527 groups are non-profit, tax-exempt organizations that are allowed to raise money for political activities including voter mobilization efforts, issue advocacy and other actions. They are allowed to raise unlimited amounts of money from individuals, corporations and unions. Until earlier this year, they could not use these unlimited contributions to expressly advocate for the election or defeat of a federal candidate. Federal court rulings -- including Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission and SpeechNow.org v. Federal Election Commission -- have broken down that restriction. For more information go here, here and here.\n \n As mentioned previously, Soros spent $24 million in under two years and did so in his determination to defeat George W. Bush in 2004. He told the Washington Post in November 2003, \"America under Bush, is a danger to the world. I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is.\" Since December 2008, Soros has only donated $4,000 to these types of groups. On June 30th of this year, David Koch made a $1 million donation to the Republican Governors Association, his largest one-time donation to date.\n \n David Koch: $1,472,000\n \n $1,352,000 - Republican Governors Association\n $100,000 - Americans for Better Government\n \n George Soros: $32,506,500\n $12.05 million - Joint Victory Campaign 2004\n $7.5 million - America Coming Together\n $2.5 million - MoveOn.org\n $3.65 million - America Votes\n $3.5 million - The Fund for America\n $150,000 - Win Back Respect\n $120,000 - Majority Action\n $100,000 - Campaign Money Watch\n \n Soros certainly wins the 527 group spending battle, beating the Koch brothers $32.5 million to $1.5 million. A graph below show the history these donations (click on graph for full size):\n Beside the fact that this 32.5 million dollars was spent on political attack ads which attempted to assassinate the character of good people, don't forget that since Soros has been politically active since 1979, he has spent around 5 BILLION DOLLARS to the 100 MILLION the Koch Brothers have spent since the late 90s when they became politically active. \n\n \n A very large number of people do not consider George Bush \"good people\", I wonder what this country would look like had Bush lost re-election, something we will never know, but few think his second term was a good one.\n \n Odd your source doesn't say how it arrived at 5 billion. The only thing I could find close to that is his 4 billion in donations to charities. That would leave about a billion dollars from 1979 until 2003 when PBS made the statement regarding the donations. Not bad for a guy who was reportedly worth 13 billion in 2009. Find me someone else who has given 1/3 of the wealth to charities. That's roughly 41 million a year for politics. \n \n But this site states Soros has only given 3.4 million since 1979.\n \n George Soros Biography - Money,Politics, George Soros Biography, Campaign Contributions\n \n So either your site or mine isn't getting it right. \n \n The point I was making other than to show you keep buying into the hype, which again you did, was that people like Soros and the Koch brothers have to much influence in politics due to their wealth. They can earn as much as they can, welcome to America, but there should be restriction on the money being spent politically.\n \n \n \nAlso, by your own posting you admit that the Koch Brothers donated to both Democrats and Republicans between 2001 and 2010. Here's what you posted above:\n 527 Group Contributions (2001 to 2010)\n Koch Industries: $574,998\n \n * $186,598 - Democratic Governors Association\n * $150,000 - Republican State Leadership Committee\n * $103,400 - Republican Governors Association\n I challenge you to show me where and when Soros ever donated one thin dime to anything Republican. Go on, show me that.\n\n \n \n Why? Are you now suggesting that people must contribute to political ideas that they do not agree with?",

   "The truth of my evidence that you saw as propaganda isn't propaganda at all but is an accurate quote of an interview Soros gave in 08. You are so misled that you used it as evidence of something good for you when it simply proved my point that Yobama was and is in Soros pocket as a bought and paid for puppet.\n\n \n No actually it omitted key sentences and finished with a sentence from another paragraph. This had the effect of making an implication that wasn't part of the interview, but fit what the writer wanted you to believe. Which you did and apparently still do. So I guess back to my question is it ok to omit parts of an interview which by doing so change the tone or cause a meaning to be implied that was not there, passing it off as if nothing had been altered?\n \n \nAnd every one of those groups you defended are pro-socialist left wing militant arms of the democratic party which has hijacked the Democratic party which is why this mid term election was such a massive blow out in favor of anyone but democrats.\n \n \n So you are saying no you can't provide credible evidence that any of these organizations are pro socialist, militant democrats or anti American or any of the other flip remarks you have made. \n \n \n \nDo you really believe that this victory occurred without registered democrats voting against their party? You see, not all democrats agree with Yobama's socialist agenda or the parties heavy handed tactics over the last 2 years.\n \n\n \n Doesn't matter what I believe, it has nothing to do with what we are talking about. \n \n \nThese are the realities you refuse to accept due to your denial of reality and ignorance of the facts even though the cause of the recent revolt happened so close to us in time.\n\n \n So far you have been blah blah blah your opinion blah blah blah misrepresented evidence blah blah. \n \n Ignorance is worse when you insist its the other person. If you could get past your bias for just a minute and look objectively you might see things differently.\n \n \nAs for your special interest groups being dedicated Progressive arms of the democratic party, here are examples from the first 3 sites on your list: This links \"about us\" description speaks for itself as it admits it's a progressive organization.\n \n About | America Votes\n [Quote From Site] America Votes works across the country with over 300 state and national partner organizations to advance progressive policies\n http://www.google.com/url?url=http://www.americanfamilyvoices.org/&rct=j&sa=U&ei=h_PWTNLYFoOglAenhtX9CA&ved=0CBIQFjAA&sig2=Os6uu_ZLkYDQ1EcY1wnE7w&q=American+Family+Voices&usg=AFQjCNHcxrCiOQQUvY7hBRvB-6CKdML7kQ\n\n \n Sunshine, I asked you to prove they were anti American and pushing a socialist agenda. You equate that with being Progressive? Can you try harder or do better?\n \n \n \nThe top story on AFV is supporting the Durbin Swipe Fee Amendment which calls for taxing credit unions. Here's a quote from the site:\n [Quote From Site]AFV LAUNCHES AD IN POLITICO CALLING ON CONGRESS TO TAX CREDIT UNIONS LIKE REGULAR BANKS- AND PASS THE DURBIN SWIPE FEE AMENDMENT\n \n If it walks like a bank, talks like a bank, and quacks like a bank... it should be TAXED like a bank.\n \n In 1934, Congress gave not-for-profit credit unions tax-exempt status due to their unique role as lenders of last resort for the poor and underserved.\n \n But today, credit unions comprise a $680 billion industry. This is not your grandfather's credit union.\n \n So why are these not-for-profit credit unions crying wolf about common sense interchange swipe fee reform?\n \n Credit unions are carrying the water for credit card giants VISA and MasterCard- and the big Wall Street banks that helped cause the financial crisis.\n \n See how they utilize the same class and corporate warfare tactics in order to demonize business and bleed them dry.\n\n \n \n I see you obviously know nothing about what you are talking about here. The taxing issue is because when Congress gave them tax exempt status it was to make it fair since they had restrictions banks didn't have. Many of those restriction have been lifted ans while they still serve their original purpose they do not do so anywhere to the same extent. \n \n The swipe bill is to regulate the two companies that own the market and are driving small business into financial difficulties by either eating the increased fees or passing them off to the consumer. This is a protection for small business and consumers against Visa and MasterCard. Can you try to at least pretend you read about some of this stuff from someplace other than Propaganda monthly the Republican version of what is happening.\n \n \nRangel: Triumphant Campaign. What Next? | Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington\n [Quote From Site]Charles B. Rangel did it again. Even though nobody expected otherwise, Rangel was elected to his 21st term in Congress on Tuesday, winning about 80 percent of the vote. \"We did it again,\" Rangel was quoted as saying by DNAinfo.com. \"You ain't seen nothing yet.\"\n Winning the election was easy, compared to what the congressman has coming next. Rangel is facing 13 charges of ethics violations, including failure to report income from various sources, misuse of congressional free mail privileges and use of an upper Manhattan subsidized apartment for a campaign office instead of a residence.\n \"Even though they are serious charges, I'm prepared to prove that the only thing I've had in my 50 years of public service is service,\" Rangel told reporters in July, when the charges were announced by the House ethics committee.\n This is actually laughable how utterly hypocritical these leftist groups are. This group is called Citizens for Ethics in Government yet they are not the least bit critical of Charles Rangel as the link makes clear. They exist only to attack conservatives. Do you think that if a Republican was facing charges like these they would have a positive puff piece like this on this site? I have made my point for you. All you need do is highlight the sites you posted with excuses and right click to google them and they will come up on the top of the page. I'm through proving what should be obvious to a 6 year old.\n\n \n Brilliant. Did you notice A there is an article discussing his ethics legal problems, B all the posts are links to articles written elsewhere covering both Dem and Rep. \n \n No wonder you find what you do it is what your looking for and that is what you see whether it is there or not. Your good at having a lot of unwarranted arrogance though, I will give you that",

I won't make the jump as many did regarding Sharon Angle's claim that God has a plan for all of us as meaning God wanted women to be raped and victims of incest, I doubt very much that was her intent, but it does show a lack of thought concerning difficult issues that can not be avoided. \n \n \n \"In New York, Carl Paladino, the tea party-backed Republican candidate for governor, caused a furor among Democrats when he said over the weekend that children shouldn't be \"brainwashed\" into thinking homosexuality is acceptable.\n \n In Colorado, GOP Senate nominee Ken Buck has tried to deflect questions about his stance against abortion rights. In Delaware, Senate candidate Christine O'Donnell has come under fire over the conservative religious views she espoused as a TV commentator, including preaching against the evils of masturbation.\n \n And in Nevada, Senate candidate Sharron Angle, a Southern Baptist, has called herself a faith-based politician.

They never explain how their small government view is compatible with their \"everybody has to play by the rules of my religion\" view. But there it is.\n \n \n...because the Tea Party has only promoted fiscal responsibility rather than social issues...\n\n \n Oh, I see. So because they \"only promoted fiscal responsibility rather than social issues,\" we should assume that those social issues don't matter even though they're held.\n \n Personally, I think the Tea Party's eminently reasonable call for fiscal responsibility -- not to be confused with their unreasonable call for sacrifice only on the spending side, but I digress -- is just a smokescreen for a far-right agenda. And that includes a far-right religious agenda. The Tea Party's fiscal agenda is this year's \"compassionate conservatism,\" designed to make the agenda seem like something it isn't.\n \n I should also add that, in my original post, I described the Republican party as the group that's been co-opted. And finding religious conservatives willing to put the force of law behind everything from abortion and gay rights to creationism and \"this is a Christian nation\" is like shooting fish in a barrel.\n \n \n...then you must be branded as a typical knee jerk leftist reactionary which you obviously are.\n\n \n Is that you, Archie?",

All the JD is doing is exactly what the Tea Party says it wants.\n \n If people believe that the federal government is doing a bad job enforcing immigration law -- which I actually believe it is myself -- the appropriate response to that problem is to elect federal officials who will do something about it, not to have their state governments usurp the federal government's authority.\n \n The mosque in question was never to be at ground zero, but blocks away. And government has no business telling religious institutions where they can or can't build houses of worship anyway, at least not for any religious motivations.\n \n Meanwhile, despite his ongoing demonization at the hands of the bigoted theocrats of the Christian right, this man is doing more to change America's image amongst Muslims than any bombs over Baghdad ever could. I say, more power to him.\n \n If 2001-2009 didn't convince you that conservatives have no idea how to run an effective foreign policy, then nothing will.\n \n Again, fair. The process was a mess. Democrats should have found their spines.\n \n Baloney. The long-term benefits would save gobs of money.\n \n Come now. Your own Supreme Court cronies just made the 2010 GOP victory possible.\n \n Courts aren't supposed to be majoritarian institutions. Read the Federalist Papers.\n \n And besides, nobody pays less attention to what the Constitution actually says than the Tea Party. (Please refer again to the Arizona immigration issue above.)\n \n And many of the rest of us are scared as hell by ignorant masses who refuse to listen to reason, on anything from science to law.\n \n Half of them owned slaves, none of them were gods, and all of them had their personality quirks. But they were smart enough to recognize such shortcomings in themselves, which is why they really do deserve a lot of credit for being governmentally brilliant: They put together a government of laws, not of men -- including the men that they themselves were. So three cheers for 'em! Albeit not in the way that the Tea Party wants.\n \n It's no longer 1776 or 1789. Deal with it.\n \n And yet, every Tea Party demand, if enacted, will merely further the slide of America into completely unexceptional mediocrity.\n \n I suggest looking in a mirror. All the wrongs you believe are being inflicted upon you either are not actually happening or are the results of the very people you're voting for.\n \n A truly \"smart American\" would have come up with some thoughts of his own. Ya think?\n\n \n Let's face it - Pelosi, Reid, and Obama were disasters, as was Bill Clinton (under whose administration the sub prime mortage lending program was initiated) as was Barney Franks (the Democratic prom queen who had House oversite responsibility for Fannie and Freddie, and who gave them the green light - saying there was no problem there).\n \n BTW, how's that Hope and Change working out for you?

The economy did not again resume 4 percent annual growth until after the Republican Congress finally got Clinton to sign a capital-gains tax cut.\" \n \n Watch out for Liberal Revisionism!\n\n \n Why must you interject things you barely understand? I would be very interested in where you got this information. But anyway, my post asked when Clinton left office was there a budget surplus. The Answer is yes there was. When Bush left office was there a budget surplus? No we were back to deficit spending again. \n \n Here read your heart out\n \n \"The Clinton Presidency:\n Historic Economic Growth\n \n In 1993, President Clinton and Vice President Gore launched their economic strategy: (1) establishing fiscal discipline, eliminating the budget deficit, keeping interest rates low, and spurring private-sector investment; (2) investing in people through education, training, science, and research; and (3) opening foreign markets so American workers can compete abroad. After eight years, the results of President Clinton's economic leadership are clear. Record budget deficits have become record surpluses, 22 million new jobs have been created, unemployment and core inflation are at their lowest levels in more than 30 years, and America is in the midst of the longest economic expansion in our history.\n \n President Clinton's Record on the Economy: In 1992, 10 million Americans were unemployed, the country faced record deficits, and poverty and welfare rolls were growing. Family incomes were losing ground to inflation and jobs were being created at the slowest rate since the Great Depression. Today, America enjoys what may be the strongest economy ever.\n \n * Strong Economic Growth: Since President Clinton and Vice President Gore took office, economic growth has averaged 4.0 percent per year, compared to average growth of 2.8 percent during the Reagan-Bush years. The economy has grown for 116 consecutive months, the most in history.\n * Most New Jobs Ever Created Under a Single Administration: The economy has created more than 22.5 million jobs in less than eight years-the most jobs ever created under a single administration, and more than were created in the previous 12 years. Of the total new jobs, 20.7 million, or 92 percent, are in the private sector.\n * Median Family Income Up $6,000 since 1993: Economic gains have been made across the spectrum as family incomes increased for all Americans. Since 1993, real median family income has increased by $6,338, from $42,612 in 1993 to $48,950 in 1999 (in 1999 dollars).\n * Unemployment at Its Lowest Level in More than 30 Years: Overall unemployment has dropped to the lowest level in more than 30 years, down from 6.9 percent in 1993 to just 4.0 percent in November 2000. The unemployment rate has been below 5 percent for 40 consecutive months. Unemployment for African Americans has fallen from 14.2 percent in 1992 to 7.3 percent in October 2000, the lowest rate on record. Unemployment for Hispanics has fallen from 11.8 percent in October 1992 to 5.0 percent in October 2000, also the lowest rate on record.\n * Lowest Inflation since the 1960s: Inflation is at the lowest rate since the Kennedy Administration, averaging 2.5 percent, and it is down from 4.7 percent during the previous administration.\n * Highest Homeownership Rate on Record: The homeownership rate reached 67.7 percent for the third quarter of 2000, the highest rate on record. In contrast, the homeownership rate fell from 65.6 percent in the first quarter of 1981 to 63.7 percent in the first quarter of 1993.\n * 7 Million Fewer Americans Living in Poverty: The poverty rate has declined from 15.1 percent in 1993 to 11.8 percent last year, the largest six-year drop in poverty in nearly 30 years. There are now 7 million fewer people in poverty than there were in 1993.\n \n Establishing Fiscal Discipline and Paying off the National Debt\n \n President Clinton's Record on Fiscal Discipline: Between 1981 and 1992, the national debt held by the public quadrupled. The annual budget deficit grew to $290 billion in 1992, the largest ever, and was projected to grow to more than $455 billion by Fiscal Year (FY) 2000. As a result of the tough and sometimes unpopular choices made by President Clinton, and major deficit reduction legislation passed in 1993 and 1997, we have seen eight consecutive years of fiscal improvement for the first time in America's history.\n \n * Largest Surplus Ever: The surplus in FY 2000 is $237 billion-the third consecutive surplus and the largest surplus ever.\n * Largest Three-Year Debt Pay-Down Ever: Between 1998-2000, the publicly held debt was reduced by $363 billion-the largest three-year pay-down in American history. Under Presidents Reagan and Bush, the debt held by the public quadrupled. Under the Clinton-Gore budget, we are on track to pay off the entire publicly held debt on a net basis by 2009.\n * Lower Federal Government Spending: After increasing under the previous two administrations, federal government spending as a share of the economy has been cut from 22.2 percent in 1992 to 18 percent in 2000-the lowest level since 1966.\n * Reduced Interest Payments on the Debt: In 1993, the net interest payments on the debt held by the public were projected to grow to $348 billion in FY 2000. In 2000, interest payments on the debt were $125 billion lower than projected.\n * Americans Benefit from Reduced Debt: \n * Double Digit Growth in Private Investment in Equipment and Software: \n \n To Establish Fiscal Discipline, President Clinton:\n \n * Enacted the 1993 Deficit Reduction Plan without a Single Republican Vote. \n * Negotiated the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997. In his 1997 State of the Union address, President Clinton announced his plan to balance the budget for the first time in 27 years. Later that year, he signed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, a major bipartisan agreement to eliminate the national budget deficit, create the conditions for economic growth, and invest in the education and health of our people. \n * Dedicated the Surplus to Save Social Security and Reduce the National Debt. \n * Extended Medicare Solvency from 1999 to 2025. \n \n The Clinton Presidency: Historic Economic Growth\n \n The Clinton Presidency: Historic Economic Growth\n \n Yep, that Clinton really tanked the Nation huh?\n \n \n \nThe sub-prime mortgage fiasco started under your pet adulterer-in-chief, Slick Willie Clinton. From the NYTimes, Sept. 30, 1999:\n\n \n No it got a real start with Reagan when he eased restrictions on the S & L's who then proceeded to implode. If you want there was a warning that was it, because later on Clinton would bow to Republican and Democrat pressure from the financial industry to deregulate that sector and that is where the majority of blame goes. As for housing for the poor banks were getting as much as a 20% return on those loans. They were borrowing money so they could make those loans they were so profitable. Why because they got a bunch together and securitized them hid and then split the risk and dumped their risk and collateral tie up. Then they turned into iucking fidiots and started buying the toxic loans they just dumped.\n \n \n\"Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\"\n \n There was even a warning back then not to do it:\n \n \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980's.\"\n\n \n If only Republicans had listened. If your analysis was correct then how has Fannie been getting away with this since 1938? How about 1979 when Carter started pushing for affordable housing? It had been making those same loans since then with no problem, went thru a couple big recessions, but only got hurt due to deregulation bobo. Nice try though\n \n \nFannie Mae Eases Credit To Aid Mortgage Lending - New York Times\n \n That's right! Another brain-dead, liberal, big government program that turned into an absolute disaster.\n\n \n Another mindless sheep baaas in the night. \n \n And then your dumbocratic prom queen Barney Franks, who was chairman of the House Oversight Committee monitoring Fannie and Freddie, said:\n \n \"I think this is a case where Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are fundamentally sound. They're not in danger of going under. They're not the best investment these days from a long term standpoint going back. I think they are in good shape going forward. They're in the housing market. I do think their prospects going forward are very solid.\" \n \n Digg - Barney Frank: Freddie Mac/Fannie Mae fundamentally sound\n \n \n \n That's your swill that that was \"legislated from the bench.\" Every recount there ever was showed that Bush won.\n \n I hope it made you throw up, too.\n \n Watch out for liberal revisionism![/QUOTE]\n \n Talk about revisionism Why don't you tell the whole story knuckldragger?\n \n FRANK: No. You've misrepresented this consistently. I became chairman of the committee on January 31st, 2007. Less than two months later, I did what the Republicans hadn't been able to do in 12 years - get through the committee a very tough regulatory bill. And it passed the House in May.\n \n I've always felt two things about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, that they had an important role to play, but that the regulations should be improved.\n \n Now from 1995 to 2006, when the Republicans controlled Congress and we were in the minority, we couldn't get that done. Although in 2005, Mike Oxley, of Sarbanes-Oxley fame, a pretty tough guy on regulation, did try to put a bill through to regulate Fannie Mae. I worked with him on it. As he told The Financial Times, he thought ideological rigidity in the Bush administration stopped that.\n \n But the basic point is that the first time I had any real authority over this was January of 2007. And within two months, we had passed the bill that regulated.\n \n O'REILLY: OK. And that's true, all of that is true.\n \n FRANK: And then also, one other point: The Senate was dragging its feet, as often happens. And in January of 2008, I asked Secretary Paulson to put in the stimulus bill. So, the earliest chance I got to put tough regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we did it.\n \n \n Read more: Bill O'Reilly Battles Rep.

I see the need and I see the reasons for doing it, but the implementation was horrible. There are a dozen better ways it could have been done.\n \n As for the USCC I am surprised. You are aware they accept money from foreign nationals to influence US politics right? You are so pro-American government by the people I never would have thought for you those people did not need to be US citizens. Something new everyday.\n \n \n As for Glen Beck, there was a scientific and independent analysis done by a company that does crowd and detailed ariel photography They calculated their numbers independently and arrived at 80,000 and 87,000 which is within the MOE of 9,000. That puts him at from 71,000 to 96,000 any other estimate is pure guess. You can't honestly say 500,000 as a fact, it isn't.\n \n Same with there being no politics involved. I mean it is at the Lincoln Memorial are you kidding. They would have had to have it on the White House lawn to make a bigger political statement. The Tea Party coordinated it, staffed it and used their mailing list to advertise it along with invitations to political rallies the day before and after. Palin was there and so were other politicians who also did fund raising events for it. The list goes on, it wasn't touted as a political event, but politics was without question part of the program.\n \n I will have to respond later to Jon Stewart in all honesty I didn't pay very close attention to either of them so don't know if JS numbers are credible or your claims about political involvement.\n \n You had a good argument if you had just left it to health care and the election and left out the opinion trash",

   "I've missed a few pages of this post but I see that Zorba the Clown and Ez are still preaching as if they had won the election themselves..\n \n Come on.. join reality. The Teabaggers accomplished NOTHING except to split the Government into even more fractures. So they won the house. big freakin deal.. they still don't control the Senate or the White House so all the AMERICAN PEOPLE did was to assure that nothing gets done for at least the next two years. Just like most every mid-terms the Liberals didn't get out and vote . The largest Population of those Teabaggers were senior Citizens who are confused as to who, what and why they are even voting. They have been told that Liberals are the boogy man so they go out and vote in the teabaggers thinking it will bring forth all the wounderous changes they have been promised by the party nut bags who are moving to DC.\n \n Here's the truth... \n \n When the new Congress convenes next year all the new teabag freshmen will fall in line behind the old school repubs like good little boys and girls. They won't overturn Obama care.. because they CAN'T do it. \n 2: When Obama approaches them sometime early next year and asks the Government to raise the ceiling on the national debt they will have NO CHOICE but to say yes. If they don't they will in effect force a Government shutdown and they will all be one term congressmen and women.. and when they do say yes they will break their Promise to the teabaggers around the country of NO COMPROMISE.. and once again they will be one term and out... So the teabaggers winning Nov 2 is a Win Win for America. \n Then in 2012 the repubs have no one to seriously run against Obama and he will be elected to a second term. Americans are really not stupid enough to elect Palin.. Huckabee is a JOKE.. and once he's running full steam his record as Governor of Arkansas will kill his chances.. He was here 12 years and did absolutely nothing for this state. \n \n So all in all it's all good. We have two years to kick back and watch the show. The teabaggers will fail miserably and be run out of office at the first chance, and once again a DEMOCRAT will put America back on track like Clinton did before Bushy boy tore us apart... emoticon_xangel",
