   "Most of the debates on these forums that revolve around acceptable types of behaviour usually come back to one thing.\n \n Some people say it* is wrong, because the bible says it is wrong.\n \n To me, the obvious rejoinder is:\n \n Can you provide conclusive evidence which indicates that the bible being wholly true and accurate is the most likely of all possible theories or explanations?\n \n Because if you can't, it invalidates all other arguments.\n \n So far, in response to my query I've been given two links. One discusses relics found in a cave which appear to have early christian icons on them, dated at from the first century. The other link discussed the language and consistencies of the new testament, concluding that in the writers estimation, they were written in a truthful style.\n \n Neither link goes any way at all to providing hard proof for things which are currently held to be impossible, like the parting of the red sea or the great flood.\n \n I understand that people can have faith in the bible. What I want everyone who reads this to do is question that faith. Examine it and the bible as objectively as possible, find the reasons you believe it to be true. Then ask yourself if those reasons are good enough.\n \n Come on people, without proving beyond all reasonable doubt that the bible is wholly true and accurate, all other arguments from biblical texts are invalid. All of them.\n \n * - 'it' could be abortion, evolution, homosexuality, divorce, whatever.",

It astounds me how poorly many christians know the bible.\n \n Religion will never be proven either way, because it is a faith, belief in something without evidence or proof.",
