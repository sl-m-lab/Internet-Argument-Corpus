   "From CNN:Obama: Don't fear the future - CNN.com\n \n \n\"Look, I wish I had the luxury of just dealing with a modest recession or just dealing with health care or just dealing with energy or just dealing with Iraq or just dealing with Afghanistan,\" Obama said. \"I don't have that luxury, and I don't think the American people do, either.\"\n \n When asked if the United States was winning the war in Afghanistan, where he is sending another 17,000 troops, Obama replied, \"No.\"\n \n He said his administration is reviewing the U.S. policy toward Afghanistan and Pakistan, with the intention of finding a new strategy in the region. Obama said that reaching out to Sunni militant groups, such as the Taliban, to fight al Qaeda and other terror groups -- a tactic employed by Gen. David Petraeus in Iraq -- \"should be explored.\"\n \n \"If you talk to General Petraeus, I think he would argue that part of the success in Iraq involved reaching out to people that we would consider to be Islamic fundamentalists, but who were willing to work with us because they had been completely alienated by the tactics of al Qaeda in Iraq,\" Obama said. \n\n \n Good Lord, has this nutjob lost any grip on reality that he may have had?\n \n Does he not remember the reason we're IN Afghanistan (besides not knowing the history of our involvement in Afghanistan bak in Soviet Russia days in which we helped create and fund the people that started the Taliban)? \n \n Is he really going to go and spit on the graves of those who lost their lives in the 9/11 Attacks by allying our nation with their murderers?\n \n DISGUSTING.\n \n Get a clue, Obama.",

   "\n Good Lord, has this nutjob lost any grip on reality that he may have had?\n\n \n So you're saying that General P has lost his grip on reality too? Also that the Sri Lankan military has lost its grip on reality? That and Pakistan military has done so too? And that the Brits for decades have lost their grip on reality? \n \n Apparently you think that utilizing the strategy that has allowed nations to suppress insurgencies and produce stability is a sign one has \"lost any grip on reality.\" \n \n \nDoes he not remember the reason we're IN Afghanistan (besides not knowing the history of our involvement in Afghanistan bak in Soviet Russia days in which we helped create and fund the people that started the Taliban)? \n\n \n Apparently you think that the contemporary Taliban is the same group of people. LOL. \n \n \nIs he really going to go and spit on the graves of those who lost their lives in the 9/11 Attacks by allying our nation with their murderers?\n\n \n See above. \n \n \nDISGUSTING.\n \n Get a clue, Obama.\n\n \n Which is more disgusting:\n \n Refusing to implement a strategy that historically works and results in a viable country with lower costs in money, lives and material.\n \n OR\n \n Enacting a strategy that historically works and results in a viable country with lower costs in money, lives and material.",

   "Which part of using their former allies to fight the 911 murderers upsets you so much?\n\n \n It's not that. The modern fighter in the Taliban is not the same fighter 8 years ago. SOC fails to understand this simple concept. Furthermore he fails to understand history of insurgencies and how to successfully suppress them. Apparently he'd rather refuse to implement a strategy that was central to Iraq's turn around because he thinks that the Taliban 2001 is the same as Taliban 2009. \n \n I wonder what the soldiers he'd get killed would think about that.",

   "George Bush and Dick Cheney were ready to rock and roll with the Taliban on a deal to run an oil pipeline across Afghanistan before September 11, 2001:\n \nKhalilzad, a fellow Pashtun and the son of a former government official under King Mohammed Zahir Shah, was, in addition to being a consultant to the RAND Corporation, a special liaison between UNOCAL and the Taliban government. Khalilzad also worked on various risk analyses for the project.\n \n Khalilzad's efforts complemented those of the Enron Corporation, a major political contributor to the Bush campaign.... Vice President Cheney held several secret meetings with top Enron officials, including its Chairman Kenneth Lay, earlier in 2001. These meetings were presumably part of Cheney's non-public Energy Task Force sessions. A number of Enron stockholders, including Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, became officials in the Bush administration. In addition, Thomas White, a former Vice Chairman of Enron and a multimillionaire in Enron stock, currently serves as the Secretary of the Army.\n \n A chief benefactor in the CentGas deal would have been Halliburton, the huge oil pipeline construction firm that also had its eye on the Central Asian oil reserves. At the time, Halliburton was headed by Dick Cheney. After Cheney's selection as Bush's Vice Presidential candidate, Halliburton also pumped a huge amount of cash into the Bush-Cheney campaign coffers. And like oil cash cow Enron, there were Wall Street rumors in late December that Halliburton, which suffered a forty per cent drop in share value, might follow Enron into bankruptcy court.\n \n .... In December 1997, the Taliban visited UNOCAL's Houston refinery operations. Interestingly, the chief Taliban leader based in Kandahar, Mullah Mohammed Omar, now on America's international Most Wanted List, was firmly in the UNOCAL camp. His rival Taliban leader in Kabul, Mullah Mohammed Rabbani (not to be confused with the head of the Northern Alliance Burhanuddin Rabbani), favored Bridas, an Argentine oil company, for the pipeline project. But Mullah Omar knew UNOCAL had pumped large sums of money to the Taliban hierarchy in Kandahar and its expatriate Afghan supporters in the United States. Some of those supporters were also close to the Bush campaign and administration. And Kandahar was the city near which the CentGas pipeline was to pass, a lucrative deal for the otherwise desert outpost.\n\n CRG -- Getting used to the idea of double standards: The underlying maxim is \"we will punish the crimes of our enemies and reward the crimes of our friends\"",

   "Long term, the \"desirability\" of an oil pipeline from landlocked Turkmenistan through Afghanistan/Pakistan to the sea hasn't gone away. It avoids the current political and geographical necessity of Russian control over the source and transport. Soldiers will continue to die to feed the West's oil habit for a long time to come.",
