   "USA is going to organize one more velvet revolution, this time in Turkmenistan. The main aim of it is control over energy resources. It's interesting that on this occasion US' strategists decided to work by Ukrainian and Turkish special services channels http://www.ewole.com/zahodu.html .\n Well, Turkey and Ukraine officials believed in US promise that in case of successful end of revolution they will get cheap Turkmenistan's energy supplies. \n At the present time Turkey undertook obligations about opposition and youth nationalist organization of Turkmenistan preparing in training camps on the Turkey territory. \n Ukraine side in its part will organize provocations, sabotages and mass protest actions (journalists and political figures annihilation). \n Well, at US' suggestion Kiev and Ankara lean on financial and political support of such bigwigs as Boris Berezovsky and Mashkevich. Those two oligarchs represent the interests of Jewish lobby in the USA.\n According to US' Jewish lobby plan those 'businessmen' have to organize not only financial support but also give trustworthy persons for new government creation which will get the reins of government over the new US' satellite.",
