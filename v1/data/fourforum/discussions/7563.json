In John 8:1-11, Jesus keeps an adulteress from being stoned, which was the Law back then. In the Old Testament, you break one rule, you break them all. Sin is all the same in God's eyes. So, Jesus doesn't want homosexuals to be killed either. He just wants them to turn from their sin.",

I spent two tours in Vietnam and there's nothing about violence I find attractive. But good men do take a stand against evil when other people are getting butchered and oppressed. As someone once wrote, \"The only thing required for evil to triumph is for good men to say (and do) nothing.\"\n \n As for Jesus, I referred you to Romans 13 (note that all Scripture is inspired by God, who Jesus is) to show you that God instituted governments to be an agent of wrath against the wrongdoer (13:4). Jesus also brings a good number of judgments on the evil in the Book of Revelation, in case you missed that. Is he turning the other cheek then?\n \n Now answer the question I asked: Are you prepared to disarm the U.S. at this time and turn the other cheek when some more hijacked 767's slam into our office towers?

Likewise by the reasoning Stalin was the divinely appointed ruler of Russia, and as such his rule should not have been resisted.\n\n \n Again, going back to the Old Testament, when people or a nation got too corrupt, God (Jesus) raised up armies against them and overthrew them. When Israel / Jerusalem rejected Christ, he even prophesied their demise, i.e.\n \n Luke 19:41 As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it 42 and said, \"If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace-but now it is hidden from your eyes. 43 The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side. 44 They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God's (Christ's) coming to you.\"\n \n Now, are you going to answer my questions or ignore them again?\n \n Are you prepared to disarm the U.S. at this time and turn the other cheek when some more hijacked 767's slam into our office towers?
