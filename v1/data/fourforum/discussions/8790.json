   "As it has become known German Turk Murat Kurnaz got freed from Guantanamo after 4.5 years of extrajudicial detention. Kurnaz was held in Pakistan in 2001 and then accused by the US of being an Al-Qaeda member. Both German investigators, and US Army investigators failed to find any evidence of a tie between Kurnaz and Al-Qaeda or any involvement in terrorist activities. Kurnaz is one of the detainees who has alleged that he was subject to interrogation techniques that included suffocation by drowning, sexual humiliation, and the desecration of his religion. As it is asserted by various human rights organizations, many American nationals serve time in Guantanamo Bay prison being groundlessly accused of being an Al-Q member. It is said there are at least 26 of them there while about 450 inmates still remain in the prison. If you've got any missing relatives or friends check them up in Guantanamo Bay prison. If you succeed in finding them there, make sure you retain a good lawyer and make US Army pay for abusive treatment Guantanamo is famous with.",
