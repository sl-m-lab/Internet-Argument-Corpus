   "A number of different papers, mostly in New Zealand are running the results of a recent study done on the mental health probelms with youths with same sex attractions. Not that anyone should find this a surprise.....but they find gay youth have more depression, anxiety, substance use and suicide attempts than there straight counter parts. More specific they state that young gay males are five times more likely to develope mental health problems than heterosexual youth. WELL DUH!!!!!! You needed a study to figure this out! anyway my favorite part of one of the articles fits with my initial reaction and it was a quote from Neville Creighton of Auckland's Gay and Lesbian Welfare. He just about summed up my feelings on this......\n \n \"Neville Creighton of Auckland's Gay and Lesbian Welfare says if Professor Fergusson wants to discover the reasons for the poor state of mental health among young gays and lesbians, \"then let him come and ask us.\" Creighton says the findings of the paper are hardly rocket science. \"Is it any wonder? Here we have a group of people that are constantly bombarded with messages of how bad they are. They are XXXXXXX, pansies, sissies, perverts, disgusting,\" he says. \"Is it any wonder that their self esteem is so low that they wonder whether it is all worth it and they would be better off dead?\"  \n \n All welfare groups spoken to by GayNZ.com said political parties and religious groups who use GLBT issues and people as political branding exercises need to be aware of the damage they are causing to youth as a result.\"\n \n \n Here are some different sources on the matter. I would note that some didn't go into much detail but seem to stick with the same old same ole that gays are problems children....they never went into the rest of the facts. Sending the message that another study show how gays are messed up in the head, when the reality is, that is not what the study says at all.\n \n http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10338755\n http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3364398a7144,00.html\n http://www.gaynz.com/news/default.asp?dismode=article&artid=2670\n http://www.gaynz.com/news/default.asp?dismode=article&artid=2668\n http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/newsdetail1.asp?storyID=77385\n http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/08/080205suicide.htm",
