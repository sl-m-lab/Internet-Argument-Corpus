   "The democrats have finally put forth a REASONABLE budget position. This is not for the 2012 budget, just the one that covers the rest of this year. \n \n Top Democrat draws line in sand in budget fight | Reuters\n \n \nDurbin, one of President Barack Obama's top allies in Congress, said he opposed going beyond the $10.5 billion in domestic, non-defense discretionary spending cuts that Democrats have backed.\n \n Republicans want $61 billion in spending reductions.\n \n \"I think we've pushed this to the limit,\" Durbin told the \"Fox News Sunday\" television program as Congress and the White House prepared for another week of showdowns that threaten a government shutdown.\n \n \"To go any further is to push more kids out of school,\" Durbin said. \"It stops the investment of infrastructure, which kills good-paying jobs right here in the United States.'\n \n \"I'm willing to see more deficit reduction, but not out of domestic discretionary spending,\" Durbin said.\n\n \n Some qualifiers are needed here. First, I dont think that the budget cuts offered by EITHER party are anywhere near big enough. That said, we need to look at reality here and accept that there is no way a RESPONSIBLE budget is going to be passed, and an additional $57 billion in cuts is all we can really hope for.\n \n With reality being what it is, I think that the democrats position here is reasonable, and I think that they are finally getting their heads around this thing. Now the question will be whether the republicans will be willing to be reasonable or not. \n \n If the democrats are really willing to put this on the table, I think the republicans have to jump at it. If not, and we end up with a government shutdown at this point, the blame is going to end up in the republicans lap, which is where it would deserve to be.\n \n While the democrats refusal to pass ANY cuts was ridiculous, for the republicans to now insist that ALL the cuts come out of the smallest part of the governments budget is likewise ridiculous. \n \n Now we get to see which of the republicans are real deficit hawks and which are chicken hawks. \n \n We are also going to get to watch a bunch of CINOs throw a hissy fit and claim that the democrats are putting us in grave danger by even suggesting defense cuts, and that they are \"gutting\" the military.\n \n To put that into perspective, if we assume the additional $10.5 billion in cuts goes through, we are looking at shaving roughly 6% off our defense budget.\n \n For nearly 20 year now the pentagon has routinely been unable to account for a full TWENTY FIVE percent of their budget. They simply have no idea where all that money goes. \n \n We are going to step into the way back machine for a minute. Here is a story from CBS Jan 29, 2002:\n \n The War On Waste - CBS Evening News - CBS News\n \n \nMore money for the Pentagon, CBS News Correspondent Vince Gonzales reports, while its own auditors admit the military cannot account for 25 percent of what it spends.\n \n \"According to some estimates we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions,\" Rumsfeld admitted.\n \n $2.3 trillion - that's $8,000 for every man, woman and child in America. To understand how the Pentagon can lose track of trillions, consider the case of one military accountant who tried to find out what happened to a mere $300 million.\n \n\n \n This is better today though, right? I mean, the republicans were in charge, so they must have taken care of what is obviously a HUGE amount of government waste. \n \n Not so much. It has kept getting worse and worse over the last decade until finally last December the GAO issued this statement:\n \n \n\"Even though significant progress has been made since the enactment of key financial management reforms in the 1990s, our report on the U.S. government's consolidated financial statement illustrates that much work remains to be done to improve federal financial management. Shortcomings in three areas again prevented us from expressing an opinion on the accrual-based financial statements.\"\n \n (1) serious financial management problems at the Department of Defense that made its financial statements unauditable, \n (2) the federal government's inability to adequately account for and reconcile intragovernmental activity and balances between federal agencies, and \n (3) the federal government's ineffective process for preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n \n I cannot even imagine how bad things have to be over at DOD to make them \"unauditable\". Does their accounting documentation consist solely of photocopies of people buttocks and doodles of rabbits breeding? \n \n Steeeve, you are an accountant. Exactly how bad do things have to be before your auditor throws their hands up and goes \"screw it...I cant get anything at all here\". Especially when they have funds transfer records from the treasury dept to start with. \n \n So...uh...yea....we could probably get away with cutting 30% of the DODs budget and as long as they dont publicize it until after the fact, the DOD may not even notice. They will just assume they dropped that other $200 billion somewhere between the bathroom and their desk and it rolled down under the carpet or something. \n \n So...thoughts??? Anybody care to name names as far as which republicans will turn out to be for real and which were just trying to yank the democrats chain?\n \n Also, there is one more thing I wanted to toss out here. The GAO just did a big study on the government and identified a whole bunch of inefficiencies such as overlapping program responsibilities, etc... \n \n I have read several places where various politicians have advocated giving time to work through that report and see what they can do about eliminating some of those inefficiencies before they take a real ax to discretionary spending. The logic seems to be that in doing so they will have a truer picture of what they can, should, and will cut. \n \n At first I wrote that off as yet another BS delaying tactic. Now I am having second thoughts. If you go in to restructure a company, the first thing you do is not cut 40% of your production staff and stop buying toilet paper. The first thing you do is look for efficiency gains. Once that is dont, you move forward. \n \n As long as they do it in a timely manner, I am not opposed to waiting to see the action on the GAO report before we cut much more discretionary spending (but the cuts should DEFINITELY be in the 2012 budget)",

It basically says that the auditors believe the financial statements are somewhat ok but we can't tell you with 100% confidence they are 100% accurate but we did a bunch of tests and based upon those we think they are close enough. In other words, the auditors word it so you only have to be ballpark at best to get a clean opinion.

With these you could STILL walk them through it like a baby and get a report on the other side with a clean opinion because at least all the invoices are in the computer or in a nice pile in an office and the client has bank statements. \n \n So that should give you an idea about how pathetic this is.",

The way I see it, they said \"out of $57 billion we are willing to take 10 out of this category. Get the rest elsewhere\".\n \n And I think that is a fairly reasonable position to take. It is certainly a good one from a political standpoint. If we end up with a government shutdown the dems can now point the finger and say \"The republicans refused to cut .25% out of the DODs trillion dollar budget\".\n \n I dont know that at this point they should even try to figure out specifically which programs to cut. This late in the year it is likely to be tricky figuring out what programs have already spent their money and which have not. Make the $47 billion cut then call Gates and let him work it out.",

   "I think we have to get real here. The will to handle the budget, or even balance the budget, has to be a priority. The priority in the U.S. is power, even if it means the demise of the U.S. There is no common sense, since it has nothing to do with governing. 1+1 = 2 no matter how you cut it. Granted there may be some better ways of handling the screwed up economy were in, i.e., perhaps we should have gotten serious about overhauling all government infrastructure that is, say 30 years or older, which would have kept people working verses getting unemployment checks. It would have kept plants manufacturing commodities and equipment needed, not to mention jobs. Cutting back on anything other than military (since were about 10 times mightier than our next 20 nations combined) is counter productive. Yes, most government programs including taxes need revamping, but to pick on the most vulnerable Americans is absolutely counter productive and will be the demise of those who do.
