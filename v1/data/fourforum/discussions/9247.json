   "Brady Campaign to Stop Car Violence: Election Is Mandate for Race Car Ban\n \n (BENEZRA) The Republican-led Brady Campaign to Stop Car Violence announced today that the results of last week's election, which gave control of the Senate and House to Democrats, show that the public is demanding a ban on race cars.\n \n \"Race cars have no legitimate transportation purpose,\" said Republican Paul Helmke, head of the Brady Campaign. \"You don't need a Ford Focus to tow a boat. It would pull the boat to smithereens.\" He added, \"We're not trying to take anybody's cars, we just want to get deadly race cars like the Ford Focus and Honda Civic off the streets.\"\n \n In an appearance with Senator Dianne Feinstein (DLC-CA), activists explained why banning race cars is so important. \"Unlike conventional cars, race cars don't have to be steered, but merely pointed in the general direction of where you want to go,\" explained Tom Diaz of the Vehicle Policy Center (VPC). \"And the rear wings on these cars enable them to slide sideways around corners.\"\n \n \"I'm tired of 13-year-olds running down 8-year-olds with NASCAR stockers,\" said a spokesperson for the Democratic Leadership Council, which has made the race-car ban its top legislative priority since the early 1990's. \"We need to get these deadly race cars off the streets. They are the transportation of choice for bank robbers and drunk drivers.\"\n \n \"Race cars like the Honda Civic are truly vehicles of mass destruction whose only purpose is to outrun as many police cars as possible without having to refuel,\" added John Rosenthal, head of the Massachusetts-based Stop Car Violence. \"Many of these cars are designed to go 350 mph.\"\n \n Helmke also noted that if someone snapped and went on a road rage incident, driving a Civic would make them much more dangerous than if they were driving a more conventional vehicle like a Chevrolet Suburban. \"This is just common sense car control. Our bill doesn't affect responsible car owners. We're not trying to take away anybody's Hummer H2; our bill specifically targets race cars like the Mazda 3.\"\n \n Incoming senate Democrat Jim Webb, an opponent of the ban who recently defeated Allen Macacawitz in the Virginia senate race, objected to the proposed ban. \"Banning sport compact cars is stupid, doesn't help address drunk driving, and is guaranteed to #### off car owners. Congress has bigger fish to fry, like figuring out what to do with Iraq, helping people who don't have health insurance, and stopping the flood of jobs going overseas.\"\n \n Feinstein dismissed Webb's concerns as right-wing gibberish. \"Everybody knows that the #1 threat to this country is people driving race cars on the highway,\" she said. \"Al Qaida wants to buy Honda Civics with wings so they can destroy our freedom. They hate us for our freedom. Oh, wait, that was George's line.\"\n \n President George W. Bush, a supporter of the Race Car Ban, said he'd sign the ban if it gets to his desk. \"I don't think its a good thing in our society for people to have these cars,\" said the President, reading from a Teleprompter. \"It's just Unammerican. They should drive pickup trucks instead. Only terrorists and illegals would want to drive Civics.\" He added that no civilian car needs a rear wing. \"You know, wings are for flying, and, uh, cars aren't supposed to fly.\"\n \n The Race Car Ban of 2006 bans all compact cars with two or more of the following racing features:\n \n Four valves per cylinder\n Aerodynamic spoiler or wing that protrudes conspicuously above the trunk lid or rear deck\n Air dam\n Hood scoop\n Chrome exhaust tip\n Levitation lights\n Afterburner\n \n \n The Race Car Ban would also ban the following race cars by name:\n \n Honda Civic (all models)\n Subaru Impreza WRX\n Mitsubushi Lancer (all models)\n Honda S2000\n Volvo S40\n Mazda 3 and Protoge\n Toyota Corolla\n Scion (all models)\n Saturn Ion\n Bentley Speed 8\n NHRA Top Fuel dragster\n Caterpillar D9\n Boeing 737\n Airbus A380\n \n \n In order to reassure car owners, the bill's sponsors included a long list of non-race cars that are not affected by the legislation:\n \n BMW 3-series\n Cadillac CTS-V\n Cadillac Escalade\n Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe\n Ford Edsel\n Ford Model T\n Ford Mustang (without wing and spoiler)\n Ford F-150\n Hummer (all models)\n Jeep Cherokee\n John Deere Tractor\n Kenworth T2000\n Sopwith Camel\n \n \n The bill also makes it a felony to own a car manufactured after Sept. 14th, 1994, that has a fuel capacity of more than ten U.S. gallons of fuel.\n \n \n (by benEzra.
