   "A Gay Antichrist? \n \n Remember when Jerry Falwell said that the Antichrist is a Jewish male that is alive today? Well, now we find out that the Antichrist is also gay! And it seems that both ideas (that AC is Jewish and gay) are taken from the very same verse:\n \n \"Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall exalt himself above them all.\" Daniel 11:37 \n \n Dwindling In Unbelief: A Gay Antichrist?\n \n For the record, Daniel 11:37 has long been regarded as being prophetic of the antichrist, and numerous websites attest to it, i.e. 46 Prophecies the AntiChrist will fulfill .\n \n Satan and the Antichrist mimic God. With God there&#8217;s the Holy Trinity. Satan has his also (Satan, the False Prophet, and the Beast). God has a throne, and so does Satan (Rev. 2:12). God has his prophets and so does Satan. Jesus (God) was resurrected after being slain. Same with the Beast in Rev. 13:3. God has Holy Matrimony, and Satan his counterfeit, gay sex / gay marriage. There&#8217;s numerous things that Satan has similar to God, but they are all counterfeits. \n \n A gay antichrist, then, would make a lot of sense, Biblically speaking, especially considering Daniel 11:37.

Easy my desire to to silence no one, nor to hinder one's beliefs. It is a two way street when it comes to rights especially when it is that of religion.\n \n However you wish to deny me my civil rights because your right to express religion somehow oversteps it's boundaries into influencing the Constitution.\n \n Sorry Easy not gonna let that happen on my watch...\n \n \n \n \nNo, that's you - when you call the Word of God (which would include the salvation of Jesus Christ) - a fairytale. Yes YOU, who previously claimed to be a Christian but have shown it was just an act. \n \n \n Easy my faith is in logic and the relevancy of the spiritual in today's world.

Do not threaten me with something that may turn out to only be a work of fiction...\n \n \nI'm telling you what the Bible says, that it's either Christ or the wrath of God (John 3:36, etc.).

And that isn't any hope at all.\n\n \n Easy Hope is in life itself for all people. Hope is given and hope is something that connects all humans.

It should not be legitimized as if it's something positive. It leads people to an eternity of perdition and terror in Hell unless they repent. That's your unbridled legacy for the world.\n\n \n Easy my sexuality has not led me to anything hellish. My sexuality had no bearing upon others and still doesn't. It is peoples reaction and their misconception such as yours that leads to fear, anger, and bitter hatred....\n \n \n \nMore absolute nonsense.  \n\n \n Easy your entire post I am replying to is utter nonsense...\n \n \nGodly love does not rejoice in iniquity. And, as Romans says, 'Love does a neighbor no harm,' as in enticing one's neighbor into an illicit, sinful, gay sex relationship. \n\n \n Once again selective love based upon your ideals of what a God should be...

It's not by works.\n \n Titus 3:3 - At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures.

Their arrogance and spiritual numbness remind me of Proverbs 30:20 -\n \n \"This is the way of an adulteress: \n She eats and wipes her mouth \n and says, 'I've done nothing wrong.' \n \n Rephrased:\n \n \"This is the way of the gay sex sinner: \n He/She eats and wipes his/her mouth \n and says, 'I've done nothing wrong.'\n \n One other thing.
