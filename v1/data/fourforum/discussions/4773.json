   "The male-female analogy also misses the gay-straight dynamic in important ways. In the male-female context, the anticipated sexual aggressors (heterosexual males) are in the majority. Their aggression is often approved and even encouraged by their peers. Under those circumstances, the need for formalized separation from the objects of their desire is understandable.\n \n In the gay-straight context, on the contrary, the anticipated sexual aggressors (known gays) are a tiny minority of the whole. Their aggression is disapproved by their peers, and therefore far less likely to occur or be as intimidating when it does.\n \n Because straight men and women are the overwhelming majority in the military, the expected problems associated with mixing them in close quarters would be frequent and widespread. Mixing straights with a tiny number of openly gay personnel, on the other hand, would occasion comparatively few incidents. To say it would impair the military's effectiveness is silly.\n \n Too, the military separates men and women because it rightly assumes that at least some of the attraction between them will be mutual. We separate straight men and women because they can't keep their hands off each other.\n \n Yet straight men, some of whom recoil even at homosexual body heat, would be the first to say they'll be strictly hands-off with gay men.

I'm sure the men and woman can act professionally as well.\n \n My issue with this isn't that gay people can't act professionally--of course they can. So can straight people. It's just that we tend to separate people who have to tendency to be attracted to others sexually, whether it be the military, mens/women's restrooms in general, men's and women's prisons, etc. (Of course the straight people won't be attracted to the gay ones of the same gender, but the gay people will be attracted to the straight ones of the same gender--that's what I meant by my comment about me as a straight person not wanting to be in a shower room with a gay man. I wasn't trying to sound as though they would be attracted to me or not; that's not the point. It's more a modesty issue. And I certainly wasn't trying to imply I didn't think they could act professionally.) \n \n Since there is no way to feasibly separate gay men from straight men, or lesbians from straight women, it presents a problem. That's one reason we have a DADT policy in the military. Because of close proximity of the men and women with people of the own gender, and because of modesty issues, it's probably best not to know.
