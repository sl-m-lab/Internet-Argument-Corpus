   "Kenneth Miller, cell biologist at Brown University and devout Roman Catholic, gave a presentation at Case Western last year in which he thoroughly debunked ID and explained the trainwreck for the Dover defendants. Although he didn't speak much of his religion, he made it quite clear that he has no problem reconciling evolution and Christianity.\n \n Considering the hubbub here, it's worth a look. The lecture itself comprises the first 70 minutes or so, and there are another ~45 minutes of questions.\n \n youtube link.",
