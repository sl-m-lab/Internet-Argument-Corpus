Sins vary according to the following condiserations.\n \n The highest degree of sin must be seriously wrong, you must know that it is seriously wrong, and you must give \"full\" consent.\n \n The least degree of sin would be one that wasn't wrong, or that you didn't know was wrong, or that you didn't give \"full\" consent.\n \n You can see from the above that if you believe something is a sin, it is, although not very serious.

   "Old topic but looked interesting. Sin is equal. Sins are not.\n \n The issue of having sin (sort of an inhabiting entity in the human) is determined by belief in Jesus. When we are justified by Christ then we are justified meaning that God not only declares us Not guilty but that he writes on our account \"Righteous\". That is the christian concept of justification.\n \n Sins are individual behaviors that God abhors. Jesus in the sermon on the mount declared that looking at another with hatred in your heart equals the sin of murder.\n \n They are essentially the same to God. Because God hates all sin. Because He knows what it does to us. Any sin is an abomination to God. This is the standard of a Perfect God. With humans it appears very subjective because we think, \"at least I'm not as bad as him!\" \n \n Lurch the scripture you posted concerning the pharasaical law was to point out that what the pharisees called sin wasn't really a sin. Your other items point to sin compared with good, punishment compared with reward. That only proves crim's point that they are equal. Either good or bad not some better than others. Rewards are based upon your faithfulness with what you have been given.\n \n A very old topic but I am interested if any of the newer folks have looked at it and have comments.",

THE GRAVITY OF SIN: MORTAL AND VENIAL SIN \n \n 1854 Sins are rightly evaluated according to their gravity. The distinction between mortal and venial sin, already evident in Scripture, 129 became part of the tradition of the Church. It is corroborated by human experience.\n \n 1855 Mortal sin destroys charity in the heart of man by a grave violation of God's law; it turns man away from God, who is his ultimate end and his beatitude, by preferring an inferior good to him. \n \n Venial sin allows charity to subsist, even though it offends and wounds it. \n \n 1856 Mortal sin, by attacking the vital principle within us - that is, charity - necessitates a new initiative of God's mercy and a conversion of heart which is normally accomplished within the setting of the sacrament of reconciliation: \n \n When the will sets itself upon something that is of its nature incompatible with the charity that orients man toward his ultimate end, then the sin is mortal by its very object . . . whether it contradicts the love of God, such as blasphemy or perjury, or the love of neighbor, such as homicide or adultery.... But when the sinner's will is set upon something that of its nature involves a disorder, but is not opposed to the love of God and neighbor, such as thoughtless chatter or immoderate laughter and the like, such sins are venial. 130 \n \n 1857 For a sin to be mortal, three conditions must together be met: \"Mortal sin is sin whose object is grave matter and which is also committed with full knowledge and deliberate consent.\" 131 \n \n 1858 Grave matter is specified by the Ten Commandments, corresponding to the answer of Jesus to the rich young man: \"Do not kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and your mother.\" 132 The gravity of sins is more or less great: murder is graver than theft. One must also take into account who is wronged: violence against parents is in itself graver than violence against a stranger. \n \n 1859 Mortal sin requires full knowledge and complete consent. It presupposes knowledge of the sinful character of the act, of its opposition to God's law. It also implies a consent sufficiently deliberate to be a personal choice. Feigned ignorance and hardness of heart 133 do not diminish, but rather increase, the voluntary character of a sin. \n \n 1860 Unintentional ignorance can diminish or even remove the imputability of a grave offense. But no one is deemed to be ignorant of the principles of the moral law, which are written in the conscience of every man. The promptings of feelings and passions can also diminish the voluntary and free character of the offense, as can external pressures or pathological disorders. Sin committed through malice, by deliberate choice of evil, is the gravest. \n \n 1861 Mortal sin is a radical possibility of human freedom, as is love itself. It results in the loss of charity and the privation of sanctifying grace, that is, of the state of grace. If it is not redeemed by repentance and God's forgiveness, it causes exclusion from Christ's kingdom and the eternal death of hell, for our freedom has the power to make choices for ever, with no turning back. However, although we can judge that an act is in itself a grave offense, we must entrust judgment of persons to the justice and mercy of God. \n \n 1862 One commits venial sin when, in a less serious matter, he does not observe the standard prescribed by the moral law, or when he disobeys the moral law in a grave matter, but without full knowledge or without complete consent. \n \n 1863 Venial sin weakens charity; it manifests a disordered affection for created goods; it impedes the soul's progress in the exercise of the virtues and the practice of the moral good; it merits temporal punishment. Deliberate and unrepented venial sin disposes us little by little to commit mortal sin. However venial sin does not break the covenant with God. With God's grace it is humanly reparable. \"Venial sin does not deprive the sinner of sanctifying grace, friendship with God, charity, and consequently eternal happiness.\" 134 \n \n While he is in the flesh, man cannot help but have at least some light sins. But do not despise these sins which we call \"light\": if you take them for light when you weigh them, tremble when you count them. A number of light objects makes a great mass; a number of drops fills a river; a number of grains makes a heap. What then is our hope? Above all, confession. 135\n \n 1864 \"Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.\" 136 There are no limits to the mercy of God, but anyone who deliberately refuses to accept his mercy by repenting, rejects the forgiveness of his sins and the salvation offered by the Holy Spirit. 137 Such hardness of heart can lead to final impenitence and eternal loss. \n Scripture:\n A)  All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin which is not mortal. 1 John 5:17\n \n B)  Do you not know that the unjust will not inherit the kingdom of God?

Also the following verses clearly indicate that we (believers are not of this condition\n \n 18 (33) We know that (34) no one who is born of God sins; but He who was born of God (35) keeps him, and (36) the evil one does not (37) touch him. \n 19 (38) We know that (39) we are of God, and that (40) the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. \n 20 And (41) we know that (42) the Son of God has come, and has (43) given us understanding so that we may know (44) Him who is true; and we (45) are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. (46) This is the true God and (47) eternal life. \n \n Again with 1cor6:10 this refers to unbelievers. We see this because in the verses that follow Paul refers again to believers and says you were washed, sanctified and justified. Past tense with continuing effects.\n \n as for Eph 5:5 Paul goes on to clarify in the following verses that 5 refers to unbelievers and that the following verses say that (5:8) we are now children of light. \n \n Paul warns us not to live like the unbeliever for their sake and for our sake but never for our eternal soul.\n \n I still think that God sees all sin as sin. Why would Jesus say that to look at another woman with lust was equal to adultery or that hatred equals murder?\n \n I disagree with the catholic church on this. One cannot lose their salvation as that would require Christs sacrifice again and mean that it was worthless because that would mean that it was not a gift of grace from god but was earned (wages). God has given us life freely if we only accept it. Once accepted it cannot be thrown away as God says \"I will REMOVE their sins from them as far as the east from the west.\" He also says \"nothing can separate us from the love of God\" He also says that \"I will take their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh\" How then can we undo the works of God? We cannot.",

   " 1Jn 5:17 - The word death (you quote as mortal) refers only to the physical death of the believer not the spiritual death. Also the following verses clearly indicate that we (believers are not of this condition\n\n \n Not \"Death\", \"Dead\", or \"&#61553;&#61537;&#61550;&#61537;&#61556;&#61551;&#61550;\" is the actual Greek translation. \"Mortal Sin\" is often referred as \"Deadly Sin\". It does not refer to physical death, and 1 John is about spirituality. \n \n \n Paul warns us not to live like the unbeliever for their sake and for our sake but never for our eternal soul.\n\n \n One is an unbeliever if he is in mortal sin. Remember, mortal sin is a separation from God, goodness. If one is in mortal sin, they certain must repent to become a true believer. If they intend on going to confession, but die, they are forgiven. If they don't intend on going to confession, and die, they will not be forgiven, and will, to be blunt, be damned. \n \n \n I still think that God sees all sin as sin. Why would Jesus say that to look at another woman with lust was equal to adultery or that hatred equals murder?\n\n \n Please provide scripture for this. \n \n \n God has given us life freely if we only accept it\n\n \n Yes, he gives it to us freely, but we must accept it. And to accept it we must also follow the Christian code- no murder, no other Gods, et cetera. One of these Christian laws is staying away from mortal sin. WE can freely go to confession and have Christ forgiven our sins.",

   " 1) Incorrect, the correct translation is death. And it is speaking of physical death as John is speaking of conduct on earth. He is not speaking of death in the spiritual sense.\n\n \n Let's find out.\n \n  . 5:10 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in him: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he hath not believed in the witness that God hath borne concerning his Son. 5:11 And the witness is this, that God gave unto us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 5:12 He that hath the Son hath the life; he that hath not the Son of God hath not the life. 5:13 These things have I written unto you, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, even unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God.  5:14 And this is the boldness which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us: 5:15 and if we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him. 5:16 If any man see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and God will give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: not concerning this do I say that he should make request. 5:17 All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death. 5:18 We know that whosoever is begotten of God sinneth not; but he that was begotten of God keepeth himself, and the evil one toucheth him not. 5:19 We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in the evil one. 5:20 And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life. \n \n Obviously, it wouldn't make sense if John was talking about physical death. \n \n \n 2) It is not the mortal sin that makes one an unbeliever it is the fact that you are an unbeliever that you are dead. John 3:16\n\n \n This death is the deadly sin. When you are in mortal sin, you're living in spiritual death.\n \n \n 3) Try the sermon on the mount. Also: \"If anyone has broken any part of the law he is guilty of breaking the whole law.\" Roamns (unsure of chapter and verse)\n\n \n Okay, I thought you were talking about this verse. Christ isn't saying that the sins are equal, he's saying that people shouldn't judge as they have sinned as well. He never specified the sins either, except for the woman's.\n \n \n 4)He gives freely and we must except. There is no \"in order to accept we must..........\" John 3:16. Also Abraham believed and it was accounted to him as righteousness also the entire book of Hebrews.\n\n \n What is the entire bible? The entire bible is how to be saved. There are obviously some requirements for salvation. We can't simply arbitrarily say we can have salvation and continue to sin.\n \n Early Church fathers say:\n \n  \"Watch for your life's sake. Let not your lamps be quenched, nor your loins unloosed; but be ready, for you know not the hour in which our Lord comes. But you shall assemble together often, seeking the things which are befitting to your souls: for the whole time of your faith will not profit you, if you be not made complete in the last time\" (The Didache 16, 71 AD).\n \n  \"And as many of them . . . as have repented, shall have their dwelling in the tower [i.e., the Church]. And those of them who have been slower in repenting shall dwell within the walls. And as many as do not repent at all, but abide in their deeds, shall utterly perish. . . . But if any one relapse into strife, he will be cast out of the tower, and will lose his life. Life is the possession of all who keep the commandments of the Lord\" (The Shepherd 3:8:7, 80 AD)\n \n  \"And pray without ceasing in behalf of other men; for there is hope of the repentance, that they may attain to God. For cannot he that falls arise again, and he may attain to God?\" (A Letter to the Ephesians 10, 110 AD).",

It is not how to be saved. It is God's revelation of himself. jesus was the physical word of God. The bible is the written word of God. The bible is also the breathed word of God. It isn't a \"how to\" book. It is a \"who is\" book.",
