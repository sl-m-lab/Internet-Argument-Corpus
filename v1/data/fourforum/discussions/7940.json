   "\"First cars\" could be a whole new thread, but it's well enough under way here - may I continue? :) \n \n My first was a 48 F-1 Ford pickup. Six years older than me!! It had been sitting for years in a field of a farm where I worked as a lad of 13. (about 2 miles from home - rode my bicycle back and fourth) The engine was locked up, but it wasn't the original flathead engine. It had been converted to a mid fifties Oldsmobile engine. Re-welded mounts, and an adaptor plate to couple it to the original truck transmission. It had Oldsmobile~ROCKET~on the valve covers. Impressive eh? I wasn't impressed - I was as much a Ford guy then as I am now. But the farmer assured me that the best way to get it running would be to find another Olds engine like it. He required $40 worth of farm work for it, and it was mine! After earning another $40 (the going price for used engines at that time) he took me to a junkyard to get an engine for it, and we sat it in on the farm with the tractor & boom. Then early one Sunday morning (when traffic was lightest) I pulled it to my house all by my 13 year old self with his tractor & V tow bar. Quite a feeling to watch that thing follow me home!\n \n Needless to say, in the 2+ years I had before I could get my drivers licence, I had plenty of time to get it ready, and ready it was when I was 16! An orange brush-paint job (with 2 6\" spray can racing stripes) some nice wide Chrysler Imperial rims & 14\" tires, and dual exhausts peeking out from under the rear bumper! It looked just fine in the high school parking lot! Pickups weren't very common in 1971, especially among teenagers. \n \n Always had trouble with that truck, mainly the engine - it didn't last. Replaced it in a little over a year with a 50 F-2. (Cannibalized the 48) It had the original flathead V-8, it was a good old truck. I still had it a few years later when I bought the only new vehicle I ever bought - a 74 F-100. Got a picture of them side by side when the 74 was only about a week old. Ended up driving the 74 for 20 years! By the time I was 38 years old, it dawned on me that I had that truck for half my life! Pretty well worn out by then, but the cab & doghouse didn't have much rust. Later used them on a 1 ton frame. Not running today, but I still have it. \n \n Funny thing is, when I was fixing up that 48 it seemed like it was ancient - it was about 20 years old at the time. I have a 71 F-250 in my garage right now (almost done) and it doesn't seem that old to me, and it's 35 years old!!!! I guess it's MY age that's changed my perspective!! :)",
