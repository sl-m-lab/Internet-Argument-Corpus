Require media networks to pay into the public treasury the bulk of the annual rental value of the publicly-owned airwaves to which they enjoy exclusive access, and thereby reverse the monopolistic control that a mere handful of corporations currently exerts over those airwaves.

Wind is expensive and intermitten, PV is even MORE expensive and the environmental costs in building the panels far outweigh the energy savings. \n \n Look into biomass gasification.

   "I. Taxes\n 1. Eliminate most of the current complication in the tax code. Keep the current progressive system and raise the taxes on highest incomes.\n 2. Eliminate dividend taxes forever and cut the capital gains tax further. \n 3. Impose additional excise taxes on tobacco and alcoholic beverages.\n \n II. Spending Savings\n 1. Dismantle the current system of massive contract awards that restrict all government contracts to large businesses. This will greatly reduce costs to the government.\n 2. Do a better job of shopping around for services and product to further reduce waste.\n 3. Refuse to sign any bill packed with pork.\n 4. Restrict salaries paid by the government. (The only thing one of our boards for something did at its first meeting was set the salary at $500,000. Absurd. They make more than the president.)\n \n III. Social Programs\n 1. Establish government-funded health insurance for anyone employed and making less than $30,000 per year. \n 2. Pay welfare and social services staff more money to attract people better suited to do the job. Establish guidelines to force certain people to be cut off.\n \n IV. Foreign Policy\n 1. Pull out of the UN.\n 2. Create a free trade agreement for the free nations of Africa. Put more aid MONEY into the stable democracies to create wealth.\n 3. Reopen official relations with Taiwan.\n 4. Increase the size of the US military and use our forces wherever they are needed.\n 5. Close most of the European bases and shift forces to the new hot spots. Dismantle the Cold War military. \n 6. Ignore the Western Europeans a little more. Focus instead on Eastern Europe, former Soviet republics, Middle East, and Africa.\n \n V. Social Policy\n 1. Create civil partnerships with the same benfits as marriage. No gay marriage.\n 2. Add required classes to schools on families.\n \n VI. Education\n 1. Gited Students\n A. Mandatory testing to identify gifted students early and place them in gifted programs.\n B. Federally mandate those gifted programs and provide additional federal funding for them. \n 2. Spilt levels of ability in high schools. Stick the bottom, low, and top students in seperate schools\n 3. Eliminate Head Start. It has almost no effectiveness whatsoever.\n 4. Amend the constitution and allow the federal government to distribute education money from a state pool. Rich districts are offering Japanese while poor ones are being forced to cut everything but required classes. It is not fair whatsoever.\n 5. Create a federal lottery and offer college scholarships from the money made. That's what Florida does... anyone who can get the grades will have 100% of their education paid for just from the state lottery. Supplement education with the additional funds. \n 6. Allow any twice failing district's (as determined by tests) students to recieve vouchers to attend private schools. This forces districts to do better or they will lose students and thus money.\n \n VII. Environmental\n 1. Pour money into hydrogen fuel cell development.\n 2. Build more nuclear plants.\n 3. Provide tax breaks for people to ditch old cars. Most of the pollution produced by cars is from less than 10% of the cars on the road.\n 4. Allow trimming in the forests.",

   "I think we'd end up killing each other over taxes.\n \n The way I see it... the more you make, the more you should pay. Rich people have the money to pay. One day I intend to have my money... and I won't mind having to pay a bunch of taxes on it. \n \n Most people with a bag of money make it off of their investments. So those taxes can be kept low and people will still be able to invest. \n \n Other than that... hello Mr. Vice President. Otherwise I'll see you in Iowa. :)\n \n Politics is something I have considered... maybe later in life when I'm 40 and have the money to run around the country for a year or two without working. It would be fun because I wouldn't care about being reelected... I'd want to do my agenda no matter what the political impact.\n \n But I guess that rules me out....",
