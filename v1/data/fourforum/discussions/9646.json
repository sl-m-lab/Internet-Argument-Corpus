The book did look at other cultures, but I was unable to understand why the Aryans might rate extensive mentions in a world history book which skims over centuries of cultures throughout the entire world.\n\n \n Uhhh I wouldn't expect to see that in anything other than a Nazi-era German history book.\n \n The distinction between libertarianism and free market anarchism is very slight, both groups want as small a government as possible. The anarchists believe this is no government at all, while the libertarians believe no government at all would lead to a much larger government, thus violating the \"small a government as possible\" scheme.\n \n Libertarians believe that a government which preserves \"Life, liberty and property\" and does nothing else is worthwhile and tolerable, but what anarchists wish to stress is that for such a government to remain a government for long, it must have a 4th role, \"preventing any other authority from rising to power\". This is largely where even a minimal government's interests come into conflict with that of its citizens, it is charged with protecting them, but then turns against them to protect itself from potential challengers to its rule. To have the power to fight such battles, it requires resources far in excess of those required to perform its primary functions - it must not only have the physical power (armies) to fight potential wars, it must make its citizens sufficiently dependent on it that they believe it is absolutely essential to them. \n \n To take an extreme example, in Soviet Russia, the production of shoes, their specified sizes and makes, was controlled by a central government, and many Russians had no conception of the possibility of shoe manufacture without such specification, they believed that the consequence of this would be \"chaos\" of shoe manufacture, an inappropriate distribution of size availability. Clearly we in the western world know better, in the absence of a centrally planned shoe industry there are an abundance of shoes available in all sizes, with the popularity of a particular size determining the volume of its manufacture. But we may still believe that certain things are necessarily centrally planned, for example roads, railways, health care, the post office.... even most libertarians believe that this central planning is essential for the military and police.\n \n But I wonder whether this belief is simply something we have been conditioned to accept through our experience, perhaps there's no need for the government to do anything at all.",
