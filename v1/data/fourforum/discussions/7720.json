   "Daewoo got me onto this - I was never before aware of the deal with the Saudis (and hence OPEC) made by Nixon to only denominate oil for dollars - the \"petrodollar\" scheme. It completely explains US Middle East policy for the past thirty years, and yet I, an avid news-guzzler never stumbled on any information realated to this issue until I went looking for it. Maybe that's because I don't read the business section of papers, but surely this is an important enough issue that it should be part of the public consciousness, and should be one of the factors that underlies any discussion about the Middle East.\n This article explores the issue of the Iranian oil bourse clearly and concisely:\n \n Iran's Oil Exchange threatens the Greenback \n \n \nThe Bush administration will never allow the Iranian government to open an oil exchange (bourse) that trades petroleum in euros. If that were to happen, hundreds of billions of dollars would come flooding back to the United States crushing the greenback and destroying the economy. This is why Bush and Co. are planning to lead the nation to war against Iran. It is straightforward defense of the current global system and the continuing dominance of the reserve currency, the dollar.\n \n The claim that Iran is developing nuclear weapons is a mere pretext for war. The NIE (National Intelligence Estimate) predicts that Iran will not be able to produce nukes for perhaps a decade. So too, IAEA chief Mohammed ElBaradei has said repeatedly that his watchdog agency has found \"no evidence\" of a nuclear weapons program.\n \n There are no nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons programs, but Iran's economic plans do pose an existential threat to America, and not one that can be simply brushed aside as the unavoidable workings of the free market.\n \n America monopolizes the oil trade. Oil is denominated in dollars and sold on either the NYMEX or London's International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), both owned by Americans. This forces the central banks around the world to maintain huge stockpiles of dollars even though the greenback is currently underwritten by $8 trillion of debt and even though the Bush administration has said that it will perpetuate the deficit-producing tax cuts.\n \n America's currency monopoly is the perfect pyramid-scheme. As long as nations are forced to buy oil in dollars, the United States can continue its profligate spending with impunity. (The dollar now accounts for 68% of global currency reserves up from 51% just a decade ago) The only threat to this strategy is the prospect of competition from an independent oil exchange; forcing the faltering dollar to go nose-to-nose with a more stable (debt-free) currency such as the euro. That would compel central banks to diversify their holdings, sending billions of dollars back to America and ensuring a devastating cycle of hyper-inflation.\n \n The effort to keep information about Iran's oil exchange out of the headlines has been extremely successful. A simple Google search shows that NONE of the major newspapers or networks has referred to the upcoming bourse. The media's aversion to controversial stories which serve the public interest has been evident in many other cases, too, like the fraudulent 2004 presidential elections, the Downing Street Memo, and the flattening of Falluja. Rather than inform, the media serves as a bullhorn for government policy; manipulating public opinion by reiterating the specious demagoguery of the Bush administration. As a result, few people have any idea of the gravity of the present threat facing the American economy.\n\n \n If the dollar collapses the administration will be forced to raise interest rates (deflation) or risk hyperinflation; either way, the economy will be dealt a near-fatal blow. The predictions are dire, and come from both ends of the political spectrum. Paul Volcker, Professor Emeritus of International Economic Policy at Princeton University and former Chairman of the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System believes there is a \"75% chance of a dollar crash in the next 5 years\". \n \n \n Now we can understand why the corporate-friendly media has omitted any mention of new oil exchange in their coverage. This is one secret that the boardroom kingpins would rather keep to themselves. It's easier to convince the public of nuclear hobgoblins and Islamic fanatics than to justify fighting a war for the anemic greenback. Never the less, it is the dollar we are defending in Iraq and, presumably, in Iran as well in the very near future. (Saddam converted to the euro in 2000. The bombing began in 2001)\n \n There are peaceful solutions to this dilemma, but not if the Bush administration insists on hiding behind the moronic deception of terrorism or imaginary nuclear weapons programs. Bush needs to come clean with the American people about the real nature of the global energy crisis and stop invoking Bin Laden and WMD to defend American aggression. We need a comprehensive energy strategy, (including government funding for conservation projects, alternative energy-sources, and the development of a new line of \"American-made\" hybrid vehicles) candid negotiations with Iran to regulate the amount of oil they will sell in euros per year (easing away from the dollar in an orderly way) and a collective \"international\" approach to energy consumption and distribution (under the auspices of the UN General Assembly).\n\n \n This is extremely serious; if the US economy disintegrates it will affect the entire world. The US' dilemma is that it cannot allow a sudden conversion to a petro-euro or -yuan, but its current (and standard) militaristic methods only serve to destabilise the very region upon whose stability the world economy rests. \n \n The US has been able to practice gunboat diplomacy for decades but this is one situation the administration cannot threaten its way out of. Hard as it is to really believe, Iran (and others who might follow, Venezuela comes to mind) has the upper hand, and it enrages me that it seems to be nothing but arrogance on the part of the administration/Pentagon in perpetuating policies which are outdated, ineffective and, more importantly, dangerous, not just to those in areas of conflict but to the US itself, and not least the rest of the world.",

   "Gladly. Here are some other articles and essays I found just by googling \"Iran Oil Bourse\":\n \n The Real Reasons Why Iran is the Next Target\n \n \nOne of the Federal Reserve's nightmares may begin to unfold in 2005 or 2006, when it appears international buyers will have a choice of buying a barrel of oil for $50 dollars on the NYMEX and IPE - or purchase a barrel of oil for \u008037 - \u008040 euros via the Iranian Bourse. This assumes the euro maintains its current 20-25% appreciated value relative to the dollar - and assumes that some sort of \"intervention\" is not undertaken against Iran. The upcoming bourse will introduce petrodollar versus petroeuro currency hedging, and fundamentally new dynamics to the biggest market in the world - global oil and gas trades\n \n During an important speech in April 2002, Mr. Javad Yarjani, an OPEC executive, described three pivotal events that would facilitate an OPEC transition to euros. [10] He stated this would be based on (1) if and when Norway's Brent crude is re-dominated in euros, (2) if and when the U.K. adopts the euro, and (3) whether or not the euro gains parity valuation relative to the dollar, and the EU's proposed expansion plans were successful. (Note: Both of the later two criteria have transpired: the euro's valuation has been above the dollar since late 2002, and the euro-based E.U. enlarged in May 2004 from 12 to 22 countries). In the meantime, the United Kingdom remains uncomfortably juxtaposed between the financial interests of the U.S. banking nexus (New York/Washington) and the E.U. financial centers (Paris/Frankfurt).\n \n The implementation of the proposed Iranian oil Bourse (exchange) in 2005/2006 - if successful in utilizing the euro as its oil transaction currency standard - essentially negates the necessity of the previous two criteria as described by Mr. Yarjani regarding the solidification of a \"petroeuro\" system for international oil trades. [10] It should also be noted that during 2003-2004 Russia and China have both increased their central bank holdings of the euro currency, which appears to be a coordinated move to facilitate the anticipated ascendance of the euro as a second World Reserve currency. [11] [12] In the meantime, the United Kingdom is uncomfortable juxtaposed between the financial interests of the U.S. (New York/Washington) banking nexus and that of the E.U. financial center (Paris/Frankfurt).\n\n \n \n Oil bourse closer to reality\n \n \nIran announced in September [2004] its petroleum exchange will become operational by March 2006.\n\n \n The Proposed Iranian Oil Bourse\n \n \nEconomically, the American Empire was born with Bretton Woods in 1945. The U.S. dollar was not fully convertible to gold, but was made convertible to gold only to foreign governments. This established the dollar as the reserve currency of the world. It was possible, because during WWII, the United States had supplied its allies with provisions, demanding gold as payment, thus accumulating significant portion of the world's gold. An Empire would not have been possible if, following the Bretton Woods arrangement, the dollar supply was kept limited and within the availability of gold, so as to fully exchange back dollars for gold. However, the guns-and-butter policy of the 1960's was an imperial one: the dollar supply was relentlessly increased to finance Vietnam and LBJ's Great Society. Most of those dollars were handed over to foreigners in exchange for economic goods, without the prospect of buying them back at the same value. The increase in dollar holdings of foreigners via persistent U.S. trade deficits was tantamount to a tax-the classical inflation tax that a country imposes on its own citizens, this time around an inflation tax that U.S. imposed on rest of the world.\n \n When in 1970-1971 foreigners demanded payment for their dollars in gold, The U.S. Government defaulted on its payment on August 15, 1971. While the popular spin told the story of \"severing the link between the dollar and gold\", in reality the denial to pay back in gold was an act of bankruptcy by the U.S. Government. Essentially, the U.S. declared itself an Empire. It had extracted an enormous amount of economic goods from the rest of the world, with no intention or ability to return those goods, and the world was powerless to respond- the world was taxed and it could not do anything about it.\n \n From that point on, to sustain the American Empire and to continue to tax the rest of the world, the United States had to force the world to continue to accept ever-depreciating dollars in exchange for economic goods and to have the world hold more and more of those depreciating dollars. It had to give the world an economic reason to hold them, and that reason was oil.\n \n In 1971, as it became clearer and clearer that the U.S Government would not be able to buy back its dollars in gold, it made in 1972-73 an iron-clad arrangement with Saudi Arabia to support the power of the House of Saud in exchange for accepting only U.S. dollars for its oil. The rest of OPEC was to follow suit and also accept only dollars. Because the world had to buy oil from the Arab oil countries, it had the reason to hold dollars as payment for oil. Because the world needed ever increasing quantities of oil at ever increasing oil prices, the world's demand for dollars could only increase. Even though dollars could no longer be exchanged for gold, they were now exchangeable for oil.\n\n \n \n Iran to take control of world's oil trade in 2005\n \n \nThe Tehran bourse is considered to be more likely to succeed because Iran exports 2.7m barrels a day and produces 13m tonnes of petrochemicals every year. The country has the second biggest oil reserves in the world behind Saudi Arabia.\n\n \n \n Iran - a threat to the petrodollar?\n \n \nIt is primarily the US which stands to lose out from any move away from the petrodollar status quo, it is the world's largest importer of oil and a move away from invoicing oil in dollars to euros will undoubtedly have a negative effect on its economy.\n Fewer nations would be willing to hold the dollar in reserve which would cause a significant devaluation and result in the loss seigniorage revenues. In addition, US energy-related companies stand to lose out as they will be unable to participate in the bourse due to the longstanding American trade embargo on Iran.\n\n \n The Iranian Threat: The Bomb or the Euro? \n \n \nIn its economical war Iran is treading the same path Saddam Hussein had started when he, in 2000, converted all his reserve from the Dollar to the Euro, and demanded payments in Euro for Iraqi oil. Many economists then mocked Saddam because he had lost a lot of money in this conversion. Yet they were very surprised when he recuperated his losses within less than a year period due to the valuation of the Euro. The American administration became aware of the threat when central banks of many countries started keeping Euros along side of Dollars as their monetary reserve and as an exchange fund for oil (Russian and Chinese central banks in 2003). To avoid economical collapse the Bush administration hastened to invade and to destroy Iraq under false excuses to make it an example to any country who may contemplate dropping the Dollar, and to manipulate OPEC's decisions by controlling the second largest oil resource. Iraqi oil sale was reverted back to the petrodollar standard.\n\n \n Petrodollar Warfare: Dollars, Euros and the Upcoming Iranian Oil Bourse\n \n \nThe Pentagon, acting under instructions from Vice President Dick Cheney's office, has tasked the United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM) with drawing up a contingency plan to be employed in response to another 9/11-type terrorist attack on the United States. The plan includes a large-scale air assault on Iran employing both conventional and tactical nuclear weapons. Within Iran there are more than 450 major strategic targets, including numerous suspected nuclear-weapons-program development sites. Many of the targets are hardened or are deep underground and could not be taken out by conventional weapons, hence the nuclear option. As in the case of Iraq, the response is not conditional on Iran actually being involved in the act of terrorism directed against the United States. Several senior Air Force officers involved in the planning are reportedly appalled at the implications of what they are doing - that Iran is being set up for an unprovoked nuclear attack - but no one is prepared to damage his career by posing any objections.\n",

Maybe that's because I don't read the business section of papers, but surely this is an important enough issue that it should be part of the public consciousness, and should be one of the factors that underlies any discussion about the Middle East.\n\n \n Don't feel too bad about missing that one. This has been kept strictly out of the media. I originally found out about it becuase I speak a little arabic. I had a HARD time picking it up, so I watch ME sattelite TV pretty regularly to try to stay at last sharp enough in it to get by. So, I am sitting there about 2 years ago watching some channel out of Jordan and they are talking about how the Iranians plans for the oil bourse are going. You could have knocked me over with a feather. It was the first I had heard of it, despite the fact that I follow economic issues pretty closely and the Iranians had been putting the plan together for years. \n \n I figured that it would be all over the US news, and it was fully a year later that I saw anythign at all about it. That should have been the biggest story in the economic world. The opening of the Iranian oil bourse has the potential to change the world as or more drastically than the use of nuclear weapons on Japan. This is something that could completely shift the balance of power on the planet earth. And the media says NOTHING.\n \n \n \n \nIf the dollar collapses the administration will be forced to raise interest rates (deflation) or risk hyperinflation; either way, the economy will be dealt a near-fatal blow. The predictions are dire, and come from both ends of the political spectrum. Paul Volcker, Professor Emeritus of International Economic Policy at Princeton University and former Chairman of the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System believes there is a \"75% chance of a dollar crash in the next 5 years\". \n\n \n Volker is worth listening to. He is almost always right. There were many who were critical of his policies when he was with the fed, but history has vindicated him nicely. Volker is sharp and tends to pick up things that some other people miss. \n \n People just don't pay attention. For example, why is the fed raising interest rates? 90% of people will tell you right off the bat \"to control inflation\". Sorry. Welcome to the real world. The feds current policies are NOT anti inflationary. How can that be? They are raising interest rates? Yes...theya re raising interest rates, but moneterizing long term debt on the back side. They are essentially putting up little 1/4 point interest rate increases, and passing it off as inflation fighting, and an indicator of a healthy economy, while running the printing presses full speed. \n \n It is things like this, and things like the Iranian oil bourse, that make guys like Volker sit up and voice predictions like that. The informaiton is out there, people just either don't understand how to apply it, or don't care enough to dig it up. did you know that if unemplyment was calcualted the same way today that it was during the depression, our unemployment rate is nearly 14%...or that if we calculated inflation today the same way we did during the Carter administration, it is over 10%? Our strong economy is all smoke and mirrors and numbers tricks.\n \n \nThis is extremely serious; if the US economy disintegrates it will affect the entire world. The US' dilemma is that it cannot allow a sudden conversion to a petro-euro or -yuan, but its current (and standard) militaristic methods only serve to destabilise the very region upon whose stability the world economy rests. \n\n \n True enough. BUT, the situation woudl not be so dire as many seem to believe. It would certainly lead to worldwide economic problems, but they are likely to be temporary. With China coming online as the worlds biggest consumer economy, and S America and the ME in a postion to become relatively stable supplies of cheap labor, the world will adapt and move on. With the steep decline in oil dmeand that would come with an economic crash in the united states, and the probable decrease in oil prices that would accompany that fall in demand, large portions of the world may be better off without us. The hardest hit would be the western powers, Europe and certainly the UK, who rely on the US to keep the world power base centered in the west.",

Also, if you tried to open the case incorrectly, the result would be the same. \n \n Often, according to ops, these guys could not let the cases out of their sight, and they would be handcuffed to the guy. This leads to problems if he has to go to the bathroom or to lunch. They would have somebody from special security services watch the guy all the time. 24 horus per day, 7 days a week. My job was not to watch the guy. My job, when I was on loan, was to watch the guy who was watching the guy. I am NOT kidding. That is why I ended up doing it. If you are the guy who is watching the guy, you can not have ever had any contact with the guy. My unit was completely isolated from the rest of the base, so there was no chance I would know the guy who was watchign the guy. \n \n These were not nuclear secrets...just ops stuff. And we are expected to believe that the Iranians...the folks who managed to keep their nuclear program secret for 18 years, have people walking around with nuclear secrets on LAPTOPS?",

   "I am going to be traveling for a few days, so my responses may not be timely, but I will try to get back here dependant on internet availability and other commitments.\n \n How much bigger is M3 than M2? How long is a piece of string? \n \n Between 1995 and 2005, M1 grew roughly 18.8%. M2 grew roughly 89.5%. M3, on the other hand, grew 130%. \n \n This is something that is difficult to simplify, and I may not do a good job. George, check me on this and make sure I don't oversimplify.\n \n \n Money supply and liquidity are essentially the same thing form a finacial standpoint. If you take a billion dollars and buy a billion dollars worth of bonds, that billion dollars has transferred to the government. You now have a billion dollars worth of bonds, but you no longer have your billion dollars. \n \n Now, you can take that billion dollars worth of bonds and sell it, in which case you have a billion dollars, but you no longer have the billion dollars worth of bonds. OR, you can doa sales and repurchase agreement, which means you agree to sell the bonds, and then buy them back later, in shihc case you still never have the billion dollars and the bonds at the same time, and when you do not have the bonds, you have somebody elses billion dollars.\n \n If you are a bank, however, especially the central bank, there is a neat trick you can play. If you are a bank, you can take that bond and do a sale and repurchase deal with the federal reserve. You sell your billion dollars worth of bonds to the federal reserve, and they give you your billion dollars. The trick to this is that the federal reserve doe snot have to have the billion dollars. They create that billion dollars. Then you take that billion dollars, which is cash, and you loan out 900 million of it. Say that 900 million all comes back as deposits (because that money goes somewhere, and for the sake of simplicity, we wills ay it all goes back to the same bank) So, that 900 million ocmes back, and you can loan it back out, and the reserve requirement is 10%, so you can loan out another $810 million. Say that comes back as depostis, you can loan out ANOTHER $729 million. This goes on until you only have $10, and you can loan out 9 of that.\n \n Now, due to frational reserves, that 1 billion that you swapped the fed for those bonds has become 9 billion. you are collecctign interest and principal on that 9 billion. Finally, the time comes to buy back your bonds. You give the fed back their billion dollars, they give you back your bonds. So, now you have the billion dollars, plus 8 billion in accounts payable, AND the fed has the billion dollars that they created! Your 1 billion dollars in bonds has become 10 billion dollars, PLUS, the government still has the billion dollar you gave them for the bonds in the first place. \n \n Basically what it boikls down to is that M3 shows back side moneterization of debt, almost exclusively government bonds. \n \n There is another neat trick that gets played when it comes to M3. Lets say that the government does not sell out a bond offering and needs the cash. THEY can deposit their OWN savings bonds and the fed will directly monetize them. \n \n While M1 and M2 are primarily priuate sector funds, money that you and I and the business down the street are holding, M3 is M2 plus institutional money...it is what the big boys are doing. \n \n As far as the conspiracy comment goes, I think this is very clearly an attempt to hide the moneterization of debt, adn thus hide massiv increases in the money supply. I think this is part of a wider strategy. The fed has been raising interest rates, but M3 has been growing wildly, which means that while they raise interest rates they are printing money like crazy, so they are fighting inflation in public while fueling the fire on the back side. \n \n More later",
