   "Generally I am loathe to warn folks away from seeing a movie but I will do so on this occasion. Ben Witherington speaks about this movie in a recent blog and warns parents to avoid letting their kids see the movie. Witherington is quite the movie buff and is no theatrical prude as are some Christians. The books the movie is taken from are very anti-religious and written by an atheist. Here's a link that explains it in a little more detail:\n http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/compass.asp\n \n \n \nThe media have played happily along in disguising Pullman's religion-bashing. On NBC's \"Today,\" weatherman Al Roker delighted in making \"The Golden Compass\" the fall book selection of \"Al's Book Club for Kids.\" Pullman appeared on NBC to deny that he was really promoting atheism. He touted letting the reader decide what the author intended, in a \"democracy of reading.\" The closest he came to atheism was saying the book championed \"open-minded intellectual curiosity.\" If that sounds like a transparent dodge, it certainly was. He told the students asking questions to think of the Taliban in Afghanistan. But the menace in Pullman's trilogy isn't called the Caliphate, and its hideous monsters aren't mullahs. They are cardinals and priests, and the heroes are an atheist former nun and two rebellious gay male angels. \n The atheists may be angry that the movie waters down Pullman's anti-religious message, but they can take comfort in the fact that many parents (and grandparents and even godparents) will, sadly, buy the hype over this movie and buy this trilogy of vicious anti-religious books for the young readers in their lives. To the Christian book buyer, beware: Instead of celebrating God's son born in the flesh, you'll be celebrating God being killed so that man can advance to true consciousness.\n\n \n Here is more: http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=58341\n \nThe world of Pullman's series mechanically mirrors that of C.S. Lewis. While \"The Chronicles Of Narnia\" starts with Lucy going into the wardrobe to get to Narnia, Pullman has Lyra going into a wardrobe. But, what Lyra finds is not the supernatural world, nor a world where God rescues His creation, like Narnia, but rather a world that ends in dust, where the highest meaning can be found in pleasuring each other, and God is just a sniveling old man who doesn't know what he's doing. \n \n Pullman's world is a sad, animalistic universe. Since this is the only world there is, the trilogy ends in hopelessness. Love is not selfless giving, because that would be useless in a materialistic world. Love instead is the lust of pleasuring each other. In Pullman's world, there's no hope of eternal life where the lame and the blind and the deaf and dumb can walk and see and hear and talk, where the old are made youthful. There's no heavenly banquet, there's no loving God, there's no order, and there's no peace. \n \n The logical consequences of Pullman's atheism can be found in the lives of the leading atheists of the 20th century - Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot - men who killed millions of their own people and had no respect for justice or love. Ultimately, it is a road that only leads to meaninglessness and murder. \n \n \n\n \n Truly disturbing. Parents with a conscience will avoid this film.",

   "Perfect, thank you. \n Not much of a belief system if it is shattered by a movie.\n\n \n Hey, atheists have to have their cinematic day in the sun too, huh? emoticon_xangel \n \n I've been following this whole thing in the news with a bit of interest, and I have a few thoughts on it.\n \n For once, I agree with you, at least in terms of the concept you state here. Neither this movie, nor the novels it is based on, are a threat to Christianity. \n \n I will say this though. I read some comments of the author of the books, and he gave the impression they were more or less mostly geared as a reaction against the C.S. Lewis Chronicles of Narnia, which he HATED for some bizarre reason. The impression I got was that he had an 'axe to grind' with the whole thing, and I'm just not interested in reading literature with those kind of negative motivations, typically. It sort of harkens to the whole current agressive-atheism movement going on a la Rev. Dawkins and Rev. Hitchens, the two Atheist patriarchs these days. (Though as I'll say below, I'll probably see the film at some point.)\n \n While there's nothing more wrong with atheist-message allegory than there is with Christian allegory, there's also nothing wrong with people bringing to light what it's really about--that it's NOT just an adventure movie, but one with an agenda of sorts. People are free to draw their own conclusions about God and atheism, but they also have every right to know what these books are really about. I wouldn't be one to discourage people from seeing it or reading them, but I'd certainly \"warn\" them ahead of time what they're really getting into, just so they have the real picture of the situation rather than just an agenda-less novel (which it's not). For some that would be attractive, for others not. Nevertheless knowledge of the real situation is better than not knowing. Give people the truth and let them draw their conclusions. I'd say the same in terms of \"warning\" people of Lewis' motivations of Christianity in the Chronicles of Narnia.\n \n One things' for certain--good or bad, it pretty much exposes as a canard the idea that some atheists aren't out for some agenda of their own.\n \n I'll probably see it when it comes out on DVD, just because it might be a good adventure film. I certainly have no problem looking past whatever agenda-based elements that are there, just for the sake of a good story. I certainly have no fear of any atheist message that might be there, and I'm sure it wouldn't be anything I haven't heard or considered before, along those lines.\n \n In regards to the 'letter' electrolyte pasted, I think it's an over-reaction as well. It portrays religious \"authority\" (of which there really isn't much of these days anyway) only in light of the most hard-to-swallow Old Testament references, completely ignoring the plethora of other more loving elements of the Bible, such as Christ Himself (the founder of the religion, of all people!). And it sets up a false dichotomy by pitting religious authority against \"reason and love\", as if the two aren't also hand-in-hand at times as well. I can only hope it instead gives a balanced picture of religious authority, but even reviews that are favorable and agreeing toward the books indicate that it probably doesn't. So chances are, the books will probably paint a pretty unfair assessment, unfortunately.\n \n One other thought: I'm glad to see this in the 'entertainment' forum rather than the religion forum, for some reason.",

I can't \"come out\" as a non-Christian for fear of retaliation, ostracism, and firing.\n At my workplace, a person emailed all personnel with an ALL CAPS plea not to see this movie because the books \"start out innocent\" but are really a backhanded, sneaky attempt at promoting the killing of God. Tell me: How in the hell can these people who believe that God is eternal and omnipotent think that a movie that has children killing God has any link whatsoever to reality?\n People here make their decisions first based on what they think their religion allows, then by anything reasonable. I once had a student who told me that she didn't believe in evolution because she was a Christian. Yes, that was her reason. She had no reason, she just \"knew\" that she didn't believe in it because her father told her that Christians don't. As a theistic evolutionist, you can see the fallacy in this, but it's the norm here.\n I haven't read the book, so I don't know what it really says, but is it possible that it's not creating a false dichotomy but instead simply exposing that these things (religion and reason/love) are not linked by necessity, as is often argued by religious zealots?\n Phil's letter is spot on: The movie is about rejecting false authority like those in some churches, and the church is exercising its authority to prevent people from seeing the movie.

Though church opposition can't be discounted, he says, \"to claim it's a victim of religious controversy, there's no real evidence of that, at least not at this point.\"\n \n The film may have suffered from a general tiring of fantasy films, he says. He noted the poor box-office performance of Stardust, which topped out at just $38.3 million this year. \"And while the movie has been treated as a potential franchise, a la Lord of the Rings, in some ways, it was never fated to be like that,\" Kilday says. \"The Pullman trilogy isn't as well known, and this is a fantasy built around a young girl\" - not exactly a fit with the genre's core young-male audience.\n \n What's more, he says, \"in reaching out to younger females, it obviously ran up against Enchanted.\"\n \n Disney's princess film, in fact, is holding well, according to studio estimates from Nielsen EDI. The film captured No. 2 with $10.7 million after two weeks at No. 1. \n\n \n It seemed to me that some folks lined up as Atheists or Christians and took sides hoping the film would fly or flop.

But on the flipside, the Golden Compass literature DOES portray the church (Magisterium) and God as the villain. One has a definitive agenda AGAINST something, the others do not. I think that's what the real rub tends to be. I think people would have no problem at all if the Compass series were simply a secular-type work, but it clearly goes beyond that. It does have an agenda against religion. You may agree with that agenda, or not, but it cannot really be denied that it does. (Heck, the author makes no bones about it in interviews!) The Chronicles of Narnia, works of Tolkein, well as the Passion movie as \"religious works\" are not making a villain out atheism, but this \"atheism work\" (for lack of a better term) of Philip Pullman DOES make a villain out of religion. With that said, I have no problem with Pullman putting this series out. It's no threat to religion. So I don't say any of this to criticise Pullman, but simply to point out that there is a difference. For my own reading and preferences, I PREFER literature without such propagandist theme against something, but it is what it is, and Pullman can publish whatever he darn well wants to.",

   "Really jyoshu?\n Can you explain HOW the Golden Compass portrays Christianity or any specific religion as \"villainy\"?\n\n \n I didn't say it specified Christianity, or any one given religion.

It doesn't change the point that the Golden Compass literature does have an agenda and makes religion out as the antagonist. Surely you aren't saying you actually disagree with this.\n \n \nOh dear god this is absurd.\n It no more portrays THE \"church\" as a villain than a James Bond flick with a white male villain portrays THE \"white male\" as a villain.\n It shows A dogmatic example of religion being a villain.\n\n \n Geez, Foundit, Settle down. There's no need to be knee jerk about it. But let's see .... the whole thing ultimately (by the 3rd book) turns into a quest to kill God. And the God in the story to be killed is referred to as \"yahweh\". No making God out as an antagonist THERE! Of course not!! Absolutely not ... emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nAnybody who derives a generic conclusion based on that is being inane and ridiculous. It would be more accurate to say that A fictional church with specific actions was a villain. And the parallel would be that any MODERN church DOING THE SAME ACTIONS would be possibly perceived as \"a villain\". To jump from \"they showed a religion as a villain, ergo they show the GENERAL ISSUE as villain\" is inane.

But the books involve God being the antagonist, who has angels, and an organization that's conveniently similar to the organised church. That much is well-known common knowledge. No I haven't read them or seen the movie (and I'm not just talking about the movie here). Nothing I have stated here requires anything beyond common knowledge about the Dark Materials series, so please don't pull the tired old tactic of saying that one can't have an opinion here without having read it. And frankly, I doubt you're read the Dark Materials series either. For anything I've statedhere, there's enough common knowledge from balanced and objective sources to go on. I've never gotten around to actually reading the whole story of \"Moby Dick\" either but I know what happens in the book and themes of the book because of common knowledge about it. I have read Pullman's interviews about his own literature. I don't think I'm going out on a limb here at all. I also don't think there's anything wrong with what Pullman is doing in his writing. But goodness, how you can talk of literature that speaks of killing God, making Him out as the antagonist, and associating bad things with Him as not being an agenda (at least in terms of social commentary) of sorts concerning the church today and God is beyond me. Sheesh, authors don't write in a vacuum, and this one's a rather outspoken atheist in the aggressive bent of Hitchens and Dawkins.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n P.S. ... how many of the approx eleven questions you've posited in this last post of yours are rhetorical and how many are you expecting to be answered?

(Since you've latched onto that and ignored the other examples I gave you.)\n\n Wow. Isn't that convenient.\n Once again we ignore the reality of the HYPOCRISY and DIFFERENT TREATMENT when it comes to some in Christianity doing something, and another religion doing something.\n What you're trying to pull now is like Jack criticizing his Jill for speeding. Jill points out that Jack doesn't follow his own rule and was busted for a speeding ticket on one day.\n And then Jack insists that Jill should ignore that day and look at another day he didn't get a ticket on.\n \n I'm sorry, but no. Passion cannot be taken \"out of the equation\", cause it shows how some in Christianity abuse the VERY THINGS they try to complain about when they aren't the ones perpetrating it.\n \n \n \nIt doesn't change the point that the Golden Compass literature does have an agenda and makes religion out as the antagonist. Surely you aren't saying you actually disagree with this.\n\n Yes. Very much so.\n As already explained, it shows a FICTIONAL RELIGION as an antagonist.\n \n To proclaim that means religion IN GENERAL is an antagonist is absurd.\n By such an example, ANY movie that shows A religion in a negative light can be claimed as an attack on the SUBJECT of religion, which is absurd.\n \n \n \nGeez, Foundit, Settle down. There's no need to be knee jerk about it.\n\n Funny. That's exactly how I see your approach as coming off.\n \n \n \nBut let's see .... the whole thing ultimately (by the 3rd book) turns into a quest to kill God. And the God in the story to be killed is referred to as \"yahweh\".\n\n Substantiate your claim.\n Rumor is rumor. \"Common\" knowledge is often nothing of the sort.\n \"common\" knowledge is often code for \"people talking about a subject they have no knowledge or substantiation for, but want to claim unjustified authority for.\n In The Amber Spyglass, Pullman has the Authority unmasked as a decrepit and immoral fraud who had been posing as Supreme Being, and who in the end suffers an ignomious death and dissipation into the wind.Great \"god\" figure, huh...\n Cause again, it boils down to an issue with the APPROACH that some dogmas take with regards to totalitarian power.\n Quite frankly, in how the Bible ACTUALLY plays out in my interpretation, it's apples and oranges. A bit like trying to criticize Ghandi with a fictional character that actually resembles Hitler.\n \n \n \nI'm not saying there aren't general themes. But the books involve God being the antagonist...\n\n Again, substantiation please.\n What I have seen is that PEOPLE are the antagonists.\n \n \n \nI've never gotten around to actually reading the whole story of \"Moby Dick\" either but I know what happens in the book and themes of the book because of common knowledge about it.\n\n Quite frankly, if \"Moby Dick\" had a zealotted \"religious\" opposition to it, then you would have a comparison.\n With \"Golden Compass\", we have a situation where people who have NEVER READ it are making claims against it, based on proclaimed \"common knowledge\".\n And we can dredge up quite enough examples of how the more zealotted members of religion can lie and misrepresent things to their own end.\n \n \n \nBut goodness, how you can talk of literature that speaks of killing God, making Him out as the antagonist, and associating bad things with Him as not being an agenda (at least in terms of social commentary) of sorts concerning the church today and God is beyond me.\n\n Quite frankly, I'm amused in thinking that your approach to this whole thing is very muslim in its extremity.\n You cannot handle a FICTIONAL representation of \"God\" because you so closely CLAIM EXCLUSIVE representation of him that you take offense at anybody else's FICTIONAL representation.\n \n The \"god\" in the FICTION book is NOT your god.\n It is not intelligent to derive ANY conclusion about a FICTIONAL god's actions, as compared to YOUR religion when there are SOOOOO many differences.\n \n \n \nP.S. ... how many of the approx eleven questions you've posited in this last post of yours are rhetorical and how many are you expecting to be answered? \n\n P.S. How many times did I criticize you in that post for not addressing a question?\n Don't try to continue with this boring attempt to pretend that your frequent attempts to DODGE ISSUES can be blamed on me using the question mark more times than you would like.\n You proved my point in that previous post where you dodged VIRTUALLY ALL of the questions and concentrated SOLELY on complaining about them. That tactic is a boring attempt to side-track the issue, and I can easily switch back to removing the question mark from my posts to prove your avoidance techniques if necessary.\n The point is that you often ignore not JUST the question, but rather the ENTIRE ISSUE that the question is about.\n Over and over again you throw out banal complaints to try to defuse the topical discussion.

Christianity has no monopoly on human trials and tribulations.\n \n Pullman's attitude towards god is not one I really share. He almost seems resentful, as though god were real and guilty of major betrayal. I just think the whole god thing is a human-created myth that reflects something about our psychology, not external reality.

Maybe I am just dense, but I never really saw the religous undertones there. If anything I would think that turning God into a talking lion would be viewed as blasphemous. \n \n \n \nI don't see why either side are getting so wrapped up. It's an movie. And an bad one at that. It will be forgotten in an few years. It is as if some groups in the culture war have completely lost perspective.\n\n \n I actually watched this movie to see what all the fuss was about. First of all, that is not really my genre, but I thought the movie sucked. After all the fanfair and the fairly reputable cast, I expected something WAY better. That movie just blew. The ending was a setup for a sequal that I hope to god they never make.\n \n I did not necessarily see a lot of anti religous undertones there so much as anti fascist undertones. If anything I suppose you could view it as anti religous extremism.\n \n On a somewhat related not, I thought the lion the witch and the wardrobe sucked, too. The acting was absolutly horrible and they could not have picked worse kids for the roles if they tried. Susan was OK, and Edmund was not entirely horrible, but frankly it would have been better if lucy and peter had died in the first 2 mintues and then they improvised from there and scrapped the whole story rather than subjecting us to 2 hours of their terrible \"acting\".\n \n I also can't help but wonder if the folks who made that bothered reading the book...or any of the other narnia books...or did they jsut read the cliff notes and call it good??? Whle the general story line was there, they managed to completely fail to capture the spirit of the books at all. Very dissapointing.\n \n Also, on an even further side note, I watched Stardust with my 5 yr old last night. Like I said, not really my genre, but stardust was pretty good. It was original, the acting was pretty good, and somebody actually put some effort into it...unlike the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe or The golden compass. \n \n Usually when I watch movies with the kids I read a book while they watch. Stardust was actually good enough to be worth putting down the book and paying attention. Little advanced for the really young kids (my 3 yr old was totally uninterested) but good for the 5 yr old and worth watching even for daddy.",

I guess what kind of made me discount the religous overtones was the heavy reliance on magic which, according to my roman catholic upbringing, is satanic regardless of intent or ultimate consequences. For example, Aslan came back to life due to a older magical rule that the white witch did not know. God (at least the god I was raised to belive in) is omnipotent and all powerful.

   "Yea...the credits rolled and you kind of go....HUH??? Did they just runoutof film at that point??\n\n \n Basically. I feel the whole magic-epic genre is trying to capitalize in on Potter and Frodo and failing to do so. The water horse bombed in theaters, prince caspian looks unappealing...they need to give that genre an rest, comics as well aside from Iron man. That movie looks decent. Everyone likes an hero who has serious problems and Tony Stark is the poster child of that view. \n \n \nPeople need to lighten up. I don't see any way that the movie in question is dangerous. Oh, and letting your kids watch harry potter is not going to turn them into satan worshipers.\n\n \n Well dangerous to the future careers of its actors maybe...hhahaha. People do need to lighten up. There's an quote from the Sci-Fi Series \"stargate:\"\n \n \nWhatever problems there are between your planet's nations, they will seem insignificant when you do find out what's going on out there.\n\n \n The culture wars have completely lost perspective.\n \n \nI agree....except that in the last movie ol' frodo could have done a little more acting and a little less melodramatic ####.
