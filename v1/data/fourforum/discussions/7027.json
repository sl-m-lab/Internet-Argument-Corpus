Except for maybe a few exceptions, using the judiciary for this sort of thing is a relatively new thing in American history. Civil rights issues have mostly been dealt with by amendment and legislation in this country, not by finding loopholes in law and subjective interpretation by individual or a few judges. But gay lobbyists know that the judiciary is the only way they have to do it, because it's the most subjective part of our process. Subjectivism and eye-of-the-beholder-interpretation is crucial for much of gay rights.\n \n I also agree that I don't see how anyone, unless he has a very limited understanding of U.S. govt. civics and process, can say that the people don't ultimately make law through elections.

Voting! Imagine that, in a country by the people and for the people.\n \n\n \n First, jyoshu is commenting on a direct quote from the article cited. Second, it turns out in this case that the people of Wisconsin do get to vote directly to establish a law here. Consider the amendment provision in the Wisconsin state Constitution:\n \n \nConstitutional amendments. Section 1. Any amendment or amendments to this constitution may be proposed in either house of the legislature, and if the same shall be agreed to by a majority of the members elected to each of the two houses, such proposed amendment or amendments shall be entered on their journals, with the yeas and nays taken thereon, and referred to the legislature to be chosen at the next general election, and shall be published for three months previous to the time of holding such election; and if, in the legislature so next chosen, such proposed amendment or amendments shall be agreed to by a majority of all the members elected to each house, then it shall be the duty of the legislature to submit such proposed amendment or amendments to the people in such manner and at such time as the legislature shall prescribe; and if the people shall approve and ratify such amendment or amendments by a majority of the electors voting thereon, such amendment or amendments shall become part of the constitution; provided, that if more than one amendment be submitted, they shall be submitted in such manner that the people may vote for or against such amendments separately.\n\n \n So, the people of Wisconsin will vote directly on whether this amendment should pass or not.\n \n \nI cannot vote to change a federal law. The best I can do is, as you say, vote for someone who I hope will change a law in the way I want. An indirect method at best.\n\n An indirect method indeed. One that you seem to disaprove of. Yet, it is the method established in the constituion for legislative action. I don't mind that you think that to be an unfair way of establishing or changing laws, but if you don't like the way the constiution sets up the procedure, you should follow the prescribed way of changing the procedure, i.e, the amendment process.\n \n \nIf I want a pracitcal method for striking down a bad law, the courts are and always have been the direct, and constitutional, method of doing so.\n\n Except in the case of outlawing say, slavery, or in the case of, say, permitting women to vote. \n \n I think A is a bad law. I cannot convince a majority of the people to agree with me. So I will not be able to change the law. But, if i can get 5 judges to agree with me that A is a bad law, then the law will be changed.

This may not be the only means by which laws can change, but it would be a clear error to say that constiutional amendments don't change the law. \n \n \nThen why do you keep saying that can't?\n\n Because in light of your posts in this thread, I suspect that you and I differ on what a court may legitimately strike down. For instance, you have suggested that courts may legitimately strike down \"unjust\" or \"bad\" laws. I, on the other hand, think that the courts can only legitimately strike down laws that violate the constiution. It does not seem to me that because a law is \"bad,\" it is therefore unconstiutional, and it does not seem to me that because a law is \"unjust,\" it is therefore unconstitutional. And it is certainly not the case that the courts are the only means by which \"bad\" or \"unjust\" laws are changed, as you seem to think.\n \n \nEven if you could get a majority to agree, how would you change the law? Seriously, explain the procedure.\n\n I will first point out that, on its face, this is a moot point to the current discussion. The constitution sets up a way of governing. It establishes a procedure for enacting laws. We can question the effectiveness of this procedure all we want to, but so long as that procedure is in the constiution, it must be followed. We could of course repeal that part of the constiution if we so choose, but until we do, Article I prevails.\n \n An explanation of the procedure is quite simple: we vote for representatives. Those elected representatives vote for or against legislation based upon the opinion/interest of the people who elected them. If they make a mistake and enact something the people don't like, well, the people can show their disapproval by removing them.\n \n \nDo you really think that you're going to get a majority to vote for your candidate based on that one issue?\n\n You would get a majority to vote for a certain candadite based upon several issues. Elected representatives are to emody their constituent's opinion on issues. If one's opinion isn't the majority opinion, then they may exercise their first amendment right in order to try and make it the majority opinion. If that isn't sucessful, well then, it really is tough luck unless the majority is trampling on a constiutional right. And, as I've said, just because a minority view is not being enacted does not mean that the legislature has violated a constiutional right of that minority. \n \n \nDo you really think that's how laws are supposed to get changed?\n\n Yes. But, regardless of what I think, the constiution establishes that as the proper way to change a law unless the law is in violation of the constiution. I'm free not to like that. In fact, I'm so free to dislike that provsion that I can do my best to try and convince others that Article I is a piece of XXXX. But, until Article I is invalidated, it still stands.\n \n \nUS Constitution, Article 3, section 2:\n The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority\n \n The courts have authority over the laws of the United States. They're bound to follow constitutional guidelines when deciding on matters of the law, but they have the authority, granted by the constitution. If a law doesn't meet constitutional muster, the courts can kill it. Not only can they, they are duty bound to do so.\n\n I agree with this statement.

Many people feel that drug laws are bad laws but having marijuana illegal is not against the constitution. There is a huge difference. A judge is not supposed to decide what he, as an unelected official, feels is a good or bad law.

We don't have a dicatorship here pal. The legitmate way to change the law is via Congress or state legislature. A judge, another other things, is supposed to be a guardian of the constitution. So if someone makes an unconstitutional law then the are supposed to guard what the constitution says and what the constitution says can't be changed by the guards but by the elected officials only.

The only reason why they can say something is unconstitutional is because the constitution is a set of supreme laws. The only way to override one is to make a new amendment. So a normal law doesn't cut it. The only way the constitution changes is via the congress and states, not the courts. For example, the SCOTUS said that death penanlty for minors was constitutional back in that late 80s. REcently they said that it is UNconstitutional because times have changed(and not because the previous decision was wrong). This is rewritting the law and they do not have this power.",

   "I may be a bit late on this, but all this discussion about how to change laws reminded me of an interesting bit from Thoreau's Resistance to Civil Government, published in 1849:\n \n \nAll voting is a sort of gaming, like checkers or backgammon, with a slight moral tinge to it, a playing with right and wrong, with moral questions; and betting naturally accompanies it. The character of the voters is not staked. I cast my vote, perchance, as I think it right; but I am not vitally concerned that that right should prevail. I am willing to leave it to the majority. Its obligation, therefore, never exceeds that of expediency. Even voting for the right is doing nothing for it. It is only expressing to men feebly your desire that it should prevail. A wise man will not leave the right to the mercy of chance, nor wish it to prevail through the power of the majority. There is but little virtue in the action of masses of men.\n\n (emphasis mine)",
