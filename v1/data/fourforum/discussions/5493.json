   "I could probably have penned this but not as eloquently. Some who \"gets it.\" Evidently the Europeans are starting to \"get it.\" If they ever have a 9/11 on their soil, they will \"get it\" in spades.\n ===============================\n \n \n Garth George: Why Europe will self-destruct just like the Soviet Union\n \n 02.06.05\n \n Except for Newstalk ZB's morning host, Leighton Smith, I have never heard anyone predict the eventual disintegration of the European Union, and sooner rather than later.\n \n Yet for years I have held the opinion that this unwieldy collection of different nations cannot survive as an entity and that the more additional economic, social and political connections that are made, the less likely it is to survive.\n \n The resounding \"non\" in the referendum on the proposed EU constitution held in France this week is merely the first major breeze through the house-of-cards structure that is European \"unity\".\n \n And at the time of writing it is expected that the Dutch, fiercely protective of the sovereignty of their damp little patch of dirt, will follow suit.\n \n That the breach happened in France comes as no surprise, for the French are probably the most nationalistic, insular and xenophobic of all Europeans.\n \n The court action to suppress courtroom videotapes by the undercover Rainbow Warrior killers, Mafart and Prieur, is simply further evidence - although none is needed - of the selfishness and arrogance of this insufferable race.\n \n It would have been interesting if Germany had held a referendum instead of deciding the constitution issue in the Bundestag. But Gerhard Schroeder wasn't as silly as the doddering Jacques Chirac. He probably knew that a referendum would be doomed to failure in a country in which neo-Nazism flourishes mainly as a result of European Union racial liberalism.\n \n And I wonder, too, what the results might have been had Austria and Italy asked their populations to decide. Greece, too, with Turkey knocking on the EU's door.\n \n In Britain, which to its credit has remained more at arm's length from the EU than most, Tony Blair seems sure to think twice about the referendum planned for next year because there is nothing surer than that the Brits would deliver an even stronger \"no\" than the French.\n \n How anyone can believe that this assortment of nations can form such an intimate relationship and make it last is beyond me, although I'm sure it makes perfect sense to the post-modernist utopianists who devised it and built it.\n \n They seem to think that history can be ignored, that nationhood, race, ethnicity and culture developed and nurtured over thousands of years can suddenly be subsumed to a perceived \"good\".\n \n They seem to think that in this New Age of political correctness, ancient rivalries - often virulent hatreds - can be overcome and forgotten as if they had never happened. The whole of European history says bollocks to that.\n \n But, once again, the post-modernists hold sway, the multiculturalists who believe that all cultures are equivalent and thus can live together in harmony. World history says bollocks to that, too.\n \n But while we're on the subject of multiculturalism, let's take a look a little closer to home, because the attempt to weld together nations is simply an attempt to weld together vastly different ethnicities and cultures on a larger scale.\n \n And that's what we are trying to do down this end of the world in New Zealand and Australia. Jim Bolger, for all his Catholic upbringing, was an ardent post-modernist and multiculturalist and, of course, the fifth Labour Government (four too many, eh?) is loaded with such people.\n \n If we were to hold a referendum in this country this week on whether our immigration policy should continue as it is, the \"no\" votes would so outnumber the \"yes\" votes that we would be left in no doubt as to where most New Zealanders stand.\n \n The melding into one nation of such vastly disparate people - physically, mentally, spiritually and culturally - is a utopian dream held only by people who must be a long way out of touch with the realities of human nature.\n \n As the indefatigable multiculturalist Tapu Misa pointed in this space yesterday, cross-cultural marriages, even between Maori and Pakeha - people who have lived together for more than 200 years - rarely reach a degree of amity to be expected in settled relationships.\n \n If man and wife of different races can't come to terms with each other's differences after years of abiding in a state of ultimate intimacy, what chance is there for individuals and nations?\n \n We see already the refusal of many of our immigrants to integrate by the settlement by race of a number of areas in the suburbs of greater Auckland, by the proliferation of businesses carrying only incomprehensible signs, and by the outbreak of crimes once almost unknown here.\n \n Why have these things been done - the attempts to make Western Europe's disparate nations into one amorphous country, and the attempts to integrate disparate races into one New Zealand? It's all been done in the pursuit of money.\n \n The European Union began as the European Economic Community; the opening up of immigration to New Zealand began for purely economic reasons.\n \n Thus are we reduced by the neo-Marxists to the economic units proclaimed by Karl Marx himself. He must be laughing his head off in whatever hell he inhabits to see that what his original philosophies miserably failed to achieve are being pursued afresh by a new breed.\n \n And I'll tell you what: The European Union will disintegrate just as the Soviet Union did. Why? Because the foundations upon which they both were and are built are Godless.\n \n http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=466&ObjectID=10328555",

   "North korea was cheating on its nuclear program while Clinton was in office.\n\n \n Not in the aspect they are doing now. North Korea's advancements were made because they gained access to fuel. The seals on the spent fuel were intact during Clinton's adminstration and before Bush made his speech. You really can't do a whole lot without the spent fuel. \n \n \nClinton did not have a containment policy. North korea blackmailed Clinton basically - give us food aid and energy or else\n\n \n Did it contain NK from gaining active nuclear arms? I'd say so. Still, the only point of getting a nuke in a third world is to black mail and as a deterrent. \n \n \nClinton gave in to North korea's blackmail . Do you seriously believe that Madman in North Korea?\n\n \n No, but the data about how weapons are made and the advancements made after Bush seem to indicate that it was Bush who pushed NK into massive overdrive to get nukes. \n \n \n\n They chose to brag about having a nuclear weapons while Bush was in office because Bush insisted on including other countries such as Japan, China S.Korea in their negotiations with North korea. North korea wants to negotiate just with U.S (like they did with Clinton) so that they can play their old game of blackmail and still cheat on nuclear programs.\n\n \n \n \n Unlike Clinton, Bush did not give in to North korea's demands thats why the madman in North korea has been rattling his saber.[/QUOTE]\n \n BRB",

He apparantly did it for the money and it went on for years and years.\n This happend during Clinton's watch. The fact that N.korea was buying nuclear know how from this scientist means that they were cheating while Clinton was in office. It only got exposed after Bush came to office. Just because N.korea admitted to having nukes after Bush does not mean that they did not have them when Clinton was in office . \n \n 2) Bush did not have to \"push\" N.korea into getting nukes. The madman in N.korea has had nuclear ambitions for a long time. He was determined to get nukes any way possible to use it as blackmail. He just duped Clinton . It is just that now after some factors came into light (eg:the pakistani scientist selling nuke know how to Libya and N.korea) that N.korea' s nuke program got exposed.\n \n 3) Why do you not approve of Bush's proposal of including Japan, China, S.korea while negotiating with N.korea. After all Japan and S.korea being so close to N. korea are at greater risk. China has more influence on N.korea than any other country and so why not involve the Chinese to put pressure on N.korea . Much better than Clinton's proposal of dealing one on one with N.korea when US food aid and energy (funded by the US taxpayer) were given while N.korea cheated and acquired nuke know how and technology.",
