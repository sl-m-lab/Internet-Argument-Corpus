And while hotly debated, the effect of this dramatic increase is largely unknown.\n",

Careful avoidance of the Heller ruling that it was a personal right and NOT a collective right which he and his fellow dissenters showed ignorance of.\n \n Perhaps they will understand better when the McDonald ruling is delivered next month?
