From reading the link posted earlier, it seems that the Canadians are going to take a stronger stand on trade issues with the U.S., the softwood lumber policies in particular.\n The Canadian lumber imports have a huge effect on my states economy. Until recently,the Canadian dollar has been a big factor in U.S. companies ability to compete with cheaper lumber prices out of Canada.\n Another factor, in my area, Maine, is the price Canadians pay for stumpage. A lot of the Canadians cut wood on what is refered to as Crown Land, which doesn't charge the same fees for cutting rights as private woodlot owners do.\n By some accounts they compare Harper to Bush. I'm not sure the Canadians realize just how bad that will turn out if those comparisons turn out to be true.",
