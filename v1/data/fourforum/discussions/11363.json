Besides, this is hardly an argument.\n \n Firstly, I don't claim that population density is the only factor.\n Secondly, you didn't show correlation between laws and crime. You showed a few examples in a table of 52 states, which does not show correlation. For that, you're going to need to arrange states in order of lawfullness, plot them against number of killings and show me something like a straight line.\n Thirdly, I have provided actual numerical data which contradicts your qualitative evidence - which you (again) rejected out of hand on the basis that my source was hosted on a .org, not a .com, both of which are freely available to anyone.\n Fourthly, I have explained multiple times that with the exception of DC, there is very little difference between US gun laws. Whether you can buy at 16 or 18 does not change the fact that the majority of the population are over both limits.\n \n \nMy point is weather its a gun or a car,you have to be responsible in what you do with either one.\nIt's a different point to your last post's, but a fair one.\n And yet with a car, you need to pass theory and practical tests, and hold insurance. This is only the case for guns in a very few states, and as far as I am aware no insurance is needed at all. Introducing tests would be a very good step in the right direction.\n However, guns are (proportionally) misused a lot more often than cars are. Weapon self-defence is rare compared to gun crime, whereas compared with how often a car is used, car crashes happen relatively infrequently (proportionally speaking). There are also almost no viable alternatives for car use, whereas there are for self-defence.\n \n In short: there is a lot more reasons for guns to be more tightly controlled than cars.

   "But not a true criminal.\nWell, you don't define yourself as a true criminal, because you think that gun ownership is justified. Some criminals don't define themselves as 'true' criminals, because they believe what they have done is justified, or was at least necessary at the time.\n \n \nWith this variable, it would be impossible to prove that gun control reduces gun availability.\nOnly if it exists and if it is statistically significant, which I don't believe to be the case. It's up to you to show that that variable does exist, now.\n And if that variable is significant, it also removes any statistics you might have, such as you are more safer owning a gun than not.\n \n \nYou haven't even proved yourself right yet.\nI've provided some evidence. That you think you can dismiss this evidence without backing up your reasons for doing so is your error, not mine.\n \n To analogise again, imagine I challenged you to show that owning guns saved lives. You find me some data stating that 5 million lives are saved by gun use each year, and I dismiss it on the basis that it doesn't show me the age of the people saved, because I think that there might be lots of younger people involved and lots of young people lie anyway. Wouldn't it then be my responsibility to prove that lots of young people lie, and that more young people own guns than older people? (Note that this is not actually my opinion, it's just a hypothetical analogy)\n \n You're dismissing my data on the grounds that there might be lots of guns that we don't know about. If those grounds are to be taken seriously you have to show that they are valid.
