   "This forum has been a bit slow lately so I thought I would add something for possible discussion. The topic I have decided to start with is \"Did Charles Darwin recant?\"\n \n Even though the topic is ridiculous beyond belief in the first place, it still seems to have some meaning for creationists. In the flawed logic of creationism they seem to think that if Darwin admited that he was wrong then it would somehow invalidate 150 years of verification. The claim is the equivalent of claiming that the earth is the center of the universe because Copernicus recanted his theory of heliocentrism on his death bed.\n \n Besides, what creationists claim was recanted was Darwin's \"theory of evolution.\" The problem with that claim is that Darwin didn't propose evolution but several mechanisms that produce evolution. The idea of evolution had been around for a number of years. Even Darwin's grandfather Erasmus Darwin wrote about evolution, writings with which Charles was quite familiar. So it would be ridiculous to claim that a deathbed recantation of evolution by Darwin would be meaningful. Darwin's major theory was the theory of natural selection, a theory that has been verified time and time again. Even if Darwin had recanted on his death bed, it would have the same meaning of a recantation by Copernicus.\n \n But where did this story ever come from? It seems that the story first came to light from an article published in the Boston Watchman Examiner. It seems that one Lady Hope, while attending an evangelistic revival meeting by one Dwight Lyman Moody in Northfield, Massachusetts claimed to have visited Darwin \"on his deathbed.\" Why Darwin would have known Lady Hope, why he would have invited her into his bed room, or why he would have made any recantation to her isn't explained. We are just expected to believe that this story is true and that this somehow makes the theories of evolution false.\n \n It seems that it would make good sense to ask someone who was without a doubt present at Darwin's deathbed, his daughter Henrietta. In 1922 she stated in the magazine \"Christian\", \"I was present at his deathbed. Lady Hope was not present during his last illness, or any illness. I believe he never even saw her, but in any case she had no influence over him in any department of thought or belief. He never recanted any of his scientific views, either then or earlier. We think the story of his conversion was fabricated in the U.S.A.\"\n \n Also consider that Darwin did not have a long last illness in which he was confined to bed. He got up and worked every day and dressed for dinner with the family. His final illness lasted only a few days.\n \n And then there is the word of Sir Francis Darwin (one of two of Darwin's sons to be knighted) who was his father's assistant and private secretary to the end. He has stated that his father's confidence in the correctness of his theories never wavered. Just read Darwin's correspondence (4 vol) edited by Sir Francis for a graphic illustration of that fact. Since Darwin was a greatly respected scientist of his time and the world's expert in a number of fields, his slightest word would have been paid attention to or at least noted by other scientists. Such was not the case. Instead the story came out several years later at a tent revival meeting in a mill town in Massachusettes. I am sometimes foolish but I'm no fool.\n \n But at one time Darwin was indeed a Christian, as was his family (at least in name). As a young man he began his studies in the family tradition, that of medicine. His grandfather (Erasmus) and his father (Robert) were both renowned physicians of their day. They were also able to build a considerable family fortune that allowed the children to pursue any course of interest. Although he sometimes comes off as a stern man, to read about Darwin's life with his family one realizes that Robert was a loving father. In following the family tradition, Charles' older brother Erasmus began his medical studies at Edinburgh University, to be followed a year later by Charles himself. Although Erasmus went on from there to complete his studies at Cambridge, Charles never did. He was so repulsed by the medical practices of operating without the benefit of anesthesia that he gave up all aspirations of medicine. Out of respect for his father and fear of his disaproval, he completed the course at Edinburgh. But rather than concentrate on medicine he began attending classes and became fast friends with the renowned zoologist Robert Grant and the equally renowned geologist, Robert Jameson, both of whom recognized his great potential in science. Those who wish to denigrate Darwin's scientific education should look into who his teachers and friends were. Because he studied so diligently with these men, they allowed him into their confidence where they imparted not only knowledge, but skills and logic.\n \n At the end of his studies at Edinburgh Charles finally mustered the courage to inform his father that he could not follow a career in medicine. Between them they agreed on a course of study in divinity at Christ's College, Cambridge, in the company of his cousin, William Darwin Fox. As luck would have it, Fox had a passion for collecting beetles to which he introduced Charles. Along with this came introductions to the leading scientists at Cambridge, including John Stevens Henslow. Henslow too recognized Darwin's zeal and abilities and the two became fast friends and remained so for life, even though Henslow did not agree with Darwin's theories. Probably the most important thing that Henslow instilled in Darwin was a confidence in his own abilities as a scientist.\n \n One trait that Darwin always seemed to have was the ability to devote all of his attention to whatever matter was uppermost in his mind. At the end of his days at Christ's College that was the exit exam. Although his academic record was less than distinguished, he passed and was granted his degree. Thus he was ready to begin his studies for ordination in the Church of England the next term. But first, at Henslow's recommendation he accompanied Adam Sedgwick, probably Great Britain's leading geologist of that time, on a survey of North Wales. Such a tour could only have given Darwin solid foundation in geologic fieldwork.\n \n But as you must all be aware other events then intervened. A young aristocrat, Robert FitzRoy had been 1st Officer aboard H.M.S. Beagle on a previous voyage when the Captain had committed suicide. FitzRoy finished that mission and was subsequently named Captain of the Beagle himself. He completed on more mission as Captain. But FitzRoy had also had an uncle who was a sea captain and had committed suicide. Moreover, he was subject to regular spells of melancholy and depression and he feared what they might mean for him on a long voyage. He decided that he needed a companion aboard with whom he could share meals and evening conversations and so he began to ask about for a gentleman who was also a skilled naturalist. When word reached Henslow he immediately put Darwin's name forward. Fitzroy accepted him after one meeting and had his own quarters divided so that each could maintain some measure of privacy. But Robert Darwin objected strongly to the trip on the grounds that it could do nothing to advance Charles' career. He was finally convinced by his brother-in-law, Charles' uncle, Josiah Wedgwood II (yes, those Wedgwoods). Thus, Robert Darwin financed the trip of his son Charles of a 5 year trip around the world. So in 1831 the somewhat pragmatic realist set sail with a young and idealistic, religious adventurer aboard, and together they changed the course of history.\n \n FitzRoy had a long and distinguished naval career, became an admiral, served as a member of Parliament and was for a time the governor of New Zealand, invented several valuable marine meteorologic instruments. Sadly, he died as he had feared, by his own hand.\n \n As for Darwin and whether he was ever a Christian, of course he was. But assigning times after 1836 are problematic since he never mentioned religion. Some claim that it was the death of his favorite daughter Annie in 1851 at the age of 10 that was the last straw. Darwin sat at her bedside day and night for months while she withered away, praying to no avail for some intervention. Many have claimed that he was a changed man after this incident and I have never heard that he ever made a reference to God after Annie's death. If he was not an atheist from this point on, he certainly fit the term coined by his friend, T.H. Huxley, agnostic.\n \n Darwin's wife Emma is also on record expressing her great regret that her husband Charles did not share her faith.",

   "Well, it seems that my topic is if the utmost disinterest. I can't say that I'm surprised. It just happened to be the first one on the list of suggested topics for the Evolution vs Creation topic.\n \n So I'll just carry on a little monologue with myself and then possibly move on to another suggested topic.\n \nThere is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\n\n Most of you with any knowledge of this subject will recognize that quote immediately. It is, of course, the final sentence of On the Origin of Species. The last word, used exactly the same in all seven editions of the book, is the only instance of any form of the word evolve in the book. In other words, Darwin didn't use the word. A search of Darwin's letters and other writings show that he rarely used the word, and then with exactly the Victorian meaning as in this sentence - it means change.\n \n It was not Darwin who used the word but rather his friend, T.H. Huxley. Huxley thought that it was a good name for the theory while Darwin did not. It was Huxley that caused the popularization of the phrase, \"the theory of evolution\" over Darwin's objections. Darwin considered his theory of natural selection to be his major theory. And of course, Darwin objected to the application of the phrase, \"survival of the fittest\" coined by social philosopher Herbert Spencer to apply to economic theory.\n \n Nevertheless, Darwin lost both of these objections and the theory of evolution now refers specifically to heritable changes in populations of living organisms over generations, while \"survival of the fittest\" has fallen into disuse in scientific circles, simply because it is a totally inadequate expression of the theory of natural selection.\n \n So the roundabout point of this little essay is contained in the words of Lady Hope as she quoted Darwin on his deathbed. She is quoted as stating that Darwin had said, \"How I wish I had not expressed my theory of evolution as I have done.\" It would be beyond belief that Darwin would have made such a statement since he did not ever refer to any of his theories as \"my theory of evolution.\" A search of the writings of Darwin for the word \"evolution\" or \"evolve\" reveals that he never used it in the sense of \"my theory of evolution.\" Thus the statement by Lady Hope is revealed as a lie by the very words used.\n \n Exactly what is the problem with so called christian creationists that they find it necessary to invent lies to combat the theory of evolution rather than offer a scientific theory of creation that can be verified by scientific investigation?",

   "\n Exactly what is the problem with so called christian creationists that they find it necessary to invent lies to combat the theory of evolution rather than offer a scientific theory of creation that can be verified by scientific investigation?\n\n \n Deathbed conversion stories were a favorite trick of the clergy by reducing a noted man's work to nothingness. It had its desired effect at one time, making the deceased look like nothing more than a mistaken, foolish hypocrite that only the most beneficent God, pressing grace to the limit, could accept.\n \n The appeal to this devious practice is easy to understand. The deceased, by his very last act, disowned his own work; no further refutation was necessary. No meddlesome facts to deal with, just a cold, silent corpse. Every person who the clergy deemed an enemy was treated to these deathbed conversion stories. During its heyday, a popular book called \"Closing Scenes\" by a Rev. Erskine Neale purportedly recorded last-minute conversions of frightened, repentant men of note, such as Voltaire and Darwin. \n \n Finally, this hoax was answered by another book, \"Infidel Deathbeds\" by G.W. Foote, http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/ethicsbook/x643.html, which carefully reconstructed the final days of many of the great men. \n \n The deceitful practice has slowed somewhat in this day and age, but the appeal to it is so great it is unlikely ever to die. It is great reading for ignorant, malicious minds.",
