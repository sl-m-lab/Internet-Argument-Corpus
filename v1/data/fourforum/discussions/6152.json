   "Yeah, he just smacked her across the face and spit in her eye. ;)\n \n \n Well, almost...\n \n \n http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/8/8/124941/6758\n \n http://www.americablog.org/\n \n \nCindy Sheehan is really something. The NY Times has another article for Monday's paper:\n \n President Bush draws antiwar protesters just about wherever he goes, but few generate the kind of attention that Cindy Sheehan has since she drove down the winding road toward his ranch here this weekend and sought to tell him face to face that he must pull all Americans troops out of Iraq now.\n \n Ms. Sheehan's son, Casey, was killed last year in Iraq, after which she became an antiwar activist. She says she and her family met with the president two months later at Fort Lewis in Washington State.\n \n But when she was blocked by the police a few miles from Mr. Bush's 1,600-acre spread on Saturday, the 48-year-old Ms. Sheehan of Vacaville, Calif., was transformed into a news media phenomenon, the new face of opposition to the Iraq conflict at a moment when public opinion is in flux and the politics of the war have grown more complicated for the president and the Republican Party.\n \n Ms. Sheehan has vowed to camp out on the spot until Mr. Bush agrees to meet with her, even if it means spending all of August under a broiling sun by the dusty road. Early on Sunday afternoon, 25 hours after she was turned back as she approached Mr. Bush's ranch, Prairie Chapel, Ms. Sheehan stood red-faced from the heat at the makeshift campsite that she says will be her home until the president relents or leaves to go back to Washington. A reporter from The Associated Press had just finished interviewing her. CBS was taping a segment on her. She had already appeared on CNN, and was scheduled to appear live on ABC on Monday morning. Reporters from across the country were calling her cellphone.\n \n \"It's just snowballed,\" Ms. Sheehan said beside a small stand of trees and a patch of shade that contained a sleeping bag, some candles, a jar of nuts and a few other supplies. \"We have opened up a debate in the country.\"\n \n Cindy, you have opened up a debate in the country.\n \n If you have any doubts about what a pig George Bush is, read the account of his visit with Cindy last year:\n \n The White House has released few details of such sessions, which Mr. Bush holds regularly as he travels the country, but generally portrays them as emotional and an opportunity for the president to share the grief of the families. In Ms. Sheehan's telling, though, Mr. Bush did not know her son's name when she and her family met with him in June 2004 at Fort Lewis. Mr. Bush, she said, acted as if he were at a party and behaved disrespectfully toward her by referring to her as \"Mom\" throughout the meeting.\n \n By Ms. Sheehan's account, Mr. Bush said to her that he could not imagine losing a loved one like an aunt or uncle or cousin. Ms. Sheehan said she broke in and told Mr. Bush that Casey was her son, and that she thought he could imagine what it would be like since he has two daughters and that he should think about what it would be like sending them off to war.\n \n \"I said, 'Trust me, you don't want to go there',\" Ms. Sheehan said, recounting her exchange with the president. \"He said, 'You're right, I don't.' I said, 'Well, thanks for putting me there.' \" \n \n Let's watch to see if Bush has the guts to meet with Cindy again. I doubt he will. They'll just want her to go away...or knowing this White House, they'll start some ugly campaign against her. But what they don't get is that Cindy has already gone through the worst loss any parent can.\n \n She is an American Hero...and you can keep up with her through her post, \"Camp Casey\" over at Daily Kos.\n\n \n http://www.mensnewsdaily.com/archive/m-n/newman/2005/newman080805.htm\n \n \nCindy Sheehan does not believe those filthy ragheads and camel jockeys in Iraq deserve freedom.\n \n Her son adamantly disagreed with her. U.S. Army Specialist Casey Sheehan, in fact, disagreed with his mother so vehemently that he was willing to give his life so that brown-skinned Muslims he didn't even know could be free.\n\n \n http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/search?s=Cindy+Sheehan&ok=Search&q=quick&m=all&o=time&SX=42f78380136d0d630efb9075ad41f85930b2a9c5\n \n \n \n Yeah, that poor sick deluded woman is just a tool of the Democrats! :)\n \n And now she's so sick in the head that she's camping at the Crawford Ranch spoiling our fearless leaders vacation.\n \n (How the hell did she even get within a mile?)",

   "http://www.truthout.org/docs_2005/080805I.shtml\n \n \nAfter Casey's death, Cindy Sheehan was invited to the White House for a visit with Mr. Bush in June of 2004. Her first memory of Bush's appearance that day was when he walked into the room and said in a loud, bluff voice, \"Who we'all honorin' today?\"\n \n \"His mouth kept moving,\" Sheehan later recalled of her meeting with Bush, \"but there was nothing in his eyes or anything else about him that showed me he really cared or had any real compassion at all. This is a human being totally disconnected from humanity and reality. His eyes were empty, hollow shells.\" Bush called her \"Ma\" or \"Mom\" throughout the whole meeting, and never got around to learning her name.\n \n \"The whole meeting was simply bizarre and disgusting,\" Sheehan said later. \"designed to intimidate instead of providing compassion. He didn't even know our names. I just couldn't believe this was happening. It was so surreal and bizarre. Later I met with some of the other fifteen or sixteen families who were at the White House the same day and, sure enough, they all felt the same way I did.\"\n\n \n http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1458638/posts\n \n \nBush, Sheehans share moments (The Story Before Cindy Sheehan Became a Tool for the Left)\n \n The Left is using this woman. They are \"working\" her, and keeping her stuck in the anger stage of the grief process.\n\n \n http://stopthelie.com/index.html\n \n \n \n \n I really really really can't wait until they arrest her (for being a \"threat to national security\"). Apparently she's not a threat now, but Thursday, well, we all know what happens on Thursdays.",

   "I can't find anything but a reference to The Reporter of Vacaville, CA.\n When you go to their site: http://www.thereporter.com/\n \n Ah! finally got the link to work\n \n http://www.thereporter.com/republished\n \n \nBush, Sheehans share moments\n By David Henson/Staff Writer\n \n Since learning in April that their son, Army Spc. Casey Sheehan, had been killed in Iraq, life has been everything but normal for the Sheehan family of Vacaville.\n \n Casey's parents, Cindy and Patrick, as well as their three children, have attended event after event honoring the soldier both locally and abroad, received countless letters of support and fielded questions from reporters across the country.\n \n \"That's the way our whole lives have been since April 4,\" Patrick said. \"It's been surreal.\"\n \n But none of that prepared the family for the message left on their answering machine last week, inviting them to have a face-to-face meeting with President George W. Bush at Fort Lewis near Seattle.\n \n Surreal soon seemed like an understatement, as the Sheehans - one of 17 families who met Thursday with Bush - were whisked in a matter of days to the Army post and given the VIP treatment from the military. But as their meeting with the president approached, the family was faced with a dilemma as to what to say when faced with Casey's commander-in-chief.\n \n \"We haven't been happy with the way the war has been handled,\" Cindy said. \"The president has changed his reasons for being over there every time a reason is proven false or an objective reached.\"\n \n The 10 minutes of face time with the president could have given the family a chance to vent their frustrations or ask Bush some of the difficult questions they have been asking themselves, such as whether Casey's sacrifice would make the world a safer place.\n \n But in the end, the family decided against such talk, deferring to how they believed Casey would have wanted them to act. In addition, Pat noted that Bush wasn't stumping for votes or trying to gain a political edge for the upcoming election.\n \n \"We have a lot of respect for the office of the president, and I have a new respect for him because he was sincere and he didn't have to take the time to meet with us,\" Pat said.\n \n Sincerity was something Cindy had hoped to find in the meeting. Shortly after Casey died, Bush sent the family a form letter expressing his condolences, and Cindy said she felt it was an impersonal gesture.\n \n \"I now know he's sincere about wanting freedom for the Iraqis,\" Cindy said after their meeting. \"I know he's sorry and feels some pain for our loss. And I know he's a man of faith.\"\n \n The meeting didn't last long, but in their time with Bush, Cindy spoke about Casey and asked the president to make her son's sacrifice count for something. They also spoke of their faith.\n \n While meeting with Bush, as well as Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, was an honor, it was almost a tangent benefit of the trip. The Sheehans said they enjoyed meeting the other families of fallen soldiers, sharing stories, contact information, grief and support.\n \n For some, grief was still visceral and raw, while for others it had melted into the background of their lives, the pain as common as breathing. Cindy said she saw her reflection in the troubled eyes of each.\n \n \"It's hard to lose a son,\" she said. \"But we (all) lost a son in the Iraqi war.\"\n \n The trip had one benefit that none of the Sheehans expected.\n \n For a moment, life returned to the way it was before Casey died. They laughed, joked and bickered playfully as they briefly toured Seattle.\n \n For the first time in 11 weeks, they felt whole again.\n \n \"That was the gift the president gave us, the gift of happiness, of being together,\" Cindy said.\n \n David Henson can be reached at schools@thereporter.com. \n",

   "http://www.thereporter.com/news/ci_2925925%22\n \n \nIn a media storm\n Protest draws national attention\n By Tom Hall/Staff Writer\n \n Last summer Cindy Sheehan got a face-to-face meeting with President Bush, complete with kisses and condolences.\n \n Today, the Vacaville resident is camped outside the president's Texas ranch - in the glare of the national media spotlight - demanding another face-to-face meeting, and ultimately his impeachment.\n \n Sheehan's son, Casey, an Army specialist, was killed in an ambush a week after his arrival in Iraq in April 2004. In June, the Sheehan family spent 10 minutes at Fort Lewis, Wash., with the president, who met with 16 other families who had lost loved ones in the war.\n \n Cindy Sheehan since has become a focal point in the partisan battle over the Iraq war, drawing the praise of many anti-war Democrats and the ire of Republicans who back Bush's decision.\n \n Her role in that battle exploded Monday morning, when Matt Drudge - the infamous commentator behind the popular Drudge Report, a right-leaning online news site - accused Sheehan of changing her tune to serve political purposes.\n \n Drudge's story, headlined \"Protesting Soldier Mom Changed Story on Bush,\" was posted in the highest slot on the Web site that receives more than 5 million visits per day. It drew quotes from a Sheehan interview published June 24, 2004, in The Reporter, suddenly dragging the newspaper into the fray.\n Vacaville mother Cindy Sheehan has not flip-flopped position, but has used her outrage and indignation to fuel an anti-war movement following the death of her son, Casey, in Iraq following an ambush in April 2004, according to Editor Diane Barney.\n \n That story, by staff writer David Henson, was an account of Sheehan's visit with the president in Seattle.\n \n In Henson's story, Sheehan admitted she and her husband, Patrick, debated before the meeting whether to ask pointed questions about the war and whether to vent their frustration over their son's sacrifice. Ultimately, the couple chose not to publicly criticize Bush in the meeting or shortly after.\n \n In Henson's story, Cindy Sheehan explained carefully, \"I now know he's sincere about wanting freedom for the Iraqis ... I know he's sorry and feels some pain for our loss. And I know he's a man of faith.\"\n \n Sheehan also said the trip to Seattle helped connect her family to others that had lost a son or daughter in Iraq. Sheehan said sharing their story with those families was rewarding, as was the time she got to spend with her own family.\n \n \"That was the gift the president gave us, the gift of happiness, of being together,\" she said in the story.\n \n Drudge included that quote in his Monday morning report, but didn't explain that it referred to sharing time with her family, not the president.\n \n Drudge also included more recent quotes from Sheehan highly critical of Bush and the 2004 meeting, including her comments made Sunday to CNN.\n \n \"Every time we tried to talk about Casey and how much we missed him, he would change the subject,\" Sheehan told correspondent Wolf Blitzer of the cable news network. \"And he acted like it was a party.\"\n \n Drudge's report fueled opinions Monday on both sides of the political spectrum.\n \n Posters on the highly visited liberal Web log Daily Kos said Drudge's report was misleading, while right-wing bloggers, including the popular Michelle Malkin, echoed Drudge's sentiments that Sheehan was contradicting herself, perhaps for political reasons.\n \n Sheehan, in a press release distributed Monday by the Institute for Public Accuracy, explained she was \"still in shock\" during her 2004 meeting with the president.\n \n \"We had decided not to criticize the president then because during that meeting he assured us 'this is not political.' And I believed him,\" Sheehan wrote. \"Then, during the Republican National Convention, he exploited those meetings to justify what he was doing. It's now clear to me that what I had feared is true: Bush lied us into war, and Casey, more than 1,800 other Americans and thousands and thousands of Iraqis are dead because of what he did.\"\n \n Several attempts to reach Sheehan by phone Monday were unsuccessful.\n \n The Reporter republished Henson's 2004 story on www.thereporter.com Monday. It drew hundreds of visits within the first hour.\n \n \"It's important that readers see the full context of the story, instead of just selected portions,\" said Editor Diane Barney. \"We stand by the story as an accurate reflection of the Sheehans' take on the meeting at the time it was published.\"\n \n Tom Hall can be reached at vacaville@thereporter.com. \n\n \n I guess Bush used her first...",

   "This is definitely true. Most polls are written to lead responses, and pollsters know it works. \n \n I believe Bush didn't make the right decision, but it was not deceit, as some like this mother accuse. Why would it be deceit to remove a terrorist from a position of power? That's a noble goal, pure and simple. It's just that Bush miscalculated the hardship of this task by a long shot. there is no reason to think Bush didn't really believe WMDs were there--much of the world did and the best intelligence agencies in the world (not just the US) indicated they were there.\n \n I agree with some of you that this mother had an axe to grind politically, and is using her own son's death to grind that axe. no matter what this mother says, it doesn't change the fact that her son was part of an honorable group of soldiers who liberated people from under a regime. I'd like to think that her indignation was her way of dealing with tragedy, but because of the political actions she taken in the past, I think she's really someone who was already an activist who's son happens to have been killed in war, under a president she doesn't like.\n\n There was a lot of deceit. The administration stated that it had solid evidence of WOMD, that Saddam and Osama were buddies for the past ten years that Saddam could build an atomic bomb in 24 hours if supplied with enriched uranium etc. The neo-cons agenda pre 9/11 was to gain control of Iraq and finish what Bush the elder had begun, 9/11 was just an excuse. The way things are going it won't be long before American casualties match those of 9/11 (we are half way there) and for what? For leaving Iraq in a much worse condition that under Saddam: Scarcity of water supplies, electricity, fuel etc and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis. And you are disgusted that one brave woman has the guts to protest against the futile death of her son? Bush ought to kneel in front of her and apologize.",

   "Here's another mother who either exploited her son's death for a political cause or was exploited by \"the left.\"\n \n \n http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/till/peopleevents/p_parents.html\n \n \nWhen her boy was killed, Mamie turned to the strength of her family and faith. \"When I began to make the announcement that Emmett had been found and how he was found, the whole house began to scream and to cry. And that's when I realized that this was a load that I was going to have to carry. I wouldn't get any help carrying this load.\"\n \n Horrified by the mutilation of her son's body yet determined that it would not happen again, Mamie made a stunning decision -- Emmett would have an open casket funeral. \"I think everybody needed to know what had happened to Emmett Till,\" she said. Some 50,000 people streamed in to view Emmett's corpse in Chicago, with many people leaving in tears or fainting at the sight and smell of the body.\n \n International Firestorm\n After two of her son's killers, J.W. Milam and Roy Bryant, were acquitted of murder, the Till case became an international cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre with news articles and editorials across the country and in Europe condemning the verdict and Mississippi. With the international firestorm, the NAACP, black leaders and Mamie were hopeful that Milam and Bryant would at least be punished for kidnapping. But just weeks before the grand jury met, Mississippi Senator James O. Eastland, a staunch segregationist and plantation owner, dug up information on Louis Till's past and leaked it to the press.\n \n The U.S. Army had executed Private Till in Italy in 1945 for raping two Italian women and killing a third. The insinuation: Emmett's behavior ran in the family. On November 9, 1955, a Mississippi grand jury refused to indict Milam and Bryant on kidnapping charges. Both men were free.\n \n No Government Help\n Mamie turned to the federal government for help, to no avail. She had not received her ex-husband's Army records, and she asked how a senator, but not a widow, receive that information? She also tried to meet with President Dwight Eisenhower, but he refused. And FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover wrote in a memo: \"There has been no allegation made that the victim [Emmett Till] has been subjected to the deprivation of any right or privilege which is secured and protected by the Constitution and the laws of the United States...\"\n",

Edward Schroeder II, said Tuesday.\n \n Schroeder, 23, died two weeks ago in a roadside explosion, one of 16 Ohio-based Marines killed recently in Iraq.\n \n The soldier's father said his son and other Marines were being misused as a stabilizing force in Iraq.\n \n \"Our comments are not just those of grieving parents,\" Paul Schroeder said in front of the couple's home. \"They are based on anger, Mr. President, not grief. Anger is an honest emotion when someone's family has been violated.\"\n \n Palmer accused the president of refusing to make changes in a war gone bad. \"Whether he leads them out by putting more troops on the ground or pulling them out -- he can't just let it continue,\" she said.\n \n White House spokesman Allen Abney declined comment other than to refer to remarks Bush made last week.\n \n At a news conference Thursday, the president said: \"Pulling troops out prematurely will betray the Iraqis. Our mission in Iraq, as I said earlier, is to fight the terrorists, is to train the Iraqis.\"\n \n The Ohio couple have long opposed the war and tried to dissuade their son from joining the Marines, but have made their views public only since his death. On Tuesday they urged Americans to voice their opposition to the war.\n \n \"We want to point out that 30 people have died since our son. Are people listening?\" Palmer asked.\n \n More than 1,800 U.S. servicemen and women have been killed in the war.\n \n On Monday, dozens of people, including several holding large American flags, lined the streets leading to the funeral for Schroeder, known to friends and family as \"Augie\" based on his middle name, August.\n \n \"Yesterday, it was Augie's day and we didn't want to intrude upon his day with politics,\" Palmer said. \"We have to move on and keep his spirit alive by helping to protect his buddies who are still out there.\"\n \n The couple applauded Cindy Sheehan, the mother of a fallen soldier who has camped out in protest near Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, for bringing the war to the public's attention.\n \n \"We consider her the Rosa Parks of the new movement opposing the Iraq war,\" Palmer said.\n \n On posterboards, Schroeder displayed photos of his son -- being cradled the day he was born; a blond boy eating corn on the cob; and the last photo the couple received of him, smiling in uniform, holding a Pepsi can and a rifle.\n \n Their son went to Iraq filled with optimism about the mission but gradually became disillusioned with the war's progress, his parents said.\n \n \"He said the longer it went on the less and less worth it seemed,\" Palmer said. \"They're not doing the job right now. It's not the fault of the troops. It's the fault of the plan.\"\n \n Salon provides breaking news articles from the Associated Press as a service to its readers, but does not edit the AP articles it publishes.\n \n \u00a9 2005 The Associated Press.

Posted August 17, 2005.\n \n He loved his family, his country, his classmates, and his life, 'but we don't believe he loved his mission in Iraq.'\n \n Chase Johnson Comley\n 1983--2005\n \n He is number 1,828, 1,829, or 1,830. We don't know for sure, because so many died that week. Our marine, Chase Johnson Comley, was killed when his vehicle was hit head-on by a suicide bomber. His death admits us to a club no one wants to join, a membership of grieving, questioning families who have heard the dreaded ring of the doorbell, a sound that reverberates in their worst imaginings and in their nightmares, and a messenger's words, \"We regretfully inform you that your son...\" You instantly realize that nothing you've thought, done, or felt has prepared you for this reality. The feeling is so much worse than a broken heart. It is an evisceration.\n \n As I write this, Chase is being flown to Dover. His 6'4\" body is in a coffin draped with the American flag. He loved his family, his country, his Sayre classmates, and his life, but we don't believe he loved his mission in Iraq. When recruited, he told us he'd be deployed to Japan. He called every week when he wasn't in the field to tell us he was counting the days until his return. He tried to sound upbeat, probably for our benefit, but his father, my brother, could detect in Chase's voice more than a hint of futility, and will never say \"my son died doing what he loved.\"\n \n For those of you who still trust this administration (your percentage diminishes every day), let me tell you that Chase Johnson Comley did not die to preserve your freedoms. He was not presented flowers by grateful Iraqis welcoming him as their liberator. My nephew died, fighting a senseless war for oil and for contracts, insuring the increased wealth of Bush and his administration's friends. He died long after George Bush, in his testosterone-charged, theatrical, soldier-for-a-day role, announced on an aircraft carrier beneath the banner, Mission Accomplished, that \"major combat was over.\" He died in a country erupting into civil war and turned into a hellhole by George Bush, a place where democracy has no chance of prevailing, a country which will, instead, most likely be a theocracy, much like Saudi Arabia.\n \n Have we won the \"hearts and the minds\" of the Iraqi people? Apparently not. Have we spent more than half a trillion dollars -- an amount that continues to rise -- on a war that King Abdullah advised Bush against because it would disrupt the entire Middle East? Apparently so.\n \n Consider what this money could have done for healthcare, our children's education, or for a true humanitarian intervention in Sudan. And then think about the inauguration of George Bush. Picture the lavish parties, the couture gown worn by Laura, and imagine the cost of the security for this event. And then think about Rumsfeld when he visits our troops. Picture his heavily armored vehicle, the same kind that transports Saddam Hussein to and from court -- those machines that are impregnable to almost anything the insurgents toss in their paths, while our troops are not provided sufficient armor to survive an improvised explosive device.\n \n Think of the mismanagement of this entire war effort. Think of Vietnam. Consider what we've lost. Too much. Think of what we've gained. Nothing. And think of someone who says, \"We will not cut and run,\" but who cut and ran years ago when he was called. Think about a man who speaks about a \"culture of life\" when the words fit some wedge issue like abortion or the right to die when medical effort has failed. And then think about this war, Bush's not-so-intelligently-designed culture of death.\n \n Think, too, about naming a campaign \"Shock and Awe\" as if it's a movie and, therefore, unreal. And then think that this, perhaps, is one of the problems. For many Americans, the war is an abstraction. But it is not an abstraction for the innocent Iraqis whose lives have been devastated by our \"smart bombs.\" And it certainly is not an abstraction for those of us who have heard the words that have changed our lives forever.\n \n So please, think of my family's grief, a grief that will never end. Think of all the families. Think of the wounded, the maimed, and psychologically scarred. And, then, consider this: The preservation of our freedom rests not on American imperialism. It depends on actively changing foreign policies that are conquest oriented, policies that dehumanize, not only our own young who become fodder for endless war but also those in other countries who are so distant that they become abstract. The answer definitely is not Bush's mantra, \"They're jealous of our freedoms.\"\n \n And, finally, think about the promises of those flowers. It's one of the many lies. Like the weapons of mass destruction. Or that we'd be welcomed as liberators. The flowers for Chase Johnson Comley will be presented not by grateful Iraqis but by those honoring him as he's lowered to his grave and buried in our hearts.\n \n Missy Comley Beattie of New York is the aunt of Marine Lance Cpl. Chase J. Comley of Lexington who was recently killed in Iraq.\n\n \n Note: Saudi Arabia is a monarchy not a theocracy. It's pretty close since they enforce Islam in the government, but it's not the same as Iran, which is more like a theocracy than Saudi Arabia.",

   "\n Yeah, that poor sick deluded woman is just a tool of the Democrats! :)\n \n And now she's so sick in the head that she's camping at the Crawford Ranch spoiling our fearless leaders vacation.\n \n (How the hell did she even get within a mile?)\n\n \n \n I find that rudely disgusting. Are you a mother? Have you lost a son? And then been insulted by your country's leader? Have you been in that situation? By your rude and arrogent attitude i think not. You would know if you have been there that losing any loved one would not immidetly classify you as 'poor, sick, and deluded' that would classify you as someone who has lived. I believe that you however have not lived. This woman has strength and a prupose. The only purpose i can see in your thoughtless banter is to tear open the hearts everywhere of those who have lost loved ones. I would be proud to so boldly stand for a cause and a purpose as this mother does. If president bush who im supposing is the man you call our 'fearless leader' would take the time to listen to the concerns of a citizen then maybe if he were to care he could use what he sees to consider how war affects people. If you can loosely use raunch language and degrade a mother's efforts to make known what has gone wrong to help better our country by pointing out fault so that if we try we can make it strong, if you can do this then you can walk those shoes, and feel that mother's pain, and every persons pain who has lost one they loved to a cause such as this. After doing this if you are still able to be so heartlessly cruel and unfeeling to the pain of others around you. I dont think that you deserve to live in freedom. Freedom bears a price some of us pay more deeply than others so everyone can enjoy it. But those who dont pay may have freedom, but they cant appreciate it fully because they dont know of having lost. What have you lost that makes you such a good judge of a mother who has payed in lost love and many memories gone to the grave with a child? What have you lost?",

   "According to Sean Hannity\n \n http://mediamatters.org/items/200508310004\n \n Hannity blamed \"anti-war left\" for protest at soldier's funeral actually organized by anti-gay church\n \n On the August 30 broadcast of his nationally syndicated radio show, Fox News host Sean Hannity falsely blamed \"the anti-war left\" for a protest at the August 28 funeral of Sgt. Jeremy Doyle of Indianapolis, who was killed while serving in Iraq. Hannity read excerpts of an article on the website of Indianapolis TV station WISH describing the protest, adding, \"I guess this is just another example of how the anti-war left supports our brave troops.\" In fact, as The Indianapolis Star reported, the protesters were not anti-war liberals but, rather, members of Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) in Topeka, Kansas, who claim that the deaths of U.S. soldiers in Iraq are inflicted by God to punish the United States for its acceptance of gays and lesbians.\n \n One of the church's websites claims that the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the space shuttle Columbia disaster, and the improvised explosive device (IED) attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq are examples of divine retribution visited upon the United States, allegedly as a punishment for the \"sin\" of homosexuality. A statement on the website reads: \"Thank God for IEDs killing American soldiers in strange lands every day. WBC rejoices every time the Lord God in His vengeance kills or maims an American soldier with an Improvised Explosive Device (IED).\"\n \n Led by Rev. Fred W. Phelps Sr., the anti-gay church also picketed the funeral of Matthew Shepard, a gay man beaten to death in Laramie, Wyoming, in 1998.\n \n Although Hannity read from a section of the WISH article explaining that the protesters see the deaths of American troops as \"punishment for social misdeeds,\" he went on to blame \"the anti-war left\" for the protest.\n \n From the August 30 broadcast of ABC Radio Networks' The Sean Hannity Show:\n \n HANNITY: Let me read to you from Indianapolis. Headline: \"Funeral for fallen Hoosier soldier brought some unwanted guests.\" Let me read this. Now, put this in the context of the story we did for you last week about Code Pink and about how Code Pink was protesting in front of Walter Reed Medical Center. Remember, they had their \"Maimed for Lies\" signs and \"Enlist Here and Die for Halliburton\" signs? And this is where these soldiers come back to try and get their lives together after receiving these awful, often life-threatening wounds. And yet, these people with political agendas are outside Walter Reed Medical Center protesting. And my point to them was, \"Hey, look, if you want to protest, let's leave the injured soldiers alone, they need time to recuperate. Take it to the White House. Take it to some other area.\"\n \n So anyway, the story in Indianapolis goes like this, quote: \"Emotions ran high for an Army soldier's funeral in Martinsville on Sunday. Sgt. Jeremy Doyle's sacrifice brought many out to honor him, but also sparked a standoff on a city street. People arriving to say goodbye to a hometown hero met an altogether different scene in Martinsville, as demonstrators dragging American flags on the ground and holding signs opposing U.S. troops. 'The thing that got us here is that Sergeant Doyle died for us to give us our freedom, and then you have people like this come. It's absurd,' one funeral attendee told News 8 in Indianapolis. Tensions grew before demonstrations [sic: demonstrators] finally left their location right across the street from Army Sgt. Jeremy Doyle's funeral service. According to the group's website, it sees America's -- Americans' deaths in Iraq as a kind of punishment for social misdeeds. Martinsville residents said that the protesters picked the wrong time in the wrong town to express their views. Which rightfully -- so they have their freedom of expression. Nobody's going to take that away from them, but there is a time and a place for this kind of thing, and it's certainly not here today.\"\n \n Now, who's Jeremy Doyle? Well, he died along with three other soldiers on August the 18th, when their Humvee hit a landmine on an Iraqi highway. This guy died for all of us. His final journey was a procession down Main Street, past the courthouse square. \"'If I had to lose a son, if I had to lose one, I'd -- I'd rather it be serving our country,' his father explained. The protesters were headquartered in Kansas. They traveled across the country to demonstrate against a soldier.\" And you know something? I guess this is just another example of how the anti-war left supports our brave troops. 'Cause isn't that what they always say? They're disrupting the funeral, tormenting a grieving family. Can you believe I even have to bring this story to the airwaves? And creating an incredible spectacle in the middle of an occasion to honor a guy who died serving his country? But of course, they're supporting our troops. They're not supporting them; they're targeting our troops!\n \n What's the difference between this or protesting outside the entrance to Walter Reed, where our wounded soldiers go to recover? I mean, these sol -- just can't believe that our soldiers and our -- and their families have to endure this pathetic atta -- these pathetic attacks, these chants, these posters as they enter and leave a hospital.\n \n - J.B.",
