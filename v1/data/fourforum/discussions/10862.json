   "McCain is now gay-baiting\n by John Aravosis (DC) \u00b7 1/29/2008 11:33:00 AM ET \u00b7 Link\n Discuss this post here: Comments (88) \u00b7 reddit \u00b7 FARK \u00b7\u00b7 Digg It!\n \n That didn't take long. So much for our maverick. When the going gets tough, John McCain goes XXXXX bashing. Note his adoption of the religious right buzz-phrase \"special rights.\" Considering McCain helped shoot down a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, I'm just curious how he defines \"special rights.\" McCain has always surrounding himself with gay men. Ever since I worked on the Hill in the late 80s, early 90s, McCain always had gay men on staff in senior positions. Openly gay men. Gay men who had no problem helping the gay rights movement. Gay men who people like McCain would call \"gay activists.\" McCain had zero problem helping powerful openly-gay men advance in Washington, DC. He currently has no problem employing them at the highest reaches of his campaign - the highest reaches - helping them work their \"special rights\" agenda in his campaign and beyond. But now we're to believe that McCain suddenly has a problem with the gays and their \"special rights.\"\n \n Mitt Romney isn't the only GOP candidate playing games with their position on gays. McCain has been trying to have it both ways on gay issues for two decades now. Privately helping gay activists while publicly condemning them. There's a reason that conservatives don't trust McCain. He's just a more refined version of Mitt Romney. Say one thing, do another.\n \n americablog.com",

   "The call, and audio file of which was shared by a Brevard County Republican and confirmed by McCain's campaign as their own, is portrayed as a social conservative expressing concern about Romney.\n \n \"Mitt Romney thinks he can fool us,\" says the voice. \"He supported abortion on demand, even allowed a law mandating taxpayer-funding for abortion. He says he changed his mind, but he still hasn't changed the law. He told gay organizers in Massachusetts he would be a stronger advocate for special rights than even Ted Kennedy. Now, it's something different.\"\n \n Romney, the caller continues, \"has treated social issues voters as fools, thinking we won't catch on.\"\n \n \"Sorry, Mitt, we know you aren't trustworthy on the most important issue -- and you aren't a conservative.\"\n \n McCain spokeswoman Jill Hazelbaker said they launched the automated calls as a response to the calls Romney sent out against them over the weekend.http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0108/McCain_sends_out_harsh_robocall_hitting_Mitt_from_Right.html\n \n Sounds like McCain is trying to go for Romney's votes, including on the issue of alleged promises to gays.\n Note the phrasing \"special rights\", which is a neo-conservative anti-gay buzz-word to denigrate equality under the pretense that preventing discrimination is somehow a \"special right\"...",

He opposed the federal amendment to restrict marriage in the constitution and exclude gay people, but he supported the proposed amendment in Arizona to exclude gay people from marriage. He has not had anything resembling a consistent position on this. \n \n I do not think that the Republicans have given up on the election. Indeed, I am not certain that American voters will choose either a woman or a black man for President. They usually won't say this out loud, of course. But I can foresee McCain being elected. I think racism and sexism are still very strong in our country, even though people are less likely to speak how they really feel out loud. But people vote in private. We may end up with President McCain. \n \n I also think that McCain's rise demonstrates the limit of the power of the Christian right. Bush was able to bring together the religious right, with which he identified, and the business leadership of the Republican Party, with which he also identified. He embodied this unlikely coalition in himself. Now the coalition has split apart. This is a great hope, I think, for those of us who want to see a Democrat in the White House. McCain, the mostly Republican nominee now, is in no way of the religious right, and many on the religious right will not support him. He also makes the leaders of the Republican Party uncomfortable, but they will support him. The coalition that brought the Republicans to power has come apart, and Democrats can capitalize on this. But will most voters elect a woman or a black man? I hope so. We will see.\n \n Whatever happens, even if McCain gets elected in November, our government won't be as horrible for gay people and for the country as a whole as it was under Bush. We will most likely have a Democratic Congress, whoever is elected President. And for all his flip-flopping on gay rights, McCain has never been a darling of the Christian right, and they can't pressure him into pushing anti-gay laws on the nation. I think McCain prefers simply to avoid the issue of gay people as much as possible. (Bush actually expressed the same thoughts; he had to be pressured by the religious right to come out in favor of the anti-marriage amendment. But he was able to be pressured, because the Christian right helped elect Bush. McCain would not be in the same position.)",

He may not be a patsy for the religious cuckoos, but he'll do whatever it takes to get their support if he thinks it's essential. I do not trust him an inch. He will do whatever it takes, integrity be damned. He's that desperate. He hugged Bush.\n \n With respect to your comments on Americans voters not voting for a black or a woman, I think you have a point. Many will say one thing in polls to avoid being seen as bigots, and do entirely another in the voting booth in secret. That's what happened in Virginia, if I recall. However, that die is cast. It will be either a black or a woman, and the Democratic margin in the polls will have to be major if they expect to win in the ballot by a whisker. The advantage either have over McCain (besides policy) is youth. McCain is virtually gaga, and a vigorous campaign is going to show up the weaknesses of age.\n \n If we have President McCain, do not expect any improvements over Bush. America will remain an international pariah.",

   "It's a sad commentary these days that America's natural allies are Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. In most of Europe except the crime-ridden, corrupt east, America is seen as dangerous. I've experienced a lot of anti-American hostility here in Britain. While governments try to take a longer view than populist fashions, they aren't independent of them. Within a year, America will be alone in Iraq, and Europe isn't going to care -- that is Bush's adventure.\n \n It's a pity. While I abhor and revile the Bush maladministration, I have a great fondness for Americans, and the freedoms they represent as individuals -- but I no longer have any trust in their institutions. Americans didn't deserve Bush, for all that they voted for the jerk the second time round. They are a better people, and they deserve better leadership.

He apparently is not conservative enough for the author, Randall Hoven. \n\n \n I think the main difference is that he's not in the pocket of the religious right. This is a good change for the Republican party, and I think people (in the party) have known for some time that the influence of the RR would eventually wane, in part because nothing like that lasts forever. It's been waning for some time now. However, that doesn't necessarily translate to wins on the part of Democrats. The Republican party has operated outside the influence of the RR before, and they can do it again if need be. Reagan sort of began that reliance on the RR, but for him it was still nominal as compared to today, and McCain would probably be a return to that sort of level of reliance. If you reject the idea that RR conservatism is true conservatism (in the Goldwater bent), one could argue he's MORE conservative than Bush, depending on the way you view conservatism. Bush and McCain embody different types of conservatism, IMO. And let's face it, McCain has certainly demonstrated a willingness to work with people across the aisle.\n \n I do agree that there could very well be people out there who are uncomfortable with a woman as president. I think it could be more so that way than with a black president. But I fear that if either or both of them lose in the end, then the automatic excuse given by their supporters will be because of prejudice, and that will not be giving the American people enough credit if that happens.\n \n I think the greater danger for democrats, more so than racism or misoginism, is simply that McCain could turn out to be a candidate that is more appealing in terms of issues like national security (which Dems ALWAYS seem to underestimate as a public concern, as evidenced yet again in the DNC debate tonight). I am pretty surprised at how little the DNC candidates are discussing it, given how much Democrats have taken a beating over it in recent years. They seem to be hedging their bet on a recession (which may indeed happen)--trying to shift the economy as a pet issue. I think the best chance they have is to shore up their weakness of national security.",

It's taking a principled public policy stance in favour of equal rights that sends the entire gaggle of them, including homosexual fellow travellers, running for the hills.
