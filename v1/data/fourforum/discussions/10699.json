   "Post I made on another forum, thought I'd bring it here for discussion:\n \n Christians often mention the fulfillment of O.T. prophecy in order to validate Jesus and Christianity. Matthew is often used to show how Jesus fulfilled O.T \"prophecy.\" The author makes it quite easy since he uses a \"prediction-fulfillment formula\" in his account. In fact, he uses it thirteen times throughout the gospel. However, he makes several grave errors in his usage of the O.T. I'll list two for you to browse. (Note: I borrow these insights from Reading the Bible Again for the First Time by Marcus Borg)\n \n Example #1 - Matthew 1:22-23: \"Here, Matthew uses Isaiah 7:14 as a prediction of the virginal conception of Jesus. But that earlier text did not originally refer to a virgin birth or to an event in the distant future. Rather, as the full context of Isaiah 7:10-17 makes clear, Isaiah was speaking to King Ahaz of the southern kingdom of Judah in the eight century BCE. It was a time of crisis: Judah was threatened by a military invasion. Within that historical context, Isaiah tells King Ahaz that God will give him a sign - namely, a young woman already pregnant will give her child the symbolic name Immanuel. (Immanuel is not a proper name, but a phrase meaning \"God with us.\") Isaiah then tells Ahaz that before this child is old enough to know the difference between right and wrong, the crisis will be over. In its eighth-century context, the passage promises deliverance to Ahaz and Judah: they will be safe.\" (p.116)\n \n You see, Matthew historicized O.T. prophecy by taking a passage totally out of context in writing his account. Was the virgin birth historically accurate? It doesn't seem so. Matthew obviously took a legend about Jesus and borrowed a O.T. passage to bolster his account. This is not \"prophecy fulfilled\" but creative story telling.\n \n Example #2 - Matthew 2:14-15: \"Matthew's use of Hosea 11:1 in his story of Mary, Joseph, and Jesus returning from Egypt illustrates the same point. Matthew quotes only the second half of Hosea's verse: '... out of Egypt I called my son.' But the full verse makes it clear that the prophet is referring backward in time to the exodus, not forward: 'When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.' Not only does the passage refer to the exodus, but it is Israel (and not Jesus) who is called God's son.\" (p. 116-117)\n \n Once again, Matthew takes a passage way out of context in order to make his account seem historical as if Hosea predicted that the baby Jesus would spend time in Egypt and come back to Israel. \n \n Talk about twisting scripture around...... Geeesh, don't Christians actually spend time studying their bibles to actually find out if they are following genuine truth or do they just read it in ways that support their presupposed conclusions about reality? I guess one must decide for him/herself.\n \n So Christians, keep reading your bibles and study them carefully. Don't let nonbelievers study more than you do because it is getting harder and harder to convince people that you actually know what you are talking about. Biblical illiteracy is rampant these days, mostly among Christians themselves.",

I went back and read the whole chapter in context and did some research, but it was obvious to me that it was indeed a long range prophecy dealing with a future event. First let me post the relevant passage in context then I will explain it as clearly as possible.\n Isa 7:10 And Jehovah spoke again to Ahaz, saying,\n Isa 7:11 Ask for thee a sign from Jehovah thy God; ask for it in the deep, or in the height above.\n Isa 7:12 And Ahaz said, I will not ask, and will not tempt Jehovah.\n Isa 7:13 And he said, Hear then, house of David: Is it a small matter for you to weary men, that ye weary also my God?\n Isa 7:14 Therefore will the Lord himself give you a sign: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and shall bring forth a son, and call his name Immanuel.\n Isa 7:15 Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and to choose the good.\n Isa 7:16 For before the child knoweth to refuse the evil and to choose the good, the land whose two kings thou fearest shall be forsaken.\n Isa 7:17 Jehovah will bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days which have not come since the day when Ephraim turned away from Judah -- [even] the king of Assyria.\n Isa 7:18 And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah will hiss for the fly which is at the extremity of the streams of Egypt, and for the bee which is in the land of Assyria;\n Isa 7:19 and they shall come and settle all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and on all thorn-bushes, and on all the pastures.\n Isa 7:20 In that day will the Lord, with a razor which is hired beyond the river, with the king of Assyria, shave the head and the hair of the feet, yea, the beard also will it take away.\n Isa 7:21 And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] a man shall nourish a young cow and two sheep,\n Isa 7:22 and it shall come to pass, from the abundance of milk they shall give, [that] he shall eat butter; for every one that remaineth in the midst of the land shall eat butter and honey.\n Isa 7:23 And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] every place, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silver pieces, shall become briars and thorns:\n Isa 7:24 with arrows and with the bow shall they come thither, for the whole land shall become briars and thorns.\n Isa 7:25 And all mountains that have been dug up with the hoe -- thither will they not come, from fear of briars and thorns; and they shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of small cattle.\n \n In verse 13, Isaiah turns from addressing Ahaz as an individual and addresses the entire house of David. The English language does not distinguish between \"you\" addressed to one person and \"you\" addressed too many people. In Hebrew there is a difference, and there is a clear change between the singular :you\" of verses 9,11,16,17 and the plural \"you\" of verses 13-14. The sign therefore is not just for Ahaz, but for the whole house of David. This becomes clear if we state the passage again with the singular [s] and the plural [pl] words indicated:\n \n \"10 Then the Lord spoke again to Ahaz, saying, 11 \"Ask a sign for yourself [s] from the Lord your God; make it deep as Sheol or high as heaven.\" 12 But Ahaz said \"I will not ask, nor will I test the Lord!\" 13 Then he said \"Listen now, O house of David! Is it too slight a thing for you [pl] to try the patience of men, that you [pl] will try the patience of my God as well? 14 \"Therefore the Lord Himself will give you [pl] a sign: Behold, a virgin shall be with child and bear a son, and she will call His name Immanuel. 15 \"He will eat curds and honey at the time He knows enough to refuse evil and choose good. 16 \"For before the boy will know enough to refuse evil and choose good, the land whose two kings you [s] dread will be forsaken. 17 The Lord will bring on you [s], on your people, and on your father's house such days as have never come since the day that Ephraim separated from Judah, the King of Assyria.\"\n \n In verse 14, the Hebrew word for 'behold' is a word which draws attention to an event which could be past, present, or future. However, grammatically, whenever \"behold\" is used with the Hebrew present particle, it always refers to a future event. That is the case here. Not only is the birth future, but the very conception is future. The key point of this should not be missed. The reason I posted to the end of the chapter is to show that God is promising that the House of David cannot be deposed or lose its identity until the birth of a virgin-born son. Again, this requires that Messiah be born prior to the destruction of the temple and its genealogical records in 70AD which is an historically documented fact.\n http://www.jesusplusnothing.com/questions/Virginbirth.htm\n \n As for the next example you gave from Hosea, I will look at that next, but on another post as this one is very long.",

   "\n Mat 2:13 Now, they having departed, behold, an angel of [the] Lord appears in a dream to Joseph, saying, Arise, take to [thee] the little child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there until I shall tell thee; for Herod will seek the little child to destroy it.\n Mat 2:14 And, having arisen, he took to [him] the little child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt.\n Mat 2:15 And he was there until the death of Herod, that that might be fulfilled which was spoken by [the] Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.\n Hsa 11:1 \n WHEN Israel was a child, I loved him,\n \n And out of Egypt I called My son.\n Torrey's New Topical Textbook\n Prophecies Respecting Christ\n His being called out of Egypt\n Hsa 11:1\n Fulfilled\n Mat 2:15\n This one is interesting as it is so obscure. I actually agree with you that it seems off topic and out of context so I can't explain it as easily as the other one. And I wont try to if it is beyond me too. I first thought that Hosea was not the passage it was referring to in Matthew as it just refers to the Prophet and not him by name. But I posted the reference from Torreys New Topical Textbook that aligns those two passages as first prophesying and then fulfilling it. \n \n And your statement about christians just taking these prophesies at face value without studying them and checking them out just isn't true. Although I can't answer this easily, that doesn't mean one more current on prophecy couldn't explain it easily. I will check with my Pastor though and see if he can shed some light on it though, and will get back to you if I learn anything new.",

FIrst of all, the word \"Almah\" is Isaiah 7:14 is not VIRGIN.\n \n Second of all, you didn't quote far enough, . Isaiah, in the very next chapter, tells who that young maiden is. It is his own wife (the prophetess), who he went to and insured she conceived. Plus, if you read BEFORE the section \n he quoted, you would find out that Ahaz was having a little war with the King\n of Assyria, and having someone born 700 years later is certainly not worthy for a sign that the king of Assyria is going to have his XXX kicked. The sign was before this child was much more than a toddler, (knows to choose good,and reject evil), this king of Assyria will be kicked out of the territory that was in contention.\n \n This is shown to be the case in Isaiah 8:18, when Isaiah quite plainly says that he and his sons are the signs from God, being the egotist git he was.",

Again, this requires that Messiah be born prior to the destruction of the temple and its genealogical records in 70AD which is an historically documented fact.\n http://www.jesusplusnothing.com/questions/Virginbirth.htm\n \n As for the next example you gave from Hosea, I will look at that next, but on another post as this one is very long.\n\n \n As others have pointed out already, the word used in the Isaiah passage DOES NOT mean \"virgin\". I don't remember the exact meaning but I recall that it is something to the effect of \"young woman\".\n \n As has also been pointed out, you really didn't read it in its full context, as later on Isaiah TELLS us who the person in question is.\n \n I'll get to the hosea thing later - got to go (shopping for our secular christmas :p )",

   "Well, this is showing how STUPID people who claim that Isiaiah is talking about Jesus are. FIrst of all, the word \"Almah\" is Isaiah 7:14 is not VIRGIN.\n \n Second of all, you didn't quote far enough, . Isaiah, in the very next chapter, tells who that young maiden is. It is his own wife (the prophetess), who he went to and insured she conceived. Plus, if you read BEFORE the section \n he quoted, you would find out that Ahaz was having a little war with the King\n of Assyria, and having someone born 700 years later is certainly not worthy for a sign that the king of Assyria is going to have his XXX kicked. The sign was before this child was much more than a toddler, (knows to choose good,and reject evil), this king of Assyria will be kicked out of the territory that was in contention.\n \n This is shown to be the case in Isaiah 8:18, when Isaiah quite plainly says that he and his sons are the signs from God, being the egotist git he was.\n\n \n In response to your understanding of the word Almah. Note the bolded...\n \n Your search terms were: Almah\n \n 1 documents were found matching your search terms, please wait while we prepare the listing. Results are in order of relevancy.\n \n Item Score Title Size (bytes) \n 1 1000 Is The Virgin Birth To Be Understood Literally? 27767\n \n http://blueletterbible.org/faq/nbi/1328.html\n Is The Virgin Birth To Be Understood Literally?\n The Bible teaches the Virgin Birth, or more properly, the Virgin Conception of Jesus. The New Testament records the fact that God became a human in Jesus Christ, and the means through which this was accomplished by the Virgin Birth - without the aid of a human male. It was a miraculous birth though a human birth. \n \n From Adam To Christ\n \n When God made the first man Adam He made his body out of the dust of the earth.\n \n Then the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being (Genesis 2:7).\n \n Eve, the first woman, was created from the side of Adam.\n \n So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; then he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place. The Lord God fashioned into a woman the rib which he had taken from the man, and brought her to the man (Genesis 2:21,22).\n \n All humans since that time have received their body through the natural processes- the union between a man and a woman. However when Jesus Christ was conceived it was without the aid of a human male. The angel said to Mary\n \n The angel said to her, \"Do not be afraid, Mary; for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David; and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and his kingdom will have no end\" (Luke 1:30-33).\n \n It Was Part Of God's Plan\n The Virgin Birth had been part of the plan of God from the beginning. It was prefigured in the Old Testament. In Genesis 3:15 we read:\n \n And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed her Seed; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.\n \n The seed of the woman that is referred to here is a prediction of the coming Messiah or Deliverer. He was to be born from the \"seed of the woman.\" The promise gives the first hint of the Virgin Birth.\n \n The Messiah Would Be Virgin Born\n As the Old Testament history began to unfold further evidence was given that the Messiah would be virgin born.\n \n Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call his name Immanuel (Isaiah 7:14).\n \n There has been considerable controversy about the Hebrew word almah, used in Isaiah 7:14, whether it means \"virgin\" or \"young woman.\" The word is not a technical term for \"virgin\" but rather means a young woman who has the characteristics of virginity. However it should be noted that in all seven occurrences of almah in the Old Testament it never refers to a young woman who has lost her virginity.\n \n Supposedly there is a better term in Hebrews for virgin - bethulah. Yet bethulah can refer to a woman who is not necessarily a virgin.\n \n Mourn like a young woman [bethulah] in sackcloth grieving for the husband of her youth (Joel 1:8).\n \n The Woman Was Assumed To Be A Virgin\n \n Even if Isaiah was only referring to a young woman who was ready for marriage the assumption would be that she was a virgin. Under the Mosaic Law a woman could be stoned to death for having a child out of wedlock. \n \n What can be said is that almah is consistent with the idea of a young woman who has not had any sexual relations with a man - a virgin.\n \n The Evidence From The Septuagint Translation\n \n There is also the issue of the Septuagint translation. The Old Testament was translated from the original Hebrew into Greek some two hundred years before the time of Christ. This translation is known as the Septuagint, or seventy. When they translated the Hebrew word almah in Isaiah 7:14, they used the Greek word parthenos, the usual word for \"virgin.\" Hence we can observe that before the time of Christ the people understood the passage to refer to a special birth.\n The New Testament Evidence\n While the virgin birth is predicted and implied in the Old Testament, the New Testament writers make it clear that Jesus was virgin born. Seven times in Matthew's account of the birth of Christ we have direct or indirect statements that Jesus as virgin born.\n \n The Listing In Jesus' Genealogy\n \n In Matthew 1:2-15 we have a number of people listed who fathered sons. For example it says, \"Abraham begat or fathered Isaac.\" Each name in the genealogy is written this way.\n \n However in verse 16 there is a change in the way in which the genealogy is written. Rather than saying that someone \"fathered\" the son the phrase reads, \"Jesus was born.\" Nothing is said about Joseph being the father of Jesus. In contrast to all the preceding men listed in the genealogy, Joseph is not said to have fathered Jesus but rather Jesus was born to Mary. This deliberate change of phrasing emphasizes that Joseph had nothing to do with the conception of Jesus.\n \n The Christ Is Born Of Mary Not Joseph\n \n Matthew is careful to state that Jesus was born of Mary, not Joseph.\n \n Jacob was the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, who is called the Messiah (Matthew 1:16).\n \n The phrase \"by whom\" is in the feminine gender in Greek. Consequently it cannot refer to Joseph but must refer to Mary.\n \n The Holy Spirit Is The Source\n \n On two occasions, Matthew makes it clear that the Holy Spirit was the source of Jesus' birth.\n \n This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about<b></b>: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit. . But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, \"Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit\" (Matthew 1:18-20).\n \n  Fulfilled Prophecy Of Isaiah\n \n Matthew cited Isaiah 7:14 in identifying Jesus as the fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy of a virgin birth.\n \n All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: \"The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel\" which means, \"God with us\" (Matthew 1:22,23).\n \n Joseph Was The Husband Of Mary\n \n Joseph is called the husband of Mary but not the father of Jesus.\n \n Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly (Matthew 1:19).\n \n Jesus Was Her Son\n \n In the announcement of the birth of Jesus the emphasis is on the fact the He is \"her Son.\"\n \n But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus (Matthew 1:25).\n \n In the birth narrative, Jesus is never called \"his Son\" or \"their Son.\"\n \n The Apostles' Teaching\n \n Matthew was one of the original twelve apostles. Therefore it is possible that the virgin birth of Christ was part of what the apostles taught the first church at Jerusalem. We are told.\n \n They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer (Acts 2:42)\n \n Luke\n \n While Matthew was writing to a Jewish audience, Luke, a Gentile doctor, was writing to a Gentile audience. Twice in his account he refers to Mary as a virgin.\n \n To a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary (Luke 1:27).\n \n Mary asked how she could have a child.\n \n How will this be,\" Mary asked the angel, \"since I am a virgin?\" (Luke 1:34).\n \n Luke identified Jesus as follows.\n Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the son, so it was thought, of Joseph, the son of Heli (Luke 3:23).\n \n In the accounts of Jesus' birth, Luke never calls Jesus the son of Joseph. Rather Jesus is the \"Son of the Highest\" and the \"Son of God.\"\n \n He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David (Luke 1:32).\n \n Jesus is called the Son of God.\n \n The angel answered and said to her, \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for that reason the holy child shall be called the Son of God (Luke 1:35).\n \n Luke Carefully Researched The Matter\n Luke's gospel is based upon his careful research as a historian.\n \n It seemed fitting for me as well, having investigated everything carefully from the beginning, to write it out for you in consecutive order, most excellent Theophilus; so that you may know the exact truth about the things you have been taught (Luke 1:3,4).\n \n The virgin birth of Christ was not just a rumor it was the actual way in which Jesus entered into this word. While it is not a miracle that can be verified by eyewitnesses, such as the resurrection, we have the testimony of Mary and Joseph.\n \n Jesus' Teaching On His Origin\n \n Jesus Himself taught that His origin was from above.\n \n Jesus said to them, \"If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and now am here. I have not come on my own; but he sent me (John 8:42).\n \n Jesus Claimed God As His Father\n On a number of occasions Jesus claimed that God was His Father. When Jesus cleansed the temple He said.\n \n To those who sold doves he said, \"Get these out of here! How dare you turn my Father's house into a market (John 2:16).\n \n Later Jesus claimed equality with the Father.\n \n Jesus said to them, \"My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working.\" For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God (John 5:17,18).\n \n The Testimony Of God The Father\n God the Father testified that Jesus was His Son. The New Testament records three different occasions in which the Father acknowledged the Son with an audible voice. At Jesus' baptism we read.\n \n As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, \"This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.\" (Matthew 3:16-18).\n \n At the transfiguration the Father testified again to the Son.\n \n While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, \"This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!\" (Matthew 17:5).\n \n Finally in front of the multitudes the Father recognized the Son.\n \n Now my heart is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour. Father, glorify your name! Then a voice came from heaven, \"I have glorified it, and will glorify it again\" (John 12:27,28).\n \n In doing this the Father acknowledged Jesus as His Son.\n \n Jesus Acknowledged Mary As His Mother\n Jesus acknowledged Mary as His mother.\n When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, \"Dear woman, here is your son\" (John 19:26).\n \n He never said that Joseph was His father.\n Others Thought That He Was The Son Of Joseph\n \n Others spoke of Jesus as the \"son of Joseph.\"\n \n All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. \"Isn't this Joseph's son?\" they asked (Luke 4:22).\n \n However the Bible is clear that Jesus wasn't the physical son of Joseph. He only could be called Joseph's son in the adopted sense.\n \n It Was An Appropriate Entrance Into The World For God's Son\n \n The virgin birth was an appropriate entrance of Christ into the world. Since He lived a miraculous life that finished with the miracle of His resurrection and ascension it is not inconsistent that He entered the world with a miraculous birth. The virgin birth is in complete harmony with the other miraculous elements of the life of Jesus.\n \n Summary\n The evidence is clear that Jesus Christ came into the world by means of a virgin birth or virgin conception. While God directly created Adam, Eve was taken from the body of Adam, and all humans since then have received their body through the union of a man and a woman, Jesus Christ was different. He entered the world without the aid of a human male. It was at the same time a human birth and a miraculous birth. This can be seen as follows. The Old Testament predicted the virgin birth of the coming Messiah In the New Testament in Matthew and Luke record the fulfillment of the promise. Matthew and Luke identify Mary as a virgin Matthew says that Mary was pregnant before her and Joseph had physical relationship Her pregnancy was due to the Holy Spirit Jesus Himself testified to the fact that God was His Father. God the Father verbally acknowledge the Son on three different occasions with an audible voice. Consequently the virgin birth of Christ is an established truth of the New Testament.",

   "Post I made on another forum, thought I'd bring it here for discussion:\n \n Christians often mention the fulfillment of O.T. prophecy in order to validate Jesus and Christianity. Matthew is often used to show how Jesus fulfilled O.T \"prophecy.\" The author makes it quite easy since he uses a \"prediction-fulfillment formula\" in his account. In fact, he uses it thirteen times throughout the gospel. However, he makes several grave errors in his usage of the O.T. I'll list two for you to browse. (Note: I borrow these insights from Reading the Bible Again for the First Time by Marcus Borg)\n \n Example #1 - Matthew 1:22-23: \"Here, Matthew uses Isaiah 7:14 as a prediction of the virginal conception of Jesus. But that earlier text did not originally refer to a virgin birth or to an event in the distant future. Rather, as the full context of Isaiah 7:10-17 makes clear, Isaiah was speaking to King Ahaz of the southern kingdom of Judah in the eight century BCE. It was a time of crisis: Judah was threatened by a military invasion. Within that historical context, Isaiah tells King Ahaz that God will give him a sign - namely, a young woman already pregnant will give her child the symbolic name Immanuel. (Immanuel is not a proper name, but a phrase meaning \"God with us.\") Isaiah then tells Ahaz that before this child is old enough to know the difference between right and wrong, the crisis will be over. In its eighth-century context, the passage promises deliverance to Ahaz and Judah: they will be safe.\" (p.116)\n \n You see, Matthew historicized O.T. prophecy by taking a passage totally out of context in writing his account. Was the virgin birth historically accurate? It doesn't seem so. Matthew obviously took a legend about Jesus and borrowed a O.T. passage to bolster his account. This is not \"prophecy fulfilled\" but creative story telling.\n \n Example #2 - Matthew 2:14-15: \"Matthew's use of Hosea 11:1 in his story of Mary, Joseph, and Jesus returning from Egypt illustrates the same point. Matthew quotes only the second half of Hosea's verse: '... out of Egypt I called my son.' But the full verse makes it clear that the prophet is referring backward in time to the exodus, not forward: 'When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.' Not only does the passage refer to the exodus, but it is Israel (and not Jesus) who is called God's son.\" (p. 116-117)\n \n Once again, Matthew takes a passage way out of context in order to make his account seem historical as if Hosea predicted that the baby Jesus would spend time in Egypt and come back to Israel. \n \n Talk about twisting scripture around...... Geeesh, don't Christians actually spend time studying their bibles to actually find out if they are following genuine truth or do they just read it in ways that support their presupposed conclusions about reality? I guess one must decide for him/herself.\n \n So Christians, keep reading your bibles and study them carefully. Don't let nonbelievers study more than you do because it is getting harder and harder to convince people that you actually know what you are talking about. Biblical illiteracy is rampant these days, mostly among Christians themselves.\n\n \n First of all the taking out of context is presented by the one suggesting that the author of Isaiah 7:14 did not mean what it said concerning A \"virgin\" actually conceiving and giving birth. The author of Matt. is making the statement that the \"virgin\" birth is being fulfilled of that \"prophecy\" and his name shall be Emanuel. It is true that the prophecy is quantified in the current historical context of that time, but it is also clear that the child was not conceived of a virgin, thus the prophecy was not entirely fulfilled. The mother may have been a virgin at the time of the prophecy but reading further along in the text it is clearly apparent that she was no virgin when conception took place. There has only been one virgin birth recorded in the entirety of the Holy Bible and it was Christ Jesus as He was the \"only\" one born of a \"womans seed only\", as He had no earthly father, and this is what the author is pointing out, the final fulfillment of that prophecy. Part of the prophecy being fulfilled in that time line does not preclude a virgin birth being fulfilled in the time of Christ. As the entire text was not directed just for that King, but for the entire House of David, \"And he said, Hear ye now, O House of David.....\". As I said, there is nothing that would preclude the Virgin Birth being fulfilled in the time of Christ.\n \n Matthew's Book contains a large number of quotations from the Old Testament prophecies, more than any of the others gospels, to show that Jesus indeed matched the predictions concerning the Messiah. There are numerous others giving supporting evidence that Christ indeed was who He claimed to be. This fact along must be considered, why would Matthew feel the need to falsify one with all the supporting evidence offered by the others? \n \n What I find mostly interesting is the fact for many to present their ideologies as valid they first must invalidate the scripts that were inspired by the \"Holy Spirit of Truth\", by claiming some type of \"corruption\". Thus they are calling God a liar, by presenting language that suggests that God is not capable of keeping His word that the Holy Scripts would never see corruption by man. \"The words of the Lord are pure words; as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shall preserve them from this generation for ever.\" (Psalm 12:6-7) Even the ones concerning a New Covenant, \"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah; NOT ACCORDING TO THE COVENANT THAT I MADE WITH THEIR FATHERS IN THE DAY THAT I TOOK THEM BY THE HAND TO BRING THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT;(the Law of Moses) which my covenant they brake, although I was a husband unto them, saith the Lord: But this SHALL be the covenant that I will make with the house of Isarel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God and they shall be my people.\" (Jer.31:31-33) It is very clear that this prophecy is speaking of the New Testament as it does away with the Old Law of Moses because they continued to brake it, and Jesus finally fulfilled the requirements of it by walking sinless upon this earth.

   "Two questions. What differentiates your \"true\" one from all the other \"false\" beliefs, and from which mountaintop can one see the four corners of the world?\n\n \n The answer is simple, the language is \"symbolic\" in nature. The mountain represents the highest authority that man has to offer. Notice the very scripts are symbolic, \".......And the devil, taking him up into \"a\" high mountain (there is nothing specific as to location, just a high mountain, not the highest mountain on earth), showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a \"moment\" of time(this passage of scripts shows that Jesus SYMBOLICALLY had power even over time, as He observed all this world had to offer in just a single moment of time). The nature of the symbolic text is 'revealed' in the very next passage of script.....\"And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them; for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will give it.\"(Luke 4 ). For you see, the scriptures also point out that Satan is the god of this physical world (2Cor. 4:4), but such only because the authority was given to him (Luke 4:6), he was a product of being created (Col.1:16), he is not omnipotent, because God is greater (1John 4:4), He has to ask permission from God (Job 1:9-12, Luke 22:31). LASTLY YOU CAN DETERMINE THIS PASSAGE OF SCRIPTURE IS \"SYMBOLIC\" DUE TO THE PRODUCT OF WHAT IS OFFERED....BECAUSE IT IS IMAGINED AND IS NOT REAL......\"For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; he also is to be feared above \"all\" gods; for the \"gods of the peoples are idols(symbols or images), but the LORD made the heavens.(1Chronicles 16:25-26). \n \n As you can see by the scriptures concerning the subject that which was offered was indeed symbolic in nature, because that which was offered was only imagined to be owned by he that offered, as Jesus the Christ pointed out. Some people can not see the forest for the trees, as they take a symbolic offer of power and greed to tempt the Lord and present it as some dogmatic symbolism of a flat earth theory. (BLU)",

Prove in science actual that creation is a product of natural methodology and we shall proceed, with your attempt at presenting you pseudo intellect to the world. Or better yet present the evidence of ONE star being gestated by natural methodology. But while you are surfing the web for links to paste consider this simple math formula. 100 billion galaxies x 300 billion stars/per divided by 13.7 billion years (the age of the OBSERVED universe) yields some interesting probability extrapolations. For instance, the birth of one star being born every \"37 minutes\" from the beginning of time and space. All I want is, one example of a star's water breaking. Do not point out some nebula that is theorized as birthing a star, and we just do not have enough \"observable\" time to witness this natural creation. Hey, with one Star having to be birthed every 37 minutes and the light from these stars taking millions upon millions of years to reach our observation, simply look up to prove this \"SPECULATION\". IF you can not answer these simple questions that pseudo science claims as evidence, by what authority do you wish to have my FAITH proven? On the other hand, if you wish to stay in the confines of Biblical script, and offer actual proof, not theory, that it is wrong....we shall proceed. For you to \"debunk\" religion with science, you must first prove that you are working and presenting facts from real SCIENCE. Again, if you can not, you are not, and you shall not.

So, to ask \"what happened before the big bang\", all anyone can say is \"I don't know\". \n \n Why do you people think that \"I don't know\" in answer to one question means a lack of knowledge in all areas? If I asked you to tell me precisely how many grains of sand are present on the planet earth, could you? Do you know? Well, if you don't, then using your reasoning you don't know anything, do you? You obviously can't be trusted to answer the simplest question, can you? I mean, if you don't know that, what good are you?\n \n Oh, speaking of grease slicks, I see your slimy trail heading out the door of that current events thread, again without answering any of my questions.

What created God? Because you're the one who has established that cause and effect have to exist 'outside/before' the universe. No?\n And if there is no cause and effect for god, then why would you assume there there has to be one for the creation of the universe?\n \n No one knows what or how the big bang was caused but such and event did happen. \n \n As said, you call the cause 'God' without ANY proof other than what an ancient book tells you. \n \n This has NOT to do with intelligence Archy, but with ignorance.\n Ignorance is simply a state of NOT KNOWING. And it's clear that you don't know logic and rational thinking. But, then again, rarely does your side value such. Instead prefering a delusional sense of elevation with an assumed spiritual discernment. \n Such 'spiritual discernments' are often proven to be the result of a neurotic or even psychotic mind.\n It's also quite telling that you can learn what we teach but you can't 'learn' spiritual discernment. No, you have to open yourself to cultic brainwashing techniques to eventually posses it.",

THE EVOLUTION OF MAN, as defined by the Darwinian Cultist. (BLU)\n\n Wow, so many assumptions. Where to start?\n \n Well, let's start with the population figures that you have given for today and 2,000 years ago (6.5 billion and 200,000,000). Okay, I have no knowledge of the population 2,000 years ago, but I'll agree with your figure for the sake of this discussion (yep, I've found that figure now too). This means that over the last 2,000 years the population of the earth has increased by about 32.5 times. Calculate the annual percentage growth over 2,000 years and you get approximately 0.174% (ie 1.00174^2000=32.5 give or take).\n \n Let's take a look at the percentage population growth for today.\n \n The Wiki people  give a figure of 1.14 for the year 2000. That's a bit different from the steady0.174% growth rate that would be needed to get from 200,000,000 to 6.5 billion in 2,000 years!\n \n Let's see what the population would have been 2,000 years ago if that population growth had been constant.\n \n 1.0114^2,000=7,012,915,289\n \n Look with a constant growth rate of 1.14% (as it was in 2,000) for the last 2,000 years the population of the earth would have been one seven billionth of what it is today. Ooh! That's less than one.\n \n So, perhaps we can conclude from this that the population growth figure is not a constant. You think?\n \n Perhaps the discovery of penicillin, research into dietary requirements, lower infant mortality, longer life spans in general, may have had an affect on this figure. So when you go extrapolating population figures, try using a moicum of common sense.\n \n So the population growth figure for 2,000 years ago would have been considerably lower than 1.14% and, in fact, lower than the 'average' of 0.174%. And presumably, when Mr and Mrs Grunt and their little grunts (the ones that managed to survive beyond 6 months of age) of 300,000,000 years ago were still storing their dead relatives in the pool of stagnant water they drank from, the figure would have been a little lower still. So when you go extrapolating population figures, try using a modicum of common sense.\n \n Smiley",

And as far as answering any question, you did not answer anything, you dodged the question and now are attempting to suggest that \"I\" can not answer a question.

I teach one of the physical sciences. I spent years working in a lab where we applied the physical sciences. Nowhere did I ever come close to even implying that I don't believe in the physical sciences. Try again, Holmes.\n \n \nYou are stating that it is OK for you to ignore a question because that which was a subject of query rests outside of time and space and can not be judged by physical law that exists inside the physical realm.\n\n I never said that anything exists outside of time and space. YOU are the one making that claim. In fact, this is the entire problem. You want me to address time outside of time. This makes no sense.\n \n \nYet, does not anyone think it strange that \"YOU\" claim that God can not exist because HE exists outside of physical time and space.\n\n Is this what I claim? Really? \"because He exists outside of physical time and space\"? Show me where I said that, please.\n \n \nCan anyone spell the word H.Y.P.O.C.R.I.T.I.C.A.L.?\n\n Can you read the word \"delusional\"?\n \n \nAnd as far as answering any question, you did not answer anything, you dodged the question...\n\n Actually, I didn't \"dodge\" any question. I responded to the question and explained why my answer was not the one you were hoping for. The fact that you don't understand four-dimensional space really isn't my problem.\n \n \nand now are attempting to suggest that \"I\" can not answer a question.\n\n Well, you can't, but if you'd like to make that a separate thread, I don't really mind. Your call.\n \n \nEither both God and that which gestated the Big Bang exists or they don't,\n\n Well, I don't agree with your logic, but you're welcome to believe whatever you want. I know that nothing \"gestated\" the Big Bang, so you ought to conclude that God doesn't exist by your own logic.\n \n \n... you can not say your mass/matter existed but did not have gestation of being and this is based on empirical science....\n\n Empirical observations are what confirmed the idea of four-dimensional space.

And considering I'm hellaciously more qualified than you are, my money's on me.\n \n \nWhat you just claimed is the Absurd conclusion that something existed before it came into being,\n\n I claimed no such thing. The only thing absurd is your tendency to pretend that I've said things that I didn't. In fact, I specifically said that there is no such thing as \"before\" time, because that would require time being outside of time.\n \n \nYet, it seems strange that your cohorts conclude that space is slowing down and coming to an end as it expends its energy, a process know as entropy, [snip link] which would result in the death of the universe. [snip link]\n\n Hoo boy. Trying to tell me about entropy and heat death as if I'm a dunce. Blu, on the physical sciences test that most states use for certification, the average score on the thermodynamics portion is 7/12. I got 12/12. No need to tell me about thermo.\n (This is where my students would all grin and yell, \"Burn!!\", because they're punny like that.)\n \n \nNow it does not take a very intelligent person to conclude that if something is projected as to having an ending it must therefore have had a beginning, and proven not to be \"eternal\".\n\n I maintain that it takes a not very intelligent person to come to this conclusion. How about the domain of ln(-x)? \n \n \nAnd yet you cannot answer the question of the claimed materialistic theory that the UNIVERSE somehow created itself while ignoring physical science.\n\n Where did I say that the universe \"created itself\"? Do you have anything but strawmen in that hayloft?\n \n \nNow you have proven that you do not have the ability to answer a simple scientific query placed before your materialistic theory of creation....\n\n Again, not \"of creation.\" All you've done is proven that you really have no understanding of space-time. That's often the case with the scientifically ignorant.\n \n \nYET YOU 'DEMAND' that I answer a question based upon the same principal as your conclusions, that the Universe is a product of that which exists outside of time and space.\n\n I think it's only reasonable for you to have to support your position which -- unlike mine -- actually is that the universe is a product of that which exists outside space-time.\n \n \nYou simply, cannot explain how anything could possibly exist before it was created,\n\n No, I cannot -- because nobody can -- explain how time existed before time existed, because the very concept is incoherent.\n \n \nyet you want to judge that which you suggested was possible, the existence of mass/matter outside of time and space by placing it at the mercy of physical science.\n\n Liar.

But as usual, you completely ignored that evidence as you insist your right as you tighten and adjust your blinders on your face. Here's the content of the link in my post above so you don't sprain your finger clicking on it.\n National Geographic Magazine\n Joins The Dating Game\n \u00a9 John Woodmorappe. All Rights Reserved.\n \n recent National Geographic article fails to portray the commonly used age-determination methods either accurately or objectively. The fact that the readership largely consists of unsuspecting laypeople makes this all the more inexcusable. All dating methods related to the unobservable past rely on unverifiable assumptions, chief of which is the one about closed systems. Furthermore, all dating methods involve the subjective evaluation of data and results, so much so, that their veracity must seriously be questioned. Recent attempts to extend the radiocarbon (14C) dating method back in time provide an instructive example of how age determinations are manipulated.\n \n National Geographic magazine (NG), an American periodical, is well known worldwide for its beautiful photographs and outstanding depictions of nations and cultures.[1] Owing to its usual excellence, it has been translated into several languages. \n Unfortunately, and especially so in recent years, National Geographic magazine has increasingly deviated from the subject of geography and become a virtual propaganda mouthpiece for evolutionary speculations. Its pro-evolutionary fanaticism has led to a severe lack of discernment, even extending to pushing frauds, such as the 'Piltdown Bird' it called Archaeoraptor, which they claimed (before publishing a far less prominent retraction) as 'proof' that dinosaurs evolved into birds-see Smithsonian criticizes National Geographic's Dino-to-Bird Claims and On the Alleged Dinosaurian Ancestry of Birds.\n \n Many years ago, its promotion of Zinjanthropus boisei as an 'ape-man' and even the 'missing link' had a great effect on the young (9-yr-old). Now even evolutionists have abandoned this creature, now called Paranthropus, as a missing link, but the effect was profound at the time. Later, as an adult and ex-evolutionist, Dr. Wieland was determined to produce a magazine as high in outward quality but promoting the truth-hence Creation Magazine was born.\n \n A recent NG article[2] has presented the unsuspecting reader with a totally one-sided and uncritical portrayal of the dating methods used by conventional (uniformitarian) geologists. Evidently, NG is now being pressed into service as a cheerleader for the dogmas of the old Earth and Universe.\n \n Dates: Assumptions and Data Manipulation\n \n National Geographic hardly mentions a word about the many dubious assumptions of isotopic dating (see also Q&A: Radiometric Dating). To rectify this situation, I briefly outline here some of the many fallacies of isotopic dating[3] and discuss some recent developments in the field of age determination.\n \n The NG article lumps all dating methods together, regardless of their assumptions or the span of time supposedly measured by the dating method. Implicitly, it seems there is a deceptive equating of different dating methods. That is, the article discusses forensic entomology, the use of certain insects' life cycles to help determine how long a human corpse or skeleton had been buried. However, we can follow the insects' life stages in their entirety. By contrast, dating methods that are alleged to measure geologic events of millions and billions of years clearly depend on unverified and unverifiable assumptions. Who was there when the universe or Earth formed?\n \n The Hubble Constant is highlighted in the National Geographic article, and conventionally accepted cosmogonies are presented as proof for the old age of the Universe. Alternate interpretations are not even hinted at, despite many flaws in conventional big bang cosmology. Similarly, the National Geographic article tells the reader that the oldest rock from Earth dates at 4.03 billion years. This is not true. There have been much 'older' dates obtained, by various dating methods and from different locations on Earth, some of which exceed 10 billion years. Nevertheless, because the age of the Earth is conventionally accepted at 4.6 billion years, these older 'dates' have been ignored or explained away.\n \n All isotopic dating methods are based on the radioactive decay of certain nuclides and the associated production of daughter isotopes. How can we be certain that radioactive decay rates have not changed in the past? The NG article assures the reader that they have been constant for all time. Actually, it was once believed that external physical processes could only alter decay rates, at most, by a few percent. Now we realize that there are physical processes capable of hugely changing radioactive decay rates of certain radioactive isotopes. In fact, stripping an atom entirely of electrons has speeded up beta decay by a factor of a billion. If we assume a different history of the early Universe, it is possible that at least the Re-Os and Lu-Hf 'clocks' produced billions of years worth of radiogenic isotopes in only one day. Nuclear physicists Drs. Eugene Chaffin and Russell Humphreys suggest that the nuclear decay rate was highly accelerated during Creation Week and possibly during the Flood year. They support this theoretically by applying quantum mechanics and the effect of the Universe's expansion, and evidentially by the amount of helium still retained in minerals, and radiohalos.[4]\n \n All dating methods assume a closed system-that no isotopes were gained or lost by the rock since it formed. There is no way of knowing if this was the case. Moreover, whenever dates obtained from rocks are not acceptable to existing geologic theories, the assumptions are suddenly reversed, and we are told that those particular rocks must have become open systems! Obviously, uniformitarian geologists want to have it both ways.\n \n Open system behavior has been investigated experimentally by heating igneous rocks. The results have been used to argue that, apart from exceptional situations (where rocks are heated up to at least several hundred degrees Centigrade), it is very difficult for rocks to become open systems. However, we now realize that hydrothermal waters, at temperatures of only a few hundred degrees Centigrade, can readily move chemical species from one rock system to another.[5] Even rocks which show no microscopic evidence of alteration often give 'impossible' dates, so uniformitarian geologists tell us that these rocks have become open systems-even when independent evidence is completely absent.\n \n Conventional (uniformitarian) geologists usually claim that, if dates are consistent, this proves closed systems. But, to begin with, the majority of dates are not consistent for the same rock. Second, the claims about consistency, despite their intuitive appeal, are themselves assumptions, and some of these assumptions have already been proved incorrect. For instance, it had long been supposed that if the data points formed a straight line on an 'isochron graph' then the resultant 'date' was valid. But now we know that meaningless isochrons can be 'inherited' from pre-existing rocks. Furthermore, the points on an isochron can be rotated during subtle open-system events yet still maintain a straight line on the graph. Third, uniformitarian geologists violate their own principle when they reject 'impossible' dates even if they are consistent with each other.\n \n It is not generally realised that most dates obtained from rocks are thrown out for one reason or another. This sobering fact is not even vaguely hinted at in the NG article. Sometimes it is claimed that geologists know which date is valid and which is not, but there are many situations when there are conflicting dates. Even uniformitarian geologists themselves cannot agree which date to accept and which to reject. So much for that claim! Some examples of conflicting dates are:\n \n Charred wood, buried by a basalt lava flow, was 14C-'dated' at about 45,000 years old, but the basalt was K-Ar 'dated' at 37 million years old. See Radioactive 'Dating' in Conflict!\n \n The Hawkesbury Sandstone is assigned a Middle Triassic 'age' of around 225-230 million, yet it contained fossil wood with 14C activity, although this should be non-existent if the wood were truly more than about 100,000 years old. See Dating Dilemma.\n \n Isotopic dates carry a great deal of self-congratulatory baggage. For instance, the NG article mentions uranium-lead dates from zircons as having survived multiple cycles of igneous processes (like bricks can be reused to construct more than one building). But there is usually no independent way of knowing this, and the inherited-zircon rationalization is invoked, after-the-fact, whenever zircons give U-Pb dates that are older than expected for the rock. In other words, instead of questioning the validity of the dating method, uniformitarians tell us that the zircon minerals originally crystallized in some older rock, but had become freed and entrapped in the younger magma, which eventually became their present host igneous rock!\n \n We sometimes hear the claim that the dates must be valid because they give dates in the millions and billions of years. But modern lavas frequently give anomalously old dates in the millions to billions of years. For example:\n \n Several 20th century andesite lava flows from Mt. Ngauruhoe, New Zealand gave potassium-argon (K-Ar) 'dates' from <0.27 to 3.5 million years. See Radioactive dating failure.\n \n A 1986 dacite lava dome at Mt St Helens volcano gave a (K-Ar) 'date' of method as 0.35 \u00b1 0.5 million years old. See Radio-dating in rubble.\n \n I have yet to hear a uniformitarian suggest that this proves that modern lava flows are actually millions to billions of years old!\n \n Nor has it been proved that there is a consistent trend between isotopic dates and the relative dates of the fossil-bearing rocks. To evaluate this claim, we would have to see all of the dates obtained (note that most discrepant dates are not published) and these would have to be weighted for the size of the igneous outcrop. Only then could we say whether there is a 'younging-up' trend of isotopic dates relative to the claimed progressively younger fossils. And even if such a trend actually exists, it could potentially be explained through geochemical processes without any of the dates themselves being valid age-indicators at all.\n \n Some Recent Developments in 'Age Determination'\n \n I now focus on those dating methods which are claimed to give dates from several thousand years to about 1 million years, as these are cited in the National Geographic article, particularly with reference to presumed human evolution.\n \n Let us consider attempts to check carbon-14 dates with other supposed indicators of time. It was recently claimed that a count of presumably annual varves at Lake Suigetsu, Japan, agreed with 14C dates to at least 38,000 years before the present.[6] Conventional uniformitarian thinking would maintain that this agreement is powerful evidence for the accuracy of the dates: After all, we have agreement between two completely independent dating systems. Furthermore, one of the dating methods does not even require radioactive decay.\n \n Well, not so fast, as it recently has turned out. As dates from other 'time indicators' became available, the majority of them strongly disagreed with 14C. These new dates typically gave values as much as 10,000 years older than carbon-14 (within the 14C range of dates spanning 30,000 to 40,000 years before the present).[7] Note that these dates are published, and so are presumably the 'good' dates. So what is to be done with the data from Lake Suigetsu? As always, whenever an age determination falls out of favor, a rationalization must be invoked to justify its rejection. As documented in my earlier-cited works,[3] there exists an elaborate Orwellian language for routinely dealing with unwanted dates. In the case of Lake Suigetsu, a set of 'missing varves' was invoked.[8]\n \n But what if the Lake Suigetsu data remains favored, for one reason or another? Never fear. Other rationalizations are available, just in case, for the data that disagrees with the Lake Suigetsu 14C chronology. These include incorrect initial- 230Th correction for the 230Th dates, unsupported gain or loss of uranium or thorium, a variety of possible errors in the correlation of deep-sea cores, etc.[9]\n \n Conclusion\n \n National Geographic magazine has only presented the positive spin about the dating methods. Of course, it is hardly alone in its rosy portrayal of age-determination methods. Owing to the centrality of the old-Earth dogma in our culture, the maintenance of public belief in dating methods is of the utmost priority. On this basis, it is hardly surprising that the unsuspecting layperson, as well as the innocent child in the classroom, is taught that the dates that are determined by the dating methods are gospel truth. It is all the more important for creationist scientists to expose the flawed claims of all the presumed methods of age determination, and to get the word out to the general public about this misinformation.\n ",

Enlighten me, Archie: show me any reputable science organization that acknowledges and explains this. Maybe some, any evidence of this at all.\n \n \nDon't you understand that if you can't start out knowing exactly how, why, when and where the Big Bang occurred, and under what precise circumstances that it occurred, then every other extrapolation you espouse from the expansion of the Universe to the forming of the Galaxies and Solar Systems right down to the spontaneous appearance of life on Earth are all questionable outcomes based on erroneous data.\n\n So if I don't know how, when, and where you were born, I can't possibly know whether you're really posting on an internet forum?

Nothing says that I have to know everything about the \"origin\" of the universe to know anything about the universe. Well, nothing except you, and nobody listens to what you consider \"logic.\"\n \n \nThat's another unprovable assumption Zardoz. Just because this Universe is finite, it doesn't stand to reason at all that God must also be finite.\n\n Zardoz went so far as to say that it's a presumption. If we presume that the things that make our universe tick also apply outside of the universe -- a presumption with no evidence -- then the presumption should be applied consistently within the presumptuous reasoning. In other words, if you insist that cause/effect relationships exist outside of the universe in the same way that they exist inside the universe, then the cause/effect argument applies to all things outside the universe, including God. This is what Zardoz was saying, unless I'm mistaken.\n \n \n \nEspecially since God say's He is the great I AM who created everything that is.\n\n I can say that, too. Show me evidence.\n \n \nThen show me the books that monkey farts and pink unicorns claim to have written when most Societies had no written languages at all, yet has survived until now and is still an important presence on Earth. Go on Zardoz, show me their books of wisdom.\n\n You want me to respond to this? What's to respond to? You're just saying, \"Oh yeah you big poopyhead?! Well, I have this Bible thingy, and, like, stuff, and stuff!\" What the hell does the Bible have to do with alphabet-less societies?\n \n \nBut I have already shown that your observations and science aren't worth the paper they're written on so why should we take them seriously at all.\n\n But you haven't. The fact that you know that I'm responding to you even though you don't know where I came from is evidence that you know your argumentation is wrong but refuse to acknowledge that fact.\n \n \nRemember that if all of the assumptions regarding the creation of the Universe which is the big bang is wrong, then all of the rest of your assumptions about Creation, life on Earth and who we are as human beings is all nothing more that wishful thinking too.\n\n I wonder how long you're going to cling to this argumentation.

You can't appeal to temporal effects outside of the temporal realm.\n \n Seriously, sit and think about this for a while, or something. Clearly you're not getting it.\n \n \nIn fact time is concluded not to have began until after the fact that all mass/matter was placed into motion as an after effect of that supposed fact. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time\n\n Hey, a foul tip is better than your previous swings where missed by a mile. Look at what you just said, even though you botched it at the end: There was no time the universe didn't exist. The universe has existed for all time. Therefore there was no \"before the universe existed.\" Time and the universe are inseparable.\n \n \nNow you are questioning your own logic\n\n I'm not questioning my logic about the beginning of the universe. Where did I say any such thing? You have a habit of making strawmen, don't you?\n \n \n... as you present another idea based upon speculation only, that nothing can exist outside of time. Which is it, can something exist outside of time, or can it not?\n\n My speculation about extratemporal existence has no necessary tie to this temporal universe. It is admittedly difficult to think of something being outside of time, but assuming the existence of such an entity is not my forte. Unlike you, I prefer evidence, and I've seen no evidence of an extratemporal being.\n \n \nIf it can, then you can not declare by speculation only that God cannot exist, because nothing can exist outside of time and space.\n\n Maybe you should go back to kindergarten and learn how to read. I said that I cannot definitively disprove the existence of any and all gods, but I can make some damn compelling arguments of some gods based on their alleged attributes, therefore disproving either that particular god's existence or disproving one or more attributes.\n \n \nIf it cannot, then you are concluding that your own ideology is based upon a scientific paradox of absurd thinking, that concludes that the universe was a product of something which must have existed before it came into existence. WOW, and they call faith a crazy concept.\n\n You essentially quoted the solution to the alleged \"paradox,\" and you still maintain that there is an \"absurd\" paradox. Faith may be crazy, but pure, unadulterated comprehension doesn't get that particular out.",

A theory is not a proven fact as of yet. The only reason gravity is still considered a theory has nothing to do with an apple dropping from a tree and hitting the ground because we all understand that aspect of gravitational pull. But how does gravity effect light, air, the atmosphere and Space? Studies are still going on to answer those questions. \n \n \n \n Don't you understand that if you can't start out knowing exactly how, why, when and where the Big Bang occurred, and under what precise circumstances that it occurred, then every other extrapolation you espouse from the expansion of the Universe to the forming of the Galaxies and Solar Systems right down to the spontaneous appearance of life on Earth are all questionable outcomes based on erroneous data.\n\n \n \nSo if I don't know how, when, and where you were born, I can't possibly know whether you're really posting on an internet forum?

All you have to do is ask me those questions as we are both living beings who are contemporaries that share the same time and space, speak the same language and are in a position to actually communicate together.\n \n Now you go interview the big bang and then come back and tell me what he/she said. Have that conversation lyte, and report your results and make quantum physics history. Now in order to avoid looking stupid, come back and explain to me how I misunderstood what you were saying. \n \n And I never said we had to know everything about the Universe in order to understand anything about it. What I said was that since the big bang is totally theoretical, then unless we truly understand the when, how, where and why of its occurrence, then all of the information we extrapolate from it is without any solid foundation even in theory. Let me simplify this for you; \n \n if you are doing an algebraic equation and at the very beginning of the equation you mistakingly place a 2x where a 5y should go, is that equation going to be correct in the end?

And since they allow for a gap of billions of years plus or minus in stating the actual age, then it's fair to say they don't actually have a clue in reality.\n \n And yet, if someone starts a new thread tomorrow about when the Earth was formed and when life began here, you will post the same numbers you have in the past as if they are facts.

On the other hand, I suspect that said mental deficiencies are the main cause of our disagreement.\n \n \nAnd I never said we had to know everything about the Universe in order to understand anything about it. What I said was that since the big bang is totally theoretical, then unless we truly understand the when, how, where and why of its occurrence, then all of the information we extrapolate from it is without any solid foundation even in theory.\n\n And I've disproved your asinine claim by parody. I didn't paint your position as requiring us to know \"everything\" about something in order to understand anything about it. All I did was make it clear that we don't need to know of a thing's origin in order to have substantial information about it.\n \n \nif you are doing an algebraic equation and at the very beginning of the equation you mistakingly place a 2x where a 5y should go, is that equation going to be correct in the end? Probably in your World it would be because you must always be right.\n\n I admit when I'm wrong and when I've made mistakes. (Incidentally, this means that I'd fess up if I quote mined instead of insisting that I only stole from a quote miner, lied about the quote mine, and lied about using the quote mine, pretending that nothing happened while screaming of righteousness and perfection.) But I'm rarely wrong because I don't take positions I can't support.\n \n \nBut in the real World all conclusions based on that one equation with that one error at its foundation will corrupt any end result that comes from that work.\n\n Here, miraculously, your logic is correct. But your application is backward. We came up with the theory based on our observations, such as red shift. The theory is supported by observations like the expanding universe and cosmic microwave background radiation. Your argument would work if we started with the idea of the big bang and used it to produce the \"2x\"s that aren't correct. In reality -- which is worth visiting if ever you get the chance -- we started with observations, which are the correct \"5y\"s, and used them to derive the theory. Lo and behold, the theory agreed with and predicted other \"5y\"s.\n \n \nSo it is with all of the assumptions we make regarding the Age of the Universe,\n\n No assumptions. Derivations based on observations.\n \n \nthe age of the Earth, how old life on Earth is,\n\n Lie. Absolute, outright lie. Radiometric dating isn't at all dependent upon concepts of cosmology.\n \n \nall of these conclusions that you all have stated the ages for more times than my small mind can count are huge unprovable assumptions if just one jot or diddle that scientists used in calculating when the big bang occurred was wrong.\n\n Lie. Suppose God created the universe 5 billion years ago. Nothing prevents this planet from being formed 4.6 billion years ago.\n \n \nAnd since they allow for a gap of billions of years plus or minus in stating the actual age, then it's fair to say they don't actually have a clue in reality.\n\n As \"fair\" as loaded dice and marked decks. A 2% margin of error isn't good enough for you, huh? What's hilarious is that you have been going on and on and on about how evil and dishonest it is of scientists to go around stating precise values for the age of the universe and the age of the earth, so they must be lying. Now you're saying that imprecision is an indicator that they don't know, so they must be lying.\n You lie damn near every time you type anything here, Archie. Now you accuse scientists of not only knowing nothing, but lying about it. Say, Archie, what was that bit about the definition of \"scientific theory\"? Turns out that when I looked it up, it was exactly what I said it was...\n \n \nAnd yet, if someone starts a new thread tomorrow about when the Earth was formed and when life began here, you will post the same numbers you have in the past as if they are facts.\n\n I will, because that's what the very, very, very strong evidence says. You will counter with... well, more nothing, because that's all you've got.\n \n \nAnd if some newbie say's 400 million instead of 4 billion, you will condescendingly correct them as you look down on them like ignorant simpletons.\n\n I'll correct them so that they know what science says.

   "Quoting your posts take up too much bandwidth so I will just quote what is worthy of a response. The first point worth making is that as you attempt to refute and minimize my argument is that you are still speaking in absolutes as if your science is somehow proven and reliable information on all levels. Like how redshift light somehow confirms your version of the big bang absolutely. What you fail to add is that others beside me admit that there are huge questions that remain with the extrapolations made with this information, and many who have questions that Redshift doesn't begin to answer.\n \n My point is that I am making no absolute statements but just showing that many questions remain in the real World of Cosmology, yet in your posts above you say this: AND I POST YOUR WHOLE RESPONSE SO YOU CAN'T SAY I'M RIPPING A STATEMENT OUT OF CONTEXT.\n \n \nHere, miraculously, your logic is correct. But your application is backward. We came up with the theory based on our observations, such as red shift. The theory is supported by observations like the expanding universe and cosmic microwave background radiation. Your argument would work if we started with the idea of the big bang and used it to produce the \"2x\"s that aren't correct. In reality -- which is worth visiting if ever you get the chance -- we started with observations, which are the correct \"5y\"s, and used them to derive the theory. Lo and behold, the theory agreed with and predicted other \"5y\"s.\n\n \n http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/dp5/explode.htm\n  If light from stars or galaxies is passed through a prism or grating, a spectrum is obtained, consisting of a series of lines and bands. These spectra can be used to identify the atomic elements present in the objects concerned, as each element has a distinct spectral \"signature.\" But if we compare the spectral lines of distant galaxies with those produced by the same elements on earth, we find that in every case the lines are displaced towards longer (redder) wavelengths. This is known as the redshift, and is the subject of intense controversy. The majority of astronomers and cosmologists subscribe to the big bang theory, and interpret the redshift to mean that all galaxies are flying apart at high speed and that the universe is expanding. A growing minority of scientists, however, maintains that the redshift is produced by other causes, and that the universe is not expanding. As astronomer Halton Arp remarks in Seeing Red: Redshifts, Cosmology and Academic Science, \"one side must be completely and catastrophically wrong\" [1].\n \n G. de Purucker rejected the theory of an expanding universe or expanding space as \"little short of being a scientific pipe-dream or fairy-tale,\" and suggested that the redshift might be caused by light losing energy during its long voyage through space [2]. This is known as the tired-light theory, and is supported by several astronomers. Paul LaViolette and Tom Van Flandern, for example, have reviewed several observational tests of the different interpretations of the redshift, and conclude that the tired-light, non-expanding-universe model explains the data much better than the expanding-universe hypothesis [3]. To bring the big bang model into line with observations, constant adjustments have to be made to its \"free parameters\" (i.e. fudge factors).\n \n According to the big bang theory, a galaxy's redshift is proportional to its recession velocity, which increases with its distance from earth. In the tired-light model, too, we would expect redshift to be proportional to distance. The fact that this is not always the case shows that other factors must be involved. Numerous examples of galaxies at the same distance having very different redshifts are given in the landmark book Seeing Red by Halton Arp, who works at the Max Planck Institut f\u00fcr Astrophysik in Germany. He also gives many examples of how, for over 30 years, establishment astronomers and cosmologists have systematically tried to ignore, dismiss, ridicule, and suppress this evidence -- for it is fatal to the hypothesis of an expanding universe. Like other opponents of the big bang, he has encountered great difficulties getting articles published in mainstream journals, and his requests for time on ground-based and space telescopes are frequently rejected.\n And this:\n \n http://www.cs.unc.edu/~plaisted/ce/redshift.htmlwe again find an established science in trouble trying to explain the behavior of the natural world. This time the problem is in cosmology, the study of the structure and \"evolution\" of the universe as revealed by its largest physical systems, galaxies and clusters of galaxies. A growing body of observations suggests that one of the most fundamental assumptions of cosmology is wrong.\n \n Most galaxies' spectral lines are shifted toward the red, or longer wavelength, end of the spectrum. Edwin Hubble showed in 1929 that the more distant the galaxy, the larger this \"redshift\". Astronomers traditionally have interpreted the redshift as a Doppler shift induced as the galaxies recede from us within an expanding universe. For that reason, the redshift is usually expressed as a velocity in kilometers per second.\n \n One of the first indications that there might be a problem with this picture came in the early 1970's. William G. Tifft, University of Arizona noticed a curious and unexpected relationship between a galaxy's morphological classification (Hubble type), brightness, and red shift. The galaxies in the Coma Cluster, for example, seemed to arrange themselves along sloping bands in a redshift vs. brightness diagram. Moreover, the spirals tended to have higher redshifts than elliptical galaxies. Clusters other than Coma exhibited the same strange relationships.\n \n By far the most intriguing result of these initial studies was the suggestion that galaxy redshifts take on preferred or \"quantized\" values. First revealed in the Coma Cluster redshift v.s. brightness diagram, it appeared as if redshifts were in some way analogous to the energy levels within atoms.\n \n These discoveries led to the suspicion that a galaxy's redshift may not be related to its Hubble velocity alone. If the redshift is entirely or partially non-Doppler (that is, not due to cosmic expansion), then it could be an intrinsic property of a galaxy, as basic a characteristic as its mass or luminosity. If so, might it truly be quantized?\n \n http://www.biblelife.org/bigbang.htm\n \n Here's another link: points to 12 area's of dispute with the assumptions made. Of course it's a christian source so feel free to ignore the questions asked.\n \n \n http://www.angelfire.com/az/BIGBANGisWRONG/index.html\n \n And here's one that claims the Redshift is due to the Compton effect rather than the Doppler Effect. Surely that little conflict would completely change how Redshift Light is discerned, interpreted and applied to the cosmological effect it is being considered within.\n \n \n So all I am showing here is that there are no absolutes at all and that men of good will with a strong desire to learn the truth either disagree with the current conclusions you promote, or come to completely different conclusions from the same evidence you have posted as somehow proving what you choose to believe.\n \n I know it is very important to attempt to humiliate me by inferring I am ignorant. That isn't my agenda in this debate with you though. I understand that you know and believe that which is a type of religion for you as it explains your origins in your mind. I am simply trying to get you to realize and admit that with so much that we just don't know yet, it is naive and even arrogant to make the presumptions that you make. And you specifically used the word presumption rather than my word assumption above. But it is just as wrong considering the conflicting interpretations within the scientific community regarding the same information. I await your arrogant unprovable presumptions and insults.",

Notice that he also doesn't actually respond to what I was saying about the properties of time, which is the central issue of this topic.\n \n \nThe first point worth making is that as you attempt to refute and minimize my argument is that you are still speaking in absolutes as if your science is somehow proven and reliable information on all levels. Like how redshift light somehow confirms your version of the big bang absolutely.\n\n I never said that redshifts \"confirm\" big bang theory. But it is explained by big bang theory. It therefore supports big bang theory. Let's take another look at what a scientific theory is:\n A theory is an explanation that has been supported by many, many experiments.... A theory states a broad principle of nature that has been supported over time. All theories are still subject to new experimental data and can be modified. ... A theory is considered successful if it can be used to make predictions that are true.\"\n\n So when you say that I have used redshifts as \"absolute\" confirmation, you lie. But we're used to that. What I do say is that the redshift is extremely strong evidence for the big bang. One might go far as to say that the confluence of the evidence makes it so likely that disbelief is illogical.\n \n \nWhat you fail to add is that others beside me admit that there are huge questions that remain with the extrapolations made with this information\n\n ... and wht you've failed to do every time is to ask those questions and show that they are applicable. Merely saying, \"oh, hey, maybe there's this here stuff thingy happening with space-ish timeness and light goes all wonky!\" doesn't cut it.\n \n \nmany who have questions that Redshift doesn't begin to answer.\n\n As shown by these Mickey Mouse pages directed at people who need the redshift explained to them? What's wrong, they can't hold their own when talking to people who are already familiar with astronomy?\n \n \nPaul LaViolette and Tom Van Flandern, for example, have reviewed several observational tests of the different interpretations of the redshift, and conclude that the tired-light, non-expanding-universe model explains the data much better than the expanding-universe hypothesis\n\n Ah, so in order to challenge the big bang theory, these guys simply do away with the law of conservation of energy. The energy of the radiation just magically disappears!\n \n \nNumerous examples of galaxies at the same distance having very different redshifts are given... He also gives many examples of how, for over 30 years, establishment astronomers and cosmologists have systematically tried to ignore, dismiss, ridicule, and suppress this evidence -- for it is fatal to the hypothesis of an expanding universe.\n\n In the same way that biologists \"ignore, dismiss, ridicule, and suppress\" the \"evidence\" for creationism, right? emoticon_rolleyes\n I know off the top of my head that the Andromeda galaxy is actually moving toward us, i.e. it is blueshifted. This sort of information is in no way suppressed, nor does it falsify the big bang theory. There are countless interactions in the universe, and it is as foolish to say that we must assume that every galaxy is moving away from each other galaxy as it is to say that all particles in a diffusing medium cannot possibly collide.\n But then, based on the evidence of your knowledge of the physical sciences (or rather, the lack thereof), I doubt that you understand that analogy.\n \n \nBy far the most intriguing result of these initial studies was the suggestion that galaxy redshifts take on preferred or \"quantized\" values.\n\n Holy spit, Archie, how old are your sources? Yeah, when we were only able to measure a few, redshifts, some of the values seemed incremental. Unsurprisingly, as we got more data, those increments became smaller, and smaller, and smaller yet. With our current data, there's no discernible quantization.\n \n \n[bit about relativity]... A speed near the speed of light is inadequate for mass to escape the tremendous gravitational field at time zero in the Big Bang theory.\n\n Does this guy show the math? Does this guy know what the conditions were less than 10^-43s after expansion began? That'd be pretty impressive, considering people who don't need to be told that 300,000km isn't far is cosmic terms can't figure it out...\n \n \nToday, November 8, 2005, I propose a new theory that the speed of light slows as it travels through the cosmos.\n\n First, this guy's a fraud and a hack. He thinks that he's the first person to think of this as of 2005? Second, he says he has a B.Sc., but he's violating the first law of thermodynamics, which -- fittingly -- IS THE ENTIRE REASON THESE NUTJOBS OBJECT TO THE BIG BANG THEORY IN THE FIRST PLACE.\n This is exactly like the people who explain away evolution by appealing to \"kinds\" during the flood and hyperevolution afterward.\n \n \nHere's another link: points to 12 area's of dispute with the assumptions made. Of course it's a christian source so feel free to ignore the questions asked.\n\n Why would I bother with the other ten? I don't reject it because it's a Christian source, I reject it because it's clearly a complete load of bunk.\n \n \nAnd here's one that claims the Redshift is due to the Compton effect rather than the Doppler Effect.\n\n So light encounters a lot of matter as it travels through the vacuum of space, does it? The light from a specific galaxy gets scattered by exactly the same amount and at exactly the same angles such that we have any image resolution whatsoever? That's even less likely than you actually learning something about physics.\n \n \n Surely that little conflict would completely change how Redshift Light is discerned, interpreted and applied to the cosmological effect it is being considered within.\n\n Sure, if it had any basis in reality.\n \n \nSo all I am showing here is that there are no absolutes at all and that men of good will with a strong desire to learn the truth either disagree with the current conclusions you promote, or come to completely different conclusions from the same evidence you have posted as somehow proving what you choose to believe.\n\n You mean men who -- in most cases -- believe that they already know the truth. They look at these pieces of evidence and twist and contort them in any way they can to present what they think is a convincing argument worthy of presenting to the dumb masses. Find me some sources that are directed at people who actually know something about cosmology, and make sure that these sources don't try to explain away things they don't like by violating the laws of thermodynamics and by proposing that the vacuum of space is laced with particles that stretch wavelengths light without deflecting the photons.\n \n \nI know it is very important to attempt to humiliate me by inferring I am ignorant.\n\n Not important, but it's a fun bonus sometimes.\n \n \nI am simply trying to get you to realize and admit that with so much that we just don't know yet, it is naive and even arrogant to make the presumptions that you make.\n\n They'd be \"presumptions\" if there was no evidence. There is plenty of evidence. The only counterevidence you can predict is this sort of cockamamie nonsense.\n \n \nBut it is just as wrong considering the conflicting interpretations within the scientific community regarding the same information.\n\n \"Conflicting interpretations within the scientific community?\" On the small details, sure, but not for the theory as a whole.

This side tangent on the Big Bang was started as a dodge to answering religious/ bible based questions.\n Maybe if your side would stick to the questions posted in a religious forum you'd have credibility for most of what I've seen are strawmen. \n \n You say there is an infinate God, yet infinate is all inclusive, thus I'd have to be part of God. For you can not say that something is infinate, except for...\n \n Furthermore, you've presented no evidence beyond what's stated previously on the existance of this 'infinate' God. \n God all knowing? Prove it.\n \n If you can't do that relatively simple thing then how can you be trusted to understand science? it seems that you don't. So while you're saying you want to understand, when ever something is explained or presented, you ignore it, deny it or question it like a 4 year old who's only known word is \"Why?\" Seeking a response that suits your own desires.\n \n edit:\n Oh, and you really didn't mention (science) initially when you made this comment:\n \nSo all I am showing here is that there are no absolutes at all and that men of good will with a strong desire to learn the truth either disagree with the current conclusions you promote, or come to completely different conclusions from the same evidence you have posted as somehow proving what you choose to believe.\n\n \n It's a blanket statement.\n Me pointing that out as hypocracy is accurate as it equally applies to anything...there being no 'absolutes  at all\n You later saying it applies to science IS exactly what you accuse others of doing...changing positions and altering comments.\n \n Pendantic?\n Sure...but, at time, so are you.",

You guys do this every time I raise an issue you don't want to deal with because you know my questions are valid.\n\n \n \n \nThe definition I gave say's the same thing. A theory is not a proven fact as of yet. The only reason gravity is still considered a theory has nothing to do with an apple dropping from a tree and hitting the ground because we all understand that aspect of gravitational pull. But how does gravity effect light, air, the atmosphere and Space? Studies are still going on to answer those questions.\n\n \n This all boils down to the fact that you haven't read the theory of General Relativity, haven't even found out how the speed of light was found to be CONSTANT and was described as THE Universal Constant (c) by A. Einstein in the above mentioned paper. ie, you haven't done your homework and thus, presumably don't know when you're talking obvious cobblers.\n Do yourself (and the internet community at large) a favour and read the original work, find out the background and stop trying to tell us that things you don't know about are somehow uncertain. \n Gravity is a distortion of Space-Time, this affects light as it bends around the distortion, not slow down, not speed up, speed of light in vacuum is constant.\n The atmosphere (composed of air) is held close to surface of a planet by Gravity because is requires energy to escape the Space-Time distortion. This is described as Escape Velocity.",

   "Once again you show why it's a waste of time trying to have a rational and reasonable debate with you\n\n A rational and reasonable debate would see you acknowledging that I actually address your points instead of pretending that I didn't. A rational and reasonable debate use our complete knowledge of science, not cherry-picked tidbits and selective ignorance of contradicting concepts.\n \n \nwhere issues are discussed rather than insults and unsupportable opinions.\n\n Then stop bringing the insults and unsupportable opinions. You can pretend to take offense all you want, but your habit of calling me a \"sanctimonious putz\" pretty much stick you with the label so much like my favorite ion, ClO-.\n \n \nYour sanctimonious and superior condescension toward my legitimate questions with legitimate links to support them,\n\n Look how you go out of the way to call bible-thumpers.scientific-ignoramus.org a \"legitimate link.\" Even you know that it's pathetic. Find me a paper in Science.\n \n \n... your opinion ... is supported by nothing more than your over inflated ego\n\n And all that pesky evidence.\n \n \nI didn't attack you or insult you in my post but that is all you have done in yours.\n\n So when you lie, like you have in the above quote, and I call you a liar, that's an attack/insult? If you don't want to be called a liar, stop lying. I addressed several of your \"arguments,\" even the absurdly dumb ones that nobody with even a rudimentary understanding of physics would respect.\n \n \nAnd that is because you can't refute the fact that there are many different ways to interpret the information that Cosmology and Quantum Mechanics learns.\n\n I can't refute that there are many ways to interpret some of the information. What I dispute is that all the information can be interpreted in the way that you want it to be interpreted. You want random Compton scattering to cause a wavelength increase; well, sure, Compton scattering does that. You want it to happen in the vacuum of space; that is, you want radiation-matter interaction where there is no matter. You want this matterless radiation-matter interaction to occur in a way that we see a continuous stream of particles such that our resolution of the images is superb even though Compton scattering would make the probability of such so astronomical that it couldn't begin to be calculated. You want this impossible interaction leading to an absurdly improbable confluence of radiation trajectory after precisely the amount of random impossible interactions to produce the observation of the same redshift every time.\n \n And that was the more compelling argument.\n \n \nThat is the only point I am attempting to make here and rather than admit that very obvious fact, you would rather attack and insult me as you wallow in your ignorant denial of the fact that it will take hundreds, if not thousands of years of exploration and learning about the Universe before we can even hope to understand when or even IF the big bang was a real event as it is defined today.\n\n Let me preface my next statement by saying that I disagree with your premise that we don't have enough information to make a reasonable conclusion. The neat thing about the universe is that it is big. When we look into space, we look into the past. In a sense, we can do millions, billions of years of exploration right now.\n My main response to this bit, though, is that you'd rather say, \"Hey, I don't really like how this information doesn't really fit with my superstition, so I insist that we withhold judgement and act as if we don't know a damn thing.\"\n \n \nAnd here's another stupid question to lump in with your imaginary science\n\n Again, your inability to comprehend doesn't make it imaginary.\n \n \nhow do you explain that there are potentially as many Universes in all of Time and Space as there are known Galaxy's and Solar Systems in this one Universe.\n\n I don't explain it. I don't need to, at least not for this discussion. Whether there are eleventy bajillion other universes doesn't change the observations we've made in ours.\n \n \nThat is actually a true definition of Eternity. Time without end; get to the end of this Universe and another one is beginning, ad infinitum. Now how does that reality mesh with your big bang theory which scientist view as a complete event in and of itself within this Universe alone?\n\n I can \"define\" an invisible pink unicorn, or a flying spaghetti monster, so does that make IPU (mhhhnbs) or FSM exist? Saying that you have a definition of \"eternity\" and implying that I must incorporate it into a worldview is nonsensical.\n \n \nSo as you insisted how ignorant I am above while never even considering that our Universe may be nothing more than 1 in billions of Universes just shows that you are the ignorant sightless pygmy in the realm of Quantum Mechanics and Cosmology.\n\n And I \"may be\" a figment of your imagination. For all you know, you're a brain in a vat. But you don't believe this because there's no evidence for it. Does that make you an ignorant, sightless pygmy?\n Nowhere did I say that I refuse to consider that there are realms other than our universe. But we're talking about this one.\n What I especially love is how you admit that you don't know much about QM or cosmology, I've lectured you on quantized redshifts and the Compton effect, yet here you are calling me ignorant of each because of a tidbit you simply made up.\n \n You truly have no grasp on reality.\n \n \nI have never doubted, ever, that there are an uncountable number of Universes of which we are just one. To me, it has always just gone without saying it is so obvious. And here is some evidence that science is finally grasping this belief in support of my contention.\n\n So what you're admitting here is that you've been clinging to this belief despite no real evidence for it. You make a habit of that, don't you?\n Here's what's absolutely hysterical: the reasoning behind the idea is based on.... you guessed it: Big Bang theory. Throw out BBT, and there's no reason at all -- even less that this already flimsy idea -- to believe in multiverses.\n Seriously, did you even read the thing?",

   "And since we're being so candid, neither do any links you might post someday which also have an agenda.\n\n Ooh, pre-impeachment. Archie just \"knows\" that whatever sources I post will be useless. In other words, Archie will never believe me. Nothing I can say or do will change his mind because he has already concluded that he will not listen to what I say.\n \n \nIf my links like space.com are all useless for evidence to even raise valid questions, then surely your links are useless for offering answers.\n\n You had one -- count it, one -- link to space.com, and you posted only after I'd ripped your bible-thumpers.r.us pages to shreds. Hilarity ensued, because it was based on the acceptance of big bang theory.\n Archie boy, you produced a handful of sophomoric, pathetically undereducated arguments against the big bang, and I presented explanations of why they were wrong. YOU DIDN'T RESPOND TO A SINGLE COUNTERARGUMENT. You can't show that any of my statements are false. You can't show that any of my reasoning is flawed. All you can do is call me unreasonable, rant and rave about how I don't treat you like a little kid who needs pampering, and call me close-minded because of a position you claim I hold yet do not.\n Not that I feel the need to defend myself to other people, but I'd rather just make the point to show others that Archie really is off his rocker: Archie accuses me of not knowing about quantum mechanics and refusing to consider multiverses. But I'm well aware of the many-worlds interpretation that stems from QM. And -- frankly -- just by saying this, it shows that I know way more than Archie will ever understand.\n \n \nSo thanks for showing once and for all that it is a waste attempting to actually debate you on any level of intelligence at all.\n\n I agree that it's a waste. You clearly don't have the intellectual wherewithal to present any semblance of a reasonable position, let alone back up one of your unreasonable ones. You got your XXX kicked, ran crying to Zardoz because ol' 'lectrolyte's such a meanie, and even before he could tell it like it is, you're running away. Again.\n \n \nI'm through wasting my time with you lyte, and good riddance.\n\n I'm not going anywhere. If you want to keep posting here, feel free, but I'll roast it all the same.",

It's not even funny anymore. \n \n \nAnd show me the contract we signed that placed you in charge of releasing people from debates? How incredibly sanctimonious and pompous you people are to judge a person for refusing to debate the lies you put forth. \n \n\n \n Name me one lie.

Everyone came to the same conclusion that you use the threat of Hell when you are losing. The only person who thought you weren't was you. How can it be that a large number of people, independently reading it, some with no real contact with you all came to the same conclusion?

   "Hey Zardoz, just to show you have at least one objective bone in your body, try reading lytes response to me that preceded that statement of mine you are quoting and count the insults and attacks on my intelligence in that one post. Now go to the post before his response from me, the one with the red and blue type, and see how I didn't get personal with him. I just anticipated his continued attacks on my intelligence, which is par for the course with him. But evidently you have a real blind spot to all of the attacks I get in any given day by you hate mongers. But like typical bullies you cry like little babies when I give it back to you. emoticon_cry Now go blow your nose, your dripping all over the keyboard.\n\n \n \n \nYou see lyte, this is the kind of irrational claptrap that you post with such pride that proves you don't have the brains of a newborn.\n\n \n Sorry, I just don't get where you insult someone (even if being insulted too) as a precidence and then, for ONE post, don't, that you can play saint as say you don't insult...\n \n And it is right that you should anticipate attacks on your intelligence when dealing with many things. Time and again you get a lot wrong. Even from your own instruction manuel.\n \n \n But, I guess we do twist facts...\n \n \n\n FACT: Bears Eat Beets.\n Bears\n Beets \n Battle Star Galactica\n\n \n That was All I gould get out of old BB when I interviewed him via the Invisible Pink Unicorn.",
