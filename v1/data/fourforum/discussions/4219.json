   "Maybe this will be helpful in boosting your understanding of the issue.\n This list is from the Human Rights Campaign:\n \n Top 10 Reasons for Marriage Equality\n 10. Marriage equality would build on America's tradition of moving civil rights forward and erasing the inequities of the past. More than 10 nations already allow same-sex couples to get married or to enter federally recognized domestic partnerships. What's more, the fact that excluding same-sex couples from marriage has a long history in this country doesn't necessarily mean that this policy is in keeping with American values. The real tradition in this country has been to pass laws to safeguard the American people and to expand laws where they leave citizens unprotected, as was done for voting rights and workplace protections. It is also an American tradition to abandon discriminatory laws, even if they are popular - as were bans on interracial marriage and Jim Crow laws segregating the races in everyday life.\n \n 9. Marriage protects couples nationwide. Unlike civil unions and domestic partner registries, which aren't portable, marriages are recognized across state lines, under the Constitution's full faith and credit clause. If the question of recognition is left to the states, same-sex couples in some states might not achieve equality for decades. After all, it wasn't until 2000 that Alabama voters removed laws against interracial marriage from the state constitution - and that was with a solid 40 percent voting to keep the law on the books.\n \n 8. Separate is not equal. Although any step toward legal recognition of same-sex couples and their families is a step in the right direction, GLBT families will not be truly equal until they, too, can receive marriage licenses. As American history has proven, a separate but equal system does not ensure real equality. And nothing short of marriage would provide same-sex couples with the more than 1,000 benefits, responsibilities and protections afforded under federal law on the basis of marital status.\n \n 7. Public support is growing. The Human Rights Campaign released results in August 2003 from a poll (conducted by the Democratic polling firm of Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Republican firm American Viewpoint) showing that 50 percent of registered voters support or accept granting marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples as long as religious institutions do not have to recognize or perform these marriages. A total of 47 percent were opposed. There is no consensus in this country around denying the legal protections of marriage to same-sex couples. In fact, polls show us that a plurality of voters support or accept granting marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples. And, according to a Sept. 22, 2003, ABC News survey, only 20 percent would agree with amending the U.S. Constitution to ban marriage for gays and lesbians.\n \n 6. GLBT people deserve equal access to the American dream. Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people grow up dreaming of falling in love, getting married and growing old together. Just as much as the next person, same-sex couples should be able to fulfill that dream. We know from anecdotal evidence that after same-sex couples have a commitment ceremony, their friends and family treat them differently - as a married couple. Shouldn't they, too, have the legal security that goes along with that?\n \n 5. Marriage provides families stability and security. One thing that both sides of the marriage issue can agree upon is that marriage strengthens families. Children are more secure if they are raised in homes with two loving parents who have a legal relationship with them and can share the responsibility of parenthood. According to conservative estimates from the 2000 census, there are more than 1 million children being raised by same-sex couples in the United States. Without the ability to establish a legal relationship to both parents, children of same-sex couples are left without important protections, such as Social Security survivor benefits. These children should not be penalized just because their parents are gay.\n \n 4. There are hundreds of ways in which state laws take marital status into account, including some of the most basic of human rights. State laws protect married couples in extremely important ways, such as allowing hospital visitation, the right to inherit without a will and the right to make decisions in a medical emergency. Some of these can be secured through costly legal documents, but not all of them can. Furthermore, same-sex couples - who pay the same taxes and work just as hard as other couples - should not be forced to pay higher taxes and high legal fees just because of whom they love.\n \n 3. The Constitution promises liberty and justice to all Americans, not just the majority. Opponents of marriage equality are pushing a divisive measure that would amend the U.S. Constitution to state that marriage \"shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman.\" The Constitution has been used throughout American history to ensure, protect and expand the individual liberties of Americans. It has never been amended to single out a class of people for unequal treatment, but it has been amended to grant freedom of speech, religious liberty and voting rights for women. The Constitution should secure equality, not restrict it.\n \n 2. No religious institution would be required to perform a ceremony. Just as no religious institution can be required by the government to marry an interfaith couple, no religious institution could or should be told to marry a same-sex couple. Right now, the government fails to ensure religious freedom when it refuses to honor the unions of same-sex couples performed by one religion the same way it honors those of opposite-sex couples.\n \n 1. There are at least 1,049 protections, benefits and responsibilities extended to married couples under federal law, according to a 1997 study by the General Accounting Office. Gay and lesbian couples in lifelong relationships pay higher taxes and are denied basic protections under the law. They receive no Social Security survivor benefits upon the death of a partner, despite paying payroll taxes. They must pay federal income taxes on their employer's contributions toward their domestic partner's health insurance, while married employees do not have to pay such taxes for their spouses. They must pay all estate taxes when a partner dies. They often pay significant tax penalties when they inherit a 401(k) from their partner. They are denied family leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. All American families deserve these crucial protections",

The problem is that you want a right over and above that--special rights.\n \n \nMarriage protects couples nationwide.

One thing that both sides of the marriage issue can agree upon is that marriage strengthens families. Children are more secure if they are raised in homes with two loving parents who have a legal relationship with them and can share the responsibility of parenthood.\n\n \n You seem to think that a legal document somehow give a commitment between two people legitimacy. Marriage strengthens families because it is a commitment that hoepfully is kept. The ONLY think in question here is the govt.'s recognition of marriage, not marriage itself. You can already have the strength of marriage if you want to commit to someone. Let's not confuse the two. There is nothing magical about a state-issued marriage license. It's simply a legal paper--it won't give you stability to your home and family. You'll have to do that yourself.\n \n \nThere are hundreds of ways in which state laws take marital status into account,\n\n \n And these can be extended to portable civil unions.\n \n \nThe Constitution promises liberty and justice to all Americans, not just the majority.\n\n \n That doesn't mean you get absolutely anything you want, anymore than someone wanting social security monies at 25, for instance.

(a carryover from an earlier part of our history when this was an issue)\n \n Furthermore, many items in the list are very general, which could be taken to apply to one instance, or many. Some apply to outdated laws which aren't even applicable any longer. The document itself says that it is \"a collection of 1049 federal laws classified to the United States code in which marital status is a factor.\" It does not even call them actual 'benefits.' Gay rights groups have tried to portray ALL these as benefits. But as the GAO document itself says \"no conclusion can be drawn, from our identification of a law as one in which marital status is a factor, concerning the effect of the law on married people versus single people.\" Funny isn't it, how gay rights groups tend to leave that part out when they quote the document.\n \n Coscura, see the GAO document itself, if you want to make your own judgements:\n \n http://www.marriageequality.org/1049.pdf\n \n It's a PDF, so you have to have Acrobat Reader to read it.",

   "gay marriage: isn't one of the main points of being gay, besides the 'i was born this way'-ism kind of a way to tell convention to go shove it?\n\n \n Well, the simple answer to this question is \"No it is not.\" Telling convention to shove it is not one of the main points of being gay, not in any way shape or form. Being gay is simply about the people one is attracted to, the people one loves, and the person one wants to spend his or her life with.\n \n Now this does not mean that these people do not tell convention to go shove it, but they do so only when they believe convention is unfair, unjust, unequal, and a detriment to happiness. On the issue of gay rights, most (but maybe not all) gay people believe that the specific convention of denying some rights to gay people is a bad one, so they stand against it. They do not simply hate convention because it is convention; good convention is worth retaining.\n \n \nas far as i'm concerned, marriage is simply a way of providing a stable home life for children, thus giving them a better chance of succeeding outside the home. and it doesn't always work! look at the divorce rates- whats the average marriage length now, two or three years? while we're on it, why are you fighting for state sanctions anyway? is it tax benefits or something?\n\n \n Marriage does many good things, including providing financials relief and expanding health care and other benefits. This helps out the members of a marriage when one of them falls ill or is laid off and needs help to get through a tough situation. It also encourage the family unit, which provides emotional support.\n \n I do believe that children are an important reason behind marriage as well. However, quite a few, if not most, long-duration same-sex couples have children, and allowing them to marry would give them a much better chance at adoption, which would further increase their likelyhood to have children. Because same-sex couples can have children and have the same needs as any other family, they deserve the same marriage benefits provided to opposite-sex couples.\n \n So is it the tax benefits? Yes, sort of. It is that same-sex couples are in the same financial situation and hold the same family structure as opposite-sex couples. It is unfair to give special benefits to opposite-sex couples; they have no special need for these benefits that does not apply to same-sex couples.\n \n \ni simply can't understand this, and its driving me up the wall! so far i've seen you guys (and girls, or whatever you would prefer that i refer to you as) say 'to hell with the system! we're outside it, we don't need it!' and then you turn around and say 'we want back in! give us this this and this, or we'll have gay pride parades and march on washington!'\n\n \n If this is what you've seen, then you've misinterpreted. I don't know any gay people who really believe that \"the system\" needs to be torn down or removed. They may think that they are outside of the system, but this is certainly not due to their own intentions. Their goal is to change the system to give themselves a place in it, a place equal to that of any other.\n \n And what is it you think of gay pride parades? It does not sound to me that you equate these to the civil rights marches of the past, though civil rights marches is exactly what these things are. Surely you would not have condemned the African American marches on Washington when African Americans fought for equality, so why look down on the marches of today?\n \n \nclaiming to be 'just like me' detracts from that argument. claiming to be 'just like everyone else' would work, and i'll assume you meant something like that (if you want to know why, read some of my other posts). this also goes against roughly 1/3rd of the philosiphies of the gay couples i know and commonly associate with- those philosiphies being 'hey! sex is for pleasure, and if you're trying to avoid having kids the best way is to **** the same sex as yourself!'\n\n \n Well, I would not make the claim that anyone is just like anyone else, but I would make the claim that gay people are just as likely to be good people as anyone else. Now, I would wager that I know far more gay people than you do. I wager this only because I am in a variety of gay rights organizations, as well as other gay-friendly organizations. I also have many gay friends outside of these organizations. I know of none being sexually promiscuous, though perhaps some are doing it behind my back. I know of many who do believe that sex is for pleasure, but an equal, if not greater percentage of heterosexuals who also believe sex should be used for pleasure. Further, I know a number of very promiscuous heterosexuals.\n \n Yet we let those heterosexuals marry. In truth, I see no reason not to. Lots of people of all sexual orientations believe that sex should be used for pleasure, not just children. This fact is a religious / moral belief, and it does not make these people bad parents, nor does it make these people bad people, nor does it make these people less in need of the benefits of marriage should they decide to start a family. If we are going to give marriage to some people, it is inexcusable to deny that marriage to others who are in equal need of it.\n \n If you would like others to respect your status as a husband (or wife, or whatever you would prefer that I refer to you as), then you must be willing to respect the marriage of others in return.",

   "gay marriage: isn't one of the main points of being gay, besides the 'i was born this way'-ism kind of a way to tell convention to go shove it? \n\n \n Not at all. Not as far as I'm concerned. Maybe for some, propably very few, gays and lesbians actually want to \"tell convention to shove it.\" The problem is with the mindset you are displaying. You may not believe gays are \"born that way\" and therefor you see it as a form of \"non-conformity.\" To me, I was born this way. Just as I was born being left-handed and blue eyed. I didn't choose any of those things. But traditionally being left handed was thought to be simply a behavior, something which could be changed through cruel correction. Being blue eyed is physically a detriment because those with blue eyes are far more light sensitive. I was also born gay. I didn't choose it and although I did try to change it, I later realized it cannot be changed. \n \n \n \nas far as i'm concerned, marriage is simply a way of providing a stable home life for children, thus giving them a better chance of succeeding outside the home. and it doesn't always work!\n\n \n \n Really? So why do the elderly marry? Why do those who know they can never convieve children marry? Why do those who actively refuse to have children marry? \n Marriage is in no way \"simply a way of providing a stable home life for children\" at all. Marriage, today, is for compainionship and love.\n \n \n look at the divorce rates- whats the average marriage length now, two or three years?\n\n \n Who's marriages? Opposite gender marriages. Because same gender couples cannot marry you can in NO way compair the two. \n \n \n while we're on it, why are you fighting for state sanctions anyway? is it tax benefits or something?\n \n \n Sometimes yes. Sometimes no. Although there is no denying the obvious tax advantages to marriage, there are other aspects of which you blatently close your eyes to. How's about respect for one? \n \n \n \ni simply can't understand this, and its driving me up the wall! so far i've seen you guys (and girls, or whatever you would prefer that i refer to you as) say 'to hell with the system! we're outside it, we don't need it!' and then you turn around and say 'we want back in! give us this this and this, or we'll have gay pride parades and march on washington!'\n \n\n \n Again, it's your perspective. Let's pretend for a while, shall we? \n Let's pretend the laws still did not allow interracial marriage and you want to marry someone outside your race. Is this fair? Why would you want to marry outside your race? Would it be for the tax breaks? If so, why not just marry someone of your own race? Why do you have to be allowed to marry someone of another race? Why can't you just stick to your own? \n \n Allow me to answer...\n You want to marry the person you love. Pure and simple. You want to legally be recognized as married when you register your children for school. \n \n You want to be recognized as legally married if you or your loved one should ever be hospitalized and cannot make medical decissions for yourself. \n \n You want to be recognized as legally married when you or your loved one retires and you are of age to obtain Social Security benefits. \n \n You want to be recognized as legally married when you grow old and need the aid of an assisted living center and so you and your loved one can still live together. \n \n You want to be legally recognized if anything should happen to your or your loved one so that when your (as a couple) estate is divided, someone else in your extended families cannot take off with the home you two built together. \n \n You want to be legally recognized as married so that if your or your loved one need medical insurence coverage you aren't paying for two seperate individual coverages. \n \n You want to be legally recognized as married so that if anything should happen to you or your loved one, the chidlren you raised together (even if they are from a former relationship or adopted) aren't stripped from you thus tearing your heart and your family in pieces. \n \n \nwould somebody care to explain this to me so i can go about my life in a slightly more politically correct manner? :)\n\n \n Oh get off it.

No one's claiming \"anything you want.\" They are claiming equal facilities, which, due to biology and psychology, aren't accessible (allow so harms no one and violates the rights of no others).\n \n \n marriage has other important functions? like what? i'm not going by what anyone has told me, i'm going by what i see: men typically marry for steady *****, women typically marry because they want kids (eventually counts) or they want someone else to come home to and don't mind the side effect of kids. and as for gays harming children? people who make claims like that are people i generally ignore, if not go out of my way to provoke.\n\n \n I usually ignore XXXXXX like you, but I'll make an exception, because the illogic of your posts is fun to exploit; it's like a day and disneyworld. Your view of marriage is based on a black/white fallacy, your caricature of gays is hilarious, and you fallaciously link gays to people who harm children, which is a glittering generality.\n \n \n claiming to be 'just like me' detracts from that argument. claiming to be 'just like everyone else' would work, and i'll assume you meant something like that (if you want to know why, read some of my other posts). this also goes against roughly 1/3rd of the philosiphies of the gay couples i know and commonly associate with- those philosiphies being 'hey! sex is for pleasure, and if you're trying to avoid having kids the best way is to **** the same sex as yourself!'\n \n thank you for replying, even if you haven't (entirely) cleared up any of the questions i've asked.\n\n \n Philosophy? Secondarily, you are again making a mockery of all gay people with your inane strawman, stating that their primary focus is sex and partying, which simply isn't true. You might as well condemn all college students with that attitude. That is characteristic of a certain percentage, and your \"personal\" account of this is worthless. Why?

   "I think social security is a very applicable analogy--when the govt. gives SS money to one group (those 62 and over) and doesn't give it to another, it is discriminating based on age.\n\n \n And what is the rational logic behind the justified \"discrimination?\" Do you expect to pay with money you cannot afford? There is objective reasoning and moral calculus behind not given 25 year olds SS benefits, there is no logical calculus behind anti gay marraige, except biblical nonsense.\n \n \n \n\n There is no guarantee that any given 25 year old will make it to 62, and if gay people can expect marraige benefits for gay marriages, I don't see why younger people couldn't expect the benefits older people get.\n\n \n Because the government cannot afford to give everyone who's 25 the benefits of SOCIAL security, which is meant for retirement age individuals. Everyoen who gets to that age will get it, if the system doesn't collapse first due to lack of money.\n \n Gays can never marry homosexual people, and it's not morally right to force them to only marry heterosexuals, because it's not biologically or mentally sound, and the former does no harm to anyone. There's no marginal harm.\n \n \n\n The point is that you don't get to have discrimination ended just because you say so.\n\n \n No one's saying that. Discrimination is sometimes warrented if it does objective damage or there are real risks. FOr example, higher insurance rates for smokers! They are more of a danger! High insurance rates for young male teenagers! Not allowing children to smoke under 18! Not allowing 40 year old men to have sex with 4 year old girls! There has to be an age cut off somewhere due to some objective reason. All of these \"discriminations\" have valid, objective reasons for them. The relgious objection to gay marriage and the mythical idea of a sacred cow institution does not serve as a valid, objective reason.\n \n Your subjective religion is trumped by rational, objective reasons.\n \n \n\n If that weren't true, SS benefits might already be given to all age groups. Does the constitution guarantee that a 25 year old can cash in on SS benefits? No more than it does for gay people to cash in on straight marriage benefits, and vice versa.\n\n \n When the 25 year old reaches retirement, yes. THe gay is never gauranteed to marry someone of his choosing, barring legal age.\n \n No it doesn't, because SS isn't a right, but equal treatment is. Everyone WILL get social security, if it survives, unless they die first. You can't realistically have a gay married to a non-gay. There's no chemistry, no love, and it's mentally wrong forcing someone to do that or have nothing as an alternative.\n \n You cannot compare SS to marriage benefits. The former everyone will get barring collapse or death, regardless of race, gender, or orientation. The other only one group gets, and no one else has the possibility. That's like saying, again, africans have the right to marry only other africans, not whites. They still have the right to self-determination though! Just not with whites! And that's due to a mythical cultural definition of marriage.\n \n \n \n\n Careful; gay rights people expect others to take them at their word all the time.\n \n Some people say that. They can be ignored.\n \n \"It's natural because I'm gay, and I SAY it feels this way!\"\n\n \n nah. It's natural because of studies from almost every major health organiation as well as zoological studies, not because someone say's so.\n \n \n \n what the hell are you talking about? i cited the philosiphies of exactly seven gay people that i know. do you really think this affects all of you? if your really that worried about it, doesn't that place some concern where it shouldn't be? and on a lighter note, i will condemn all college students with that attitude, until i meet a notable exception (i'm in college and that may take a while. i could also include the professors if you're worried about equality).\n\n \n 1. No one knows any of these people, and your anecdote can be complete fabricated, and no one would know otherwise.

   "gay marriage: isn't one of the main points of being gay, besides the 'i was born this way'-ism kind of a way to tell convention to go shove it? as far as i'm concerned, marriage is simply a way of providing a stable home life for children, thus giving them a better chance of succeeding outside the home. and it doesn't always work! look at the divorce rates- whats the average marriage length now, two or three years? while we're on it, why are you fighting for state sanctions anyway? is it tax benefits or something?\n \n i simply can't understand this, and its driving me up the wall! so far i've seen you guys (and girls, or whatever you would prefer that i refer to you as) say 'to hell with the system! we're outside it, we don't need it!' and then you turn around and say 'we want back in! give us this this and this, or we'll have gay pride parades and march on washington!'\n \n would somebody care to explain this to me so i can go about my life in a slightly more politically correct manner? :)\n\n \n I'm not sure what has you bugged. Would gay people being allowed to have the same legally recognized marriages that straight people have affect you in any way?",

   "Well, there are a lot of gay people who would disagree with you since they got married without the possibility of a license.\n \n I think you are referring to civil marriage. In my opinion commitment marriage is a marriage depending on what the couple wants it to be. If they want to call it a marriage, that's their business, and none of yours to question. Regarding this issue, you should take your own tagline to heart.\n\n Civil marriage is what the debate is about. Stop talking out of both sides of your mouth.

   "its not just you, i've gotten this response from several people, and its not a point i'm interested in hearing about. its been getting me called all sorts of names by many different people. but to answer your question, no, i havent seen a satisfactory answer yet. claiming that its unfair to not have marriage when so many marriages end so miserably points to some bizarre form of masochism, in my mind. the cases where i've seen marriages work out are few and far between, and in many cases have more to do with economic support than with love or affection. thats why i've been asking: because even though i don't have any stake in this, it still baffles me. does that make more sense?\n\n \n I understand more now, I think. The reason so many want marriage is probaby not because they believe it will make their relationships last forever. But people who are going to break up will do so whether the government recognizes their relationship or not. And those break ups will be just as hard and traumatic for a couple who has declared themselves life partners as it would be for a couple whose life partnership is recognized by the government. The debate over marriage rests in idea that it is not only wrong for the government to grant recognition to some relationships but not others, it is wrong for the government to grant benefits to some relationships but not others. Same-sex couples are as deserving and in need of benefits and recognition as anyone else, and there is no reason to recognize one relationship over another simply because of the gender of the people involved.\n \n \nwould it make you feel better if i told you i refrain from voting? i honestly don't believe in it- its simply too easy to rig, as gwb's first term in office taught us. and i also don't see how banning gay marriage is a greatly immoral act, for the reasons stated above: marriage is great while it lasts but hell afterwards for nearly everyone involved, in most cases: why do you want to put yourself or somebody you love through that? if it makes you feel better, i'm in most cases against hetero marriages- they don't last, everybody gets heartbroken, so on etc.\n\n \n Whether you believe in voting or not, it is still a worthwhile cause to work toward equality under the law. Although you may not believe marriage is a good thing in many cases, surely you agree that our current definition of marriage does not treat same-sex couples fairly and justly under the law. When faced with such injustice, working against it is an important task; injustice is not something which should be allowed to stand unchallenged.\n \n \nooOOooh! you dare make ambiguous jabs about who i am as a person! fine, if you think i'm so evil condemn me, and if its true i'll admit to it- but the majority of what you just accused me of is simply a detached view of what most people would do anyway. if i bring them to tears, i don't laugh at them- i'm not a bully, or at least i try not to be- i try to show them why i think they're wrong and why it wasn't a good idea to get so emotionally attached to an idea in the first place. i'd make karl marx cry if i showed him what happened to the soviet republics and communism, to get the point across that it doesn't work anywhere but on paper. that doesn't mean i point and laugh- just the opposite- i'd try to comfort him and profess the respect i have for his ideas and the hopes that they could somehow/someday work. does that seem immoral? as for condemning others for their actions and emotions, if i've been interpreted as doing so i- again- have to profoundly apologize. all i've done is asked for an explanation, and persisted in asking for one when no reasonable answers were forthcoming.\n\n \n I don't think you're so evil; I'm certain you have good intentions. I was also not certain that you quite meant to word that the way you did. I do not find it immoral to have a discussion with people, even though that discussion may hurt them emotionally. But I do find it immoral to pay no mind to whether someone is hurt emotionally, and I do find it immoral to not care that someone was hurt emotionally. That is the impression what you wrote gave me, whether it was intended or not. I did not mean to imply that you have actually harmed anyone emotionally, though you seemed to say that you would not care if you did. I get the impression now that you do actually care about hurting people emotionally.\n \n Regarding Marx's ideas, well they would certainly be a great thing if they could work. Perhaps in time we will see a society make those ideas work, but I'm not so certain human nature wouldn't tend to abuse those principles too much. We will see, I suppose.",

   "It would seem to me that government ought to stay out of marriage altogether. It has historically been a religious ceremony (whatever your religion).\n\n \n In many cultures, this is true. In our Western tradition, it is not. Legal, civil marriage is based on ROMAN law. Roman law, in this area, was independent of any particular religious tradition. Early Christian thinkers counselled AGAINST marriage, as an impediment to personal dedication to God. It took a few centuries before Christianity first recognized, then co-opted, the marriage ceremony. Not coincidentally, it did so once it was strong enough to control it. And even while it controlled it, the Church often (but not always) found a way to conduct some marriages (non-Christian ones) in a way that was considered LEGAL but not SACRED.\n \n Odd that some* modern day Christians can't grasp a distinction their ancestors could...\n \n * I am going to try to put \"some\" into all my posts until you come up with that codeword I asked for.\n \n \nIf people want to enter into partnerships, I don't see any laws preventing that. \n\n \n Visit the laws of the State of Virginia. Gay people are BANNED from entering into any legal partnership or contract that in any way mimicks legal marriage.",

They might do so with family and friends. They might do so only in the gay community, where everyone knows what they mean.\n \n If they say it on a government form, it's fraud.

The terms you use are precisely intollerant of one who's beliefs are different from yours. \n\n \n You are wrong about the intolerance. I am not intolerant of others whose beliefs are different. As a citizen, I have no option to restrict their rights. I must tolerate them. I must accept them. I believe in what the Constitution says is our legal framework. Furthermore, I celebrate them. I believe strongly in people maintaining their cultural traditions but NOT BY IMPOSING THEM ON EVERYONE. I respect and admire many orthodox communities of a variety of religions, even though they may be rabidly anti-gay, AS LONG AS SOCIETY AS A WHOLE PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE for those who do not share the beliefs.\n \n All I am looking for a shorthand term that does not take up a page with all its qualifications that I can use when I need to refer to that SUBGROUP of religious folk who use their religious faith (genuine or otherwise) to prevent my full participation in the legal rights this country guarantees to its citizens. Actually, two terms might be useful: one for the sincere; one for the hypocrits.\n \n I'm not asking for a word to describe any particular religious faith. I'm asking for an acceptable term -- acceptable to YOU -- to describe the subgroup. I clearly can't say \"Christian\" (and I don't) as many, many Christians do NOT object to gay rights. I can't say \"fundamentalists\" (even though most of the folks who fall into the category I mean call themselves that and hardly anyone complains about it) for the same reason. I can't say \"Southern Baptists\", to some degree for the same reason but also because I'd have to make a list to include some Mormons, some Catholics, some Muslims, etc. etc.\n \n \nAs to your comments on Roman law, marriage has been around long before the romans, long before states mandated it.

You said \"It has historically been a religious ceremony (whatever your religion).\"\n \n That is disingenuous. It has been a religious ceremony and it HAS NOT BEEN a religious ceremony.

   "As I stated, your point is well taken. Also, it is not a matter of approval or disapproval. It is a matter of logic and a persuasive argument. It is not logical to argue in that manner as it only points to the opposite. It is not persuasive for the same reason.\n \n edit: Essentially it is argumentum ad hominem. A logical fallacy.\n\n \n I would agree that using such terms destroy persuasive value, but this is because when attacked, the person being argued against immediately becomes defensive and protects themselves from an insult. The person who uses such terms seems like a jerk, and when viewed as a jerk, that person cannot be convincing.\n \n But this is not really ad hominem. Although those insults were used, they were not used as reasoning behind an argument, just as a side note. An example of ad hominem might be \"your argument against same-sex marriage is invalid because you are uneducated\" or \"why should I listen to you? You're gay.\" Those are using an attack on a person as the reason that their arguments are incorrect. It is certainly possible to make a logical argument, then tack on as a side note that one's opponent is a wacko without commiting a logical fallacy.",

The specifics are listed in this study, which we quoted in another thread:\n \n http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=5559&sequence=0\n \n I believe that this study also does not factor in that more same-sex couples will be able and willing to adopt, should their marriage be legalized, which indicates that less children will be raised by taxpayer-funded adoption homes and more will be raised by families.\n \n So I think your claim that liberals are saying \"give our gay couples those scraps of paper the other couples have and let them keep most of their money\" is based only on the assumption that allowing these marriages is somehow an increase in government spending. It is not; this debate is not at all about government spending. This debate is about giving the same set of rights and benefits to same-sex couples that opposite-sex couples currently have. It is a battle where equality, freedom, and happiness stand against long-held, but unfounded moral beliefs, as I see it.",

I merely wonder if it is not possible that some (though not all or even most) people who once \"experimented\" actually may have experienced a slight or dramatic change in their sexual orientation as they progressed from late teens to early twenties.
