   "I agree that our fiscal condition is probably as described in this link. But those pointed observations on foriegn policy is pure politics. Domestic spending is just as much at fault for our financial woes as is Foriegn spending, if not more so. When it says \"the segment of the American society that would like to see...........positive economic or social goals\" (read, WASTEFUL domestic spending) it fails to provide us with pointed observations on domestic policy.\n \n Doctors costs remain sky high largely because our government regulates their numbers. They have to make enough to pay malpractice insurance, so trial lawyers like John Edwards can become multi-millionaires. If there was some way to add up all the staggering costs of environmentalism and put them in front of the American people, it would probably go farther than any military cuts in solving some of our fiscal problems. \n \n Government is involved in so much private business and private life. If that could get the same careful look as those intent on cutting back on our foreign involvement in this dangerous world, maybe fiscal progress could be made.",

If that could get the same careful look as those intent on cutting back on our foreign involvement in this dangerous world, maybe fiscal progress could be made.\n\n \n The point is that our economy is in decline due to our high standard of living. That circumstance reduces domestic tax revenues and new wealth from export profits while we keep spending at ever-increasing levels using public debt. As the article points out, our demise is a progressive issue with social spending issues taking a back seat to military spending. As the problems become more severe, the federal government will continue pushing social costs down to the state level, complete with federal regulatory compliance, solely to maintain a position of military power. Given the geographical mass of the world with currently emerging powers and our position of being 4% of the population, there's simply no way we can continue to spend at our current levels. Our currency will continue to decline and credit facilities,which is all we're currently living on, will evaporate. \n \n You're pointing out isolated issues based on ideological emotion that almost makes you sound like a member of the military. We no longer have the economic capability to afford current and future social or military spending levels. Our annual military spending is just so vast that it overshadows all other fiscal expenditures because it happens to be about the same size as our annual deficits. Study other failed empires for examples of economic decline and you'll see the parallels. We're currently being supported by other nations because we're still a valuable consumer market. As China surpasses us as the major world market, our importance as a market will decline and the money taps will be closed. We've created so much world resentment with our aggressive policies that not a few nations will welcome our collapse.",

   "You make a lot of good points - there is no question you are more schooled on economics than I. But the statement \"....social spending issues taking a back seat to military spending\", that's where it gets to be a political issue which we may have to agree to disagree on. Is domestic spending (added with domestic waste) not also as high as our annual deficits? We DO have a high standard of living. Is it so high that we can afford to not utilize some natural recources in the interest of preserving natural beauty? Comparisons need to be made in military costs and domestic costs. Hard choices need to be made, and we're so spoiled that I'm afraid the proper domestic ones won't be, especially considering my favorite party's recent prescription drugs plan.\n \n I'm pleased that you suspect that I may be a member of the military - I'm not and never have been, but I do have the utmost respect for it. As far as ideological emotion, today's warm and fuzzy environmentalism doesn't stir my emotion near as much as the thought of a chemical or biological attack on a major US city, with tens of thousands of slow, agonizing deaths. I realize that's isolated ideological emotion, just the same as the emotional fear that few had on Sept.10, 2001, of planes flying into US buildings. \n \n I also think it's debatable just exactly how much world resentment we've actually created. That's great fodder for a profit seeking news media, but we're not as alone in Iraq as they would have us believe.",

   "Here's breakdown of how tax revenues are budgeted. I'm not promoting the website, they just have some handy references:\n \n http://www.warresisters.org/piechart.htm\n \n The largest portion of interest on the national debt, no matter who's numbers one uses, are for past military outlays and its a climbing curve. That's the debt that will eventually cross over revenues and borrowings to financially cripple us. The only real issue is when. \n \n I'm not advocating elimination of or a crippling downsizing of the military. Just getting the portion of expenditures that support our aggressive foreign policy and old pork programs out would assist in our return to reality. We certainly have the capability to vaporize any nation foolish enough to attack us with 50% of present expenditures. Raising the pay and benefits of a volunteer military to levels that make it one of the most attractive jobs to high school graduates who have no immediate intent of continuing their educations is a blatant example of social engineering, one that was a major contribution to the downfall of the Roman Empire. \n \n Our second big piece of chaos is social security. When implemented, it was a self-sustaining trust that would never require additional tax revenue. Unfortunately, like the Federal Highway trust fund, politicians found that borrowing from those trusts allowed them to divert trust money into general revenue, used to enhance their give-away programs and avoid raising taxes in the never-ending popularity contest of election and re-election. Now they're almost broke and within a few years will require general revenue funds to maintain even existing benefits. And those borrowings were backed with treasury issues, more debt. \n \n I don't include politics in economic analysis. While they are the major contributing factor as to how funds are spent, what is spent versus revenue and resulting debt service is my only concern. I'm not a doomsday messenger, but am very familiar with finance and economics and valid numbers just don't lie. Unless, of course, they're highly polished government numbers being used to sooth the public for election purposes. But anyone with a calculator or spreadsheet can extrapolate our budgets, debt service and revenues. Combine those with a declining economy and that's not a pretty picture regardless of anyone's political affiliation or dreams.",

   "I agree with most of what you are saying. But I believe military spending is easier to document and keep track of than domestic spending. If it costs - what is it - 5 billion per month for the war in Iraq, I'd say that's pretty much what it costs. Nothing hidden, no surprises. Domestic spending stairsteps right in to the economy with costs that no one can document. It's like when the EPA dictates new \"soot\" standards for diesel engines. They can estimate all the new research and development for new engine design, retooling, testing, poorer fuel milage, etc. But until its all done and been ON THE ROAD for years, no one knows what the actual cost will be. Even then, it's hard to document, and the mandate is all but impossible to reverse. In addition to agencies like the EPA who must impose costs on society simply to justify their existance, there is also the hard-to-document costs of our legal system. John Edwards got rich on a very small division of our healthcare system, (cesarean sections) countless other malpractice lawyers have their target specialties. \n \n In 1988, a tragic, freak bus accident happened in Ky. A drunk driver in a compact pickup going the wrong way on the interstate collided with a church bus. (former school bus) 999,999 times out of a million there are minor injuries on the bus and the pickup driver is dead. But this time, they hit a glancing blow, crumpling in such a way to cushion the pickup driver from much injury. The bus front spring cut into the gas tank and ripped open the front corner of the bus just right. 28? people on the bus burned to death. I'll bet there isn't an economist anywhere that can even estimate what that one accident still costs our society. In addition to an army of lawyers becoming rich off of it, there was so much sensationalism and mis-information of how dangerous school buses are. (they are in fact the safest surface transportation on earth) Many completely useless, yet costly \"safety features\" became mandated on school buses all across the country because of that one accident. It was a costly, feel good measure, nothing more. Going back 30 years to 1958, another Ky bus, a SCHOOL bus this time, plunged into a river, killing the same number, 28. Just as tragic, but it didn't become a news media and litigation circus. They didn't mandate FLOTATION DEVICES on hundreds of thousands of buses because of it.\n \n I agree that maybe some of the fat could be trimmed from our military operations around the world. But would it hurt to compare today's domestic way of life to the way it was 30 or 40 years ago, devoid of so many of today's government agencies?",

   "Those are specific incidents, all created by public apathy and politicians catering to special interests. I'm sure many private trust funds were filled to the brim.\n \n As the federal government continues to push social costs down to state and county levels to conserve cash flow from a shrinking tax base, public debt and declining economy, complete with federal legislation, those entities will face a spending wall. Education is primarily funded at local levels from property and business taxes, and federal legislative emphasis on equality, not quality, will hasten the further deterioration of our educational system. Property tax caps are already becoming popular in many states. With modest increases in property tax revenues, a decimated tax base when the real estate bubble bursts, medical care, infrastructure maintenance and most public services will be decimated. \n \n Based on keeping the public in a position of fear from retaliation to our crusader mentality and special interests dominated foreign policy, the military will continue to grow. Flag waving and fear are powerful motivators. \n \n Do the numbers. We're a declining industrial power with a shrinking tax base that exists at the pleasure of other countries propping up our dollar by buying our debt issues due to the importance of our consumer markets. Our disclosed annual deficit is approaching one-third of our operating budget with the lion's share going to military expenditures and debt service. Not a pretty picture with zero hope of positive change without a push by disaster.",

   "I don't think the military will continue to grow. I don't want it too, and I don't see as much public support for a LARGER military, as I do for anti-military activism. In addition to us having the pleasure of other countries propping up our dollar, other countries have the pleasure of basking under the protection of our military umbrella. \n \n I agree with your assessment of the fiscal situation, but have a different idea of what to do about it. I think the specific incidents I mentioned are just a microscopic example of domestic waste that so many Americans aren't aware of - that the lion's share of our money problems don't rest with the military. \n \n I'm done here, you can have the last word if you want. I remember you from the FTE forum - I appreciate your civility (at least in this thread haha)\n \n We'll spar again. emoticon_xgood",
