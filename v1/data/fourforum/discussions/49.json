   "Originally posted by voiceofreason \n I do intend to help my community and share the responsibility through non-violent means. I'm not going to go around stabbing and shooting people who I think are criminals. That's not the way to do it. The way to do it is to pass stricter gun-control laws.\n \n I'm not going to stand by idly and watch as thousands of people are killed each year with guns in the US. You might be content to bury your head in the sand and pretend everything is rosy, but I believe in getting involved and trying to make a difference. It's called being a concerned citizen. \n \n \n What is your non-violent way of stopping a felon with a knife? A felon who at 30 has spent 10 years in prison and was raped by other prisoners?\n \n I suspect you will do what most New Yorkers will do when they witness a crime: NOT GET INVOLVED!\n \n I will stop carrying a pistol when life is rosy. What else do you do to protect yourself besides being concerned?",

The incident you refer to in New York refers to nobody bothering to call the police when they witnessed a crime.\n \n You contradict yourself. First, you warn me of the dangers of using violent means to stop a crime. You told me the story of a well-intentioned person stabbing an undercover cop. Now you're saying that you yourself would carry a pistol. So you would be willing to use violent means to stop a crime. At least try to be consistent and don't change your story every 5 minutes so that you can win the argument.",

It was an honest mistake, and the cop should have yelled, \"Hey, I'm a cop!\" \n \n Anyway, voiceofreason, do you really think that calling 911, watching someone die, and then being a really good witness for the police is a better outcome than actually having the nerve to stand up and protect another member of society? I'm not espousing heroics here. Only fools want to be heros, because 9 of 10 who try to be heros die in the process and never make that kind of status, but I feel that we have a responsibility to our fellow man to help on another. Donate to charity, volunteer for the girls and boy's club, and come to someones aid when they're in harm's way. The way I was raised, I see nothing heroic about coming to the aid of one who is being attacked, even if it means taking the life of the attacker. To run away, even if to call 911, is the route of one who ignores their responsibility to society.",
