   "But aren't the exchanges primarily aimed at those who can't get insurance otherwise?\nThey are for anyone who doesn't have insurance.\n \n \nI would have thought that if insurance was so little used by young people, insurers would be keen to get their business, and premiums would be low. \n Well 18-34 make up 55% or so of the uninsured (30% 18-25). \n \n Insurance doesn't work by you paying what you'll use. Otherwise young would pay nothing and a 40yr old would pay a boat load and a 65 year old couldn't afford it. It is spread out so everyone can afford it and the insurance companies make the most under the regulations imposted. So my premiums are the same as everyone else on the age scale at my work. \n \n If you are uninsured the same basic idea will apply with these exchanges. Since paying anything is probably more than what they are currently paying it has an adverse effect on people. Someone suggested the subsidies as helping...well, of the 40-50 million \"uninsured\" only 10 million or less could receive a subsidy (I'm not sure if that 10 million includes illegal aliens who can't get them). The rest of them are either not required to get insurance and thus won't or would be forced to pay for it without any help. \n \n \nMaybe insurance is more necessary for young people than you think?\nNo, there is a reason young people who can afford health insurance don't get it.",

The hospital would generally eat a lot of that cost. \n \n \nSecondly, they will need it when they get old. If you let them pay only when they are old the cost would be so astronomical that they would not be able to afford it.\nYou don't get points for being insured at a young age. If you buy your own insurance young and when you are old the rates when you are old will never be dependent on who insured you when you were young. Besides, Medicare covers you when you are old.\n \n \nWhere did you get the idea about limited plans?\nAs a critic of health insurance companies you of all people should know about maximum benefits. I'm not sure if these were outlawed by the new law but before hand you could get plan that had a max payout. Most are in the millions so it isn't a big deal but I've heard of some small companies offering cheaper plans that don't cover much.\n \n \nIf you are a small business you can let evryone of you health plan already.\nYeah, and they might be better off just doing that now. \n \n Think, if a business has 50 employees and 30 of them are high enough to get a health insurance plan and the rest are low level support workers (like a janitor or something) who do not get benefits then it is possible the company would have to pay $2,000 per employee if the janitor can't afford health insurance. As a result the company might feel it is better to just let everyone get their health insurance with the exchange. \n \n \nWe do not have \"a few folks struggling to pay for health insurance\", we have forty million uninsured, people going bakrupt every day, and some possibly going untreated.\n40-50 million uninsured. 10+ million are still going to be uninsured since they are illegally here. So really talking 30-40..or 35 million to split the difference. Of that, less than 10 million (or at 10 million) make under four times the poverty level...the only people who can receive a subsidy. The rest have to BUY health insurance when they probably don't need it and want that money for other things! Probably the most damning part of your argument is that 78% of those people going bankrupt from medical bills HAD insurance! So you are going to force people to buy insurance that probably won't help them in any way. Thanks.\n \n \nIf companies drop their health plans and people will have to pay for their health insurance it will be exactly what the teabaggers want.\nI don't know what the teabaggers want but I sure would like to end employer based healthcare insurance. It is a strain on businesses and probably drives up the cost AND is really unfair to smaller businesses or self employed folks. health insurance companies and our government sold the myth that large companies has a big risk pool but as Daewoo pointed out a few months ago, the risk poll is the entire customer base of the insurance company. It is silly to think otherwise and if we all paid our own way like all other insurance we would be better off...even with subsidizing the poor. \n \n \nAccording to you the cost will be actually lower and business will expand tremendously.\nPaying $2,000 per employee does not really help a business. I don't know what Rush was saying as I don't listen to his show but small business would probably suffer the most from this bill just because they do not have the resources to handle such a mess. I'm a firm believer that large businesses do tend to stagnate growth since they are normally run in a way that makes them slow to adapt to changes. \n \n \nListen, you are trying to prove that under the new system we will pay more and get less. This is nonsense. We are not getting something for nothing under the current system.\nActually I'm saying we will pay the same or more and get less....or in otherwords we are going to be paying much more than any other country and get less quality care while currently we are paying much more than any other country and get the same or better care (even if the better is not needed).",

   "Right! That is how we get something for nothing in the current system.\nNo, someone ends up paying. There is no benefit for you to take the option either as you get the boot as soon as you can walk yourself out the front door. \n \n \nBut they will. That is why it is mandatory. The young people will contribute to the pool, so the rates will be affordable when they grow old.\nYou don't get it. They get Medicare when they are old. More importantly, 10 million more young on insurance won't lower in additional insurance for old people because, as I'm told, the way the exchanges are going to be designed. Even if we all were in one large pool all paying the same rate it would still be the same amount of money overall...just the young would be subsidizing the old...kinda odd when you talk about being affordable.\n \n \nAnd where will the extra money go? Currently we pay twice as much as the rest of OECD for the same quality and without covering everybody. Now we will pay twice as much as the rest of OECD for less quality healthcare.\nIt will go the same places it has always gone although some meetings I've been to with hospitals have told me they will take a hit since the government would help pay for care they provided for people who couldn't afford it. Like I said, it will go up a little or stay the same (as in same rate of increase). The thing that gives us less quality is that more people with insurance means more doctors visits..even when not really needed. For example, if you had a cough but had to fork over $150 for the doctor to tell you that you had a cough then you might just play the odds that you have a cold and stay home. If you already paid $150 in insurance and you had a cough then there is no reason why you wouldn't see the doctor. \n \n As an aside, lets remove the myth that government paying for health care always results in poor health care (let me clarify I'm not totally convinced myself with what I'm about to say). I realize I stated this bill would result in less quality but this isn't always the case. There is some evidence to suggest Medicare caused a huge increase in hospital equipment and technology. This is mostly due to the fact that Medicare would give you a blank check to do anything. In most instances where government gets the private sector to do something using a blank check you end up with more than you needed at a really high cost....and probably delivered in a dysfunctional manner. Medicare is probably a huge reason our costs are so high today but probably the reason we have a lot of equipment as well.\n \n \nI wonder what you are proposing. Should we be like the rest of the developed countries or should we retain status quo?\nI think we should stop using logical fallacies in arguments. After you remove the false dichotomy we realize that those aren't the only two options.\n \n So far you haven't really shown why this bill is any good. You kind of lost on the bankruptcy argument so perhaps time to try a new one.",
