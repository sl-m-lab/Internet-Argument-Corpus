This supernova was surrounded by distant rings of gas which could be observed 'lighting up' as the light from the supernova hit it.

Simply put, I'll let this link answer your distance of stars claim. http://www.ibri.org/Tracts/lttmetct.htm\n \n But for a more practical answer, imagine this. In the beginning, space was a void which spanned all of eternity. Only one object/energy source encompassed all of it from one end of its massive emptiness to the other, and that person was my God Yahweh. And in one second or minutes time, he spoke all of the stars that have ever existed, at different intensities and strengths, which causes them to burn out at different times. But he placed them at the very inner and outer limits of time and space at that time. Liken it to a farmer with a hand full of seeds. He pulls back his arm and throws those seeds to the end of the plot of land he is sowing at that time. To the ants on the ground, if they measured the time it would take to reach the farthest seed, it would represent a great distance, but to the farmer it was just one arms throw in time to disperse hundreds of seeds at one time. \n \n Now here we are as finite creatures who can only see time from our linear perspective. Time is plastic. Our linear measure is man made for our convenience only. That you place what we call the measure of so called light years is arbitrary at best. But I am getting too deep for you and this discussion. The point is that our God has the ability to place the stars in every corner of not only what we again, arbitrarily call our universe, but throughout all of time and space. \n \n But to we puny finite humans who have invented telescopes, it appears that these stars we are seeing today are ancient based on the perceived yet arbitrarily arrived at distance you believe they are from us. But since you are unable to even grasp the hugeness of our God, you also fail to appreciate that light years are a measure of distance rather than time. So by that definition alone, it is foolish to equate it with Earth time rather than Gods ability to reach any distant place in time and space and place stars there. emoticon_xgood",

Here is my scientific link which clearly points out that a light year is a measure of distance, not time. emoticon_xgood\n Light Year\n A unit of interstellar distance, defined as the distance light travels in a period of one year. The speed of light is constant, at about 300,000 km per second: a light year is very nearly 10 million million km. From an Earthbound perspective, this is a vast distance - our entire Solar System, out to the orbit of Pluto, is only one eight-hundredth of a light year across.\n \n On an interstellar scale, though, a single light year is rather small. It covers less than a quarter of the distance to our nearest neighbour, Proxima Centauri. Our entire Galaxy is 100,000 light years across or more.\n \n Perhaps because of this, the term 'light year' is sometimes misused as a unit of time (in expressions like 'light years ago' or 'light years into the future'). This is never correct - a 'light year' is only ever used to measure distance.eSky: Light Year\n \n So what is true idiocy is your incorrect criticism of me while ignoring Iangb's misuse of the term by using it as a measure of time rather than distance. emoticon_xdonno",

   "I still can't get over archie's response to the distance of stars objection to a young universe. It really puts into perspective the utter hopelessness and futilty in attempt to discuss anything with closed-minded fundamentalists. And his response is so authoritative, as though he could just as easily link us to an essay God himself wrote as evidence to back up what he's saying. \n \n This is really getting old. We come to a dilema that is much bigger than science vs the bible. How far off rational thinking is too far? What kind of mental bulimia must one undergo to reach this stage? Sometimes the metaphor is made to compare religion to a mind-altering drug, but its mostly tongue-in-cheek sarcasm. But I think there's a serious problem here. This is starting to resemble dementia. \n \n And I don't blame God, or the bible, or moses and the other israelite scribes who borrowed stories from other cultures to fill in their history and keep their people in check with myths and boogeyman tales. I blame the believers today, who have all the tools and information in front of them, and still make the decision to believe lies and folklore. And to decay their own brains in the process. \n \n Archie, get help dude. I'm not even bashing you or anything. This isn't me being snide or sarcastic. If you don't take a look at what you're saying and really try to figure out what is going on to make you come up with these kinds of responses, then I don't know what else to tell you.\n\n \n Here it is again. Mock it all you like, but I realize it is way beyond you secular humanists capacity to grasp. So marvel all you like in unbelief. But one day you will realize it was you with no understanding. emoticon_xgood\n \n \nBut for a more practical answer, imagine this. In the beginning, space was a void which spanned all of eternity. Only one object/energy source encompassed all of it from one end of its massive emptiness to the other, and that person was my God Yahweh. And in one second or minutes time, he spoke all of the stars that have ever existed, at different intensities and strengths, which causes them to burn out at different times. But he placed them at the very inner and outer limits of time and space at that time. Liken it to a farmer with a hand full of seeds. He pulls back his arm and throws those seeds to the end of the plot of land he is sowing at that time. To the ants on the ground, if they measured the time it would take to reach the farthest seed, it would represent a great distance, but to the farmer it was just one arms throw in time to disperse hundreds of seeds at one time. \n \n Now here we are as finite creatures who can only see time from our linear perspective. Time is plastic. Our linear measure is man made for our convenience only. That you place what we call the measure of so called light years is arbitrary at best. But I am getting too deep for you and this discussion. The point is that our God has the ability to place the stars in every corner of not only what we again, arbitrarily call our universe, but throughout all of time and space. \n \n But to we puny finite humans who have invented telescopes, it appears that these stars we are seeing today are ancient based on the perceived yet arbitrarily arrived at distance you believe they are from us. But since you are unable to even grasp the hugeness of our God, you also fail to appreciate that light years are a measure of distance rather than time. So by that definition alone, it is foolish to equate it with Earth time rather than Gods ability to reach any distant place in time and space and place stars there. emoticon_xgood\n",

   "May I chime in here a moment? I'm a religious person, and a theist. On the other hand, I'm not a creationist and I'm deeply opposed to Biblical literalism in general.\n \n Two things.\n \n First, why has Archie been allowed to hijack this thread? Accipiter's original request has been drowned out among the hoopla. We shouldn't fall for this, any more than a congressman or senator should fall for the disruptive tactics being employed at town hall meetings. Put him on ignore if you have to, but whatever you do, don't take the bait.\n \n Second, as to that original point, my own experience has been rather ironic on this score, I suppose: the single most effective thing to use in arguing against creationism is the Bible itself. After all, creationists typically claim a Biblical basis for the views. So rather than confronting them with something external to that basis -- which is all too easy for them to dismiss -- confront them with that basis itself.\n \n The fact is, the book of Genesis has two versions of the creation story, not one -- and they're not consistent with one another. In the first, humans are created after animals, and no temporal order is provided for the creation of the human sexes. In the second, Adam is created first, then all the animals (as God works through a trial-and-error process of making the first man a partner, without success), and then finally Eve is created. So were humans created last or (at least in part) first? It simply cannot be both.\n \n And then we have the historical information about the text. The second of the two stories was actually the first to be recorded, during the reign of Solomon in the 10th century BCE. It has a stunningly anthropomorphic conception of God in many ways -- God breathes, he walks, he has to call out to Adam and Eve to find them. And he creates in very \"hands-on\" fashion, pulling Adam from the earth and Eve from Adam\n \n The first story was recorded much later, following the period of the Babylonian Exile. Jewish identity was maintained in Babylon through such practices as circumcision, inter-marriage rules, and the rigorous observance of the Sabbath -- and this last practice is provided theological justification in the retelling of the creation story. God himself is depicted not as a manual craftsman, but as speaking things into being. (And if any creationist ever provides a mechanism for how that could work, they'd at least be on the way to creation \"science.\" I'm not holding my breath.)\n \n Historically speaking, one thing that is also abundantly clear is that the the books of the Pentateuch, including Genesis, and including the two creation accounts, were not written by Moses, despite tradition. And of course, if one wants to make that authorial attribution, then one has the additional problem of explaining why a single author would compose two mutually inconsistent accounts of the same event.\n \n I have seen people get very uncomfortable with this. Most, I think, aren't even really aware of the problems, and when confronted with it they get defensive. What I try to do is point out to them that even though these stories cannot both be literally true, they can still reveal truths about God in relation to the world, rooted in personal experiences of ancient believers and expressed in terms pertinent to those experiences. I try to point them to a middle path, where giving up literalism doesn't mean giving up faith.\n \n Obviously, those who are atheists or agnostics won't necessarily want to encourage people to hold on to their religious beliefs! But I would recommend that, even if you don't wish to promote Christianity in particular or religion more generally, observing that abandoning literalism isn't equivalent to abandoning religion altogether can still be an effective tactic at overcoming their creationist views. Even if it doesn't work right away, it may bear fruit later.\n \n It might also be good to remember that much of the scholarship on which non-literalist interpretation is based pre-dates Darwin and occurred within the Church, not without. Throughout the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Biblical scholars in European universities (especially in Germany) delved into the textual and historical issues pertaining to the holy scriptures, and many theologians explored their consequences. It is that exploration that we can thank for liberal theology on the one hand, but also for literalism on the other. Darwin was, in a sense, just the icing on the cake.\n \n Just my two cents.",

   "But if there is no original sin and man doesn't have a sinful nature, then sin is only caused by transgressing against God's laws, right?\n\n \n Sin is a part of human nature. If \"Original Sin\" is taken as a metaphor for that, I don't see a problem. The fact is, every human being sometimes behaves as she shouldn't, in greater or lesser degree. This could be seen as a transgression of God's laws, but it could also be seen as a failure to emulate God's love. It could also be seen in any number of other ways, many of which would be compatible with one another.\n \n But human nature is not exclusively or even predominantly sinful. If \"Original Sin\" is taken to mean that it is, I do consider that a problem. For the fact also is, every human being sometimes does good, whether great or small. This could be seen as following God's laws, emulating God's love, or again, in any number of other ways, often compatible.\n \n \nAnd not everybody necessarily needs to be forgiven if they haven't sinned, right?\n\n \n Well, as I said above, I think everybody sins from time to time. It's certainly the case that some sin more than others. And some sins have more harmful and far-reaching consequences than others. But everybody sins. At some point, we all need at least a little forgiveness.\n \n I'm sorry if these answers weren't helpful! I confess that I wasn't entirely clear that I understood what the questions were driving at.\n \n And I hope that our discussion won't distract further from the OP's point! By way of reconnecting to it, let me just repeat that I think the best tool to use against creationism is the Bible. When people pay attention to what the Bible actually says and to the history of its composition -- and those who call ourselves Christians ought to be committed to such attention as a matter of religious principle! -- the idea of a literalized creation narrative doesn't make sense.",

   "Fair enough matthew. Maybe I'll get a chance later to hear more about the idea of christianity without a literal creation, but this is not the right thread for it. \n \n Personally, the evidence that put the biggest dent in my belief in creation (and, by extension, christianity) is the very obvious lack of supernatural activity in modern times (the last, say, 200 years or so). There is a trend in the bible concerning miraculous activity. The further back you go in history, the grander the miracle in terms of scale, power and effect on history. By the time we get the new testament, miracles seem to be diminished to local and personal performances. Today, the only miracles we hear about are those that no third party can witness. And the nature of the reports of these miracles make them seem dubious as they can almost be always written off as figments of one's imagination or explained naturally. \n \n So what happened? Did God's supply of power run dry? Is he saving up his miraculous reserves for some big showing? If God cannot create the miraculous today, then its clear that he never did it thousands of years ago, particularly at a time when superstition was at an all time high and scientific knowledge was at an all time low.\n \n And none of this requires excavations, telescopes or laboratories.

It presents absolutely no empirical evidence that such physical laws were changed. It presents absolutely no hard proof that such events actually occurred. Your crack pot logic dictates that if the Bible said it here, therefore whatever asinine arguments you make in defense of your invalid beliefs of your interpretation of your God (despite making it a liar which you have deliberately ignored time and time again despite accusing others of doing the same behavior) are valid on the same argument.

Is God responsible for how we interpret the evidence when we attempt to do it apart from placing Him first and foremost into the equation? Is He the liar? Or are you who think like that deceiving yourselves by ignoring His place in the creation of time and space? \n \n It is just completely beyond you to think from an honest and objective perspective, isn't it obvious child! \n But for a more practical answer, imagine this. In the beginning, space was a void which spanned all of eternity. Only one object/energy source encompassed all of it from one end of its massive emptiness to the other, and that person was my God Yahweh. And in one second or minutes time, he spoke all of the stars that have ever existed, at different intensities and strengths, which causes them to burn out at different times. But he placed them at the very inner and outer limits of time and space at that time. Liken it to a farmer with a hand full of seeds. He pulls back his arm and throws those seeds to the end of the plot of land he is sowing at that time. To the ants on the ground, if they measured the time it would take to reach the farthest seed, it would represent a great distance, but to the farmer it was just one arms throw in time to disperse hundreds of seeds at one time. \n \n Now here we are as finite creatures who can only see time from our linear perspective. Time is plastic. Our linear measure is man made for our convenience only. That you place what we call the measure of so called light years is arbitrary at best. But I am getting too deep for you and this discussion. The point is that our God has the ability to place the stars in every corner of not only what we again, arbitrarily call our universe, but throughout all of time and space. \n \n But to we puny finite humans who have invented telescopes, it appears that these stars we are seeing today are ancient based on the perceived yet arbitrarily arrived at distance you believe they are from us. But since you are unable to even grasp the hugeness of our God, you also fail to appreciate that light years are a measure of distance rather than time. So by that definition alone, it is foolish to equate it with Earth time rather than Gods ability to reach any distant place in time and space and place stars there. emoticon_xgood\n",

   "It seems there is a 15year old Indian kid who understands parallax calculations, unlike Archie. We know how far away stars are. There is no \"arbtrary\" about it, it is a straightforward question of mathematics and geometry. No trickster gods necessary.\n \n \" In order to calculate how far away a star is, astronomers use a method called parallax. During Earth's orbit, near stars seem to shift their position against the farther stars. This is called parallax shift. By observing the distance of the shift and knowing the diameter of the Earth's orbit, astronomers are able to calculate the parallax angle across the sky.\n If you follow the line on the diagram from the Earth in January to the appearance of the star in January, then the line from the Earth in July to the appearance of the star in July, you will see that they intersect in the middle. This is the true location of the star. The distance of the star can then be measured using trigonometry.\n \n The smaller the parallax shift, the farther away from earth the star is. This method is only accurate for stars within a few hundred light-years of Earth, since when the stars are very far away, the parallax shift is too small to measure.\n \n The method of measuring distance to stars beyond 100 light-years is to use Cepheid variable stars. These stars change in brightness over time, with a regular period. This period is directly related to the luminosity of the star--brighter stars have a longer period of light variation. Comparing the apparent brightness of the star to the true brightness allows the astronomer to calculate the distance to the star. This method was discovered by American astronomer Henrietta Leavitt in 1912 and used in the early part of the century to find distances to many globular clusters. .... \"\n \n How do astronomers measure the distance to stars? Is it accurate?\n \n To persist in the stupidity of denying this, a method not found wanting in 100 years, and of fact that the unit of distance measurement of light YEARS can not be used to measure time, is frankly mad.\n \n One light-year is equal to 9,500,000,000,000 kilometers. That is the distance traveled by a photon in one year. If we triangulate the distance between two stars which are equally distant from us as being 9,500,000,000,000 kilometres, then we can confidently say that light from one of those stars will take one year to travel to the other one. It follows from this that stars one hundred times further apart will be 100 light years from each other, and so on. The distance can be a measure of the time light takes to get between two points.\n If two points are a million light-years apart, then light will take a million years to get from one to the other.",

   "Archangel, here's why obvious child keeps accusing you of arguing that your god is an epic liar. Your theory about God \"throwing\" stars into the universe, yet allowing the light from all these stars to be visible on earth within a single day, requires God to have increased the speed of light by trillions of times. You further argue that God did that on that creation day, then reverted the speed of light back to its regular constant, to make it appear as though these stars are millions of light years away. By this, God would, in future generations, fool scientists into thinking that they are looking at distant stars (which they are), whose multimillion (and sometimes billion) year history only occured in the last 10000 years or so, but sped up dramatically. So what we are looking at is the superslow unfolding of the history of stars that were temporarily sped up, then brought back to normal speed. \n \n Not only is this theory both scientifically impossible and biblically inconsistent, it also means that God intentionally took time to create an elaborate fabrication of cosmology on a scale that can be no less described as epic. \n And you actually believe this is true, because you feel you it helps you to cling to your religion better than believing that stars that are millions of light years away from us must be at least millions of years old if we are able to see them. \n \n Review your \"star throwing\" thesis again. If you actually comprehend what you wrote, and the logical repercussions of such an event even taking place (even though you support your thesis with absolutely nothing) you will probably understand why obvious child continues to accuse you of calling your own god an epic liar. \n \n \n \n I'll save you the trouble of writing your rebuttal to my post and write it for you.

   "Archangel, here's why obvious child keeps accusing you of arguing that your god is an epic liar. Your theory about God \"throwing\" stars into the universe, yet allowing the light from all these stars to be visible on earth within a single day, requires God to have increased the speed of light by trillions of times. You further argue that God did that on that creation day, then reverted the speed of light back to its regular constant, to make it appear as though these stars are millions of light years away. By this, God would, in future generations, fool scientists into thinking that they are looking at distant stars (which they are), whose multimillion (and sometimes billion) year history only occured in the last 10000 years or so, but sped up dramatically. So what we are looking at is the superslow unfolding of the history of stars that were temporarily sped up, then brought back to normal speed. \n \n Not only is this theory both scientifically impossible and biblically inconsistent, it also means that God intentionally took time to create an elaborate fabrication of cosmology on a scale that can be no less described as epic. \n And you actually believe this is true, because you feel you it helps you to cling to your religion better than believing that stars that are millions of light years away from us must be at least millions of years old if we are able to see them. \n \n Review your \"star throwing\" thesis again. If you actually comprehend what you wrote, and the logical repercussions of such an event even taking place (even though you support your thesis with absolutely nothing) you will probably understand why obvious child continues to accuse you of calling your own god an epic liar. \n\n \n Since you can't follow what I actually say paulie let me clarify it for you. I said that God spoke all of creation into existence, the statement of Him throwing the stars like a farmer throws grain was an analogy in order to create a mental image to show that millions or billions of years needn't have passed for it to have occurred. Yet from our linear point of view, it would obviously appear to have happened in the distant past.\n \n I have also showed how attempting to actually reason with the likes of you and child is a waste of time since I have shown that Jesus DID in fact trump many of the physical laws we are subservient to with the miracles he manifested. These miracles which were witnessed by untold numbers of people at the time, yet you still insist that believing that God isn't limited by His own laws is somehow wrong. Miracles Of Jesus 2 These are solid evidence that Jesus/God isn't submissive to the physical laws which rule the natural world He created us within. \n \n So you can call my belief a theory all you like. And you can insist that your finite intellectualism can comprehend what actually occurred before any humans even existed, and apart from Gods word, which gives us the only insight into what actually took place before life existed on Earth. But you will come no closer to actually grasping it apart from the supernatural.\n \n \nI'll save you the trouble of writing your rebuttal to my post and write it for you. You're going to emphatically declare, again, that my errant analysis of what you wrote is a result of my inability to grasp spiritual truths, (but you're not going to say exactly how its wrong, or attempt to correct it) and that it makes no sense trying to reason these things with me, since I'm already committed to my atheistic philosphies.

I realize though that you would like nothing more than to spew your atheistic drivel without challenge from me, but that just isn't going to happen here. \n \n The fact is that I can't speak to Gods timing based on what He has said in His word, because He doesn't give times or dates. All I can do is attempt to discern how and when He accomplished what Genesis speaks to apart from the man made philosophy of evolution which at its core erases God from the equation of how man came to be here. \n \n Genesis doesn't speak to timing as I said, but neither does it speak against my interpretation in any way.

Don't forget that possibility!\n \n Granted, there is no conceivable way to test either possibility anyway....\n \n At least in the ancient Aristotelian/Ptolemaic cosmologies employed by most early and medieval Christian thinkers, the distances are not so vast as to raise the issue of God's honesty in the first place.\n \n \nNot only is this theory both scientifically impossible and biblically inconsistent, it also means that God intentionally took time to create an elaborate fabrication of cosmology on a scale that can be no less described as epic.\n\n \n That, for me, is why creationism is such a preposterous idea. Regardless of whether the untestable changing-speed-of-light idea or the equally untestable photons-created-in-mid-transit is how God did it, he's a deceiver either way. He gave us the power of reason, which serves us perfectly well for explaining any number of natural phenomena. But use it on some phenomena, and it gives us systematically false results -- even though God himself set things up that way, and (as Descartes noted) gave us no way to discern that falsehood.\n \n I've said it before, and I'll say it again: One might as well worship a trickster deity like Loki or Coyote.",

The reasoning extends from the idea that when God made Adam, he was already a grown and mature man even though he was created that same day. So if God could make a brand new 1-day old man complete with physical signs of age, he could also create a brand new planet and universe, complete with the appearance of being billions of years old. \n \n The good thing about this is that, in the creationist's mind, it explains the evidence of a very old earth while maintain that earth is actually young. But the bad thing is that it makes God out to be an epic liar. Why would God think it would be necessary to make the earth look old? Why would God think that he would have to lie to his creation? Couldn't God make a functional brand new planet look brand new? Were fossils miles below the surface of the earth really necessary details that God felt he had to create so that 6000-10000 years into the future his lies would be exposed? Couldn't God have prevented humans from learning the speed of light or principles of trigonometry? For all the years that man was ignorant of the evidence we now know, the biblical creation was completely unquestioned. But surely God would have known that the keeping lid on his deceptive scheme was running out of time. The evidence should never have been there, but it is. And if God made the world to look older than it really was, then surely he would have known that eventually this would have happened. \n \n Archangel, do you really believe, personally, that God actually created the earth 6000-10000 years ago, but also created multiple forms of evidence that would make the earth look like it is billions of years old?",

   "This is not true. We have brand new petroleum and coal deposits forming under the earth even today. We have very well preserved remains of animals and humans in peat bogs and other environments that dramatically slow down decay. It takes a very long time for an anaerobic swamp to become petrified into solid rock, but to say that no fossils are being formed is a plain case of denying reality.\n\n \n Really? What alleged massive fields of animal remains/fossils are currently being turned into future oil deposits, and where did they come from? How recent in geological terms were they deposited? Why must I always be subjected to unproven claims from your side as you sanctimoniously make these statements as if they are facts.\n \n It's your side which claims it takes millions upon millions of years for Oil and Coal Deposits to form, yet here you are pointing to them forming now as you expect me to take your unsubstantiated word for it.\n \n \n This argument is so weak I'm surprised you even bother to mention it, as it has been debunked to death. Animals and plant remains that are found deep in the earth got that deep not because the animals burrowed into the ground, but because sand and sediment settled above them\n slowly, layer by layer, over many many years. Of course a vertical structure would take many many years to be completely buried by layers that are being formed horizontally. \n\n \n Really? And you have the nerve to claim to be the intelligent one between us? See the bolded? This is evidence of your denial of true reality as you make ridiculous assumptions which have absolutely no basis in fact at all. You are asserting than an animal has died, and slowly survives decomposition as a corpse, unmolested by scavengers long enough to be naturally covered by a naturally occurring layer of sand and earth which eventually become a distinct layer of strata.\n \n Then tell me paulie how this rabbit which was protected from scavengers didn't last past 8 days in reality in order to become a fossil? YouTube - Rabbit decomposition (time-lapse video)\n \n It is also undeniable which this link proves, The 1993 Midwest Floods and Rapid Canyon Formation that the very circumstances we are discussing have and do occur in very short periods of time via the flood process. I have shown from both ends with contemporary and undeniable evidence why my flood and decomposition perspective works in the real world as all you have offered is unsubstantiated insistence that you are right. And based on my evidence, your claims don't even pass the smell test.\n \n \nThis is under the assumption that the flood even occured, for which there is no evidence that it did, nor that noah built a boat big enough, nor the he could possibly have all the animals survive in confinement for 3 years, nor that the planet has enough water for a worldwide flood. Do you REALLY want to tally the inconsistencies of genesis and compare that to the inconsistencies in the scientific theories you argue about?\n \n \n Not at all. When will you get it through your head that the very same evidence you observe which you believe supports your beliefs in an old earth, I observe as evidence that the Great Flood occurred, and a young earth is valid? We both have the same evidence paulie, I just interpret it differently than you do. So don't you dare attempt to claim some upper hand of scientific proof which I lack. All you have is your interpretation which erases God from the equation.\n \n \nHere is where you really excel at avoiding the issue. We have evidence that the universe is very old, such as visible stars millions of light years away, varve formations that can be counted for over 2 million years, subterranian strata formations with fossils of extinct creatures, multiple radiometric dating methods that all independently date the earth to over 4 billion years. On the other hand, you have a book written by an old superstitious guy who borrowed cultural folklores and myths from other communities and wrote them down, adding his own religious bias. And of course you have faith, which, by definition, is the belief in something for which you have no supporting evidence for. \n \n All I can say is, what you claim to believe speaks volumes about the nature of your god.\n\n \n Wrong again paulie, you have observations which you interpret to suggest those outcomes. Not one scientist who is expert in those fields would state categorically without question that the results which come to these conclusion are absolute and unchangeable. Or wont be redefined next month or next year based on new information. The very age of the Universe we inhabit has gone from 2 billion years old to the current estimate that it's 14.5 billion years old today, and just over the last 50 years. And it will inevitably change again as it is realized that more time is required for the theorized evolutionary process to result in we human beings as we exist today.\n \n And how interesting that it allegedly took hundreds of millions of years for us to evolve up to the level of Neanderthal according to your pseudo science, yet only between 40,000 and 100,000 years to evolve from the Neanderthal whom it has been shown that we share DNA with, to where we stand today as the apex life form on Earth which we are today.

   "Seven Reasons Why Evolution is a Fraud\n \n 1. It's not science. You cannot observe, test and repeat the ever-changing ideas that are little more than wild speculation.\n \n 2. It devalues real science. Chemistry, physics and biology don't have the same problems of legitimacy because they are real sciences, not philosophical wannabes trying to appear legit.\n \n 3. Complex engineering. Do you ever drive past a skyscraper and think to yourself 'Gee, I guess billions of years of random chance could have just as easily assembled all of that glass, steel and concrete as well as a team of engineers, architects, construction workers working from blueprints? Of course not! But that's what evolutionists would have you believe in when it comes to living organisms.\n \n 4. Genetics. The programming code of life, according to evolutionists, is just a series of biochemical accidents and mutations. If you believe this, I have a bridge in New York that's for sale. The infinitely complex engineering of this code means that it did not come about via 'natural selection,' aka random chance.\n \n 5. Mathematically Impossible. Basic probability tells you that the odds of a blob of primordial ooze morphing into a man, regardless of how much time has passed, are so remote that mathematicians regard it as impossible. Emile Borel and Fred Hoyle are just two mathematicians who reject evolution on statistical grounds.\n \n 6. Evolution is a religion. Yes, evolution is the faith of atheism because it replaces God with man. When you've conned yourself into believing that some kind of ancient slime morphed into progressively complex and directional life forms, you are in the realm of faith, not science.\n \n 7. Racism. This is the ugly secret that evolutionists don't want to discuss; that Darwin, Huxley and many of the early advocates of evolution stated publicly that Asians, Africans, Australian Aborigines and other non-white, non-European groups were evolutionary throwbacks. Darwin's cousin, Francis Galton, was a pioneer in the early field of eugenics which was the study of skills by ethnic groups. While Galton's work was relatively harmless, Hitler's work -- to synthesize natural selection by exterminating a race of people -- was not.\n \n More info at Evofraud_indexSeven Reasons Why Evolution is a Fraud - Topix",

   "excuse me..\n \n but if Atheists dont base their views on science.. then what?\n \n it cant be religion.\n \n -Mosheh Thezion\nLogical contradictions within the bible? Reasoning? Absence of empirical evidence? Various atrocities committed in the name of religion?\n \n Science sometimes causes people to make theological decisions, but you don't need it - nor do you need to be religious - in order to think about theology.\n \n Attacking one specific branch of a religion as the sole basis for dispensing with the entirety of religion does not make sense, I agree. That's why few atheists do it. The attacking only goes on a lot here because this is the 'evolution vs creationism' forum.\n \n \nSeven Reasons Why Evolution is a Fraud\n\n 1: This claims that evolution is not a science, because it is not observable. However, what creationists term 'micro'-evolution has been observed - and used by humanity - for millennia. Breeting fatter pigs, faster horses or more hairy dogs, for example. More recently, engineering vaccines for the latest evolution of the flu virus.\n \n Furthermore, I doubt many creationists have difficulties with the concept of 'forensic science' - which, just like some parts of evolution, looks at the evidence left behind in order to figure out what happened. Forensic science sometimes leads people to the wrong conclusion, but for evolution our 'crime scene' is huge, and all of the evidence so far points in evolutions direction.\n \n 2: This is more a consequence of the first claim than a seperate argument. It runs 'If evolution is not a science, calling it as such devalues the real sciences'. See my answer to statement 1. I'd add that forensic science, just like evolution, is supported by work done in the fields of physics, chemistry and biology.\n \n 3. A rehash of the 'tornado in a junkyard' argument. It's an accurate analogy - as soon as you can find me a skyscraper that is subject to the same rules as evolving organisms (reproduction, mutation/variation, natural selection). Until then, it's all so much wasted words.\n \n 4. Another rehash of the 'tornado in a junkyard' argument, only this time comparing a bridge with genetic code, rather than a skyscraper with an organism. Nope, sorry, bridges don't reproduce either.\n \n 5. It's almost a rehash of the 'tornado' argument from above - it looks at the probability that a single object ('ancient slime') will 'morph' into, say, Fred Phelps. Perhaps a bad choice. As soon as you can find me a person who was once a blob of ancient slime, this analogy will, like the others, become a valid one.\n If you mean 'the probability that the slime evolved into us', then you run up against the mount improbable argument. It's unlikely that it happened in a single step, or even in a series of steps, if you ignore the fact that there are 'safety lines' in place - that is, if you ignore the fact that natural selection will kill off all those that start to go the wrong way.\n It's also fallacious thinking because of anthropism - it didn't matter what the slime evolved into, because whatever it did evolve into would still be sitting here arguing the point. As an example - consider your history, and the incredibly unlikely chance that you would be sitting right where you are today, with the clothes you chose this morning and the DNA which mixed from your parents just so. As Penfold says in your signature - if the universe was not as it is, it would be different. That doesn't mean that God has intervened specifically to make 'this' universe the one that has happened over, say, one where you were born a girl. Throw a million sided dice. The chances of it getting any specific side are tiny - but one side is guaranteed to be chosen.\n \n 6. Like #2 above it, this takes the conclusions of a previous argument (#5) and runs with them, stating that if evolution is mathematically impossible then it is a faith, which make evolution a religion. Apart from the fact that my response to #5 deals with this... on what basis are you claiming, Archangel, that because something is a religion then it is a fraud?\n \n 7. Evolution has been used as an excuse for atrocities such as racism, etc. Well, so has religion - no condoms to Africa, the Spanish Inquisition, rampant sexism, etc. So what? That doesn't affect the validity of the idea.",

And then you attempt to connect this theory to genesis 1\n , of course reinterpreting \"day\" to mean a long undefined period of time rather than a period of evening/morning cycle as the bible very clearly states. \n \n Nonetheless, the real problem I see with this theory is the lack of supporting evidence. You say that we have no reason to believe that man evolved from primates, because we have never found the missing link between species (even though we have many specimens that form a very gradual evolutionary chain). How do we then conclude that man must have evolved directly from fish species that walk out onto land? We have no signs of any such evolutionary chain at all. Your case is built upon the fact that human embryos resemble fish embryos, then rodent embryos, then humans, during fetal development. This is also the case with nearly all mammals, including apes, and very likely including extinct homonids. So the link between fish and man seems even more distant than that of man and ape. And it supports the idea, somewhat, that ALL lifeforms are derived from fish forms. However, it doesn't support your model. \n \n Imo, what you need to do is create a model that actually matches the real evidence we have, not create a model that matches your already formed beliefs, then only pick out pieces of evidence that fit with that model.",

   " \n 1: This claims that evolution is not a science, because it is not observable. However, what creationists term 'micro'-evolution has been observed - and used by humanity - for millennia. Breeting fatter pigs, faster horses or more hairy dogs, for example. More recently, engineering vaccines for the latest evolution of the flu virus.\n \n Furthermore, I doubt many creationists have difficulties with the concept of 'forensic science' - which, just like some parts of evolution, looks at the evidence left behind in order to figure out what happened. Forensic science sometimes leads people to the wrong conclusion, but for evolution our 'crime scene' is huge, and all of the evidence so far points in evolutions direction.\n \n 2: This is more a consequence of the first claim than a seperate argument. It runs 'If evolution is not a science, calling it as such devalues the real sciences'. See my answer to statement 1. I'd add that forensic science, just like evolution, is supported by work done in the fields of physics, chemistry and biology.\n \n 3. A rehash of the 'tornado in a junkyard' argument. It's an accurate analogy - as soon as you can find me a skyscraper that is subject to the same rules as evolving organisms (reproduction, mutation/variation, natural selection). Until then, it's all so much wasted words.\n \n 4. Another rehash of the 'tornado in a junkyard' argument, only this time comparing a bridge with genetic code, rather than a skyscraper with an organism. Nope, sorry, bridges don't reproduce either.\n \n 5. It's almost a rehash of the 'tornado' argument from above - it looks at the probability that a single object ('ancient slime') will 'morph' into, say, Fred Phelps. Perhaps a bad choice. As soon as you can find me a person who was once a blob of ancient slime, this analogy will, like the others, become a valid one.\n If you mean 'the probability that the slime evolved into us', then you run up against the mount improbable argument. It's unlikely that it happened in a single step, or even in a series of steps, if you ignore the fact that there are 'safety lines' in place - that is, if you ignore the fact that natural selection will kill off all those that start to go the wrong way.\n It's also fallacious thinking because of anthropism - it didn't matter what the slime evolved into, because whatever it did evolve into would still be sitting here arguing the point. As an example - consider your history, and the incredibly unlikely chance that you would be sitting right where you are today, with the clothes you chose this morning and the DNA which mixed from your parents just so. As Penfold says in your signature - if the universe was not as it is, it would be different. That doesn't mean that God has intervened specifically to make 'this' universe the one that has happened over, say, one where you were born a girl. Throw a million sided dice. The chances of it getting any specific side are tiny - but one side is guaranteed to be chosen.\n \n 6. Like #2 above it, this takes the conclusions of a previous argument (#5) and runs with them, stating that if evolution is mathematically impossible then it is a faith, which make evolution a religion. Apart from the fact that my response to #5 deals with this... on what basis are you claiming, Archangel, that because something is a religion then it is a fraud?\n \n 7. Evolution has been used as an excuse for atrocities such as racism, etc. Well, so has religion - no condoms to Africa, the Spanish Inquisition, rampant sexism, etc. So what? That doesn't affect the validity of the idea.\n\n \n Like a narrator you comment on each point, offering your own opinion why you disagree with them. But in typical fashion you don't actually refute one point with solid evidence of anything. So let me give commenting on each point made, a shot. OK? I quoted your response above so others can see how utterly shallow your commentary is. emoticon_xgood\n \n \n Seven Reasons Why Evolution is a Fraud\n \n 1. It's not science. You cannot observe, test and repeat the ever-changing ideas that are little more than wild speculation.This is the true and accepted definition of a true science, yet you only refer to the observable aspect of it while ignoring the testable and repeatable aspect of a valid and true science.\n 2. It devalues real science. Chemistry, physics and biology don't have the same problems of legitimacy because they are real sciences, not philosophical wannabes trying to appear legit.\n Your attempt to make an excuse which disregards this critique ignores the very accurate claim that rather than being a science, evolution is more a philosophy which makes assumptions not in evidence according to real science.\n 3. Complex engineering. Do you ever drive past a skyscraper and think to yourself 'Gee, I guess billions of years of random chance could have just as easily assembled all of that glass, steel and concrete as well as a team of engineers, architects, construction workers working from blueprints? Of course not! But that's what evolutionists would have you believe in when it comes to living organisms.\n You offer cliches like \"Tornados in a junkyard\" to marginalize a valid point while once again never actually showing that the statistical claims made are false. Is all we will get from you nothing more than cheap lip service as you insist you're right? \n \n 4. Genetics. The programming code of life, according to evolutionists, is just a series of biochemical accidents and mutations. If you believe this, I have a bridge in New York that's for sale. The infinitely complex engineering of this code means that it did not come about via 'natural selection,' aka random chance.\n Again, you repeat nonsense while actually refuting or disputing NOTHING here with facts which prove this statement wrong or factually incorrect.\n 5. Mathematically Impossible. Basic probability tells you that the odds of a blob of primordial ooze morphing into a man, regardless of how much time has passed, are so remote that mathematicians regard it as impossible. Emile Borel and Fred Hoyle are just two mathematicians who reject evolution on statistical grounds.\n Again, you offer shallow platitudes while proving nothing at all which refutes what my link says. Why is this in every response? Because there is no actual factual evidence anywhere which is undeniable and absolute with which to refute what is being said here. The Defender - Commentary\n 6. Evolution is a religion. Yes, evolution is the faith of atheism because it replaces God with man. When you've conned yourself into believing that some kind of ancient slime morphed into progressively complex and directional life forms, you are in the realm of faith, not science.\n So basically what I am to take away here is that all you have as a refutation for these 7 reasons why evolution is a fraud is the cliche that these are nothing more than a tornado in a junkyard, right? Because that is all you have offered in almost every response. How imaginative paulie.\n 7. Racism. This is the ugly secret that evolutionists don't want to discuss; that Darwin, Huxley and many of the early advocates of evolution stated publicly that Asians, Africans, Australian Aborigines and other non-white, non-European groups were evolutionary throwbacks. Darwin's cousin, Francis Galton, was a pioneer in the early field of eugenics which was the study of skills by ethnic groups. While Galton's work was relatively harmless, Hitler's work -- to synthesize natural selection by exterminating a race of people -- was not.\n \n And here I get the response that religion has done bad things also, so it's ok that evolution was founded on the principles of eugenics, racism and white superiority. But you can't deny the truth of it and what the roots of this philosophy represent. So to summarize, no refutation of anything said here. Just excuses via apologetics as you continue to ignore reality. \n ",

You may as well just throw out the Talk Origins talking points since they exist only to oppose any valid arguments against the lies which evolution promotes. What I did find interesting though was your posted experiment \"long-term evolution of E Coli\". \n \n I read the results and saw that no actual improvement or forward moving evolution resulted in a 20 year study spanning more than 40,000 generation. In fact, the results showed as many downsides resulting in the specimens. Here's the last paragraph of the results section of the page you quoted.\n Another adaption that occurred in all these bacteria was an increase in cell size and in many cultures, a more rounded cell shape.[5] This change was partly the result of a mutation that changed the expression of a gene for a penicillin binding protein, which allowed the mutant bacteria to out-compete ancestral bacteria under the conditions in the long-term evolution experiment. However, although this mutation increased fitness under these conditions, it also increased the bacteria's sensitivity to osmotic stress and decreased their ability to survive long periods in stationary phase cultures, so the phenotype of this adaption depends on the environment of the cells.\n These results speak for themselves and show that for 20 years work of manipulating these strains in laboratory conditions, all we had at the end was a weaker strain which was susceptible to osmotic stress which decreased their ability to survive long periods in stationary phase cultures. But never did the e coli evolve into a stronger or superior life form in any way. \n \n I marvel that you would even hold this example up as evidence that evolution is the least bit valid from a practical scientific perspective. Now had they taken these original strains and placed them in the wild, under totally natural conditions with no human intervention or manipulation at all, and they survived and changed in that completely wild and uncontrolled setting, now that would have been interesting.\n \n But you offer me a completely laboratory secure and a controlled setting which assures a perfect atmosphere, and in spite of those conditions we get no actual forward moving evolutionary results at all. Not that the results would have had any value if we had under those conditions. But hey, you will grasp at any straws to cling to your false religion.\n \n And one more thing. Micro-evolution is the adaptations and changes within a species while macro-evolution is the addition of new traits or a transition to a new species. Micro-evolution is a fact that is plainly observable throughout nature. Macro-evolution is a theory that has never been observed in science. The underlined is the great lie of evolution which we creationists reject. Macro-evolution is the great lie which proposes that one species of animal has evolved into other species of animals leading up to the evolution into human beings. \n \n This lie is what we oppose since we believe, no; WE KNOW that Man is above the animal kingdom since the point of creation as we were created in Gods image where as the animals were created to serve our needs.",

You may as well just throw out the Talk Origins talking points since they exist only to oppose any valid arguments against the lies which evolution promotes. What I did find interesting though was your posted experiment \"long-term evolution of E Coli\".\nYou see in my above post, where I predicted that you would discard the TalkOrigins website out of hand? Please note that I also rebutted your predicted discarding - because it's entirely hypocritical to discard a source based on the fact that it \"exists to oppose arguments against evolution\" when your arguments are from a site like EvoFraud, which exists to oppose evolution in the first place. Not that it matters where I get the arguments from, or where you get yours - the only important thing is the quality of the arguments themselves, which I have addressed and you have not.\n \n Furthermore, the large majority of my post was not from TalkOrigins at all. You haven't even addressed that with an arbitrary dismissal...\n \n \nWhat I did find interesting though was your posted experiment \"long-term evolution of E Coli\".\n ...\n But never did the e coli evolve into a stronger or superior life form in any way.\nThis bolded text is entirely and absolutely a lie.\n \n Firstly, there were plenty of alternative beneficial mutations. To quote from the article:\n \"Since the experiment's inception, Lenski and his colleagues have reported a wide array of genetic changes; some evolutionary adaptations have occurred in all 12 populations\n ...\n One particularly striking adaption was the evolution of a strain of E. coli that was able to grow on citric acid in the growth media.\n ...\n In the early years of the experiment, there were several common evolutionary developments shared by the populations. The mean fitness of each population, as measured against the ancestor strain, increased&#8212;rapidly at first, but leveling off after close to 20,000 generations (at which point they grew about 70% faster than the ancestor strain).\"\n \n Secondly, the single 'non-beneficial' mutation which you seize upon actually is beneficial. To quote the article itself: \"However, although this mutation increased fitness under these conditions, it also...\" The 'these conditions' mentioned in the quote are the conditions that the e coli was kept in during the experiment. That the mutation would have provided to be non-beneficial in an alternative environment is nothing other than a perfect example of how species can diversify and separate over time - an e coli without that mutation would have survived elsewhere, splitting the population and allowing for further mutations to further split the two groups. If you read the last part of the quote, it says 'the phenotype of the adaption relied on the environment of the cells'. To put this in non-science speak for you, the phenotype is whether the effects of a a gene are made apparent in the final organism or not. You can have the genotype for both blue and green eyes in your DNA (from your mother and father), but only the dominant one will result in your phenotype of green or blue. As such, this line is saying that in environments where this mutation was non-beneficial, the genotype with the mutation was suppressed so that the organism did not show that mutation, even though it had it. In other words; it was beneficial in the environment of the experiment, and the bacteria had further adapted so that if it was put in an alternate environment, the mutation was 'switched off'.\n \n \nNot that the results would have had any value if we had under those conditions.\nWhy not? It's a demonstration that evolution can be, and has been, tested.\n \n \nAnd one more thing. Micro-evolution is the adaptations and changes within a species while macro-evolution is the addition of new traits or a transition to a new species. Micro-evolution is a fact that is plainly observable throughout nature. Macro-evolution is a theory that has never been observed in science. The underlined is the great lie of evolution which we creationists reject. Macro-evolution is the great lie which proposes that one species of animal has evolved into other species of animals leading up to the evolution into human beings.\n'Macroevolution' is not going to be observed for quite some time - it takes longer than we've got to observe it. However, there are no arguments showing that microevolution does not lead to macroevolution, and there are several examples of species that are in the midway point of macroevolution - so-called ring species, where neighbouring populations of organisms in a band can breed with each other, but distant ones cannot.

   "Interesting article, the grammar and spelling could use some work. You theorize that all animals and even humans evolved directly or with very few intermediary phases from fish that emerged from the sea. And then you attempt to connect this theory to genesis 1\n , of course reinterpreting \"day\" to mean a long undefined period of time rather than a period of evening/morning cycle as the bible very clearly states. \n \n Nonetheless, the real problem I see with this theory is the lack of supporting evidence. You say that we have no reason to believe that man evolved from primates, because we have never found the missing link between species (even though we have many specimens that form a very gradual evolutionary chain). How do we then conclude that man must have evolved directly from fish species that walk out onto land? We have no signs of any such evolutionary chain at all. Your case is built upon the fact that human embryos resemble fish embryos, then rodent embryos, then humans, during fetal development. This is also the case with nearly all mammals, including apes, and very likely including extinct homonids. So the link between fish and man seems even more distant than that of man and ape. And it supports the idea, somewhat, that ALL lifeforms are derived from fish forms. However, it doesn't support your model. \n \n Imo, what you need to do is create a model that actually matches the real evidence we have, not create a model that matches your already formed beliefs, then only pick out pieces of evidence that fit with that model.\n\n \n \n well..\n \n if you take this basic model, and instead accept that man evolved not directly from apes, but along side it, from a group of common ancestors, which themselves are derived from fish.\n \n i.e.. there is a link between humans and apes...\n but there is no link between humans and bears.. and dogs...\n or between dogs and elephants...\n \n While yes... many species may of evolved over extermely long periods of time, and were around at the time of the Dinosaurs... and our ancestors may be traced back to there...\n \n The major species themselves... such as elephant.. and bear... are not related enough to be from a common ancestor.\n \n And.. we know as a fact that all land animals came from fish which crawled onto land... and we can presume that there were many many varieties of fish that rose onto land...\n \n we can easily see that those varieties are the reasons why there are no missing links between land animal species... and is why in the fossil record, some animals seem to just apear out of no where..\n \n \n yes... all land animals... evolve in the same way in the womb..\n \n if we were born at 4 weeks.. we would be a fish... as would all animals.. \n \n if at 5... we would be a rodent like creature...\n \n at 8.. we take on human form...\n \n other animals.. the lower ones.. go through this same process.. but they stop along the way into their present form, while we.. continue to develope into humaniods...\n \n \n The basic premise i propose is still good.. even if my delivery is alittle off.\n \n i wrote it many years ago, and it needs an update... to be sure.\n \n in essence, by recognising the application of qualitive energy, to a closed system, we can see how it would be applying pressure, like a constant screw twisting force, onto our genetic make up, so as to push our evolution... a predestined evolution along at a much faster pace than would be allowed for using mutations and natural selection...\n \n but the process is still linked to evolution processes, combined with mass extinctions which allow those with advantages to survive and continue to develop.\n \n an predestined evolution based creation, based on applied qualiative energy which pushed genetic transistions into ever more complex forms.\n \n -Mosheh Thezion ;)",

Then why, pray tell can't any of you refute me with actual absolute and undeniable evidence which will convince an allegedly ignorant skeptic like me that evolution is a valid science which is based in irrefutable facts? emoticon_rolleyes No answer huh! \n Just more lies, and denials that the evidence I do post is beyond you to deal with so you will all just come back and make believe I haven't posted any evidence or valid questions at all. Skulk away troll, you and your ignorant cohorts have no place in a serious debate. Until you can seriously and maturely deal with the actual arguments I present, I will just post more arguments in order to enlighten the objective observers of this thread.\n \n \nReally? What alleged massive fields of animal remains/fossils are currently being turned into future oil deposits, and where did they come from? How recent in geological terms were they deposited? Why must I always be subjected to unproven claims from your side as you sanctimoniously make these statements as if they are facts.\n \n It's your side which claims it takes millions upon millions of years for Oil and Coal Deposits to form, yet here you are pointing to them forming now as you expect me to take your unsubstantiated word for it.\n \n Really? And you have the nerve to claim to be the intelligent one between us? See the bolded? This is evidence of your denial of true reality as you make ridiculous assumptions which have absolutely no basis in fact at all. You are asserting than an animal has died, and slowly survives decomposition as a corpse, unmolested by scavengers long enough to be naturally covered by a naturally occurring layer of sand and earth which eventually become a distinct layer of strata.\n \n Then tell me paulie how this rabbit which was protected from scavengers didn't last past 8 days in reality in order to become a fossil? YouTube - Rabbit decomposition (time-lapse video)\n \n It is also undeniable which this link proves, The 1993 Midwest Floods and Rapid Canyon Formation that the very circumstances we are discussing have and do occur in very short periods of time via the flood process. I have shown from both ends with contemporary and undeniable evidence why my flood and decomposition perspective works in the real world as all you have offered is unsubstantiated insistence that you are right. And based on my evidence, your claims don't even pass the smell test.\n \n \n \n Not at all. When will you get it through your head that the very same evidence you observe which you believe supports your beliefs in an old earth, I observe as evidence that the Great Flood occurred, and a young earth is valid? We both have the same evidence paulie, I just interpret it differently than you do. So don't you dare attempt to claim some upper hand of scientific proof which I lack. All you have is your interpretation which erases God from the equation.\n \n Wrong again paulie, you have observations which you interpret to suggest those outcomes. Not one scientist who is expert in those fields would state categorically without question that the results which come to these conclusion are absolute and unchangeable. Or wont be redefined next month or next year based on new information. The very age of the Universe we inhabit has gone from 2 billion years old to the current estimate that it's 14.5 billion years old today, and just over the last 50 years. And it will inevitably change again as it is realized that more time is required for the theorized evolutionary process to result in we human beings as we exist today.\n \n And how interesting that it allegedly took hundreds of millions of years for us to evolve up to the level of Neanderthal according to your pseudo science, yet only between 40,000 and 100,000 years to evolve from the Neanderthal whom it has been shown that we share DNA with, to where we stand today as the apex life form on Earth which we are today. No practical answer for that inconsistency, huh paulie? \n \n It's incredible how many discrepancies and inconsistencies you can just ignore when they conflict with your preferred religion of secular humanist evolution.\n\n \n \nLike a narrator you comment on each point, offering your own opinion why you disagree with them. But in typical fashion you don't actually refute one point with solid evidence of anything. So let me give commenting on each point made, a shot. OK? I quoted your response above so others can see how utterly shallow your commentary is. emoticon_xgood\n \n \n Seven Reasons Why Evolution is a Fraud\n \n 1. It's not science. You cannot observe, test and repeat the ever-changing ideas that are little more than wild speculation.This is the true and accepted definition of a true science, yet you only refer to the observable aspect of it while ignoring the testable and repeatable aspect of a valid and true science.\n 2. It devalues real science. Chemistry, physics and biology don't have the same problems of legitimacy because they are real sciences, not philosophical wannabes trying to appear legit.\n Your attempt to make an excuse which disregards this critique ignores the very accurate claim that rather than being a science, evolution is more a philosophy which makes assumptions not in evidence according to real science.\n 3. Complex engineering. Do you ever drive past a skyscraper and think to yourself 'Gee, I guess billions of years of random chance could have just as easily assembled all of that glass, steel and concrete as well as a team of engineers, architects, construction workers working from blueprints? Of course not! But that's what evolutionists would have you believe in when it comes to living organisms.\n You offer cliches like \"Tornados in a junkyard\" to marginalize a valid point while once again never actually showing that the statistical claims made are false. Is all we will get from you nothing more than cheap lip service as you insist you're right? \n \n 4. Genetics. The programming code of life, according to evolutionists, is just a series of biochemical accidents and mutations. If you believe this, I have a bridge in New York that's for sale. The infinitely complex engineering of this code means that it did not come about via 'natural selection,' aka random chance.\n Again, you repeat nonsense while actually refuting or disputing NOTHING here with facts which prove this statement wrong or factually incorrect.\n 5. Mathematically Impossible. Basic probability tells you that the odds of a blob of primordial ooze morphing into a man, regardless of how much time has passed, are so remote that mathematicians regard it as impossible. Emile Borel and Fred Hoyle are just two mathematicians who reject evolution on statistical grounds.\n Again, you offer shallow platitudes while proving nothing at all which refutes what my link says. Why is this in every response? Because there is no actual factual evidence anywhere which is undeniable and absolute with which to refute what is being said here. The Defender - Commentary\n 6. Evolution is a religion. Yes, evolution is the faith of atheism because it replaces God with man. When you've conned yourself into believing that some kind of ancient slime morphed into progressively complex and directional life forms, you are in the realm of faith, not science.\n So basically what I am to take away here is that all you have as a refutation for these 7 reasons why evolution is a fraud is the cliche that these are nothing more than a tornado in a junkyard, right? Because that is all you have offered in almost every response. How imaginative paulie.\n 7. Racism. This is the ugly secret that evolutionists don't want to discuss; that Darwin, Huxley and many of the early advocates of evolution stated publicly that Asians, Africans, Australian Aborigines and other non-white, non-European groups were evolutionary throwbacks. Darwin's cousin, Francis Galton, was a pioneer in the early field of eugenics which was the study of skills by ethnic groups. While Galton's work was relatively harmless, Hitler's work -- to synthesize natural selection by exterminating a race of people -- was not.\n \n And here I get the response that religion has done bad things also, so it's ok that evolution was founded on the principles of eugenics, racism and white superiority. But you can't deny the truth of it and what the roots of this philosophy represent. So to summarize, no refutation of anything said here. Just excuses via apologetics as you continue to ignore reality. \n \n\n \n \nWOW, what a bunch of convoluted apologetic drivel. You may as well just throw out the Talk Origins talking points since they exist only to oppose any valid arguments against the lies which evolution promotes. What I did find interesting though was your posted experiment \"long-term evolution of E Coli\". \n \n I read the results and saw that no actual improvement or forward moving evolution resulted in a 20 year study spanning more than 40,000 generation. In fact, the results showed as many downsides resulting in the specimens. Here's the last paragraph of the results section of the page you quoted.\n Another adaption that occurred in all these bacteria was an increase in cell size and in many cultures, a more rounded cell shape.[5] This change was partly the result of a mutation that changed the expression of a gene for a penicillin binding protein, which allowed the mutant bacteria to out-compete ancestral bacteria under the conditions in the long-term evolution experiment. However, although this mutation increased fitness under these conditions, it also increased the bacteria's sensitivity to osmotic stress and decreased their ability to survive long periods in stationary phase cultures, so the phenotype of this adaption depends on the environment of the cells.\n These results speak for themselves and show that for 20 years work of manipulating these strains in laboratory conditions, all we had at the end was a weaker strain which was susceptible to osmotic stress which decreased their ability to survive long periods in stationary phase cultures. But never did the e coli evolve into a stronger or superior life form in any way. \n \n I marvel that you would even hold this example up as evidence that evolution is the least bit valid from a practical scientific perspective. Now had they taken these original strains and placed them in the wild, under totally natural conditions with no human intervention or manipulation at all, and they survived and changed in that completely wild and uncontrolled setting, now that would have been interesting.\n \n But you offer me a completely laboratory secure and a controlled setting which assures a perfect atmosphere, and in spite of those conditions we get no actual forward moving evolutionary results at all. Not that the results would have had any value if we had under those conditions. But hey, you will grasp at any straws to cling to your false religion.\n \n And one more thing. Micro-evolution is the adaptations and changes within a species while macro-evolution is the addition of new traits or a transition to a new species. Micro-evolution is a fact that is plainly observable throughout nature. Macro-evolution is a theory that has never been observed in science. The underlined is the great lie of evolution which we creationists reject. Macro-evolution is the great lie which proposes that one species of animal has evolved into other species of animals leading up to the evolution into human beings. \n \n This lie is what we oppose since we believe, no; WE KNOW that Man is above the animal kingdom since the point of creation as we were created in Gods image where as the animals were created to serve our needs.\n",

   "Arch, first you must convince us that the bible is the one true word of god other wise no one is going to listen to you.\n \n I can&#8217;t believe you don&#8217;t get that\n\n What is the logic or reason behind this ridiculous post accipiter? This is a debate forum kid. I am posting evidence which conflicts with your religion of evolution at every turn. The bible is my source of evidence. If it is so weak a source then you should have no problem refuting it with scientific sources which prove without doubt that macro-evolution has occurred in the animal kingdom.\n \n I'm not asking you to accept my evidence without giving you the opportunity to prove it's wrong with scientific sources. I'm asking for scientific sources which actually prove your repeated yet unproven claims that evolution is real. So for once in your life can you accept my challenge and just produce evidence that one species of an actual animal has evolved from one species to another which would prove that macro-evolution is possible? \n \n I am showing you that the bible directly and specifically states that macro-evolution cannot naturally occur in nature. If you want to prove the bible is an ancient sheep herders book of myths then I have made your job very easy by placing my cards face up on the table. Just prove with real evidence that any combination of any species of animal has evolved into any other species of animal and you win the debate. \n \n BTW, sorry if this frustrates you, but I'm repeating my prior post which still has been ignored by all of your religious evolutionists who worship at the alter of Darwin; which by the way is Idolatry, not atheism :) .\n \n emoticon_rolleyesemoticon_coolemoticon_rolleyes\n \n\n Gen 1:11 Then God said, \"Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, {and} fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit after their kind with seed in them\"; and it was so.\n Gen 1:12 The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit with seed in them, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.\n ====================================================================================================\n \n Gen 1:20 Then God said, \"Let the waters teem with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the heavens.\"\n Gen 1:21 God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind; and God saw that it was good.\n Gen 1:22 God blessed them, saying, \"Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.\"\n Gen 1:23 There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.\n Gen 1:24 Then God said, \"Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth after their kind\"; and it was so.\n Gen 1:25 God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good.\n Gen 1:26 Then God said, \"Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.\"\n Gen 1:27 God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.\n Gen 1:28 God blessed them; and God said to them, \"Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth.\"\n Gen 1:29 Then God said, \"Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree which has fruit yielding seed; it shall be food for you;\n Gen 1:30 and to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the sky and to every thing that moves on the earth which has life, {I have given} every green plant for food\"; and it was so.\n \n What is fascinating is that nobody is even attempting to actually refute my arguments. Like children, all you can do is mock that which you can't argue against with actual evidence. I am contributing to the content of this discussion with substantial and relevant questions and facts which require an answer if evolution is to be defended as a valid science. Yet all I can expect from the so called defenders is mockery and childish sniping. \n \n You wont even touch the meat of the verses above which remains as true today as they were on the day God spoke vegetation and animal life into existence and the plants yielding seeds \"after their own kind\" which is still the way our self sustaining and self perpetuating world works. Man may be involved in genetic manipulation, but not nature as each form of life stays with its own kind as animal life remains balanced and consistent as it was at the time of Creation. \n \n You people will post irrelevant and useless studies about e-coli supposedly evolving, yet after even 40,000 generations we see no evidence that it has evolved into anything more than another strain of e coli. Yet you posted it because you are impressed by its results when they prove nothing more than MICRO-EVOLUTION which we believers have referred to as \"Rapid Adaptation\" for years. And neither can you show that one species of animal has ever evolved into another species of animal even though you assert that macro-evolution is a reality. The same physical laws which God established when He spoke creation into existence still apply today. \n \n Now, you wont ever post actual positive observable or repeatable evidence that MACRO-EVOLUTION has ever occurred, yet you will respond to this post with your usual insults and mocking snipes which do nothing more than reveal your steadfast refusal to accept the true and real physical laws which are outlined in and have always applied in the Genesis account.\n",

   "The bible is my source of evidence. [boldface added]\n\n \n And the question is, why should those who reject either the Bible or at least your interpretation of it accept your source of evidence as their source of evidence?\n \n \nIf it is so weak a source then you should have no problem refuting it with scientific sources which prove without doubt that macro-evolution has occurred in the animal kingdom.\n\n \n The Biblical account is weak even on internal grounds. At Genesis 1:26, God is clearly depicted as creating human beings after the other animals. But in the second creation account -- which you have simply ommitted from consideration here -- God is clearly depicted as creating Adam before the other animals at Genesis 2:7. The two accounts are simply not compatible.\n \n So the burden of proof is on you to explain why people who think that the above is sheer nonsense when literalized should nonetheless accept it as literally true. Until then, I don't think you're going to have too many people accepting it as \"evidence.\"\n \n \nI'm not asking you to accept my evidence without giving you the opportunity to prove it's wrong with scientific sources. I'm asking for scientific sources which actually prove your repeated yet unproven claims that evolution is real. So for once in your life can you accept my challenge and just produce evidence that one species of an actual animal has evolved from one species to another which would prove that macro-evolution is possible?\n\n \n I sometimes get the impression that the only evidence you and many other creationists would accept is thousands upon thousands of years of video, recording how species change over time. That is of course not going to happen. Ergo, evolutionists can't prove their case. QED\n \n Never you mind that this sort of \"problem\" would render history and archaeology and forensics impossible. It renders creationism impossible to verify as well. The epistemological bar has been set so high at this point that literally no account of the past could surmount it.\n \n \nI am showing you that the bible directly and specifically states that macro-evolution cannot naturally occur in nature.\n\n \n No, that's what you say. The Bible merely states that animals reproduce \"after their kinds.\" Which, of course, every evolutionist on earth will happily grant you.\n \n You don't seem very familiar with the ways in which evolution problematizes the whole notion of \"species\" in the first place. Each generation is sufficiently similar to both its ancestors and descendents that they could all interbreed (barring something very unusual). But over thousands or millions of generations, differences can accumulate such that a very early generation may bear little resemblance to a much later one, and the two may be unable to interbreed.\n \n Moreover, it is quite readily observable in nature that many organisms do not reproduce after their own kind. Unrelated bacteria engage in \"lateral gene transfer\" between species, and there is evidence that this may happen in eukaryotic organisms, as well. Many plants will quite naturally hybridize with plants of other species, and the hybrids that are produced are often fertile, capable of reproducing with one or both parent species or with each other. There is even evidence that fertile hybridization occurs more frequently than previously realized in the animal kingdom, especially among invertebrates and fish.\n \n So leave to one side the issue of continuity and change over time. The idea that organisms are naturally limited to reproducing \"after their kinds\" is simply false, and this is readily observable in the here and now. If you want to make a big deal out of that phrase, then you have a massive empirical problem on your hands.\n \n \nBTW, sorry if this frustrates you, but I'm repeating my prior post which still has been ignored...\n\n \n Because it's completely irrelevant.\n \n \n...by all of your religious evolutionists who worship at the alter of Darwin; which by the way is Idolatry.\n\n \n Evolution is not a religion. It's a natural science that seeks to understand the origins of organisms via natural processes based on empirical evidence from field and experiment. Does this have implications for religion? You bet. Does it make evolution a religion? Not at all.\n \n Meanwhile, as far as idolatry goes, I think the most common form in America is the substitution of the Bible for God.",

   "The singular argument that Archangel clings to is that macroevoution has not been directly observed. All his other arguments have been stripped away from him - his response is either to pretend that they didn't happen (eg: claiming that the e coli never became stronger during the experiment) or to simply ignore the responses to them and repost his original text (eg: ignoring the entirety of this post and ignoring almost all of this one, which between them answer every problem he has come up with since his \\'seven evidences of EvoFraud\\' post).\n \n In fact, I've even (in the first of those linked posts) explained the problem with demanding direct observations of 'macroevolution'. I'll do it again though in more detail, because it's an interesting tale.\n \n Right from the start, a big creationist argument against evolution was that it had never been observed. Then someone pointed out that selective breeding is a form of evolution, so the argument was quickly reduced to two forms, which persisted until quite recently (I have seen, and argued against, both).\n Firstly, there was an argument that selective breeding didn't actually produce any new genetic information. The theory ran that God had created wolves with loads of different genes for height, colour etc and all the breeders were doing was breeding dogs that eliminated some of those genes; making the dog more and more a 'pure-bred'. This argument was destroyed by the appearance of animals such as panda shepherds, where a new gene was specifically noted as mutating into existence between generations.\n The second argument was that all this 'evolution within a species' stuff was somehow irrelevant to the truth of evolution itself - what the creationists now demanded was direct observations of evolution from one species into another - a term dubbed 'macroevolution'. However, since that argument arose there have been several confirmed examples of speciation - both speciation in action (as exampled by the ring species linked to in my previous post) and examples of entirely new species arising. A decent list of some new species is here (yes, Archangel, it's TalkOrigins. However, please note that every single example is cited to an academic paper). So the creationist argument had to backpedal again. And now we find ourselves at Archangels last hope; that because 'macroevolution' - which now apparently means \"a reptile has evolved into a mammal, or that a mammal has evolved into a bird\" - has never been directly observed, evolution as a whole must be false.\n \n However, this is clearly an absurd demand. Macroevolution - evolution on a scale larger than a species, has been directly observed - see that link to the list of evidences of speciation. The greatly exaggerated demand for an observed case of 'reptile to bird' is very clearly a straw man, as the evolutionary model itself states that such changes occur over hundreds of thousands of years - and written records haven't been about for that long, never mind documented scientific studies. So rubbishing evolution on the fact that such large transitions have never been directly observed is pointless, because the theory itself states that such transitions occur over a longer period than humanity has been about for. It's like saying that Jesus doesn't exist because you can't find him in the 1908 census data for east London.\n \n 'Microevolution' has been directly observed. Speciation - as a result of prolonged microevolution - has been directly observed. The larger transitions are simply extentions of those two observed principles; and as I said in my previous (ignored) post, there is no argument that the extention is not a valid one.\n \n There is also fossil evidence of such large transitions, which has been linked to many times and which Archangel has, unsurprisingly, dismissed out of hand.\n \n You're out of arguments, Archangel.

I'm not asking you to accept it as valid evidence. I'm posting it as valid evidence and asking you to refute it with actual scientific evidence that one species of animal has EVER evolved into another species of animal. In this whole diatribe you still haven't produced any real evidence of any claim you make.\n \n \nThe Biblical account is weak even on internal grounds.

Start another debate if you want to discuss the reason the two chapters say what they do, but for now, just offer proof that MACRO-EVOLUTION HAS OCCURRED, IN OPPOSITION TO WHAT THIS ALLEGEDLY CONFLICTING ACCOUNT SAYS, PERIOD!!!\n \n \nI sometimes get the impression that the only evidence you and many other creationists would accept is thousands upon thousands of years of video, recording how species change over time. That is of course not going to happen. Ergo, evolutionists can't prove their case. QED\n\n \n Again with ridiculous and juvenile assertions. You seem to have no problem producing reams of volumes of convoluted and contradictory conclusions which fail to hold up under the most basic scrutiny, yet with the complete fossil record which you hold up as evidence that evolution is allegedly a valid science, YOU NOW ADMIT FOR ALL TO SEE THAT YOU CAN'T PROVE MACRO-EVOLUTION IS A FACT. FINALLY WE GET ONE HONEST ADMISSION FROM AN EVOLUTIONIST EVEN THOUGH HE WILL NOW DENY THAT'S WHAT HE MEANT TO SAY. \n \n \nNever you mind that this sort of \"problem\" would render history and archaeology and forensics impossible. It renders creationism impossible to verify as well. The epistemological bar has been set so high at this point that literally no account of the past could surmount it.\n\n \n Balderdash and foolish bluster. That's all you offer. You may consider the evidentiary bar to be set too high to reach but I have no doubts or problems at all with my evidence. It's a no brainer that the Genesis account is the absolute and undeniable truth which will be born out when the eternal truth is known to each of us.\n \n \nNo, that's what you say. The Bible merely states that animals reproduce \"after their kinds.\" Which, of course, every evolutionist on earth will happily grant you.\n\n \n Really? Then you are admitting that MACRO-EVOLUTION has never occurred at all? that evolution is based on the higher forms of biological life which currently fills the earth didn't all evolve from simple celled organisms going back billions of years in earths distant past? Is that what you're admitting here Matthew, my alleged christian brother? emoticon_xdonno\n \n \nMoreover, it is quite readily observable in nature that many organisms do not reproduce after their own kind. Unrelated bacteria engage in \"lateral gene transfer\" between species, \n\n \n Really? Then they evolve and are no longer bacteria? Or are they another genus of bacteria!!! Which is it and support your answer with actual evidence rather than unsupported claims.\n \n \n and there is evidence that this may happen in eukaryotic organisms, \n\n \n You're speaking nonsense and gibberish which proves you have no idea what you are saying. All living organisms are composed of cells. A eukaryotic cell is a cell with a nucleus, which contains the cell's chromosomes. Plants, animals, protists, and fungi have eukaryotic cells, unlike the Eubacteria and Archaea, whose cells do not have nuclei and are therefore termed prokaryotic. In addition to having a nucleus, eukaryotic cells differ from prokaryotic cells in being larger and much more structurally and functionally complex. Eukaryotic cells contain subcompartments called organelles, which carry out specialized reactions within their boundaries. A eukaryotic cell may be an individual organism, such as the amoeba, or a highly specialized part of a multicellular organism, such as a neuron.\n \n \n as well. Many plants will quite naturally hybridize with plants of other species, and the hybrids that are produced are often fertile, capable of reproducing with one or both parent species or with each other. \n\n \n Who are you trying to deceive Matt, yourself or me? Or is it the observers who read these threads? Beside the fact that once again you have just offered cheap lip service but evidence of nothing at all. You are apparently not smart enough to appreciate that all plants are of the same KIND of organism so for rapid adaptation to occur in the wild isn't macro-evolution by any standard of the term. \n \n Show me evidence that a plant has evolved into, let's say an insect and I'll be impressed. That is what macro-evolution claims has led to the advent of the human being after all. And that is the crux of this debate.\n \n \nThere is even evidence that fertile hybridization occurs more frequently than previously realized in the animal kingdom, especially among invertebrates and fish.\n\n \n Really? Then what other species of animals do the invertebrates evolve into? And what other species of amphibian, reptile or land mammal have fish evolved into? And why are you just claiming this rather than posting the evidence which will put this debate to rest forever? Why are you expecting me to take your unsubstantiated word for this in a debate where facts are required as evidence for your claims?\n \n \nSo leave to one side the issue of continuity and change over time. The idea that organisms are naturally limited to reproducing \"after their kinds\" is simply false, and this is readily observable in the here and now. If you want to make a big deal out of that phrase, then you have a massive empirical problem on your hands.\n\n \n And yet you haven't produced one iota of evidence to support your unsubstantiated assertions here. Real impressive brother. You're no better an advocate for your religion of evolution than you are for your religion of christianity. emoticon_xgood\n \n \nEvolution is not a religion. It's a natural science that seeks to understand the origins of organisms via natural processes based on empirical evidence from field and experiment. Does this have implications for religion? You bet. Does it make evolution a religion? Not at all.\n \n Meanwhile, as far as idolatry goes, I think the most common form in America is the substitution of the Bible for God.\n\n \n Balderdash! It's a philosophically based religion which requires more faith to accept than my monotheistic belief in the God of Israel. And Darwin's book,\" On the Origin of Species\" is your bible. Just remember Matthew, you cannot serve two masters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.

   "Archangel, you seem to be confusing the term species with the term class. This handy link might help you along your way - class is mammal/reptile/fish etc, order is different types of a certain class (eg different types of mammal), then family is different types of a certain order and genus is different types of a certain family. \n \n Finally, you get to species, which is different types of genus. For example, Canis is the name for a genus containing the different species wolves, jackels, dogs and coyotes - all of which are of the class 'mammal'. Macroevolution in the biological sense generally involves one species becoming another, not one class becoming another. In macroevolution, the species a mammal macroevolves into... is often another mammal, or a different species. For example, wolves almost macroevolved into the different breeds of dog ('almost' because wolves and dogs are a step further down the list as they are different subspecies, so it's not quite). However, as my link in the previous (ignored - again!) post will show you, there are several observed cases of true macroevolution - for example, different species of mosquitoes.\n \n It's only on enormously long timescales that you get evolution between classes - and humanity hasn't been around that long.

For a thorough explanatory context, see the history of Earth, and geologic time scale. The dates given in this article are estimates based on scientific evidence.\n In biology, evolution is the process by which populations of organisms acquire and pass on novel traits from generation to generation. Its occurrence over large stretches of time explains the origin of new species and ultimately the vast diversity of the biological world. Contemporary species are related to each other through common descent, products of evolution and speciation over billions of years.\n Basic timeline:\n \n The basic timeline is a 4.6 billion year old Earth, with (very approximately):\n * 4 billion years of simple cells (prokaryotes),\n * 3 billion years of photosynthesis,\n * 2 billion years of complex cells (eukaryotes),\n * 1 billion years of multicellular life,\n * 600 million years of simple animals,\n * 570 million years of arthropods (ancestors of insects, arachnids and crustaceans)\n * 550 million years of complex animals\n * 500 million years of fish and proto-amphibians,\n * 475 million years of land plants,\n * 400 million years of insects and seeds,\n * 360 million years of amphibians,\n * 300 million years of reptiles,\n * 200 million years of mammals,\n * 150 million years of birds,\n * 130 million years of flowers,\n * 65 million years since the non-avian dinosaurs died out,\n * 2.5 million years since the appearance of Homo,\n * 200,000 years since humans started looking like they do today,\n * 25,000 years since Neanderthals died out.\n \n Can you appreciate that all I want is actual evidence that this fairy tale is real and true?

   "With all due respect Iangb, you are a blatant liar. just as smiley's post above quotes one irrelevant sentence from my post in order to cast an insult at me, and by irrelevant I mean that it isn't about an on topic issue, so has every response except for yours which was a non answer to the 7 reasons why evolution is a fraud not dealt with anything I have argued at all. No real or hard evidence has been proffered which proves that any \"macro-evolution\" has ever occurred. \n\n It has. As has been repeatedly pointed out to you, you've ignored it.\n \n \nNone of the repeated points I have raised have been answered with any absolute or undeniable evidence at all.\n\n They have. As has been repeatedly pointed out to you, you've ignored them\n \n \nSure, I've gotten a lot of insults and snarky retorts,\n\n Which is better than you deserve, but I digress.\n \n \nbut not any substantial or seriously believable proof that any animal has ever crawled out of the ocean as a fish and survived long enough to turn into a mammal.\n\n Wait, what?!? Do you honestly expect, if evolution is true, to see a fish flop onto land and grow legs and fur?\n \n \nAnd let's face it, that is the crux of what evolution teaches occurred in order for land mammals to have led to primates and then to we human beings.\n\n That's not only not in the same ballpark as what the ToE states, it's not even on the same planet!\n \n \nI mean, we all know what evolution claims\n\n We all know. You, however, seem intent on claiming something else.\n \n \n here's a timeline for you imbeciles who need a primer for what you're supposed to actually believe\n\n Who was just whining about insults?\n \n \nfrom a link you would respect under any other circumstances.\n\n Yes, we routinely quote Russian dictionaries...\n \n \nOf course, now that I have posted it, I'm sure you'll reject it also.\n\n Why? At a quick glance, it looks correct. \n \n \n \nCan you appreciate that all I want is actual evidence that this fairy tale is real and true?\n\n Can you appreciate that actual evidence has been given to you, and that you've consistently, blatantly ignored it?\n \n \nThat when you look in the mirror tonight, you are actually looking at the distant relative of a fish or a proto-amphibian. Now is that asking too much?\n\n And remember that according to your fairy tale, you're looking at some wet dust that a magical sky fairy blew on.\n \n \nThe only fact that is relevant for the sake of this debate is that the e coli remained e coli after more than 40,000 generations and 20 years of evolution. \n\n And what would you expect? That it would sprout legs and discuss Descartes? This is not a failing of the ToE, it's a failing of your understanding of the ToE\n \n \nAll that needs to be pointed out in response to the links you have posted is that the alleged new species evolved from within their own species of creature. What did that mosquito evolve from if not from another mosquito, you simpleton?\n\n Another instult \n \n \nAnd what did the Panda Shepherd evolve from if not another dog? And what part did the breeder play in that breeding? So It wasn't any type of natural evolution, was it! \n\n But it was evolution, wasn't it? According to your own link:\n \"volution is the process by which populations of organisms acquire and pass on novel traits from generation to generation.\"\n \n \nYou people are so hungry for evidence\n\n Nope, there is ample evidence. More than I could read and understand in my lifetime, I would imagine.\n \n \nthat you're not deluding yourselves with this fairy tale,\n\n Says the guy who believes a book of magic written by bronze age shepherds and nomads\n \n \nman made religion\n\n Nope. No matter how many times you say it, it doesn't make it true.\n \n \n[ which seeks to show how we got here apart from an intelligent creator God\n\n Nope, again, from your own link:\n \"volution is the process by which populations of organisms acquire and pass on novel traits from generation to generation. Its occurrence over large stretches of time explains the origin of new species and ultimately the vast diversity of the biological world.\"\n huh, no mention of god...\n \n \nthat you will cling to dogs with Panda coloring and mosquitos which weren't previously identified.\n\n Who's clinging? Iangb gave you a couple of good examples of speciation, on the mistaken understanding that you were actually interested in the answer\n \n \nIf it wasn't so sad and pathetic, it would be funny. And you guys actually think you're the smart ones. The intellectuals, the scientific and rational minds. emoticon_xgood\n\n Someone help me out here, there's got to be a word or phrase to describe the phenomena of someone consistently labeling others with their own faults.",

Effective Arguments For Disproving Biblical CreationEverything else written has been personal attacks and non responses to the arguments I have posted.

If I'm innorant, then that must mean you all are stupid. And yes, I know the correct spelling is ignorant. emoticon_xdonno\n \n \nMy favourite would be the fact that we can see objects in space which are more than 8,000 light years away. The (initial) common creationist response to this is that the speed of light 'must' have changed over time - however, there are several disproofs for this. \n The first is simple - there is a great amount of evidence that this is not the case: at the very most, it has not changed by very much.. \n Even better than that, however, is the case of Supernova 1987A. This supernova was surrounded by distant rings of gas which could be observed 'lighting up' as the light from the supernova hit it. The rings were big enough for an angular width to be measured (0.808 arcseconds diameter), and the time taken for the light to get from the central 'nova to the rings was measured. Basic trigonometry gives the result that, regardless of the current speed of light, the event took place 168,000 years ago. You might be able to get around this by making some headache-inducing assumptions, but (unsurprisingly, really) independent methods of distancing the supernova puts it at 168,000 light-years away, thus nicely supporting the observations made.\n",

   "@Archangel (response to this post)\n \nWith all due respect Iangb, you are a blatant liar. just as smiley's post above quotes one irrelevant sentence from my post in order to cast an insult at me, and by irrelevant I mean that it isn't about an on topic issue, so has every response except for yours which was a non answer to the 7 reasons why evolution is a fraud not dealt with anything I have argued at all.\nCall me arrogant if you will, but that is pretty close to what I meant. You posted some arguments and several people posted responses. Of those, some were very relevant (Matthews, for example), but only mine directly contradicted your scientific points; Matthews post was excellent, but more theological in some places. Several other posts, I agree, added nothing to the thread. However, out of all those responses, which ones did you turn your attention to? Largely, you responded to the off-topic ones, the irrelevant ones and the insulting ones. You also responded to Matthews post, but mostly (until now) ignored mine - despite the fact that you still claimed that 'no-one had countered your arguments'. This simply wasn't true - and because you hadn't responded to any of my posts, my posts stood unchallenged, unlike your points, which I had challenged.\n \n You've now mentioned some of my posts, but only with an ad hom-esque dismissal. How were they 'non-answers'? As far as I could tell, they answered your points pretty comprehensively, complete with examples. Like you said above - if my arguments are so weak (first paragraph), it should be easy for you to rebut them, yes?\n \n *************************\n \n The entirety of the rest of your post deals with the 'macroevolution' problem which I discussed previously. I think a solution to it would be if you first posted your definition of 'macroevolution', as yours is clearly quite different from others I have seen.\n \n Yes, the e coli remained an e coli, just as the dog remained a dog and the mosquito remained a mosquito (although remember, the dog started out as a wolf). However, for the mosquito this isn't particularly relevant to macroevolution as most biologists use the term - that is, when an animal evolves from one species into another. 'Mosquito is the name for a family of insects; certainly not a species, but not even a genus - there are 41 different genera (plural of genus) of mosquito, and ~3500 different species. So the emergent mosquitoes that my TalkOrigins link mentioned were still an entirely new species, despite the fact that they were still 'mosquitoes'.\n \n The dog and e coli were not claimed examples of speciation (macroevolution, as I am using the term), so the fact that they weren't new species irrelevant (the e coli may have been considered as such, but I can't be bothered to go and check; like I said, it's irrelevant).\n \n It's back to you then, to define 'macroevolution'. But to pre-empt whatever you might say, some responses.:[*]If 'macroevolution' is 'evolution between species', then this challenge has been met by the mosquitoes.[*]If 'macroevolution' means simply that the name of the animal has changed, then my response would be that what the name of an animal is is irrelevant. This is the same line of thinking that describes something as specifically a 'transitional form', rather than the truth; all animals are transitional forms, between their parents and their offspring. The name will change when the higher-level changes become more distinct, but that won't happen for a while yet - it's the same as my response to 'class'. Also, 'wolf' ---< 'dog'. That's a name change, yes?[*]If 'macroevolution' means 'evolution between classes' (eg fish to bird, or mammal to reptile) then it has already been explained to you why this will not be directly observed in our lifetime. However, there is plenty of fossil evidence on the progression of, for example, dinosaurs to birds. I can link you to it if you promise not to discard it without providing a valid reason for doing so.\n NB: this definition of macroevolution would include your \"when you look in the mirror tonight, you are actually looking at the distant relative of a fish or a proto-amphibian\" definition.\n I'd finish by saying that your exaggerated challenges are becoming increasingly irrelevant to the truth of evolution itself. If it turns out that the evolutionary chain of Animal X was slightly incorrect, this doesn't mean that evolution itself is wrong.",

   "Moving on from the troll who only wants to derail another debate. I refer you to this link from post 145 http://www.4forums.com/political/366906-post145.html which has been ignored by the opposition, as usual. It offers the statistical evidence against what evolution proposes being mathematically possible. This is a consideration evolutionists just hate to consider which is why they will attack it with some link to Talk Origin rather than disprove its validity with valid mathematical statistics of their own. Here's an excerpt.\n Science Debunks Evolution\n Tom Phillips\n \n There has been much propaganda regarding the \"intelligent design\" controversy. In truth, creation/design is the scientific position; evolution is unscientific. By definition, science is based upon what we observe in the physical world and logical inference from what we observe.\n \n While microevolution --change within a species-- is observed and scientific, macroevolution, what \"evolution\" customarily means, is not. It asserts life somehow arose from non-life by chance. Such \"spontaneous generation,\" disproven long ago, has never been observed. Instead, we always observe that life comes from previous life --and, as Scripture teaches, ultimately from an ever-living God. Evolution also asserts one life form can change into another, higher form --something also never observed, and thus unscientific. Instead, we always observe exactly what Genesis 1 states numerous times: life reproduces \"according to its kind\" (vv. 11,12,21,24,25,29) --i.e., cats beget cats, crickets beget crickets, etc. They never change into something else. With microbiology we understand why.\n \n All life contains DNA, a genetic blueprint containing information. But purely material processes cannot create information, which originates only from a \"mind.\"(1) Evolution proceeds via chance, the antithesis of information. The DNA in simple bacteria has several million specifications; man's has several billion.(2) The DNA molecule, the most complex structure we know, and unquestionably the most efficient copying device, with self-correcting processes, prevents one life form from \"changing\" into another. We are all copies of a copy of a copy, etc., going back to the very first human parents. Genesis 3:20 says Eve was \"the mother of all the living.\" Science proved we are descendents of one woman, whose genes are carried by all mankind. Newsweek's 1-11-88 cover article (\"Searching for Adam and Eve\") states: \"all modern men and women descended from this relatively recent woman whom scientists have taken to calling Eve.\"(3) Even evolutionists accept this finding, based on the DNA in our mitochondria, the cell's powerhouse.(4) Mitochondrial DNA comes unmixed, only from the mother; \"it preserves a family record that isn't scrambled every generation.\"(5)\n \n The fossil record disproves evolution. If the first life form changed into another, higher form by gradual gene changes, and so on down the line, accounting for all life, then, quoting Darwin, \"the number of intermediate and transitional links, between all living and extinct species, must have been inconceivably great.\"(6) The whole world would be awash in the remains of \"infinitely numerous connecting links.\"(7) It isn't. Darwin conceded that fact, calling it \"the most obvious and serious objection\" against his theory.(8) He attests the \"sudden appearance\" of species, complete and distinct, in the fossil record(9) --just as if God created all life individually.\n \n Evolution is scientifically preposterous. Laws of probability are real scientific laws. Our DNA is \"unique\" because the odds of another person having our exact DNA are so remote we can dismiss that possibility altogether. Likewise with evolution. Nobel laureate Francis Crick calculated nature's chances of producing one small protein: 1 in 10 to the 260th power.(10) Crick reminds us there are only 10 to the 80th power (1 followed by 80 zeros) atoms in the whole universe(11); he concludes even the elementary components of life \"cannot have arisen by pure chance.\"(12) Mathematician Emile Borel states an event will never happen when the odds are less than 1 in 10 to the 50th power.(13) Sir Fred Hoyle calculated nature's chances of producing the 2000 enzymes found in life: 1 in 10 to the 40,000th power.(14) He states: \"The Darwinian theory of evolution is shown to be plainly wrong.\"(15) He concludes: \"Life cannot have had a random beginning(16)...but must have come from a cosmic intelligence.\"(17) Nobel laureate Ernst Chain said: \"To postulate that the development and survival of the fittest is entirely a consequence of chance mutations seems to me a hypothesis based on no evidence and irreconciliable with the facts.\"(18) Einstein said, \"I want to know how God created this world.\"(19) Einstein knew the universe didn't happen by chance.\n \n Atheism and evolution are dead. Science destroyed them. Those claiming evolution is \"scientific\" must demonstrate that life can come from non-life by purely material processes, and that one life form can turn into another, higher form. Science demands it. Put up or shut up! The Defender - Commentary\n \n I must also comment on this Tornado in a Junk yard analogy you have scoffed at in order to oppose my position against evolution which was originally coined by Sir Fred Hoyle, who used it in Evolution From Space: A Theory of Cosmic Creationsim (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1981), p 24. \n \n Hoyle said that the chance that life forms might have emerged in this way is comparable with the chance that \"a tornado sweeping through a junk-yard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein.\" --Nature, Nov 12, 1981 p 105.\n \n Why doesn't anyone on your side show the statistical probabilities that such a miraculous event of evolution occurring as stated by your religious proponents? It's because the numbers are too vast for you to imagine, and you don't want to deal with that reality. emoticon_xgood",

   "Hey, wow, I missed a link.\n \n Unfortunately, Archangel, your timing is really bad. I'm about half an hour away from moving an hour up the motorway into a new flat, which is unlikely to have the internet for a week and a half or so. I may come back here after the weekend, but I probably won't be online until that point. Don't think I've forgotten you!\n \n Very quickly before I go, a brief post:\n \n To start with, could you respond to my previous post and define what 'macroevolution' means to you? The quoted article in your post above gives yet another definition, which I will rubbish shortly.\n \n Now... your link: a brief dissemination. I'll probably try and bulk it up a bit when I have time next week if needed, this is just some initial responses without research, calculations or nuthin'. \n \n First paragraph: Rambling without any proof. Presumably proof is to follow\n \n Second paragraph: This jumps straight into the 'misunderstandings' pool when it states that 'macroevolution means spontanious generation of life from non-life'. This is entirely false: life from non-life is abiogenesis, which is irrelevant to the truth of evolution. God could have created that 'life from non-life' in the first place, which then went on to evolve into us (not that I believe this; but it's hypothetically true).\n The second paragraph also mentions an animal evolving into another animal. Presumably it doesn't mean 'a new species emerging', as this has been documented. Instead, it must mean the second of my 'macroevolution' definitions in my above post - simply that the name has changed. It's a fairly silly argument: technically, the new species of mosquito had a name: \"Mosquito species B\" as opposed to \"mosquito species Z\". As did the panda shepherds, mutated from German shepherd (I seem to remember, no time to check). Furthermore, if the name did change you could simply go higher up the naming tree and claim that it hadn't met your standards: A wolf evolving into a dog is still a canine, or a monkey evolving into a man is still a mammal. Heck, you could go for \"a dino evolving into a bird is still a vertibrate, this changes nothing!\" \n In short, I still need that detailed definition of macroevolution from you, Archie.\n \n Third paragraph: This refers to the 'losing genetic information' argument that I was talking about two or three posts ago: arguing that each generation simply has less information than the previous one. As I said before, this is directly contradicted by the panda shepherds and their new, mutation-formed gene. There are a fair few other examples of new information being created, but again I don't have time to link to them. TalkOrigins would know, if you dare to look.\n \n Fourth paragraph: I even mentioned this argument in passing: it makes the claim that we should be finding more of what it dubs 'transitional fossils'. However, this ignores the fact that all fossils are transitional, between their parents and their offspring. It's simply that there are some gaping holes in the fossil record; unsurprising, when you consider how unlikely it is that an animal will become fossilised rather than eaten. Furthermore, the paragraph is out of date, especially with it's quotes; most of the evolutionary history of most of the animals existent today have been traced back through 'transitional' fossils. There have been a lot more fossils found recently, as techniques are improving and - more importantly - people are actually getting funding to go out and look for them (perhaps unsurprisingly, this boom in research grants came just after the first jurassic park film came out).\n \n Fifth paragraph: Now we come to the newer stuff, the maths. Ironically this is the paragraph that I'm going to have least time to do anything on, as the paragraph itself doesn't mention specific methodologies (though they may be mentioned in the citations), so I can't dispute them until I know what they are, which I will do when I get the chance. I can guess, though - the mathematician looked at the pattern of atoms in the carbon molecules and calculated the probability that, if he were to choose atoms at random from an appropriate sample size, he'd pick them in exactly the right order - which is vanishingly small. However, this ignores the fact that this isn't how the molecules formed. Like all carbon-based chemicals, they formed by a series of joinings, where each one was governed by physical laws. For example, I can react bromine with propene and be guarenteed to get propane 1-bromide (or something with a similar name, it's been a while since I did any chemistry) - despite the fact that all there are 11 atoms in propane 1-bromide, of 3 different types - and if I were to pick atoms at random like the mathematician did, that makes it a fairly small chance that I'd end up with the right molecule. Proof of God at work, or simply evidence of intramolecular forces?\n I'd just add to this that Hoyle, along with your other quotes, are back to discussion abiogenesis, not evolution. As pointed out earlier, there's a big difference.\n \n Fifth paragraph: Back to the rambling of the first paragraph, although the error here is that the author linked 'evolution' with 'atheism'. You can have atheistic creationists (Jakers), just as you can have theistic evolutionists (Matthew) - the two are independent of each other.\n \n Finally, your comment on the 'tornado in a junk yard'. That Hoyle came up with the wording is irrelevant: Hoyle is the bloke who did the maths above, so he was likely to say this. This simply further refutes Hoyle's maths - he assumes that there were no extra laws governing evolution (or abiogenesis, which is what the quote was originally pertaining to). Secondly, Hoyle used the 'tornado in a junkyard' analogy to suggest that order cannot come from disorder. The very analogy disproves that: what else is a tornado, if not an ordered coming-together of the winds which 'should' be impossible if approached from a purely mathematical angle which disregards all the other rules? Take all the air particles, calculate the chance that each individual one has the appropriate vector of motion and you will get a vanishingly small chance that tornadoes exist, just as Hoyle got a tiny chance that ammino acids would 'spontaniously' form. Both Hoyle and the tornado mathematician would be ignoring the fact that there are interatomic forces which can cause order to arise from chaos.",

Unfortunately for you, they are sadly lacking specificity in stating what alleged flaws he commits in his statistical paradigm. Here is what your link says.\n \n \nAccording to Ian Musgrave in Lies, Damned Lies, Statistics, and Probability of Abiogenesis Calculations:\n \n These people, including Fred, have committed one or more of the following errors.\n They calculate the probability of the formation of a \"modern\" protein, or even a complete bacterium with all \"modern\" proteins, by random events. This is not the abiogenesis theory at all.\n \n They assume that there is a fixed number of proteins, with fixed sequences for each protein, that are required for life.\n \n They calculate the probability of sequential trials, rather than simultaneous trials.\n \n They misunderstand what is meant by a probability calculation.\n \n They seriously underestimate the number of functional enzymes/ribozymes present in a group of random sequences.\n\n \n Your link also says this.\n \n \nHoyle's fallacy is rejected by all evolutionary biologists.\n\n \n Well no kidding that evolutionary biologists would reject a statistical calculation which completely invalidates their lifes work as impossible to have occurred. \n \n And in looking at the 5 points made above which are meant to nullify the value of Hoyles calculations we see more sanctimonious condescension by those who played no part in actually running the equations yet feel qualified to critique them based on more unsupported conclusions which are not proven to be true anywhere at all. Let's go through each critique point by point and consider its relevance. \n They calculate the probability of the formation of a \"modern\" protein, or even a complete bacterium with all \"modern\" proteins, by random events. This is not the abiogenesis theory at all.\n Actually it is. The end result of what abiogenesis claims is that from the basic original building blocks which came to exist in the primordial ooze through which all life on earth grew, to what is all modern proteins and complicated bacterium, allegedly resulted from those humble beginnings. So the calculation must include the journey from that beginning to the present result.\n They assume that there is a fixed number of proteins, with fixed sequences for each protein, that are required for life.\n I can't speak to the accuracy of this claim, but if it's correct, it works in the evolutionists favor since calculating a random infinite number of proteins would result in an even larger outcome, and not in their statistical favor at all.\n They calculate the probability of sequential trials, rather than simultaneous trials.\n  this makes perfect sense and also is necessary since nature would have also worked in incremental changes since evolution didn't jump from the simple original proteins to complex biological life forms by any means. Evolution was most definitely an incremental process if real, so by what standard would you expect billions of modern calculations being performed simultaneously to be expected as if the goal of abio was to result in complex life? Remember, it is you mooks who constantly argue that more complex life has never been the goal of natural selection by way of RANDOM MUTATION. Don't you remember that you claim it is a hit or miss proposition, this evolutionary scam of yours?\n They misunderstand what is meant by a probability calculation.\n And here is that sanctimony I mentioned above. Your side can't come up with a calculation which proves how reasonable your pseudo science IS, yet here you are claiming that my side isn't smart enough to comprehend the probability calculation which they did come up with. emoticon_xgood\n They seriously underestimate the number of functional enzymes/ribozymes present in a group of random sequences.\n And you have a problem with this?

You don't have to calculate the odds of the specific proteins presently found, merely any proteins which would serve a similar function, this substantially increases the odds. For example, what are the odds of me picking the ace of spade from a deck of cards? Now, what are the odds of me picking a spade from a deck of cards?\n \n \n this makes perfect sense and also is necessary since nature would have also worked in incremental changes since evolution didn't jump from the simple original proteins to complex biological life forms by any means.

They are saying that there wasn't one interaction occuring every second/minute/hour(whatever time period you want to use), there were multiple interactions, probably numbering in the billions. A billion interactions taking place one after another takes a long time. A billion interactions taking place at once significantly shortens the time period, and increases the likelihood of a \"desired\" result-a self replicating molecule. And all it takes is one self replicating molecule.\n \n \nAnd here is that sanctimony I mentioned above.

Those who claim abiogenesis is impossible are stating \"only ribosomes x,y or z work\", because that is what is present now. The thing is, ribosomes a-z would probably work, it's just that x,y or z are the ones that were happened upon as a solution.",

ARTIFICIAL GENETIC BREEDING. It isn't evolution through natural selection by way of random mutations.

Nor will you see it. That is what macro-evolution is claiming what led to your existence, and evolution does claim it happened in reality in that before dogs were dogs, they were first reptiles which evolved from amphibians which evolved from fish and so on going back to proteins and bacteria in the primordial ooze. \n \n So the question being debated here isn't whether Man can manipulate genes in breeding certain traits into different types of animals. It's about whether macro-evolution has ever taken place as evolution claims which is how they perceive that every diverse type and variety of life on Earth today originally came from the same single celled protein which was somehow born into and survived in a molten lava environment of helium and sulfuric acid long enough to grow, replicate, and over a couple of billions more years in that environment until the earth slowly cooled, and life somehow formed into more complex organisms. \n \n Now, while keeping what I have said in mind, please read what these 3 scholars surmised as the mathematical odds of what evolution claims, actually occurring.

   "I am about to get buried in grading for the better part of two weeks or so. While I do plan to check in and see what others are saying, I won't be able to post for a bit. A temporary last hurrah of sorts.\n \n \nI answered this already. I'm not asking you to accept it as valid evidence. I'm posting it as valid evidence and asking you to refute it with actual scientific evidence that one species of animal has EVER evolved into another species of animal. In this whole diatribe you still haven't produced any real evidence of any claim you make.\n\n \n And in much of the rest of my post, my point was precisely that you won't accept any evidence that anyone offers. More in a minute.\n \n \nSo once again because yet another evo apologist can't offer evidence in order to defend what the Creation account says, he attempts to change the subject by derailing the discussion. Start another debate if you want to discuss the reason the two chapters say what they do....\n\n \n All due respect, Archie, but go back and look at the very first post on this thread. You want to accuuse me of \"derailing the discussion?\" Please.\n \n At least my comments on this score have the merit of referring to my substantive post in response to the OP.\n \n \n...but for now, just offer proof that MACRO-EVOLUTION HAS OCCURRED, IN OPPOSITION TO WHAT THIS ALLEGEDLY CONFLICTING ACCOUNT SAYS, PERIOD!!!\n\n \n There are reams of evidence out there. Book after book after book. All I could really do is recommend that you take a look at that stuff. But I'm afraid that it won't really matter, because there is simply no evidence that you would be willing to accept. Again, More in a minute.\n \n \n[Matthew:]I sometimes get the impression that the only evidence you and many other creationists would accept is thousands upon thousands of years of video, recording how species change over time. That is of course not going to happen. Ergo, evolutionists can't prove their case. QED\nAgain with ridiculous and juvenile assertions.\n\n \n Why is this ridiculous or juvenile? I cannot think of one sort of evidence you would accept. Except, perhaps, a direct observation of a member of Species X giving birth to a member of Species Y.\n \n Aside from the fact that this isn't going to happen, it displays a profound misunderstanding of what evolution says about the whole notion of species in the first place. You are asking for a sort of evidence that is neither possible nor relevant. That is my point.\n \n \nYou seem to have no problem producing reams of volumes of convoluted and contradictory conclusions which fail to hold up under the most basic scrutiny...\n\n \n Such as?... I have yet to see you show any of my views to be inconsistent, on any topic.\n \n \n...yet with the complete fossil record which you hold up as evidence that evolution is allegedly a valid science, YOU NOW ADMIT FOR ALL TO SEE THAT YOU CAN'T PROVE MACRO-EVOLUTION IS A FACT.\n\n \n No, I don't. You are reinforcing my conclusion that you simply didn't understand what I was driving at.\n \n \nFINALLY WE GET ONE HONEST ADMISSION FROM AN EVOLUTIONIST EVEN THOUGH HE WILL NOW DENY THAT'S WHAT HE MEANT TO SAY.\n\n \n True, but in my defense, I'm only denying that's what I meant to say because I didn't say it at all.\n \n You have badly misunderstood me. I'm not saying -- either intentionally or in a Freudian slip -- that \"macro-evolution\" can't be proved. I'm saying there is no proof any evolutionist could offer that you would accept.\n \n \n[Matthew:]Never you mind that this sort of \"problem\" would render history and archaeology and forensics impossible. It renders creationism impossible to verify as well. The epistemological bar has been set so high at this point that literally no account of the past could surmount it.\nBalderdash and foolish bluster. That's all you offer.\n\n \n Why is that \"balderdash and foolish bluster?\" If direct observation is an epistemological requirement for science, then no attempt to reconstruct the past could ever be scientific. This would apply to evolution, but also to archaeology, to forensics, and even to creationism itself, since no one can directly observe these purport to describe.\n \n \nYou may consider the evidentiary bar to be set too high to reach but I have no doubts or problems at all with my evidence.\n\n \n And your lack of any doubt at all is precisely why I find your entire religious view so deeply flawed. You are a finite and fallible human being. It is not possible for you to know anything -- anything -- with that kind of certainty.\n \n \nIt's a no brainer that the Genesis account is the absolute and undeniable truth which will be born out when the eternal truth is known to each of us.\n\n \n Now who's offering mere \"bluster?\" If this is what you're going to say, don't just say it and declare it a \"no-brainer,\" as if those who disagree are simply stupid. Defend your claim.\n \n You can start by explaining what you mean by \"the Genesis account.\" To which of the two are you referring?...\n \n \n[Matthew:]The Bible merely states that animals reproduce \"after their kinds.\" Which, of course, every evolutionist on earth will happily grant you.\nReally? Then you are admitting that MACRO-EVOLUTION has never occurred at all? that evolution is based on the higher forms of biological life which currently fills the earth didn't all evolve from simple celled organisms going back billions of years in earths distant past? Is that what you're admitting here Matthew, my alleged christian brother?\n\n \n No. Once again, I am trying to make plain that you do not understand how speciation works.\n \n It is very telling that you omitted what I said next. I explained there precisely how each individual organism does, in fact, reproduce \"after its kind.\" The difference in kinds does not come about from one generation to the next. It is noticeable only after the great number of intervening generations between a far-distant ancestor and the current generation are no longer with us.\n \n Someone -- I think it was Iangb, apologies if it's not -- brought up \"ring-species,\" like herring gulls or certain California salamanders. These species are interesting because they illustrate in space how the process works through time. Travelling around the ring, each population breeds with its neighbors, until you get back to the starting point, where two distinct populations exist and don't interbreed. What keeps them the \"same species\" is the gene flow around the ring. But if the ring breaks -- if a population somewhere in the middle goes extinct and the ring doesn't reconnect -- then gene flow is cut off, and the single species will diverge into two.\n \n You really need to consider how all this works. Its not balderdash or bluster, I assure you. It's population genetics.\n \n Love the \"alleged Christian brother\" remark, by the way.\n \n \n[Matthew:]Unrelated bacteria engage in \"lateral gene transfer\" between species...\nReally? Then they evolve and are no longer bacteria? Or are they another genus of bacteria!!! Which is it and support your answer with actual evidence rather than unsupported claims.\n\n \n Again, you simply don't understand the whole notion of what a species is -- or rather, you don't understand just how problematic the whole notion of \"species\" is.\n \n They are still bacteria, according to the way we use the term \"bacteria.\" But are they still the same \"species\" of bacteria? I'm far from an expert, I'll readily admit. But if they've got new genes, are they \"the same\" as they were before? Perhaps if the new genes don't make much functional difference, we wouldn't recognize them as being at all different. But if they were to make a functional difference, then we likely would. And if there are still other members of the original species around that don't even have the new genes, then we've got divergence.\n \n Can \"actual evidence\" clarify matters? I doubt it. Like I said, I'm no expert on LGT in bacteria and its implications for evolution, so I can't give you all the details. But the issue isn't the mechanisms of LGT. What's at issue is what constitutes a \"species\" in biology. And the \"actual evidence,\" far from presenting a clear answer, is what creates the problem.\n \n \n[Matthew:]and there is evidence that this may happen in eukaryotic organisms\nYou're speaking nonsense and gibberish which proves you have no idea what you are saying.\n\n \n I'm sorry, Archie, but that's simply not the case. I new quite well what I was saying. The last I had read, there was evidence of lateral gene transfer occurring between an epiphytic liverwort and Amorella trichopoda, a flowering plant believed to be the most primordial flowering plant alive today. Let's look at what \"you\" say next:\n \n \nAll living organisms are composed of cells. A eukaryotic cell is a cell with a nucleus, which contains the cell's chromosomes. Plants, animals, protists, and fungi have eukaryotic cells, unlike the Eubacteria and Archaea, whose cells do not have nuclei and are therefore termed prokaryotic. In addition to having a nucleus, eukaryotic cells differ from prokaryotic cells in being larger and much more structurally and functionally complex. Eukaryotic cells contain subcompartments called organelles, which carry out specialized reactions within their boundaries. A eukaryotic cell may be an individual organism, such as the amoeba, or a highly specialized part of a multicellular organism, such as a neuron.\n\n \n A quick Google search reveals that these are not your own words. Thanks for the citatation.\n \n In any event, these things are all true. They are also completely irrelevant to whether or not LGT can or can't occur between eukaryotes. Maybe what's going on between the liverwort and the amborella isn't LGT after all. Or maybe it is. But that will certainly not be because of anything in what you've \"quoted\" here.\n \n Based on the facts that these aren't your own words and that they aren't relevant anyway, I'd say it wasn't me who had 'no idea what he was saying.'\n \n (You once wondered when I'd invoke my God-given Christian rights to rebuke others. This is typically a bit out of character for me. I hope the above qualifies -- \"my alleged Christian brother.\")\n \n \n[Matthew:]Many plants will quite naturally hybridize with plants of other species, and the hybrids that are produced are often fertile, capable of reproducing with one or both parent species or with each other.\nWho are you trying to deceive Matt, yourself or me? Or is it the observers who read these threads?\n\n \n An interesting thing to ask, given what you did in \"your\" immediately preceding comments. But I digress. (And I shall not bring up the matter again.)\n \n \nBeside the fact that once again you have just offered cheap lip service but evidence of nothing at all. You are apparently not smart enough to appreciate that all plants are of the same KIND of organism so for rapid adaptation to occur in the wild isn't macro-evolution by any standard of the term.\n\n \n Again, this merely displays how little you understand the entire nature of the problem here. \"Kind,\" as you are using it here, is absurdly vague.\n \n Can one species of moss \"rapidly adapt\" to changed conditions in such a way that it no longer resembles its own earlier generations living in the original conditions and could no longer breed with them if they were still around?\n \n Perhaps more pertinently, can one population of a species of moss \"rapidly adapt\" to changed conditions in this way, even as another population doesn't since it's local conditions don't change, thereby yielding two \"kinds\" that can no longer interbreed, despite sharing common ancestors?\n \n If your answer to either of these is \"yes,\" then you believe in macro-evolution. You just think macro-evolution happens quickly, and thus call it \"rapid adaptation.\" And simply defining \"plant\" as the relevant \"kind\" isn't going to save you.\n \n \nShow me evidence that a plant has evolved into, let's say an insect and I'll be impressed.\n\n \n And I'd be perplexed. This isn't what evolution says happened.\n \n Flowering plants evolved from seed plants that didn't originally have flowers. Seed plants evolved from vascular plants that didn't originally have seeds. Vascular plants evolved from land plants that didn't originally have vascular systems. Land plants evolved from algae that couldn't originally survive on dry land. Algae evolved from single-celled eukaryotes that weren't originally photosynthetic.\n \n A similar ancestral chain could be put together for insects. It is only somewhere at the level of staggeringly ancient non-photosythetic single-celled eukaryotes that evolution hypothesizes a common ancestor between plants and insects. To claim otherwise indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of evolution.\n \n \nThat is what macro-evolution claims has led to the advent of the human being after all. And that is the crux of this debate.\n\n \n That's not what evolution claims at all. If you want a good look at what evolution actually says about human evolution, check out Carl Zimmers Smithsonian Intimate Guide to Human Origins.\n \n \n[Matthew:]There is even evidence that fertile hybridization occurs more frequently than previously realized in the animal kingdom, especially among invertebrates and fish.\nReally?\n\n \n Yes, there really is such evidence.\n \n \nThen what other species of animals do the invertebrates evolve into? And what other species of amphibian, reptile or land mammal have fish evolved into?\n\n \n Again, you miss the point. Nobody is claiming that contemporary fish are busy evolving into, say, amphibians -- though it would be doggone interesting to crystal-ball mudskippers and see where their descendents are 10 million years from now!\n \n Indeed, if a species or genus or family of fish does end up evolving land-dwelling descendents 10 million years from now, it is certainly not bound to be an amphibian, a reptile, a bird, or a mammal. It couldn't be, since the evolutionary lines of those other groups have already diverged from that of the fish lineage in question.\n \n You seem to think of evolution in terms of pre-given kinds into which an earlier species evolves. But this isn't how it works.\n \n And my point about hybridization is twofold. First, it shows animals not reproducing after their kinds, if by \"kinds\" one means \"species.\" Second, it enables evolution by changing the gene flow. \n \n \nAnd why are you just claiming this rather than posting the evidence which will put this debate to rest forever? Why are you expecting me to take your unsubstantiated word for this in a debate where facts are required as evidence for your claims?\n\n \n I've already brought up Zimmer, so let me mention a couple of his other books: Evolution, which is a general treatment of the subject, including its history; and At the Water's Edge, which is specifically concerned with how land animals evolved from fish, and also how whales evolved from terrestrial mammals.\n \n But of course that's just the tip of the iceberg. I will never ask you to take \"my unsubstantiated word\" for anything. I will, however, ask you to go out and do some investigating for yourself. Just be prepared for a lot of material.\n \n \nAnd yet you haven't produced one iota of evidence to support your unsubstantiated assertions here.\n\n \n See above. It is not my fault if you won't look for the evidence on your own. There is so much of it that it is beyond pointless to try to reproduce it all here. If you are so inclined, you can look.\n \n \nReal impressive brother. You're no better an advocate for your religion of evolution than you are for your religion of christianity.\n\n \n Yes, well, it remains the case that evolution is not my religion (or anybody else's for that matter).\n \n As for advocating on behalf of Christianity, I'd say that you're not exactly doing a bang-up job on these boards. Maybe it's because of how you behave toward your opponents?\n \n Imperious declarations of \"balderdash\" and \"gibberish\" rather than explaining why someone is wrong, hypocritical demands that others stick to your topic even what that topic itself has entirely derailed a thread, name-calling, questioning people's intelligence, attacking their motives, and questioning the honesty of their claims to be Christian simply because they don't believe and behave as you do -- not exactly a model worth emulating, in my estimation.\n \n (Guess I'm on roll with that whole \"rebuke\" thing!)\n \n \n[Matthew:]Evolution is not a religion. It's a natural science that seeks to understand the origins of organisms via natural processes based on empirical evidence from field and experiment. Does this have implications for religion? You bet. Does it make evolution a religion? Not at all.\n \n Meanwhile, as far as idolatry goes, I think the most common form in America is the substitution of the Bible for God.\nBalderdash! It's a philosophically based religion which requires more faith to accept than my monotheistic belief in the God of Israel.\n\n \n Sorry, but no. Like all natural sciences, it's based on drawing inferences from empirical evidence. It does this no differently than we all do in daily life.\n \n And it's not at all incompatible with monoetheistic faith. Or at least, not with all versions of it.\n \n \nAnd Darwin's book,\" On the Origin of Species\" is your bible.\n\n \n No, the Bible is my Bible. Darwin's book is about an aspect of nature, not about God or our relationship to Him.\n \n \nJust remember Matthew, you cannot serve two masters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.\n\n \n And given its complicity with greed-enabling and poor-demonizing economic policies, a better criticism of conservative Christianity could not be made!\n \n It's the grand irony: Conservative Christians frequently bash Darwinian biological ideas for their connection to Social Darwinism -- but the economic policies they advocate are merely Social Darwinism with their erroneous Biblical rationalizations substituted for the Spencer's erroneous biological ones.\n \n Mammon, indeed.\n \n -sigh-\n \n No more rebukes from me. Not really my style.",

   "What is not only very interesting, but incredible is that in this whole thread this is the only post which has even attempted to answer the OP question. Effective Arguments For Disproving Biblical Creation\n\n \n This is verifiably false. Several people tried to answer the OP, including myself.\n \n \nEverything else written has been personal attacks and non responses to the arguments I have posted.\n\n \n Which, intriguingly, had nothing to do with the OP. You tried to derail the thread, and it worked.\n \n On the other hand, I have to say that it's always good to keep up one's practice in refuting creationist arguments. So I've softened my stance a bit on your derailing.\n \n Meanwhile, although there were some personal attacks thrown your way, several people, including Iangb, Unkerpaulie, and myself have attempted to address your arguments substantively. What we have received from you is personal attacks and non responses. Rather ironic, eh?\n \n \nBut at no time has anyone offered any actual evidence to prove anything I have said wrong...\n\n \n Archie, you have said so many incorrect things about evolution on this thread that it's hard to know where to begin. The idea that 'evolution teaches essentially that a fish walked out of the ocean and survived long enough to become a mammal 'springs readily to mind.\n \n \n...or any evidence that disproves biblical creation.\n\n \n I'll speak only for myself, but in my substantive response to the OP -- which you apparently missed -- I pointed out the flatly contradictory positions of humanity in the two separate orders of creation provided in Genesis. I'd say that qualifies.\n \n You may of course reject my view if you like. And it would be great if, instead of just declaring that my view is wrong and suggesting that a real Christian could never hold it, you would point out what's actually wrong with it.\n \n \nAll of you alleged intellectual giants against this innorant christian and you can't even shut me down with any facts. If I'm innorant, then that must mean you all are stupid. And yes, I know the correct spelling is ignorant.\n\n \n Archie, again I'm not trying to be rude, but when it comes to evolution, you ARE ignorant. What you say here indicates a superficial understanding of the subject at best.\n \n Ignorance is no sin. It can be owned up to, and if one is so inclined, it can be fixed.\n \n Instead of being defensive and lashing out at everyone else for being \"stupid,\" why don't you try to turn critical eye toward yourself for a moment, and consider: Do I really understand evolution? Do I grasp how evolutionary biologists say that evolution works, or what the course of evolutionary history has been?\n \n If you get through all of that, and you still reject evolution, well, okay. I'd still disagree with you, but at least I'd think you knew what you were talking about. Right now, you give no such impression.",

Hoyle didn't understand what he was talking about in this case. There is no rule that says just because somebody understands one thing well, or even a great many things well, he must understand everything well. Hoyle is a class example.\n \n \nWhy doesn't anyone on your side show the statistical probabilities that such a miraculous event of evolution occurring as stated by your religious proponents?\n\n \n Why doesn't anyone on your side acknowledge that that sort of \"miraculous event\" isn't what evolution actually says occurs?\n \n I mean, seriously, I find it mind-blowing that this argument gets repeated so often. Evolution never claims that you go from single simple cells to billions of complex cells making up complex organisms in a single step. It never even claims that you go from a simple molecule to a molecule composed out of a few hundred simpler molecular components in a single step. These idea really are preposterous -- and since they're not what evolution says or presupposes, it is completely beside the point to demand that evolution show how they're possible!!!",

There are dozens, if not hundreds of threads much less posts that do just that. The thing is you deny everything you do not like and ignore everything you cannot deal with. Case in point, last week you argued the flood laid down sediment layers and all of the fossils despite having it earlier pointed out to you in the year that the sediment required would be almost a cubic billion miles. You ignored that again.

   "But have you ever seen man turn a LIZARD into a DOG?\n \n I think not. Nor will you see it. That is what macro-evolution is claiming what led to your existence, and evolution does claim it happened in reality in that before dogs were dogs, they were first reptiles which evolved from amphibians which evolved from fish and so on going back to proteins and bacteria in the primordial ooze.\n\n \n -sigh-\n \n Archie, I'm sorry, but this is just wrong. No evolutionist has ever claimed that lizards can turn into dogs.\n \n What is claimed is that dogs evolved from wolves. That wolves themselves evolved from other wolf-like carnivores. That wolf-carnivores evolved from other carnivores. That carnivores evolved from other placental mammals. That placental mammals evolved from earlier egg-laying mammals. And that egg-laying mammals evolved from a group of reptiles that were very similar to mammals in a number of respects (e.g. jaw and ear structure, dentition, legs and locomotion, etc.).\n \n There are also a number of ways in which these so-called \"mammal-like reptiles\" superficially bear more resemblance to modern lizards than to modern mammals. But the mammal-like reptiles are emphatically not lizards, and this is about as close as you're going to get to a lizards-to-dogs scenario.\n \n \n...every diverse type and variety of life on Earth today originally came from the same single celled protein which was somehow born into and survived in a molten lava environment of helium and sulfuric acid long enough to grow, replicate, and over a couple of billions more years in that environment until the earth slowly cooled, and life somehow formed into more complex organisms.\n\n \n Again -- huh? A couple billion years of \"a molten lava environment of helium and sulfuric acid?\" I don't think so. Where are you getting this stuff?\n \n \nAnd for Gods sake please personally educate yourself regarding this subject...\n\n \n Right back atcha!\n \n \n \n[Citation:] Nobel laureate Francis Crick[/B] calculated nature's chances of producing one small protein: 1 in 10 to the 260th power. Crick reminds us there are only 10 to the 80th power (1 followed by 80 zeros) atoms in the whole universe; he concludes even the elementary components of life \"cannot have arisen by pure chance.\"\n\n \n Indeed it cannot. And what you are ignoring is that natural selection is not pure chance.\n \n Crick himself came to realize that his earlier views of abiogenesis were wrong. Here's a link: http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/reprint/7/1/238.pdf .\n \n \n[Citation:] Sir Fred Hoyle calculated nature's chances of producing the 2000 enzymes found in life: 1 in 10 to the 40,000th power. He states: \"The Darwinian theory of evolution is shown to be plainly wrong.\" He concludes: \"Life cannot have had a random beginning(16)...but must have come from a cosmic intelligence.\"\n\n \n Hoyle's understanding of Darwinian evolution is the only thing that is \"plainly wrong.\" To reword yet repeat, natural selection is not random.\n \n \n[Citation:] Nobel laureate Ernst Chain said: \"To postulate that the development and survival of the fittest is entirely a consequence of chance mutations seems to me a hypothesis based on no evidence and irreconciliable with the facts.\"\n\n \n Chain is absolutely right: Life did not develop and diversify \"entirely [as] a consequence of chance mutations.\" He left out natural selection.\n \n It is time to retire the \"life can't have originated or diversified randomly\" non-criticism. Evolution doesn't propose that it did.\n \n To say otherwise indicates only that there is a flaw in the speaker's understanding of evolution, not that there is a flaw in the theory of evolution itself.",

It's all to be expected from this crowd. No real facts provided. Matthew just quoted statements I made and pretty much repeated the same mantra over and over as specifically as possible about how I just don't get it. \n \n But i do get it. I do understand that what you humanists cling to is a lie and a fairy tale created by men to explain the origins of life apart from an intelligent and personal Creator. I don't care how you dress your philosophy up in a package to appear to be legitimate science, because it is still a fraud and a lie. I find it especially sad that people who claim to possess the enlightenment of advanced intellect are so easily deceived into following such shallow drivel as this pseudo science represents. \n \n But I will never convince you secular humanists that you are wrong and that even though neither of us has all of the facts regarding how life came to be on Earth, that I am much closer to the actual factual truth than you are. So we are at a stalemate, if you will because nothing you say will convince me I have it wrong.\n \n What I really get a kick out of is that you, Matthew in particular in this most recent stream of criticisms critiques specific points in which he believes I am misled in my understanding of evolution when my constant complaint is that even evolution proponents don't agree with what evolution theory promotes. A perfect example/case in point is the tree of life I posted. I posted it from a pro-evolution source yet Matthew claims it is wrong. \n \n If we could get the opinions of the site contributers, they would strongly disagree with Matthew's critique of their tree of life of course, and they would tell him that he just doesn't get it as he tells me the same thing. I could probable dig up 4 or 5 Trees of Life or Timelines of evolution to post which all disagree with each other. What then do we surmise from this inconsistency? That it is just as I have been saying all along, EVEN THE GREAT PSEUDO SCIENCE OF EVOLUTION DOESN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IT BELIEVES. THAT'S WHY I SAY IT HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE. IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS VERSION OF IT, CHOOSE ANOTHER BECAUSE IT'S THERE FOR YOU. THIS IS WHY I CONSTANTLY GET CRITICIZED FOR WHAT I POST. I QUOTE FROM ONE PRO EVOLUTION SITE AND SOME EVOLUTIONIST STILL SAYS IT'S ME WHOSE WRONG. \n \n In closing, after going to the Apple Store for some shopping today and having an early dinner, we went to see Inglorious Bastards. It was an excellent film even though Tarantino is far from my favorite director. In spite of that, the film flowed, the plot snapped and the action and acting was fast paced and tight.

Instead, despite having accused others of being non-responsive to your posts, you now state (in the post prior to that quoted here) that you simply \"don't care\" what they will say to you.\n\n \n It's interesting to me how you all just parrot me in claiming now that it is I who offers nothing substantive when that has been my repeated complaint about your side considering this thread has gone around 250 posts by now and I have stood against a number of you alone. There should be volumes of evidence from your side by now, but there isn't. You have offered little more than unsubstantiated claims and opinions as you repeatedly insist that you are right and that I don't get it. But as for you actually producing \"real\" and \"verifiable evidence\"? You haven't because there is none. real and verifiable being the key words of course. THREE words which are anathema to you. \n \n And as for my declaring that nothing your side says convincing me of anything, I also made clear that the same problem applies to your side accepting my side of the debate, which is why we are at a stalemate. Do you find me admitting that we are at a philosophical stalemate to be disingenuous, or a completely honest assessment of our respective positions? \n \n \nBased on what I see on these boards, if the choice is between you and Russell, I'd choose Russell every day of the week -- and twice on Sunday. For in terms of intellectual honesty and respect for other people, he strikes me as the better Christian.\n\n \n Well of course you would prefer an atheist like Russell over me, Matthew. You have shown in every post you have ever written here that you identify with atheists and committed non and anti-christians more than you do believers like me. That's why the crux of so many of our debates refer back to your hypocritical yet oft repeated claims that you are a believer as you defend the atheist side of every issue we debate around here. \n \n And you prove yourself to be as disingenuous as your secular humanist and atheist cohorts as you accuse me of being intellectually dishonest when I am completely consistent and committed to my belief system, and never capitulate or compromise my personal convictions for the sake of being accepted by those I find to be wrong, lying, deceived or just plain hypocrites as they claim to believe one thing while they represent a completely diametrically opposing philosophy; you know, like you do!!! I must question if you even understand what intellectual dishonesty means if you will apply it to me while not seeing that you define it to the T.\n \n \nGuess I had another rebuke in me after all!\n\n \n This wasn't a rebuke, it was an attempt at justifying the lies you defend and represent so faithfully at my expense. As you can see though, the truth and reason wins out every time and your hypocrisy and erroneous opinion is easily exposed for exactly what it is. \n \n \n \nWOW, as I have been out and about today you mental midgets have been here writing a total of 17 posts since my last one, and every one of them just claiming how wrong I am and how I don't understand evolution, in addition to the insults and snipes in the mix. It's all to be expected from this crowd. No real facts provided. Matthew just quoted statements I made and pretty much repeated the same mantra over and over as specifically as possible about how I just don't get it. \n \n But i do get it. I do understand that what you humanists cling to is a lie and a fairy tale created by men to explain the origins of life apart from an intelligent and personal Creator. I don't care how you dress your philosophy up in a package to appear to be legitimate science, because it is still a fraud and a lie. I find it especially sad that people who claim to possess the enlightenment of advanced intellect are so easily deceived into following such shallow drivel as this pseudo science represents. \n \n But I will never convince you secular humanists that you are wrong and that even though neither of us has all of the facts regarding how life came to be on Earth, that I am much closer to the actual factual truth than you are. So we are at a stalemate, if you will because nothing you say will convince me I have it wrong.\n \n What I really get a kick out of is that you, Matthew in particular in this most recent stream of criticisms critiques specific points in which he believes I am misled in my understanding of evolution when my constant complaint is that even evolution proponents don't agree with what evolution theory promotes. A perfect example/case in point is the tree of life I posted. I posted it from a pro-evolution source yet Matthew claims it is wrong. \n \n If we could get the opinions of the site contributers, they would strongly disagree with Matthew's critique of their tree of life of course, and they would tell him that he just doesn't get it as he tells me the same thing. I could probable dig up 4 or 5 Trees of Life or Timelines of evolution to post which all disagree with each other. What then do we surmise from this inconsistency? That it is just as I have been saying all along, EVEN THE GREAT PSEUDO SCIENCE OF EVOLUTION DOESN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IT BELIEVES. THAT'S WHY I SAY IT HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE. IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS VERSION OF IT, CHOOSE ANOTHER BECAUSE IT'S THERE FOR YOU. THIS IS WHY I CONSTANTLY GET CRITICIZED FOR WHAT I POST. I QUOTE FROM ONE PRO EVOLUTION SITE AND SOME EVOLUTIONIST STILL SAYS IT'S ME WHOSE WRONG. \n \n In closing, after going to the Apple Store for some shopping today and having an early dinner, we went to see Inglorious Bastards. It was an excellent film even though Tarantino is far from my favorite director. In spite of that, the film flowed, the plot snapped and the action and acting was fast paced and tight. Not to mention the story line had twists which he captured and followed through with beautifully. I give it a strong emoticon_xgood\n",

   "I came back to the thread all ready to go into specifics on the maths of the tornado in a junkyard. Instead, I've come back to find that Archangel has completely ignored my posts - even going so far as to repeat the same misunderstandings about macroevolution several further times. He has done equally to Matthew. As such, I see no point in doing the maths on something which he is either going to completely ignore, or going to dismiss because 'I set out to disprove Hoyles theory' or somesuch.\n \n So, Archie, two brief bits of commentary is all you're getting until you can prove that you will actually take what other people have written into consideration, rather than dismissing their responses for arbitrary reasons, attributing to them false characteristics or simply ignoring what they've posted.\n \n Firstly, your 'summary argument' of #242. After repeatedly asking for sources, citations and 'proof', this post contains not a one. It also reads far to much into non-scientific diagrams.\n The post also states your basic agenda - to quote, \"I don't care how you dress your philosophy up in a package to appear to be legitimate science, because it is still a fraud and a lie\". In short, you here state unequivocally that what ever we say, you will consider evolution to be wrong.\n \n Secondly, a snippet from a later post:\n \nYou see no evidence of Christly love in my continuously telling you the hard spiritual truths which lead to salvation?\nI thought that you told us that 'evolution is NOT A SALVATION ISSUE'?

Period.\n\n \n Evolution does IN FACT say that these stages of evolution did occur in that all life on land eventually evolved from creatures which came from the Sea. And those seas creatures evolved from proteins and microbes which were allegedly formed in the primordial ooze by way of some spontaneous form of random mutation. \n \n And for you to all of a sudden become a literalist when you are a generalist in every other aspect of the debate is just more evidence of your dishonesty regarding this sketchy issue.\n \n \nSo what are you going to do about that?

The question I have is how can you claim to believe in that Creator God as you deny and reject HIS explanation for how you came to be here? He says you were planned while you say you were a random accident of nature.\n \n \nNo, there's plenty of evidence. But \"there is none\" that you will accept.\n\n \n Wrong again, THERE IS NO ABSOLUTELY RELIABLE EVIDENCE, SO THERE IS NOTHING WORTHY OF ACCEPTING.\n \n \nThe issue of what constitutes acceptable evidence was another substantive matter discussed in my posts.

How many times will the guy who can't even supply absolute evidence for what he claims is a valid and authoritative science, continue to tell me that it is I who doesn't understand it? How about we start with the fact that the real problem is that I am dealing with people who refuse to accept that their whole evolutionist belief system is based on an unprovable, unrepeatable and unverifiable house of cards which is NOT based in any factual data at all! How about you admit that you are too blind to recognize how weak and impossible what you claim to be reality is in reality?\n \n \nI have no doubt that you believe what you say you believe. I have never criticized you for a lack of commitment.\n\n \n Sure you did. You said I was intellectually dishonest which implies I don't really believe the things I say here in defense of the positions I defend. When the fact is that you are the intellectually dishonest one, and that is undeniable since you claim to be a christian believer and follower of Christ as you defend an undeniably secular humanist gospel which attempts to explain how man came to be without any active or personal participation from the Judeo Christian Creator God spoken of in the bible you CLAIM to accept. \n \n You are the only intellectually dishonest one between us Matthew, and sadly, you are too blind to recognize it in yourself.\n \n \nThe problem is, right now, any time something challenges your worldview, you attack the character of him who offered the challenge. And the above is a case in point.\n\n \n I'm not attacking you Matthew. I am pointing out the obvious hypocrisy which you represent here as you claim to be one thing and defend another. Remember what Matthew 6:24 says Matt, No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. It's speaking directly to you. :xbanghead emoticon_xangel\n \n And one more thing Matt. It took me a while to get back to you because unlike you, I went to church today to fellowship with like minded believers and to worship my heavenly Father. I realize that wasn't an issue for you based on the time your post was submitted. emoticon_xdonno Like I said though, as hypocrites go, at least you're consistent. emoticon_xgood",

Just like the last time I tried to engage you.\n\n \n As long as you claim to be a believer and follower of Christ, yet spend your time defending the exact opposite of what His word teaches, I am going to call you the obvious hypocrite that you are. \n \n If you come here and admit that you're an atheist or at least a dedicated secular humanist who rejects the judeo-christian teachings in the Old and New Testaments my respect for you will rise considerably since you will be debating from an honest position.\n \n But as long as you spew the same old Secular humanist party line which is in perfect harmony with the atheist perspective, as you dishonestly claim to be a christian believer, then I am going to continue to prove you're a liar and a hypocrite. \n \n \nArchie, anyone who believes that evolution says a fish turned into a mammal, a lizard could turn into a dog, or a plant could turn into an insect does not understand evolution. Period.\n\n \n Evolution does IN FACT say that these stages of evolution did occur in that all life on land eventually evolved from creatures which came from the Sea. And those seas creatures evolved from proteins and microbes which were allegedly formed in the primordial ooze by way of some spontaneous form of random mutation. \n \n And for you to all of a sudden become a literalist when you are a generalist in every other aspect of the debate is just more evidence of your dishonesty regarding this sketchy issue.\n \n \nSo what are you going to do about that? Just assert \"I do get it\" again?\n\n \n I've explained it twice now, the question is, will you admit your dishonesty in attempting to interpret my statement as you have.\n \n \nGet over the defensiveness and educate yourself about the thing you are criticizing!\n\n \n I would say the same thing to you if I thought it would make a difference, but you seem totally sold out to this man made lie and fairy tale which seeks to explain our creation apart from a personal and intelligent God. The question I have is how can you claim to believe in that Creator God as you deny and reject HIS explanation for how you came to be here? He says you were planned while you say you were a random accident of nature.\n \n \nNo, there's plenty of evidence. But \"there is none\" that you will accept.\n\n \n Wrong again, THERE IS NO ABSOLUTELY RELIABLE EVIDENCE, SO THERE IS NOTHING WORTHY OF ACCEPTING.\n \n \nThe issue of what constitutes acceptable evidence was another substantive matter discussed in my posts. And you have ignored it.\n\n \n You mean you spent a lot of time giving your useless and prejudicial opinion which is anything but informed, reliable or objective. Big deal; your opinion and a dollar and I still can't buy a lousy coffee.\n \n \nI find that there is indeed a stalemate. But it results from the fact that one side simply does not understand evolution, yet criticizes evolution as if it did. How can we even have a serious debate, when there are such serious misunderstandings of the very issue to be debated? when any attempt to correct misunderstandings is treated as evidence of the sinful character of those attempting to do the correcting?\n\n \n Blah blah blah... How many times will the guy who can't even supply absolute evidence for what he claims is a valid and authoritative science, continue to tell me that it is I who doesn't understand it? How about we start with the fact that the real problem is that I am dealing with people who refuse to accept that their whole evolutionist belief system is based on an unprovable, unrepeatable and unverifiable house of cards which is NOT based in any factual data at all! How about you admit that you are too blind to recognize how weak and impossible what you claim to be reality is in reality?\n \n \nI have no doubt that you believe what you say you believe. I have never criticized you for a lack of commitment.\n\n \n Sure you did. You said I was intellectually dishonest which implies I don't really believe the things I say here in defense of the positions I defend. When the fact is that you are the intellectually dishonest one, and that is undeniable since you claim to be a christian believer and follower of Christ as you defend an undeniably secular humanist gospel which attempts to explain how man came to be without any active or personal participation from the Judeo Christian Creator God spoken of in the bible you CLAIM to accept. \n \n You are the only intellectually dishonest one between us Matthew, and sadly, you are too blind to recognize it in yourself.\n \n \nThe problem is, right now, any time something challenges your worldview, you attack the character of him who offered the challenge. And the above is a case in point.\n\n \n I'm not attacking you Matthew. I am pointing out the obvious hypocrisy which you represent here as you claim to be one thing and defend another. Remember what Matthew 6:24 says Matt, No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. It's speaking directly to you. :xbanghead emoticon_xangel\n \n And one more thing Matt. It took me a while to get back to you because unlike you, I went to church today to fellowship with like minded believers and to worship my heavenly Father. I realize that wasn't an issue for you based on the time your post was submitted. emoticon_xdonno Like I said though, as hypocrites go, at least you're consistent. emoticon_xgood",

And you know this how? I mean, by what standard of supernatural insight do you claim to get into the heart and mind of other people obnoxious child, as you claim to speak of our fears and apprehensions in life?\n\n \n Because that place won't allow your tantrums. They force you to actually debate with evidence. You cannot do that.

   "Setting personal beliefs regarding biological evolution aside, is there even a SINGLE reader of these forums who wouldn't agree that Matthew's discourse is more clear, courteous and rational than Archangel's?\n \n Can we do a simple poll?\n\n \n Hey tester, why would we expect you, accipiter or any of your cohorts to objectively judge the value of my discourse with Matthew? It isn't as though you would ever agree with me on any issue under any circumstances. So just stick to answering to my response to the drivel you posted a couple of days ago, why don't you. And will the general public please note how none of these replies are on the topic of the debate at hand, but are just mindless attacks and obfuscations against the one person who is challenging their secular religion? Nuff said...\n \n \nFolks often refer to you TalkOrigins.org because you consistently bring up arguments which have been fully dealt with for DECADES. There's little a poster here can add to rebuttals that have been written and revised by experts specifically so laymen can understand them.\n \n For a very concise rebuttal, please at least read the Wikipedia entry on Hoyle's Fallacy.\n \n Given the complete rejection of such nonsense by all of mainstream science, I think the onus is on you to bring up something new, rather than complain when people get tired of repeating standard answers to your silly criticisms.\n\n \n What an interesting critique of Hoyles results. Unfortunately for you, they are sadly lacking specificity in stating what alleged flaws he commits in his statistical paradigm. Here is what your link says.\n \n \nAccording to Ian Musgrave in Lies, Damned Lies, Statistics, and Probability of Abiogenesis Calculations:\n \n These people, including Fred, have committed one or more of the following errors.\n They calculate the probability of the formation of a \"modern\" protein, or even a complete bacterium with all \"modern\" proteins, by random events. This is not the abiogenesis theory at all.\n \n They assume that there is a fixed number of proteins, with fixed sequences for each protein, that are required for life.\n \n They calculate the probability of sequential trials, rather than simultaneous trials.\n \n They misunderstand what is meant by a probability calculation.\n \n They seriously underestimate the number of functional enzymes/ribozymes present in a group of random sequences.\n\n \n Your link also says this.\n \n \nHoyle's fallacy is rejected by all evolutionary biologists.\n\n \n Well no kidding that evolutionary biologists would reject a statistical calculation which completely invalidates their lifes work as impossible to have occurred. \n \n And in looking at the 5 points made above which are meant to nullify the value of Hoyles calculations we see more sanctimonious condescension by those who played no part in actually running the equations yet feel qualified to critique them based on more unsupported conclusions which are not proven to be true anywhere at all. Let's go through each critique point by point and consider its relevance. \n They calculate the probability of the formation of a \"modern\" protein, or even a complete bacterium with all \"modern\" proteins, by random events. This is not the abiogenesis theory at all.\n Actually it is. The end result of what abiogenesis claims is that from the basic original building blocks which came to exist in the primordial ooze through which all life on earth grew, to what is all modern proteins and complicated bacterium, allegedly resulted from those humble beginnings. So the calculation must include the journey from that beginning to the present result.\n They assume that there is a fixed number of proteins, with fixed sequences for each protein, that are required for life.\n I can't speak to the accuracy of this claim, but if it's correct, it works in the evolutionists favor since calculating a random infinite number of proteins would result in an even larger outcome, and not in their statistical favor at all.\n They calculate the probability of sequential trials, rather than simultaneous trials.\n  this makes perfect sense and also is necessary since nature would have also worked in incremental changes since evolution didn't jump from the simple original proteins to complex biological life forms by any means. Evolution was most definitely an incremental process if real, so by what standard would you expect billions of modern calculations being performed simultaneously to be expected as if the goal of abio was to result in complex life? Remember, it is you mooks who constantly argue that more complex life has never been the goal of natural selection by way of RANDOM MUTATION. Don't you remember that you claim it is a hit or miss proposition, this evolutionary scam of yours?\n They misunderstand what is meant by a probability calculation.\n And here is that sanctimony I mentioned above. Your side can't come up with a calculation which proves how reasonable your pseudo science IS, yet here you are claiming that my side isn't smart enough to comprehend the probability calculation which they did come up with. emoticon_xgood\n They seriously underestimate the number of functional enzymes/ribozymes present in a group of random sequences.\n And you have a problem with this? Doesn't this mean, IF TRUE, that their calculated results work more in your favor rather than against it? If they worked with a larger number of functional enzymes/ribozymes present in a group of random sequences, the massive result they came up with would have been even larger, if the proposed claim is true that is.",

By that I mean spiritually blind and dead to a greater truth. I know that statement offends you, but it's the absolute truth. Sadly a truth you are completely blind to.\n \n You also have real problems understanding plain english too. And that is most frustrating for me in attempting to reason with you and your cohorts.

Why haven't you criticized him for that tester? I am neither of those things as I stand ready to consistently defend my beliefs without compromise in every debate I participate in.

I'm the philosophical enemy whom you can't defeat in honest debate, nor can you answer the questions regarding the inconsistencies in your religion of evo, so you just come here like some condescending boor and declare me ignorant to the max. \n \n WOW, what an impressive and convincing debating style you have.

If not, read further in the thread and you'll see more.\n\n \n Hi, Marc. Glad to see you again.\n \n I have to say, though, that I'm a little put off by this. In post 241, I didn't say that I found Archie stupid.\n \n Believe me when I say that I don't mean this at all facetiously, but I have given a great deal of thought over the last few years to the differences between unintelligence, ignorance, and stupidity, and how we use these terms. I have yet to call Archie either stupid or unintelligent. I do think that, based on what I see here, he is ignorant of evolutionary biology -- or perhaps, given some of the things he said earlier today, just extraordinarily careless about how he chooses to describe it.\n \n And the reference to Russell, well, that was a general observation, albeit one that the current exchange brought to mind. I suppose I could point out for clarity's sake that ignorance is no sin -- but being cocksure when you're ignorant, well....\n \n \nBeing civil to one poster that's in a gang with several trolls simply does not come natural, especially if that poster doesn't separate himself from the trolls insults. Matthew seldom if ever makes any attempt to do that.\n\n \n So Archie's attacks on me are my fault?\n \n Come on, Marc. I have never called Archie stupid. I have never questioned his Christianity -- though in reaction to his recent treatment of me, I have let him know that I don't find his behavior very Christian.\n \n I have tried my level best to treat him respectfully. I have tried to direct my criticisms at what he says and explain why I think what he says is wrong, not attack him.\n \n But what I get is constant accusations that I don't really believe in God. That I don't care about what the Bible says. That, ultimately, I am not a Christian. Heck, today, he hit a new low: He accused me, on the basis of God only knows what mode of remote cognition, of not going to church this morning. !!!\n \n I am, quite frankly, tired of it.\n \n \nStrange how todays university think tanks don't seem to classify lopsided gang debate as a \"logical fallacy\".\n\n \n Not true! I teach about \"appeal to popularity\" and \"appeal to force\" all the time.\n \n But there's a difference between appealing to populartiy and reasonably arguing in favor of a popular position.\n \n \nProbably because liberalism and atheism need it to bully conservatives and Christians out of debating.\n\n \n You mean like all those conservatives encouraging civil discourse at the town hall meetings?

   "I look forward to all your posts arch, they are hilarious!\n\n Please educate me accipiter, since you obviously can't answer the questions I asked in my post, so you're reverting to your tried and true practice of mockery. But tell me this my trolling friend, what is it you find hilarious about the questions I ask in my post to trebor? Care to offer a serious and well considered answer for once or must I nickname you penfold lyte? emoticon_xgood\n \nYou mean anytime you popped in on debate and attacked me, I gave back as good as I got. You act like I lie in wait to attack every poster that dares to approach me with a compliment or supports me in a debate. And sorry, but there are too many members here who know differently where Archangel is concerned. Like 33 friends I have for one thing; friends I never attack and who never attack me in debate. 4Forums.com Political Debates and Polls - View Profile: Archangel\n \n But you know what else is true about my friends? You can poll all of them individually and you will find that I have never used our friendship to ask them via PM to aid me in attacking or ganging up on any other poster or posters in any debates I have ever been involved in. Can you make the same claims about your little clique of rabid secular humanists? I think not.\n \n So let us be clear here that we are speaking about a small and rabid group of haters of anything right and good which position I represent and defend to the hilt here. So thank you for placing me on ignore, you are just one less that I need to deal with on a regular basis. emoticon_xgood \n \n And no answer on the question I posed to tester, Matthew, the obvious child and TQ I see. Here it is again, and if you can't answer it, and you can't, then at least show me the fallacy of asking the proponents of biological evolution to support their conclusions by producing the known and allegedly proven foundational ingredients and processes upon which it is based. And I promise that if you just answer the question posed without attacking me and insulting my intelligence for daring to ask questions your side can't answer, that I wont insult you or be mean at all. I will respond with kid gloves, if you will. just remember trebor, turn around is fair play on a debate forum.\n Archangel to tester: \n If you believe my posts on evolution are egregiously ignorant, then we have something else in common because that is precisely what I think of your pro evolution beliefs. For the life of me I can't comprehend how allegedly intelligent and educated people can swallow the evo drivel which you people do, hook line and sinker. \n \n I marvel at the incomprehensibility of it all. You have been deceived. You are believing a lie. You are adopting a false philosophy being sold as a science when it isn't even a valid or legitimate science. And what is worse you are attempting to defend something that you yourselves can't even find the absolutely undeniable evidence for, which proves that what YOU believe is an actual factual reality. How do you convince yourselves that a so called science is true, when you can't even prove it in absolute terms? \n \n Would you accept the science/mechanics that the internal combustion engine was real and valid if nobody ever actually got even one engine to run? I think not. You would say it's interesting in theory but the science doesn't work. And that would be a valid conclusion. But not with evolution. You will readily accept claims made about events which allegedly occurred starting @ 4.5 billion years ago. Events which can't be proven to have occurred at all, so they can't be repeated in a lab because the details of what allegedly occurred are unknown at every level of understanding.\n \n Can you tell me precisely what the temperature was back then? Precisely what chemicals made up the atmosphere, if any existed at all? Can you tell me the make up of the primordial ooze which your fairy tale asserts the first proteins or enzymes spontaneously appeared in? Or the temperature or chemical make up of the lava oceans which existed back then, from which the primordial ooze was synthesized over the first couple of billion years? \n \n And if I'm so egregiously ignorant tester, then how come I know enough to ask these questions of a subject I'm too ignorant to understand, which you giants of intellect have no hope of answering in another billion years? And if you don't know the answers to those initial, most basic questions regarding our origins of life on this planet according to your religions philosophy, then how egregiously ignorant is it of you to presume that the rest of the theory is at all rational? \n \n Now come back and tell me that I just don't get it tester. Tell me how ignorant I am as none of you can answer these questions from one source which will give absolute and verifiable evidence regarding the questions I have asked above. Now please forgive my ignorance. I hope I didn't embarrass myself again. Oh, and by the way; I know I wont get an answer from you since you can't answer my questions. But I'm the ignorant one for asking them, right? And your side will once again come back and explain why Archangel is the dumb one around here to reject what any intelligent adult can plainly see is a fairy tale and a lie.\n",

Does any company produce any product based on the required science before they understand the core values of that science and prove that it results in a reliable product? Of course not.\n \n Yet here you are attempting to get me to accept this so called science when you have so much as admitted that nothing which evolution is based upon is provable at all.

   "...it is built upon a foundation of unproven and unverifiable assumptions.\n\n \n Could you provide a list of those \"assumptions,\" and explain why they neither are nor can be proved?\n \n Because as far as I see it, the fundamental assumptions of evolutionary biology are no different than those of any other science.

They do not need to understand it \"absolutely.\"\n \n \nTell me how any of these scientific practices have ever or can ever be practiced with evolution when it is impossible to even test how life spontaneously began since we can't even determine which chemical processes existed under which, if any conditions existed at that time more than this alleged 4 billion years ago which also can't be verified or confirmed for certain.\n\n \n Again, what do you mean by \"for certain?\" If what you are after is a conclusion that \"absolutely\" cannot, under any circumstances, ever be overturned, then that is something that the natural sciences cannot give you, nor do they claim to. Such is the nature of the inductive reasoning upon which they are based. It's always possible for new evidence to overturn an old idea. It's always possible for a new idea to explain more than an old idea.\n \n As I said, I think you've set the bar too high.

   "Thanks for sharing your perspective, marc9000. I think you make some valid points, and I've benefitted from reading your point of view. \n\n \n Thanks. \n \n \nAt the same time, however, my take is that Archangel consistently demonstrates such profound ignorance about science, coupled with bold arrogance, that I'm not surprised to see so many (myself included) exhibit exasperation. In my opinion, Archangel is in the minority in this thread for good reason: because he is ignorant and anti-rational. \n\n \n That's your opinion and that's fine. I don't completely agree because this is far from the only thread he (or I) have been in the minority in. We're in the minority because we're creationists. That he or I are ignorant about science may say more about your definition of science than it does about our ignorance. Who is really authorized to say where the line is drawn between science and philosophy? \n \n \nWhereas I'm typically sympathetic to the plight of those in the minority, precisely for the reasons you've described, I don't think individuals, such as Matthew, should remove themselves from the discussion just because they are in the majority. Rather than adding one more frustrated voice to the \"gang\" opposing Archangel, I think he has set a new standard on these forums. I sincerely believe I would feel the same way were he to argue a point with which I disagreed. (For example, I am indeed an atheist, yet I have no doubt that I would enjoy, and benefit from, reading his motives for being Christian.) \n\n \n I don't know about setting a new standard (4forums has had lots of good posters - so many of them have disappeared) but I agree with you completely that he's a good poster. But not only in post 241, but in 250 and 253 also, he cozys up to posters that are here to do nothing but initiate flame wars. IMHO he would have better credibility if he didn't do that. The words he posts are by far good enough. Don't you think it's possible that attempts to harmonize with other posters could be a sign of weakness? \n \n \nEssentially, I don't understand your ultimate point: you seem to be saying that Archangel's discourse is superior to Matthew's because Matthew is part of the majority, rather than the value of his actual writing. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n \n I'm really saying their discourse is/could be equal, depending on the point of view of the reader. Matthew's (somewhat emotional) harmonizing with others gives lots of advantages. Another example - if Matthew quits posting, and Archangel keeps going at it with 5 or 6 others, no one declares that Matthew has \"lost\". Yet if Archangel quits posting, 6 or 7 posters then agree that he has \"lost\" that he couldn't refute their arguments. \n \n These are free-for-all forums and I'm not saying anything should be done about it, but it's something that I think needs to be pointed out from time to time.",

This article lists - and cites - some of the many further uses of genetic algorithms. \n More directly and biologically, the medical profession have to deal with drug-resistant or antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, which have evolved to become immune to current medicines.\n \n All of these meet the basic tenant of evolution - that random variation followed by selection results in improvement. \n \n There are even more basic examples - the that we share a common ancestor is the reason that drugs can be tested on animals, and our understanding of hereditary effects allows us to make transplants that are less likely to be rejected.\n \n That evolution has many applications is a proven fact.

   "Hi, Marc. Glad to see you again.\n \n I have to say, though, that I'm a little put off by this. In post 241, I didn't say that I found Archie stupid.\n \n Believe me when I say that I don't mean this at all facetiously, but I have given a great deal of thought over the last few years to the differences between unintelligence, ignorance, and stupidity, and how we use these terms. I have yet to call Archie either stupid or unintelligent. I do think that, based on what I see here, he is ignorant of evolutionary biology -- or perhaps, given some of the things he said earlier today, just extraordinarily careless about how he chooses to describe it. \n\n \n I hope I've addressed most, or all of your questions in the above posts tonight. The \"theistic evolution\" vs. \"creationist\" positions are worlds apart, no question about that. \n \n \nSo Archie's attacks on me are my fault?\n \n Come on, Marc. I have never called Archie stupid. \n\n \n You don't separate yourself from those who do, who have been doing it for years. It may not seem like a big deal to you, but you'd have to be on the receiving end of it to know what it's like. Not just once or twice, but for years. \n \n \nI have never questioned his Christianity -- though in reaction to his recent treatment of me, I have let him know that I don't find his behavior very Christian. \n\n \n That's what so many atheists say - Christians are supposed to be just warm and fuzzy and QUIET as evolutionists tell them what's actually going on. Christianity is more than that. \n \n \nI have tried my level best to treat him respectfully. I have tried to direct my criticisms at what he says and explain why I think what he says is wrong, not attack him.\n \n But what I get is constant accusations that I don't really believe in God. That I don't care about what the Bible says. That, ultimately, I am not a Christian. Heck, today, he hit a new low: He accused me, on the basis of God only knows what mode of remote cognition, of not going to church this morning. !!!\n \n I am, quite frankly, tired of it. \n\n \n I'm not his spokeman or apologist, as I said above, I'm just pointing out a few things that so many seem to forget. \n \n \nNot true! I teach about \"appeal to popularity\" and \"appeal to force\" all the time.\n \n But there's a difference between appealing to populartiy and reasonably arguing in favor of a popular position. \n\n \n I agree, but the lopsidedness of some of this can cloud things. \n \n I glanced through the \"Biblical Contradictions\" forum here and didn't see (in the titles) anything about the Genesis 1 & 2 contradiction. (there isn't one, by the way :)) I'd like to expore that with you there sometime soon. No more time tonight. \n \n \nYou mean like all those conservatives encouraging civil discourse at the town hall meetings? Yeah, they'd never dream about drowning out liberals' comments under an avalanche of boos....\n\n \n Those aren't exactly voluntary discussions, of two worldviews seeking the truth. :) They're more like two big money interests seeking victory/power.",

   "We're in the minority because we're creationists.\n\n \n No doubt. But this way of putting it makes it sound like it's about you, at a personal level, when in fact it's about creationism itself, at the level of what it says.\n \n \nWho is really authorized to say where the line is drawn between science and philosophy?\n\n \n It's very much a matter of debate within the philsophy of science itself. Has been for decades. And I don't know that the dividing line can be made as sharp as many of us on each side of the debate sometimes state or imply.\n \n But of course, if the point is to criticize someone's distinction, then \"who's to say\" criticisms could go either way. Right?\n \n \nBut not only in post 241, but in 250 and 253 also, he cozys up to posters that are here to do nothing but initiate flame wars. IMHO he would have better credibility if he didn't do that.\n\n \n What can I tell you? I try to engage people, even when I don't necessarily agree with their conduct all the time.\n \n \nThe words he posts are by far good enough. Don't you think it's possible that attempts to harmonize with other posters could be a sign of weakness?\n\n \n Should we construe your attempts to harmonize with other posters that way?\n \n Come now. Most of the reasoning you're dancing through here is thoroughly ad hominem. It's not rude, and far from insulting or offensive. But it's directed at me, not at what I say, which is ad hominem.\n \n If, as you say, \"the words I post are by far good enough,\" then why not address those instead of indulge in psychological speculations about me?\n \n \nI'm really saying their discourse is/could be equal, depending on the point of view of the reader. Matthew's (somewhat emotional) harmonizing with others gives lots of advantages.\n\n \n But not to my arguments. What I say stands or falls on its own merits. Whomever I happen to agree or disagree with, or whatever emotions I may or may not motivate me, are completely irrelevant.\n \n Either my case is a good one, or it isn't.

Though it should also be noted that sometimes, we're just sitting at opposite ends of the pew....\n \n \nYou don't separate yourself from those who do, who have been doing it for years.\n\n \n I'm not sure what the point of this criticism should be. You don't separate yourself from Archie, despite that so many of us here consider his behavior frequently rude. Should we judge you based on your association with him? Or should we perhaps deal with you as an individual?\n \n \nIt may not seem like a big deal to you, but you'd have to be on the receiving end of it to know what it's like. Not just once or twice, but for years.\n\n \n I have been on the receiving end for years. Not at present, thank heavens. But I dealt with exactly this sort of thing within the church, primarily during my twenties. And my father, who is a minister, often had it worse.\n \n But of course, my large point is: none of this matters! What I believe, what my dad believes, what you believe, what Archie believes -- none of it is either true or false just because any of us objectively is or subjectively feels persecuted by the powers that be.\n \n \nThat's what so many atheists say - Christians are supposed to be just warm and fuzzy and QUIET as evolutionists tell them what's actually going on.

   "So Archie's attacks on me are my fault?\n\n \n I just need to break in here and respond to this oft repeated claim by Matthew by setting the record straight, since we are off the topic of proving evolution and on to discussing Archangel. My repeated calling you out on your defense of the lie which evolution is as you oppose what your alleged God states actually happened in Genesis IS NOT A PERSONAL ATTACK ON YOU. IT IS A STATEMENT OF FACT REGARDING THE HYPOCRISY AND THE DOUBLE STANDARDS YOU REPRESENT IN EVERY DEBATE IN WHICH YOU OPPOSE PRECISELY THE SOURCE BOOK WHICH YOU OTHERWISE CLAIM TO BELIEVE IS TRUE. You can't have it both ways Matt. You either love the Lord or you hate Him, there is no middle ground. And that isn't my opinion, Jesus said it Himself. \n \n Mat 6:24 \"No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Mammon.\n \n Jhn 14:23 Jesus answered and said to him, \"If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him.\n Jhn 14:24 He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine but the Father's who sent Me. \n So please stop accusing me of attacking you when all I am doing is telling you the truth regarding the hypocrisy you represent here. Stop defending evolution in the name of Jesus as you continue to insist that you're a believer in Christ and I will stop calling you on the hypocrisy which you represent as you oppose the very spiritual truths you otherwise claim to believe in. Simply put, you don't represent Him well at all when you defend a lie in His name. I just don't know how many different ways to put it so you will get my point, but that's as clear as I can make it. \n \n Do you get it Matthew? Every time you argue in favor of evolution against the Genesis account you are calling the God you claim to believe in, a liar. Stop that and I will debate evolution with you as a creationist against an evolutionist all day long without calling you a hypocrite..",

It makes citing the post more enjoyable. \n \n \nThese are mainly worldview debates, not clear-cut matters of 5+5=10. Science is not the only source of knowledge.\n\n \n O'rly? Explain to me how Archie's argument which relies upon a magical near billion cubic miles of sediment makes any sense. Furthermore, explain to me how it is valid because lots of people reject it. \n \n You tried this before and failed.

What kind of bat**** argument is that? \n \n \nSo you never insult? You're really good a accusing people of doing things that you do.\n\n \n Not in the way that Archie does on a regular basis here. I've never, ever threatened anyone with eternal damnation as a method of argumentation. The only time I do so is utilizing another religion's beliefs as a way to show that no one has the answers, and thus it is foolish to have such absolutist ideas. If you cannot prove they are wrong, how do you expect to prove your own? And since you can't prove your own, how can you rationally make absolutist statements? I've never called people spiritually dead. I've never done all of that XXXX he does. \n \n Relying on threats is a sign of how weak one's argument is. \n \n The difference between you and Archie is that you are actual able to understand things you initially reject.

   "Not knowing the answers to the questions you've asked does NOT mean that inductive reasoning cannot be used to established the fact that biological evolution has (and continues to) occur. That you don't understand this only further demonstrates how ignorant you are. Seriously!\n \n I've seen numerous posters try unsuccessfully to reach by analogy, but here goes:\n \n Prior to the 1950's, do you think there was enough scientific evidence to demonstrate Earth's annual revolution about Sun? \n \n Please recognize that nobody actually saw Earth hurling through space, yet the heliocentric model was well established based on inferences from many observations.\n \n The fact of biological evolution has been established by the same inductive scientific process. Sure the exact distribution of mass influenced how the planets came to be, but you don't need to know that to determine that they do indeed revolve around Sun (or strictly speaking, the center of mass, if you prefer).\n\n \n Try actually responding to my posts for once tester, rather than picking and choosing what you will respond to in order to avoid answering to the meat of my posts. How can an egregiously ignorant person who has no understanding of the issue being discussed even know enough to ask such direct questions about the information gaps upon which this theory of evolution is based? \n \n And now to the meat of your attempt at inductive reasoning; you say the fact of biological evolution has been established by the same inductive scientific process as our ability to deduce that our Planet revolves around the Sun? And this is an equivalent evidentiary scientific observation in your opinion, which comparably explains the validity of the theory of evolution? Let me show you why this reflects your ignorance and lack of appreciation for the depth of the issue we are discussing here.\n \n You are equating a current real time observable event such as the earth revolving around our Sun to an alleged event which is theorized to have occurred 4.5 billion years ago when it can't even be confirmed or proven in absolute terms that the Earth even existed at that time without making unverifiable assumptions which assume facts not in evidence, since they can't be tested in a laboratory, or repeated for consistency as evidence of the specific conditions that life could spontaneously sprout from. \n \n How many years have been invested, and how many chemicals have been combined under how many various conditions, have hundreds of scientists spent tens of thousands of man hours, in how many hundreds of labs around the world, and processed experiments under unique conditions in an attempt to replicate the alleged conditions which existed 4.5 billion years ago which led to spontaneous life beginning on Earth? \n \n And here's the truest evidence of the grasping at straws reality which this scientific method reflects; and that is that IF one of these experiments actually resulted in producing even the simplest living organism, it will be declared world wide that the process of abiogenesis has been finally confirmed and the original conditions on Earth which led to original life spontaneously beginning has been discovered, which will be held up as evidence that evolution is a fact. \n \n When the reality is that running experiments under perfect lab conditions is evidence of nothing at all regarding conditions which can't even be proven to have actually existed at all 4.5 billion years ago. But I guess it takes egregious ignorance like only I possess to question the appeal to popularity which your fallacious argument represents, huh? And since you don't actually answer any of my valid questions, but respond only by offering more fallacies, here are more reasons which prove the inconsistency of the man made religion you promote. \n \n DNA in &#8220;ancient&#8221; fossils. DNA extracted from bacteria that are supposed to be 425 million years old brings into question that age, because DNA could not last more than thousands of years.\n \n The data for &#8220;mitochondrial Eve&#8221; are consistent with a common origin of all humans several thousand years ago.\n \n Dinosaur blood cells, blood vessels, proteins (hemoglobin, osteocalcin, collagen) are not consistent with their supposed age, but make more sense if the remains are young.\n \n Thick, tightly bent strata without sign of melting or fracturing. E.g. the Kaibab upwarp in Grand Canyon indicates rapid folding before the sediments had time to solidify (the sand grains were not elongated under stress as would be expected if the rock had hardened). This wipes out hundreds of millions of years of time and is consistent with extremely rapid formation during the biblical Flood. SeeWarped earth.\n \n Polystrate fossils&#8212;tree trunks in coal (Auracaria spp. king billy pines, celery top pines, in southern hemisphere coal). There are also polystrate tree trunks in theYellowstone fossilized forests and Joggins, Nova Scotia and in many other places. Polystrate fossilized lycopod trunks occur in northern hemisphere coal, again indicating rapid burial / formation of the organic material that became coal.\n \n Experiments show that with conditions mimicking natural forces, oil forms quickly; it does not need millions of years, consistent with an age of thousands of years.\n \n The amount of salt in the world&#8217;s oldest lake contradicts its supposed age and suggests an age more consistent with its formation after Noah&#8217;s Flood.\n \n Observed examples of rapid canyon formation; for example, Providence Canyon in southwest Georgia, Burlingame Canyon near Walla Walla, Washington, and Lower Loowit Canyon near Mount St Helens. The rapidity of the formation of these canyons, which look similar to other canyons that supposedly took many millions of years to form, brings into question the supposed age of the canyons that no one saw form.\n \n Carbon-14 in coal suggests ages of thousands of years and clearly contradict ages of millions of years.\n \n Incongruent radioisotope dates using the same technique argue against trusting the dating methods that give millions of years.\n Incongruent radioisotope dates using different techniques argue against trusting the dating methods that give millions of years.\n Evidence of a period of rapid radioactive decay in the recent past (lead and helium concentrations and diffusion rates in zircons) point to a young earth explanation.\n \n Lifetime of long-period comets (orbital period greater than 200 years) that are sun-grazing comets or others like Hyakutake or Hale&#8211;Bopp means they could not have originated with the solar system 4.5 billion years ago. However, their existence is consistent with a young age for the solar system. Again an AD hoc Oort Cloud was invented to try to account for these comets still being present after billions of years. See, Comets and the age of the solar system.\n \n Human population growth. Less than 0.5% p.a. growth from six people 4,500 years ago would produce today&#8217;s population. Where are all the people? if we have been here much longer?http://www.dakotavoice.com/2009/06/evidence-of-the-age-of-planet-earth/\n \n \nHow typically pompous, sanctimonious and condescending that you will declare my profound ignorance for rejecting your secular humanist religion of evolution, yet none of you in more than 250 posts have posted one iota of absolutely undeniable evidence which proves that macro-evolution occurred, much less is even possible. All I have gotten are personal attacks on my intelligence, insults and opinions as you insist that your religion is correct. BUT NO EVIDENCE AT ALL! \n \n And how incredibly hypocritical that you consider my approach anti-rational when you haven't posted any rational evidence of your own. The double standards which exist here are unbelievable as your side sees only from one perspective as you accuse me of seeing from only one perspective. But the fact is I was once where you are at. By that I mean spiritually blind and dead to a greater truth. I know that statement offends you, but it's the absolute truth. Sadly a truth you are completely blind to.\n \n You also have real problems understanding plain english too. And that is most frustrating for me in attempting to reason with you and your cohorts. Regarding Matthew and his hypocritical position in claiming to be a believer as he defends your secular humanist and atheistic world views, I explained this to him in my most recent post to him, above, and it explains my position perfectly.\n \n \n \n \n \n And since nothing he says or defends aligns with the word of God which he claims to accept as true, it is easy proving that it is Matthew who is intellectually dishonest and a hypocrite even though he has accused me of being both of those things. Why haven't you criticized him for that tester? I am neither of those things as I stand ready to consistently defend my beliefs without compromise in every debate I participate in. But no defense for Archangel since he disagrees with you, right? I'm the philosophical enemy whom you can't defeat in honest debate, nor can you answer the questions regarding the inconsistencies in your religion of evo, so you just come here like some condescending boor and declare me ignorant to the max. \n \n WOW, what an impressive and convincing debating style you have. And very cowardly also. But that is to be expected from your side. OOPS, I did it again. emoticon_xdonno I went and honestly told you what I think of your opinion. :xbanghead\n\n \n \nIf you believe my posts on evolution are egregiously ignorant, then we have something else in common because that is precisely what I think of your pro evolution beliefs. For the life of me I can't comprehend how allegedly intelligent and educated people can swallow the evo drivel which you people do, hook line and sinker. \n \n I marvel at the incomprehensibility of it all. You have been deceived. You are believing a lie. You are adopting a false philosophy being sold as a science when it isn't even a valid or legitimate science. And what is worse you are attempting to defend something that you yourselves can't even find the absolutely undeniable evidence which proves that what YOU believe is an actual factual reality. How do you convince yourselves that a so called science is true, when you can't even prove it in absolute terms? \n \n Would you accept the science/mechanics that the internal combustion engine was real and valid if nobody ever actually got even one engine to run? I think not. You would say it's interesting in theory but the science doesn't work. And that would be a valid conclusion. But not with evolution. You will readily accept claims made about events which allegedly occurred starting @ 4.5 billion years ago. Events which can't be proven to have occurred at all, so they can't be repeated in a lab because the details of what allegedly occurred are unknown at every level of understanding.\n \n Can you tell me precisely what the temperature was back then? Precisely what chemicals made up the atmosphere, if any existed at all? Can you tell me the make up of the primordial ooze which your fairy tale asserts the first proteins or enzymes spontaneously appeared in? Or the temperature or chemical make up of the lava oceans which existed back then, from which the primordial ooze was synthesized over the first couple of billion years? \n \n And if I'm so egregiously ignorant tester, then how come I know enough to ask these questions which you giants of intellect have no hope of answering in another billion years? And if you don't know the answers to those initial, most basic questions regarding our origins of life on this planet according to your religions philosophy, then how egregiously ignorant is it of you to presume that the rest of the theory is at all rational? \n \n Now come back and tell me that I just don't get it tester. Tell me how ignorant I am as none of you can answer these questions from one source which will give absolute and verifiable evidence regarding the questions I have asked above. Now please forgive my ignorance. I hope I didn't embarrass myself again. emoticon_xdonno Oh, and by the way; I know I wont get an answer from you since you can't answer my questions. But I'm the ignorant one for asking them, right? And your side will once again come back and explain why Archangel is the dumb one around here to reject what any intelligent adult can plainly see is a fairy tale and a lie.\n",

The scientific method is simply a more formal version of this reasoning - with regards to evolution, scientists have directly observed phenomena such as speciation, 'rapid adaption', mutation and natural selection and are 'assuming' that such phenomena have applied to the planet's past and future, just as you assume that your kettle will always be hot when it has just boiled because you have previously observed this to be the case, or just as the doctor can surmise he's dealing with a burn victim because of past experience.\n \n As to the details about the very start of life on earth; it's not all that important.

DNA extracted from bacteria that are supposed to be 425 million years old brings into question that age, because DNA could not last more than thousands of years.\n\n \n In a biotic environment. In the absence of oxygen and enzymes, many organic molecules have degradation times of millions of years. I'd like to see the paper for a DNA molecule surviving intact for 425 million years, though.\n \n \nThe data for \"mitochondrial Eve\" are consistent with a common origin of all humans several thousand years ago.\n\n \n No. It's just an estimate for the last common ancestor of all humans living today. It's not the first human, and was never claimed to be.\n \n \nDinosaur blood cells, blood vessels, proteins (hemoglobin, osteocalcin, collagen) are not consistent with their supposed age, but make more sense if the remains are young.\n\n \n See above.

Kaibab Limestone is typically very well jointed and locally is brittely faulted.\n Structural geology of the Colorado ... - Google Books\n \n At places, it's even broken where it flexed. You've been played, my friend.\n \n \nPolystrate fossils-tree trunks in coal (Auracaria spp. king billy pines, celery top pines, in southern hemisphere coal). There are also polystrate tree trunks in theYellowstone fossilized forests and Joggins, Nova Scotia and in many other places. Polystrate fossilized lycopod trunks occur in northern hemisphere coal, again indicating rapid burial / formation of the organic material that became coal.\n\n \n Polystrate trees are forming in a lake by my house. Decades ago, a dam formed the lake, submerging and killing the trees. In a cove the sediments are slowly building, gradually covering the still-standing trunks. Eventually, if the whole area is covered, in a few million years, polystrate trees will result.\n \n \nExperiments show that with conditions mimicking natural forces, oil forms quickly; it does not need millions of years, consistent with an age of thousands of years.\n\n \n The experiments I've noted assume pressures and temperatures not seen in geological conditions were oil is found. And more importantly, the age of oil is not the age of the Earth.\n \n \nThe amount of salt in the world's oldest lake contradicts its supposed age and suggests an age more consistent with its formation after Noah's Flood.\n\n \n Lakes normally drain and lose salt with the water. The few that don't become very salty in a relatively short time, like Mono Lake, or the Dead Sea.\n \n \nObserved examples of rapid canyon formation; for example, Providence Canyon in southwest Georgia, Burlingame Canyon near Walla Walla, Washington, and Lower Loowit Canyon near Mount St Helens. The rapidity of the formation of these canyons, which look similar to other canyons that supposedly took many millions of years to form, brings into question the supposed age of the canyons that no one saw form.\n \n\n \n In fact, they don't look like ancient canyons. I've had a chance to see the Mt. St. Helens \"canyons.\" They are gulleys a few meters deep, which when they get much deeper, slump into the gulley. The sediment is far too soft to hold up at greater heights. For the Grand Canyon to have been so formed, you'd have to explain how a mile-high sheer wall of mud could exist.\n \n \n\n Carbon-14 in coal suggests ages of thousands of years and clearly contradict ages of millions of years.\n\n \n Two demonstrated sources of new C-14 in coal are bacteria (which grow in deep cracks in coal) and radioactive elements (which convert nitrogen to C-14)\n \n \nIncongruent radioisotope dates using the same technique argue against trusting the dating methods that give millions of years.\n Incongruent radioisotope dates using different techniques argue against trusting the dating methods that give millions of years.\n\n \n Let's take a look...\n \n Here's a direct comparison of different methods on rocks in two different places.\n http://gondwanaresearch.com/radiomet.htm\n \n Not quite what they told you it was, um?\n \n \nEvidence of a period of rapid radioactive decay in the recent past (lead and helium concentrations and diffusion rates in zircons) point to a young earth explanation.\n \n\n \n The problem with that is that there are still living things on Earth. If the rate had been as high as claimed, all living things would have been fried, and that would have been the end of it. Some local concentrations of material, such as the Oklo reactor happened, but that is consistent with present rates of decay.\n \n \nLifetime of long-period comets (orbital period greater than 200 years) that are sun-grazing comets or others like Hyakutake or Hale-Bopp means they could not have originated with the solar system 4.5 billion years ago. However, their existence is consistent with a young age for the solar system. Again an AD hoc Oort Cloud was invented to try to account for these comets still being present after billions of years. See, Comets and the age of the solar system.\n\n \n The same excuse used to be offered by creationists about short-period comets, until we were able to confirm the Kuyper Belt. The Oort cloud, which appears on many computer models of the solar system, is confirmed by the appearance of new long-period comets.\n \n \nHuman population growth. Less than 0.5% p.a. growth from six people 4,500 years ago would produce today's population. Where are all the people? if we have been here much longer?\n\n \n The same argument, applied to fruit flies, would mean the Earth would have to be about 40 meters deep in fruit flies.

   "Archangel, you seem to have misunderstood the principles of 'inductive reasoning' and are belittling the process of 'assumption' without quite grasping how prevalent it is in life. \n \n Inductive reasoning is what you use every second of every day of your life, when you put your foot down without looking at precisely where it's going to land (because you assume that the ground will still be there) or when you consider it safe to cross the road because you can't see any traffic approaching (and you assume that this is a true indicator that the road is safe to cross), or when you use your iphone to call a friend (because you assume that the scientific principles of electromagnetism are both true and currently in effect). The scientific method is simply a more formal version of this reasoning - with regards to evolution, scientists have directly observed phenomena such as speciation, 'rapid adaption', mutation and natural selection and are 'assuming' that such phenomena have applied to the planet's past and future, just as you assume that your kettle will always be hot when it has just boiled because you have previously observed this to be the case, or just as the doctor can surmise he's dealing with a burn victim because of past experience.\n \n As to the details about the very start of life on earth; it's not all that important. You don't need to know precisely the mass of the water in the kettle to know that you're still going to burn your hand.\n\n \n Of course Iangb, it must be Archangel who doesn't understand, or misunderstood the issue. It couldn't ever be you evolutionists who refuse to acknowledge that you are not only ignoring, but are breaking every established rule of proper and accepted scientific methodology which has always been required for validating REAL scientific conclusions. You refuse to admit that all of the current beliefs you hold to cannot be shown to be founded on anything solid in the way of actual scientific evidence and you seem oblivious to the importance of holding evolution up to the same standards that is required for every other type of science we rely on. \n \n But where evolution is concerned, apparently nothing more than inductive reasoning is necessary before coming to absolute conclusions regarding alleged events which supposedly occurred 4.5 BILLION YEARS AGO!!! Said events being the complete foundation upon which this modern theory for the origin of all life on Earth is based no less. Go figure huh? I mean, can a more important scientific issue be accepted as fact based on anymore flimsy evidence than you are offering here as you claim that it is I who don't get it? But once again, It must be Archangel who doesn't understand the intricacies cuz it could never be you pseudo intellectuals who can't prove or support any of your perceived claims who don't get it. That possibility would never occur to you, would it! \n \n You are in serious denial and all any of you have to fall back on is the repeated assertion that I don't get it when all I have asked for is real and trustworthy evidence that what you say occurred 4.5 BILLION YEARS AGO actually occurred. That isn't asking too much when we are discussing most important issue in life, which is how life on Earth came to be.",

But it's not to impute lying even to the Bible's human authors, let alone to God himself. A non-literally expressed truth is not a lie.\n \n As I said earlier, it is becoming increasingly clear -- especially since some comments you made on the abortion threads -- that the root of the problem is this: you make no distinction between how you understand scripture, and scripture itself. It's why you present quotes, but never explain them. You simply declare that the scriptures never come back void -- and then presume that they always come back to others the way they come back to you. Since your opponents thus know what the scriptures mean, when they disagree with you, it's because they're dishonestly ignoring what they know to be the meaning of scripture.\n \n \nStop that and I will debate evolution with you as a creationist against an evolutionist all day long without calling you a hypocrite..\n\n \n I'm not going to stop it, Archie.

You cannot claim to believe God is God and that He is truly infallible while at the same time rejecting His explanation for how we came to exist.\n \n \nSee, Arch, here's the thing.

Instead, you tell me that I myself already know that I'm wrong, and that I'm saying otherwise anyway. Which is to say, that I'm lying.\n\n \n Are you completely dense Matthew? I don't know how to make my explanation any more clear for you. I have explained in detail how you are wrong for claiming to believe in God through Jesus Christ, and to believe God is perfect in all respects, yet to not believe His explanation for how we came to be is to claim one thing yet to believe another. That either makes God a liar or you a hypocrite. I happen to know that you are the hypocrite since God isn't a liar.\n \n \nSo it's entirely personal. It has nothing to do with presenting reasons why what I say is not correct, and everything to do with confronting my character (as you see it, of course).\n\n \n It may feel personal to you but it is nothing more than an honest assessment by me of what you represent here. Stop claiming to be a believer in God through Christ, and in His word, when you have clearly stated that you don't believe His word as it is written. You can't have it both ways Matthew.\n \n \nBecause the fact is, I am not saying this at all. You are saying it about me. I have already said, on multiple occasions, that the Bible expresses truths, but in a non-literal fashion. If you wish to argue against that position, fine. But it's not to impute lying even to the Bible's human authors, let alone to God himself. A non-literally expressed truth is not a lie.\n\n \n See the bolded? It is a lie if it corrupts the intended literal truth being expressed in Gods word. You are arguing that it's ok for you to accept a non literal interpretation of the Genesis Account as you completely ignore it in favor of a secular humanist belief system known as biological evolution, which has absolutely no resemblance at all to the Genesis Account. So you explain to me what about your secular humanist explanation for how man came to exist is in any way similar to the Genesis account when it completely erases God from the equation? You may add God in by blending the two accounts, but you are simply corrupting the stated beliefs of both systems then. \n \n I mean, the theory asserts that 4.5 billion years ago all current life on Earth evolved from that original single celled organism which spontaneously sprang from the primordial ooze in a way which is unexplainable by evolutionists. How on Earth do you marry that origin up with God creating Man in His image for fellowship with the knowledge and understanding to name every creature on Earth which He also spoke into existence? Go on Matthew, explain that to me if you can!!! \n \n \nI'm not going to stop it, Archie. Because I honestly believe that God is our creator; that the Bible is not literally true, but nonetheless expresses spiritual truths; that life on this planet, including human life, evolved; and much else besides that is realated to these ideas. Honestly.\n\n \n Then by all means it falls upon you to explain to me, the literalist, how you can marry the Genesis account for a personal and intelligently designed creation with your version of biological evolution by way of random mutation. This I want to see. :xbanghead I need to understand how you connect the biblical version of creation which culminates in God creating humanity with total superiority and dominance over the animal kingdom which He created FOR us and to serve our needs, and your evolutionary version which teaches that we, the apex life form on Earth came at the very end of the evolution process and actually has evolved from the lower life forms we currently dominate, curiously enough, just as God said we would in my version of creation. You'll have to explain how that inconsistency between these two versions compliment each other Matthew according to your twisted world view. Prove and justify your interpretation of Genesis is reasonable and rational in any way if you hope to convince me that you aren't the spiritual hypocrite I'm accusing you of being.\n \n \nUntil you accept that I am an honest participant in the discussion and treat me accordingly, I shall not discuss anything further with you.\n\n \n Until you support your claims that the bible can be blended with evolution in a rational way, that just isn't going to happen. So invest in one more post and answer my questions above if you can. I'm betting you wont even try because you know very well that you are dealing with one student of the bible and evolution who knows the truth of what both represent. And you know very well that you can neither con me or bluff your way around the fact that evolution cannot be blended with the Genesis account in a rational and reasonable way. Just the two angles I have asked about above prove that fact. But go ahead and give it a shot if you're telling the truth in this paragraph \nI'm not going to stop it, Archie. Because I honestly believe that God is our creator; that the Bible is not literally true, but nonetheless expresses spiritual truths; that life on this planet, including human life, evolved; and much else besides that is realated to these ideas.

They are asking me to do something I have never even claimed to do.\n \n What I do claim is that evolution is fully compatible with the spiritual truths expressed by the Genesis account(s): that God is; that all things depend upon him for their existence; that through him all things are made good; that our potential for understanding and for goodness make us \"like\" God; and much, much more. In fact, I would say that many such truths are probably expressed by Genesis even on a literal interpretation!\n \n The question is, in order for these truths to be revealed, must the depiction of the events be a literally true, historically accurate account? That's where my answer is, \"No.\" The scriptures are allegory: literally false, but revealing the truth.\n \n Believe it or not, I even believe the Bible is divinely inspired. But as I once said to Marc, I don't think any amount of divine inspiration can eliminate our intellectual and moral finitude and fallibility -- not even in the case of the authors of the Bible. Sometimes, the all-too-human appears in the text. But I don't think that makes the authors liars, and still less would I hold God responsible for any of their failings. More importantly, it certainly doesn't lessen the profound impact that the scriptures can have in one's life, and in one's relationship to God.\n \n \n...\n \n I mean, the theory [of evolution] asserts that 4.5 billion years ago all current life on Earth evolved from that original single celled organism which spontaneously sprang from the primordial ooze in a way which is unexplainable by evolutionists. How on Earth do you marry that origin up with God creating Man in His image for fellowship with the knowledge and understanding to name every creature on Earth which He also spoke into existence? Go on Matthew, explain that to me if you can!!!\n\n \n I was originally going to respond to your whole post, point by point. But I'm going to keep this shorter and cut most of that. Not, mind you, because I'm hypocritical or dishonest or lazy, but because I'm trying to avoid a needlessly repetitive response. You see, almost everything kept revolving around the same basic problem, and the above seems to illustrate it well. Namely:\n \n You keep asking me to reconcile evolution with the events depicted in Genesis, i.e., with the literal interpretation. But I've never even claimed to do this, Archie! What I claim is that evolution can be reconciled to the spiritual truths expressed in Genesis. And that's a different ball of wax entirely.\n \n There is, however, one spot that seemed to indicate a somewhat different difficulty. And it's what came next.\n \n \nThen by all means it falls upon you to explain to me, the literalist, how you can marry the Genesis account for a personal and intelligently designed creation with your version of biological evolution by way of random mutation.\n\n \n Here the point seems not to be about the Genesis account specifically, but about the more general theological \"problem of evil.\" Certainly, there are some evolutionists -- and Richard Dawkins springs readily to mind here -- who think that the realities of suffering are not compatible with a benevolent God. This seems to be what you're driving at by invoking \"design\" against \"randomness.\" Forgive me if I've misconstrued the thrust of this particular comment.\n \n But on this score, I've never understood why evolution is any greater or lesser threat to religion than any other natural phenomenon. If one does not consider humanly unpredictable natural events like earthquakes and tsunamis to threaten supernatural design, then one shouldn't take humanly unpredictable natural events like genetic mutations to threaten it, either.\n \n All that evolution does is locate a great deal of unpredictable unpleasantness within the entire process of life itself. In fact, one could actually make a case for a certain convergence of the evolutionary view and the Biblical view in some respects. Consider stories like the Fall and its consequences, or the Book of Job.\n \n And is what these stories say about the human condition -- and how to deal with it -- really lessened by taking them non-literally? Personally, I think not.\n \n \n...\n \n So invest in one more post and answer my questions above if you can. I'm betting you wont even try...\n\n \n Well, I did try. But I'm pretty sure I can't answer those questions.\n \n Before you congratulate yourself too quickly, however, let me point out that this is not because I am the hypocrite you claim I am. It's because what you're asking simply doesn't make sense. I don't hold that the Bible is literally true, yet you keep asking me to reconcile evolution with the literal interpretation.\n \n What I claim is that evolution is not compatible with a literal interpretation of Genesis. And that, I'm guessing, is a point about which you and I agree! (Will wonders never cease? :))\n \n But I also claim that evolution is compatible with spiritual truths that can be revealed even by a non-literal interpretation. And I'm also guessing that this is where we disagree, at a fundamental level: I take it that spiritual truths can be revealed even if the literal depictions are false, whereas you think &#8211; and correct me if I'm wrong &#8211; that spiritual truths can be revealed only if the literal depictions are true.\n \n Sound about right?\n \n And finally, from your subsequent post:\n \n \n Or how about [Neil Shubin&#8217;s Your Inner Fish: A Journey into the 3.5 Billion Year History of the Human Body]. This meshes perfectly with the Genesis account, doesn't it Matthew?\n\n \n With the events literally depicted in Genesis? Of course not. But with the spiritual truths expressed by Genesis? Absolutely.\n \n Remember: I do not interpret the Bible literally. I may be wrong about that, and you&#8217;re welcome to explain why. But I&#8217;m not being inconsistent when I say that both evolutionary biology and Genesis are true. Evolution is true as an explanation of certain natural processes. Genesis is true as an expression of God&#8217;s relationship to all such natural processes. There&#8217;s nothing inconsistent about that.",

   "Archie, I do not believe the Genesis account is \"His explanation for how we came to exist.\" I believe that the Genesis accounts of creation are a pair of human expressions of what it means for God to be the creator of the universe and the world and life and humanity. I do not interpret it literally.\n\n \n You constantly prove you are interpreting the bible/the creation account from a fleshly/liberal perspective rather than from a spiritual perspective. And your constant reference to the TWO allegedly contradictory versions of Creation in Chapters 1 and 2 are perfect examples of the truth of this assessment. Here is an admitted theological apologetics site which deals with this issue rather than me just insisting how wrong your fleshly perceptions are. Apologetics Press - Are There Two Creation Accounts in Genesis?\n \n And your deductive reasoning is fallacious on every level of rationale if you are serious about having a philosophical debate which comes to concrete conclusions. Your following statement defines the problem with attempting to reason with you.\n \n \nMuch of your post asks me to square scientific cosmological and biological ideas with Genesis. If one interprets Genesis literally, then I myself will happily acknowledge that this cannot be done! But to reiterate my point, I do not think Genesis must be or even should be interpreted literally. So all those demands are beside the point. They are asking me to do something I have never even claimed to do.\n\n \n Here's the problem Matthew, you are copping out by declaring that just because you don't interpret Genesis literally that you don't have to even consider what it plainly and directly says in comparison to what your evolution perspective claims happened. We are debating what each philosophy promotes so discussing what they actually say is not only valid but required in order to objectively consider the consistency of each philosophy. \n \n You have stated that evolution is fully compatible with the spiritual truths expressed by the Genesis account even though it doesn't agree with it in specific terms. I have asked you to explain how that can be, but you refuse to explain yourself by saying that because you don't interpret the bible literally, you needn't consider it in those terms. Well that isn't the way debates work. You needn't agree with a literal interpretation of Genesis in order to observe and judge the differences which are glaring and obvious between the two belief systems. \n \n In other words, just because you don't interpret Genesis literally, that doesn't mean you can't discuss the obvious contradictions which exist between how I interpret it and how you interpret evolution, just as I have discussed it by pointing out the contradictions I observe between the two philosophies. \n \n \nWhat I do claim is that evolution is fully compatible with the spiritual truths expressed by the Genesis account(s): that God is; that all things depend upon him for their existence; that through him all things are made good; that our potential for understanding and for goodness make us \"like\" God; and much, much more. In fact, I would say that many such truths are probably expressed by Genesis even on a literal interpretation!\n\n \n These issues are fine and relevant in a discussion about moral principles and Gods values in the bible, but what do they have to do with what we are discussing in regard to the literal events of creation as compared to the literal beliefs of evolution? The answer is nothing. You are attempting to justify avoiding directly answering my challenge to explain how evolution can be married with the literal interpretation of Genesis just because you don't literally interpret Genesis. When the issue is that you have plainly said originally, that the two belief systems don't contradict each other. But of course they do, just as I said they do. \n \n \nThe question is, in order for these truths to be revealed, must the depiction of the events be a literally true, historically accurate account? That's where my answer is, \"No.\" The scriptures are allegory: literally false, but revealing the truth.\n\n \n This is irrational and inconsistent gibberish Matthew. There is nothing about the Genesis account of creation which is written in the allegorical style of writing. You are forcing that label on it where no literary evidence of that is evident at all. Tell me what it allegorical about this, in any way?\n Gen 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\n Gen 1:2 The earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God was moving over the face of the waters.\n Gen 1:3 And God said, \"Let there be light\"; and there was light.\n Gen 1:4 And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness.\n Gen 1:5 God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.\n Gen 1:6 And God said, \"Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.\"\n Gen 1:7 And God made the firmament and separated the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so.\n Gen 1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.\n Gen 1:9 And God said, \"Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.\" And it was so.\n Gen 1:10 God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.\n Gen 1:11 And God said, \"Let the earth put forth vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, upon the earth.\" And it was so.\n Gen 1:12 The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.\n Gen 1:13 And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.\n Gen 1:14 And God said, \"Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years,\n Gen 1:15 and let them be lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth.\" And it was so.\n Gen 1:16 And God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; he made the stars also.\n Gen 1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth,\n Gen 1:18 to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.\n Gen 1:19 And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.\n Gen 1:20 And God said, \"Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the firmament of the heavens.\"\n Gen 1:21 So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.\n Gen 1:22 And God blessed them, saying, \"Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.\"\n Gen 1:23 And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.\n Gen 1:24 And God said, \"Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.\" And it was so.\n Gen 1:25 And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the cattle according to their kinds, and everything that creeps upon the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.\n Gen 1:26 Then God said, \"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.\"\n Gen 1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.\n Gen 1:28 And God blessed them, and God said to them, \"Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.\"\n Gen 1:29 And God said, \"Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food.\n Gen 1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.\" And it was so.\n Gen 1:31 And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.\n No matter how you cut it, you are denying the truth of Gods version for His personal and very intelligent design and creation of Man in His image. He mentions nowhere that we grew from lower life forms over millions or billions of years. In fact He says just the opposite. You are attempting to compromise His explanation for creation with a man made secular view in which the only literal aspect I can surmise from it is your attempt to blend the two philosophies where none is possible in a rational or realistic way.",

Has been for decades. And I don't know that the dividing line can be made as sharp as many of us on each side of the debate sometimes state or imply. \n\n \n I agree - It can't. We have a best selling book called \"How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist\", we have Kenneth Miller saying that science shows God more vividly than Bible study possibly can, and we have many scientists saying that science does not/cannot address the existance of God at all. Yet someone here (maybe not you - I don't remember exactly who) telling Archangel that he doesn't understand science. If we can't put an accurate finger on where the line is between philosophy and science, that's not a fair accusation. \n \n \nBut of course, if the point is to criticize someone's distinction, then \"who's to say\" criticisms could go either way. Right? \n\n \n But they seldom do. Practically no one in the scientific community is going to accuse Victor Stenger of not understanding science. Is his book title a lie or isn't it? \n \n \n \nCome now. Most of the reasoning you're dancing through here is thoroughly ad hominem. It's not rude, and far from insulting or offensive. But it's directed at me, not at what I say, which is ad hominem. \n\n \n It's simply an equal response to your posts like #241, 250, or 253. They're not rude on your part, and not directly insulting or offensive to me, but they're positive comments to those few who do nothing (concerning me) other than making ad hominem posts. On a level distinctively higher than anything Archangel does against any one at any time. Archangel does not use vulgar language, for example. \n \n \nIf, as you say, \"the words I post are by far good enough,\" then why not address those instead of indulge in psychological speculations about me?\n\n \n See above. :)\n \n \n \n \nBut not to my arguments. What I say stands or falls on its own merits. Whomever I happen to agree or disagree with, or whatever emotions I may or may not motivate me, are completely irrelevant.\n \n Either my case is a good one, or it isn't. And either way, it's a matter of the reasons given, not any features about me.\n\n \n I don't agree - there are psycological advantages/disadvantages in debating. They're a large part of the foundation of the \"logical fallacy\" lists. Not that I agree with them all, but \"argument by emotive language\" really can sway an observer.",

You don't separate yourself from Archie, despite that so many of us here consider his behavior frequently rude. Should we judge you based on your association with him? Or should we perhaps deal with you as an individual? \n\n \n I'm dealt with from both of those positions quite a bit! :) I don't really care. \n \n \nI have been on the receiving end for years. Not at present, thank heavens. But I dealt with exactly this sort of thing within the church, primarily during my twenties. And my father, who is a minister, often had it worse.\n \n But of course, my large point is: none of this matters! What I believe, what my dad believes, what you believe, what Archie believes -- none of it is either true or false just because any of us objectively is or subjectively feels persecuted by the powers that be. \n\n \n But I'm talking about its debate, and how an observer can be swayed by things other than facts. Young, impressionable minds, that will be making political decisions soon. \n \n \nI was not suggesting that Christians should be quiet. I was suggesting that they should be respectful and kind. \n\n \n There is a time for everything. A time to be respectful and kind, and a time to overturn the tables of the moneychangers. emoticon_xangel\n \n \nMarc, I would love that. (And there is so! ;)) Just let me know. \n\n \n Archangel has started it in this thread, so I'll make a brief reference to it here. Maybe we can continue it in the appropriate forum. \n \n \nA concluding tangent: I do apologize for not getting back to you with regard to the other posts. At this point, maybe it's okay to let it go. I imagine we're going to have plenty of opportunity to cover similar territory. \n\n \n No problem. \n \n \nI would like to address the meaning of John 10:30, though. I did some research into it, and into the 82nd Psalm, to which Jesus refers in the surrounding verses. Maybe that's another topic we could explore over on the religion threads. Like I said, let me know.\n\n \n That's fine, take your time, get well soon!",

   "The question is, in order for these truths to be revealed, must the depiction of the events be a literally true, historically accurate account? That's where my answer is, \"No.\" The scriptures are allegory: literally false, but revealing the truth. \n\n \n If scriptures are literally false, but spiritually true, what is evolution? Is it literally true? If evolution is literally true and scriptures are spiritually true, there's not much question about which is going to be the ruling realm in a society, and which will be the subordinate realm, is there? \n \n Or can we call evolution theoretically true?

   "You constantly prove you are interpreting the bible/the creation account from a fleshly/liberal perspective rather than from a spiritual perspective. And your constant reference to the TWO allegedly contradictory versions of Creation in Chapters 1 and 2 are perfect examples of the truth of this assessment. Here is an admitted theological apologetics site which deals with this issue rather than me just insisting how wrong your fleshly perceptions are. Apologetics Press - Are There Two Creation Accounts in Genesis?\n\n \n That's a good link, but a long one, probably beyond the patience of most evolutionists. I'll try to condense it in this post - it's really quite simple. (as my 9th grade algebra teacher used to say :p)\n \n From that link;\n \n \nFifth, it is argued that Genesis 1 represents animals as existing before man (24-26), yet Genesis 2 has Adam created before the animals are formed (19). The text of Genesis 2:19 merely suggests that the animals were formed before being brought to man; it says nothing about the relative origins of man and beast in terms of chronology. The critic is reading something into the text that simply is not there. \n (boldface mine)\n \n \n Genesis 2 is not chronology, whereas Genesis 1 is. Most verses in chapter two begin with the word \"and\". It does not say \"and then\" it just says \"and\". It is outlining how things are, not in the order that they were created. Genesis two is about the first humans, and a description of the place of habitation for them. That's all Genesis 2 is. \n \n Another good, and brief, link on the subject;\n \n Ask.com Search Engine - Better Web Search\n \n \n \nGenesis 1 is the account of the creation of the universe and life on planet earth as it happened in chronological sequence. Genesis 2 is simply an expanded explanation of the events that occurred at the end of the sixth creation day - when God created human beings. Genesis one provides virtually no details about the creation of human beings (other than the idea that humans were created in the image of God). For a book that is dedicated to the relationship between humans and God, four verses seems like a rather poor explanation for the creation of God's preeminent creature. This is because Genesis one was never intended to stand apart from Genesis 2 and 3. Genesis 2 describes God's preparation of a specific location on earth (Eden) for habitation by the first human beings. Part of the confusion results from our English translations, which use the term \"earth\" when the Hebrew would better be translated \"land.\" \n\n \n Those who are quick to read an English translation of the Bible and declare a contradiction also should keep in mind how the original language was used in that day and time. Sometimes language translations cannot be done perfectly. References to Bible scholars who are fluent in the original languages can sometimes be very revealing.",

You know, the process explained in this link which you all have completely ignored? Scientific Method Uses Experiments and Controls: Good Experiments and Controls Generate Valid Scientific Conclusions | Suite101.com Can you explain that to me? \n \n Of course now you are asking me to accept your interpretation of observations which you assert are evidence that evolution is valid, right? But isn't TRUE science based on repeatable and verifiable experiments under controlled conditions which are based on proven variables necessary to avoid misinterpretations based on appearances? Of course they are. Yet you seem not only willing to, but committed to ignoring this SOP of science by this pseudo science which is more of a philosophy than an actual science, in order to come to the preferred conclusions you insist are reality but have no real evidence for. Then you say this:\n \n \nThe thing is, measuring evolution is exactly the same. We make observations. We SEE it happen in labs. From a genetic perspective, it can be shown to happen all the time and this is without ANY historical evidence. We don't even need the wealth of fossil data to show this. To deny it is possible (even POSSIBLE) is simply absurd. You are blinded by your faith and you don't even know it.\n\n \n Are you saying we see macroevolution happen in labs through the process of genetic macroevolution? Can you post evidence that a virus or a biological protein has ever evolved into anything other than a different \"strain\" of what it started out as? Or that one species of animal has actually and verifiably evolved into another species of animal? You know, can you document that all mammals have evolved from reptiles, fish or amphibians ? Or even that amphibians have evolved from fish as evolution claims occurred in reality? You cannot show even that evolutionary leap in reality with absolutely documented and verified genetic or physical evidence.\n \n Your arguments are rife with generalized insistence that you are right with no solid evidence of anything you claim is true. Your whole arsenal of so called evidence is a conglomeration of carefully worded conclusions which are derived from unprovable assumptions. Yet you continue to make them and insist that although evidence exists, you refuse to actually post that evidence. I must terminally suffer the repeated claims of evidence while never seeing that actual evidence.\n \n And when someone finally does produce some obscure experiment about claimed macroevolution occurring as Iangb did here: E. coli long-term evolution experiment - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia we see very clearly that after more than 40,000 generations of evolution over a 20 year period, this e coli never evolved into another species of life at all, only a different strain of e coli. Yet, Iangb posted this link as evidence of macroevolution occurring in the lab. \n \n So come back and post actual evidence of macroevolution occurring under any circumstances. Of course proving extra-species macroevolution has occurred naturally in the wild is the ultimate claim of evolution so should be fairly easy to document, no? So document it then rather than continuously insisting that I just believe your unsubstantiated claims. \n \n And just for argument sake, would any of you care to document the equivalent number of years 40,000 generations represent in human terms? I mean, if we use just 20 years per generation, rather than the modern standard of 40 years, it represents 800,000 years of human evolution. Here is what is claimed to have existed 800,000 years ago: Homo cepranensis - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia but note that this classification of human is based on only one skull cap found in Italy. This is what is accepted by evolution as a chain of evidence even though the explanation admits that not enough info exists to come to any absolute conclusions at all regarding this fossil. Yet it is still in the record as a link in human evolution. This is what you call an unbroken chain of undeniable evidence which proves that evolution is a valid and documented science? Really?

Which is why I have debated evolution completely on your level without pitting the spiritual principles of the bible against the pseudo scientific claims of evolutions myth. But you go right ahead and attack my spiritual perspective of how life came to be. You just further expose your ignorance by not recognizing the difference between a spiritual explanation and an allegedly scientific one which I have successfully refuted at every turn, resulting in turning you into the guy who wrote the inane post above which I am responding to now. But like I said, welcome aboard. I've worn these old time evolutionists out and having you to play with was fun for the couple of posts that you held in there for. emoticon_xhoho \n \n Oh, and one more thing my lost friend. People like you have been saying that God and His word are things of the past for thousands of years now, yet here we are in the 21st century and His word and followers of HIM like me still exist in droves. So remember, because this applies directly to you. The wisdom of this world is foolishness to God. And one of the false philosophies he was referring to in that passage is evolution.

This is true even if your reasoning is as simple as, \"This idea contradicts my religion, therefore it is untrue.\" \n \n I do commend you for being honest, gansao. Arch would have only said something to the effect of me not understanding the power what I am reading. I can read and understand English, thank you. \n \n We are on different wavelengths. I choose to believe what I can see, find evidence for, or prove. Christians tend to place logic and reasoning secondary to their faith. I could go on to attribute this to childhood brainwashing, but I do respect your belief. I just don't agree with it. ?\n\n It's people like your goodself that keep me coming back to this forum Databed.\n We have had a very strong debate without insults.\n I am in fact the worst of Christians. I believe that the message of Christ is far more important than the story and I have a leaning towards Buddhism.\n I suppose therefore I am not a Christian but I think that the creationists raise reasonable points that are simply ignored by others.\n Your first paragraph is exactly right and that is why creationists and science will never agree.\n Archangel knows his God. He is at peace with himself and God and knows that when Christ returns he will be accepted by him. I envy that.\n \n \n \n \nCan you explain how science is an approximation?\n\n \n Without getting too metaphysical just let me give an example.\n \n The Apollo moon shot calculations to get the spacecraft to the moon and back used Newtonian physics knowing that the General theory of relativity was a more accurate theory.\n I understand that Newtonian physics was quite accurate enough do the job.\n Newtonian physics was an approximation..nearly the correct explanation but was supplanted by Einstein. Einsteins classical physics are today known not to be the exact explanation ...string theory seems to make more sense except there are several different versions but they need multiple dimensions .....................................................",

   ".....Excepting that the entire house of cards is predicated on the existence of a magical supernatural entity for which there is no evidence whatever.\n\n \n Speaking of magic, how do you explain the spontaneous appearance of original life on Earth this alleged 4.5 billion years ago? Oh wait, you can't explain it. Which is why you guys even theorize alien origins for the first signs of life on primordial earth via exogenesis. \n \n Origin of life: Alien origin taken seriously? Ghost of Francis Crick smiles wanly\n According to Matthew Hutson at Popular Mechanics, \"5 Projects Ask if Life on Earth Began as Alien Life in Space\" (December 16, 2008):\n \n For years, scientists have considered the possibility of exogenesis, the idea that life arrived on Earth from another planet, and not just the building blocks of life, but organisms that were ready to rock and roll when they arrived. It's a Rube Goldberg scenario, however, dependent on several successful steps. First, life has to evolve on an alien planet. Then it must be blasted into space on a rock, probably from a large impact. Assuming it survives a long journey through harsh conditions-and makes its way into our neighborhood-life then has to resist fiery atmospheric entry and a brutal landing before trying to make a new home for itself.\n Five projects. I wonder if the ghost of Francis Crick is their patron saint? (The double helix guy believed, controversially, that life must have come from outer space.)\n Colliding Universes: Origin of life: Alien origin taken seriously? Ghost of Francis Crick smiles wanly\n \n You remember Crick from earlier in the debate don't you? The guy who said that a 747 self constructing from the parts in a junk yard is more likely than life spontaneously appearing in a harsh and uninviting primordial earth. HERE'S MORE ON THAT SUBJECT:\n Origin of life: There must be life out there! vs. There can't be life out there!\n Robert Deyes provides a helpful summary of the see-saw between the belief that life must exist on other planets (inevitablists) and that it cannot (impossiblists):\n 'Life, Life Everywhere' was the title of a 1996 article in Scientific American that focused on the crucial question of whether the origins of life were truly an inevitable consequence of some fundamental natural tendency in the universe towards great complexity (Ref 2). From our modern stand point, it was really Fred Hoyle that challenged this 'inevitablist' school by proclaiming vehemently that, \"the emergence of a living cell from an inanimate chemical soup is about as likely as the assembly of a 747 by a whirlwind passing through a junkyard\" (Ref 2). So the modern 'improbabilist' was born, taking on the contrasting inevitabilist view in a head to head intellectual battle. While the inevitabilists used the sudden appearance of the cell almost 3.85 billion years ago (Ref 3) as evidence of life's inevitability, improbabilists such as the late Francis Crick proposed that life was unlikely to have arisen on earth and must have been seeded from outer space (Ref 2). After all if life were truly a rare phenomenon, space transportation networks would have been required to spread it around hospitable planets.\n Hmmm. The middle ground between inevitable and impossible is about as solid as the middle of a Lifesaver.Colliding Universes: Origin of life: There must be life out there! vs. There can't be life out there!\n \n SO WHAT IS IT YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT MAGIC PINFOLD? ARE YOU ACTUALLY ARGUING THAT YOUR MYTHICAL AND FALSE RELIGION OF EVOLUTION IS NOT FOUNDED IN THE BELIEF IN MAGIC?",

Not very consistent, or even truthful of you Db.\n \n \n Many beliefs that you hold true are not testable. We cannot, for instance, prove the sun is present at any present instance in time. We can only prove that it has existed.\n\n \n Maybe in your simple mind this is a valid opinion. But not in my mind which knows absolutely that our Sun is a literal and testable 93 million miles from earth and is as consistent as the day is long. Pun completely intended, if you can grasp it. emoticon_xgood\n \n \n As for evolution, we can make it painfully obvious through scientific study that evolution happens, we can run experiments to back it up, we can literally read the unwritten historical evidence, we can CONTROL evolution to produce desired outcomes. We can tinker with genetics and create desired results. We have an understanding of how these mechanisms work. We're not XXXXXX as human beings.\n\n \n Really? This is your definition of science? And you say we can control evolution to produce desired outcomes which support evolutions claim that macroevolution is real and simply speaking, has actually led to man evolving from fish as evolution teaches occurred in reality? Would you produce evidence of extra-species evolution which shows that one species/type/genus of animal has evolved from another species/type/genus? Forgive my redundancy, but I have learned that I must be very precise in order to not allow your side the wiggle room to purposely misrepresent what I am asking you to prove. \n \n \nScience is about finding patterns in nature. We use rules that we have discovered to predict outcomes of events. We can predict what we will find when we unearth an area of land. We go looking for a missing link, sometimes we find it. Sometime we don't. But NEVER have we found even one iota of evidence that evolution is false. Don't you think its about time we did...i mean, if evolution is a fairy tail and all?\n\n \n Speaking of patterns in nature and their interpretation by both sides of this debate; this raises an argument I have repeatedly made which has been widely ignored by you in this debate, and before you appeared here, by your cohorts. And that is that we creationists don't ignore or deny any of the physical observations you evolutionists see, at all. From fossils to the layers of strata they are found in, to geology, cosmology or quantum mechanics and physics. What we do is interpret those observations differently than you do. We see the fossil record as evidence that the various layers of strata and fossils were laid down quickly, The 1993 Midwest Floods and Rapid Canyon Formation in fact rapidly which explains why they have survived intact where as we have, and I have posted time lapse film of animals being completely consumed into non existence in less than a week in the wild today. Be it by insect consumption and scavengers carrying off the remains as shown here: YouTube - Rabbit decomposition (time-lapse video) in post 123 of this thread. Here is that post so you can read my complete argument from it: http://www.4forums.com/political/366776-post123.html\n \n You evolution apologists have no response to these realities as you imagine that the ancient dead animals just laid there, never decomposing or being consumed by scavengers as the earth slowly buried them perfectly intact for us to find in the distant future. So I ask again Db, who is it that is preaching magic and outrageous fairy tales in insisting that what you preach is even the least bit rational or reasonable? \n \n \nAgain I stress that the only reason you don't believe in evolution is because your blind faith does not allow it. I'm not saying its a conscious decision on your part, you simply don't realize your blinded.\n\n \n Wrong again Db, my faith is not blind at all. I have personally tested and questioned every single aspect of my world view. And since we both rely on faith in holding to what we believe, I know that He whom I rely is faithful, true and trustworthy since He is real and all encompassing. You, on the other hand are placing your faith in fallen and flawed Man in accepting the man made religion of evolution which is so inconsistent and irrational as to ignore known decomposition rates as they insist that the fossil record as they define it is rational at all. emoticon_xdonno Get a clue my friend, you are not only lying to yourself, you are believing the lies and deceptions of others.",

   "When I saw the posts that followed, I realized that attempting to correct you would just be a waste of time. So I waited till something worth responding to was posted. And accipiters post asking for scientific evidence for supernatural occurrences was sufficiently ignorant as to demand a response.\n\n \n Ok, well i'm still waiting. You're still stalling.\n \n \n \nAs to your question you keep harping about, science is not always testable, and there is no a criteria for it to be. The scientific method is a set of rules for running an experiment. It is not necessary, however, to perform science. Science has theoretical branches as well that can never be tested.\n\n \n Ahh, then why do you constantly insist that evolution is a reliable and tested science based on rational conclusions when you now admit that it is a theoretical branch which can never be tested or proven to be sound? Not very consistent, or even truthful of you Db.\n\n \n You took me out of context you know. I didn't say evolution was theoretical science but when I wrote I did suspect you would make this claim. Evolution is time-tested. It has withstood the scrutiny and pseudoscience of many thousands of crazies like you and nothing has debunked it as of yet. \n \n \nMaybe in your simple mind this is a valid opinion. But not in my mind which knows absolutely that our Sun is a literal and testable 93 million miles from earth and is as consistent as the day is long. Pun completely intended, if you can grasp it. \n\n \n You didn't even get it. You feel the heat, see light from the Sun as it was 7 minutes ago. If it exploded you could never know it for seven minutes no matter what tests you performed.\n \n \nReally? This is your definition of science? And you say we can control evolution to produce desired outcomes which support evolutions claim that macroevolution is real and simply speaking, has actually led to man evolving from fish as evolution teaches occurred in reality? Would you produce evidence of extra-species evolution which shows that one species/type/genus of animal has evolved from another species/type/genus? Forgive my redundancy, but I have learned that I must be very precise in order to not allow your side the wiggle room to purposely misrepresent what I am asking you to prove.\n \n \n Stop falling back on macro-evolution. You need to convince me there are two different things. Micro and macro evolution are the same thing. To believe in one is to believe in both, therefore your statement here is irrelevant to me. You're the one who is wiggling here and putting words in my mouth and until you can stop doing that, you will continue to sound ignorant.\n \n \nWhat we do is interpret those observations differently than you do.\n\n \n Some honesty in this statement. Thank you.\n \n \nI have posted time lapse film of animals being completely consumed into non existence in less than a week in the wild today.\n\n \n You can't be serious. There are lots of different scenarios creatures can be caught in that result in fossilization be it peat bogs, tar pits, floods, river crossings etc. Just because you found one that won't result in fossilization doesn't mean it can't happen. Do you honestly believe we think that fossilization is inevitable and that all the billions upon billions of creatures that ever existed would be fossils now. Give me a break.\n \n \nI have personally tested and questioned every single aspect of my world view.\n \n \n Really? Did you use the scientific method?\n \n \nAnd you say we can control evolution to produce desired outcomes which support evolutions claim that macroevolution is real and simply speaking, has actually led to man evolving from fish as evolution teaches occurred in reality?\n\n \n Look at the difference between a Great Dane and a Chihuahua. That was the result of controlled evolution (selective breeding). I know you're argument is going to be that they are still the same species, falling back on some scientific definition of speciation, but that took a few hundred years to complete. It is not much of a stretch to see it going much further in a time frame of millions of years. I might add that a Chihuahua and a Great Dane cannot mate without human intervention and by some definitions would be considered a different species. I figure you will direct me to something on gene flow at this point.",

   "Sure, I apologize. But we have posted plenty of evidence that should at least be considered. The fact is that is is not being considered, and I believe it is due to the reason listed above.\n\n \n You personally haven't posted one iota of evidence at all on this complete thread since showing up, so I don't know what you mean by this all inclusive \"WE\" you speak of. Also, I have read the so called evidence and refuted what was worthy of responding to. I have told these mooks on numerous occasions that I don't respond to Talk Origin links which exists solely for the purpose of responding to every Creationist perspective with evolution talking points which do nothing but promote the very lies I have effectively refuted to the frustration of you and your cohorts.\n \n \n I pose to Arch, just as he does to us, Biblical creation cannot be true due to the fact that we see no evidence ANYWHERE. There is no evidence of a global flood. There's not enough water to flood the world.\n\n \n This is another untruth which is promoted by secular humanists and is founded in willful ignorance that there is another way to interpret all of the same geological evidence we all have access to. In fact the complete fossil record and the strata it is found in is accepted by creationists as evidence of the Great Flood. Our disagreement is not in the available evidence but in the interpretation of it which you stubbornly claim as proving your perspective but what I insist proves mine. So lets begin this exchange by agreeing that we both claim the same physical evidence which we interpret differently. You have no upper hand here regarding the physical evidence we observe in the natural world Db.\n \n \n There is no evidence for Adam and Eve. In fact, the simple fact that we have found pre-homo sapiens hominids already disproves this account. We see fossil evidence for animals existing way before any humans.\n\n \n Really? There is no genetic evidence for a common ancestor who is much more recent than 3 1/2 million years ago when evolution claims the earliest humans broke off from primates? I suppose you have never heard of the Mitochondrial Eve and biblical Eve are looking good: criticism of young age is premature The problem with debating you evolutionists is that you never bother even looking at the other side of the story.\n \n \nThe Bible contains absolutely NO information that was not commonly known at the time it was written. It doesn't include anything about other galaxies, solar systems, or even anything about the other 75% of the globe that had not yet been explored. \n\n \n The bible is chock full of information that wasn't readily known at that time. The problem is it's too voluminous for me to outline for you. It would require actually studying it and educating yourself in order to discover the truth for yourself. Also, how many solar systems do you believe exist within our universe? \n \n \n It also contains nothing about dinosaurs or any of the extinct animals that had not been discovered. Shouldn't have God accounted for these things?\n\n \n He did. You are just too ignorant to know the contents of what the bible actually says. Because it does mention dinosaurs. They just weren't called dinosaurs when the bible was written. They were called Leviathan, Behemoth and Beasts. Here are the passages which describe them. Dinosaurs and the Bible\n \n \n I realize that Christians have explained away the age of the Earth by saying God is not temporal. This is not in the Bible I might add, but even if it was, didn't it take definitive proof of the age of the Earth before this was used by creationists to account for an old Earth?\n\n \n You should stick to defending your religion rather than mine because I don't know what you're talking about here. What I can say is that Jesus Himself said that man has existed since the beginning of creation, and here's the passage where he says it in defense of how God has always believed in the unity between a man and a woman.\n Mar 10:5 And Jesus answered and said to them, \"Because of the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.\n Mar 10:6 But from the beginning of the creation, God 'made them male and female.' [fn]\n Mar 10:7 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife,\n \nMaybe not exactly on the subject of creation, but relevant still: There is no evidence that God carved any stone tablets. In fact, it makes sense that people were deceived by Moses who would have been quite good at carving stone. He did, after all, come from Egypt where most of the stone carvings from the time originate. He would have had plenty of time, even according to the Bible, to obtain and create these tablets. Where is evidence for God's hand in any of this?\n\n \n Of course Db, Moses is a scam artist now, rather than one of Israel's great Patriarchs. And he duped a whole generation of Jews to follow him for 40 years in the wilderness. And don't forget the fire which led them by night and the smoke which led them by day, and let's not forget the manna which fell from heaven to feed them. And let's not forget about when he struck a rock with his Rod and water flowed from it. That Moses was such a trickster Db. The 10 commandments were the least of Gods miracles through him sonny boy. And you obviously have no idea what his life represented for you to have made such a shallow and ignorant statement.\n \n \nHaven't many of the accounts and interpretations of the Bible been COMPLETELY disproven? The Earth is not the center of the universe. The Earth is not flat. The Earth is older than the Bible claims (not just creation accounts). etc etc\n\n \n No, in fact just the opposite is true. Here again, educate yourself: Archeological evidence regarding the Bible\n \n \nHistory and the Bible do not always agree. Accounts of historical events from other civilizations often contain similar stories, and it is easy to speculate they have common origins, but often the Bible is not consistent with older accounts of the same events.\n\n \n More generalizations and unsupported claims without even one bit of actual evidence. Rather than posting meaningless opinions, give me something to respond to, ok?\n \n \n I'm not exactly the most knowledgeable of the details of the Bible (I consider it historical myth), but I do know the basics. I'm sure your defense will in part be to pick apart these statements looking for discrepancies. You will probably ask for specifics, knowing full well what they are or at least what I'm referring to. So, can you you offer any proof that anything I have stated above is not true?\n\n \n I have offered proof refuting the specific claims you have raised here. But when you say you're not exactly knowledgeable about the bible, that's an understatement. Be specific and I will too.",

You know, instead of having the us against them attitude which they profoundly represent in such a condescending fashion in every page they write? \n \n They are no different than Hanoi Jane in their stated agenda to oppose, dismantle, demoralize and if possible defeat everyone who opposes evolution in the court of public opinion.

I doubt that the opposing pro-evolution powers that be would create any site just to stand against lil ole me. No tq, they exist to stand against a complete school of thought which legitimately interprets the available observations we all make differently than your secular humanist interpretation allows for. Here is a list which T.O. calls \"Creationist Claims\" which they state before spewing their propaganda.

That in a nut shell is what the evolution community represents in reality. You see, it doesn't matter how many advocates you dig up to support your myth of evolution, it will never succeed in erasing the living God from truly existing and having created all life as we know it, in reality. \n \n Here is an example of the crux of the circular reasoning T.O. represents. This link goes to the claim of Darwin's racism: CA005.1: Darwin's racism Notice how it links not to Darwin's book ever, to show the original referred to quotes, which the claims are based upon, but links back to other T.O. pages in a circular pattern which never gets you out of T.O. into any real objective scientific sources which supports their defense in any real or significant way. \n \n Every time I have attempted to use T.O. in order to trace back to the actual roots of the so called evidence they are proposing, I have found myself in this endless loop of self supporting propaganda. But never have I been able to go deeper into scientific understanding which is founded in actual evidence. It is a smoke screen of shallow justifications which are self serving and bogus at their core. And what is truly scary is that you believers in T.O. are so dumbed down that you can't even recognize what this promoter and defender of a pseudo scientific fraud represents in reality. \n \n And I challenge you to confront and disprove what I am pointing out here by linking to a claim above and showing that it links to hard and fast evidence within its explanation of the question being investigated.\n \n And since you obviously missed the point of my prior post, I repeat it for your edification. emoticon_xgood\n \n \nI don't reject evidence at all.

This does not improve your position, not at all. At that level of ontology, NOTHING can be proven. Any world phenomenon, whatever it may indicate, can be an illusion of the almighty Yehova. Of course, even a visible, proven, experienced Yehova can be an illusion created by Allah! Which can in turn be an illusion of another god, and so on ad infinitum.\n \n At this level of \"anything is possible\", there is no point of discussing. To have a meaningful discussion, you have to fall back to more \"known\" areas, where you find that you have to start going by evidence. You could compare it to a jury - it has to be \"beyond a reasonable doubt\", not absolutely certain. Absolute certainty is impossible to achieve.\n \n And at this point, sorry to say, evolution, or rather, the whole group of sciences that analyze the past, starts to overwhelm. Observable phenomena are observed, the traces they leave are sought for in the available traces of the old, and you wind up with evolution.\n \n You can argue that the biblical flood caused ALL the alluvial layers all over the planet. But that would be a seriously major event, and would, honestly, require magically creating a massive amout of water. An event that would have had to leave OTHER traces - traces we have not found. On the other hand, we DO observe how alluvial layers are formed right now, and if we extrapolate from those processes, we see a simply older earth that fits together. Or rather, we observe what fits together and try to come up with an explanation of why it is so.\n \n If I am honest, I'd like a serious scientist who believes in the global flood to look at the evidence and reconstruct it. DO SOME SCIENCE WITH IT. If the water left alluvial layers, where did the material come from? Where are the missing mountains that were transformed into sediments? If a massive amount of water came into being, where did the rain start? Where did the massive stresses of it create stresses in the earth crust that it should have? But I never see any of this done.\n \n No one does any actual science in religion.\n \n If there were any traces of a god, a true scientist WOULD THEN STUDY GODS. Test prayer efficiency. Test sacrifice efficiency. Can you get god to help you ace an SAT score (that's what your big student tests are called, right, over in the USA?) if you sacrifice two lambs? Three? Will 5 chickens be equal to a lamb? Could we get god to change the light speed again, so that I could possibly visit a neighbouring star system myself?\n \n The problem is that no matter how hard some people try to say that science is blind to the evidence of god, the sad truth is there are no actual indications of one. That's why science usually discounts god - because there's nothing actually pointing toward one.",

Oh yeah, \"to provide mainstream scientific responses to the many frequently asked questions (FAQs) that appear in the talk.origins newsgroup and the frequently rebutted assertions of those advocating intelligent design or other creationist pseudosciences.\"\n\n \n Here's a thought tq; what if T.O., being a legitimate source of scientific info as you assert, actually considered all interpretations of the scientific evidence on evolution with an open and objective mind and attitude as science is supposed to work? You know, instead of having the us against them attitude which they profoundly represent in such a condescending fashion in every page they write? \n \n They are no different than Hanoi Jane in their stated agenda to oppose, dismantle, demoralize and if possible defeat everyone who opposes evolution in the court of public opinion. That isn't science, it is advocacy, plain and simple.\n \n \nSo, you're basis for it being a propoganda site is that it's sole existence is to counter your falsehoods. \n\n \n My falsehoods? I doubt that the opposing pro-evolution powers that be would create any site just to stand against lil ole me. No tq, they exist to stand against a complete school of thought which legitimately interprets the available observations we all make differently than your secular humanist interpretation allows for. Here is a list which T.O. calls \"Creationist Claims\" which they state before spewing their propaganda. An Index to Creationist Claims So you see; they don't exist to promote pure science at all, the exist to oppose any and all who question their results as is obvious by their dedicated goal of attacking the opposition in a condescending way before even discussing their stated so called science.\n \n \n As for the rest of your complaint:\"Rather than just dealing with the alleged science they are supposedly discussing.\" See those little numbers throughout each and every article? And how they are connected to the little sentences at the end of each article? Those little sentences are called citations. Those citations are the exact evidence you claim that you would accept if it was presented to you.\n\n \n You mean the other allegations they contrive in order to support the lies and myths they represent? Those citations? I'm not impressed tq. You actually believe that if five people come forward and support your lie then your lie must be true. That in a nut shell is what the evolution community represents in reality. You see, it doesn't matter how many advocates you dig up to support your myth of evolution, it will never succeed in erasing the living God from truly existing and having created all life as we know it, in reality. \n \n Here is an example of the crux of the circular reasoning T.O. represents. This link goes to the claim of Darwin's racism: CA005.1: Darwin's racism Notice how it links not to Darwin's book ever, to show the original referred to quotes as evidence that creationists claims are false, which the claims are based upon, but links back to other T.O. pages in a circular pattern which never gets you out of T.O. into any real objective scientific sources which supports their defense in any real or significant way. And where are those famous citations in that example, you refer to TQ? Cuz I don't see them because the links go no where at all. Weird huh? Or is it just typical and to be expected from this fraud of a propaganda site.\n \n Every time I have attempted to use T.O. in order to trace back to the actual roots of the so called evidence they are proposing, I have found myself in this endless loop of self supporting propaganda. But never have I been able to go deeper into scientific understanding which is founded in actual evidence. It is a smoke screen of shallow justifications which are self serving and bogus at their core. And what is truly scary is that you believers in T.O. and evolution are so dumbed down that you can't even recognize what this promoter and defender of a pseudo scientific fraud represents in reality. \n \n And I challenge you to confront and disprove what I am pointing out here by linking to a claim above and showing that it links to hard and fast evidence within its explanation of the question being investigated.",

I've read quite a bit of young earth creationist literature, and I have not found any arguments to counter thermodynamics. The argument is basically as follows:\n \n YECs agree that volcanic rock was produced by volcanoes, meteor craters were produced by meteors, tectonics occurred in the past, metamorphic rock was formed in the past, etc. They argue that all these processes were simply \"speeded up\" and occurred within the last 10,000 years.\n \n But all the above processes produce heat. Trying to reduce 4.5 billion years of thermodynamic history to a 10,000 year period results in a molten earth. Since the earth is not currently molten, the YEC argument fails.\n \n The nice thing about this line of argumentation is that the energy amounts can easily be calculated and demonstrated based on 19th century physics. If you can get a YEC to engage in this line of argumentation long enough, they will either: 1. say that volcanic rock is not from volcanoes, etc.; or 2. invoke a miracle that whisked the heat away.\n \n If they go the #1 route, then they must defend against the 'God is a deceiver' argument. If they go the #2 route, then (by invoking the miraculous) they have effectively shut the science classroom door on the teaching of creationism.\n \n A similar argument can be made for YEC cosmological stories, such as Humphrey's white hole cosmology: trying to reduce a 13.7 billion year old universe into a few years produces such a concentrated amount of energy that the solar system would not exist.\n \n I have argued with many YECs and most will simply 'disappear' from this argument. Of those that stay around, they respond as above.\n",

This is actually an ability children pick up at around 4 years old.

You imbeciles have the nerve to continue to insult my intelligence and equate me to children when you are completely unable to answer my arguments. So if I'm incapable of reasoning like a child, what does that say about you mooks who are stumped by my arguments? \n \n With that said, no to the bolded above. The answer to your question is YES, if you are foolish and gullible enough to accept birdan's explanation as factual and absolute then it could create a problem. Let's go to his post.\n \n \nIf I may derail the derailment for a moment and respond to the OP .....\n \n The most effective argument I've found is heat. I've read quite a bit of young earth creationist literature, and I have not found any arguments to counter thermodynamics.

We argue that these processes were just speeded up and occurred within the last 10,000 years? Could birdan post a link that verifies that this is how creationists explain this occurrence? Or are we to take someone else's word for what we believe as you attempt to define the debate?\n \n \nBut all the above processes produce heat. Trying to reduce 4.5 billion years of thermodynamic history to a 10,000 year period results in a molten earth. Since the earth is not currently molten, the YEC argument fails.\n\n \n What I marvel at with you guys are the infantile ways that you manipulate assumptions, redefine what we believe and by attempting to fit our young earth beliefs into your accepted beliefs within the theory of evolution. In other words, Genesis says that God spoke Creation into existence in 6 days. And that the earth was void and empty, but not molten or a fire ball. I think He would have mentioned the cooling time if that was the case. So your assumptions based on fallacious conclusions fails. Not my views of what occurred. \n \n \nThe nice thing about this line of argumentation is that the energy amounts can easily be calculated and demonstrated based on 19th century physics. If you can get a YEC to engage in this line of argumentation long enough, they will either: 1. say that volcanic rock is not from volcanoes, etc.; or 2. invoke a miracle that whisked the heat away.\n\n \n Sure they can, assuming you interpret the physical evidence with the assumption you are starting with. The oft repeated problem is that you can't prove conclusively any of your molten earth assumptions which has repeatedly been proven here since you guys have admitted that you can't test or prove any of your beliefs about conditions going back 4.5 billion years ago.\n \n \nIf they go the #1 route, then they must defend against the 'God is a deceiver' argument. If they go the #2 route, then (by invoking the miraculous) they have effectively shut the science classroom door on the teaching of creationism.\n\n \n Neither route is necessary since you must first prove your molten earth scenario is a fact before submitting it for consideration. \n \n \nA similar argument can be made for YEC cosmological stories, such as Humphrey's white hole cosmology: trying to reduce a 13.7 billion year old universe into a few years produces such a concentrated amount of energy that the solar system would not exist.\n\n \n What? A 13.7 billion year old universe? That's kind of precise isn't it? My info says it's between 10 and 20 billion years old. Since it has gone from a couple of billion of years since the 19th century and increased in age every few decades ever since then, most sources say 10 to 20 billion is as close as they will come to being specific. Age of the Universe | Universe Today Here's an excerpt: \n that the universe has been here within a finite period. And because that is so, it should be possible to measure how long it has been around. So far, there are 3 major methods by which we can determine the age of the universe. Although they do not directly match, their predictions lie within the same order of magnitude; all within a range of 10 billion to 20 billion years.\n The first method, called nucleocosmochronology, is like the one mentioned above, i.e., making use of the abundances of radioactive nuclide. Another method makes use of the Universe's rate of expansion, while the 3rd through the behavior of globular clusters, which are spherical collections of stars, the oldest of which have stars estimated to be no older than 18 billion years.\n The Universe's expansion is an offshoot of the Big Bang theory, which also has led to the discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation, the source of data of the most precise measuring devices for the age of the Universe.\n The most precise measurement of the age of the Universe so far, pegged at around 13.7 billion years, was made by NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). Anisotropy pertains to the uneven distribution of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, the oldest electromagnetic waves in the Universe. With WMAP, NASA has been able to generate a full-sky map of CMB radiation and, subsequently, that said estimate. \n But getting directly to your argument, again you assume we accept that the amount of energy being assumed by you is accurate or relevant at all in reality. If God spoke the universe, the stars and all of creation into existence, then we needn't assume these conclusions are accurate at all.\n \n \nI bet he will attack the science. He's probably scouring Christian propaganda websites for the pre-written response to this notion. Maybe something like \"all the heat was condensed and used to build Hell.\"\n\n \n Not at all Db, it's just another example of us interpreting the available observations differently than you evolutionists. Nothing in the bible account agrees with the assertions regarding this excess energy which the argument claims is necessary. And the only site I posted is a secular science site which simply makes my point about how inconsistent and inconclusive your science is regarding the actual age of the universe. Three schools of thought equals 3 different ages, none of them absolute or verifiable.",

   "Well that's when creationists (legitimate scientists too) step in a redefine what a species is. Turns out, even if two breeds cannot breed successfully, they can still be considered the same species because of the gene flow between the two breeds carried by intermittent breeds. This means in order for a new species to emerge, it cannot be able to breed with ANY of the breeds that fall in between. Since a chihuahua can breed with a dachshund which can breed with a hair terrier which can breed with a collie which can breed with a Labrador which can breed with a St. Bernard, you don't really have a new species. This is reasonable, but the solution is to simply kill all the in between dogs, in which case, without changing the two species being considered at all, you have now drawn a firm line between them and created a new species. Natural evolution works like this as well. Fast changes in a species forced by changes in environment and then the rapid weeding out of the changes that are not successful. This creates gaps in the fossil record and gives creationists a good weapon to refute evolution.\n \n A jump from one species to the next can be obscure since there is always a gene flow between them though the species that existed between are now extinct. You wont see this as dramatic as with dogs since man made conditions change much faster than natural conditions. You do see the same level of changes in genes, although fewer changes in physical characteristics. \n \n This is why we still can breed any two breeds of dog through artificial insemination. There just simply hasn't been enough time for the genome to diverge and you will only see physical characteristics resulting in impossible interbreeding. In enough time, any two breeds of dog and the new breeds bred out of them, will have incompatible DNA among other dogs.",

You can watch it on Youtube by entering creationismxyz in the search field.\n \n It's a 5 star rated film.\n\n \n Here's another alleged christian who accepts the secular interpretation of the available observations at face value. Well I'm not going through another five hundred posts just to get no real answers to my queries, so here are just a few highlights from this thread, care to answer them specifically? Just click on the arrow by the posters name to go back to the original post to view the quotes being responded to.You know, for proper context and all.\n \n \n \nWhen I saw the posts that followed, I realized that attempting to correct you would just be a waste of time. So I waited till something worth responding to was posted. And accipiters post asking for scientific evidence for supernatural occurrences was sufficiently ignorant as to demand a response.\n \n Ahh, then why do you constantly insist that evolution is a reliable and tested science based on rational conclusions when you now admit that it is a theoretical branch which can never be tested or proven to be sound? Not very consistent, or even truthful of you Db.\n \n Maybe in your simple mind this is a valid opinion. But not in my mind which knows absolutely that our Sun is a literal and testable 93 million miles from earth and is as consistent as the day is long. Pun completely intended, if you can grasp it. emoticon_xgood\n \n Really? This is your definition of science? And you say we can control evolution to produce desired outcomes which support evolutions claim that macroevolution is real and simply speaking, has actually led to man evolving from fish as evolution teaches occurred in reality? Would you produce evidence of extra-species evolution which shows that one species/type/genus of animal has evolved from another species/type/genus? Forgive my redundancy, but I have learned that I must be very precise in order to not allow your side the wiggle room to purposely misrepresent what I am asking you to prove. \n \n Speaking of patterns in nature and their interpretation by both sides of this debate; this raises an argument I have repeatedly made which has been widely ignored by you in this debate, and before you appeared here, by your cohorts. And that is that we creationists don't ignore or deny any of the physical observations you evolutionists see, at all. From fossils to the layers of strata they are found in, to geology, cosmology or quantum mechanics and physics. What we do is interpret those observations differently than you do. We see the fossil record as evidence that the various layers of strata and fossils were laid down quickly, The 1993 Midwest Floods and Rapid Canyon Formation in fact rapidly which explains why they have survived intact where as we have, and I have posted time lapse film of animals being completely consumed into non existence in less than a week in the wild today. Be it by insect consumption and scavengers carrying off the remains as shown here: YouTube - Rabbit decomposition (time-lapse video) in post 123 of this thread. Here is that post so you can read my complete argument from it: http://www.4forums.com/political/366776-post123.html\n \n You evolution apologists have no response to these realities as you imagine that the ancient dead animals just laid there, never decomposing or being consumed by scavengers as the earth slowly buried them perfectly intact for us to find in the distant future. So I ask again Db, who is it that is preaching magic and outrageous fairy tales in insisting that what you preach is even the least bit rational or reasonable? \n \n Wrong again Db, my faith is not blind at all. I have personally tested and questioned every single aspect of my world view. And since we both rely on faith in holding to what we believe, I know that He whom I rely is faithful, true and trustworthy since He is real and all encompassing. You, on the other hand are placing your faith in fallen and flawed Man in accepting the man made religion of evolution which is so inconsistent and irrational as to ignore known decomposition rates as they insist that the fossil record as they define it is rational at all. emoticon_xdonno Get a clue my friend, you are not only lying to yourself, you are believing the lies and deceptions of others.\n\n \n \nWhat! You aren't interested enough to defend your own claim with evidence? Or do you already see the holes in your evidence? For example, doesn't your evidence show that all of the segregated fruit fly populations remained fruit flies at the end of the experiment? All be it flies which preferred other flies with the same diet? \n \n http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/images/evo/drosophila_experiment.gif\n \n Diane Dodd's fruit fly experiment suggests that isolating populations in different environments (e.g., with different food sources) can lead to the beginning of reproductive isolation. These results are consistent with the idea that geographic isolation is an important step of some speciation events.\n Evidence for speciation\n \n As you can see, the result of this experiment promotes the idea of reproductive isolation. The rest of the claims are nothing more than the idea that isolation might lead to some speciation events. But nothing is concluded in absolute terms at all. This just confirms the giant leaps made with little or no actual evidence upon which they are based, at all. With that said, I must ask you, in what valid science is an \"IDEA\" conclusive evidence of any absolute fact at all? emoticon_confused\n\n \n \nThe reason why we require different standards of evidence for evolution as compared to the Genesis account of Creation is because Creation is a spiritual explanation which admittedly required supernatural intervention, where as your evolution claims to be an actual science which is based upon real and verifiable evidence which claims to proves that when people like me reject your supposedly proven evidence, then that in itself is allegedly solid evidence of our ignorance. WHY? Because we are allegedly denying real and true evidence which you evos have supplied. AGAIN, I SAY ALLEGEDLY!!! Because throughout this debate your side has not only not provided any real and verifiable evidence of your supposed science, but you have run away from every valid question I have asked in regards to the massive gaps and holes which permeate its very fragile facade.\n \n Not one of you has answered why your science doesn't follow the established rules of science as outlined here: Scientific Method Uses Experiments and Controls: Good Experiments and Controls Generate Valid Scientific Conclusions | Suite101.com in spite of me asking for the 4th time now. All I get is more ignoring of my questions. Why? Because you really don't care about meeting real and true scientific standards. NONE OF YOU!!!\n \n Neither have you dealt with the undeniable FACT that the modern day conclusions you have built your complete philosophy on cannot be supported by any facts regarding what you assume, imply and assert occurred 4.5 BILLION YEARS AGO when you CLAIM original life first SPONTANEOUSLY APPEARED ON EARTH.\n \n Nor can any experiments in any lab reproduce with repeatable consistency any experiments, WITH CONTROLS, which confirm any of the claims evolution makes. Yet you all sit here and continue to insist that what you are promoting is based in FACT! Well I would like to see some actual evidence that what you claim is true today, is based on anything real that actually occurred this alleged 4.5 billion years ago. Until then, all you are spouting is an unprovable man made myth which cannot be verified by science or else you guys, and I don't mean you accipiter because you have no clue about what is even being discussed. But your cohorts would have actually answered my questions if they had answers. But they don't so the issue is moot at this point. I am wasting my time attempting to reason with people who are so blinded by the lies they have adopted, it appears useless to even try.\n\n \n \nSpeaking of magic, how do you explain the spontaneous appearance of original life on Earth this alleged 4.5 billion years ago? Oh wait, you can't explain it. Which is why you guys even theorize alien origins for the first signs of life on primordial earth via exogenesis. \n Origin of life: Alien origin taken seriously? Ghost of Francis Crick smiles wanly\n According to Matthew Hutson at Popular Mechanics, \"5 Projects Ask if Life on Earth Began as Alien Life in Space\" (December 16, 2008):\n \n For years, scientists have considered the possibility of exogenesis, the idea that life arrived on Earth from another planet, and not just the building blocks of life, but organisms that were ready to rock and roll when they arrived. It's a Rube Goldberg scenario, however, dependent on several successful steps. First, life has to evolve on an alien planet. Then it must be blasted into space on a rock, probably from a large impact. Assuming it survives a long journey through harsh conditions-and makes its way into our neighborhood-life then has to resist fiery atmospheric entry and a brutal landing before trying to make a new home for itself.\n Five projects. I wonder if the ghost of Francis Crick is their patron saint? (The double helix guy believed, controversially, that life must have come from outer space.)\n Colliding Universes: Origin of life: Alien origin taken seriously? Ghost of Francis Crick smiles wanly\n \n You remember Crick from earlier in the debate don't you? The guy who said that a 747 self constructing from the parts in a junk yard is more likely than life spontaneously appearing in a harsh and uninviting primordial earth. HERE'S MORE ON THAT SUBJECT:\n Origin of life: There must be life out there! vs. There can't be life out there!\n Robert Deyes provides a helpful summary of the see-saw between the belief that life must exist on other planets (inevitablists) and that it cannot (impossiblists):\n 'Life, Life Everywhere' was the title of a 1996 article in Scientific American that focused on the crucial question of whether the origins of life were truly an inevitable consequence of some fundamental natural tendency in the universe towards great complexity (Ref 2). From our modern stand point, it was really Fred Hoyle that challenged this 'inevitablist' school by proclaiming vehemently that, \"the emergence of a living cell from an inanimate chemical soup is about as likely as the assembly of a 747 by a whirlwind passing through a junkyard\" (Ref 2). So the modern 'improbabilist' was born, taking on the contrasting inevitabilist view in a head to head intellectual battle. While the inevitabilists used the sudden appearance of the cell almost 3.85 billion years ago (Ref 3) as evidence of life's inevitability, improbabilists such as the late Francis Crick proposed that life was unlikely to have arisen on earth and must have been seeded from outer space (Ref 2). After all if life were truly a rare phenomenon, space transportation networks would have been required to spread it around hospitable planets.\n Hmmm. The middle ground between inevitable and impossible is about as solid as the middle of a Lifesaver.Colliding Universes: Origin of life: There must be life out there! vs. There can't be life out there!\n \n SO WHAT IS IT YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT MAGIC PINFOLD? ARE YOU ACTUALLY ARGUING THAT YOUR MYTHICAL AND FALSE RELIGION OF EVOLUTION IS NOT FOUNDED IN THE BELIEF IN MAGIC?\n\n \n \nWe are approaching 500 posts on this thread and no one on your side has posted one iota of solid irrefutable evidence at all, much less huge mountains of it. If you check all of the posts from your cohorts, (and here they are: Who Posted? - 4Forums.com Political Debates and Polls) you will find that no less than 95% of all of their posts are off topic personal attacks against me which specifically and directly ignore my on topic post they are responding to, and the other 5% are personal opinions where they insist how right evo is. No facts just excuses and bluster. \n \n And God knows I have asked very specific and detailed questions yet none of them have been answered directly, specifically or scientifically at all. Just excuses as to why asking for actual evidence that the alleged 4.5 billion year foundation of spontaneous life magically appearing on earth is just mean of me and asking way too much of you poor abused evolutionists. I mean, it's only science after all. How dare I expect you to support your allegations with actual evidence which has been tested and repeated in a lab with controls which assured an honest outcome.\n \n But nooooo! you don't know the chemical makeup or anything else about the real time atmospheric, gelogical or physical conditions which existed on earth that alleged and randomly picked age of 4.5 billion years ago. Yet you want to claim mountains of evidence exists for a theory which has no proven factual foundation at all? And I'm the one relying on a sky fairy when I have the whole world with its complimentary, self sustaining and interdependent chain of life as my evidence that my world, from the single celled organisms up to we human beings were intelligently designed by a loving and personal Creator. Remember smiley, denying that God exists, or ignoring Him doesn't make Him go away or cease to exist.\n\n \n \nAnd just because having my posts ignored has become so rampant around here smiley, I thought I would repost this argument from post 475 which sent TQ scampering away.\n \n \n emoticon_ideaemoticon_idea\n \n \n Here's a thought tq; what if T.O., being a legitimate source of scientific info as you assert, actually considered all interpretations of the scientific evidence on evolution with an open and objective mind and attitude as science is supposed to work? You know, instead of having the us against them attitude which they profoundly represent in such a condescending fashion in every page they write? \n \n They are no different than Hanoi Jane in their stated agenda to oppose, dismantle, demoralize and if possible defeat everyone who opposes evolution in the court of public opinion. That isn't science, it is advocacy, plain and simple.\n \n My falsehoods? I doubt that the opposing pro-evolution powers that be would create any site just to stand against lil ole me. No tq, they exist to stand against a complete school of thought which legitimately interprets the available observations we all make differently than your secular humanist interpretation allows for. Here is a list which T.O. calls \"Creationist Claims\" which they state before spewing their propaganda. An Index to Creationist Claims So you see; they don't exist to promote pure science at all, the exist to oppose any and all who question their results as is obvious by their dedicated goal of attacking the opposition in a condescending way before even discussing their stated so called science.\n \n You mean the other allegations they contrive in order to support the lies and myths they represent? Those citations? I'm not impressed tq. You actually believe that if five people come forward and support your lie then your lie must be true. That in a nut shell is what the evolution community represents in reality. You see, it doesn't matter how many advocates you dig up to support your myth of evolution, it will never succeed in erasing the living God from truly existing and having created all life as we know it, in reality. \n \n Here is an example of the crux of the circular reasoning T.O. represents. This link goes to the claim of Darwin's racism: CA005.1: Darwin's racism Notice how it links not to Darwin's book ever, to show the original referred to quotes as evidence that creationists claims are false, which the claims are based upon, but links back to other T.O. pages in a circular pattern which never gets you out of T.O. into any real objective scientific sources which supports their defense in any real or significant way. And where are those famous citations in that example, you refer to TQ? Cuz I don't see them because the links go no where at all. Weird huh? Or is it just typical and to be expected from this fraud of a propaganda site.\n \n Every time I have attempted to use T.O. in order to trace back to the actual roots of the so called evidence they are proposing, I have found myself in this endless loop of self supporting propaganda. But never have I been able to go deeper into scientific understanding which is founded in actual evidence. It is a smoke screen of shallow justifications which are self serving and bogus at their core. And what is truly scary is that you believers in T.O. and evolution are so dumbed down that you can't even recognize what this promoter and defender of a pseudo scientific fraud represents in reality. \n \n And I challenge you to confront and disprove what I am pointing out here by linking to a claim above and showing that it links to hard and fast evidence within its explanation of the question being investigated.\n",

Because IDer usually applies to we believers in it. I mention that just for clarity since referring to Him as God is quicker and easier.\n \n Now, you are making another absolute claim here which implies that ERVs, meaning useless genetic code isn't present in all animals. You assert this alleged inconsistency and makes it appear that animals were constantly evolving and branching off into new species. But as usual, you haven't posted any evidence at all that anything you have asserted is true in any way, in reality.

I TRY to give creationists that same courtesy.\n\n \n I would, and I did which is why I am saying that useless genetic/dead end code has been found in every animal type studied in the ongoing genome project. But what is more inaccurate and deceptive, not to mention just one more example of the evolutionists ignorance is the claim in and of itself that any genetic material in any creature is JUNK DNA or useless material just because science is currently unable to explain its value to the whole gene, or to its interaction with the larger cellular system. \n \n The facts will eventually be realized by your side that what is currently undefined genetic material and therefore considered junk DNA, very specifically impacts gene transcriptions in cells which we currently see no connections between. This is why with an overall appearance that we share 96% of our DNA with chimps, it is that very junk DNA which we can't currently predict, visualize or explain that contributes to our very stark and superior differences to them, not to mention the value of the obvious 4% known genetic difference.\n \n So what can I say Db, you can't even prove that your sciences interpretation of what the genome project is learning is accurate in regards to their interpretation of the available results. Which is my whole complaint about evolution in a nutshell. Because you see, if the original premise upon which all legitimate science is based, is FALSE as it relies on the FALSE science of evolution which most assuredly is corrupted in its origins; then every single subsequent byproduct/conclusion derived from it will be corrupted, misleading and ultimately contaminated. That's why no science should ever be attempted with the goal of proving or validating evolution because that will only lead to corrupted results in the end.

   "Thanks for correcting me in my use of IDer. It makes more since to me to use it the way I did, but if its already claimed, I will say God instead.\n \n Arch, there is a distinct difference between ordinary junk DNA and ERVs. The difference is that, while ordinary junk DNA can be ascribed to genetic drift modifying into unrecognizable sequences genes that are shut off or otherwise useless (1), ERVs have a definite source within our DNA. These ERVs match exactly the sequences of DNA we find in today's retroviruses. We can also simulate the mechanism (that being a VIRUS inserting its DNA into a host's DNA), in a laboratory.

It makes more since to me to use it the way I did, but if its already claimed, I will say God instead.\n \n Arch, there is a distinct difference between ordinary junk DNA and ERVs. The difference is that, while ordinary junk DNA can be ascribed to genetic drift modifying into unrecognizable sequences genes that are shut off or otherwise useless (1), ERVs have a definite source within our DNA. These ERVs match exactly the sequences of DNA we find in today's retroviruses. We can also simulate the mechanism (that being a VIRUS inserting its DNA into a host's DNA), in a laboratory.

   "One of the recurring themes of the creationist position is that since science doesn't provide conclusive proof for anything (or for most things), then we should reject science and accept what the bible says because the bible is equally incapable of providing supporting proof, but at least with the bible you tell yourself that you will go to heaven when you die (another view incapable of bein proven). \n \n What archie and creationists in general fail to realize (or realize but pretend to deny), is that science isn't supposed to prove anything. All science does is tries to look at observable phenomena objectively, try to test reasons how these phenomena occur, and come to reasonable explanations based on these tests. Science is not a doctrine. Its a method. You can employ this method yourself and draw your own hypothses, test these hypotheses yourself, and use your own conclusions to make predictions about the phenomena. That's all there is to it. \n \n Evolution is a theory because the evidence suggests that evolution is a reasonable conclusion. Besides the events in genesis, which are not observable phenomena at all, there is no evidence that suggests that evolution is not true. And for all the evidence that casts doubt on the theory of evolution, the evidence that supports it far outweighs the counter-evidence. \n \n The reason you continually deny the validity of the scientific method on this particular issue (its actually quite hypocritical of you that you rely on the conclusions of science for over 99% of what you believe to be true) is because you begin with a foregone conclusion before you attempt to doing any testing. Because of this, it would be impossible for you to employ the scientific method. You are incapable of thinking scientifically because a prerequisite of the scientific method is objective observation, like I said above. So in order to defend your foregone conclusion you must pretend to deny the validity of the scientific method. \n \n You are going to attempt to refute this by demanding that I show proof of what I'm talking about, or evidence that supports evolution that outweighs the evidence against it. I'm going to deal with that objection in advance. I'm not going to post evidence, links, pastes or lists. This has been done exhaustively in the past on this forum, and will continue to be. More relevantly, that isn't what my post is about. I'm not arguing whether evolution is a valid conclusion or not. I'm discussing your incessant denial of the scientific method. The evidence for that is what you provide everyday here in every post you make. You have a very deep-rooted preconceived conclusion, which you regularly publish. You also assume that scientists (which you generally lump together as \"evolutionists\") also have a foregone conclusion in favor of evolution. This is a totally baseless assertion which you are incapable of supporting, and I suggest you either back up this accusation or keep your uninformed assertion to yourself. \n \n Because you inevitably must reject the scientific method, and because by necessity you must continue to pretend that you don't understand the concepts that lead to the conclusions other scientists come to, and because your own preconceived notion incapacitates you from making objective observations, then no matter how well explained and simplified the subject matter is presented, it will be always in vain.

You are confusing us just discovering that this indefinable Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) exist, with understanding why they work as they do, and why they exist at all in the order they exist in.

That is your only possible argument to debunk this as evidence for evolution, so that's what you have to do.\n\n \n You are rambling again, and speaking convoluted gibberish Db. Let me offer a metaphor which will clarify my point. Imagine that every different form of life is a different type and quality of computer designed and created by God. Where as insects have the computing power of simple calculators, the more advanced the creature, the more advanced the computing machine leading to the human being which is represented by a super computer. \n \n Now, every computer which serves to define every varied type of life on earth have many of the same components in them. It's just that those more complex life forms have more components which the simpler life forms don't have. I mean, even a calculator has a memory chip and a chip to organize its functions, not to mention a simplified yet definite motherboard. Just as a super computer does and an intermediate level computer. \n \n Well, so it is with Gods creation. Many of the same genetic components which define the lower animals also define we human beings. But what matters and counts in the end is that we are the apex of life on earth and no other creature, though by your own theory are what we evolved from which means that they were here first. Yet here we are as the ultimate life form on earth. The question is, why haven't these creatures which existed long before primates ever walked on 2 legs ever advance as we have to become higher, complex thinking creatures with imaginations and creativity as humans have. Surely they have had the time. Now I know those who preach the evolution party line will take offense to my description of evolution, and God knows they hate it when I ask common sense questions like these, but when all is said and done, humans/homo anything were the last and latest forms of life to evolve in the form of primates. So my simplified summation for the sake of time, stands and the question remains, why only human beings have the higher functions which only we possess, again just as Genesis says we were created to have?

This sequence was compared to living human mtDNA sequences and found to be outside the range of variation in modern humans. Age estimation of the Neanderthal and human divergence is four times older than the age of the common mtDNA ancestor of all living humans. The authors suggest that the Neanderthals went extinct without contribution to the present mtDNA of modern humans.\n So why again do you claim that Neanderthal is a human ancestor? And show me with genetic evidence that all of those other classifications of homos are actually our evolutionary ancestors if you can. I am just so sick of the unproven claims and insistence that you guys are right when nothing you say actually survives the most basic scrutiny of a christian who is unschooled in the sciences just as you are. \n \n And no comment regarding my beautiful metaphor regarding the computer components explaining the genetic similarities between all life forms I see. emoticon_xdonno",

Im sure now that you know the science behind it goes against your argument, you will refute the science instead of using it for your purposes as you attempted above.\n \n Neandertal DNA\n \n Also, we never believed that modern humans evolved from Neandertals. Even without DNA comparisons it was obvious that we evolved along parallel lines. I think you knew this and if you didn't, then you are ignorant to things you don't want to understand.\n \n I'm still waiting on any evidence that ERVs are not the result of retroviral insertions. I also expect you will of course show some scientific evidence which shows that the DNA we found in Neandertals does not indicate a common ancestor with modern humans.\n\n \n Here's the point I am attempting to get across to you Db; the interpretation from fossil evidence that asserts that a sub-species of human called Neanderthal interacted with early man is ludicrous and just another lie based on more self serving assumptions. The reason I know this is because all of these alleged sub species of humans were simply different types of extinct apes, and the belief that any of this took place so long ago is also just misinterpreted evolutionist propaganda. This so called science lives by the motto that if you tell a lie enough times it will become the truth. Which explains why you puppets constantly parrot the same misinformation as if they are facts.",

   "Wow Archie, that site is weak. But what else could anyone expect from you?\n \n 7.\n There are mountains on the bottom of the ocean floor (Jonah 2:5-6). Only in the last century have we discovered that there are towering mountains and deep trenches in the depths of the sea.\n \n Jonah 2:6 says: \"I went down to the moorings of the mountains; The earth with its bars [closed] behind me forever; Yet You have brought up my life from the pit, O LORD, my God.\"\n \n Odd, doesn't say anything like \"I saw mountains on the ocean floor\". Instead, it says \"I went to the moorings of the mountains\". A rational person, ie anyone not looking to try and make a book of fables seem factual, would take this as a description of depth, down to the \"roots\" of the mountains. But no one ever accused Archie of being rational.\n \n or how about this:\n \n 10.\n The Bible states that God created life according to kinds (Genesis 1:24). The fact that God distinguishes kinds, agrees with what scientists observe &#8211; namely that there are horizontal genetic boundaries beyond which life cannot vary. Life produces after its own kind. Dogs produce dogs, cats produce cats, roses produce roses. Never have we witnessed one kind changing into another kind as evolution supposes. There are truly natural limits to biological change. \n \n Typical creationist BS\n \n 11.=garbage. Read up Archie\n \n 12. Are you kidding me?\n \n 13. Apparently not. People really are that stupid\n \n 14. Yeah, let's ridicule the ToE (which we don't even attempt to comprehend), but the idea that we were made by magic out of dirt is realistically supported. How else to explain why all life is composed of elements found on this planet? :xbanghead\n \n 15. OK, now the stupidity is starting to hurt...\n \n 16. What was the water supported on? \n Where'd the light come from? He hasn't created the stars, moon or sun yet? How do you divide light from darkness? By definition, darkness is the absence of light. \n Woops, we're past the point that \"accurately express all known aspects of the creation\". Apparently, \"all known aspects of the creation\" consist of floating water and light.\n \n 18. Hate to be the one to break it to you, but a sphere is a tad different than a circle. And, while we're on Isaiah, if we're supposed to take \"circle of the earth\" to mean \"the earth is a large spheroid body\", then what are we supposed to make of the preceding verse's use of \"foundations of the earth\"? Where are these foundations Archie?\n \n 19. OK, explain to me how \"I tell you, in that night there will be two [men] in one bed: the one will be taken and the other will be left\" is \"... a clear indication of a revolving earth, with day and night occurring simultaneously\"\n \n 20. XXX? Seriously, you would consider this as support for the factual nature of the bible?\n \n 21. Diffused light does not equal seperated light. Really, this is the best you can come up with?\n \n 22. Seriously?\n \n At this point, I can feel the stupid clawing at my brain. Gah...",
