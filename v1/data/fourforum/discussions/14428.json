   "In some ways, I think it has gotten to be somewhat of a joke when it makes such news when a single judge that's likely to be turned over on appeal tries to single-handedly overturn the rule of law. It has happened many times but often doesn't hold up, and for good reason.\n \n Besides, gay pride groups are playing with fire. If it goes to the Supreme Court, there's a good chance they'll end up with an unchallengeable DOMA if/when the ruling doesn't go their way. The court is generally considered to lean conservative.",

From what I have read in the news reports, the judge did not strike down all of the federal DOMA law; the two lawsuits did not challenge the provisions of DOMA that allow states to refuse to recognize marriages performed in other states. The judge declared unconstitutional the provision of the federal DOMA law that excludes legally married same-sex couples from federal recognition and from receiving federal benefits, which is what happens now to couples married in the states where such marriage is legal.\n \n Steeeve, there is that pesky equal protection question again!

Phyllis is no longer posting by the way.\n\n \n Too bad about Phyllis. \n \n Back when you and I used to argue about the 14th amendment and the 9th amendment, I learned a lot from you and was inspired to read more and think more about these amendments. I also came to think that anyone who wants to understand constitutional interpretation has to take seriously the interpretive philosophy and approach of Justice Scalia (and others who agree with him). \n \n I continue to think that the 14th amendment changed fundamentally the role of the federal government. Specifically, the 14th made the federal government the protector of individual rights against state abrogation, which had not been its role previously. Before the 14th, the federal government had been generally viewed as the source of power that threatened liberty. With the ratification of the 14th amendment, the federal government became the protector of liberty from state power. I think if you use the \"original meaning\" approach of Justice Scalia, you come to that conclusion about the 14th (though I don't think Justice Scalia has come to that conclusion). \n \n The knotty questions about the 14th amendment continue to revolve around what specific rights the amendment protects. My reading of John Bingham suggests that he intended not only to incorporate the Bill of Rights and apply those rights to the states (through the privileges or immunities clause), but also to use federal power to protect rights not specifically enumerated in the Bill of Rights. Bingham took a broad view of the rights that he thought the constitution protects. I think Thaddeus Stevens probably had a similar view, though I need to research this. \n \n Anyhow, the equal protection clause is among the most difficult to address, because what the framers/ratifiers/rational people at the time thought it should mean is not clear from the historical evidence.",

Ha. I think it took away a lot of power from the states to try and keep them from circumventing certain legislation from the federal government. In this sense it gave the federal government more power. I think today it is interpreted as much much more than that. \n \n Did I mention anything about Justice Thomas in this post? :)\n \n \nThe knotty questions about the 14th amendment continue to revolve around what specific rights the amendment protects.

The later might be cleared up thanks to Thomas who looked like he was waiting to get that off his chest for decades. I honestly don't think Due Process could be implied to be anything more than what it was in the 5th amendment...just applied to the states. \n \n \nAnyhow, the equal protection clause is among the most difficult to address, because what the framers/ratifiers/rational people at the time thought it should mean is not clear from the historical evidence.\nI agree with this but I think Mr. Ink Blot was right when he said basically that if you don't know what it means you can't rule on it. Obviously this is not to an extreme but the EP clause seems to be pretty unclear at best....at least until Thomas \"schools\" us on that on as well.\n \n Did I mention anything about Justice Thomas in this post? :)",

   "You have become a Justice Thomas fan since you read his concurring opinion in the gun case. I honestly agree with him on this. I think that, if you go back to the \"original meaning\" of the 14th amendment, people at the time saw the privileges or immunities clause as the centerpiece of the amendment and the provision by which the federal government would protect rights. The ruling in the Slaughterhouse Cases that stripped the clause of any significance was terrible, and that ruling should not have stood for 138 years. Because of that ruling, the Court has relied on a tortured interpretation of the due process clause to incorporate the Bill of Rights selectively.",
