   "INTRO:\n \n Individual Choice has long been acknowledged as the principle that founds a society. The ancient Hebrew Texts of the old testament held that a person was reponsible for the choices that the made. Even the 10 commandments were given and enforced by the ancient jewish people. \n \n However, they did not eliminate a person's choice. It was law at that time that children were property and that the parents had the right to even terminate the life a child any time prior to them coming of age. Their society honored children though as God required it of them. Death for a child was prescribed by law as it was for an adult. It was left to the decision of the parent. \n \n The Christian religion holds that Jesus died on a cross to set the free. Free from what? Free to choose the very God they had chosen to kill. Or not to choose.\n \n Therefore, I affirm that Abortion, in a just society, would be left to the choice of the pregnant woman.\n \n Definitions: Just: I choose to define this word based on ancient greek usage of the word that is translated justified. It is a legal term. it refers to a courts declaration of innocent AND Right. In other words not only not guilty but indeed the right (or righteous) act occurred.\n \n Abortion: The termination of a pregnancy at any stage through the use of artifice.\n \n Choice: The act of determining to act. \n \n Contention 1: Not all circumstances are within the controll of the pregnant woman. \n A. Pregnant women are sometimes pregnant by choice, but not always.\n B. Those that are pregnant by choice are not always aware of the circumstances surrounding them.\n Contention II: A just society is one that values choice above other paradigms.\n A: Justice demands that one not only be innocent but right. \n B: Determining what is right is a matter of absoultes.\n C: The question becomes who determines what is absolute. There are many possibilities\n 1. Man\n 2. God\n 3. Allah\n 4. Zoroaster\n 5. etc.\n D: In order to determine what is right, one must be able to see into the heart of another. Simply making a law is not enough. That would not eliminate the necessity of choice. It would only attach consequences to that choice.\n E. A just society would not attach consequences to a choice without knowing the absolutes.\n F. Choice is valued in all religions. The Christian one in particular.\n \n Contention III: It is only necessary to prove that one instance of it being right for the pregnant woman to choose would affirm the topic as written.\n \n Case Study:\n \n A twenty four year old woman is raped and becomes pregnant. She discovers this within the first 3 weeks of the pregnancy. She is referred to a specialist by her PCP for an OB/GYN and internal medicine consults. The doctors all conclude the same thing. Should she continue this pregnancy for any longer than 3 weeks then both she and the child will die. She opts to have an abortion.\n \n Contention IV: The abortion in the case study is right. Neither would have lived if the pregnancy had continued. \n A: The choice to terminate the pregnancy or to continue is rightfully placed in the hands of the pregnant woman. If it were placed in the hands of the lawyers or even the doctors then the decision whether she lives or dies is in the hands of another without her consent. \n B: It would be wrong to choose whether or not someone else dies when they have broken no laws. She was raped and a victim, not the criminal. A just society would not impose that kind of sentencing on a non-criminal.\n C: Even the christian view would concur as would the old testament view as would the muslim view. All three of those major fundamental religions require that a person be convicted of a crime on the testimony of more than one witness to sentence them to death. There would be no such sentence in this case.\n \n Contention V: Abortion is not desirable to a just society. However, the elimination of a persons choice is abhorrant to both man and God.\n \n Threfore, One instance being proven, the concept of choice proven, I still affirm that Abortion, in a just society, would be left to the choice of the pregnant woman.",

   "\"Individual Choice has long been acknowledged as the principle that founds a society. The ancient Hebrew Texts of the old testament held that a person was reponsible for the choices that the made.\" \n \n Those choices were based on whether or not they decided to follow God and his laws, not whether or not they wanted to eliminate one of His created.\n \n \n \n \"It was law at that time that children were property and that the parents had the right to even terminate the life a child any time prior to them coming of age.\" \n \n I have no idea where you found this information. Maybe they followed man's law that they could terminate a child's life, that doesn't mean it was right. It is the law in our country right now that you can terminiate a babies life while they are in their mother's womb. That doesn't mean that it is right.\n \n \n \n \"Their society honored children though as God required it of them. Death for a child was prescribed by law as it was for an adult. It was left to the decision of the parent.\"\n \n I, to, could make a decision to kill my six-year-old son. That doesn't mean it is a moral decision. Again, what law were they following? God's law? I doubt it.\n \n \n \n \"The Christian religion holds that Jesus died on a cross to set the free. Free from what? Free to choose the very God they had chosen to kill. Or not to choose.\"\n \n Christian's believe Jesus died on the cross to set them free from an eternal death. They believe man was given free will all the way back since Adam.\n \n \n \n \"Therefore, I affirm that Abortion, in a just society, would be left to the choice of the pregnant woman.\"\n \n So, based on Christian's being able to choose whether or not they worship God, you are saying that relates to people having the choice of whether or not to have an abortion? Freedom of choice does not override freedom to live.\n Bible verses that relate to abortion:\n \n The LORD GOD makes us in the womb. Job 31:15; Isaiah 44:2, 44:24, 49:5.\n \n Did not HE (GOD) that made me in the womb make him? and did not\n One (GOD) fashion us in the womb. Job 31:15\n \n Thus saith the LORD that make thee, and formed thee \n from the womb. Isaiah 44:2\n \n Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and HE that formed \n thee from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things. Isaiah 44:24\n \n Isaiah 49:5 And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb \n to be HIS servant.\n \n Jeremiah 1:5 \"Before I formed you in your mother's womb I chose you.\n Before you were born I set you apart. I appointed you to be a \n prophet to the nations.\"\n \n Psalms 139:13 Certainly you made my kidneys, you wove me together\n in my mother's womb.\n \n 139:15 my bones were not hidden from you, when I was made in secret,\n and sewed together in the depths of the earth.\n \n 139:16 Your eyes saw me when I was a fetus. All the days ordained\n forme were recorded in your scroll before one of them came into \n existence.\n \n 1:44 For take note, when the sound of your greeting reached my ears,\n the baby in my womb leaped for joy.\n \n Exodus 21:22-24 If men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely \n but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the \n woman's husband demands and the court allows. But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise. \n \n Ps 139:15-16 My frame was not hidden from Thee, when I was made in secret, {and} skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth. Thine eyes have seen my unformed substance; and in Thy book they were all written, the days that were ordained {for me} when as yet there was not one of them. \n \n Job 10:18-19 \n 18 'Why then hast Thou brought me out of the womb? Would that I had died and \n no eye had seen me! \n 19 'I should have been as though I had not been, carried from womb to tomb.' \n \n \n \n \"Contention 1: Not all circumstances are within the controll of the pregnant woman. \n A. Pregnant women are sometimes pregnant by choice, but not always.\"\n \n Over 99% of the time they are. Anyways, for that last less-then-.0000001%, rape is an act of violence, murder is an act of violence, you don't revenge violence with worse violence.\n \n \n \n \"B. Those that are pregnant by choice are not always aware of the circumstances surrounding them.\"\n \n Those who are trying to get an abortion are not always given the right information surrounding that. In fact, it happens much more then you would think. Planned Parenthood, the largest abortion industry in the world, has had lawsuits filed against them for not providing the right information. Also for: lying, not getting permission from a parent or guardian before trying to get the girl to get an abortion, and hiding statutory rape crimes.\n \n \n \n \"Contention II: A just society is one that values choice above other paradigms.&#8221;\n \n Wrong, a just society is one that values life over all choices.\n \n \n \n &#8220; A: Justice demands that one not only be innocent but right.&#8221;\n \n An unborn baby is the most innocent thing on the planet, it has committed no wrong. Yet, according to our countries laws, it has less rights then many animals. Most liberals are out to kill it. \n \n \n \n &#8220;D: In order to determine what is right, one must be able to see into the heart of another. Simply making a law is not enough. That would not eliminate the necessity of choice. It would only attach consequences to that choice.&#8221;\n \n Exactly, you cannot stop people from murdering, but you can make them think twice about it. \n \n \n \n &#8220; E. A just society would not attach consequences to a choice without knowing the absolutes.&#8221;\n \n Murder is the one thing almost all people agree is wrong. Murder is the crime known as the &#8220;absolute wrong&#8221;. Based on what you are saying, there are no just societies. Every society bases there laws on either the people or on a combination of the people and God. Mostly it is a combination of both. Since God is an absolute, then any society that based there laws 100% on Him would be just.\n \n \n \n &#8220;F. Choice is valued in all religions. The Christian one in particular.&#8221;\n \n Yes, but God expects His people to make the right choice based on His teachings.\n \n \n \n &#8220;Case Study:\n \n A twenty four year old woman is raped and becomes pregnant. She discovers this within the first 3 weeks of the pregnancy. She is referred to a specialist by her PCP for an OB/GYN and internal medicine consults. The doctors all conclude the same thing. Should she continue this pregnancy for any longer than 3 weeks then both she and the child will die. She opts to have an abortion.&#8221;\n \n Case Study:\n A homeless woman who is a prostitute has a baby as a result of an accident. The woman needs to work in order to get food. However, since she has a baby, she has to watch it. It is impossible for her to watch her baby, and still make enough money in order for her to survive. She concludes that if she keeps the baby then she will not have enough food and she will die. She leaves the baby in a dumpster and it dies.\n \n \n \n \n &#8220;Contention IV: The abortion in the case study is right. Neither would have lived if the pregnancy had continued.&#8221; \n \n The abortion in my case study is also right. Neither would have lived if the baby had not been killed. \n \n \n \n &#8220;A: The choice to terminate the pregnancy or to continue is rightfully placed in the hands of the pregnant woman. If it were placed in the hands of the lawyers or even the doctors then the decision whether she lives or dies is in the hands of another without her consent.&#8221;\n \n The choice to live was wrongfully taken out of the fetus&#8217;s hands and placed into the mothers. The mother decided to take her babies life instead of giving up her own. Looking over at my son and his innocence, I can&#8217;t imagine life without him. I would gladly die for him.\n \n \n \n &#8220;B: It would be wrong to choose whether or not someone else dies when they have broken no laws. She was raped and a victim, not the criminal. A just society would not impose that kind of sentencing on a non-criminal.&#8221;\n \n As you said, it would be wrong to choose whether or not someone else dies when they have broken no laws. The baby inside its mother will be slaughtered without a choice. It was raped of its life and murdered like a criminal, when it was really the victim. A just society would not impose that kind of sentencing on a non-criminal. I guess we don&#8217;t live in a just society.\n \n \n \n &#8220; C: Even the christian view would concur as would the old testament view as would the muslim view.&#8221; \n \n I have already refuted you saying that the Christian and Old testament view would concur. As for the Muslim view:\n \"Losers are those who killed their children foolishly, due to their lack of knowledge, and prohibited what God has provided for them, and followed innovations attributed to God. They have gone astray, they are not guided.\" (6:140) \n \"You shall not kill any (Nafs) person - for GOD has made life\n sacred - except in the course of justice&#8230;&#8230;.\"(17:33) \n \n \"You shall not kill your children due to fear of poverty. We provide\n for them, as well as for you. Killing them is a gross offense\"(17:31) \n \n \"Say, \"Come let me tell you what your Lord has really\n prohibited for you: You shall not set up idols besides\n Him. You shall honor your parents. You shall not kill\n your children from fear of poverty - we provide for you\n and for them. You shall not commit gross sins, obvious or\n hidden. You shall not kill any (Nafs) person - GOD has made\n life sacred - except in the course of justice. These are His\n commandments to you, that you may understand.\"\n [6:151] \n \n \"Then we developed the drop into a hanging (embryo), then\n developed the hanging (embryo) into a bite-size (fetus),\n then created the bite-size (fetus) into bones, then\n covered the bones with flesh. We thus produce (Anshaa) a new\n creature. Most blessed is GOD, the best Creator.\" [23:14] \n \n \n &#8220;Contention V: Abortion is not desirable to a just society. However, the elimination of a persons choice is abhorrant to both man and God.&#8221;\n \n Sorry to use a clich\u00e9, but does that mean I have the choice to kill the man who rear-ended me in the parking lot? How about the lady who cut me off at an intersection? I think what you should have said was this: The elimination of a person is abhorrent to both man and God.\n \n \n &#8220;Threfore, One instance being proven, the concept of choice proven, I still affirm that Abortion, in a just society, would be left to the choice of the pregnant woman.&#8221;\n \n The concept of choice does not override the concept of life.",

   "am i going to get a response here?\n\n \n Well:\n \n Much of my opponents arguments are based on what occurs within the United States. I have not used the United states as an example of a just society nor would I.\n \n As for the christian view that Jesus died to \"set men free\" That is absolutely correct. That can be found in the evangelical dictionary of theology. Additionally, In Alfread Eddersheim's \"The life and Times of Jesus the Messiah\" and the writings of Josephus and in The books of leviticus and Deuteronomy and the Exodus one finds many examples of God's law declaring a person's life forfeit for Choices they have made.\n \n God's value is on the choice not on the life. Life on this earth from the christian view is temporal but there is an eternal beyond.\n \n My opponent states that 99% of abortions are simply by choice. Need a source for this. \n \n Likewise, My opponent again states that people are not always given all the information. True, but has nothing to with a Just society. A Just society does not currently exist. \n \n Again My opponent agrees with me in contention II part D. He is right we can make them think twice about it. But notice that still leaves choice. To take the choice away is to remove life. It is was torturers and rapists do. There are consequences to the choices we make. Absolutely!, But, that is not a removal of choice. \n \n I shall narrow the scope as it seems that there are only two real issues to debate. 1) The issue that in a just society the principle of choice is above that of life and 2) What is a just society.\n \n In my opponents construction he issues another case study. As the items are not parallel then they are non comparable. It is apples and oranges. Therefore, he has not refuted the case study. Its principle stands.\n \n In part F. My opponent again agrees that choice is valued in all religions and that God expects people to make the right choice. Correct. But note, he doesn't say that choice is removed it only has consequences. \n \n In part E. My opponent essentially agreed that God's laws are the absolute and that a just society would not attach consequences without knowing the absolutes. \n \n Murder is Wrong. God is Just. However, God is also merciful, kind, loving, patient. \n \n A note, Haley's handbook , josephus, and \"early biblical customs\" all point to the fact that children and women were considered property and that the husband had the right to determine life or death based on God's laws. It is in Leviticus, I believe.\n \n In any case, Choice is paramount. My opponent does have the choice to attack the man who rear-ended him. The choice has not been eliminated. It has been attached with consequences. The woman who is pregnant should have the right of choice in a just society. The society would consider the her choice paramount. Since the baby is unable to choose then it would be useful for the baby to have an advocate. \n \n Perhaps a court hearing with advocates on both sides. The choice is ultimately left to the pregnant woman but she is allowed to hear all sides. Once she has made a choice, then and only then would a judge decide if the choice was just or not.\n \n I affirm my position",

As to what you are saying, the only abortions that aren't by choice are miscarriages.\n \n \n \n \"I shall narrow the scope as it seems that there are only two real issues to debate. 1) The issue that in a just society the principle of choice is above that of life...\" \n \n I can't believe that you would find many people who believe the \"principle of choice is above that of life\". Going by that philosophy, we should have no laws of government and be able to do what you want.\n \n \n \n \"In my opponents construction he issues another case study. As the items are not parallel then they are non comparable. It is apples and oranges. Therefore, he has not refuted the case study. Its principle stands.\"\n \n I was trying to point out that the fetus was human and should indeed have all the rights of any other human. \n \n \n \n \"In part F. My opponent again agrees that choice is valued in all religions and that God expects people to make the right choice. Correct. But note, he doesn't say that choice is removed it only has consequences.\"\n \n Correct choice is valued. Not choice over life. All major religions believe that God gave us free will, that is why we can make choices. Choice is never removed because God is giving us the option of whether to love and worship him, if you don't, there will be consequences.\n \n \n \n \"A note, Haley's handbook , josephus, and \"early biblical customs\" all point to the fact that children and women were considered property and that the husband had the right to determine life or death based on God's laws. It is in Leviticus, I believe.\"\n \n I'd really like to see an exact verse here.\n \n \n \n \"In any case, Choice is paramount. My opponent does have the choice to attack the man who rear-ended him. The choice has not been eliminated. It has been attached with consequences. The woman who is pregnant should have the right of choice in a just society. The society would consider the her choice paramount. Since the baby is unable to choose then it would be useful for the baby to have an advocate.\"\n \n Some unborn babies do have advocates. There are extreme radicals who go around and kill abortion doctors, would you say that is OK?\n \n \n \n \"Perhaps a court hearing with advocates on both sides. The choice is ultimately left to the pregnant woman but she is allowed to hear all sides. Once she has made a choice, then and only then would a judge decide if the choice was just or not.\"\n \n The Judge could use his power and Choose to not allow the woman to kill her child. Also, could the woman choose to not go to the court hearing?\n \n If choice is so important, why do you believe we should take choice away? What you are trying to do is take the choice of life out of the babies hands and put it in another.\n \n Without life, there is no choice; therefore life is above choice.\n\n \n Again, it appears that choice above life or life above choice becomes the great issue of this debate. \n \n I submit the following: \n \n 1) Life without Liberty (the freedom to choose) is no life.\n 2) People died for this cause. See the american revolution. Not just by choice. Some had their lives taken from them by the enemy although they never fought. This is a natural occurrence of war.\n 3) My opponent says that there will be consequences for the choices made. True, but, the bottom line is that choice is still allowed. From a christian perspective God did not force eternal life on us. Look at the garden of eden. There were the two trees in the garden The tree of the knowledge of good and evil which god said would cause death and the tree of eternal life. God gave the choice of death and life. Note Choice. He did not force feed the tree of life. Indeed, adam and eve were driven out of the garden so that they would not then eat of the tree of life and therefore preserve their present state forever. God gave man the choice of life or death. We chose death. There are consequences, yes, but the bottom line is choice.\n 4)granted that the fetus is human but has no more rights than any other child. \n 5)My opponent states that if we valued choice above life then we would have no laws and government. Actually it is the opposite. If life was valued above choice then there would be absolute dictatorships and everyone would be isolated from everyone else. Our laws actually do not protect a persons \"life\" per se but rather their CHOICES, including their choice of life.\n 6) my opponent still provides no source for his 99%statistic. Agreed that he said 99% percent of women get pregnant by choice. What is the source?\n 7) My opponent does not argue the extreme example that I provided but rather states that life is more precious than choice. Refuted.",

   "\"1) Life without Liberty (the freedom to choose) is no life.\"\n \n I'm confused of your vague words. What is life? What is Liberty? The freedom to choose what? \n \n \"2) People died for this cause. See the american revolution. Not just by choice. Some had their lives taken from them by the enemy although they never fought. This is a natural occurrence of war.\"\n \n So, are you saying that fetuses are involved in some kind of war?

Agreed that he said 99% percent of women get pregnant by choice. What is the source?\"\n \n In the 1st Session of the 108th Congress on August 1, 2003, \"It is estimated that 25,000 to 32,000 women become pregnant each year as a result of rape or incest.\" (http://www.theorator.com/bills108/s1564.html). Columnist David Perlman wrote, \"...all 4 million women who become pregnant in America each year.\" I take this to mean that of the 4,000,000 woman who get pregnant in America each year, between 25 and 32 thousand of them are pregnant because of rape. Using simple math skills, I have concluded that, at most, .8% of woman get pregnant not by their choice.\n \n \"7) My opponent does not argue the extreme example that I provided but rather states that life is more precious than choice. Refuted.\"\n \n Are you saying that if something is incapable of choice, an advocate should make the choice for them? Then I should make the choices for my wife who is sleeping in the next room since she is incapable of choice at the moment.\n \n You've said that you believe a fetus should have the same rights as a child.

   "This is my fourth post. My opponent and I each have one more after this post of mine (I believe). ROCC- It has been enjoyable debating with you.\n \n It seems that the debate has boiled down to choice verses life. \n \n My opponent asks if we should kill our unborn children. The answer for me is no we should not. However, that is not the topic. The topic concerns whether or not the choice would be left to the pregnant woman in a just society.\n \n My opponent asks what is the purpose of the rules. Do we get the choice. The answer is yes we do. We can choose to break the rules. Consequences may be imposed by those breakages. The issue is that a just society may impose sanctions for certain actions. The choice is not removed. My opponent did not argue that fact. no one should make the choice for another. \n \n I used the example that removal of choice would lead to all people being imprisoned. My opponent did not argue this example.\n \n My opponent says it is ridiculous that I might state that an unborn child has the same rights as any other. He implies that I mean that we should kill our living children if we want. I did not say that and it does not mean that. Instead, I said the same rights. \n \n When I made the point that Hebrew children in biblical times were considered property I was attempting to explain that God himself ordained that many should die. \n \n If a just society outlaws abortion (and lets assume that a just society would) then until the woman actually has an abortion there would be no consequences. My opponent is arguing that abortion should be outlawed. The topic concerns where the choice lies. If my opponent's arguments were to hold then he would require that women be bound and locked up until they had their babies so that they could not abort them.\n \n I have never made an argument that abortion was right or wrong. I have always argued that the choice is left in the hands of the pregnant woman. My opponent has tried to argue that abortion is wrong, morally. I grant that point. However that does not remove the choice from the hands of the pregnant woman. Should a just society impose consequences for abortion, I can't honestly say.\n \n However, it would be wrong to violate the rights of a woman BEFORE she ever committed a crime.\n \n As for the issue of babies at war, my opponent missed the point. The point I was making was that liberty - freedom to choose - is more highly valued by a society that is just than even life.\n \n Life of our children - the greatest resource - No. The choices of a people are our greatest resource. Our children would not even exist if it wasn't by choice. I accept my opponents statistic for choosing to get pregnant. Note the word choice. Choice is more highly desirable.\n \n I still affirm Abortion, in a just society, would be left to the choice of the pregnant woman.\n \n Thank you and good debate",

   "ROCC-your last post doesn't count towards the debate, as the rules are a 5 aff/4 neg post count. Just letting ya know.\n \n I'm tormented over this round. E-faith, your case structure is RIDICULOUSLY abusive. I hardly think a \"choice\" is a real choice if one can be locked up for making the choice (which is what you argue when you claim that making laws prohibiting abortion can still occur in an aff world as one can still \"choose\" to abort if one is willing to go to prison). Your interpretation leaves very little negative ground, and, as a side note (not brought up in round and therefore not voted on), its based off a flawed premise, we do prohibit people from doing stuff prior to the action, its called a preliminary injunction. Its used in anti-trust law (A and B are prohibted from merging under AT law BEFORE the merger takes place), or when a petitioner can prove to a court that the action would cause him irrepairable harm. Basically, your entire argument is a topicality critique which is really unpersuasive.\n What makes this difficult is that ROCC doesn't ever answer the topicality analysis. He repeats that you should make it illegal, but doesn't respond to your hyper-technical claim that this doesn't literally negate ones choice. ROCC, if you put out even a one-liner response to this, I could have voted for you OR if you had said that we should put preliminary injunctions on people to prohibit them choosing abortions that would do it too.\n However, that only takes us half way there.\n E-faith, at this point, you've established only that the particular neg plan is non-topical. But in a values based debate, I can negate if he wins the life vs. choice debate, because it is assumed that a priori a plan will come into existance that represents a real negation (even if the neg offers a flawed one). E-faith agrees that abortion is a \"bad\" choice, but says that we value even the ability to make bad choices over life. ROCC responds that w.out life there is no choice. This arguments is a wash, which forces me to intervene to decide it (before you jump down my throat, I only intervene if the debaters give me no mechanism for weighing, which isn't present here. I was was an interventionist judge, I would have simply rejected E-faith's topicality critique and voted neg no problem). E-faith's assertion that we don't proactively limit choice is factually inaccurate (see above). His analysis of why people's choices are paramount is shaky at best (the extreme of \"pro-life\" is dictatorship, the extreme of \"pro-choice\" is anarchy). Given that, I look into what is \"substantive\" choice. Dead babies can't choose, thus, we deprieve them of both life and choice. Since E-faith concedes that we don't WANT to eliminate life, the neg has two moral harms vs. the aff's one. In an aff world, we deprieve someones life and choice to protect someone elses choice, in a neg world we deprieve someones choice to protect someone elses choice and life. Neg outweighs, thus I negate.\n \n Comments:\n E-faith: horrible case well argued, which is why i allowed your T critique to even be factored in (though to be honest, a T critique in values based debate, especially on the aff, is really tough and I dont recommend it). But don't do that again, it really was abusive. Watch for inaccurate claims (not limiting choice prior to action) and extreme examples (where everyone will die if the abortion isn't put forth)\n ROCC: READ THE OTHER PERSON'S ARGUMENTS MORE CAREFULLY! You needed to answer the Topicality analysis, it was huge. You frankly got lucky on this one. Merely restating your points isn't enough, keep the flow of debate going. That topicality analysis really could of sunk you.\n \n Sincerely,\n DSAdevil",

I still disagree but will consider it at more length. I certainly mean no disrespect. Perhaps we can discuss this more in PM just for educational purposes for me and not to try to get you to change your mind.\n \n I am uncertain as to what kind of weighting mechanism you were looking for. I am also uncertain as to what you mean by abusive. Feel free to PM responses, I do not wish to attempt to influence outcome, simply to understand.\n \n Thanks\n \n and again Thanks to ROCC, I enjoyed it none the less.",

   "I am utterly against abortion unless the pregnacy would kill the mother and the child and the only way to save the mother was to abort. If the baby would die anyway.\n I read several of the first posts and what I am hearing so far is that it is the womens \"choice\" to kill her children. Whats with that?! Doesn't the baby have any say in this? The bill of rights affect all living beings. The fetus is a living being. Therefore nobody has the \"choice\" or right to kill them or not. I don't understand why its not leagal to kill the children after they are born. There still the same person. What if a child oh say, broke thier mother's china, then could she just kill the child and nobody would stop or punish her, after all they are her children. Don't get me wrong, I belive in choice, I just believe it starts and ends in the bed.",
