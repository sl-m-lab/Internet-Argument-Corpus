   "Hello! I'm new here and I want to bring up the following issue. Did you notice American statesmen in Washington are carefully neglecting for some reason the \"hot\" matter of CIA black-site prisons in East Europe? I think if only there were an option to make up a journalist inquiry into this, we would learn a lot of intriguing facts. \n \n I know for sure, only a pitiable minority of the kept in this type of prisons are the real terrorists. All in all this \"war on terror\" is only a cover. These secret CIA prisons are mainly used to keep people unwanted by the regime of George Bush. They get taken out of the country to \"foreign US jury subsidiaries\" to undergo unallowed interrogation methods. In point of fact, these people go political prisoners trying this way or other to procure Bush impeachment and his team resignation (or at least brining to public their corrupt practice and infringement of the constitution). \n \n In America, where \"colored revolutions\" over the world are welcomed, an internal \"stars-and-stripes\" revolution is falling at hand and the regime find it necessary to tighten up a nut. As for the article in WP (CIA Holds Terror Suspects in Secret Prisons) and alike, it must be a doing of Mr. Sorros who makes no secret of his desire to be the leader of \"stars-and-stripes revolution\" in US.\n \n All are welcome to discussion. Please, feel free to let out your opinion.",

They want whoever leaked the information drawn, quartered, beheaded, and the pieces buried seperatly. Nobody seems to be suggesting an investigation of th fact the prisons exist is in order (generally a sign that it was already known on the hill), but by god they want whoever clued the public in killed and eaten.\n \n \nDo I understand you to suggest that American citizens make up a majority of the inmates in these prisons?\n\n \n Before the patriot act, this would have been laughable. Now, we have legislation that specifically allows American citizens to be secretly arrested and detained without trial, as well as it being a felony for them to ever discuss it. That being the case, I think that whetehr these are American citizens or foreign nationals is clearly up in the air. Frankly, we just don't know. Anythign without evidence is pure conjecture. Neither view is at all unreasonable.",

If not, you REALLY need to have a chat with your buddy the president and have him contact the former SOA (now WHINSEC). We taught a lot of people an awful lot of things about torture there, and the FIRST thing they learned was that you NEVER consider information gained under torture to be actionable. When you torture people, they will say just about anything to make you stop. You torture people to make them compliant, not to gain information. \n \n In fact, torturing people may actually cause them to forget information. There is a rather lengthy explanation for why this happens that I never fully grasped, but the short version is, it is a defense mechanism. Your target assumes that if you believe that they have no information, you will stop your torture. So, they forget it. It is simply no longer in their head. It is irretrievably GONE. \n \n I spent the better part of my military career teaching South American scumbags how to torture people to the point that they will admit to any crime, sign any confession, and finger anybody that you want them to. There is no way to torture people so that they provide accurate information. I have spent hours arguing this with said South American scumbags. Now I have to argue it with American scumbags. You would be surprised how many phone calls you get from politicians when the issue of torture arises and you have a background at WHINSEC.\n \n Torturing somebody is an act of desperation and retribution carried out by a coward or ordered by a cowardly regime. We are torturing people because other mans of obtaining information have failed miserably. Following the revelation of US tactics used in Iraqi prisons, intel fell off by over 80% regarding AQ activities. After Valerie Plame was ousted, making it VERY clear that the US had no problem with sacrificing the lives of foreign intelligence assets for down home political posturing, it fell to almost nothing. Most nations have stopped us in our search.\n \n So, we torture people. We know it is ineffective and they we will likely expend tens, or even hundreds of millions of dollars on wild goose chases, but we have nothing else. Bush and his band of merry men have screwed this up so badly that we can not buy information at any price and AQ has become all but impenetrable. \n \n Not so bad? Try it sometime, Buddy. That is the kind of thing that people who have never been tortured sat. Here is a simple one you can try at home, and one of the favorites of the CIA. Tape your mouth shut, and lay on your back with your head hanging over the edge of a table. Have somebody pour coke up your nose. I don't know WHY it hurts so bad, but it does. It feels like your head is exploding. A group of guys at Ft Bragg did it to a guy as an initiation/joke, and he is still in a mental hospital. That is what torture does to people. \n \n Until you have experienced it, maybe you should not pass judgment on what is bad and what is not so bad. Guys like McCain, who have been POWs and have experienced it, are probably the kind of guys that we need to be taking our cue off of regarding such things, not a state side super soldier like Bush. \n \n \nMost of these CIA prisons are filled with Al Qaeda detainees. Most Americans get angry over the torturing. Well, the Geneva convention states that torturing a group of people representing a country is not right. But see, these people are not representing a country. They are representing their political beleifs. Facism at that. They are defending a religion and their beleif of government. Al Qaeda has never controled Iraq, or Afghanistan. But, we only torture when we need information. \n\n \n That is maybe the most childish view I have ever seen on this. The Geneva convetions does not just apply to people representing a country. Teh geneva convention applies to EVERYBODY captured on the filed of battle or in an occupied country. EVERYBODY has some rigths under the Geneva convention, and the right to humane treatment is there for every single class of captured prisoner, regardless of status. \n \n \n \n-Dr. Sam Grevano\n\n \n The Universtiy of Washington Staff Directory is available online at http://www.washington.edu/home/peopledir/\n \n Here is the result for a search for your name:\n \n \nterm=Grevano lterm=Grevano\n \n No matches for Name \"Grevano\".\n\n \n Go peddle your BS elsewhere, kid. You are WAY out of your league here. If you are going to impersonate a college professor, you first need to ensure that the satff directory for that school is not online, or pick a real professor to impersonate. THEN, you need to strive to make your post coherent and intelligent sounding. The above sounds like a 15 yr old wrote it, and not an especially bright one at that.",
