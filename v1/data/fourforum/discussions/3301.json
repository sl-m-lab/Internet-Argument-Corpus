   "Well, this is not my usual haunt as I normally reside over in the Evolution vs. Creationism forum, so hello to those I'm new too emoticon_xgood \n \n Charlotte Wyatt is now 11 months old and lives in England. She was born prematurely at 26 weeks. She suffers from severe heart and lung problems, and has required resuscitation three times when her heart stopped. Her doctors feel that she will not survive infancy as a result of her health, and feel that to resuscitate again will only prolong a suffering that has an inevitable outcome.\n \n Her parents oppose this view and want every effort to be made to help Charlotte survive as she has already beaten the odds and lived so long.\n \n Because of her parents stance the Health Trust has decided it must obtain legal authority from the High Court so Charlotte can be allowed to die if she requires resuscitation again. In an unusual move, the case Judge has allowed this case to be heard in public (with restrictions) at the request of Charlottes parents.\n \n See this link for a news report: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3701492.stm\n \n I noticed the discussions going on here and thought this was quite relevant and would be of interest.\n \n So what is the right course of action in this case? Is the Trust right in its view to withhold treatment or should the parents wishes be honoured and no effort spared in the treatment offered to Charlotte?",
