   "Iraq Puts Civilian Toll at 12,000\n Insurgency Claiming About 20 People a Day\n \n By Ellen Knickmeyer\n Washington Post Foreign Service\n Friday, June 3, 2005; Page A01\n \n BAGHDAD, June 2 -- Violence in the course of the 18-month-long insurgency has claimed the lives of 12,000 Iraqis, Interior Minister Bayan Jabr said Thursday, giving the first official count for the largest category of victims of bombings, ambushes and other increasingly deadly attacks.\n \n At least 36 more Iraqi civilians, security force members and officials were killed Thursday in attacks that underscored the ruthlessness and growing randomness of much of the violence. The day's victims included 12 people killed when a suicide attacker drove a vehicle loaded with explosives into a restaurant near the northern city of Kirkuk.\n \n In Baghdad, gunmen opened fire on a market area crowded with civilians, killing nine, the Defense Ministry said.\n \n The U.S. military reported that two soldiers were killed Wednesday, by a bomb and by small-arms fire, in the western city of Ramadi.\n \n Thursday's violence demonstrated the ability of insurgents to keep up attacks despite a week-old security operation in Baghdad billed as the most aggressive yet by Iraq's new government, in office for less than two months.\n \n The checkpoints and raids that leaders have dubbed Operation Lightning have brought all roads in and out of the capital under government control, said Jabr, the minister in charge of Iraq's police forces. The actions are meant to expose insurgent hideouts in the city, he told reporters from some foreign news organizations, adding, \"Within the next few months, we can deal with all of the killings and assassinations.\"\n \n Jabr said security forces had detained 700 \"terrorists\" and killed 28 during the operation. The Defense Ministry said Wednesday that 680 people had been detained but that all but 95 had been released for lack of evidence warranting prosecution.\n \n Interior Ministry statistics showed 12,000 civilians killed by insurgents in the last year and a half, Jabr said. The figure breaks down to an average of more than 20 civilians killed by bombings and other attacks each day. Authorities estimate that more than 10,500 of the victims were Shiite Muslims, based on the locations of the deaths, Jabr said.\n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/02/AR2005060201098.html?sub=AR\n \n Flypaper is a massacre. The Iraqis are getting mowed down.",

   "Bush's Optimism On Iraq Debated\n Rosy View in Time Of Rising Violence Revives Criticism\n \n By Jim VandeHei and Peter Baker\n Washington Post Staff Writers\n Sunday, June 5, 2005; A01\n \n \n \n President Bush's portrayal of a wilting insurgency in Iraq at a time of escalating violence and insecurity throughout the country is reviving the debate over the administration's Iraq strategy and the accuracy of its upbeat claims.\n \n While Bush and Vice President Cheney offer optimistic assessments of the situation, a fresh wave of car bombings and other attacks killed 80 U.S. soldiers and more than 700 Iraqis last month alone and prompted Iraqi leaders to appeal to the administration for greater help. Privately, some administration officials have concluded the violence will not subside through this year.\n \n The disconnect between Rose Garden optimism and Baghdad pessimism, according to government officials and independent analysts, stems not only from Bush's focus on tentative signs of long-term progress but also from the shrinking range of policy options available to him if he is wrong. Having set out on a course of trying to stand up a new constitutional, elected government with the security firepower to defend itself, Bush finds himself locked into a strategy that, even if it proves successful, foreshadows many more deadly months to come first, analysts said.\n \n Military commanders in Iraq privately told a visiting congressional delegation last week that the United States is at least two years away from adequately training a viable Iraqi military but that it is no longer reasonable to consider augmenting U.S. troops already strained by the two-year operation, said Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.). \"The idea that the insurgents are on the run and we are about to turn the corner, I did not hear that from anybody,\" Biden said in an interview.\n \n Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.), who joined Biden for part of the trip, said Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and others are misleading Americans about the number of functional Iraqi troops and warned the president to pay more attention to shutting off Syrian and Iranian assistance to the insurgency. \"We don't want to raise the expectations of the American people prematurely,\" he said.\n \n After dialing down criticism of Bush's policy following the successful January elections in Iraq, congressional Democrats are increasingly challenging the president's decisions and public assessments, and developing alternative policy ideas. \"The administration has failed to level with the American people,\" said Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.). \"It's terrible because they refuse to provide a full picture of what is really happening there.\"\n \n Reid traveled to Iraq in April and was confined to heavily fortified zones in and around Baghdad and prohibited from visiting some of the most troubled areas where the insurgency is particularly strong. \"The place is in turmoil,\" he said. Since then, Reid said, he has been meeting with former Clinton administration officials in an effort to devise a new Iraq plan, including the possibility of calling for more U.S. troops and requesting additional international assistance.\n \n The White House says the focus on recent killings overshadows substantial long-term progress in Iraq, where the January elections allowed the United States to turn over more control for security to the Iraqis and set the stage for a new constitution to be written and approved this fall. Once that happens, White House officials say, a democratically elected Iraqi government protected by a better trained and equipped Iraqi military will hold off what remains of the insurgency and gradually allow U.S. forces to withdraw. Iraq's recent decision to put 40,000 troops around Baghdad, the most ambitious military move yet by the two-month-old government, proves that the U.S. plan to eventually turn over peacekeeping duties is not only viable, but working, White House officials maintain. Bush and Cheney, however, continue to decline to set deadlines for how long U.S. troops will remain.\n \n \"I am pleased that in less than a year's time, there's a democratically elected government in Iraq, there are thousands of Iraq soldiers trained and better equipped to fight for their own country [and] that our strategy is very clear,\" Bush said during a Rose Garden news conference Tuesday. Overall, he said, \"I'm pleased with the progress.\" Cheney offered an even more hopeful assessment during a CNN interview aired the night before, saying the insurgency was in its \"last throes.\"\n \n Several Republicans questioned that evaluation. \"I cannot say with any confidence that that is accurate,\" said Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), a member of the House International Relations Committee. \"I think it's impossible to know how close we are to the insurgency being overcome.\"\n \n It is not unusual for a president to put the most positive spin possible on U.S. policy, especially during a time of armed conflict when public support is crucial. But the administration's assertions about Iraq have been a source of controversy since the earliest days of the operation, from the insistence that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction to Cheney's claim of links between Iraq and al Qaeda to the rosy forecasts about how welcome U.S. troops would be.\n \n A poll conducted last month by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that only 37 percent of those surveyed approved of Bush's Iraq policy, while the number of people telling pollsters the war was not worth the cost has been rising in recent months.\n \n \"We are just paying a heavy price for mistakes made before,\" said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).\n \n \"It's dangerous when U.S. officials start to believe their own propaganda,\" said David L. Phillips, a former State Department consultant who worked on Iraq planning but quit in frustration in 2003 and has written a book called \"Losing Iraq: Inside the Postwar Reconstruction Fiasco.\" \"I have no doubt that they genuinely think that Iraq is a smashing success and a milestone in their forward freedom strategy. But if you ask Iraqis, they have a different opinion.\"\n \n Phillips added that U.S. officials keep pointing to landmarks such as the January elections as turning points but \"at no point have any of these milestones proven to be breakthroughs.\"\n \n Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari last week lobbied Cheney and others for a more assertive U.S. military approach in Iraq, as well as for more help meeting the fall deadline for writing and approving a constitution. But even that carries risks. \"Heavy-handed meddling by the Bush administration only undermines Iraq's new political leaders,\" Phillips said.\n \n Peter Khalil, a former national security policy adviser for the Coalition Provisional Authority that ruled Iraq after Hussein's fall, said the rosy views expressed by Bush and Cheney reflect tentative hopes for progress down the road rather than a focus on day-to-day events at the moment. \"They're thinking more long term when they make such optimistic remarks,\" said Khalil, now a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. \"There's some cause for optimism; however, things could turn badly very quickly.\"\n \n Major Sunni leaders recently agreed to abandon their boycott of the political process; if they can be brought into the drafting of a new constitution and subsequent elections, Khalil and others say, it would undercut the elements of the insurgency that are powered by disaffection among the once-ruling Sunni minority. To do that, Khalil said, the new Shiite-led Iraqi government has to find the right balance in terms of including former members of Hussein's Sunni-dominated Baath Party.\n \n \"If you address these issues, it's very, very difficult to see them continue on in the use of violence because they become part of that [governing] structure,\" Khalil said.\n \n A Western diplomat in Baghdad said victory would have to be won in a drawn-out struggle that will have peaks and valleys. \"We should not expect some big-bang breakthrough so that one day the insurgency ends,\" he said on the condition of anonymity. \"We should expect a long grind-it-out.\" After all, he said, \"this is the hardest thing we've done to try to rebuild a state almost from zero.\"\n \n \"If you pull back far enough,\" he added, \"you see a positive trend. . . . The negative is we've had some really spectacular car bombs, really gruesome car bombs and we've had a terrible civilian death toll. . . . The overall trend lines for the last six to seven months are better, but not so much better that we can say it's over or we won.\"\n \n McCain said Bush needs to carefully balance his reassuring statements to a troubled nation with frank talk about the arduous and unpredictable future. \"It's a long, hard struggle and very gradually maybe we are making progress,\" McCain said. \"There are tough times ahead.\"",

   "Hydra\n i'll counter your article with another\n \nIraq: Why the Insurgency Can't Win \n Amir Taheri\n \n A month after the formation of Iraq's first freely elected government, news of suicide attacks, car bombs, and kidnappings continue to dominate the headlines from Baghdad. In April and May the number of people killed in terrorist attacks rose to an average of 15 a day, compared to five for February and March.\n \n Does this mean that the insurgency has fresh wind in its sails? Are the terrorists winning, as some Western commentators suggest?\n \n The answer to both questions is no.\n \n To be sure, the insurgency still holds the tactical initiative in the sense that, within the area where it has an effective presence, it can still decide where and when to strike. Strategically, however, the insurgency is weaker now than it was a year ago. This is because the struggle for Iraq is ultimately a political one the outcome of which will not be decided by how many people each side kills but by how those killings and other acts of violence are translated into political realities.\n \n To understand this we must understand what the fight is about.\n \n On one side we have all those who want to remold Iraq into a developing democracy in which power is won and lost through elections. Last January's general election showed that the overwhelming majority of Iraqis are on this side. On the other side there are those who, for a variety of reasons, do not wish that project to succeed. Here we find the remnants of the Baath, militants, Sunni sectarians, and, to an extent often overlooked, professional criminal elements. But this fight is not about the future of Iraq alone. The success of the democratization project in Iraq could transform the whole of the Middle East, indeed the entire Muslim world. The burgeoning democratic movement inspired by the liberation of Afghanistan and Iraq is already influencing the political debate in virtually all Arab states.\n \n Thus the Iraqi insurgency and its terrorist allies, not to mention its Islamist and pan-Arab sympathizers elsewhere, have already lost the political battle because they have failed to present a clear political alternative to the democratization project.\n \n Since 2003 the insurgents and their terrorist allies have killed lots of people but are no closer to a political victory than two years ago. They resemble a man who wins a large number of tokens in a casino only to be told at the cashier's that none could be cashed.\n \n Much to the relief of Iraq's emerging leadership, the insurgency has excluded itself form the political process. Unlike other terrorist organizations that use a political fa\u00e7ade as an interface with the rest of society, the Iraqi insurgency has opted for a quixotic strategy of seeking a straight-armed victory over the US-led coalition and the new Iraqi regime. By doing so it has limited its own options and alienated a good part of the constituency that might share some of its goals.\n \n Right from the start, the political initiative has been on the side of the US-led coalition and the new emerging Iraqi political leadership, and remains there.\n \n It was the US-led coalition that took the initiative in removing Saddam Hussein to power while those who now form the insurgency either watched in amazement or ran to hide in holes.\n \n When the insurgency appeared in the summer of 2003 it based its strategy on a number of illusions. First it thought that by killing as many Americans as possible it would undermine public opinion support for the war inside the United States. When that did not happen, the insurgency tried to terrorize as many of the allies as possible into withdrawing from Iraq. But that, too, didn't produce the desired results.\n \n Next, the insurgency decided that killing members of Iraq's nascent army and police force could do the trick. But two years of brutal killings have failed to reduce the number of new recruits or slow down the training and deployment of new units.\n \n Once it had become clear that killing Americans and Iraqi Army and police recruits would not stop the march of history, the insurgency switched to the tactic of killing Iraqi Shiites at random. And once that had failed, random killing was extended to Sunni Kurds and Turcomans. With the insurgency's hope of provoking sectarian wars dashed, we are now witnessing a new phase in which even Sunni Arabs are being killed indiscriminately. The insurgents know how to kill but no longer know whom to kill. Nor do they seem to know why they are killing.\n \n By adopting an extremist posture the insurgency has forced many Iraqis who, for different reasons, resent the occupation or do not like the new government, into the position of passive onlookers. Most people are prepared to march, go on strike, practice civil disobedience, vote, or even take personal physical risks in pursuit of political goals. Some are even ready to sacrifice their lives for deeply felt convictions. We saw a demonstration of all that in Iraq's first free election last January when millions turned out to express their support for democratization. But when it comes to killing people at random, whether through car bombs or suicide attacks, only very few on the margins of humanity would be attracted. Having excluded the vast majority of the Iraqis from its field of vision, the insurgency has invested its hopes in the necessarily diminishing number of potential random killers and suicide bombers.\n \n Politics being the art of the possible, the insurgency's discourse consists of a jumble of impossibilities. It is impossible to imagine a new Iraq ruled once again by Saddam Hussein or Izzat Al-Duri, his No. 2 who is the insurgency's principal ringleader. Nor could one imagine the Palestinian-Jordanian terrorist Abu-Mussab Al-Zarqawi entering Baghdad as a victorious \"Commander of the Faithful\" to build an Arab version of the Taleban's now defunct rule in Afghanistan. Anyone with any knowledge of Iraq would know that few Iraqis would find either of those options as attractive.\n \n Paradoxically, the insurgency's supposed goal of driving the US-led coalition out of Iraq could, if realized, prove suicidal for the insurgents.\n \n In the first few months after the fall of Saddam Hussein, the insurgency might have benefited from an American retreat. At that time the insurgents, especially the remnants of the Baath paramilitary and security organizations, still had a virtual monopoly on weapons in Iraq and thus would have been in a position to regain power by killing large numbers of unarmed Shiites and Kurds as they had done on other occasions since 1968.\n \n Now, however, the \"other side\", that is to say the Shiites and the Kurds who together represent 85 percent of the population, are also armed and can fight back both through their own paramilitary organizations and the newly created army and police force.\n \n Of greater moment to the insurgency is the fact that the US-led coalition, constrained by American and international laws and conventions, cannot fight with the same degree of brutality that Al-Duri and Zarqawi regard as routine. But what if the fighting is left to Shiites, Kurds, and even some Arab Sunnis, who have a personal score to settle with Al-Duri and Zarqawi? They would certainly not be concerned about the Marques of Queensbury's rule. The Iraqi insurgency's future is dim because Al-Duri and Zarqawi are seeking total power at a time that Iraqi politics, and beyond it the politics of the greater Middle East, are being recast on the basis of power sharing and compromise. Because they want all of power they will end up having none of it. The insurgency may continue for many more months, if not years, in the area known as Jazirah (island), which accounts for about 10 percent of the Iraqi territory, plus parts of Baghdad. It may continue killing people but will not be able to stop the political process. Its history is one of a string of political failures.\n \n Over the past two years it has failed to prevent he formation of a governing council, the writing of an interim constitution, the transfer of sovereignty, the holding of local and general elections, and the creation of a new government.\n \n This year it will fail to prevent the writing of a new constitution, already being drafted, the referendum to get it approved, the holding of fresh parliamentary elections, and the formation of a new elected government in Baghdad.\n \n To paraphrase an Arabic saying, the caravan will continue its journey while the wolves howl.\n",

   "Just started looking. First hit was this. Thought it was interesting:\n \n \n \n Much is being made of voter turnout, but was it thanks to the stakes Shias and Kurds have in coming to power?\n \n \n Vote's In It For Iraq?\n \n * Iraq's voter turnout revised from 72 per cent to 60 per cent. This isn't the final figure, and could change after the counting of votes.\n \n * High voter turnout in the southern Shia and northern Kurd areas\n \n * Nearly 80 per cent of Sunnis boycotted the election. Some polling stations in Sunni areas didn't even open.\n \n * Threats of denying monthly food rations scared many into voting\n \n * At places the turnout was far in excess of registered voters\n \n \n The Iraq election is over, with a major non-election right at the centre of the country. Up north, Kurds voted for the sake of independence, even if autonomy was the more accepted word for it. Down south, the Shias did it to take what they saw as their long-denied right to power. Sunnis in Baghdad and the region around almost did not vote at all.\n \n And how many did vote? US-appointed spokesman for the Independent Electoral Commission for Iraq (IECI) Farid Ayar initially announced an estimated turnout of 72 per cent. He then backtracked to say 60 per cent-of registered voters-would be a closer estimate. By way of explanation, Ayar said his previous figure was \"just an estimate\" based on \"very rough, word-of-mouth estimates gathered informally from the field\". But even 60 per cent was not necessarily the final figure. \"Percentages and numbers come only after counting and will be announced when it's over.\" The counting is expected to end next week.\n \n Worse, the election almost remained unobserved. The United Nations and the European Union formed a panel of about 20 international observers-but based them in Amman in Jordan because Iraq was not considered safe enough for them. Instead, the administration posted about 20,000 Iraqi supporters of the US occupation as 'observers' at poll centres.\n \n Many Iraqis at polling booths said their names were recently 'marked' off on the list of a government agency that provides monthly food rations-this subtle threat, circulating for a while, proved a major goad. \"I'll vote as I can't afford to have my food ration cut,\" said Amin Hajar, 52, owner of a small auto garage in Baghdad. \"There's a rumour that if we don't vote, our ration will be stopped. And if that happens, I and my family would starve to death.\" When he picked up his monthly ration before the election, Hajar said he was forced to sign a form stating he had collected his voter registration. He believed the government would use this to track whether he votes or not. While the connection between the voting list and the ration list may just have been rumour, it clearly got people worried.\n \n In Shia-dominated areas in the south, the ballot papers were distributed at stores that hand out the monthly food ration. Several of these ration stores were attacked by resistance militants opposed to the elections. Some were burnt down, and several people handing out\n \n \n http://www.uruknet.info/?p=9483&hd=0&size=1&l=e",

   "UPDATE: Officials Back Away from Early Estimates of Iraqi Voter Turnout\n Everyone is delighted that so many Iraqis went to the polls on Sunday, but do the two turnout numbers routinely cited by the press -- 8 million and 57% -- have any basis in reality? And was the outpouring of voters in Sunni areas really \"surprisingly strong\"? \n \n By Greg Mitchell\n \n (February 02, 2005) -- Everyone, of course, is thrilled that so many Iraqis turned out to vote, in the face of threats and intimidation, on Sunday. But in hailing, and at times gushing, over the turnout, has the American media (as it did two years ago in the hyping of Saddam's WMDs) forgotten core journalistic principles in regard to fact-checking and weighing partisan assertions?\n \n It appears so. For days, the press repeated, as gospel, assertions offered by an election official that 8 million Iraqis went to the polls on Sunday, an impressive 57% turnout rate. I questioned those figures as early as last Sunday, and offered the detailed analysis below on Wednesday. Finally, on Thursday night, John F. Burns and Dexter Filkins of The New York Times reported that Iraqi election officials have quietly \"backtracked, saying that the 8 million estimate had been reached hastily on the basis of telephone reports from polling stations across the country and that the figure could change.\"\n \n Then, in Friday's paper, Burns and Filkins noted that one election commision official was \"evasive about the turnout, implying it might end up significantly lower than the initial estimate.\" They quoted this official, Safwat Radhid, exclaiming: \"Only God Almighty knows the final turnout now.\" They revealed that the announcement of a turnout number, expected to be released this weekend, has been put off for a week, due to the \"complex\" tabulation system.\n \n I'll be delighted if that figure, when it is officially announced, exceeds the dubious numbers already enshrined by much of the media. But don't be surprised if it falls a bit short. The point is: Nobody knows, and reporters and pundits should have never acted like they did know when they stated, flatly, that 8 million Iraqis voted and that this represents a turnout rate of about 57%.\n \n Carl Bialik, who writes the Numbers Guy column for Wall Street Journal Online, calls this \"a great question ... how the journalists can know these numbers -- when so many of them aren't able to venture out all over that country.\" Speaking to E&P on Wednesday, Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post -- one of the few mainstream journalists to raise questions about the turnout percentage -- referred to the \"fuzzy math\" at the heart of it.\n \n Those with long memories may recall the downward-adjusted turnout numbers that followed violence-plagued elections in South Vietnam in 1967 and in El Salvador in 1984.\n \n And one thing we now know for sure: the early media blather about a \"strong\" Sunni turnout has proven false. Adding a dose of reality, The Associated Press on Wednesday cited a Western diplomat who declared that turnout appeared to have been \"quite low\" in Iraq's vast Anbar province. Meanwhile, Carlos Valenzuela, the chief United Nations elections expert in Iraq, cautioned that forecasts for the Sunni areas were so low to begin with that even a higher-than-expected turnout would remain low.\n \n In a rare reference to an actual vote tabulation, The New York Times on Thursday reports that in the \"diverse\" city of Mosul, with 60% of the count completed, the overall turnout seems slightly above 10%, or \"somewhat more than 50,000 of Mosul's 500,000 estimated eligible voters.\"\n \n This, of course, is no minor matter: Iraq's leading Sunni Muslim clerics said Wednesday that the country's election lacked legitimacy because large numbers of Sunnis did not participate in the balloting. Sure, many of them are simply sore losers (they lost an entire country) but that doesn't make their reaction any less troublesome for Iraq's future, especially with the cleric-backed Shiite alliance apparently headed for a landslide win.\n \n Dexter Filkins of The New York Times warned Thursday that the widespread Sunni boycott \"could even lead to the failure of the constitution; under the rules drafted last year to guide the establishment of a new Iraqi state, a two-thirds 'no' vote in three provinces would send the constitution down to defeat. The Sunnis are a majority in three provinces.\"\n \n As for the overall Iraqi turnout: the more the better, but why is the press so confident in the estimates from an Iraqi commission with a clear stake in a high number?\n \n For several days now, many in the media have routinely referred to the figure of 8 million Iraqi voters, following the lead of Farid Ayar, the spokesman for the Independent Electoral Commission for Iraq. In the original press citations, what Ayar actually said (hedging his bets) was \"as many as 8 million,\" which most reports quickly translated as \"about 8 million,\" and then, inevitably, \"8 million.\" A\n Knight Ridder report was among the few that characterized this as only a guess.\n \n Curiously, the day before the election, according to press reports, Ayar had predicted that 7 to 8 million would turn out, giving him some incentive to later spot the numbers in that neighborhood.\n \n Also, one dares to ask: If the commission expected close to 8 million, and that's what happened -- and there was less violence on election day than anticipated -- why was the turnout greeted as such a surprise? Especially since U.S. and Iraqi leaders have spent months knocking the press for failing to report that the vast majority of regions in this country are safe and friendly.\n \n The percentage of turnout supplied by Ayar came to 57% (happily rounded off by many in the press to 60%). This was based on what was described as 14 million potential voters divided by those 8 million who braved the potential bullets and bombs to go to the polls.\n \n On Sunday, while hailing the millions going to the polls, I also raised questions about the 14 million eligible figure: was that registered voters, or all adults over 18, or what? Few on TV or in print seem to be quite sure, to this day.\n \n It's a big difference. Since Sunday, countless TV talking heads, such as Chris Matthews, and print pundits have compared the Iraq turnout favorably to U.S. national elections, not seeming to understand that 80%-90% of our registered voters usually turn out. The problem in our country is that so few people bother to register, bringing our overall turnout numbers way down.\n \n Howard Kurtz at least looked into the Iraqi numbers. In a Tuesday column, he observed that \"the 14 million figure is the number of registered Iraqis, while turnout is usually calculated using the number of eligible voters. The number of adults in Iraq is probably closer to 18 million,\" which would lower the turnout figure to 45% (if, indeed, the 8 million number holds up).\n \n To put it clearly: If say, for example, 50,000 residents of a city registered and 25,000 voted, that would seem like a very respectable 50% turnout, by one standard. But if the adult population of the city was 150,000, then the actual turnout of 16% would look quite different.\n \n \"Election officials concede they did not have a reliable baseline on which to calculate turnout,\" Kurtz concluded.\n \n He also quoted Democratic strategist Robert Weiner as saying: \"It's an amazing media error, a huge blunder. I'm sure the Bush administration is thrilled by this spin.\"\n \n Bloggers quickly questioned Kurtz's upgrade to 18 million, noting that the population of the country, according to many sources, is 25 million or so, and the population is heavily teenaged and younger. But other current estimates run as high as 27.1 million.\n \n The critics also hit Kurtz for not providing a source for his 18 million figure. But Kurtz told E&P on Wednseday, \"I talked to a couple of experts, one of whom was Ken Pollack, from Brookings, and also ran it by two of my reporters in Baghdad. But it is definitely an approximation, just trying to give a sense that -- the one thing everyone I consulted seems to agree on -- is that the 14 million, the baseline, is a very fuzzy figure because there was no registration.\"\n \n He said he thought it was Pollack, \"who studies this for a living,\" who pegged the adult population of Iraq at 17 or 18 million. \"Maybe he leaned more toward 18 million,\" Kurtz added. \"I don't know if this is a definitive figure but I was just trying to explain the difference between whatever that figure is and the 14 million that was so widely used by all the media as if it were everyone eligible -- which means, to me, everyone over 18. When in fact it was this concocted number about passive registration based on who got rations. The point is, it's all fuzzy math, and I was just trying to illustrate that.\"\n \n He added: \"This was my stab at just trying to tell readers the 60% figure that had been so widely touted was hardly definitive, and it may be lower.\"\n \n All credit to the brave Iraqis who did vote, and in many places they did turn out in droves. But it occurred to me, watching the moving TV images on Sunday of people standing in line outside polling places in Sunni hot spots, that maybe, as so often, the camera lied. In many embattled Sunni cities, we'd been told, many if not most polling places never opened. Wouldn't this likely cause a crush, by even a few hundred voters, at the relatively few places that did open?\n \n Not that anyone, that I know of, was asking.",

But a few Sunni formations are running, such as the Islamic Party, an offspring of the Muslim Brotherhood (275 candidates); the independent democrats of former ambassador Adnan Pachachi (70 candidates); and the Democratic National Party of Nassir Chaderchi (12 candidates). \n \n\n \n http://atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/FL24Ak03.html",

Has coordinated closely with Sunni Islamic organizations. The group was blamed by the Iraqi leaders for actions that necessitated the attack on Iran in 1980. Dawa members mostly either joined the Iranian military units or refrained from political activity altogether. Islamic Dawa Party members staged a major assassination attempt on Saddam Husayn in July of 1982, bombed the Ministry of Planning in August of 1982, and attacked Saddam Hussein's motorcade in April of 1987.

   "@LT\n \n the insusrgency has already lost\n they are merely making the transition into irrelevance, not to say they will be eliminated\n many functional states have active insurgencies still.\n \n \n @Daewoo\n \n yes, i know Dawa.\n why do you think they are trying to include sunni into the government even when the sunni did not vote proportionally. as it stand, they have much greater representation than they should by the vote.\n \n Re: islam on-line article. there is nothing there that disturbs me and i am actually pleased. i am happy they want to resist us occupation with words. i am not interested in iraq as a conquered province of the US. i'd like them as a strong partner in the region. they cannot be strong if they are a puppet. it is their country and should remain that way.\n i am fine with them being an islamic party wanting to establish an islamic state. i see the US as a christian state. whatever. better than an atheist state like the soviet union. nothing there suggest they will be extremist politically. (historically muslims states outside of Saudi Arabia's Wahabism have been tolerant. did you know that during the reign of the Ottomans more europeans elected to move into Ottoman regions than out of? and the ottomans waged a religious war against christiandom like no other muslims entities before even)\n i am actually surprise they admit to equal treatment for all islamic sects. kudos to them.\n \n Re:the State article. \n a couple of error. we do not want to impose western style anything in iraq. foolish. democracy however is not a western style. historically the muslims have been more democratic than the west. if a ruler is unfit to rule by the code of islam, the people can voice their opposition and force his resignation. the key concept is the people has the right overthrow their leaders. this is the core of all democracies, power in the people over their rulers.\n note also this passage\n \nBut Dawa is back, setting up offices around the country and recruiting members with the aim of contesting the elections America has promised. Its goal is to achieve an Islamic state through the ballot box, based on the teachings of its founder, Mohammed Baqr Sadr, who was executed by the regime in 1980, according to Abdul al Anizi, the party's Baghdad representative. Anizi was exiled in Damascus but said he frequently slipped back into Iraq to organize the party's underground cells.\n \n Sadr was one of the foremost Shiite religious thinkers of his day, and his views profoundly influenced a generation of Iraqi Shiites. He was a teacher and associate of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini during the years Khomeini spent in exile in Najaf, but his views were more moderate. He advocated rule not by clergy but by elected technocrats, backed up by a judiciary of clergymen that interprets laws in accordance with Shiite Islamic law.\n\n nothing wrong there.\n the rest of the article was conjectures, especially written in June of 2003.\n \n btw, thanks for the links. strong show on your part.\n \n \n @SteveRogers\n yeah .. uh huh ... yeah ... thought so.",
