   "Here's a good chunk of an article that came out today about Sudan.\n \n \"A study financed by the U.S. Government has confirmed widespread atrocities in the Darfur region of Sudan.\"\n You're kidding me right? We needed a study to tell us this? The purpose of this \"study\" was merely to stall for time to make it look like they (the federal government) were doing something about Sudan, so they didn't have to make an actual decision.\n \n \"The report does not explicitly address the question of whether genocide is occurring.\"\n You're telling me that not only did we commission a study to tell us something we already knew; we didn't even get the whole truth from it? Of course genocide is occurring. What else do you call 30,000 people being killed for being of a certain ethnicity?\n \"The refugees offered firsthand accounts of racially motivated attacks. In some instances, the Janjaweed (the militia, strongly tied to the Sudanese government I might add) took infants from their mothers' backs. Boys were killed by crushing or knifing. Female infants were tossed aside.\"\n \n Not only are 30,000 dead, but one million have been made homeless due to the murder, rape, and destruction of villages.\n \n \"The Sudanese government in Khartoum faces a Monday deadline imposed by the U.N. Security Council to disarm the Janjaweed and bring human rights violators to justice or face sanctions.\"\n If you are as stunned as I was go ahead and take a moment to read that last bit again. That's right. That's what it says- face sanctions.....FACE SANCTIONS?! FACE SANCTIONS?! This has got to be some sort of sick joke. Sudan is attempting to wipe out a people and we tell them they will have to face sanctions. Just imagine if we had told Hitler that if he didn't stopping killing the Jews and his other \"undesirables\" that we would stop buying Mercedes. This is weak, immoral, gutless, spineless, despicable, and wretched to say the least.\n \n The only reason I can possibly think of that our government hasn't done anything is that we (or should I say the wealthiest among us) have no vested economic interest in Sudan, which is about as deplorable as it gets.\n \n \"The hottest places in Hell are reserved for those who, in times of great moral crisis, maintain their neutrality.\"",
