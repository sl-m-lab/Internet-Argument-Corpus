   "Since it's Archie, I guess the following is necessary to prove that the christian dogma DOES have a doctrine of \"hell\" that unbelievers go to.\n \n I think he should pay extra attention to the first one, considering how often he throws insults around here.\n \n \n But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council; but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire (Matthew 5:22).\n \n Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire (Matthew 7:19).\n \n The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth (Matthew 13:41, 42).\n \n Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire (Matthew 18:8, 9).\n \n Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels (Matthew 25:41).\n \n Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched (Mark 9:44).\n \n And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame (Luke 16:24).\n \n In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of Our Lord Jesus Christ (2 Thessalonians 1:8).\n \n And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day. Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire (Jude 6, 7).\n \n The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb (Revelation 14:10).\n \n Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her (Revelation 18:8).\n \n And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone (Revelation 19:20).\n \n And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever (Revelation 20:10).\n \n And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:14, 15).\n \n But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death (Revelation 21:8).",

Here's the link: http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=297090&highlight=hell#post297090\n \n And below is the distortion. Because I was responding to obvious childs corruption of Pascals Wager which can be followed in context by following the link. \n \n \n \n Obviously you failed to comprehend the issues here.\n \n I stated this: How do evangelicals deal with the problem of Pascal's Wager? \n \n The problems of Pascal's Wager extend well beyond the wager itself, into questions of why should we listen to evanglicals who claim they have all of the answers when they clearly do not? \n \n The wager is obviously a tool for the discussion not the discussion itself.\n \n Hence why you fail, and why you will always fail.\n\n \n \nAgain you lie and distort the issue in order to twist it to your benefit. Can't you face any mistake you make honestly and face up to it like a man? Pascal's wager is a hypothetical with distinct parameters, once you go outside of those parameters then you have changed the wager to no longer be pascal's. And to say that Everyone is equally screwed after life according to the flaw tells us only that you don't understand the wager itself. \n \n Because the point of it is that if no God exists then everyone ends up experiencing annihilation, which is nothingness for you in Loma Linda. So how are they screwed? Nothingness is non existence so how can that be described as being screwed? Not existing doesn't hurt at all.\n \n The only way someone is screwed is if God exists and those who reject Him end up eternally separated from Him. They aren't then annihilated but end up in hell. That is what Pascal's Wager is. Any other distortions of it is just that a corruption of what Pascal wagered. \n\n \n Note the bolded above; I was speaking in total context of Pascal's Wager. It wasn't even a discussion about if people actually go to hell or not in reality. So what you have done is rip a post out of context that wasn't a debate at all about the theological question of heaven or hell and have accused me of making a dogmatic statement regarding someone going to hell.\n \n You are slandering me just because I come to debates from a spiritual perspective while you come at them from an atheistic/ secular humanist one. But because the spiritual can't be proven you accuse me of lying when ever you disagree with me. It is the epitome of dishonesty to treat the opposition like that just because we have different World Views.\n \n But when I respond to you cowards by promising you that you will someday learn the absolute truth in spite of your willful ignorance and hatred for anything good and right, you accuse me of threatening hell like the immature and cowardly baby you are. I am just so sick of being slandered and defamed by you hatemongers, only to have you all respond to my condemning response to you as as threats of damnation. Well I'm not threatening damnation at all foundit. \n \n I don't have the power to send anyone to hell. But I'm promising that you will most definitely learn the real truth some day. I'm promising you that your lies, condemnations, mockeries and slanders against me and the God I defend won't go unchallenged forever. The truth will be admitted by you one day, And the same promise goes for your buddies who mock and slander HIS truths also.",

   "No I didn't lie at all, because the key word was YOU as you yourself quoted above that I said to you. In the debate with child about Pascal's Wager did I tell you that YOU were going to hell? NOT AT ALL...\n\n You're seriously missing sight of the original accusation, which I am sure what you want in the first place.\n \n To repeat it...\n 1) You LIED in saying \"...you're attributing statements to me that i never made at all.\"\n You DID previously talk about what people would go to hell.\n You DID say that.\n \n 2) You LIEd in saying \"...you're attributing statements to me that i never made at all.\"\n I never claimed you said anything about me going to hell.\n \n Regarding #1, my point is that you were giddy over the idea of me going to hell.\n I NEVER claimed that you EXPLICITLY said I specifically was going to hell.\n So quit, cause all you're doing is CONTINUING to lie about what my point was.\n \n \n \nWe were in a specific debate where you accused me of threatening you will damnation.\n\n I stated you were happy over the idea of me going to hell.\n Quit trying to rephrase what the issue is.\n \n \n \nWe were in a specific debate where you accused me of threatening you will damnation. I challenged you to prove it.\n\n I challenge you to prove what you claim I accused you of.\n QUIT demanding I prove things that are not an accurate account of my claims.\n \n \n \nI wasn't challenging you to go back to every debate I have ever had on this forum, and you can't show where I have said that the unsaved will go to hell?\n\n MORE dishonesty.\n The reason I went back to that forum was regarding PROVING YOU A LIAR regarding something you said you had NEVER said.\n I PROVED that you fully held to the concept of \"hell\", along with SCRIPTURAL proof of the concept of \"hell\".\n \n And now you try to twist things all around, and pretend that when I went back TO PROVE YOU A LIAR, that somehow it was about you \"challenging me\"?\n \n It was NOT about you \"challenging\" anything.\n It was about YOU LYING and ME PROVING you lying.\n \n \n \n[B]BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU, THAT ISN'T THE QUESTION BEING DEBATED HERE. IN ORDER FOR YOU TO SUCCEED IN YOUR ASSERTION THAT I AM LYING; YOU MUST SHOW IT IN THIS THREAD: http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=11014 OTHERWISE YOUR JUST BUILDING A HOUSE OF CARDS ON SAND AND IT WONT HOLD UP.\n\n What bizarre b.s. is this?\n There is NO standard that the PROOF of your lie be in the same thread as the lie itself.\n \n You claimed you had NEVER said something.\n NEVER means EVER. Not just in the one thread.\n \n As Smiley noticed, you're trying to reframe the issue falsely.",

   "You claimed you had NEVER said something.\n NEVER means EVER. Not just in the one thread.\n\n \n NO IT DOESN'T FOUNDIT!!! I would have to deny the doctrine of hell in order to make that claim and I would never do that because I obviously believe in BOTH Heaven and Hell, and you know all that so why are you constantly lying here? And I will prove you're lying straight out and redefing the parameters of the debate dishonestly. Here is the order of our conversation. I said this:\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=306081&postcount=166 \n \n Then you said this:\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=306113&postcount=167\n \n Then I said show where I said YOU would burn in hell anywhere, here:\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=306116&postcount=168\n \n And here we are with you claiming every post i have ever written is fair play in proving your point.\n \n I guess my mistake was not mentioning, \"on this thread\" specifically. But even then your complete argument falls apart because you still haven't shown where I have said that YOU are going to hell anywhere. And let's face it foundit; even you're not really that dumb that you would think that making a specific challenge for you to support a claim made in a specific debate would possibly include every statement I have ever made in over 3600 posts on this forum. Oh, wait; that's exactly what you're doing here. So I must retract my prior statement.",

   "You claimed you had NEVER said something.\n NEVER means EVER. Not just in the one thread.\n\n \nNO IT DOESN'T FOUNDIT!!!\n\n Yes. It does.\n \n If I said \"I never ran a red light\", would that mean to you that I have never run a red light only in the city I am living in?\n If I said \"I never watch Smallville\", would that mean to you that I have never watched Smallville this month.\n \n Saying you have \"never\" done anything doesn't mean that there are automatically invisible qualifiers that YOU decide to add on later on when convenient.\n \n \n \nI would have to deny the doctrine of hell in order to make that claim and I would never do that because I obviously believe in BOTH Heaven and Hell, and you know all that so why are you constantly lying here?\n\n Archie, the REALLY stupid part of that claim is that I have REPEATEDLY asked you to explain where you think unbelievers go on judgment day.\n And you REPEATEDLY REFUSED to answer the question.\n \n You accuse me of \"lying\", but all that really boils down to is that you have created some rather absurd excuses for proclaiming my assessment of your lies as not lies.\n \n I do not lie.\n I have not lied.\n \n If you think I have lied, start a new thread and EXPLICITLY point out the lie.\n \n \n \nAnd I will prove you're lying straight out and redefing the parameters of the debate dishonestly.

The idea that I would go to hell.\n \n QUOTE ME where I said that you stated I would burn in hell.\n \n \n \nI guess my mistake was not mentioning, \"on this thread\" specifically.\n\n If you want to call it a \"mistake\", that would address one of your lies. At least you're not trying to dishonestly dodge it. And it only took you how many posts to admit it?\n But you're still not addressing your second lie.\n \n \n \nBut even then your complete argument falls apart because you still haven't shown where I have said that YOU are going to hell anywhere.\n\n To which I reply, you still haven't shown where I said that you stated I was going to hell.\n WHY should I prove something that is false to begin with?\n \n I could ask you to show where I said that you had false teeth.\n The fact that you NEVER CLAIMED that I said you had false teeth would be a defense against that.\n \n Likewise, it's imperative upon you to show where I SAID what you demand I prove.\n \n \n \nAnd let's face it foundit; even you're not really that dumb ...\n\n Too bad I can't say the same about you...\n \n \n \n...that you would think that making a specific challenge for you to support a claim made in a specific debate would possibly include every statement I have ever made in over 3600 posts on this forum.\n\n 1) WHY do you keep trying to label it as a \"challenge\"?\n You said you had NEVER said something.\n I PROVED that you HAD said that thing.\n \n You made no \"challenge\" at all, so STOP trying to obfuscate the issue by pretending you did.\n \n 2) You know Archie, in the next new thread you post in I think I'm going to say that I never called you a liar.\n Tell me the truth.\n Would you call me on it??? emoticon_frazzled \n emoticon_frazzled \n \n If you do, you prove my point and accept the mantle of LIAR, without that stupid excuse.",
