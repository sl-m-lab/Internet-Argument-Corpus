The truth is even uglier than the publicized version.\n\n Talk about painting himself into a corner ..... cut taxes by $1.8 trillion over 10 years, have a $412 billion deficit last year, have a projected '05 deficit of $427 billion, an Iraq sinkhole with no end in sight .... and make the statement that he will cut the deficit in half in five years.\n The only way our books will ever start to balance is with some large, painful spending cuts that will have to come from a Congress whose primary focus is getting reelected.\n Since we are on the subject of ugly numbers, take a peek at our trade deficit. In 1992, the trade deficit was $39 billion for the entire year. The projection for last December alone is $57 billion, and '04 is projected to over $615 billion.

I often wonder how they justify turning future generations into indentured serfdom and always realize, as you point out, they're concentrating on important matters like last night's game. Probably charged on a credit card. \n \n For ugly, combine the proposed budget deficit (way underestimated) and trade imbalance for 10% of our GNP. Add in past military deficit debt service and 2006 projected military for another trillion and and you're up to almost 20% of GDP, currently based on about $11 trillion, around 85% now generated by consumer and government transactions. To me, that's scary.",

Of course, one little hiccup here, maybe a Bin Laden attack (remember him?) and all bets are off about keeping the balls in the air. The administration has based military and homeland defense spending approval on fear and if they fail in deterring another domestic attack our economic disruption from 911 will seem minor. We'll turn into a police state. Another big question is if Bin Laden even needs to bother as we're doing such a splendid job on financially bleeding ourselves out, his primary goal.",

Our elected officials know what the general public will blindly accept and what has to be 'special'.

Just substitute \"democracy\" for \"communism\" and you can read just about any statement ever made about the domino theory and it holds with our current ideology.\n \n An interesting statement from Kerry this morning (and yes, I think the man is a bafoon). Turnout in the vietnamese elections was over 80% (83%, in fact, I looked it up to verify it). While the results of the Iraqi elections are still unclear, as are their effects, there have been shia led attacks in sadar city this week, which does not bode well for the occupation or the democratization process.\n \n Persoanlly, I seriously doubt that we will be seeing a significant reduction in domestic spending. Too many of the programs that Bush has proposed cutting are too poular.",
