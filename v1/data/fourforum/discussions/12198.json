   "SACRAMENTO, Calif. - Alliance Defense Fund allied attorneys together with ADF attorneys filed a lawsuit Wednesday on behalf of ProtectMarriage.com and the National Center for Marriage California to prevent harassment of citizens who gave as little as $100 to support Proposition 8. The lawsuit documents incidents of harassment and retaliation by opponents who have targeted Proposition 8 supporters after their identities and employers were made public by the state as required by California campaign finance law.\n \n \"Putting the names and employers of the people who supported Proposition 8 on the Internet for anyone to see has caused serious problems. No one should worry about getting a death threat because of the way he or she votes,\" said James Bopp, Jr., lead attorney for the supporters of Proposition 8. \"This lawsuit will protect the right of all people to help support causes they agree with, without having to worry about harassment or threats.\"\n ...\n \"Our laws should ensure free participation in the democratic process, and not result in compromising the free speech and association rights of guaranteed to all Americans,\" said ADF Legal Counsel Tim Chandler, who is serving as local counsel in the case. \"Citizens shouldn't have to choose between being involved in the democratic process and subjecting themselves to acts of vengeance.\"\n \n The lawsuit challenges parts of California's campaign finance laws that require people who donate as little as $100 to have personal information revealed on the Internet as unconstitutional violations of free speech. The lawsuit also challenges parts of the campaign finance laws that require reporting of donations after a proposition has been voted on as unconstitutional. ADF: ADF attorneys file suit to stop harassment of Calif. marriage amendment supporters - Alliance Defense Fund - Defending Our First Liberty\n \n I think we can all agree that illegal harassment should be prosecuted.\n \n However, boycotting is NOT illegal harassment. (Or maybe they should go check out what the AFA does...)\n Criticizing people for their support is not illegal harassment. Some of the examples of name-calling are not illegal harassment.\n \n For the other examples, Illegal harassment should be dealt with where it exists. Not just knee-jerk hiding everybody who could be criticized for anti-gay marriage support.\n The anti-gay side (e.g. AFA) is very active in exposing what they label as \"support\" for gay causes. Very active in asking for boycotts.\n In fact, there was one anti-gay organization threatening pro-gay marriage supporters with public exposure if they didn't donate to the anti-gay marriage cause as well...\n Why do I suspect that the ADF will in no way condemn these actions...",

   "I just saw this titled \"Hypocrisy!\", I think it hits the nail on the head. It was an e-mail so I'll copy and paste the text: \n \n \nYesterday, the leadership of Yes on Prop 8 filed a lawsuit in federal court to void a voter-passed proposition that requires the disclosure of information for people who donate more than $100 to a campaign. They claim their donors have been victimized for bankrolling the ban on marriage for LGBT couples.\n \n Their hypocrisy is shocking.\n \n This is the same \"leadership\" that sent menacing letters to Equality California donors and corporate sponsors, threatening to \"expose\" them if they did not make a similar donation to the Yes on 8 campaign.\n \n This is the same \"leadership\" that filed briefs in the California Supreme Court that argue that the voter-passed proposition cannot--and should not--be overturned by a court.\n \n For decades LGBT activists have stood proud, risking their jobs and safety for fighting intolerance. We've never asked for anything less than equality and now they want special rights.\n \n Is there no end to their hypocrisy?\n \n In solidarity,\n \n \n Geoff Kors\n Executive Director\n Equality California\n",

Some people who supported Proposition 8 had their homes and churches vandalized, were forced to resign their jobs, and were even threatened with violence and death.
