   "Myths\n \n 1: Gays can't have children.\n \n Truth: \n \n Together two gays cannot biologically produce a child between them. But, physiologically there is NO difference between homosexuals and heterosexuals. They are just as \"able\" to reproduce as anyone else. \n Many gays and lesbians often have children either through conventional heterosexual style sex with a partner of the opposite gender; whether from a previous romantic relationship or by purposefully having heterosexual sex solely to produce a child. \n Others still utilize the exact same methods of outside aid in having children as do heterosexuals, invetro-fertilization or sperm donation.\n \n \n 2: Lesbians and gays are causing the breakdown of the family.\n \n Truth \n Less than half of all children being raised are done so in \"traditional\" mother/father/children households. Divorce, irresponcibiliy or intentional raising of children alone are other major causes of the loss of \"traditional\" family units. \n \n 3: Gays molest children\n \n Truth Pedophiles molest children. Pedophiles rarely differenciate the sexual gender of their victims. Most pedophiles target their same gender due to availability of that specific gender child to the abuser. \n \n 4: Being gay is a choice\n \n Speculative Truth There are many arguments back and forth on this. Those who oppose the idea of sexuality being inborn or genetic have only as much or little proof as do those who support this idea. What we as informed human beings can do is ask those who are homosexual. Who better to inform others of their age of awareness of their sexual identity? \n \n \n 5: Gays can be \"cured\" of their gay-ness.\n \n TruthEx-gay ministries are just that, ministries. They are not accredited therapies at all. All major psychological organizations actually warn about the dangers of such groups because they have little to no training in psycho-therapy whatsoever as well as the real after effects of depression and self-loathing by \"converted\" gays. These groups keep no records of follow-up care, whether or not they even offer such care. They keep no records of \"sucess\" rates after conclussion of \"conversion\" by \"patients.\" \n \n 6: Gays can easily be identified by their manerisms and actions.\n \n Truth Indeed some gays and lesbians do posess stereotypical manurisms, but they are the minority. Most gays and lesbians are no more distinguishable then those who like specific foods, colors, television shows...etc. \n \n \n 7: Families with gay or lesbian parents are not \"real families.\"\n \n Truth Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered parents cook dinners, change diapers, and take time off to care for children, help with homework, negotiate TV time, drive children to soccer practice, worry about childcare, clean house, and read bedtime stories.\n \n 8: Gay men and lesbians have unstable relationships. \n \n Truth Gay men and lesbians are just as interested in finding committed, loving relationships as heterosexual individuals. A large number of gay men and lesbians can and do enjoy long stable and satisfying relationships. In fact, if the unions of same-sex couples were officially recognized by their states, their relationships would be even further protected through legal marriage which would lend itself to promoting long term, committed relationships as well as instilling the idea of responcibility towards relationships in general.",

But that does not prove they have changed their orientation only their behavior. A left-handed person who writes with their right hand hasn't change his/her handwriting orientation, only the behavior. \n A person who buys colored contact lenses hasn't changed their eye color, only the covering and thus the behavior.\n \n Social pressures were utilized as few as twenty years ago in perocial schools to force naturally left-handed students usage to right hand. It never changed the fact that those students are actually left handed.\n \n Take New Jersey Governor James McGreevey: He is a gay man. He married a woman and PRETENDED To be straight because of social presures. It never changed the fact that he is actually a gay man.\n I married a man, hoping, ironiously, that by behaving as if I were straight it would make me become straight. Guess what? It doesn't happen. I'm still a lesbian. My acceptance of that fact and my choice to stop living a lie, is not a choice in my orientation but rather a choice in my behavior. I chose to live in accordance to my NATURAL orientation.",

You may interpret something to be that, but science pretty much agrees it is hardwired and unchangeable. The only people who seem to believe differently are some hardcore christian groups who say people have changed, But there is no evidence to support that claim and plenty to say it is not possible.\n \n I agree with Jusitine, you may change who you have sex with, but it is unlikely you can change your sexual orientation.",
