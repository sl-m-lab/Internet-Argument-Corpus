   "American LaFrance - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \n \nFor those of us who are either fire buffs, or are in the fire service as a volunteer or on a paid department, you all know of this nameplate. Considered the \"Cadillac\" of fire apparatus, they were the mainstay of many departments. However, like the auto industry of the 1970s. quality became severely diminished, evident in their Pioneer II series and ALF eventually became a thing of the past, or so we thought. Freightliner bought the name and in 2005, was sold off and has restablished itself as THE premier manufacturer of fire apparatus. Perhaps the US Government and the Big Three automakers should take note??\n",

The crux of this thread is that the Big Three should take a lesson from American LaFrance and fix their own problems without government intervention.",

   "These 'bail outs' are going to come back to haunt us. We're giving companies more then they're even worth without any evidence that the money will prevent further slips. FDR's programs didn't get the US out of the great depression, WWII did. We're mortgaging our future and for what? We're going to get burnt on this, big time. We can't keep printing money and we can't keep throwing this money after bad money. \n \n We're creating unfunded mandates that will handicap our country for generations. Now they want another 'stimulus' package. Christ!",
