Granted there will be no romance and little to no sexual intimacy. But no biggie - for your argument to be valid you must not think either of those thing necessary in marriage. Right?\n\n Hey i'm all down for some getting it on with some lesbians. Do they look good? it's alright I'll totally get it on wiht some lesbians if they look alright. i'm serious don't tempt me with lesbians because you know men would love to hook up with some.\n \n Anyways here our the marriage right which is what we are talking about. Specify rights that I have that a gay man doesn't under the law.\n \n \n \n \n Legal Requirements for Marriage\n \n The legal requirements for a man and a woman to marry vary from state to state. Although there are differences between the requirements in the various states, a marriage between a man and a woman performed in one state must be recognized by every other state under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution.\n \n Some requirements set by state law can include: \n \n A marriage license issued by the county clerk or clerk of the court (along with payment of a fee). \n \n \n Both man and woman are 18 or older, or have the consent of a parent or a judge if younger. \n \n \n Proof of immunity or vaccination for certain diseases \n Many states have done away with mandatory premarital physical exams or blood tests. Some states still require for venereal diseases, and a few also test for rubella (also known as German Measles, a disease that is very dangerous to fetuses), tuberculosis, and sickle-cell anemia.\n Proof of the termination of any prior marriages by death, judgment of dissolution (divorce) or annulment.\n Where there is a valid marriage, termination of marital status is obtained through a dissolution or divorce lawsuit, which results in a judgment that returns both the man and the woman to the status of an unmarried (single) persons. \n Sufficient mental capacity (often this is determined as the ability to enter into a contract). \n Marriage requires two consenting people. If either person cannot or does not understand what it means to be married (due to mental illness, drugs, alcohol, or other factors affecting judgment), then that person does not have the capacity to consent and the marriage is not valid. \n The couple are not close blood relatives. \n Close blood relatives cannot marry, although in some states, first cousins can marry. Of the states that allow first cousins to marry, a few also require that one of the cousins no longer be able to conceive children.\n Blood test for venereal disease. \n Due to the rise in HIV and AIDS, many states now require that parties applying for a marital license must be offered an HIV test and/or must be provided with information on AIDS and tests available. Presently, no states requires a mandatory premarital HIV/AIDS test.\n Satisfaction of a waiting period from the time the marriage license is issued to the time the marriage ceremony is performed.\n Most, but not all, states require a waiting period, generally one to five days, between the time the license is issued and the time of the marriage ceremony. The purpose of the waiting period is to give a short time to cool off during which the parties can change their minds if they wish. The waiting period can be waived for good reason. For example, if the groom is arriving in the bride's town only one day before the wedding, but the state has a three-day waiting period, the waiting period probably can be waived by a judge or clerk of court.\n Twenty-six states require couples to wait a few days after applying for a marriage license before they receive the license:\n \n 1-day Waiting Period: Delaware, Illinois, South Carolina.\n \n 2-day Waiting Period: Maryland, New York.\n \n 3-day Waiting Period: Alaska, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Washington.\n \n 4-day Waiting Period: Connecticut.\n \n 5-day Waiting Period Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin.\n Performance of a marriage ceremony with witnesses and a person recognized by the state to have the authority to perform marriage ceremony (such as a priest, rabbi or a judge). \n A religious ceremony should be conducted under the customs of the religion, or, in the case of a Native American group, under the customs of the tribe. Religious ceremonies normally are conducted by religious officials, such as ministers, priests, or rabbis. Native American ceremonies may be presided over by a tribal chief or other designated official.\n \n \n Civil ceremonies usually are conducted by judges. In some states, county clerks or other government officials may conduct civil ceremonies. Contrary to some popular legends, no state authorizes ship captains to perform marriages.\n \n \n Most states require one or two witnesses to sign the marriage certificate. \n Recording of the marriage license after marriage ceremony is performed.\n The person who performs the marriage ceremony has a duty to send a copy of the marriage certificate to the county or state agency that records marriage certificates. Failure to send the marriage certificate to the appropriate agency does not necessarily nullify the marriage, but it may make proof of the marriage more difficult.\n Consummation of the marriage by the act of sexual relations (only a few states require this). \n Consumate: What is completed. A right is said to be initiate when it is not complete; when it is perfected, it is consummated.\n \n \n Consummation: The completion of a thing; such as the consummation of marriage, the consummation of a contract, and the like.\n \n \n Most states consider a couple to be married when the ceremony ends. Lack of subsequent sexual relations does not automatically affect the validity of the marriage, although in some states non-consummation could be a basis for having the marriage annulled.\n \n A marriage performed in another jurisdiction -- even overseas -- is usually valid in any state as long as the marriage was legal in the jurisdiction where it occurred.\n \n http://usmarriagelaws.com/search/united_states/legal_requirements/index.shtml",

Also if you research that is a general fact about journals.\n\n \n Except that you make no cititions of it, and you mindless refer to some nameless authority. \n \n \n\n This sin't about causation or correlation. This was about policy. Good try though and thanks for taking it out of context.\n\n \n You need to learn the defintiions of the fallacies before contesting them. \n \n [quote[\n This was to counter jake's appeal to authority to show taht theur us support from civil rights leaders against gay marraiges.\n\n \n Hence the defintion of the fallacy. \n \n \n\n NO I wasn't stating that the NAACP was not credible what my statement was that it wasn't a reflection of what people believe.\n\n \n I suggest you reread your post. You specifically said that \"They are too partisan to really have any credibility today.\" \n \n \n\n NO, again it was a policy argument declaring that they teach prop[er behavior and not being allowed tod ecide that would open the door for anythhing.\n\n \n Which is the defintion of the slippery slope, not to mention the rest of the fallacies still apply. You're contestin gthings you don;'t even understand. \n \n \n\n I was pointing out conflicting findings that is why i mention them\n\n \n Right....spin, spin, spin fallacy user. \n \n \n\n That is the argument when we are talking about a democratic government.\n\n \n Hence why the fallacy fits perfectly. The majority argument. \n \n \n\n That is your opinion. You cna't pass off your opinion as the standard of waht is fallacious and waht is not.\n\n \n Read the defintion of bad anaology, your practices fit nice. And you're still very inconsistant. \n \n \n\n In 1977, the Supreme Court declared in Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584 (1977) that applying the death penalty in rape cases was unconstitutional because the sentence was disproportionate to the crime. Coker resulted in the removal of twenty inmates -- three whites and 17 blacks -- awaiting execution on rape convictions from death rows around the country.\n \n http://justice.uaa.alaska.edu/death/history.html\n \n Enough said\n\n \n Whoops, I think I have to give you this one. However, plenty of people were exucted for rape prior to 1977. Congrads, this is the first and likely last one you;ll get out of. \n \n \n\n THa isn't outdated\n\n \n Yes it is. 450 species willfully practice homosexuality. How is that information not outdated? \n \n \n\n YOu can't call a fact a fallacy.\n\n \n What fact? You attack the sources instead of the data. That is the defintiion of posioing the wells. You don't even understand what you are contesting!\n \n \n\n They don't contradict each other. So you're making accusations that don't have any merit.\n\n \n The first one is a contriction. The second one is a contridiction of your other comments about marriage as a means of having kids. \n \n \n\n That is you opninion but don't pass it off as the standard to meet.\n\n \n Read bad anology. The other still stands uncontested.\n \n [quote]\n This is a repeat of your earlier argument, againjs the criteria for equality.\n [quote]\n \n Except the fallacy still stands\n \n \n\n WE are talking about within relationships and humans. Focus now.\n\n \n Not only humans have sex. Since we are also talking about naturakl, we must therefore bring in the natural world. \n \n \n\n I wasn't making an argument I was making an observation.\n\n \n The fallacy's definition is it's name, which is what you stated. \n \n \n\n The list goes to show your lack of comprehension of fallacies.\n\n \n Right. You've shown you know nothing about fallacie.s \n \n \n \n You agreed with me\n\n \n Fallacy? LIES!\n \n \n\n I was stating a policy argument. DEmocray makes the policy.\n\n \n A policy can still be a fallacy. \n \n \n\n That is not true\n\n \n Then why do you ignore posts that show that your arguments easily apply to straights? Why have none of your posts show that the same arguments apply to straights? \n \n \n\n I was talking a bout promiscuity not homosexuality but you made that connection not me.\n\n \n But you were linking it to homosexuality as a means for why it is bad without linking it to heterosexuality. \n \n \n\n AGain calling a fact fallacious\n\n \n Read the definition of the fallacy. FALLACY: ARGUMENT BY LAZINESS. \n \n \n\n Again you're making assumptions. i never said homosexualtiy was the only one that has this problem. You made that argument.\n\n \n The quote you said says far more then you can say here. What do you not understnad about \"So don't act gay and you won't have the problem.\" That means all straights don't have the problem which is FALSE. \n \n \n\n No I posted the article\n\n \n No you didn;t. \n \n \n\n Did I state an authority?\n\n \n \"People.\" \n \n \n\n What is natural conception? THere aren't many either.\n\n \n Vaginal insemtnation. Really, if tha tis true, why are there litterally millions of people going to fertility clinics? \n \n \n\n Again out of context and I can't remember the context it was used.\n\n \n irrevelant. Your statement in ANY context would qualify as a fallacy. \n \n \n\n obviously this was my opinion. I didn't try to pass it off as fact.\n\n \n Irrevelant. It is a known lie. \n \n \n \n This is statiscally accurate\n\n \n Except that i can find just as many sources which say your stats are wrong. \n \n \n\n no i was informing you of what reality is not telling you to believe but what is common knowledge and implied assumption.\n\n \n Which is the defintiion of the fallacy I pointed out. You don't even know what you are contesing. \n \n \n\n Uhh they aren't contradictory.\n Keep trying because you just killed your credibility and your comprehension of fallacies.\n\n \n Do you think that anyone takes you seriously after what I just showed and your pathetic argument?",
