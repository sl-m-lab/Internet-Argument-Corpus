   "the point is if you're hell-bent on causing harm, you'll find a way to do it. From suicide bombings to guns to knives. The reason we ban felons from being armed (which I don't agree with, either they're still in jail or they are considered law-abiding citizens in my book. If they're still a threat to kill, why are they free in public?), is because then if we do see them with a gun, we have a reason to arrest them. No one doubts that banning guns would slightly lower the ammount of guns in the hands of criminals. But the problem is that then the criminals who are able to get their hands on guns don't have to worry about the citizens owning guns, which is why statistically the safest places are the places that allow gun ownership. Citizens are able to protect themselves and it serves as a threat to potential criminals. The higher rate of gun ownership by criminals is far outweighed by the threat of citizens owning guns. You constantly hear stories about how shop or home owners were able to thwart a roberry attempt with a gun. What if they didn't have a gun?",

Perhaps make it a legal requirement to go to a licensed firearms dealer who at no charge to the parties other than the cost of the background check run the potential buyer through the database.

Substantial correlations were found between gun ownership and gun-related as well as total homicide and suicide rates. Widespread gun ownership has not been found to reduce the likelihood of fatal events committed with other means. Thus, people do not turn to knives and other potententially lethal weapons less often when more guns are available, but more guns usually means more victims of homicide and suicide.\"\n http://www.unicri.it/wwd/analysis/icvs/pdf_files/understanding_files/19_GUN%20OWNERSHIP.pdf",

   "My two cents on the driving/firearm correlation is to note that you have no right to drive a car. Driving has always been deemed a privilege which the state permits you to enjoy subject to whatever license and restrictions it pleases to impose upon you. If you believe (as I do) that the 2nd. Amendment recognizes an individual RKBA, then firearm ownership, possession, and use is a right. This does not mean that the RKBA cannot be restricted, but identifying it as a right rather than a privilege requires the government to meet a far more restrictive standard to justify the particular restriction. If you believe that there is no individual RKBA, then you are prepared to accept that the states possess the authority to create as restrictive a licensing scheme as they wish, including a total ban on possession of firearms. \n \n This is why the argument over whether the 2nd. Amendment recognizes an individual right is paramount. Gun owners argue for the individual RKBA interpretation in the hope that this would shelter their currently lawful possession of firearms. Gun control supporters wish the amendment to be read as supporting either no right or at best a \"collective\" state's right, because this would remove any constitutional barrier to whatever ban/restriction they propose.\n \n On the question of why governments want to ban felons from possessing firearms, the following SCOTUS case addresses that issue. I don't necessarily agree with the argument (particularly the use of the \"rationally related\" test), but it does illustrate the justification that governments advance for why they want to prohibit felons from possessing firearms:\n \n \"The firearm regulatory scheme at issue here is consonant with the concept of equal protection embodied in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment if there is \"some 'rational basis' for the statutory distinctions made . . . or . . . they 'have some relevance to the purpose for which the classification is made.'\" Marshall v. United States, 414 U.S. 417, 422 (1974), quoting from McGinnis v. Royster, 410 U.S. 263, 270 (1973), and Baxstrom v. Herold, 383 U.S. 107, 111 (1966). See Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, 97 (1979).8 [Page 66]\n \n Section 1202 (a)(1) clearly meets that test. Congress, as its expressed purpose in enacting Title VII reveals, 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1201, was concerned that the receipt and possession of a firearm by a felon constitutes a threat, among other things, to the continued and effective operation of the Government of the United States. The legislative history of the gun control laws discloses Congress' worry about the easy availability of firearms, especially to those persons who pose a threat to community peace. And Congress focused on the nexus between violent crime and the possession of a firearm by any person with a criminal record. 114 Cong. Rec. 13220 (1968) (remarks of Sen. Tydings); id., at 16298 (remarks of Rep. Pollock). Congress could rationally conclude that any felony conviction, even an allegedly invalid one, is a sufficient basis on which to prohibit the possession of a firearm. See, e.g., United States v. Ransom, 515 F.2d 885, 891-892 (CA5 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 944 (1976). This Court has recognized repeatedly that a legislature constitutionally may prohibit a convicted felon from engaging in activities far more fundamental than the possession of a firearm. See Richardson v. Ramirez, 418 U.S. 24 (1974) (disenfranchisement); De Veau v. Braisted, 363 U.S. 144 (1960) (proscription against holding office in a waterfront labor organization); Hawker v. New York, 170 U.S. 189 (1898) (prohibition against the practice of medicine).\"\n \n Lewis v. United States, 445 U.S. 55, 65-66 (1980)",

   "\"In 1993 a Swiss professor, Martin Killias, published a study of 18 countries concerning gun ownership, homicide and suicide. He in part concluded there was a weak correlation between total homicide and gun ownership. For a partial criticism of his study see Dunblane Misled where using the countries studied by Killias, these researchers found a much stronger correlation between firearm homicides and car ownership. More seriously, when the United States was included in the Killias study, a stronger correlation between total homicide and gun ownership was found. When two countries were excluded, the U.S. (high gun ownership, high murder rate) and Northern Ireland (low gun ownership, high murder rate) the correlation was marginally significant. Gary Kleck writes, \"Contrary to his claim that 'the overall correlation is not contingent upon a few countries with extreme scores on the dependent and independent variable', reanalysis of the data reveals that if one excludes only the United States from the sample there is no significant association between gun ownership and the total homicide rate.\" (Kleck, Targeting Guns: Firearms and Their Control, p 253. Walter de Gruyter, Inc. New York, 1997.) Kleck concludes that \"the homicide-guns study was not international at all, but merely reflected the unique status of the United States as a high-gun ownership/high-violence nation...Since the positive association Killias observed was entirely dependent on the U.S. case, where self-defense is a common reason for gun ownership, this supports the conclusion that the association was attributable to the impact of the homicide rates on gun levels.\"",
