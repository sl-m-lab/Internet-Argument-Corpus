   "Yep, another real estate bubble thread. It looks like the bubble is starting to weaken\n \n http://www.usnews.com/usnews/biztech/buzz/archive/buzz051117.htm\n \n http://money.cnn.com/2004/09/17/real_estate/buying_selling/money_bubble_0410/\n \n Putting lipstick on the pig:\n \n http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/23/business/bubble.php\n \n \n\"I don't believe real estate acts in any way that could be a bubble, because a bubble pops, and real estate doesn't explode overnight,\" said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of Corcoran Group, a large real estate firm in New York\n\n \n Bad news, Pamela. In the Ag bubble of th 1980's, the average price for an acre of land went from $1000 to $80 in 9 days. If that is not exploding overnight, I don't know what is. The average price bottomed out at $64 and stayed there for 7 months as the market was flooded with bank forclosures. This was productive land, land that could be used to turn a profit.\n \n http://www.sgvtribune.com/business/ci_3207418\n \n \n My only question is, do you guys think that it will be a gentle fall, or a crash? My personal thought is that we will se a replay of the stock market crash and the AG crash. Any reasonable person should have been able to look at the AG crash and recognize that it was temporary. People HAVE TO eat. Smart people BOUGHT during the crash, or tried to hold on with what they had and ride it out. Only XXXXXX who bought in at the top 1/4 of price increases really got burned, but when the market started to fall, it was absolute panic.\n \n 80% of the companies whose stock hit bottomin the tech market crash are still in business and profitable. Anyboyd with half a brain got out well before the bubble burst, made money when it finally did burst, and then did some hunting for bargains in the aftermath. Personally, I liquidated a alrge percentage of my portfolio that was made up of tech stocks I bought in the aftermath of the crash. Most of them I picked up for under $2 per share, and when I liquidated them, most were at over $100 per share.\n \n I live in kind of the armpit of kansas. We have a LOT of either free range, or ranches that run into hundreds of thousands of acres. It pays to know a little bit about cattle. There is an intersting and little know fact about cattle I would like to pass on. It has to do with stampedes. It only takes 3 cows to start a stampede. 3 start running, and all the rest follow. In fact, back int he old days when they used to herd cattle hundreds of miles, every outfit had a pair of good riflemen who rode a ways out from the herd in the front. Their job was to pick off the leaders in the event of a stampede. A stampede is serious business because the cattle will literally run themselves to death.\n \n My experience with the American public tells me they ar generally a lot like cattle. Once they start running, they go until they are dropping dead in their tracks. It seems to me that a large part of the housing bubble has been denial, namely denial to the fact that a bubble exists. I understand this, since for many their home is their biggest investment, and the thought of that investment going teats up is too terrible to fathom.\n \n What do you guys think? Defaltion or stampede?\n \n Also, this is a really interesting read regarding housing construction and GDP, though it does not account for flowthrough very well:\n \n http://www.cepr.net/publications/housing_fact_2005_07.pdf",

   "At this point, it still looks more like deflation. While one sector of our local market is beginning to sag (starter homes at $250k will do that), others are showing expansion with properties actually reducing time on the market. \n \n I'm not a member of any real estate association and unable to get national numbers on sales/default trends, so my comments are confined to our local market. A local guy keeps me updated on our surrounding area and we still aren't seeing any abnormal defaults, with the rental market remaining underutilized and under priced. About 20% of the rental market is estimated to be investors with negative cash flow waiting for capital gain status on appreciation, so they'll take the first hit.\n \n The major market here is $3-450k and buyers are primarily out of state retirees, so we won't have negative impact in that sector until resales in other states decline to a point of alarm. Oddly enough, a majority of the retirees have sold their homes up to two years ago and spent time traveling before deciding on a permanent retirement location. \n \n Our younger people were forced out of the market by appreciation two-years ago ($16/hr is a good job here). Rents remain low enough that manufactured housing can't compete for that business.\n \n The middle market of $5-800k is still very strong, again retirees. Above that is custom home territory here and rural land prices here are still far below any favored major metropolitan area. As long as what would be a $2mm+ home with privacy elsewhere can be built here for $1mm, in many instances a second home, the general economy or real estate markets won't affect that sector as those buyers aren't dependent on loan qualification ratios or equity market performance.",

With an overabundance of cheap rental property available, people who can't really justify the debt are buying homes. Most working class purchases and lower-end single-residence investments are on adjustable rates for qualifying purposes. With wage stagnation and rising rates, something has to eventually give. With 30% of net income considered prudent for housing, it won't take much of a market adjustment to make a lot of people upside down. Especially when considering the US personal savings rate is negative, signifying substantial personal debt other than housing with no reserves for that 'rainy day'.",

If that's reality then it's a harsh one.\n\n \n One in four sounds about right for a mature major metropolitan area consisting of service industry. Manhattan is below that, as is the Bronx. As a side note, national home ownership is now around 68%, far too high to sustain much more additional expansion. \n \n I left SoCal in 1986, selling a home in Topanga Canyon for a substantial gain for that era. I knew people there from 1987 through the early '90s who virtually lost their retirement because they had traded up in houses, believing that boom would never end. It did. \n \n Housing recovery and home affordability in SoCal was aided by building out, subjecting buyers to not only increased debt but serious commuting costs. According to a friend who lives in Irvine, desirability of reducing commute cost/time has actually lowered labor costs in the suburban ring surrounding LA due to a flood of people seeking jobs for just that purpose.",

They are far above rational prices in California, and the DC area in particular. A few months ago there was posted here the stats of how many new mortages were interest only mortgages. In some areas they accounted for 30+ % a few were in the 50% range. As most people who took one of these mortgages \"bought\" a house they would not have been able to afford otherwise, the \"reality\" of housing prices has gone haywire.\n \n A reasonble measure of what a house is worth is how much rent it would bring in. If the rent would not cover the mortgage and maintance, of the property then the house is probably overvalued for a rational market.

As I mentioned, most small investors in single residence dwellings being held for appreciation are rented on a negative cash flow basis, exposure no sane person should recommend. \n \n Increasing US housing prices isn't limited to irrational appreciation driven by temporary low-cost debt. Materials such as cement, steel, pipe and lumber in many cases have quadrupled in the past two years due to Chinese demand, Katrina and US inflation (in spite of a rosy picture cooked up by government). I participate in short-term loans within the construction industry and most contracts now include escalation clauses for volatile building materials in a scenario that was formerly cost calculated solely on a square foot basis.",

The problem with speculative demand is that eventually it always seems to dry up when people figure out that it is essentially fluff and good intentions, not material.\n \n I am seeing the same arguments that were made leading up to the .com crash and the ag crash being made regarding the housing bubble today. Granted people seem to be more passionate about their denial of the housing bubble than they were about the .com bubble or the ag bubble, but I thin that is largely because it is something that truly effects pretty much everbody in the nation. \n \n Now people seem to be playing the \"regional....won't happen here\" game. Bad news.....if you look at the numbers, nowhere in the country has escaped the curse. Some places are just a little more overinflated than others. \n \n As I said before, I think the only question is how the American public will handle it.

How well the mortgage industry handles this will be another determining factor. If a rumored across the board increase in credit card limits is adopted, that'll buy a few months and allow some 'no payments for two years' or other jive to keep paper profit transactions going while selling more mortgage bond packages to private and public retirement funds.

That would sustain a slower deflation.\n\n \n I think that you may have hit the nail on the head when it comes to how the mortgage industry handles it being a major issue. During the Ag crash, lenders handled is extremely poorly. They were keen to foreclose as quickly as possible on defaults and get that land back on the market before things hit bottom. The problem with that is all of a sudden you have millions of acres for sale in a market where buyers are extremely wary. This put prices through the floor.\n \n Personally, I do not have a horse in this race. I have already sold off all my real estate investments. I really only have my house and the acreage around it, some p[roductive ag land that I purchased at a rediculously low price, and a couple of commercial properties left, both of which I am using. I am happy with what I paid fro the house, regardless of future value, and my wife has made it clear that selling it is NOT an option in any event. I paid cash for it, so it does not really matter where the price goes.\n \n I do try to keep up, though, on the assumption that after the bubble bursts there will be real estate bargains to be had, and I am always keen to find a bargain, not to mention the fact that even a relatively minor deflation can have catatsrophic effects on our economy. \n \n The latest report I have from my real estate folks shows contracts down 14% nationwide and building permits down as well. Centex (one of the nations larges homebuilders) has publicly announced that they will be scaling back next year, but refuses to say how much. I have an inside source on that that says 30%, which is enough to ruin anybodies day. \n \n My RE advisor says to look for a return to late 1996 prices within the next 18 months. He is working from the fact that rent costs and home prices have traditionally gone hand in hand and is working off of current rent costs in that prediction.",

Most areas this is only a 20-30% decrease in the avlue of homes. This is significant from an economic viewpoint because so many people have refinanced in the last several years to take the ghost equity out of their homes at low interest rates.
