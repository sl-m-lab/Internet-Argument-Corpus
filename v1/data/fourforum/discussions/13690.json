Di-Aping, speaking on behalf of a 135-nation bloc of poorer countries - of which China includes itself - accused wealthier countries of trying to hoard economic resources for themselves.\n\n \n Well DUH. They are right. That is pretty much the goal. Keep the brownies in their place. We cannot have them threatening the jobs of hard working americans (or at least americans who think they work hard and vote).\n \n \nCountries with relatively healthy economies such as Brazil and China say they shouldn't have to limit their economic growth because of past emissions by the USA and Europe. Richer nations say their greenhouse gas emissions have started to drop, and most of the growth in emissions will come from poor nations starting to industrialize.\n\n \n Did the geniuses in washington really not think this would come up? I mean, if we are going to argue that past CO2 emissions are trashing the environment we should have expected that at some point when we were yelling \"you all help us fix this\" that somebody was going to point out that it was basically our mess. \n \n \nStern said China, in particular, needs to offer more ambitious targets for emissions cuts. He noted a recent study by the International Energy Agency, which said about half of growth in greenhouse gas emissions could come from China as its economy develops. Stern rejected arguments made by Di-Aping and others that the United States should pay \"reparations\" for the greenhouse gases it emitted in decades past.\n\n \n LOL talk about backfiring.",

Especially since when discussing the USA's contributions to AGW, it becomes a matter of life and death.\n \n The fact is that way back in 1970, before any international regulations existed anywhere, the USA instituted the EPA and started to regulate ourselves. Why? Because we were choking on our own smog and saw the negative health impact on our own citizens. So I admit our reasons were selfish and self serving at the time since our lakes, streams and rivers were also dying from pollution. \n \n Here is the rub though, we made the monetary investment to invent and create the technology to clean the air and the water, and then to install it and monitor the cleanup for these past 40 years proving that a reversal of the negative impact of our earlier irresponsibility is possible.\n \n So what is abusive on our part to expect third world countries to take advantage of existing technology which we have already invented as a small investment percentage of their manufacturing income in order to contribute to the pollution issue which they claim from the other side of their mouths is a do or die situation when speaking about the Wests need to do more. \n \n Then again, why am I not surprised by your corrupted and racist perspective of the situation. The fact that you actually think the US is motivated by desires to keep third world countries down says more about you than this stupid argument you pose.",

The US was the leader at that time. It was we, along with a few other economic superpowers of the period who pioneered the industrial waste and antipollution technology which cleaned up the first world countries environments.\n \n But here's the rub Iuris, all of that technology has existed for the full time that these third world countries have been developing their industrial bases and infrastructures. They had every advantage to go to these manufacturers of antipollution technology and purchase it ready made for their specific needs. It's not as if anyone was demanding cash on the barrel head for it. \n \n So when they say NOW that they are poor countries and can't afford the investment for these technologies to clean their air, rivers and streams which their factories dump toxic waste into unchecked and their smoke stacks spew carcinogens into the air without concern for anything but corporate profits, let me share what is actually happening in these corrupted governments which are run by individuals who sell the national good for individual graft, bribes and payoffs by the greedy corporations which are in bed with them. And none of that is america's fault, and I submit that we shouldn't make it our problem by being sucked into now paying for the scrubbers and filtration systems to clean their environments up. \n \n After all, what evidence do we have that these criminals who have profited so richly from their nations suffering thus far, would even allow these fixes to take place without first getting their cut which could destroy the viability of the clean up plan from succeeding anyway? \n \n So this is what we are up against here in reality. Those videos show the unwashed masses living in abject poverty and squalor, surrounded by a polluted environment while the unseen super rich politicians and corporate masters live in opulence at their expense; all the while these so called public servants cry to the UN that the average citizens suffering in their countries is our fault when it is they who are lining their pockets on that suffering they are creating through their own personal greed.\n \n My question for you Iuris, is why are you so inept as to not appreciate this scam which is being perpetrated on us? With the hundreds of billions of dollars in International Aid which has been given to third world countries in Africa for so many decades now, with only an elite minority profiting from it, you still blame us for their poverty? If that money was honestly and responsibly invested for the social and industrial infrastructure, there wouldn't be an impoverished third world today as there still is. Like I said in my post above: \n I am so sick of this guilt mentality you liberals are swallowing hook, line and sinker, that I want to puke. And you have said nothing to dispel that disgust. \n \n I repost this video for emphasis: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsjANjFlK0M&feature=related",

My post makes clear that there has been a relocation of the worlds manufacturing base. But that didn't happen over night, but over 40 years. And the fact remains that according to AGW defenders, the US is accused of still being the largest CO2 contributor on earth, a blatant lie. So you can't have it both ways and claim either or whenever it suits your argument. \n \n The fact remains that we did all of the leg work in fighting pollution while the up and coming third world industrial nations have done nothing to take advantage of that technology, while individuals enriched themselves at the expense of their environments and their citizens. You deny the obvious while claiming we are the problem.",

   "Don't you talk to me of denial of reality, creationist.\n\n \n You have no idea how tiring it is to always be confronted with the massive unprovable assumptions you evolutionists make regarding creationism/the Genesis Account for creation. You fail to appreciate that since you can't prove even the most basic foundational conclusions you base your complete theory upon, then the jury is still out regarding which of us is right in our chosen beliefs. My faith in the living God of Creation vs your faith in the lies and delusions of fallen Man; good luck with that.\n \n \nChina, ES, EU - almost even in carbon dioxide production. If you can't see all three, plus the others will have to change, I can't help you.\n\n \n Thankfully, I don't need your help understanding the issue as it exists. Conveying the culprits to the blind like you are is my problem. :xbanghead",

   "I can't profess to KNOW what's really going on behind the scenes, but I don't think this is about \"keeping the other one down\" and all.\n \n Environment is screwed up - even if global warming were not here, we'd still have the fact that we're running out of resources and over polluting the environment. And this happens BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE LIVE - this is the price of our lives of luxury.\n \n The problem is, what HAS been done has been done by the west. We got all the good parts for the cost, at least, while the undeveloped world hasn't even had the chance to enjoy some of the sin.\n \n And getting something done will mean changing. And no one wants to pay the price. Not the developed world, not the undeveloped world.\n\n \n I agree that in many parts of the world, we have a pollution problem. The difference is that CO2 isn't pollution, it's a nutrient for all plant life and Kyoto isn't addressing the real pollutants. \n China shut down its phosphate producers for several months prior to the Olympics because they didn't want the rest of the world to see just how bad the air quality really was.",
