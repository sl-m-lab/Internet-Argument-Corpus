Here\n \n And the test is This.\n \n They deal with value choices and could make for an interesting thread of their own. \n The movie deals with a ship sinking and only a single life boat remaining...that's simply too small to hold all the survivors. Initially you may be able to save them through judicious use of resources but, the approaching storm means the likelihood of the boat floundering are assured (remember, you're a sailor with years of experience) whom do you save, whom do you discard and why?\n \n The test is similar. You have a fallout shelter that can hold 7. You have 12 survivors. Who stays and who leaves? Why?\n \n While these deal with absolute life and death choices, every day we make decisions that could have long lasting consequences.\n Ever been a boss and had to release someone who was a hinderance to your business yet, you knew they had too many problems going on and the loss of their job could further those problems?\n Or, you have a choice to make on who to hire.

Equality is a made up idea presumably to make those lesser than others feel good about themselves. \n Afterall, no one wants to be viewed as a worthless piece of garbage useless to all others and more than likely a hinderance.\n There are those who contribute nothing, take from others and don't even have family and friends who love them.\n They aren't missed when they die. \n But, one only needs to look at self esteme in schools in the US to get a picture of this. Many changes have been made to make everyone feel 'equal' in school to help them feel good about themselves and have a healthy self picture. We now have a situation where the underachieving dregs feel quite good about themselves even though they will amount to nothing and have no real incentive to achieve success. We also see where over-achievers are held back and their accomplishments muted. If the rewards for success are the same for failure, what's the incentive? \n All this in the name of achieving equality.\n \n \n \nBut of course, from subjective point of view (reality is after all undiscriminating bitch and fight for survival, we all come to realize that at some point), like you said, it is not.

Equality is a made up idea presumably to make those lesser than others feel good about themselves. \n Afterall, no one wants to be viewed as a worthless piece of garbage useless to all others and more than likely a hinderance.\n There are those who contribute nothing, take from others and don't even have family and friends who love them.\n They aren't missed when they die. \n But, one only needs to look at self esteme in schools in the US to get a picture of this. Many changes have been made to make everyone feel 'equal' in school to help them feel good about themselves and have a healthy self picture. We now have a situation where the underachieving dregs feel quite Too bad. But then we are not living in a perfect world.good about themselves even though they will amount to nothing and have no real incentive to achieve success. We also see where over-achievers are held back and their accomplishments muted. If the rewards for success are the same for failure, what's the incentive? \n All this in the name of achieving equality.\n\n And what exactly makes them inferior, you o so mighty person? \n \n \n\n Actually I was born with the right to judge others. Much like yourself. It's quite natural. The only thing is, I'm not brainwashed by society into believing that there is some absolute prohibition on judging nor on taking a life if I deemed it necessary.\n\n Lol, your first sentance put a grin on my face. You have a right to judge others? Sorry, but there is such ignorant arrogance in that statment. You don't have a right to judge - you, me and all the others we take our value system and compare an act in accordance with that system and so judging to be good or bad, right or wrong; there is no prohibition as there is no given right. So what if some other person's point of view does not correspond with myown. Or yourown for that matter. It is the way we deal with it, that matters. And only a narrow-minded person would judge others inferior for their beliefs or abilities. They are just different. If you can not accept that, so be it. \n \n \n\n The society I live in allows me justifiable rights to take a life in some circumstances. \n\n I do to. But I wish the people would become mature enough, there would be no need for it.\n \n \n\n I'd hazard a guess that (as in history) if I were to simply kill you and any others who naysay this, eventually those who remain would agree with my position. They may even see such slaughter of those like you as being necessary for their own survival.After a generation or three, it'll be common practice to believe such is true.\n\n Yes yes, the history is written and morality is dictated by the winners.

The proof of this is the fact that most people mostly agree on what is or isn't moral. Given, there are exceptions, I recognize that. But if morals were whatever anyone wanted them to be, then there would be virtually no concensus at all; the idea of morality would be useless. Since this isn't the case there must be some unifying principle which is generally recognized which defines morallity.

It seems pretty clear to me is that what you are describing is someone ignoring their morals, for a short time. Are you simply calling morals \"whatever someone uses to decide what to do\"? Because I would define morals more like \"what someone uses to decide what is the good thing to do\", which is not the process that everyone uses all the time. Greed, lust, jealousy, fear and hatred are all examples of possible motives for actions which should not be confused with \"morals\".\n\n \n If a lynch mob was simply ignoring their morals, the groups would be unable to function.

These are certainly not perfectly practiced in that we pick and choose who we feel compassion for (often restricting it to members of a group to which we feel loyalty) and justifications for actions are often not based on verifiable reasons.

It makes them feel better also.\n \n \n I really think it's juvenile to discuss rights, an artificial construct and simple societial tool and actually believe in them the way some do.\n They are granted, taken away, change and are subject to interpretation on a consistant basis.\n In these discussions over value judgements, life and death rulings and other 'deep thought' issues.\n I wonder what would be the tone of this thread if we discussed the right to smile, laugh, cry, jump up and down, sleep and wet our pants.\n Do I have a right to do these?\n Who's to say I do.

   "Posit: Killing a human being is wrong. The only justifiable reason to kill a person is to prevent a greater wrong.\n \n Discuss.\nI say your posit contradicts itself. Being in two separate statements, it presents the diametrically opposed claims that killing a human being is wrong; killing a human being is right. (...assuming that one understands that to have a justifiable reason for doing something normally wrong makes it the right thing to do.) More correctly stated, the posit should be:Killing a human being is wrong except in cases where killing human beings prevents a greater wrong. I can agree with this reworded version.\n \n But then the radical Muslims would argue that refusal to join them in praying to Allah 5 times a day is a greater wrong than the killing of a human being. The relative value of human life varies greatly among people, even within a given race. The relative wrongness of any given act varies greatly among people, even within a given race.\n \n I doubt seriously that we could ever come up with a definitive list of things we all agreed to be suitable ways to justify killing someone. However, I do believe that we each have such a list and would unflinchingly kill humans to prevent worse things from happening...like the death of one of our own.\n \n To me, the very threat uttered by radical Muslims day after day justifies our killing them. Better they die than we die. Better they die than any innocent people die. The sooner they die (are killed) the sooner we will live without fear of random explosions at the shopping malls and wedding receptions.\n \n Posit: Some people need killing.\n \n \n Kill emoticon_xkill all radical Muslims and those who support them...and their children!!!",

He replied NO but that he had had his olfactory nerve severed and could smell NOTHING at all. My condolences.\n\n \n Well, it's a mixed blessing. Potentially dangerous too.\n \n I can't smell foulness but am still affected chemically at times.\n \n I didn't realize I was allergice to bleach until my son's birth and my allergies started acting up. Prior to that, I always thought is was seasonal. Quite annoying to have them go off in science classes and not know the reason when I was in high school.\n \n I can't smell nasty diapers...so had to be extra vigelant when I was a new father.\n \n I can't smell a gas leak from the stove nor smoke.\n I recall once cooking hamburgers and then forgetting about them with my back turned to the stove 3 feet away, stood up and found my head surrounded by thick black smoke. Thankfully no fire.\n \n I can't smell flowers nor perfume. My wife assures me she smells nice though and occasionally I'll wear something to please her even though it's meaningless to me. I do like the way roses feel but buy here the wildflowers she likes...occasionally with a rose added.\n \n I can't smell cabbage. I think it taste good though.\n \n I have been embarrased over body odor several times. In the past, I didn't quite catch on to what was the deal...unlike hearing and vision, no one tests for olfactory sense. It's a hidden handicap. I wasn't fully aware that I didn't have a sense of smell until later in life.\n Recently, I've had to inform bosses of this and that if I happen to smell 'ripe' to let me know. I carry back up deoderant and shower several times a day...but, I can occasionaly forget to wash a favorite jacket.\n \n I'm not affected to hunger by wafts of food smells and thusly am immune to manipulations to eat when don't need or want to. I was a fairly lean person until I hit my 30's and my metabolism slowed. I'm still lean compared to most.\n \n I really wouldn't know what I'd do if I ever acquired a sense of smell. You can't turn it off. Not ever having one, I find the prospect scary.\n \n I'm not bothered telling people I can't smell. I find it slightly comical.\n More so since I have a largish Polish/Cherokee nose...that's abolutly useless.\n \n Fortunatly my son has a very good sense of smell.\n \n I'm scentless and senseless...a scentless apprentice. -Nirvana.\n \n \n I like to fart a lot. \n I don't care if others are offended.\n \n I deserve a tax writeoff for my handicap!\n \n I have compensated with accute attention to visual detail and my job and hobby relies upon it even if my overall vision is also poor.\n I can always find green money in green grass...although that could be stingy, greedy bastard blood running through my veins. ;)",
