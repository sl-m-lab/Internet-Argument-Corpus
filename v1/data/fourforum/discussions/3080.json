She lamented the fact that President Bush invokes the name of Christ while bombing Iraq saying in essence that Christ said \"turn the other cheek\" and \"love your enemies\" and Denzel reminded her that that was not all Jesus said and brought up the example of Jesus driving out the money changers.

I hesitate to mention this, but you do know that the part on top, the part in green, is fake, right? Ignoring that part it sounded like a striaght forward exchange of views, with niether side scoring any particular points.",
