   "Guantanamo detainees to have art lessons and video games to distract from jihad - Telegraph\n \n \n Guantanamo detainees to have art lessons and video games to distract from jihad \n Terror suspects being held at Guantanamo Bay are to be offered art classes, Game Boys and film nights to distract them from thoughts of global jihad. \n \n By Tom Leonard in New York \n Last Updated: 8:57PM GMT 24 Nov 2008\n \n \nDetention camp staff at the US Navy base in Cuba are already teaching English to the 255 inmates despite fears that it might allow them to eavesdrop on their guards.\n \n Barack Obama, the US president-elect, has promised to close the camp, which was set up to hold foreign terrorism suspects captured after the American-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001.\n \n However, convinced that such a decision is a long way from being carried out, camp staff are attempting to soften the notoriously Spartan existence of Guantanamo inmates.\n \n \"We want to keep their brains stimulated. We're not here to give degrees,\" Zak, the camp's Arab-American cultural advisor, told the Miami Herald.\n \n \"Once they are engaged and busy, they leave the guards alone.\"\n \n Initiatives will include circulating Egyptian newspapers and Game Boy-style electronic games around the tiny cells and holding more \"movie nights\" featuring pre-recorded sport.\n \n Art and geology classes will also be offered, although the former will not include sharp objects. Prisoners are already allowed to have crayons and Zak said some were \"good artists\".\n \n Geology was chosen as a subject because it is grounded in earth and science issues rather than more sensitive areas such as politics and religion, he said.\n \n \"They draw greeting cards for family. They draw weapons,\" he said. \"They draw whatever they want. You can't stop a detainee from thinking.\" Kristin Wilhelm, a lawyer who represents Guantanamo detainees, said the cultural programme was seven years too late.\n",

   "Guantanamo Bay officials describe prison's progress - USATODAY.com\n \n \nGuantanamo Bay officials describe prison's progress \n \n By Alan Gomez, USA TODAY\n GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba &#8212; Any basic Internet search of Guantanamo Bay returns a flood of images of blindfolded detainees in orange jumpsuits housed in outdoor cages.\n \n That irks the military officials who run the jails on this military base. The cages, known as Camp X-Ray, haven't housed prisoners in six years, they said. They like to describe their new, state-of-the-art detention facilities that have cost more than $400 million to build and staff in terms more suited to summer camp than prisons.\n \n Camp X-Ray \"still is pushed out to the world as the current conditions at Guantanamo, but nothing could be further from the truth,\" said Rear Adm. David Thomas, the camps' commander.\n \n President-elect Barack Obama has said he wants to close the prison camp for suspected terrorists but has yet to say what he will do in its place.\n \n As they await the decision of their next commander in chief, the military officials who have run Guantanamo for President Bush say they are ready to hold on to America's enemies in Cuba or move them elsewhere.\n \n \"The hard part, the important part to get ready is where you're going to put the detainees, and the legal process that you intend to use to continue any sort of prosecution or resolution of their cases,\" Thomas said. \"The easy part is taking them from (Joint Task Force)-Guantanamo and putting them on an airplane.\"\n \n Guantanamo may be the best known prison in the world. Opened in 2002, it has been assailed by activist groups such as Human Rights Watch as a \"symbol of injustice\" and defended by the Pentagon as the most humane prison camp in history.\n \n In a recent tour provided by the military, reporters were led through the center and told that detainees take art classes, play soccer and basketball, and select Islamic dietary meals off menus.\n \n Guards quiet their movements to a hush around prayer time so as not to disturb the detainees. And the prisoners can watch DVDs (one of their favorites, says Navy Cmdr. Jeff Hayhurst, is \"Deadliest Catch,\" a series about the trials of Alaskan king crab fishermen on the Discovery Channel.)\n\n \n Pay special attention to this part....\n \n \nCamp officials have also had to adapt to a population that remains violent. Hayhurst estimates that there are up to 10 assaults a week on guards.\n \n Some throw urine or feces. When guards deliver food through a cell door inmates try to pull their arms in and break them, Hayhurst said. When guards reach through to shackle a detainee's feet, they sometimes try to stomp on the guard's hands, he said.\n\n \n \n Now Winston - how interesting is it that nothing you posted refuted what I said, and how amusing is it that what you posted varified what I said about how these people who throw the word \"torture\" around define it so loosely that it is ridiculous (and remember these were links YOU picked, not ones that were cherry picked by me). \n \n Indeed even putting your kid in his room for misbehaving and not telling him when he can come out is defined as torture by many of these groups because the prisoners aren't given an exact date when they will be released. \n \n I am sure that you wouldnt try to fool us now would you, indeed something must be wrong with your computer........",

The abuses at Guantanamo are well documented. I'm puzzled that you consider Amnesty International to be far left and/or anti-american. When did liberty cease to be an American value?\n\n \n \n Hello Jo Bennet, \n \n I am sorry that it seems possible that your homework on this issue was incomplete. It would have taken you all of 15 seconds to varify what I told you. But I understand that 15 seconds just maybe entirely too much time for someone as important and busy as yourself to take. Or it could be that your computer is broken just in the same way Winston's is. \n \n Fortunately I have some time to kill, a computer that is in good working order, and I am in the mood for being charitable. So lets start by Goggling \"Amnesty International Bias\" .... Hmm only 245,000 hits. Let us examine a few shall we??\n \n \n http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/groupProfile.asp?grpid=6185\n \n This tells about how Amnesty International glossed over the human rights abuses of the USSR and the Soviet Empire but piled on the United States and Israel to the point of being silly. I like thsi site because it gives tons of links and delivers the evidence in detail.\n \n \n EclectEcon: Amnesty International's Anti-Israel Bias\n \n Oh look, its an article from Professor Volokh on Amnesty International's unfair anti-Israel bias and how they report unsubstantiated allegations against Israel as fact. How nice of them.\n \n \n http://www.ngo-monitor.org/data/images/File/NGO_Front_Gaza.pdf\n \n Oh look, this is a report from NGO-Monitor. It tells how UN NGO's (including Amnesty International) target Israel for unfair treatment amd gloss over the incedents where Jews are killed. It is 57 pages long, fully sourced and gives very detailed descriptions. Happy reading!\n \n \n \n Scrutinize Amnesty International - May 23, 2007 - The New York Sun\n \n Look, this is a New York Sun article about a report from the British magazine, The Economist. Appearently they say that the United States, Britian and Israel are constantly under fire from Amnesty International and the abuses in the middle-east, you know against women and such, are not nearly as often reported by them... Oh look it also tells about how many of the so called abuses they report are just allegations that have not been professionally investigated.....hmm lets get a few quotes shall we:\n \n \nRecently, the Economist, published in Britain, noted that \"an organisation which devotes more pages in its annual report to human-rights abuses in Britain and America than those in Belarus and Saudi Arabia cannot expect to escape doubters' scrutiny.\" Other critics, including law professor at Harvard, Alan Dershowitz, and the U.S.-based Capital Research Center, have been more pointed, providing evidence of Amnesty's systematic bias and reports based largely on claims by carefully selected \"eyewitnesses\" in Colombia, Gaza, and Lebanon.\n \n Using a detailed and sophisticated qualitative model for comparing relative resources devoted to the different countries, this report clearly shows that in 2006, Amnesty singled out Israel for condemnation of human rights to a far greater extent than Iran, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Syria, Egypt, and other chronic abusers of human rights.\n \n During the year, Amnesty issued 48 publications critical of Israel, compared to 35 for Iran, 2 for Saudi Arabia, and only 7 for Syria. Many of the attacks directed at Israel took place during the war with Hezbollah, but this terror group and state-within-a-state also got relatively little attention from Amnesty.\n \n Furthermore, as Amnesty has almost no professional researchers, many of the \"factual\" claims in these reports were provided by \"eyewitnesses,\" whose political affiliations and credibility can be only guessed.\n\n \n \n I know Jo Bennet, maybe, just maybe, your computer is broken in the same way that Winston's is, that when you Google any possible results that you may find inconvenient just don't appear on the screen. \n \n Have you considered calling the Geek Squad to get your PC fixed? Cause I know that you wouldn't try to fool me right?",

There were war crimes trials for war criminals in special courts designed for them, spies and others were given military tribunals. Perhaps president's FDR and Truman and Eike should be brought up on charges for denying prisoners of common law rights??\n \n Next question: Can you name me a country who did it during WWI? \n \n Did George Washington do it during the Revolutionary War?\n \n Did Thomas Jefferson do it during the war with the Barbary States?\n \n \n Why - well it may be possible that you won't take my word for it - so how about the United States Supreme Court\n \n \nJOHNSON V. EISENTRAGER, 339 U. S. 763 (1950) -- US Supreme Court Cases from Justia & Oyez\n \n U.S. Supreme Court\n Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763 (1950)\n Johnson v. Eisentrager\n \n No. 306\n \n Argued April 17, 1950\n \n Decided June 5, 1950\n \n 339 U.S. 763\n \n \n Syllabus \n \n Respondents, who are nonresident enemy aliens, were captured in China by the United States Army and tried and convicted in China by an American military commission for violations of the laws of war committed in China prior to their capture. They were transported to the American-occupied part of Germany and imprisoned there in the custody of the Army. At no time were they within the territorial jurisdiction of any American civil court. Claiming that their trial, conviction, and imprisonment violated Articles I and III, the Fifth Amendment, and other provisions of our Constitution, laws of the United States, and provisions of the Geneva Convention, they petitioned the District Court for the District of Columbia for a writ of habeas corpus directed to the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army, and several officers of the Army having directive power over their custodian.\n \n Held:\n \n 1. A nonresident enemy alien has no access to our courts in wartime. Pp. 339 U. S. 768-777.\n \n (c) Executive power over enemy aliens, undelayed and unhampered by litigation, has been deemed, throughout our history, essential to wartime security. P. 339 U. S. 774.\n \n (d) A resident enemy alien is constitutionally subject to summary arrest, internment, and deportation whenever a \"declared war\" exists. Courts will entertain his plea for freedom from executive custody only to ascertain the existence of a state of war and \n \n Page 339 U. S. 764\n \n whether he is an alien enemy. Once these jurisdictional facts have been determined, courts will not inquire into any other issue as to his internment. P. 339 U. S. 775.\n \n (e) A nonresident enemy alien, especially one who has remained in the service of the enemy, does not have even this qualified access to our courts. P. 339 U. S. 776.\n \n 2. These nonresident enemy aliens, captured and imprisoned abroad, have no right to a writ of habeas corpus in a court of the United States. Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1; In re Yamashita, 327 U. S. 1, distinguished. Pp. 339 U. S. 777-781.\n \n 3. The Constitution does not confer a right of personal security or an immunity from military trial and punishment upon an alien enemy engaged in the hostile service of a government at war with the United States. Pp. 339 U. S. 781-785.\n \n (a) The term \"any person\" in the Fifth Amendment does not extend its protection to alien enemies everywhere in the world engaged in hostilities against us. Pp. 339 U. S. 782-783.\n \n (b) The claim asserted by respondents and sustained by the court below would, in practical effect, amount to a right not to be tried at all for an offense against our armed forces. P. 339 U. S. 782.\n \n 4. The petition in this case alleges no fact showing lack of jurisdiction in the military authorities to accuse, try, and condemn these prisoners, or that they acted in excess of their lawful powers. Pp. 339 U. S. 785-790.\n \n (a) The jurisdiction of military authorities, during or following hostilities, to punish those guilty of offenses against the laws of war is long established. P. 339 U. S. 786.\n \n (b) It being within the jurisdiction of a military commission to try these prisoners, it was for it to determine whether the laws of war applied, and whether they had been violated. Pp. 339 U. S. 786-788.\n \n (c) It is not the function of the Judiciary to entertain private litigation -- even by a citizen -- which challenges the legality, wisdom, or propriety of the Commander in Chief in sending our armed forces abroad or to any particular region. P. 339 U. S. 789.\n \n (d) Nothing in the Geneva Convention makes these prisoners immune from prosecution or punishment for war crimes. P. 339 U. S. 789.\n \n (e) Article 60 of the Geneva Convention, requiring that notice of trial of prisoners of war be given to the protecting power, is inapplicable to trials for war crimes committed before capture. Pp. 339 U. S. 789-790.\n \n (f) Article 63 of the Geneva Convention, requiring trial of prisoners of war \"by the same courts and according to the same \n \n Page 339 U. S. 765\n \n procedure as in the case of persons belonging to the armed forces of the detaining Power,\" is likewise inapplicable to trials for war crimes committed before capture. P. 339 U. S. 790.\n \n 5. Since there is no basis in this case for invoking federal judicial power, it is not necessary to decide where, if the case were otherwise, the petition should be filed. Pp. 339 U. S. 790-791.\n",

   "Apparently none to you. And unfortunately, I do not get a daily brief from the Pentagon or the CIA on their gathered intel. However, it is widely known that some of the high profile subjects that were subject to interrogation and torture have given up valuable intel that led to the arrest of others and information related to past and planned terrorist activities. Waterboarding is cruel, it is torture, it is grossly inhumane, and it is highly effective. Apparently CIA operatives that volunteered to undergo waterboarding to understand it's effects had an average time of 14 seconds before they tapped out. I even saw a video on the internet of a reporter that volunteered to have it done to him, he made it about 5 seconds before he had to stop. I firmly believe that the Bush administration vastly overstated and flat out lied about some of the intel that came out of such practices, but I am also firmly convinced that did get some actionable and valuable intel none the less. We will probably never know the true extent of the intel that was obtained, it just doesn't happen that way. I certainly don't agree with torturing people, but I do know that it can be quite effective.\n\n \n \n I have never been subjected to waterboarding, but once when I was a kid I was dragged by the surf to the bottom as a huge wave broke over me.

I was arrested on a 'terrorism' charge IN THE US. I was detained and had my 'civil rights' violated in the year 2000 (Clinton Admin. btw). This was on US soil too. \n I was convicted of nothing.\n No evidence existed to substantiate the charge against me beyond one person's word.\n I lost a gov't job and spent 9 days in jail (longer than the 3 they stated they wanted to detain me for in court when I didn't have legal representation).\n I could go on.\n \n Yeah, a freaking sob story yet true.\n \n So, you're pereaching to the WRONG fella when you complain about things you really haven't even experienced yourself nor have any notion of what's really going on.\n I work in the media business currently. Public Relations. \n As to that, an official opposed to Gitmo (IIRC) did state on MSNBC news that actioanable information was obtained from waterboarding of Al Qaeda susect.\n \n The problem with your belief is that you want to extrapolate a notion and think that NO information is brought about by 'torture'. Such has NEVER been the case. It's a prime reason why torture has been used for ages. You can get something out of it and the more skilled the interrogator, the more accurate the information. It can be corroborated by other sources to a certain degree.\n The problem with torture is that the information may not always be reliable and accurate. Each person has their own threshhold for this activity. Some can be pretty resilient to pain and other adverse effects.\n Further, occasionally, the one detained can mislead.\n Actionable information is quite often gotten though and to state otherwise is just stupid. It defies logic and the abundant evidence through out the ages.\n If useable intelligence was NEVER gotten by torture, many lives wouldn't have been lost as a result of military action acted on such intelligence. National secrets wouldn't have been spilt. Kings and World leaders the ages over would have not died.\n \n There are many reasons to torture someone. \n Often, when it's applied improperly, it's done to coerce a confession. Chicago is currently dealing with such cases of police forced confessions gathered from 'torture'.\n Such a case is simply getting someone to tell you what you want them to say.\n That is somewhat different to getting someone to 'tell you the story'.\n \n As for who decides who a suspect is, that would be the US forces in the field.\n I'd not take 'hand-over prisoners' from a 2nd party unless they were specifically on a wanted list. If such other terrorists were found I'd let the finding party deal with them.\n IIRC, Newsweek and Time had nice GRAPHIC spreads of the Northern Alliance capturing Taliban fighters back in 2001. They simply shot them. \n The Geneva Convention does NOT cover such civil issues.\n If you are in a civil war, the GC doesn't apply. PERIOD.\n It's funny sometimes visiting a US 'militia' web site and watching them try to figure out ways to get the GC to apply to them. I even read a Montana Milita article that advised the rebels to snip at officials and when faced with capture, to tie on a bandana to their arms so as to claim to be in 'uniform.' LOL.\n \n The 'war on terror' was lost the moment it was declared. \n Terrorism isn't something you can war with. \n You either cave in to their demands, put up with it, or out-terrorize your opposition until they are all dead (genocide) or they get so disgusted that they cave in and comply with your demands.\n \n \n And, um Chester, what makes righties angry are the moronic and ever-angry lefties.\n For all the alleged anger...you don't tend to see righties rioting and causing problems...something 'lefties' are noted for.\n \n I'd wager a bet that you could more easily anger a leftie than a rightie.\n Heck, your posts tend to be hateful and angry.\n By comparison, mine are just callous.",

Apparently CIA operatives that volunteered to undergo waterboarding to understand it's effects had an average time of 14 seconds before they tapped out. I even saw a video on the internet of a reporter that volunteered to have it done to him, he made it about 5 seconds before he had to stop. I firmly believe that the Bush administration vastly overstated and flat out lied about some of the intel that came out of such practices, but I am also firmly convinced that did get some actionable and valuable intel none the less. We will probably never know the true extent of the intel that was obtained, it just doesn't happen that way. I certainly don't agree with torturing people, but I do know that it can be quite effective.\n\n \n It's gotta be hard for you to focus on the point when you clearly don't know what you are talking about.

Nazi or not.\n Of course they were not tortured but I have my doubts whether they were subjected to a game of chess either.\n Breaking the German codes and general subtefuge was the methods that brought the information that mattered.\n However you implied that treating the Nazi leaders gave us valueable information and method of obtaining that was by befriending and interrogation techniques.\n It did not happen and could not happen because they were caught after the war was won.\n I am sure that the resistance fighters found that torturing the odd German gave them some good results and maybe the Germans found the same with the resistance fighters but if it were known that the Allies were torturing soldiers then the Germans would have done the same.\n Nevertheless we should not present false examples of interrogation technique successes.",

It was about the devious Brits sending an undercover agent of their own to German occupied France to make contact with the French resistance and deliver the plans for some forthcoming operations against the Germans and also of imminent British landings. The man is captured by the Germans tortured and under torture reveals all he knows and even gives away those persons he knew in the French Resistance. He is spared by the Germans and after the war ends we find him back in London ridden with guilt. He meets by chance (I think) the officer who sent him in that mission and the officer tells him that he knew that he would break under torture and reveal the information he posessed which was false and intended to mislead the Germans. He intentionally was given away to the Germans for the Germans would think that information extracted under torture had to be the real thing which for the man being tortured it was.\n The poor man is shocked by what was done to him, he was used as a pawn, but more than that he is shocked to see that the officer profiled him as a weak man who would talk under torture. I think the officer denies that and says to him that all of us break under torture, but I am not sure",

So it is with Binyam Mohamed, an Ethopian-born British resident whose actual residence for the past 41/2 years has been Guantanamo Bay.\n \n Before being sent to Cuba he had already been a refugee, drifted into drugs, and went to Afghanistan to see Muslim countries \"with his own eyes\". In April 2002 he was arrested at Karachi airport while attempting to return to England. The Pakistanis handed him over to the Americans who \"rendered him to ghost prisons\" run by US and British intelligence agencies. In particular, he wound up in Morocco, where his treatment was not good. Scalpels allegedly were used on his penis and chest to get him to talk.\n \n He couldn't have had much useful to say because all that could be mustered against him was a charge of conspiracy. It seems most of the evidence came from someone else who was waterboarded. The US Government dropped the charges against Mohamed but he's still banged up at Guantanamo.\n \n There is a kind of transfixing symmetry to these sorts of cases. A man tortured (the US word is \"coerced\") to give information is charged on the strength of the evidence of another tortured prisoner. The evidence is so unreliable and farcical that the case craters. All part of the war on terrorism.\n \n Even so, Mohamed has not been idle, and nor have his lawyers. He has engaged in a hunger strike and earlier this month his US military lawyer, Lieutenant Colonel Yvonne Bradley, said he was close to death and that conditions at Guantanamo were dire.\n \n excerpt from:\n \n National security means thumbs-up for torture | smh.com.au",

He is believed to be in poor health after a hunger strike that ended earlier this month.\n \n Mohamed, who has been given interim leave to remain in the UK, was detained for several hours under the Terrorism Act 2000, but was not arrested. He was later released.\n \n A Scotland Yard spokesman said: \" Police are conducting investigations into his case. Their inquiries are being carried out, as they must be, strictly in accordance with UK law.\"\n \n Shortly before the plane touched down after the 10-hour flight, which included a refuelling stop in Bermuda, Mohamed's legal team issued a statement in which the released detainee accused Britain of direct collusion in his torture.\n \n \n Binyam Mohamed returns to Britain after Guant\u00e1namo ordeal | World news | guardian.co.uk",
