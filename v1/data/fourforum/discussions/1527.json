There is a difference, though which I do not deny. Those other cultures hardly if ever have experienced racism in america.\n Living in povery is not uniqute to African-Americans, and almost every culter that began in povery has put a strong value on education and it has paid off.\n This will be harder for poor African-Americans, as most of the poor are not educated, many are unemployeed or in jail, and almost all grow up in a 1 parent family. These aspects are unique to African-Americans, BUT it is NOT fair to put ALL of it on white America. white america IS responsible to an extent for a number of the problems in today's poor black american culture.\n However, white america does NOI control the extent of black american culture's falures. That has been done by black americans to themselves, and while there is a relationship between ALL OF IT, much time has past, black americans should have been able to make more significant strides EVEN WITH\n the destruction that the Regan Administration caused in the black community, with high unemployment.\n \n I'm not unaware of what your talking about in ANY way rapture. However, the answers will not be found in reparations. A college education for all americans, should be a right fought for by black americans. Once that is obtained, it does open a number of doors and will always end up in a job that can pay more money.\n \n The rest of it needs to be changed by blacks. Sitting back and blaming whites is not gonna get blacks anywhere, nor is going for the quick buck, or deserting kids and wives, to let most kids grow up without a father, and with an overworked mother. All of that needs to be changed by the vast majority of poor blacks, before they can hope to lift themselves out of poverty.",

   "The essence is not the individual ownership of slaves, but rather the fact that world capitalism in general and Euro-American capitalims in specific had forged a slave-based economy in which all settlers gained and took part. Historian Samuel Eliot Morison, in his study of The European Discovery of America, notes that after repeated failures the Europeans learned that North American settler colonies were not self-sufficient;(...)\n \n But why should the British aristocracy and capitalists invest in small family farms- and how great a trade is possible when what the settlers produced was largely the raw materials and foodstuffs they themselves needed? Slavery throughout the \"New World\" answered these questions. It was the unpaid, expropriated labor of millions of Indian and Afrikan captive slaves that created the surpluses on which the settler economy floated and Atlantic trade flourished.\n \n So all sections of white settler society- even the artisan, worker, and farmer- were totally dependant on Afrikan slave labor: the fisherman whose low-grade, 'refuse fish' was dried and sold as slave meal in the Indies; the New York farmer who found his market for surpluses in the Southern plantations; the forester whose timber was used by shipyard workers rapidly turning out slave ships; the clerk in the New York export house checking bales of tobacco awaiting shipment to London; the master cooper in the Boston rum distillery; the young Virginia overseer building up his \"stake\" to try and start his own plantation; the immigrant German farmer renting a team of five slaves to get his farm started; and on and on. While the cream of the profits went to the planter and merchant capitalists, the entire settler economy was raised up on the foundation of slave labor, slave products, and the slave trade.\nfrom Settlers by J. Sakai\n \n Like it or not, every white settler in the US today has had advantages because of the disadvantages of others. You cannot have extreme poverty without extreme wealth, and vice versa. If some people are rich and others are poor, the only place the surplus money of the could possibly have come from is either the land, tax, or labor of those poor people.

   "Slavery was a gross violation of human rights. Justice would demand that slave owners make compensatory reparation payments to slaves. Since both slaves and slave owners are no longer with us, compensation is beyond our reach.\n \n Absent from the reparations debate is who pays? Don't say the government because the government doesn't have any money that it doesn't first take from some American. So which Americans owe black people what? Reparations advocates don't want that question asked, but let's you and I ask it.\n \n Are the millions of Europeans, Asian and Latin Americans who immigrated to the U.S. in the 20th century responsible for slavery, and should they be forced to cough up reparations money? What about descendants of Northern whites who fought and died in the name of freeing slaves? Should they cough up reparations money for black Americans? What about non-slave-owning Southern whites, who are a majority of Southern whites -- should they be made to pay reparations?\n \n On black people's side of the ledger, thorny issues also arise. Some blacks purchased other blacks as a means to free family members. But other blacks owned slaves for the same reason whites owned slaves -- to work farms or plantations. Are descendants of these blacks eligible and deserving of reparations?\n \n There is no way that Europeans could have captured millions of Africans. They had African and Arab help. Should Powell haul representatives of Ghana, Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Muslim states before Congress and demand they pay reparations? By the way, is there anyone prepared to make the argument that blacks in America today would be better off if they were in Africa? If blacks wouldn't be better off, then why the reparations?\n \n Reparations advocates make the foolish unchallenged pronouncement that United States became rich on the backs of free black labor. That's utter nonsense. Slavery doesn't have a very good record of producing wealth. Think about it. Slavery was all over the South and outlawed in most of the North. Buying into the reparations nonsense, the antebellum South was rich and the slave-starved North was poor. The truth is just the opposite. In fact, the poorest states and regions of our country were places where slavery flourished: Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, while the richest states and regions were those where slavery was absent: Pennsylvania, New York and Massachusetts.\n \n The reparations movement would be little more than an amusing side-show were it not for the damage it can do to blacks. It misallocates time and resources that could be more fruitfully spent elsewhere.\n \n There's a growing black-owned and operated private school movement that addresses the fraudulent education of the public school system. Resources of the reparations movement could be used to add more private schools. High-powered reparations lawyers could use their legal skills to make court challenges of numerous state and local monopolistic regulations that stop people from getting into business, such as taxi licensing laws, cosmetology regulations, and restrictions on jitney and limousine operations.\n \n I'd like to see lawyers bring class action suits against public school systems in cities like Philadelphia, Washington, Detroit and New York for producing fraudulent education -- certifying youngsters as high school graduates when those youngsters can't perform at seventh- and eighth-grade levels.\n \n There's reparations issues completely ignored: Blacks as well as whites live on land taken, sometimes brutally, from Indians. Do we blacks owe Indians anything? Whites served as slaves (indentured servants) in more numbers than blacks. So do these whites who were denyed their freedom deserve anything?",

   "Slavery was a gross violation of human rights. Justice would demand that slave owners make compensatory reparation payments to slaves. Since both slaves and slave owners are no longer with us, compensation is beyond our reach.\n \n Absent from the reparations debate is who pays? Don't say the government because the government doesn't have any money that it doesn't first take from some American. So which Americans owe black people what? Reparations advocates don't want that question asked, but let's you and I ask it.\n \n Are the millions of Europeans, Asian and Latin Americans who immigrated to the U.S. in the 20th century responsible for slavery, and should they be forced to cough up reparations money? What about descendants of Northern whites who fought and died in the name of freeing slaves? Should they cough up reparations money for black Americans? What about non-slave-owning Southern whites, who are a majority of Southern whites -- should they be made to pay reparations?\n \n On black people's side of the ledger, thorny issues also arise. Some blacks purchased other blacks as a means to free family members. But other blacks owned slaves for the same reason whites owned slaves -- to work farms or plantations. Are descendants of these blacks eligible and deserving of reparations?\n \n There is no way that Europeans could have captured millions of Africans. They had African and Arab help. Should Powell haul representatives of Ghana, Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Muslim states before Congress and demand they pay reparations? By the way, is there anyone prepared to make the argument that blacks in America today would be better off if they were in Africa? If blacks wouldn't be better off, then why the reparations?\n \n Reparations advocates make the foolish unchallenged pronouncement that United States became rich on the backs of free black labor. That's utter nonsense. Slavery doesn't have a very good record of producing wealth. Think about it. Slavery was all over the South and outlawed in most of the North. Buying into the reparations nonsense, the antebellum South was rich and the slave-starved North was poor. The truth is just the opposite. In fact, the poorest states and regions of our country were places where slavery flourished: Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, while the richest states and regions were those where slavery was absent: Pennsylvania, New York and Massachusetts.\n \n The reparations movement would be little more than an amusing side-show were it not for the damage it can do to blacks. It misallocates time and resources that could be more fruitfully spent elsewhere.\n \n There's a growing black-owned and operated private school movement that addresses the fraudulent education of the public school system. Resources of the reparations movement could be used to add more private schools. High-powered reparations lawyers could use their legal skills to make court challenges of numerous state and local monopolistic regulations that stop people from getting into business, such as taxi licensing laws, cosmetology regulations, and restrictions on jitney and limousine operations.\n \n I'd like to see lawyers bring class action suits against public school systems in cities like Philadelphia, Washington, Detroit and New York for producing fraudulent education -- certifying youngsters as high school graduates when those youngsters can't perform at seventh- and eighth-grade levels.\n \n There's reparations issues completely ignored: Blacks as well as whites live on land taken, sometimes brutally, from Indians. Do we blacks owe Indians anything? Whites served as slaves (indentured servants) in more numbers than blacks. So do these whites who were denyed their freedom deserve anything?\n\n \n \n It hink you make some good points. My decendants didn't move here until 1890, so I don't think I owe reperations. Also, what about blacks that migrated here after slavery? Shouldn't they be excluded from any form of reparation agreement?\n \n And are the citezens of the US really responsible for paying reperation at all? Contrary to what certain bleeding heart liberals and certain leaders of the black community would like oyu to believe, the slave markets in Africa were legendary for their scale. The majority of slaves that were imported to America were not rounded up and captured by white slavers, they were bought at the pre-existing slave markets. Sholdn't reperations come from those that originally enslaved them, as opposed to the salve traders who showed up later and bought them? That would entail tracking down the original slavers in africa. Good luck!\n \n If we want to pay reperations to somebody, how about the chinese, who were forced wo work under terrible conditions building the railroads which opened up the west. How about the IRsih who were so badly mistreated when they were arriving in great numbers. \n \n If that is going to become a national policy, we should probably force the british to pay reperations to the scotish, who were used ad slaves in the cola mines.\n \n A better idea, how about if we get on wiuth things, people accept the fact that EVERY group of people on the planet has at some time or another been subjegated to the will of another, and quite all the incessant whining.\n \n I would have to disagree with something treat said a page back about racism being a problem we won't admit to. I can not recall even a single incident of racism that I have personally witnessed. Perhapse it is where I am located, perhapse I have just been lucky. \n \n I would agree that certain blacks play the racial card pretty heavily as an excuse. I ahd a black guy working for me for a long time, and every time he would be given a task that he didn't find to his liking, it was becuase I was racist. He ended up having three projects not completed on time, and I fired him. This is my standard practice for contract labor, and exceptions to this are pretty rare, although I did give a guy a break one time becaus ehis wife died of cancer during the course of the project, and another guy got a break because his car was hit by a train (with him in it) and he was in intensive care fgor 21 weeks.\n \n When I called this particular individual and gave him a chance to explain his failure to produce the required results in the alloted time wihtou bothering to let me know that there would be a delay, he said \"you just don't understand how hard it is for a black man in america.\" I canceled his contract, and he sued for discrimination. He lost, but I spent nearly $20,000 defending that lawsuit.\n \n To me, what he was saying is \"I cant get my work done on time becasue I am black\". When you see guys in prison for murder who say they commited their crimes because of racism and becuae of the strain that society puts on blacks, what I hear is \"I murder people because I am black.\"\n \n And I happen to know that is BS. I have knwos some black people in my time who COULD get their work done, and never felt the need to kill anybody based on the racial tensions of this country. \n \n \n \n If I am walking down a dark street and I hear footsteps behind me, I hope it is a white guy--\n \n Jesse Jackson",

   "Mizmaxx,\n Well, I will tell you flat out that everyone is responsible for their own actions-black, white, yellow-and NOTHING that is done to any in those groups should be used as an excuse for problems in their lives. Sorry, I know that's cold hearted in today's PC world, but deal with it. What I was obviously referring to when I made this statement is that whenever a Black person is arrested, the first thing out of their mouths is that it's all racism-in other words, they are completely innocent of all crimes and the police just dragged them out of their homes and arrested them for no good reason. Personal responsibility has nothing to do with racism, so please don't try to turn this around and make me or anyone else not agreeing with you to be a racist. I've got news for you, Whites are not the only ones who are racist. Anyway, it seems to me that you are a bigger part of the problem than a racist pig such as myself. You are an \"enabler\", offering excuses for the \"oppressed\" so that they don't have to live up to their responsibilities to be productive, law-abiding citizens. \n \n OH, and by the way, I'm DYING to know what privileges I enjoy-please enlighten me\n \n \n \nDo you feel that black people are personally responsible for injustices done to them? If not, what does personal responsibility have to do with racism?\n \n In other words, do you believe it is okay to be racist against someone because you think they've done something wrong? Does someone have to be virtuous to deserve just treatment?\n \n \n \n Irrelevant as well as impossible to gauge. How do you seperate someone's individual choices in the face of centuries of oppression? Also, whether or not some people may have made bad decisions does not take away the necessity for justice- in fact, people tend to be much more just in their actions when they experience justice in my experience.\n \n \n \n It would be impossible to correct such a wrong. No amount of reparations can compare with such a thing. BTW, there is no such thing as \"a Black\", there are people who call themselves \"Black people\".\n \n \n \n I can't speak for rapture, or for Black people in any sense, but I can say this-\n \n 1- You don't have the money or the power to offer any such thing. All you can change is your own behavior.\n \n 2- You are not being asked to take responsibility for things you have nothing to do with. You are being asked to look realistically at the privilege you have as a result of things you have nothing to do with. You are being asked to not participate in this process you didn't start. You are being asked to live your life with integrity, and pursue justice and truth despite the convenience of choosing ignorance. \n \n 3- I can virtually guarantee that the screaming about racism will diminish (if not disappear) when racism ends. If nothing else, that might be a good reason for you to look towards stopping racism.\n \n My point in summary is this- you seem frustrated by people (Black people in particular) showing certain symptoms of a problem. The solution is not to get them to shut up, the solution is to work on the problem of racism itself.\n",

He was the only one who ever indicated he felt my motivations towards him were racist.\n \n Persoanlly, I couldn't care less if a guy is black, white, yellow, purple, I don't care. I fire people who are too lazy or too stupid to get theri work done. I also fire people do test positive on 2 drug tests (insurance), commit a felony while in my employ (security clearance). \n \n I will admit that it is much easier for people to go \"It's beacuse I'm balck\" than it is to say \"it's because I'm lazy\".\n \n If I WAS racist, I wouldn't have hired the guy at all, and I would have had no problem with that. It is my company, if I didn't want to hire black folks, I wouldn't, and I would fight to the death before letting anybody make me. \n \n We have the only public building in the entire county that allows smoking. There is a law here that says no smoking in public buildings. I say, it is my building. I built it, I own it, I operate it, and I will allow smoking there if I damn well please. I feel the same way about my hiring. If I didn't like black people, I wouldn't hire them.\n \n People need to GET OVER this. It happens to fat people and ugly people all the time. A pretty woman applies for a job and an ugly woman applies for the same job, they both have the same qualifications, the pretty one gets hired. A pretty woman and an ugly woman apply for a job, pretty woman has no skills at all and still gets the job. It hapens all the time. Deal with it.\n \n LIFE IS NOT FAIR. If you were not taught this by your parents, they did a poor job teaching you. If you were not taught this in school, you need to go back and sue the school district because they failed to educate you. The only folks who can be expected to treat you fairly is the government and government agencies.\n \n I do not think I would have any trouble identifying racism, because franky, I wouldn't care if I saw it, unless it was from a government institution, in which case I would be outraged. As far as the private sector goes, I think people have a right to their opinions. If a private employer doesn't want minorities around, or a private school, I think they have that right. Enforcing civil rights laws on private individuals and private businesses is just trading the rights of one group of folks (whoever owns the business or school or whatever) for the percieved rights of another. And I say percieved rights because I don't feel anybody has any rights or privliges in my home or my place of business besides the ones I give them. On the street, people are free do do and say what they want. At work, I am not shy at all about telling people to shut up, and I would have no reservations about firing them if they failed to do so. \n \n I serioously doubt I would be sued for violating their first amendment rights in such a case.",

Some people have trouble maintaining objectivity. Racism is a bad thing. Unfortunatly some people see a bud thing and feel that we need to go to absolute extremes, even when it means trampling the rights of others, to rectify the situation. The solution is fairly simple. The black community in America (I can't speak ofr other countries) needs to pull itself out of the slump it is in. Nobody can do it for them, no law can be passed that will solve the problem and no amount of additional funding can fix the mess.\n \n I know that here in kansas, there are multiple programs available to help inner city youth (both black and white) get an education and improve their circumstances. We have open enrollment in our universities here We have GED programs. We have work study programs for college kids that gaurantee that if they work 20 hours a week on campus, their tuition is free. There are federal funding programs for eduction (I dated a girl who went all the way through college on federal grants and loans). For any poor person to say \"I wasn't given a fair chance to get an education\" is crazy.\n \n I think that when it comes to college, middle class kids have it rogher than poor kids. I am from a middle class family. My father made about 90,000/yr. Seems like a lot. I have 7 brothers and sisters. Take 90,000 and devide it by 10, and it is not so much. I didn't qualify for finacial aid. A girl I was dating at the time was from a lower class family. She pretty much got a free ride to college (of course, now she has student loans to repay....boo hoo).\n \n If you look at the demographics for the inner cty education opportunities we have here in kansas, you find that many of them were shut down due to \"lack of interest\". Nobody was enrolling in them. The ones that did manage to get people enrolled, the majority of them were not black, although the programs in many cases specifically target the black population (even going so far as to hire black instructors so the students would feel more comfortable). \n \n Maybe it is different in other states.

Why haven't you addressed that it's the ISSUE Blacks really want to hold over White's heads?\n\n Why don't you make a point and I'll address it. What you said here doesn't really make sense. It sounds like you're saying that \"Black racism against Whites\" is the issue that \"Blacks really want to hold over White's heads\"?\n \n I'd be interested to know what you feel is being held over your head, and the heads of all white people. I myself am not Black and have never felt that anything was being held over my head...\n \n \nI really would like you to tel me about my privileges-spell it out for me please, I want to hear YOU say it.\n\n Why? You know what privileges you have, and this debate is about you trying to protect them. I can understand that, from a certain vantage point, it seems to make sense to try to keep your privileges. But in the end these are nothing compared to what you lose in human integrity.\n \n \nThe black community in America (I can't speak ofr other countries) needs to pull itself out of the slump it is in.\n\n I guess it's just too bad that there aren't any black people who are as smart as you. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nWe have work study programs for college kids that gaurantee that if they work 20 hours a week on campus, their tuition is free.(...) For any poor person to say \"I wasn't given a fair chance to get an education\" is crazy.\n\n How about we make it fair then? Every college student has to get a job on campus working 20 hrs a week while going to school full-time, taking care of their kids etc., gets the same amount of income and spending money. If you can't get a job on campus, tough luck. If you can't live on a few hundred dollars a month, tough luck. Then we'd see who the real whiners are. \n \n \nThe ones that did manage to get people enrolled, the majority of them were not black, although the programs in many cases specifically target the black population \n\n That's because, as most people know, a black person with a BA is just a bit more likely to get hired at the Burger Barn than without one.",

   "Mizzmaxx,\n Thank you for the info!\n \nWhat is wrong with \"whining and crying\" (in other words protesting) someone hitting you because of racism? How do you know it wasn't? \n\n \n Can you site the statitics that show how often the evil White man has hit a Black simply because of their race?\n \n \nWhy do you presume that the person who claims that it is because of racism is lying?\n \n\n \n We could go on and on like this forever, but why do you presume that the person claiming racism is telling the truth?\n \n \nWhat you are responsible for is what you have done(/are doing) or have allowed(/are allowing) to happen through inaction. \n \n\n \n So, let me get this straight, along with all of my other responsibilities (work, family), I'm supposed to \"take up the cause\" and fight for those who have the power in themselves to change things? You really need to snap out of this \"Victim\" mode. \n \n \n \nIt's called \"profiling\". I am interested to know what frequency you feel \"Blacks\" claim they are being falsely arrested, and what evidence you have that this claim is unfounded.\n\n \n OH, let me tell you about profiling. At the risk of identifying myself (one in a million shot I guess), but I used to work for Customs and have first hand knowledge of targeting. Taken out of context (which it was in the press) it appears to be racist, but read on. Air Jamaica flights were targeted for drugs, and 90% of the people on the flight were Black, and yes, single white females were also targeted (and they DIDN'T complain). But do I need to do the math for you? Naturally, Blacks saw mostly Blacks being searched and immediately screamed racism. Guess what? Air France flights had rich White Americans who were targeted for false declarations. And guess what? No Whites complained, even though Whites were \"profiled\". Other flights were targeted for currency, and those people didn't complain. HMMMMMMMM a disturbing pattern, me thinks\n \n \n Are you talking about Marcus Dixon?\n\n \n YEP, that's the guy! And, wait, don't tell me, he was falsely accused!! Funny, whenever a White guy gets arrested for statutaory rape, I don't hear excuses and accusations.\n \n \n \nMaking money for capitalists and obeying state authority are just not positive qualities in and of themselves to anyone except a fascist.\n\n \n PLEASE tell me you're joking!!! How about making money for yourself and your family and not having to be a slave to the government and stand in line with your hand out begging for more? You really don't see how degrading that is to a human being, but yet you support this for Blacks and other \"oppressed\". And obeying laws so that we all live in a safe society is considered Fascist by you? Teaching your children what's right and what's wrong is a bad thing too, huh? The Black culture, with their treatment of women and making thugs icons and role models, should be the dominant culture today too, I suppose? Sad thing is, it IS taking hold in our youth and look what's happening.\n \n \nI hear you, sugar.\n\n \n I feel the vibes and the connectioon too, cupcake, but we have to fight our feelings for each other LMAO\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTwo ways- \n Copy (Ctrl-C on a pc) and paste (Ctrl-V) the quote, and with the quote selected press the button above that looks like a comic book speech bubble.\n Or put square brackets [] around the word \"quote\" to start a quote section, and do the same thing except with a backslash \"/quote\". You'll see an example if you do the speech-bubble thing.\n \n \n \n \n I don't know what you mean by \"tactics\", but if you felt guilty for the slavery system you would have to have a seriously aggrandized sense of self-importance and responsibility. \n \n \n \n \n What case is this? Please be specific if you are going to reference cases or events, provide a source or a link, or at least a name.\n \n \n In your opinion, and \"that's stupid\" isn't exactly a strong argument. When a state is in the wrong (for example, the Nazi regime to use a simple example), being productively producing ammunition for the Reich and law-abidingly sending your Jewish neighbors to the ovens are not, IMO, qualities of a good person. I tend to value more highly qualities that are useful in any environment, such as compassion, independant thinking, and determination. However, as I said, that is off-topic. \n \n \n Right now it sounds like you're the one who's whining. \n \n How do you know that someone else could not have worked just as hard as you and not have reaped the benefits you have? How do you know they aren't working harder than you and still not getting what you have? I'm sorry, but you're not the only person in the universe who works hard, and most people who really have worked hard in their lives know better than to look down on others who haven't been as lucky as them.\n \n \n Why don't you make a point and I'll address it.

   "Can you site the statitics that show how often the evil White man has hit a Black simply because of their race?\n\n Why? You were given an analogy situation, where a person was \"whining\" because they had been hit by a car, and this was their reason for not being able to show up for work, etc. You said this was understandable, unless they said they were hit because of racism, in which case statictical probability will not help determine whether this person was in fact hit by a car for racist reasons. Questioning, witnesses, etc, would be more helpful. I was wondering why you would believe a person who said they were late because they were hit by a car, but not if they said they were hit by a car because of racism. You did not ask for the statistics on how many people get into car accidents on their way to work.\n \n \nWe could go on and on like this forever, but why do you presume that the person claiming racism is telling the truth?\n\n Well, I tend not to presume that people are lying to me unless they have lied to me repeatedly in the past. I don't think it makes sense to presume that people are lying, and it is especially illogical to presume that people are more likely to lie about racism happening to them than they are to keep incidents of racism to themselves.\n \n \n So, let me get this straight, along with all of my other responsibilities (work, family), I'm supposed to \"take up the cause\" and fight for those who have the power in themselves to change things? You really need to snap out of this \"Victim\" mode. \n\n This is a confusing statement. After all, you also have the power in yourself to change things, and others are already fighting for themselves. You don't have to fight \"for\" anyone else, just not fight against them anymore. The last thing the world needs is some white guy acting like he's going to \"save\" black people, or anyone else but himself for that matter.\n \n \nAnd guess what? No Whites complained, even though Whites were \"profiled\".\n\n Thankfully now they have you to champion them. :xangel\n \n \nFunny, whenever a White guy gets arrested for statutaory rape, I don't hear excuses and accusations.\n\n Well, that doesn't make any sense. None of the white people you've heard of being arrested for statutory rape ever offered an excuse or a defense?\n \n \nPLEASE tell me you're joking!!!\n\n Sorry, can't do that for you.\n \n \n How about making money for yourself and your family and not having to be a slave to the government and stand in line with your hand out begging for more? \n\n It's fine to make money for your family, better than starving of course, but \"making money\" isn't a quality the way, say, \"kindness\" is. Also, that government money belongs to the people, so really it's more like cashing in than \"begging\", and being a \"slave\" to a corporation is no better for the soul.\n \n \nAnd obeying laws so that we all live in a safe society is considered Fascist by you?\n\n That depends on if the laws are making a safe society or if in fact they are simply protecting certain people's interests. I do not obey anyone or anything just because it is a law. I am capable of making moral decisions, such as not murdering people for no reason, without having to consider the legality of that action.\n \n \nThe Black culture, with their treatment of women and making thugs icons and role models, should be the dominant culture today too, I suppose? Sad thing is, it IS taking hold in our youth and look what's happening.\n\n Or, yes, the savage darkies are taking over, with their crazy music and their loose morals... Do you know my grandmother, because you sure do talk like her...\n \n \nI feel the vibes and the connectioon too, cupcake, but we have to fight our feelings for each other LMAO\n\n I know it will be hard for you, but do try to restrain yourself.\n \n \n Not whining, just ticked off that people like you continue to try to make me feel guilty for working while there are people out there who don't and CAN.\n\n I don't see how anyone is trying to make you feel guilty. Guilt is an unhelpful feeling, as it usually accompanies self-deprecation. I am a firm believer in responsibility, though I understand that some people pass get stuck in guilt. In fact, as my family is Catholic, I think I have an extensive knowledge of guilt and guilt-inducement, and it's detrimental effects. I try to stay away from it.\n \n Further, what knowledge do you have access to that you know the details of people's lives enough to judge for them whether or not they are \"capable\" or working? Or even whether or not they do work, regardless of whether it is part of the economy. Not to mention that the economy requires a certain number of people to be unemployed at any given time, there's no sense in hating or looking down on people for that.\n \n \nIf you read what I originally said, the point was that Blacks, if given everyhting that their llittle hearts desired to make up for all the wrongs done to them, would STILL continue to hold slavery and racism over White's heads.\n\n There are several things I don't understand in this statement. One is, what do you mean by \"holding slavery and racism over White's heads\"? Do you mean mentioning slavery and racism? Exploring the history of slavery? Saying that slavery still affects them? Also, do you believe that racism ended with slavery? On what do you base your evaluation of when racism ended?\n \n \n Because, in my oh so humble opinion, you have some sort of sick self hatred of your race and ancestors and willingly accept blame and guilt for immoral things that were done long ago for which neither you or I have any responsibility.\n\n 1- I never said I was white. Evidently your statement that I have a \"sick self hatred of my race and ancestors\" was presuming that I am white. That was a bad assumption on your part. tsk tsk. Besides, I love and honor my ancestors, but I try to learn from their mistakes, not whitewash them or pretend that they were perfect.\n 2- As I said, I don't expect anyone to accept blame or guilt for what is past. The question is, what do we do now?",

   "I would like to draw a parallel between the \"plight\" of the afro-americans today and the \"gay liberation\" movement of the 70s and 80s.\n \n Both the members of the gay liberation movement and the leaders of the black community reject the idea of integration into a normally functioning civil order. \n \n Both groups seem to use charges of prejudice as a weapon.\n \n Both groups have/had the liberals scrambling to ensure social justice is done.\n \n Luckily for the gay liberation movement, their memebers finally grew up before the liberals managed to kill them all off. \n \n Lets look at waht the gay liberation movement led to:\n \n Due to the existance of \"bath houses\", \"glory holes\" and other widely known establishments that gay radicals had dedicated to anonymous public sex, a 1978 survey of gay men revealed that only 14% were in a monogamous relationships. 43% had practiced sex with 500 people, while a third (33%) had over 1000 lifetime sex partners.\n \n \n By the early eighties, the prevelance of syphilis and gonnorrhea were several hundred times more prevelant among gay men than in comparable groups of heterosexuals.\n \n By 1981, 73% of the gay males in san francisco were infected with hepatitis B, whihc not only is fatal in soe cases, but permanantly harms the immune system of infected individuals.\n \n By 1995, over 900,000 were infected with aids, but \"bath houses\" continued to operate.\n \n The big question is, why weren't the bath houses and other public sex establishments closed? Why didn't public health officials target the gay public in regards to education about HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases? With such an epidemic at hand, why didn't the CDC move in and close down these establishments? Why were gays not banned from giving blood (which ended up being the biggest infector of straight folks). Why was mandatory reporting not immediatly instituted, as it is with other epidemics?\n \n Public health officials were leary about approaching the gay community on this issue because they were concerened about being branded as homophobes. The gay liberation movement had made powerful friends in the ACLU and in powerful liberal politicians. They even went so far as to ensure that aids literature from the period did not point to premiscous anal sex as a major means of transmission of the HIV virus (though at the time it was the #1 method of transmission). The liberals insisted on the \"de-gayification\" of aids. Instead of widespread testing programs among the #1 carrier group (as would have been reasonable) and an education campaign aimed at the gay community, we got fliers focusing on the hetereosexual transmission aspects of AIDS.\n \n It seems like the black community in America is in a similar situation. The black community has serious problems that need to be addressed. Violence, crime, lack of education, and drug use are the epidimic in the black community. They have made the same allies in the ACLU and other liberal organizations that the gay liberation movement did. You see liberal politicians just foaming at the mouth to ensure social justice for the blacks. You see folks that suggest that maybe a large portion of the problems the black community has have been self imposed being called racist (as opposed to homophobe).\n \n It seems to me like a replay of the gay liberation fiasco. I have to wonder if the black community in America will manage to pull itself up before it self destructs. I also have to wonder if maybe at some point we as a nation will enable to risk political incorrectness in order to help. \n \n It took the deaths of ONE HELL of a lot of gay men before the gay community, and leaders int he gay community, were willing to face up to the problem and do something about it. I have to wonder how many young black men will have to be killed, or rot away in prison, before the black community, and the leaders of the black community, are willing to open THEIR eyes and make some serious efforts at combating the problems in the black community. \n \n I am sure there are still some incidents of racism in America, but every time somebody is allowed to \"play the race card\", it sets back the cause of black equality. In order to have equality, you have to first BE EQUAL. A black teen who is illiterate, has 4 felony convictions on his record and is addicted to crack is NOT equal to a white kid of the same age who is an honor student. I don't understand why certain people seem to think they should be treated as such. \n \n Affirmative action and racial quotas of today are the same as the \"de-gayification\" of aids. They help to hide the problem as opposed to helping to solve it. Questions such as \"Is White America still in denial concerning the rippling effects of slavery?\" do the same thing.",

   "Mizmaxx,\n I'm not gonna quote that whole analogy gobbledygook that you posted. It's painfully clear that you couldn't concede a point if your life depended on it. No matter what is said, you will go to extraordinary lengths to make excuses for Blacks. I can and will admit that there is racism in the world, an attitude shared by ALL RACES (you STILL won't admit that). \n \n I need to know, do you also have the same pity and sympathy for the Jews? I mean, afterall, they HAVE been persecuted MUCH worse and for a MUCH longer period of time. And since you ARE so compassionate, you certainly would have nothing negative to say about the Jews, right? Also, let me ask you, how do you explain immigrants that arrive here and within a short period of time are successful? Oh wait, I can see it now, it's racism against BLACKS only, huh? WOE IS ME!! Yeah, that argument makes alot of sense- all those racist pigs that are selective toward who they direct their racist beliefs. Yeah, the KKK just LOVES Hispanics, Jews, etc.\n \n \nespecially illogical to presume that people are more likely to lie about racism happening to them than they are to keep incidents of racism to themselves.\n\n \n And now we see what guides you. You are predisposed to believe that because someone screams racism that it MUST be true. You MUST be 16 or something, so gullible and idealistic. It is TOTALLY out of the question that a Black could POSSIBLY be lying about racism.\n \n \nYou don't have to fight \"for\" anyone else, just not fight against them anymore. The last thing the world needs is some white guy acting like he's going to \"save\" black people, or anyone else but himself for that matter.\n \n\n \n First, how can you possibly think that just because I think Blacks should stop crying and just become productive (as in not living off the state) members of society, equates to me fighting against them? Second, you seem to be fighting tooth and nail for them, let them do it themselves through education, perseverance and hard work. I think it's hilarious that someone that finds slavery so appalling (I'm waiting to have this taken out of context) actually supports all this government intervention in their lives, which in turn makes them slaves to the government. Despite your impresion that I'm some evil whit guy, I have more compassion for Blacks than you could fathom. I think it's sad that another human being has to depend so much on others, and much of it is in their control to stop it.\n \n \n \nWell, that doesn't make any sense. None of the white people you've heard of being arrested for statutory rape ever offered an excuse or a defense?\n\n \n DUH, of course they do, but the first thing out of their mouths ISN'T, \"WAAAAAAAAAA, I'M WHITE AND IT'S NOT FAIR WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\"\n \n \n \nAlso, that government money belongs to the people, so really it's more like cashing in than \"begging\",\n\n \n Cashing in for WHO? It's MY money TOO ya know, and if you work and pay taxes, it's YOURS also. It doesn't belong to people that want to live off of others hard work. The money should go back to you, and if you want to feed the world with it, go right ahead and do that, but don't make ME do it.\n \n \nbeing a \"slave\" to a corporation is no better for the soul.\n \n\n \n So, working to earn your paycheck is slavery, but sitting on your lazy butt and getting a check from the government isn't? I'm sorry, you aren't 16, try 13 maybe. And by the way, do you take your allowance and buy things? Be careful now, you ARE contributing to that EVIL corporation. Wait, careful what you put in your mouth, that came from an EVIL corporation. Uh oh, better not call your friends, that EVIL corporation again. And MTV, that network that you just can't get enough of? YEP, you got it, another EVIL corporation.\n \n \nThat depends on if the laws are making a safe society or if in fact they are simply protecting certain people's interests. I do not obey anyone or anything just because it is a law. I am capable of making moral decisions, such as not murdering people for no reason, without having to consider the legality of that action.\n \n\n \n Name me ONE law (that those of us who AREN'T attorneys would know of) that is in ONE particular groups interests. And this XXXX about not obeying a law just because it's a law PROVES you are 13-going through a stage, huh? Plain old common sense (which you MAY get some when you grow up) dictates that laws need to be followed, whether we like them or not. GEEEEEEEEEEEZ, I'm catching on here. You want the government to give people money (like your allowance), but you don't like to obey authority (like momy and daddy telling you what to do)\n \n \nOr, yes, the savage darkies are taking over, with their crazy music and their loose morals... Do you know my grandmother, because you sure do talk like her...\n\n \n Well, we COULD begin a whole new thread dealing with the decline of society and how it correlates to the Whites assuaging some collective guilt (thank youLiberals, so very much) that we shouldn't feel in the first place, letting 13% of the population dominate our poilitics and culture... Tell me, in the Black culture of today, what is there to be so proud of? It's WHITE to be smart and educated (and don't EVEN try to defend this, it's a fact, they think it, we've all heard them say it), it's WHITE to submit to the authority (DON'T, they break bad on purpose because it is WHITE to go willingly), thugs are idolized, rappers killing each other (any rock stars done that? could be, just asking), women treated like XXXX, breeding like rabbits with no responsibility...and the list could go on and on. By the way, it would be an HONOR to know your grandmother!\n \n \nNot to mention that the economy requires a certain number of people to be unemployed at any given time,\n \n \n\n \n GOOD, so you'll be voting for Bush then. WAIT, not old enough yet, sorry!\n \n \nI know it will be hard for you, but do try to restrain yourself.\n\n \n yep, I don't want to get charged with staturoy rape, would I? WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA it's a set up because I'm an angry White guy WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA LMAO\n \n \nThere are several things I don't understand in this statement. One is, what do you mean by \"holding slavery and racism over White's heads\"? Do you mean mentioning slavery and racism? Exploring the history of slavery? Saying that slavery still affects them? Also, do you believe that racism ended with slavery? On what do you base your evaluation of when racism ended?\n\n \n When people like you continue to throw slavery in Whites faces, you betch that is an attempt (which works on far too many) to make people feel guilty. Explore the history of slavery and you'll find that the Blacks rounded up their own race and sold them to the evil White man. And how is it possible that slavery can stil affect those who were not slaves? Of course racism didn't end with slavery, it still exists today (remember, you are dealing with a racist pig here), but not NEARLY to the extent they claim. A Black could walk into almost any \"all white\" establishment and not fear for his life. If I go into an \"all Black\" establishment? They wouldn't find my body for months, if at all. It's obvious that you would be thrilled to have the government get inside our heads and make all bad thoughts a crime\n \n \nI never said I was white. Evidently your statement that I have a \"sick self hatred of my race and ancestors\" was presuming that I am white.\n\n \n You are right, bad assumption on my part. See I can concede a point, can you? And I AM sorry for insulting you like that, calling you White and all",

   "In what way did I imply that black people are inferior to white people?\n\n That would be when you said that Black people were not equal to White people- \"In order to have equality, you have to first BE EQUAL.\" \n \n \nI do not feel that White America is still in denial concerning the \"rippling effects of slavery\". I feel that the \"rippling effects of slavery\" are non-existant. I also feel that by trying to determine/rectify the non-existant \"rippling effects of slavery\", the black community is being harmed.\n\n Although expressing your feelings is apparently a really healthy thing to do, this is a debate forum, and so perhaps not the appropriate place for it. In a debate, you make an argument, offering support based on logic and evidence. \n \n \nI'm not gonna quote that whole analogy gobbledygook that you posted.\n\n I'm sorry you couldn't understand my post. Perhaps I was unclear. Here is the sequence of events (in shorthand paraphrase)-\n \n 1. You said \"people should take responsiblity and stop blaming outside events for their problems\"\n 2. I said \"what about when the outside event is the problem, like if someone misses work because they got hit by a car\"\n 3. You said \"that's fine, so long as they don't say the car hit them because of racism\"\n 4. I said \"how do you know the car didn't hit them because of racism?\"\n 5. You said \"what is the statistical probability of getting hit by a car because of racism? And how do you know it was racism?\"6. I said \"the statistical probability is irrelevant to whether your employee got hit by a car because of racism. And I believe that the cause is racism for the same reason that I believe the person got hit by a car. Why do you evalute the honesty of the statements \"I got hit by a car\" and \"it was because of racism\" differently, assuming honesty in one case but presuming dishonesty in the other?\n \n So, now can you answer the question of why you did not ask for statistical evidence (no matter how irrelevant it may be) that an employee could get hit by a car on their way to work (in fact you asked nothing at all, presuming this to be true), but you presume the opposite in the case of saying that the car accident's cause was racism?\n \n \nAlso, let me ask you, how do you explain immigrants that arrive here and within a short period of time are successful? Oh wait, I can see it now, it's racism against BLACKS only, huh?\n\n Not all Jewish people are \"successful\". In the case of \"other immigrants\", I presume by your later statement that you mean other people of color, such as latino/a people. Evidently, people from these communities are also subject to racism, and as with Black people, few of them are lucky enough to escape from the associated poverty.\n \n \nYou are predisposed to believe that because someone screams racism that it MUST be true. You MUST be 16 or something, so gullible and idealistic. It is TOTALLY out of the question that a Black could POSSIBLY be lying about racism.\n\n You are incredibly presumptuous. I merely stated that it is illogical to presume that a person is lying about racism more than they would hide it's effects. It's illogical because you base this assumption on nothing. When called on it, you have nothing else but to resort to name-calling. I think you should know, there are whole threads which can inform you on logic and debating tactics. I think you will find them very helpful.\n \n \nSecond, you seem to be fighting tooth and nail for them, let them do it themselves through education, perseverance and hard work. \n\n I think you have an inaccurate idea of what \"fighting tooth and nail\" looks like. I also would like to see you present some evidence that Black communities are not, and haven't always, been actively fighting tooth and nail for themselves with \"education, perseverence and hard worlk\".\n \n \nI think it's sad that another human being has to depend so much on others, and much of it is in their control to stop it.\n\n How very sensitive of you. However, Black people don't need your pity.\n \n \n DUH, of course they do, but the first thing out of their mouths ISN'T, \"WAAAAAAAAAA, I'M WHITE AND IT'S NOT FAIR WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\"\n\n How do you know? In passing, that sounds like a great title for your post.\n \n \nThe money should go back to you, and if you want to feed the world with it, go right ahead and do that, but don't make ME do it.\n\n Well, if you don't like it, why don't you vote or something? Isn't that how you think change happens? You believe you live in a democracy, right? So obviously, the people have spoken, quitcherbitchin.\n \n \n So, working to earn your paycheck is slavery, but sitting on your lazy butt and getting a check from the government isn't? I'm sorry, you aren't 16, try 13 maybe.\n\n Amusing though your rants are, it doesn't improve your position to refuse to put forth any evidence to support your position. Just keep making ad hominem attacks, and it gets more and more obvious that you have no logical or factual backing for your position.\n \n \nName me ONE law (that those of us who AREN'T attorneys would know of) that is in ONE particular groups interests.\n\n The illegality of loitering. In any case, that is irrelevant. The point is that law is not infallible.\n \n \nAnd this XXXX about not obeying a law just because it's a law PROVES you are 13-going through a stage, huh? Plain old common sense (which you MAY get some when you grow up) dictates that laws need to be followed, whether we like them or not.\n\n I suggest you re-evaluate your definition of \"proof\". I also hope for your sake that you do not actually follow this absurd tenet. Driving beside you must be incredibly dangerous, as you never go over the speed limit despite the speed of the cars around you. I'm sure when you turned in your friends every time they made illegal copies of cds, tapes, etc., you felt extremely validated and morally superior. I can see why you would not understand something so complex as racism, as you are morally at elementary-school level according to Kohlberg's stages of morality development. Perhaps you are edging into stage 2, with your statement regarding taxes and welfare (ie, \"I don't wanna share!\").\n \n \nBy the way, it would be an HONOR to know your grandmother!\n\n How kind. Maybe you should get together to discuss the decline of white values caused by racial mixing, and the annoyance of having to deal with Jewish people whining about the holocaust- which clearly didn't happen.\n \n I hope you are young enough to have time to grow as a human being and become more honest and courageous than my grandmother will, as she will probably die having refused to learn virtually anything in her lifetime.\n \n If you don't feel like visiting the trailer parks between Saratoga and Albany, try instead the KKK and Heritage Front website forums, where I'm sure your little theories will be much more appreciated.\n \n \nAnd how is it possible that slavery can stil affect those who were not slaves?\n\n It's probably far too complicated for you to understand, so I guess you're right in not bothering to try.\n \n \nOf course racism didn't end with slavery, it still exists today (remember, you are dealing with a racist pig here), but not NEARLY to the extent they claim.\n\n This is a good example of a statement which is useless in a debate. Put forth an example of what \"they\" claim, define who \"they\" are, and find evidence that it is not true.\n \n \nIt's obvious that you would be thrilled to have the government get inside our heads and make all bad thoughts a crime\n\n Just because voices in your head tell you something doesn't make it true.",

You made numerous statements in your post which you did not back up, and these require proofs. Let me break this down for you-\n \n \n Both the members of the gay liberation movement and the leaders of the black community reject the idea of integration into a normally functioning civil order.\n \n Both groups seem to use charges of prejudice as a weapon.\n \n Both groups have/had the liberals scrambling to ensure social justice is done.\n\n Three statements. No proof.\n \n \nLets look at waht (sic) the gay liberation movement led to:\n \n Due to the existance of \"bath houses\"(...)\n\n This section is non causa pro causa- you haven't demonstated that there is a causal homosexual-promiscuity/AIDS connection, yet you use this as proof for your tenet.\n \n \nWhy was mandatory reporting not immediatly (...) instituted, as it is with other epidemics?\n\n Because no one in power cared that a bunch of fags were dying. Had they done so, the pandemic could have been brought under control quickly. You contention that this was due to \"fear\" that the population in question would view this as discriminatory holds no water. Groups of \"PWAs\" (People With AIDS, or HIV positive people) were requesting action on the part of the government and heath care providers for years, and no action was taken. Clearly the gov't w\n ould not have feared being labeled as discriminatory for doing what a small group of mostly homeless gay male drug users were requesting. From the Denver Principles in June 1983, to Act Up's response to Reagan finally addressing AIDS in 1987 (where he did not once mention h-hh-homosekshuls), gay activists were spreading the word, and encouraging condom use and safer sex.\n \n \nInstead of widespread testing programs among the #1 carrier group (as would have been reasonable) and an education campaign aimed at the gay community, we got fliers focusing on the hetereosexual transmission aspects of AIDS.\n\n I don't know what your experience in gay communities is, but there were many many many educational campaigns about AIDS and HIV aimed at gay men in the gay community of my city. From the beginning, as I said, the only people who would even discuss this problem were gay activists, such as ACT UP.\n \n \nSimilarly, the discovery of cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules in the Chicago area in October 1982 prompted a huge spate of press coverage. The New York Times covered the story every day of October, and then ran 23 more stories in November and December. In the end, seven people died from the capsules.\n \n By contrast, The New York Times published only three stories on AIDS in 1981, and only three more in all of 1982, none of which were on page one. Yet by the time of the Tylenol poisonings, 260 Americans had died of AIDS, and 374 more had been diagnosed. Similar disparities in news coverage exist for several other health scares of the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n \nmore here\n \n \nBy 1984, I had been fighting epidemics around the world for 14 years, and had a very bad feeling of what was to come with HIV-1. With that fear, I designed a prevention program that, in retrospect, was very limited. Yet, with a cost of just under $40M, the administration in Washington choked. The message I got was, \"CDC should look pretty and do as little as possible.\"\n \n The writing was on the wall and CDC, the world's leader in preventive medicine, was ordered to do essentially nothing. With CDC not in the lead, it was every community left to fend for itself. With such a background, it is not surprising that we are still arguing about needle exchange, harm reduction for drug users, HIV reporting, partner notification, etc., etc. The CDC, the nation and many communities have never recovered.\nDonald Francis \n \n \n It took the deaths of ONE HELL of a lot of gay men before the gay community, and leaders int he gay community, were willing to face up to the problem and do something about it.\n\n What do you base statements like this on? The opposite is true, see above.\n \n \nI have to wonder how many young black men will have to be killed,{clip} blah blah blah {clip} Questions such as \"Is White America still in denial concerning the rippling effects of slavery?\" do the same thing.\n\n Tons of dramatic statements, no evidence given.",

   "Why do you evalute the honesty of the statements \"I got hit by a car\" and \"it was because of racism\" differently, assuming honesty in one case but presuming dishonesty in the other?\n\n \n LOL, well, maybe because one can be proven and the other not. Just because a White hits a Black by accident, does not mean it's racial, but a Black can EASILY claim that without ANY proof. Ya know, I was walking out of a store the other day, right behinda Black guy and he just let that door slam in my face. RACISM?\n \n \nIn the case of \"other immigrants\", I presume by your later statement that you mean other people of color, such as latino/a people.\n\n \n HMMMMMMMM I thought you said somewhere that I was so presumtuous. Why do you immdeiately assume I was referring to \"people of color\"? Would you include Asians in that group? Indians? They seem to come over here and do quite well, but they aren't counted by you because of their success?\n \n \nsubject to racism, and as with Black people, few of them are lucky enough to escape from the associated poverty.\n \n\n \n okay, now if ALL minorities (I shouldn't say all, because YOU seem to think that only the poor Blacks are victims) are victims of racism, and racism is what keeps them down, you are saying that it is LUCK that some have escaped poverty? Just hit the right numbers, huh? \n \n \nI think you should know, there are whole threads which can inform you on logic and debating tactics. I think you will find them very helpful.\n \n\n \n No doubt write by you LOL. If I'm not mitaken, I provided you a perfect example a few posts ago that addressed Blacks accusations against Customs of being racist, but other races ALSO being \"profiled\" not saying a word. Firsthand knowledge and experience, not some stupid studies by pointy heads who are trying to suport THEIR beliefs. You failed to address that, other than to say that thank God I am their to champion them (whatever THAT is supposed to mean). So please, go back and re read these tactics of which you speak.\n \n \nI think you have an inaccurate idea of what \"fighting tooth and nail\" looks like.\n\n \n Well, for starters, when a point is made, concede it. You would rather see me as a racist than as someone who actually is concerned about another human being and their self-respect. I greatly admire and respect Blacks who have become successful on their own, like so many Whites do (uh oh, there's that privilege thing again). Now, would the Grand Dragon (or whoever) of the KKK say or believe that? I believe the assassination of MLK was a terrible thing-he wanted what I want, but now we have jerk-offs that \"lead\" the Black community purely out of self-interest, and they follow like sheep.\n \n \nI also would like to see you present some evidence that Black communities are not, and haven't always, been actively fighting tooth and nail for themselves with \"education, perseverence and hard worlk\".\n \n\n \n You make oh so many requests, but I see none from you. And I say again, there are many Blacks who are very sccessful and educated, and I salute them. The others need to do the same. I also need to throw in here that I feel the same about Whites who sit on their lazy butts as well, whining and crying. Maybe I should have made all that clear to you from the beginning-not that you would have believed me.\n \n \nHow very sensitive of you. However, Black people don't need your pity.\n\n \n Well, pity and my money, sorry\n \n \nHow do you know? In passing, that sounds like a great title for your post.\n\n \n This, in reference to how Whites don't scream racism when arrested. Good come back! You know as well as I do they don't, but that's a point you can't concede. And IF they do, then those journalists you so adore aren't doing their job. Or are they? Does the word agenda come to mind?\n \n \nWell, if you don't like it, why don't you vote or something? Isn't that how you think change happens? You believe you live in a democracy, right? So obviously, the people have spoken, quitcherbitchin.\n\n \n LMAO, where do I begin with THIS one? I can't recall what you posted this in responose to, but it MUST have been a point. UMMMMMMMM, I have a feeling you are also for abortion, but yet the people HAVEN'T spoken on that issue. But I'm sure in your eyes it was okay for activist judges to make it \"legal\". I'm stopping here, not enough time in the day LOL\n \n \nThe illegality of loitering. In any case, that is irrelevant. The point is that law is not infallible.\n \n\n \n Perhaps the most obvious case yet of your inability to support anything that YOU say. You made a statement, I asked you for examples, you give one with no explanation and then dismiss it as irrelevant. The point was NOT that law was infallible, you were making a feable attempt at portaying the law as racist and fell flat on your face.\n \n Anyway, some other questions I'll ask of you (though I won't expect a response, haven't gotten any from you regarding other questions I've asked):\n \n Do you believe that since Blacks are 13% of the population, that they should receive the same proportion in benefits (i.e. jobs, school enrollmet)? Can you name me a country run by Blacks that has any degree of control and civilized behavior (I hear your response now, define this, define that, by whose standards)? Simple question \n \n \nI hope you are young enough to have time to grow as a human being and become more honest and courageous than my grandmother will, as she will probably die having refused to learn virtually anything in her lifetime.\n\n \n LMAO your parents are from the 60's, aren't they? Only YOU know the truth, right, and everyone else that does't agree with you is ignorant and uneducated. If I'm not mistaken, the only thing I have really accused you of is being idealistic and gullible, far from what you are inferring about me (and your granmother). And when you grow up and have kids, I'd love to hear what you have to say about all this then (referring to society and it's downfall)\n \n \nThis is a good example of a statement which is useless in a debate. Put forth an example of what \"they\" claim, define who \"they\" are, and find evidence that it is not true.\n \n\n \n AHHHHHHHHHH they have eyes and yet they do not see!

   "Your meaning is clear. You are saying that Black people are inferior. Why you think they are inferior, what you think they do that makes them inferior in your opinion, is irrelevant. \n\n \n I said \"A black teen who is illiterate, has 4 felony convictions on his record and is addicted to crack is NOT equal to a white kid of the same age who is an honor student. I don't understand why certain people seem to think they should be treated as such.\"\n \n I see the problem now. You are working on the assumtion that ALL black teens are illiterate criminals who are addicted to crack. They are not. A lot of them are good kids. It is the ones who are illiterate criminals and drug addicts that we need to work on. Of course, a white teen who is an illiterate crimainal and a drug addict ALSO would not be equal to a white teen who is an honor student.\n \n You are either looking for something that isn't there (a racist angle in my post), or you have fallen back to the old liberal standby of diverting attention from the argument by calling me a racist homophobe. \n \n \n \nPerhaps you forgot the part where within that argument you had to actually present logical or factual proofs for your statements...\n \n \n So you want me to cite my sources, is that it? What exacly would you like me to cite sources for? Pls be specific, there are close to 2 dozen sources I drew from in that particular posting. \n \n \nMaking an analogy is not an argument in and of itself, daewoo. You made numerous statements in your post which you did not back up, and these require proofs. Let me break this down for you-\n \n \n You are certainly correct on this one, which is why you would have to look at the analogy in context with other postings on the thread.\n \n \nThree statements. No proof.\n Originally Posted by daewoo\n Both the members of the gay liberation movement and the leaders of the black community reject the idea of integration into a normally functioning civil order.\n \n Both groups seem to use charges of prejudice as a weapon.\n \n Both groups have/had the liberals scrambling to ensure social justice is done. \n \n \n \"It is not the responsibilty of Black Americans to integrate into American society. It is the responsibility of society to eveolve to accept Black Americans\"----Rev Jesse Jackson\n \n The second one is one of the questions we are debating, as such, a personal belief on the argument is warranted. You and I also both know that something along this line is almost impossible to \"prove\". I acn offer a quote from a well respected Gay journalist Gabriel Rotello \"[public health officials] feared that by focusing on the diseases spawned by the gay sexual revolution they would be accused of homophobia. Gay leaders freuently made it plain to researchers that anyone who raised questions about gay sexual freedom for any reason, whethr ethical or biological, would be equally accused of anti-gay bias.\"\n \n The third issue is pretty much proven by the fact that we are even reponding to a thread like this. \n \n \n \nLets look at waht (sic) the gay liberation movement led to:\n \n Due to the existance of \"bath houses\"(...) \n \n This section is non causa pro causa- you haven't demonstated that there is a causal homosexual-promiscuity/AIDS connection, yet you use this as proof for your tenet.\n \n \n First, would you quite using non causa pro causa in this manner. Non causa pro causa refers to a logical fallacy or citing the one event as the cause of another when the required connection between the two events would need laws of nature that are not generally accepted. An exaple would be \"I did not wear my lucky tie today, so I failed the test\" or \"More police on the street leads to more crime. When whateverville increased the number of police ont he street, the number of crimes observed went up.\"\n \n The basic tenant of non causa pro causa does NOT refer to not proving the validity of either side of a comparison, unless challenged. Generally, challenging the comparison is considered to be the responsibilty of hte opposing debater. Quite shoving your work off on me. If you can't show the comparison to be an invalid one, I am no longer going to go back and take pains to clarify for you. If you can come up with a reason that the comparison meets the requirements of the non causa pro causa label, feel free to use the phrase. I think you use this in debates when you have no arghument, and you are hoping that by citing obscure, impressive sounding principals you can intimedate your opponent\n \n \n Maybe you should have read the next bit, where I said:\n \n \na 1978 survey of gay men revealed that only 14% were in a monogamous relationships. 43% had practiced sex with 500 people, while a third (33%) had over 1000 lifetime sex partners.\n \n By the early eighties, the prevelance of syphilis and gonnorrhea were several hundred times more prevelant among gay men than in comparable groups of heterosexuals.\n \n By 1981, 73% of the gay males in san francisco were infected with hepatitis B, whihc not only is fatal in soe cases, but permanantly harms the immune system of infected individuals.\n \n By 1995, over 900,000 were infected with aids, but \"bath houses\" continued to operate.\n \n \n \n Are you really going to try to argue that promiscuity does not spread STD's? Or that the 900,000 homosexuals who has aids in 1995 got it through abstinance? Gay men accounted for fully 80% of known cases of HIV infection in 1995. If this was not the result of promiscuity, perhaps you would care to enlighten us as to how this occured. Perhaps god just hated them? Maybe it was a government experiment? I personally am going to stick with the \"STD's are caused by promiscuity\" line. \n \n \n \nBecause no one in power cared that a bunch of fags were dying. Had they done so, the pandemic could have been brought under control quickly. You contention that this was due to \"fear\" that the population in question would view this as discriminatory holds no water. Groups of \"PWAs\" (People With AIDS, or HIV positive people) were requesting action on the part of the government and heath care providers for years, and no action was taken. \n \n I don't know what your experience in gay communities is, but there were many many many educational campaigns about AIDS and HIV aimed at gay men in the gay community of my city. From the beginning, as I said, the only people who would even discuss this problem were gay activists, such as ACT UP.\n \n \n \n \n Again, see the above quote from the gay journalist. \n \n \"We didnt intervene because we felt that it would be interfering with an alternative lifestyle\" Don Francis (CDC) \n \n \"The phenomenology of a sex club encounter is an experience of worl making. It's an experience of being connected not just to this person, but to potentially limitless limitless numbers of people, that's why it's important to be with a stranger.\" Michael Warner, gay activist\n \n \"Us officials had no alternative but to negotiate the course of AIDS policy with representatives of a well organised gay community and their allies in the medical and political establishment. In this process, many of the traditional practices of public health that might have been brought to bear were dismissed as inappropriate.\" Ronald Bayer, Columbia University, SPH\n \n As late as 1995, with 900,000 infested individuals, the board of New York Gay Mens Health Crisis still opposed closing bath houses, despite the fact that studies conducted in the mid 80s showed a strong connection to the public sex establishments and the practice of unsafe sex practices.\n \n The same board (NYGMHC) warned that closing the public sex houses would drive the problem underground. Besides being ufounded, this was a thinly veiled threat to government helath worker: If governemts officials attempted to persue traditional public health policies, they would loose the support of the political leadership of the gay community. \n \n When officials tried to institute screening processes for the national blood supply, and asked that homosexuals not donate until the epidemic had passed, political leaders denounced the move on the grounds that it infringed homosexuals \"right\" to give blood. The San Francisco coordinating commitee for gay and lesbian services issued a policy paper asserting that donor screening was \"reminiscent of miscegenation blood laws that divided black blood from white\" and \"similar in concept to the WWII round up of Japanese-Americans in the western half of the country to minimize the possibilty of espionage.\"\n \n Do I really need to keep giving examples, or have you gotten the point by now? I really could do this all day, except that I have some meetings I have to get to. \n \n Also, while I have your attention, do you want statistics regarding my statement about lack of education, crime, and drug use are epidemics in the black community? They are much simpler to come by. Do me a favor and google it, if you can't find figures that support that, let me know.\n \n Also, could you seperate replies to different posters, as opposed to clumping them all together? It makes the thread easier to follow.",

   "LOL, well, maybe because one can be proven and the other not.\n\n You don't believe that racist intent can ever be proven?\n \n \nWhy do you immdeiately assume I was referring to \"people of color\"? \n\n Because given the argument, it doesn't really make sense for you to say that white immigrants do fine compared to Black immigrants. \n \n \nWould you include Asians in that group? Indians? They seem to come over here and do quite well, but they aren't counted by you because of their success?\n\n Asians and Indians? If don't mean Native people (which I presume because you said \"immigrants), then \"Indians\" means I guess South Asians? Last time I looked at a map, India was in Asia...\n \n As to the later statement \"they seem to come over here and do quite well\", this is another example of unproved meaningless generalizations. Besides, I do include South and East Asians when I say \"people of colour\".\n \n \n okay, now if ALL minorities (clip) are victims of racism, and racism is what keeps them down, you are saying that it is LUCK that some have escaped poverty?\n\n You're starting to get it now. Bravo. Except for the fact that the word \"minority\" isn't really accurate.\n \n \nFirsthand knowledge and experience, not some stupid studies by pointy heads who are trying to suport (sic) THEIR beliefs. You failed to address that, other than to say that thank God I am their (sic) to champion them.\n\n Unfortunately for you, in a debate, statements by \"pointy heads\" are considered valid evidence for consideration. Your \"firsthand\" experience is called the fallacy of \"hasty generalization\". Likewise, I could just give examples of racism that I have seen and argue that these apply in every case.\n \n \nWell, for starters, when a point is made, concede it.\n\n Maybe if you had been around these boards longer you would realize that I readily concede error on my part. If I have made an error.\n \n \nI greatly admire and respect Blacks who have become successful on their own, like so many Whites do (uh oh, there's that privilege thing again). Now, would the Grand Dragon (or whoever) of the KKK say or believe that?\n\n Um, yes. At least, individual members do. \n \n \nSometimes people think that the KKK doesn't like black people. They think that people in the KKK don't know any black people and so that is why they don't like them. But that is not true.\n \n Members of the KKK live all over the country. Some of them go to school with black people or work with black people. Just because a person is in the KKK doesn't mean they don't like any black people.(...)\n Yes, there are black people and other races of people who are very nice people. They work hard and try to help their families. They tell the black kids not to get on drugs. They want them to get good grades and to get jobs.\n\n How nice. emoticon_rolleyes Unfortunately, the belief that there are some 'good' black people does not mean that you are not racist. If you want the link to this genius' entire post, PM me. I don't want to give him any more audience than necessary.\n \n Look, I get it. You figure that racists aren't \"nice people\", but you're a nice guy, so how could you be racist? Except for the fact is that what you are saying is exactly the same think racist white people have been saying for centuries about Black people. Sorry, but your words speak what your heart is full of.\n \n \n The point was NOT that law was infallible, you were making a feable attempt at portaying the law as racist and fell flat on your face.\n\n You'll have to quote me where I said that. I thought we were talking about the fact that I said that being \"productive and law-abiding\" weren't necessarily good things. Laws aren't infallible, you have to think for yourself.\n \n \n Do you believe that since Blacks are 13% of the population, that they should receive the same proportion in benefits (i.e. jobs, school enrollmet)? \n\n People should receive what they need.\n \n \nCan you name me a country run by Blacks that has any degree of control and civilized behavior (I hear your response now, define this, define that, by whose standards)?\n \n Well, of course I'm going to ask you to define things, you're asking me an absurd question. However, going on the assumption that by \"civilized\" you mean \"has large cities\", and by \"control\" you mean \"hierarchical power structure\", several come to mind. Most notably, Ancient Egypt. As for contemporary examples- Trinidad, which I know of because I have several friends from there. I'm sure there are others. This is, of course, a pointless question. Chaos exists all over the world, in \"white-run\" countries as much as anywhere else. Not to mention that your standards of cultural evaluation are laughable. \n \n Why, do you believe that Black people are somehow magically unable to be as hierarchical and urban as White people? Strange proposal, as many of these traditions existance in \"white\" cultures are due to the influence of Egypt. \n \n \n And when you grow up and have kids, I'd love to hear what you have to say about all this then (referring to society and it's downfall)\n\n How do you know I don't have kids? This is also a strange proposal, do you believe now that reproduction makes one more racist? I'd like to see you prove that.\n \n \nPut forth an example of what \"they\" claim, define who \"they\" are, and find evidence that it is not true.\n \n Go on then, your turn.",

   "I see the problem now. You are working on the assumtion that ALL black teens are illiterate criminals who are addicted to crack. They are not. A lot of them are good kids. It is the ones who are illiterate criminals and drug addicts that we need to work on. Of course, a white teen who is an illiterate crimainal and a drug addict ALSO would not be equal to a white teen who is an honor student.\n\n If that is what you believe, then instead of saying that Black people aren't equal, why don't you say that \"illiterate criminals and drug users\" aren't equal, and leave race out of it?\n \n \nSo you want me to cite my sources, is that it? What exacly would you like me to cite sources for? Pls be specific, there are close to 2 dozen sources I drew from in that particular posting.\n\n Start with one. Then write the next one. Repeat. \n \n \n\"It is not the responsibilty of Black Americans to integrate into American society. It is the responsibility of society to eveolve to accept Black Americans\"----Rev Jesse Jackson\n\n That doesn't preclude \"a normally functioning civil order.\"\n \n \nYou and I also both know that something along this line is almost impossible to \"prove\". \n\n Well, perhaps you should stick to statements you can prove. \n \n \nI acn offer a quote from a well respected Gay journalist Gabriel Rotello \"[public health officials] feared that by focusing on the diseases spawned by the gay sexual revolution they would be accused of homophobia. Gay leaders freuently made it plain to researchers that anyone who raised questions about gay sexual freedom for any reason, whethr ethical or biological, would be equally accused of anti-gay bias.\"\n[/quote]\n So, despite the calls from the gay community to act, and despite the fact that the Reagan administration was in all other cases unconcerned with being seen as homophobic, despite the fact that Reagan sent word down to the CDC that nothing should be done, you believe that it was fear of being called homophobic that prevented action on the government's part? \n \n I'd like to know where you got that quote, was it from Sexual Ecology? I doubt you got it on-line, as your version is so full of typos. I would like to see the context.\n \n \nThe third issue is pretty much proven by the fact that we are even reponding to a thread like this.\n\n Or not... \n \n \n First, would you quite using non causa pro causa in this manner. Non causa pro causa refers to a logical fallacy or citing the one event as the cause of another when the required connection between the two events would need laws of nature that are not generally accepted. \n\n Are you arguing that it is a generally accepted law of nature that HIV chooses hosts on the basis that they are gay or promiscuous? I was under the belief that acquiring HIV only required contact through one person, regardless of their sexual orientation.\n \n Similarly, I don't think that it is a generally accepted law of nature that Black people are stupid and lazy.\n \n \nI personally am going to stick with the \"STD's are caused by promiscuity\" line. \n\n Fine, tell that to medical science. They'll tell you that STDs are either bacterial or viral infections, and you only have to have sexual contact with one person to get them.\n \n \nBesides being ufounded, this was a thinly veiled threat to government helath worker: If governemts officials attempted to persue traditional public health policies, they would loose the support of the political leadership of the gay community. \n\n Not at all unfounded, or \"ufounded\". Or a threat. Shutting down Bath Houses would not have helped, handing out free condoms would have.\n \n \nAlso, while I have your attention, do you want statistics regarding my statement about lack of education, crime, and drug use are epidemics in the black community? \n These things all accompany poverty. Unless you can prove that these exist in the case of Black communities because of some flaw that Black people have...\n \n If you like statistics, see my thread the Myth of Color-Blind America. \n African Americans with a college diploma find themselves unemployed almost twice as often as whites with the same education. Hispanics must get by on only about half of the individual income that Asian Americans and whites divvy up among the bills.\n \n \n And when blacks and Latinos are hospitalized with a heart problem, they are less likely than European Americans to receive catheterization, be sent home with beta blockers, or even be advised to take aspirin to protect their health.\n \n \n While many Americans agree that open racial bigotry is generally a thing of the past, stark disparities in daily life persist, as documented by academic researchers, the U.S. Census Bureau and the Institute of Medicine.\n \n Enjoy!",

Similarly, I don't think that it is a generally accepted law of nature that Black people are stupid and lazy..\n\n \n No, I am arguing that you have no idea what non causa pro causa actually means. \n \n \nFine, tell that to medical science. They'll tell you that STDs are either bacterial or viral infections, and you only have to have sexual contact with one person to get them.\n\n \n I will revise my statement to clarify it for you. STD's reach epidemic proportions though sexual promiscuity. Promiscuity is having sex with more than one partner, so it could be argued that promiscusity IS the cause of the spread of STDs period. Since if none of us had sex with more than one partner, ever, they would not spread. Of course, this would make the college years very boring.\n \n \nNot at all unfounded, or \"ufounded\". Or a threat. Shutting down Bath Houses would not have helped, handing out free condoms would have.\n\n \n AND THEY DID. According to the CDC, they funded the distrobution of over 5 MILLION condoms.

There is no organizational mandate cited, no speech or declaration to uphold his opinion that it was \"political correctness\", instead of homophobia, which contributed to the spread of AIDS. \n \n I also question your description of him as a \"well-respected gay journalist\", as this a) means nothing, and b) would be more accurately said \"right-wing journalist\". A \"well-hated\" and widely considered \"sell-out and gay Uncle Tom\" might be another way to describe him, but again these are just opinions. Note that Rotello doesn't say (that I have seen), that XXXXX communities didn't respond to AIDS, or respond quickly enough, but that they did/do not follow his preferred method of response- that is, to close down any and all gay sex meeting places, and reject every type of relationship save monogamous relationships.\n \n If you would like to read a book written by someone who was actually part of AIDS activism through it's history, this book would be a good idea, \"Beyond Shame: Reclaiming the Abandoned History of Radical Gay Sexuality\" Patrick Alan Moore, ISBN: 0807079561.",

I know you hate the word, but by civilized, I mean a society that has laws that are obeyed by the majority of society. I mean a society that has a respect for human life. I mean a society that strives to become better. And yes, your definition of control suits me just fine, except I would add in a STABLE hierarchical power structure. Okay, Trinidad...I guess you got me there LMAO. Now, as far as Egypt goes, I know this is splitting hairs, but you are certainly no stranger to that...but, I think MOST people consider Egyptians to be people of Middle Eastern descent. They certainly do not classify themselves as Black. SO, when you pick Egypt as an example, you make my point. May I reference South Africa? A country with a VERY high standard of living compared to the rest of Africa (I can hear it now, \"by whose standards\"), handed to Blacks on a silver platter, and STILL not able to make it a success.\n \n \n \n MAN, it just would kill you to admit that Whites have done anything good in this world, wouldn't it?\n \n \n \n Nope, just more realistic.\n\n \n \n Dude, you have won. There is no point arguing with some people, because they are so closed minded that there is just no getting through. Oddly enugh, they are generally the folks that consider themselves to be the most open minded. \n \n No point to beating a dead horse.

   "Absent a thorough background investigation on the White guy that reveals he has a long history of such actions, no, there is no way to prove racist intent.\n\n There's no way to disprove racist intent then either. Besides, the person still got hit by a car. Or would you also doubt that?\n \n \nFor MOST people with half a brain, my Asian reference was for Orientals (but now you'll demand a listing of which particulat Orientals, OR I'll be ripped a new one because that isn't a PC term.

Why don't you just say Chinks, if that's what you mean?\n \n I'm not concerned so much about the terms you use as the way you use them. Most people don't care how they are referred to when people aren't being @ssholes. However, if you are going \n to stereotype people, you might want to know a thing or two about them first. Such as what continent they originate from. \n \n \nNo, I don't think you do, but you'll say it now to appear all-sensitive.\n\n LOL! As if you would know.... \n \n \nYou said several posts back that laws are made in the interests of one particular group.\n\n You are obviously confused. Next time, check that I actually said something first, it will help you save face.\n \n \nAnd obeying laws so that we all live in a safe society is considered Fascist by you?\n\n \nThat depends on if the laws are making a safe society or if in fact they are simply protecting certain people's interests. I do not obey anyone or anything just because it is a law.\nI bolded the \"if\" for you.\n \n \nPeople should receive what they earn\n\n LOL! Right, like they do now? Who gets to decide what people \"earn\", you? Who decides the value of labour? \n \n \nI think you are a little too \"learned\" for your own good, you sacrifice good old-fashioned common sense for \"enlightenment\".\n\n Puh-leeze. Plenty of educated people are complete XXXXXX when it comes to racism, so don't pull an anti-academic hissy fit. There's good old-fashioned common sense, then there's good old-fashioned stupidity. \n \n \nMAN, it just would kill you to admit that Whites have done anything good in this world, wouldn't it?\n\n Now, now, give credit where credit's due.\n \n Besides, don't be so melodramatic. I have no problem with white people. Some of my best friends are white people. ;)\n \n It's racist people I have a problem with. \n \n \nI think MOST people consider Egyptians to be people of Middle Eastern descent. They certainly do not classify themselves as Black.\n\n That depends on where/when in Egypt they are from, and who was in charge at the time. North Africa is an area where people are very mixed, \"racial\" systems tend to break down in such areas. Certainly many Pharoahs were dark-skinned, with African features, there was an era of Ethiopian (\"Nubian\") dynasty, and so on. That contemporary people of the area are lighter-skinned doesn't take away it's significance as an African culture.\n \n \nMay I reference South Africa? A country with a VERY high standard of living compared to the rest of Africa (I can hear it now, \"by whose standards\"), handed to Blacks on a silver platter, and STILL not able to make it a success.\n\n LOL, sure, a country that was legally segregated under White rule until 10 years ago is a great example of how Black people always screw things up! The \"very high\" standard of living couldn't possibly have to do with averaging out the DeBeers fortune against the wages of the people dying in the mines, could it? Boy, you're a case...\n \n So, what is it that you think makes Black people so inferior? Is it a magical component of melanin we haven't yet discovered that makes people stupid and lazy?

When did the debate center around someone being HIT by a car, that was never the point!!!

Yeah, those McDonald's hamburgers are well worth $15 each. But wait, there WOULDN'T be a McDonald's if burgers were that price, would there? And wait, where would those working there then work without a McDonald's? They wouldn't, would they, they would have their pleading eyes turned toward the government to take care of them.

I wasn't talking about how South Africa became the country it became, I was referencing the FACT that a country was given to the Black-they didn't have to build it up from scratch-and they STILL screwed it up. I'd LOVE to hear your explanation as to how they did that!\n \n \nSo, what is it that you think makes Black people so inferior? Is it a magical component of melanin we haven't yet discovered that makes people stupid and lazy?

I have never discriminated against a Black and treat them with respect in social settings or in business matters. I have my opinions about the direction the Black culture is heading and believe that it is taking us down with them, but I fail to see how that makes me a racist. I AM allowed to have my personal preferences, am I not? If I feel more comfortable with those of my own race, is that a bad thing? We all stereotype (as you have down with me)-I also believe that is a survival instinct. Afterall, aren't wild animals wary of humans, even though not ALL of us want to kill them? Simple analogy I know, but I don't think we are void of all instincts, despite how enlightened we feel we are.\n \n \nYou didn't answer the question.\n\n \n Well, there is a growing list of those I have posed to you and they go totally ignored or you try to turn it around and have me answer my own question.

I can tell you that this is not my culture, and so I'm hardly an expert. I do have friends, though, who are breakdancers, rappers, graffitti artists, etc., so everything I know about it I learned from them.\n \n On the surface, any culture different from one's own seems strange. However, upon investigation, everything comes from somewhere, good or bad.\n If I present to you a sort of explanation of contemporary urban Black culture as I see it, and give you links to websites with more explanations, would you be willing to explore the possibility that Hip Hop culture makes sense, and is not dangerous, but in fact has multiple positive aspects?",

The \"White\" media (I'm assuming this doesn't just mean the press, this means entertainment and such) glorifies the Black culture. Almost every commercial you see has some Black culture associated with it. A few years back I saw Sesame Street with my kids and ABC's were in rap. Sorry, I never heard it in heavy metal. Anyway, White culture is flawed, I never said it was perfect. There has always been White Trash and there always WILL be White Trash. Yes, Whites commit crimes, heinous crimes, but not at the proportionate level as Blacks. I don't have alot of time this morning, but there is one thing my wife has observed (she is from Peru by the way, yes this racist pig has married a \"woman of color\" LOL) about Blacks-they have a lack of pride in themselves. They can say it all they want, but there actions say differently. At first this didn't make sense to me, but I soon realized what she said is true. You can call me cracker and any other negative term for Whites all you want, and it won't bother me for a second because I have pride in myself. You can call my wife any negative Hispanic term you want, and she doesn't care because she has pride in herself. A poor person can still be clean, yet Blacks many times receive assistance in getting nice new homes or apartments, and in short order they are reduced to slums. True pride in oneself would be manifested in lifting oneself up, not bringing oneself down \n \n \nIt's not just a \"simple analogy\", it's a false analogy. Humans are all the same species. Of course, stereotyping is necessary to a degree, it is part of how we learn. However, I think the information you have about Black people and Black cultures is false, or incomplete, or skewed.

AND if I'm mugged by a White kid with tattoos all over I'm gonna be wary of White kids with tattoos all over. I also have to say that just as you feel I have incomplete, false or skewed information, I could say the same thing about you in the sense that you could easily dismiss facts about Black culture because you feel it's racist. I'm in a position to see the credit history of many people, and it cannot be argued that Blacks (on the whole) have a huge problem with credit, yet they will complain that when they go for a loan and don't get it, it MUST be racist. Oh, and it may shock you to know this, but my parents are from the northeast, hate the south because of the segregation and treatment of Blacks, and have never used the dreaded \"N\" word. So, I have never been taught all that I speak of, merely just observations of the real world.\n \n And I will have the courtesy to read whatever you would like to send. I do want to say though, that I am not so gullible to believe that ALL Blacks are bad, just as I don't believe ALL of today's youth is bad. The press goes for the sensational as we all know. I come into contact with Blacks who are good, decent, hardworking people who I would have eat at my table anytime. I know it's a bad thing in this PC world we live in, but all of what I say are generalizations and not directed at every individual.

AND if I'm mugged by a White kid with tattoos all over I'm gonna be wary of White kids with tattoos all over.\n\n The question is, why aren't you having other interactions with Black ppl, or White ppl with tattoos? If you had previous experiences of Black ppl or White ppl with tattoos, you wouldn't attribute your being mugged to those characteristics. Maybe if you also had some economic analysis, you would understand how it came to be that you had a full wallet and the other person had an empty stomach.\n \n \n I'm in a position to see the credit history of many people, and it cannot be argued that Blacks (on the whole) have a huge problem with credit, yet they will complain that when they go for a loan and don't get it, it MUST be racist.\n\n This makes no sense.

Not to mention that I don't think you need to be told that many Black ppl live in very clean poor and wealthy neighborhoods, so it's obviously not endemic. \n \n \n Once again, I never said that ALL Blacks are guilty of this. But there are endless examples that we have all seen in our everyday lives-new apartment complexes built for low income folks that are destroyed in short order; new homes fall victim as well. And sorry, they have everything to do with pride. It doesn't take much to clean a yard or sweep a floor, but I'll bet you that they have a nice car and nice clothes to go out in. Naturally, you will respond with me as somehow putting these people down for not having nice furnishings-got nothing to do with it!! When someone wants to present a good appearance, isn't that SOME indication of pride? \n \n \nMaybe if you also had some economic analysis, you would understand how it came to be that you had a full wallet and the other person had an empty stomach.\n\n \n Man, you people just won't stop, will you? Why do I need to understand THEM? Oh, I forgot, I'm supposed to understand the terrorists too! MY mistake! Maybe THEY should try understanding that work will get you rewards, maybe not as much as selling drugs, but at least they could look in the mirror and have some pride in themselves for doing an honest days work. And I'm so sick and tired of this economic XXXX-these thugs on the street make 10 times more than I do, and they are committing criomes and I'M not! What about the Depression? When the economy really WAS worse than it is today?\n \n \nThis makes no sense. Despite the fact that Black ppl have no worse credit than ppl of other \"races\", they get denied loans, and you are arguing that this is not racist?\n\n \n Makes TONS of sense! These evil corporations you loathe want to make money, do they not? And since they are evil, they want to make money at any cost, right? Then why in God's name would they deny someone an opportunity to make them money? UH, because they realize that Blacks in general are a much greater risk and they therefore would LOSE money. \n \n \nThe question is, why aren't you having other interactions with Black ppl, or White ppl with tattoos?\n\n \n If I choose not to, why is that bad? Why is that any of your concern?\n \n \nNope. I just don't think you know what \"many\" Black ppl are doing, and you don't seem open to trying to understand why\n\n \n Well, when they are ready to stop assuming that all Whites are evil, maybe we can talk",

   "Well, I ob viously was referring to lawyers, and yes people put a higher premium on their freedom than they do a clean toilet, so your analogy is absurd.

So obviously, while \"economies\" are man made, there are certain things that do follow a course of nature so to speak.

A state is not a homogenous entity.\n\n \n This is in reference to the WORLD being better off, country to country, rather than individual citizens of any country. When the Soviet Union was still in control of their empire, the world in general was a safer place. Now, since they have crumbled (still hurts doesn't it? LOL), the world has to deal with a bunch of little countries that suddenly have nuclear weapons and little control over the citizens and/or radical groups that could easily topple the governments. So yes, South Africa falls under that category of countries. When the Whites had power and control, the world had little to fear from South Africa. Now it's in chaos and who knows what we will have to deal with in the future.\n \n \nRacism is power plus racial prejudice, a system that leads to the oppression of or discrimination against, specific racial or ethnic groups. \n \n \n Interesting, I wonder who made up this definition. Seems to me, under this definition, I am not a racist. I have no power over Blacks, I am not a system. I find it convenient that you come up with a definition that excludes Blacks from EVER being racist against Whites. Tell me, what DO you call their hate toward Whites?\n \n Furthermore, name me one aspect of the government (system) that is set up to keep the Blacks down. The only thing I come up with is welfare and other social programs. And if this is the case, we have the Liberals to thank for it.\n \n \nAgain, this is not relevant.

In fact, few people are in interracial relationships where they don't have issues of racism to deal with. \n \n \n It's very relevant.

Are you going to sit there and tell me that the love I have for my wife is somehow false because I have these racist feelings and feel the need to dominate and control a minority? If so, then I sure hope you will then say that Black guys going out with White women is strictly to get back at the White man for all the evils perpetrated against them, that the women are just \"ho's\" and that there is no love whatsoever. To REASONABLE people, it's one or the other. The arrogance you have to even suggest this.

If that weren't true, why don't we just print up enough money to make us all bilionaires?\n\n You are confounding a \"course of nature\" with a system. A market system has rules and conventions. It would destroy the system to print up billions of dollars, not because this is somehow \"against nature\", but because the market system depends on scarcity. The reason why \"corrections\" such as government regulations tend \"not to work\" is that they are ways to counteract the effects of the system. For example, the Depression (an inevitable event) was adapted to by the means of social programming- therefore even if the economy were or is as \"bad\" as it was during the Depression, social programs \n now supposedly exist to \"cushion\" the effects on the poor and working classes. \n \n This is the standard \"liberal\" answer you continue to incorrectly attribute to me. I am not by any means a liberal. I don't actually fit on that political spectrum at all, I'm not a conservative or a Marxist either.\n \n \nAre you saying that we should just stop everything and mandate that cleaning toilets require a higher income than an attorney?\n\n Any good and functional system has a review procedure. I think the current system of attributing value to certain employments is fundamentally disfunctional. I also thing it would be a good idea to \"stop everything\". Sometimes you need to pull over and check the map, or ask for directions. It is clear that this sytem does not function. Why beat a dead horse?\n \n \n This is in reference to the WORLD being better off, country to country, rather than individual citizens of any country. When the Soviet Union was still in control of their empire, the world in general was a safer place.\n\n A country is never \"safe\" or in peril. A country is just an agreed-upon bordered area. If you aren't talking about the average citizen, you must be talking about someone else. Clearly, you mean you, and people like you. The people you would hang out with if you moved to that country- the wealthy, the minority.\n \n The people that matter in deciding whether South Africa should be governed in this way or that are South Africans. South Africans are on the whole much happier that Aparthied is over in the legal sense, but are upset about the continued effects of the system that seem to not be going away. \n \n \n I have no power over Blacks, I am not a system.\n\n No one person is ever a system. You behave within a system, and within the system of racism, if you are white you have the most power within that system.\n \n \nTell me, what DO you call their hate toward Whites?\n\n Ummm.... \"hate towards whites\", how about that? Within a system of racism, hate towards whites by people of color is not the same thing as hate towards people of color by whites. It would be ridiculous to call a Jewish person's hatred of a Nazi anti-Semitic, and the same logic goes here. \n \n \nFurthermore, name me one aspect of the government (system) that is set up to keep the Blacks down. \n\n Hate to break it to you, but if you study some history, you will find that the entire system never could have existed without the oppression of Native and Black people to begin with. The US gov't is a settler society, by it's very nature parasitic. It's triangular economics. The slave system provided the labor, the Natives land provided the raw goods, all profits were shipped to the Motherland until the settlers got too greedy to bear that and rebelled to keep the profits for themselves. American history in a nutshell. \n \n It's simple economics- within a market system, cheap labor and cheap materials are required in order to make super-profits. Black ppl were the cheap labor, Native land provided cheap materials, and settlers cashed in. Of course, there was a \"poorer\" settler class, for administrative and skilled labor, just as there were and remain class differences between black ppl, etc. \n \n The only major change in this system is that US prison/migrant labor combined with international maquiladoras has replaced slavery (with little marked change in conditions), and the size of the skilled/administrative class has increased.\n \n \nAre you going to sit there and tell me that the love I have for my wife is somehow false because I have these racist feelings and feel the need to dominate and control a minority?\n\n I don't know you, or your wife. However, you can't have it both ways. Either you believe white people are superior, and that when they don't run things everything goes to sh!t, or you believe you and your wife are equals. That's a personal choice you have to make.\n \n \nWhat is your evidence that it IS?

However, growth has not been strong enough to cut into high unemployment, and daunting economic problems remain from the apartheid era, especially the problems of poverty and lack of economic empowerment among the disadvantaged groups. Other problems are crime, corruption, and HIV/AIDS. At the start of 2000, President MBEKI vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment, and to reduce poverty by relaxing restrictive labor laws, stepping up the pace of privatization, and cutting unneeded governmental spending. The economy slowed in 2001, largely the result of the slowing of the \"international economy.\n \n (my emphasize)",

But it was aided by the South-african political system that is quite different from the US one.

By having this system, there have been very little revenge exacted on the white minority. And the white minority has still retained a relative large political influence.

   "Our race hysterical culture makes it very difficult to speak frankly these days, but the incessant accusation by many blacks and white liberals about how evil whites are can only be borne for so long. As whites passed the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights, they decided they hadn't gone far enough to be nice, so they even imposed upon themsleves legislation that would discriminate against their own children in college admissions and job positions so folks who had been treated unfairly could have more opportunities. In spite of this willingness to move one's children aside for others, their efforts were not appreciated; in fact, the accusations of wickedness have only gotten louder and more shrill than ever. \n \n Well even nice people can only be pushed so far; at some point we begin to say enough niceness; now it's time to tell the real truth about why American blacks are not as wealthy as American whites. The average white is not doing well because some black guy picked cotton for no wages 200 years ago. The uncomfortable truth is that we live in a modern, complex society where income has become very dependent on cognitive abilities, and absolute bullet-proof research shows that American blacks, on average, score 15 points lower on cognitive tests than average American whites. Of course, when someone mentions this uncomfortable fact, either we try to distract attention from the facts by demonizing the messenger, or the vain attempt is made to refute the research. \n \n I won't bore you with all the proof; you folks are smart enough to look into the research (if you want to read a book that will make a man (or woman) out of you, read the g Factor by Arthur Jensen). But just to give you a taste of the proof, a common criticism of IQ tests is that they measure white culture, something black naturally wouldn't test as well at. Well if that is true, why does the average black score an 85 on a non-verbal IQ test that is based on pictures, while the average citizen of China who makes less than $1000 a year score 100 on the test? The average Chinese person has absorbed more white culture than the average American black? \n \n It is no fun to bring up uncomfortable facts that are uncomplimentary of others, but when whites are constantly demonized for black poverty, at some point they are forced to tell truth and can no longer let unattractive facts just remain secret in the research lab.",

You end up having to concoct the thinnest, most serpentine, and contrived and stretched, and contorted arguments to try to defend your side of it. Let me get this right, I owe every Black American because my great, great, great grandfather saved a nickel on his cotton shirts because Southern cotton growers did not pay full market value costs for their field laborers. \n \n This hardly requires rebuttal, but a couple additional points. Since slaves were expensive \"property\", the most valuable \"assets\" owned by the slaveholder, he tended to provide them better material conditions than the poor white laborers who he didn't give a damn about the welfare of. So in the end slavery did not lower prices much. In fact, reliable slave workers created a disincentive to improve technologies (like the cotton gin for example) which would have lowered prices much more than marginally cheaper slave labor. \n \n From your strained argument, we can just as validly argue the following: The National Crime Victimization Survey data (which have been collected since 1972) show us that roughly 60% of robberies are commited by blacks every year even though they are only 13% of the U.S. population. The NCVS data also show us that most of the victioms are white. And most of the whites victimized since 1972 are even still alive. This same pattern holds for all types of serious street crime, including murder. We could also use the NCVS to calculate estimates prior to 1972, before the survey was started. So we need to form a commission to calculate the costs in terms of valuables, injury, and lost productivity inflicted on whites, and require black Americans to pay them reparations. \n \n \n\n ... and the people who were already living here or were brought here as slaves got disease, torture, death, and also got to do all the work while the lazy hung out munching on their \"fruits of freedom\".

I'll bet the \"poor white laborer\" looked on with jealousy while the slaves were beaten and raped.\n \n\n The issue was not how the white laborers felt about their situation; the issue is how much slavery lowered the costs of things and benefitted the ancestors of people like me. Your foaming-at-the-mouth hatred for the United States is preventing you from keeping your focus. \n \n \n\n If that commission were to reduce that amount from the figure owed for slavery reparations, I doubt it would make a dent.\n \n\n I have just established that the vast majority of white Amrericans living today are not wealthier because of unjust economic practices of 150 years ago.

Obviously you have never ran anything. You see, when you run business, you have other people do the manual labor while you manage the enterprise. Just ask anybody who's ever run a business if only the manual laborers do work. It is a childish, fanciful delusion of liberals who've never run things to think that managers don't work. The choice was not between slaveowners or slaves working the fields, the choice was whether slaves or poor white laborers would do it. \n \n \n\n So, in your opinion, after being kidnapped and enslaved for hundreds of years, when the enslavers one day turn around and decide it's no longer profitable, the enslaved are supposed to be grateful? \n \n Maybe if the colonists hadn't brought slavery to this land, and profited off of it for generations, people might be inclined to think well of them for getting rid of it.

The first people to question it morally, and the first people to crusade against it, and ultimately to shed rivers of blood to stop it were whites. \n \n Nobody is asking people to not see slavery for the grave injustice it was. What shrill, angry demands for reparations reveal is a lack of perspective, a lack of context, a lack of a sense of what is fair to white Americans. And as people like Juan Williams (an African American) have argued, demanding reparations will only hurt race relations. The overwhelming majority of whites are against it, and every time Al Sharpton agitates for it, another white guy joins a white supremacist group.

   "That is the most absurd discription of capitalism I have ever heard in my life.\n\n lol... I wasn't attempting to describe capitalism- I don't have volumes of bandwidth. You asked for an example of the slavery system that persists, I gave you one. You seem to have misunderstood it, I'll get into the details below. Maybe I wasn't clear. As I said, I was speaking in shorthand. I could have used the prison system instead, or any other example.\n \n \nFirst of all, the US is responsible for more agricultural output than any other nation on the planet. \n\n \nNow, the agricultural economy in the US is virtually nonexistant,\n\n You're right. I meant agricultural labour as a part of the US job economy. People do not own plantations or \"family farms\" anymore in the US. Multinationals who own vast acres use either machines or migrant workers. Compared to fifty years ago, there is no future in being a farmer or farm labourer in the US.\n \n Again, the migrant labourers are another example. They are not slaves, but their status keeps labour costs artificially low, allowing for the same superprofits as the slavery system. Imagine for a second if businesses had to pay fruit pickers a living wage. \n \n \nWe feed more people than any other nation.\n\n Being an agricultural exporter doesn't mean you feed people.\n \n \nSecondly, it is true that some labor jobs have left the country for more profitable destinations. However, American manufacturing is still quit strong. Strong enough in fact to have added 37,000 new jobs last month alone.\n\n Prison labour? Workfare? Maybe temporary positions? These are the kinds of \"jobs\" being created right now- ones with no benefits, low wages, and no future.\n \n \nThird, there exist no \"dictators\" or \"militaries\" in the \"super-profit\" business world. We live amongst a free capital society.\n\n Um... Banana Republic? Who trains the soldiers that keep the price of Columbian fruit low? Who shoots the coffee picking Guatemalans when they try to unionize? Who guards the mines America gets their raw materials from?\n \n Don't forget, Panama's Noriega and even Saddam were on payroll as long as they did their jobs. \n \n \nThey do need to worry about competion, market share, and overhead expenditures. \n\n I'm presuming you meant to write competition. What the small business owner really has to worry about is monopolization.\n \n \nThe minorities that choose \"illegal economies\" do so by their own free will not by the hands of the American Government.\n\n Those that choose illegal economies do so because it makes the most sense for them. If you're a single mother choosing between hooking for four hours a night vs working 60 hr weeks for half the pay plus daycare, sure, that's a \"free will choice\". You shouldn't judge other people's choices when you don't understand the conditions of their lives.\n \n \nIn fact the minorities that succeed in said activities could also succeed in the free market society as well as the \" super- profits\" if they chose a ligitament profession.\n\n You mean \"legitimate\"? Sorry, not true. Statistically speaking, what you are saying is just not factual.\n \n \nYour feelings of victimization are unfounded.\n\n Actually, I'm not a Black person.\n \n \nThey are also,unfortunatly, the reason for the huge tax burden on hard working Americans. Your mentality, and others like yours, has led to the current government which has become a provider when it was designed to function at a minimum.\n\n Also, unfortunately, untrue. The American government is not a provider, and what it was \"designed\" to do is debateable.\n \n \nThe issue was not how the white laborers felt about their situation; the issue is how much slavery lowered the costs of things and benefitted the ancestors of people like me.\n\n Sure. Except that the \"poor white labourer\" in the settler colonies made up at most 5 % of the population. Even he most often ended up an overseer, than a landowner. \n \n You have been misinformed. The British and other Europeans who colonized America did so for the land. They were promised and given land. The fact that the land was other people's didn't bother them, but I guess that's an aside. The point is that there were virtually no white peoplein America during that era that did not or would not own land. Almost every settler was given land, and the only people who had no land and were poor labourers were Black people and Native people, mostly slaves.\n \n Further, it isn't simply a matter of individuals owning slaves, but of an entire slave-based economy. The trade of slaves, the selling of excess or low-grade food for slaves, the building of slave ships, these were the basis of the American economy of the day. Every settler involved in that economy profited from the slave trade, in every business interaction they had.\n \n \nI have just established that the vast majority of white Amrericans living today are not wealthier because of unjust economic practices of 150 years ago.\n\n Where?\n \n \nI guess that trumps people like de Tocqueville who actually observed and admired the working habits of elite Americans.\n\n De Tocqueville was impressed by the lack of class distinctions in white settler society. He was appalled by slavery. He did not understand that one led to the other.\n \n \nJust ask anybody who's ever run a business if only the manual laborers do work. \n\n I don't think I should bother. The only person who can \"manage\" labour is one who has experience with that labour themself. There's no use in a farm manager that does not understand hauling potatoes, or a band manager who knows nothing about music. Besides, that's not the point.\n \n The point is that there was a class of managers, and a class of labourers, and this was divided according to race. This means that the managers were always at an economic advantage. Besides the fact that they were not enslaved. It is fundamentally the actions of a lazy group of people to ensure that they never have to do any labour by enslaving others. I can't think of anything lazier, actually.\n \n \nThe choice was not between slaveowners or slaves working the fields, the choice was whether slaves or poor white laborers would do it.\n\n As I said, there were hardly any poor white labourers. For the few that were, their status was temporary, so they didn't have to toil for long.\n \n \nSlavery has been a ubiquitous system throughout human history.\n\n Slavery is not a system. It is a characteristic of a system. When most people speak of the \"slavery system\", they're referring to the economic system which is specific to a particular era of human history. \n \n The American slavery system is simply not comparable to most other slavery systems. They are only similar in that they involve a person being taken and forced to work for a particular period. American slavery was much more complex than that.\n \n It's like saying that a Neolithic village that traded freely has a market economy, and comparing it to the American economy. They're different animals.\n \n \nThe first people to question it morally, and the first people to crusade against it, and ultimately to shed rivers of blood to stop it were whites.\n\n Also untrue. Slave revolts and rebellions were constant, and ultimately led to the end of the slavery system. Northern whites did not want to end slavery, they did not want free Black people in their towns and they in fact actively mobbed and lynched Black people regularly. Black people fought in the revolutionary and Civil Wars to gain freedom, and bled and died for it. Again, Northern whites didn't want to end slavery, in fact neither did Lincoln, despite the fairy tales told of him.\n \n \nThe overwhelming majority of whites are against it, and every time Al Sharpton agitates for it, another white guy joins a white supremacist group.\n\n Racist white people will always join white supremecist groups when they feel their upper hand is threatened. Al Sharpton couldn't stop that with all the sucking up and selling out in the world.",

   "Wow... this thread is interesting.\n \n I must say that I`m not so familiar with the history of the US, there`s a couple of points that I`d like to make.\n \n About the effects of past exploitation.\n I we see past exploitation as illegitimate excess extraction of resources from individuals, we can conclude that past exloitation give rise to past economic gains. In a capitalistic society a portion of economic gain is \"always\" ploughed down into some forms of capital investements. Past capital investments generates present economic gain. Therefor, past exploitation of slave labour generate present economic gain. But this does not tell us who gains (which is probably the more interesting question). But its safe to say that its not exclusively ancestors to slave owners...\n \n About US putting an end to slavery\n I think you will find that the US was not the first country to abolish slavery within its borders. And if I recall correctly, Brittain was the first country to try to actually combat slavery outside its own borders. Nor has slavery as world phenomenon ended.\n \n About slavery and other forms of employment\n It is true that slaves where often considered as valuable goods that where not supposed to be harmed. At least in Europe. In many ways, wage labour was far more exploitive and harsh than slave labour. Especially when you factor in laws that made it illegal to be unemployed (assuming you where poor) and forced labour was relative common throughout europe at the turn of the 19th century. But this does not make slavery any less decpicable and horrendous. It is the ultimate commodification of goods to make human beings subject to ownership... Slavery was not so much an economic injustice as it was a political. Hmmm.. don`t really know where I`m going with this, so I`ll stop now.",

After all, if you aren't inheriting any money from your slave-profiting family, than you're really being self-sufficient. Let's just put all our child-rearing money in a big pot, and everyone gets the same amount for their kid expenses, education, etc... \n \n Besides, if you don't agree with people getting money to do with things that happened hundreds of years ago, shouldn't that apply to you too?\n\n \n \n Whats scary is that I know two other people that think this way.\n \n Don't you know anyone that has built there own wealth. Not all money is inherited. I have no family from which to inherit. Every thing that I now own I have earned myself. I work every day to get a little more.\n \n The senario you described above is indicative of lazy, I want stuff for nothing, attitudes that IMO are growing more and more common.

   "Further, it isn't simply a matter of individuals owning slaves, but of an entire slave-based economy. The trade of slaves, the selling of excess or low-grade food for slaves, the building of slave ships, these were the basis of the American economy of the day. Every settler involved in that economy profited from the slave trade, in every business interaction they had.\n \n\n These claims cannot even be taken seriously. The black population has always been a small minority of the American population, but somehow the livelihoods of the vast majority of Americans hung on the labor of that small group. You'd think that for the past 400 years, whites Americans have been lying around and sippin' lemonade while the slaves built the vast country we see today, even the parts of the country where they never lived in any number. It is a damn shame that those people were brought to America. If they would have been left in Africa, their labors were so incredible, they would have built that continent into the wealthiest economy in the world, while we white folks would be living in Third World America. \n \n The truth is that if America had never practiced slavery at all, it would have turned out basically the same, except not having the deep racial problems we have. Blacks have never had more than a marginal role in American expansion and activity. The course of American development would have changed very little had it never practiced slavery. To argue for reparations, you have to concoct farfetched claims that the work of slaves was so vital, that 200 million whites 150 years later would be poor without it. \n \n On the issue of white laborers, many whites were sharecroppers and even indentured servants working off the debts they accrued coming to America. And of course many were involved in non-farm activities. And of course many did eventually become small landowners because of abundant land, but how did they profit from slavery? They would have been competing with slave plantations using labor that you emphasize was so cheap which would have made it hard for them to compete. Wouldn't they have been wealthier if they were competing with the slaveowners on the same playing field? \n \n The fact is that slavery enriched the slaveowners. They lost much of their wealth during Reconstruction, but any honest reparations movement would target their descendants. There is abundant genealogical data in the country to find out who descends from the slaveowners, and an investigation could be done to actually find out if there are descendants living today who materially benefitted from the ancestors. But the reparations movement has not followed the honest and fair path because there isn't enough money doing that way. If you're going to give a decent check to every black man, woman, and child in the U.S. (more than 30 million people) you're going to have to soak all white people. \n \n And speaking of that, how is this money going to be collected? I presume that it would be in the form of a tax collected by the federal government, then a check to goes out to every black person in the country. But how do you collect the tax? When you do your tax returns, will a white person be instructed to pay at the higher tax bracket because of a white penality? \n \n \n\n I don't think I should bother. The only person who can \"manage\" labour is one who has experience with that labour themself. There's no use in a farm manager that does not understand hauling potatoes, or a band manager who knows nothing about music. Besides, that's not the point.\n \n\n You're right, that's not the point. The point was that managers work hard, not whether they've had the experience of being subordinate.\n \n \n\n ...so they didn't have to toil for long.\n \n\n Yeah, whew once those whites guys finally got a piece of land, their working days were over. Unlike slaves who found ways to decrease their productivity since the farm wasn't theirs and in order to subvert what was going on, the white farmers knew that if they didn't work from dawn until dusk, they and their children would go hungry. \n \n \n\n The American slavery system is simply not comparable to most other slavery systems. They are only similar in that they involve a person being taken and forced to work for a particular period. American slavery was much more complex than that.\n \n It's like saying that a Neolithic village that traded freely has a market economy, and comparing it to the American economy. They're different animals.\n \n\n Yeah, the important difference here is that you're all upset when America practices it. The slavery issue is incidental to the opportunity prove the unique wickedness of America. \n \n \n\n Also untrue. Slave revolts and rebellions were constant, and ultimately led to the end of the slavery system. Northern whites did not want to end slavery, they did not want free Black people in their towns and they in fact actively mobbed and lynched Black people regularly. Black people fought in the revolutionary and Civil Wars to gain freedom, and bled and died for it. Again, Northern whites didn't want to end slavery, in fact neither did Lincoln, despite the fairy tales told of him.\n \n\n Are you consitutionally unable to give America credit for anything? Your silliness amazes me. I have NEVER ever read any serious historian who thinks the cause of the Civil War and black emancipation was black revolt. I think you are confusing the U.S. with Haiti. I've always been amazed at the complacency of blacks under slavery. Some whites tried to enslave some American Indians, but were never succsessful because Indians would rather die than be a slave. I'm afraid you are so obsessed with demonstrating that whites are incapable of doing anything good that you are the one deluded with all the fairy tales. \n \n \n\n Racist white people will always join white supremecist groups when they feel their upper hand is threatened. Al Sharpton couldn't stop that with all the sucking up and selling out in the world.\n\n \n Not only are liberals congenitally unable to do anything but indict whites, they also seems to be congenitally unable to be see that reality cannot be whatever you wish it to be, and given the realities, to be practical. \n \n I read the other day that around 1000 AD North African Muslims enslaved as many as 1 million Christians. If Christians were to start a movement today to demand that Muslims pay Christians reparations, do you think this agitation would have no effect on the Muslims? After years and years of being called wicked haters who need to empty out their savings accounts to Christians, do you think they would be unaffected by this incessant agitation? Would their attitudes toward Christians be totally unconnected to Christians calling them evil haters day after day? If the Muslims finally got sick of it, organized, and killed some Christians, would your arguments that Muslim haters are going to hate no matter make the victims any less dead?",

   "These claims cannot even be taken seriously. The black population has always been a small minority of the American population, but somehow the livelihoods of the vast majority of Americans hung on the labor of that small group.\n\n Where do you get your information? By the time of the \"War of Independance\" there was one African slave for every four white settlers. You call that a \"small minority\" of the population? Conversely, at the time, First Peoples vastly outnumbered the white settlers. My source is Richard Hofstadter's America at 1750, but I doubt you'll find much disagreement on this.\n \n \nThey would have been competing with slave plantations using labor that you emphasize was so cheap which would have made it hard for them to compete. Wouldn't they have been wealthier if they were competing with the slaveowners on the same playing field? \nYou'd think that for the past 400 years, whites Americans have been lying around and sippin' lemonade while the slaves built the vast country we see today, even the parts of the country where they never lived in any number. \n\n Where they were not there were First Peoples, Mexicans, Chinese and other people. You shouldn't take this so personally, I'm not attacking you. I'm only quoting what people have been saying in source documents of the time. For example, when Virginia's Gov. Fauquier couldn't get white people to sign up for the militia in 1759 he bemoaned, \"Every man in this colony has land, and none but Negroes are laborers,\" (Hofstadter, op.cit.) The fact that white settlers in America were so wealthy that to get a white laborer cost several times as much as it did in Europe was well-established. Thomas Paine boasted that in America a \"common laborer\" made as much as a shopkeeper back in England (quoted in Philip S. Foner's Labor and the American Revolution). The amount ranged in difference between at least twice in England to five or six times the wages in other areas of Europe (this from Richard Morris' study as well as B. Katherine and Robert E. Brown's).\n \n I'm not saying that being an artisan, gentleman farmer or an overseer wasn't hard work, but it certainly doesn't in any way compare with slavery. White settlers didn't have to \"compete\" with slaves, they were in an entirely different niche.\n \n \nIt is a damn shame that those people were brought to America. If they would have been left in Africa, their labors were so incredible, they would have built that continent into the wealthiest economy in the world, while we white folks would be living in Third World America.\n\n Again, this is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of colonial economics. Slaves labored incredibly because their lives depended on it. This was not a case of working for survival, which is difficult but not comparable to working for another's profit. Also, African economies of the time were not based on wealth creation but survival and stability. Further, \"Third World\" economies do not exist because of lack of labor, but colonist exploitation. So it is improbable that Africa's wealth or stability would have rendered America poor.\n \n That said, America would clearly not have existed without slavery. White colonies were not self-sufficient, note the failure of any such colonies that were attempted. Long before the Cotton South, the Dutch used Africans farmers, carpenters and blacksmiths to build Manhattan. Indian slavery and slave-selling was widespread, and was the bulk of exports for some colonies, such as it was in the Carolinas. \n \n \n And of course many did eventually become small landowners because of abundant land, \n\n Well, let's be honest. They had to kill off any First Peoples living there first, before they could take the \"abundant\" land.\n \n \nThe fact is that slavery enriched the slaveowners. They lost much of their wealth during Reconstruction,\n\n Where did that money go? Did the Reconstruction cause them to lose large amounts of change into their sofas? Money doesn't just \"dissapear\", it moves around, and anyone who got that money profited from slavery.\n \n \nYeah, the important difference here is that you're all upset when America practices it. The slavery issue is incidental to the opportunity prove the unique wickedness of America. \n\n America was not the only nation to profit from the slavery system. I never argued it was. Don't get distracted by conspiracy theories.\n \n \nAre you consitutionally unable to give America credit for anything? Your silliness amazes me. I have NEVER ever read any serious historian who thinks the cause of the Civil War and black emancipation was black revolt. \n\n Well, just because you don't know something does not mean it's untrue. And don't worry, my silliness is amazing to many people, that also doesn't mean what I'm saying is untrue. In fact, I could be a complete lunatic (you undoubtadly already think so), that would not make my points any less valid. That's the fallacy of ad hominem.\n \n Anyway, I never suggested the Civil War was caused by slave revolts. I said Black people joined to fight because they were assured that it would lead to their freedom. Northern settlers repeated over and over that they did not believe in equality for slaves, but that slavery was causing such an influx of free (escaped) blacks in the North that it had to be stopped.\n \n Gov. Morton of Ohio said \"If we do not exclude slavery from the Territories, it will exclude us.\" There was a movement in the North to confine Black people to the Southern slave states- Illinois, Indiana, Iowa and Oregon legally barred them from entering the state. The North wanted to abolish slavery, technically yes, but only because they believed this would cause Black people in America to \"die out\". They were also actively attacking Northern Black populations in regular mob riots and lynchings. They didn't really want to end slavery in theory, they wanted to get rid of Black people. Not to say that there weren't a few white Abolitionists who were sincere, but let's not be naive. Masses of white people did not fight and die for the sake of freedom for their Black \"brothers\". On the contrary.\n \n Abolitionist Gamalial Bailey promised that Black people would leave the US if slavery was ended. Rev. Horace Bushnell (the North's most prominent theologian) felt Blacks were \"doomed to extinction\" out of Divine Will, \"radical\" abolitionist Rev. Theodore Parker stated \"The strong replaces the weak. Thus, the white man kills the red and black man. When slavery is abolished the African population will decline out of the United States, and die out of the South as out of Northampton and Lexington.\" (Rossiter, The First American Revolution). Lincoln himself said the same over and over. \n \n \nI think you are confusing the U.S. with Haiti. I've always been amazed at the complacency of blacks under slavery. Some whites tried to enslave some American Indians, but were never succsessful because Indians would rather die than be a slave. I'm afraid you are so obsessed with demonstrating that whites are incapable of doing anything good that you are the one deluded with all the fairy tales.\n \n Than why did Jefferson see it as imminantly possible that slaves would revolt entirely, and reverse roles with their former masters- as he put it, \"a revolution of the wheel of fortune, an exchange of situations is among the possible events\"? He argued that slave revolts were too constant to make the slavery system stable, and that all Black children should be removed from their parents and sold to the West Indies and Afrika- thus generating the costs for itself as a venture, and on ther hopes that the elder generation would \"die off in the ordianary course of nature\". He called this Hitlerian nightmare a \"blessed\" arrangement. Not that this stopped him from accumulating slaves himself, he died with more slaves than he started with. (see Ronald Takaki Iron Cages).\n \n Although initially First Peoples were most difficult to enslave because they were on their own land, as I said, that problem was solved first by exchanging them, then by forcibly exporting them for sale in the Spanish colonies.\n \n Aside from the large rebellions such as the Virginia insurrection, the Gabriel uprising, etc., Black people freed themselves in droves during the Revolutionary War- approx 10 000 in Georgia, and over 50 000 in S. Carolina and Virginia. The Black population at this time was rising much faster than the settler population, such that free Blacks made up 25 % of the populations of Washington, Louisville, Baltimore and St Louis, and at least 50 % of the populations of New Orleans, Richmond, Mobile, and Savannah. Keeping in mind that 65-75% of settlers in towns like Louisville, Charleston and Richmond owned Black slaves, you're talking about a potentially explosive situation and everyone knew it. \n \n In 1837 the Baltimore police arrested about 300 \"runaway slaves\"- almost 10 percent of the city's slave population. In 1850 New Orleans police arrested 7 percent of the city's slave population during a 16 month period. These were not \"complacent\" people.\n \n \nI read the other day that around 1000 AD North African Muslims enslaved as many as 1 million Christians.(...)Would their attitudes toward Christians be totally unconnected to Christians calling them evil haters day after day? If the Muslims finally got sick of it, organized, and killed some Christians, would your arguments that Muslim haters are going to hate no matter make the victims any less dead?\n\n 1 million? That seems improbable as few cities even in the East had populations of anywhere near 1 million... Anyway, I don't know enough about this period to judge whether reparations are in order- but what is all this about \"evil haters\" and \"Muslim haters\"? What does this have to do with the system of international slavery? If you were arguing that Spain or England whould pay reparations, that would make sense. \n \n As I said before, I'm not a stickler for reparations so much as I am for making society no longer systematically racist. I'm sure if people thought this was possible the demand for reparations would cease.",

   "When I get time, I will bone up on my history and do some searching to rebut this America-hating tripe. Let me make a few comments now. \n \n Let's be clear about what is going on here. Why all the interest in the alleged sins of whites throughout American history? A huge section of academia devotes its energy to explain and justify the very sad condition of the black community in current day America. The black community is so rife with social problems, all these analyst folks have made it their life's purpose to prove that this condition does not reflect negatively on blacks. The level of black social problems is so extreme, any explanation of it must be extreme as well so as to adequately explain it. As a consequence, it is incumbent on the analyst to create a story of white racism that is so deep, so pervasive, so systematic, so institutionalized, so historical, so deep in the bones of the American system that it leaves the reader saying, \"Oh NOW I see why black society is SO degraded. It is because the White Man is THAT evil.\" \n \n I take no pleasure in rebutting these claims because I don't have the kind of personality that takes pleasure in pointing fingers. I wish we could just say that we're all good people, let's forget about racial issues and move on. But someone has to answer these charges, even it the affair is unpleasant.\n \n That leads me to follow the wisdom of Occam's razor that the true explanation of something is probably the simplest one. There is no need to send off an army of a thousand historians and a thousand sociologists to concoct stories of white wickedness to demonstrate why black incomes do not equal white incomes. The answer can come from one simple idea that is subject to a much more scientific approach than say history which is more humanities than science.\n \n I have read quite a few books, but I have never read a book that was more rigorous, more scientific, that challenged my ability to follow it because the science was so sophisticated than the g Factor. It will make a man or woman out of you if you read it, but I'm sure the Mizmaxxes of the world will say it is written by Arthur Jensen so we can be certain it is worthless. (In fact, the Mizmaxxes of the world would probably like to see you locked up for reading it--they do it in Europe and Canada already for writing it). And I won't blaspheme by using the words Bell or Curve or Charles or Murray or Richard or Herrnstein, so to give you another option that won't give you a splitting headache to get through all the technical jargon or that won't get you locked up in jail for hate activities, try any of U. of Delaware professor Linda Gottfredson's relevant articles at http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/index.html.\n \n She and dozens of other psychometricians provide endless evidence that blacks tend to have lower levels of the \"g Factor\" (general intelligence) than whites, and that these differences explain differences in income. If we want a society where blacks make as much as whites, the effective approach is not to concoct a slanderous history of white oppression in order to guilt them into turning over their money to blacks, but to eliminate the skills gap between the races. \n \n I'm sure that, in contrast to Ms. Mizmaxx and myself, most of you don't want to waste your entire lives fretting over race relations, pouring over boring and difficult books, so here's a couple comments. \n \n Some of you may ask, \"Well aren't those tests biased? You know they were designed by a bunch of white guys, so why would we expect blacks to do so well on them?\" (I just thought of a similar question: The American economic system was designed by whites in accordance with their cultures, abilities, preferences and traits. Why would we expect blacks to be able to thrive in that system as much as whites, even if opportunities were equal?). \n \n Anyway, back to the question. The fact is that non-verbal IQ tests have been designed and given to people all around the world. And which countries score the highest on the test? Must be the white countries right? Nope, EVERY one of the highest countries are Asian: Japan, China, South and North (!) Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and the winner--Hong Kong! \n \n Whites are several points behind, a mediciore lot, really. But the difference between the average person in Hong Kong and the average Black American is enormous--almost 2 standard deviations! By the way the highest group in the world are Sephardic Jews who are more than 2 standard deviations higher than blacks. \n \n And who are the wealthiest ethnic groups in America? Those evil oppressive Waspy whites, right? Wrong again, the wealthiest group is Jewish Americans, then all those Asian groups I just mentioned: Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese, Korean, and Hong Kong. Groups with lower than average IQs are: Hispanics, American Indians, and blacks. Hmmm, funny how wealth maps perfectly with IQs across ethnic groups....\n \n Let me see, those Lefty writers tell us how whites thirsty for the blood of non-whites treated the Chinese like animals, the Jews were called Christ Killers and kept out of elite schools and country clubs, and the U.S. interned the Japanese in concentrating camps just like the Nazis did. So those groups must be poor as hell in contemporary America....\n \n Now we all know that Ms. Mizmaxx is not going to believe this IQ stuff if God herself came down, made an appearance, and told her it was true. (From the way she talks, my guess is that her god is W.E.B. Dubois--maybe Malcolm X is his Son?)). But the rest of you are open-minded folks. You tell me, what was your experience in school? Did black students as a group do as well in class as whites on average? In my 32 years of being around schools, I have observed a couple things: it varies across individuals, there are plenty of good and bad students among both groups. But there are also many blacks who make very good incomes. But there is a very clear tendency for blacks to not do as well, especially at complex stuff. They tend to be better than whites students at negotiating for better grades, but plainly their academic performance tends to be not as good.",

   "Galton, according to Occam's razor, many conclusions could be made. Such as, for instance, that Black people are impoverished due to centuries of overt economic suppression, for example.\n \n When faced with the facts, if all you can do is argue that Black people are less intelligent, how can this discussion serve any purpose? Very few reputable scientists give Jensen the time of day, and although you might ignore Occam's razor and contend that this is due to an elaborate feminist-Black conspiracy, the truth is that it's just because his theories are bunk. Your (and Jensen's) IQ theories are self-fulfilling, and the fact that \"model minorities\" do well is only further evidence.\n \n I admit that info on this subject is at my fingertips at the moment, because I'm reading a book on American Settlers. Still, I find it interesting that you have put forth your theories on settlerism and slavery without having any direct sources to back it up. The fact is that, like it or not, you're just regurgitating the \"Pioneer\" tales you've always heard but never bothered to investigate their validity.

The stereotypes that white Americans laid on now successful minority when they first arrived here were negative (e.g. \"Jews killed Christ and are cliquish\") but these groups outcompeted white gentiles anyway. Stereotypes we form of people follow  behavior, they do not precede it. They are crude (and therefore inaccurate) generalizations that bubble up from experiences. There are dozens of countries around the world that score below average on these non-verbal IQ tests. Are all these countries underperforming because white Americans think they are dumb? Are the Chinese in China kicking American butt because we Americans think they are so smart? \n \n \n\n I admit that info on this subject is at my fingertips at the moment, because I'm reading a book on American Settlers.

You said \"Black slaves were complacent and rarely resisted\" and \"White people bled and died in the Civil War to free Black people from slavery\", I gave data that showed that slave resistance was regular and that Northern settler abolitionism was self-serving and geared to reducing the Black population.

I certainly never said White people are \"Evil\" or anything of that nature. I simply believe that it is important to understand history in order to understand the present. I think it's better to be honest about historical trends and motivations, especially if we want to learn to avoid such behavior in the future. \n \n For example, it is important to study the Holocaust in order to understand how this can be avoided in the future. Study of the non-Jewish German population's participation in the Holocaust does not mean that \"Germans are Evil\". If individual Germans feel defensive and guilty about things which they have done, or things which occured before they were born, that's their problem.\n \n \n \nand I'll keep refuting them with scientific research.\n\n So far you haven't responded to any of my historical facts with any research, the only research you have presented is Jensen's.

   "So Chinese and Jewish people are smarter than White people?\n\n First of all, I'm not sure if anyone has told you, but *in a whisper* Jews are white.

You say spanking is an assault worse than against an adult, it is the worst act of cowardice (we usually hear these words for terrorists) but I'm just making things up when I say you want to criminalize spanking. You say that all white people in America, have enriched themselves on the blood of slaves, many of them knowing full well what they were doing, but I am making things up when I say you think white Americans are evil. What would you call people who deliberately enrich themselves on the blood and suffering of others--naughty?\n \n \n\n So far you haven't responded to any of my historical facts with any research, the only research you have presented is Jensen's.

Who else do you put forward, aside from Jensen?\n\n You obviously weren't reading carefully. I cited Linda Gottfredson's website which list many studies. The g Factor is a book, not one study, which reviews hundreds and hundreds of studies by many, many different people. In fact, in a survey of 600 psychometricians (Mark Snyderman and Stanley Rothman. The IQ Controversy, the Media, and Public Policy. New Brunswick, N. J.: Transaction Publishers, 1988.) the overwhelming majority of them agreed that IQ tests are not biased and that the observed diffferences between blacks and whites are real and enduring. The authors learned that the view by psychometricians is not better known because of reluctance to talk about it and because of selective media attention.",

   "And second of all, duh--didn't I just write that Asians and Jews were smarter than white gentiles?\n\n No, you've said \"whites\" when speaking in general, then \"waspy whites\" when discussing differences between Jewish people and gentiles.\n \n Anyway, the science behind this is extremely flawed. For example, when mapping income levels of East Asian populations the extreme economic disparity in some countries makes the \"average\" income is a useless number to determine correlation let alone causality. There are several points of this nature, but these are less important than the major flaw in this research, that is the idea that IQ testing can determine intelligence. \n \n First of all, IQ tests, despite the misnomer, were not created with the intention to test intelligence. \n \nThe psychometric approach was developed by Alfred Binet in 1904 to identify mentally retarded students who would benefit from special education. He designed the test to be an indicator of school performance and measured skills such as vocabulary, comprehension, and verbal relations.\n\n \n Second, few social scientists with any degree of respectability would claim that IQ or any other form of testing can determine \"general intelligence\", or that such a thing even exists. Most \"intelligence experts\" believe that intelligence comes in many forms, and ability to perform well in school is only one of them. Many celebrated thinkers such as Einstein and Mark Twain did very poorly in school. As for myself, I was consistently an honor-roll student. So, either I'm exceptionally smart, or school isn't everything. You can't both contend that I'm dumb and school performance is an indicator of general intelligence. Either have your cake or eat it.",
