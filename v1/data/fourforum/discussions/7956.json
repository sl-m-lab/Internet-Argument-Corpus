   "It's Easter Day, so of course, it must be religious day. Panel of reps of the various religions: Rabbi Lerner, I think, writer of progressive religious tomes; two Catholics, Neubau, converted from Lutheranism, radically opposed to Vietnam war when a Lutheran, converted to Catholicism, supported Ratzinger, now iffy and a Sister Joan something or other who appears to support openness to all religion, she and the good Father almost duking it out at one point, she, however, accused Democrats of lacking the \"aura\" of religion, she lives by the teachings of the Beatitudes; a Pastor O'Steen, of a huge church in Texas; a token Muslim, very progressive in his views, it seems.\n \n At any rate, Sister Joan was good enough to condemn corporatism and capitalism as the ultimate destroyer of American familes but I disagree her on her assessment of Democrats, unless she was referring to appearance only.\n \n Democrats continuously manifest the teachings of Christ by not loudly proclaiming their faith:\n \n Therefore, when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they have glory of men. Verily they have their reward. . . .\n \n And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men. Verily, I say unto you, They have their reward. . . .\n \n For the ill-informed the previous verses are in the sixth chapter of Matthew in the New Testament. Most Christians seem to be woefully ill-informed of this profound teaching. \n \n Furthermore, the Beatitudes:\n \n Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n \n Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.\n \n Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\n \n Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.\n \n Blessed are the merciful:for they shall obtain mercy.\n \n Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.\n \n Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.\n \n Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteouness sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n \n Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.\n \n To me it seems, Democrats are the most faithful to the beatitudes and the teachings of Christ. Which goes to prove even more that there ain't no God because there sure as hell has been a lot of persecution of Democrats, liberals, leftists, all those folks who follow the teachings of Christ truly, whether consciously or not, as their religion or not, and there ain't been no retribution.\n \n And, I'm tired of hearing about Democrats \"NOT BEING RELIGIOUS!\"\n \n Here endeth the lesson. Put something in the collection plate as you leave, thank you.",

No doctrinal integrity, no spiritual depth, and no rebuke of sin.\n\n \n Actually, I would suggest it is the protestant conservative evangelicals who are self-serving. They don't believe in helping the poor so that the poor are better off, only because it allows them to be chartiable. They don't believe in preaching the Gospel in order to help others come to Christ, only so they can say they have preached it and condemn others for not believing.\n \n Anglicanism is what most people think of when you say liberal Christianity, yet look at the leaders of Anglicanism in England, Rowan Williams and John Sentamu. Try applying your criticisms to them, it just doesn't fit.",
