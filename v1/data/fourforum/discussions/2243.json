   "Why not? What evidence is there that possession must be invited?\n\n The old Faustian bargain I suppose would be the closest- perhaps offering the demon experience of the world outside Hell in return for its powers, though this would be closer to a dark symbiosis rather than full possession. Perhaps the possession could occur if the host is not storng enough to resist (and forgot to add a no possession clause into the contract) or when the host sleeps.\n \n However it seems that over all demons are very respectful of the law, seeing as they are bound by contracts and don't break them (but trick you into signing bad ones)...and there is the fact that most were probably lawyers in a previous life;)\n So not all your rebelious and antisocial behaviour, Rapture, can be blamed on demons.",

Demons do not control mortal lives as they are not capable of controlling them. They are the tempter (sp?), and we have the choice to give into their influence.
