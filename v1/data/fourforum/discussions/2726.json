I agree. That is why a war in Iraq is much easier vs a war in Korea. Waging war against the regime in Iraq is much easier vs a war against the regime in Korea. The North Koreans love thier regime. Waging a war against the objects in North Korea makes as much sense as gun control. Even if the WMDs in North Korea are gone, the people are still unchanged. Same with gun control. Take the guns, murderers are still murderers.",

We don't do that in this country and such an idea is dangerous to our democracy. In this country all people are innocent until proven in a court beyond a doubt. Under Napelonic code the police are suspicious you go to jail and you have to prove that they were wrong. In practice your guilty first then innocent later and the critera for guilt is very low. Under that system all people are guilty, suspicous, and potential criminals. In the USA we don't do that and such a practice is undemocratic under our system.\n \n Yes we do restrict dangerous people to make them harmless.
