Just as Moby Dick is a whale hunted by Captain Ahab, and Huck Finn and Jim rafted down the Mississippi, God and Jesus are literary characters in a great fiction...\n\n Herman Melville fictionalised a true and horrifying incident concerning the whaleship Essex out of Nantucket. If you get chance, read The Whaleship Essex: The True Story of Moby Dick or one similarly titled.\n \n The above in no way supports Biblical accounts: what the theist so often fails to realise is that so many Biblical themes are repeated throughout history and across many cultures. A cursory glance at flood accounts lends credence to the notion of a world-wide flood, but if the flood occurred only 4000 years or so ago, why are the accounts, when examined, so disparate?\n \n As another example, there have been many Messiahs throughout history, all similarly described and predating Christ, all involving wise men of sorts, stars, astrology, virgin births, preaching, miracles, human sacrifice, death and resurrection etc. The Bible does not stand above or apart from any of these. It's a fascinating book from a historical and literary context, and for that reason should not be dismissed, but to shape one's life around it...",

   "I believe there is evidence of massive flooding in different areas of the world at different times.\n Not long ago, I saw a PBS documentary on how a massive flood occurred in north america when a glacial ice dam wall broke up north, releasing an ocean of water into the US area resulting in interesting erosion and geological formations.\n \n Think of the movie Ice Age II the meltdown.\n \n What most apologist do is take these events and stories told (accurate or exagerated) and piece them together to support a 'global flood' story.",
