   "Why should \"mental existence\" be so critical as to determine the main criteria for rights to life?\n \n My arguement would be that mental existence forms the very core of what we are as people. Without that mental existence, \"we\" no longer exist. That is why it is so very critical. One can argue the potential of an early fetus, but until it gains that mental existence, there is \"nobody home\" and it is just a body - essentially, at that moment, an object. Many, including myself, would give value to it because of its potential to become more (in gaining that essence of what it is to be a person - i.e. mental existence) but, until that point, potential is all it has. I and most pro-choice advocates value that potential much less than we value the rights of the mother to her own body.\n \n So.. why is mental existence the core or essence of personhood? What do we think of when we think \"I\" and what is the core of ourselves that we cannot do without and still exist?\n \n I understand that, in the general sense of the word \"I\", one would include ones body. After all, when I look at a mirror and see my physical body, I think of that as \"me\". \n \n What I am trying to get at is the essence or core of that sense of self. Essentially, the question is: \"What can you subtract from yourself and still exist?\". If you lose an arm, \"you\" still exist. The same is true for any other part of the body except for the functioning brain that gives you your mental processes. It is ultimately that mental existence that is at the very core of what we are. You can lose everything else and still exist as a being, as a \"someone\". Once you lose that mental existence, then there is no someone left - just a body. \n \n What aspects of yourself, in your view(s), are absolutely essential for you to exist?",

In their case I would ask them if they value a person who was recently deceased, where the cells of the body are still living, but there is no mental existence. I also beleive you are right in saying most pro-choicers do not place as high a value on a foetus (which is not a person) as they do on the woman (who is a fully developed person). There is not as much of an empathy toward the foetus as it is not a person, and not as valuable as the woman. Since it is growing in the woman, it only makes sense that she decide what to do as it is her body.",

Am I incorrect in this analysis of your arguement? \n \n The reason that I and Shooterandproud brought out the sci-fi scenario of a brain sustained on its own is to prove the point that the mental processes are ultimately what forms the very core of ourselves. Unfortunately, one has to go to the levels of hypotheticals and philosophy to address this question since reality does not present us with such extremes by which we can judge.\n \n As for the mind being regulated by the brain, then the arguement is that the core of our existence is indeed the mental existence but that the sufficiently developed brain is necessary for that mental existence. The physical brain then does not have much worth on its own except for its function to generate our mental existence. Do you agree? \n \n One could go into philosophical hypotheticals of mind independent of body but already you seem to have admitted that the main core of ourselves are our minds and the use of body is to support that mind. All of this goes straight to my arguement about when we as people start and end our existence. Namely, we start to exist as people when our minds start to exist. Agreed?\n \nIf you believe that it is the development of thinking ability that makes a human count as a life with rights, it seems reasonable to think that people with superior thinking ability would have superior rights.\n\n It is not degree of mental existence I am arguing - it is any mental existence AT ALL. This is the loosest criteria I can logically present. Once some level of mental existence kicks in, then, yes, there are various degrees of mental ability that can also be used as criteria. That is not what I am presenting. I am not presenting QUALITY of mind. I am presenting the very EXISTENCE of mind. \n \n Yes, the mind is a physical development, but so is conception. They are both physical changes and the choice of either development constitutes a moral choice on our part which development we think leads to the critical criteria. For me, mental existence is the critical criteria since it is when I view myself as having started my own existence.

   "If you believe that it is the development of thinking ability that makes a human count as a life with rights, it seems reasonable to think that people with superior thinking ability would have superior rights.\n\n \n I didn't say anything about superior intellect. But, if a life form is not a \"someone\" or a sentient life form like the rest of us, then why should it share rights? It doesn't care if it has them or not. It doesn't even know it has them. Rights are for sentient beings, not clumps of cells. Its the same reason dead people don't share the same rights as living people. Its the same reason animals have more rights than plants.",

Well, you can't live with out your heart, lungs, brain, spinal cord, etc. I dont' see self as what you can take away and live with...yourself is just what you are at that time...if you have a brain and 3 legs then YOU are a brain with 3 legs. \n\n The question is - \"What can you take away and still be exist?\" not \"What are you now?\". If you lose your legs, you are still you - just less capable than you used to be.

The situation you gave would probably not lend itself to being a \"you\" but someone born with half a brain and needed the second half to live (or whatever) and they received a fake half a brain...I would still say this is a \"you\". \n\n This brings up a whole host of issues. I think I would agree that, if you could transfer that mental existence continuously partly into an artificial brain, where you are not re-creating that person, then I would probably agree that \"you\" still exist. I can't imagine how that would be done, but we are arguing hypotheticals here. Alternatively, if you just reproduced the same mental processes in a new artificial brain, then others might see that as you but you would no longer exist - just someone new who thinks they are you. The same issue came up once on a hypothetical discussion of teleportation (i.e. \"beam me up, Scotty\"). Anyway, for me, it would be the continuation of that particular mental existence that would keep \"you\" existing.\n \nIf a brain were only a brain left in a jar but kept alive then I would not say this is a \"you\". \n \n But once again, the \"you\" is not made up of what you contain or have (a leg, arm, or brain)...it is more than this.

A computer with a broken CPU is still a computer but a working CPU by itself is not a computer.\n\n Why do you say that? If all that was left of you was your functioning brain, then you could still dream, imagine, think, feel emotions of anger, joy, love, etc., analyze, have creativity, enjoy your memories, etc. You would be VERY limited in what you could DO and would probably be pretty lonely, but you would certainly still be around.",
