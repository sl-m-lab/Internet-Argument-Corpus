   "New data from polling firm Gallup shows that out of all the religious groups in the U.S., Muslims are most likely to reject violence, followed by the non-religious atheists and agnostics.\n \n Through interviews with 2,482 Americans, Gallup found that 78 percent of Muslims believe violence which kills civilians is never justified, whereas just 38 percent of Protestant Christians and 39 percent of Catholics agreed with that sentiment. Fifty-six percent of atheists answered similarly.\n\n Poll: Muslims, atheists most likely to reject violence | The Raw Story\n \n Ah, the good old Christian lust for bloodshed. Something to do with the Rite of the Eucharist, I believe. And that bloody, gory film by Mel Gibson, The Passion:\n \nEver since his star began to rise after the 1979 Australian thriller Mad Max, Mel Gibson hasn't seemed fully alive on screen unless he's being tortured and mutilated. In the Road Warrior and Lethal Weapon films, as well as such one-shots as Conspiracy Theory (1997) and The Patriot (2000), Gibson courted martyrdom, and he achieved it. He won an Oscar for his labors in Braveheart (1995), which ends with its hero managing to scream \"FREEEEE-DOM!!\" as he's drawn and quartered. Gibson snatched the pulp movie Payback (1999) away from its writer-director, Brian Helgeland, to make the torture of his character even more gruelingly explicit: He added shots of his toes being smashed by an iron hammer. Payback: That's what almost all of Gibson's movies are about (including his 1990 Hamlet.) Even if he begins as a man of peace, Mad Mel ends as a savage revenger.\n \n A devout Catholic-albeit one who believes that Vatican II, which formally absolved the Jews of responsibility for the death of Jesus, is illegitimate-Gibson has said that what moves him most about the Christ story is that Jesus was whipped, scourged, mocked, spat on, had spikes driven through his hands and feet, and was left to die on the cross-and that he didn't think of payback; he thought of forgiveness. But by wallowing in his torture and death for two hours, the director of The Passion of the Christ (Newmarket) suggests that he's thinking of anything but.\n\n The Passion, Mel Gibson's bloody mess. - By David Edelstein - Slate Magazine\n \n I think Uncle Mel is a good candidate for joining the flagellant community.",

   "All Muslims aren't responsible for violence and terrorism, and neither are all Christians (or any other religious group), but with as many Muslim-related terrorist attacks, acts of violence, and more (with the terrorist attacks specifically targeting civilians) that we have seen, it seems pretty dumb to point to a poll to try to prove that it's a peace-loving religion... I really don't understand why so many atheists try to stand up for Islam all the time.\n \n At best, you can say that American Muslims say that they are more peace-loving than American Christians, but even then it's just a random poll with a very small sample size (with less than 2,500 total interviews, how many Muslims could there possibly have been? Muslims make up less than 1% of Americans, and if that ratio was true for the poll, you'd be talking about a whopping 20 people.) It's also got some built in bias since Muslims are obviously going to be more sensitive to the issue (they likely have to deal with prejudice all the time thanks to acts of terrorism.)",

However the Gallup poll that has been presented amounts to not one of these standards.\n \n To believe the presented numbers are accurate one must first believe that those polled were completely honest when randomly asked questions by complete strangers. In other words we would need to believe that nobody lied.\n \n There is also a lack of the exact questions asked, leaving us with only what the report tells us what was asked. However word structure can affect the results greatly depending on how something was asked.\n \n Simply because muslims in America claim to not support the targeting of civilians, that in no way suggests muslims outside of America share the same sentiments, nor should it be taken to suggest such. How many of those asked were devout practitioners or Sharia law and believed it was perfectly alright to execute someone for claiming Mohammed was no prophet? How many of those polled still believed in women being kept illiterate? Who among them supported the practice of female circumcision? Of those polled how many believed the message of Allah must be spread through force if necessary?\n \n The presented poll is insufficient to be considered as hard facts in answering the question, or painting any sort of accurate picture.",
