And the government would \"devalue human life\" by letting these companies operate under it. We do not go targeting innocent civilians.

Would you tell the nearly 3000 innocent 9/11 victims' families that we \"value human life\", so we are not going to invade Afghanistan or Iraq because we don't want to cause ANY innocent deaths (by the way, you seem to not have a problem with the innocent citizens who were killed in Afghanistan?). We also valued the 200,000 or more innocent Iraqis, 700,000 Iranis, 1000 Kuwaitis, and 100,000 Kurds who were killed by Saddam. We also valued the 300 US servicemen who died in the First Gulf War, caused by Saddam. We also valued the 100,000 Iraqis who died and the 300,000 who were injured because of Saddam's defiance in invading Kuwait. We also valued the thousands of innocent Israelis killed by Palestinian suicide bombers whose families were compensated for the child's act by Saddam, thus encouraging more attacks world-wide. Would you suggest, that since you claim we \"devalue human lives\" so much, that we just allow terrorists and those who aid and abet them to attack us with no response?\n \n \n \nIraqi citizens, at the present, are living in fear that they will be the next victim of an insurgent's bomb or stray fire from US troops.

Living for the rest of their lives under a brutal dictator who would kill or torture them if they spoke out against him or his religion, or living a few months under fear and then having the opportunity to vote for a President (which many of them have never done), practice religion freely, dress freely, speak freely, and live without the fear of their leader wanting to oppress them. I'm sure any sane Iraqi would pick the latter.\n \n This may show a lack on sensitivity, but wouldn't a reporter with any common sense leave the scene of a gunfight between the US and Iraqis? Wouldn't a car being blown up, people throwing rocks at it, and a US helicopter flying above deter most normal reporters and give the clue that it's time to leave the scene? You put your own life in danger when you sit beside a US truck that was just blown up by \"insurgents\".\n \n \n \nIn the process, we are also eliminating the lives of children. We have already maimed and killed thousands of them. These children and their dead mothers cannot enjoy any life with \"freedom\" or anything else.\n\n \n \n Though we have no reports of the exact number of innocent Iraqi civilians killed, it has been estimated to be 13,000, which also includes deaths by the hands of \"insurgents\". I would bet any amount of money that we have killed nowhere near a thousand innocent children. If you ever read the news, you would know that. Most of those deaths occur by the scores from the hands of \"insurgents\", who for instance today killed about 50 innocent Iraqis waiting in line to sign up for the Police Department. Most of those deaths can be attributed to the hateful acts by \"insurgents\". I would also bet any amount of money that thousands more children died by the hands of Saddam than by accidental US instances. And they would NEVER live with any freedom under him, EVER. Wait, according to this source (http://www.moreorless.au.com/killers/hussein.htm), Saddam indirectly caused the deaths of 500,000 Iraqi children by his refusal to comply with UN resolutions and violating 18 of them, causing sanctions to be imposed.\n \n \n \nThere was an Iraqi teenager who lost his brother in the war. He said, \"I guess that's the price of freedom.\" When asked if he felt more free, he said, \"No way.\"\n\n \n \n Obviously, you can't please everyone!! That is just a story of one person. Why didn't you cite the statements of millions of Iraqis who praise our help in removing their totalitarian leader?\n \n \n \nAnyway, before the war machine started, everyone knew that there would be \"collateral damage.\" If someone starts an offensive war knowing full well that at least SOME children will be killed, most likely a large number, then that is devaluing innocent human life, period.\n\n \n \n Are you serious? These stats here are alarming, and according to your thinking, all of these acts were \"devaluing human lives\":\n \n \n In World War II, the US helped free the world from Nazi Germany, who intentionally murdered over 6 million Jews (including hundreds of thousands of CHILDREN) and millions of others. But in the process, 7.8 million INNOCENT CIVILIANS died in China, 2.8 million in Germany, 5.7 million in Poland, 17 million in the USSR, and 1.2 million in Yugoslavia. In total, over 37 million INNOCENT CIVILIANS died over the course of World War II. So you have a choice...you claim we are devaluing human lives. Well if that is the case, the Fuhrer executed about 10 million INNOCENT CIVILIANS. If you feel we need to value human life, shouldn't someone have ended that terrible thing called the Holocaust, the Khmer Rouge, and the Gulag? We did exactly that, but in the process of the war, nearly 40 million INNOCENT CIVILIANS died. Do you think the lives that were taken to end the Holocaust, Khmer Rouge, and the Gulag were devalued? If so, you would be against World War II, which would make you one of the few who do.\n \n By the way, there were twice as many innocent civilian deaths as soldier deaths in World War II. 37 millions innocent civilians died, compared with only 17 million soldiers dead. There were 2 choices: let Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, Pol Pot, and Hirohito continue to massacre their citizens and attempt to conquer the world, or do something about it.

We KNEW civilians were there. We dropped four 2000lb bunker buster bombs on/around the restaurant. \n We KNEW that civilians would be killed. We knew that by pressing the button, the bomb would be dropped and people would die.\n \n Compare that to the manufacturers. They make products that people use in their daily lifes.

This is the difference between a defensive war and an offensive one. We had to invade Afghanistan. We had to root out Al-Qaida and even the Taliban. This was unavoidable. They struck us and we had to defend ourselves.\n \n Tell me how offensively attacking and invading Iraq did anything to protect the 280 million lives here. The 1000s of people killed by Saddam were almost exclusively killed before 1991, when we were supplying Saddam with weapons and money. Tell me how we valued their lives again.\n \n \n \nWhich do they fear more? Living for the rest of their lives under a brutal dictator who would kill or torture them if they spoke out against him or his religion, or living a few months under fear and then having the opportunity to vote for a President (which many of them have never done), practice religion freely, dress freely, speak freely, and live without the fear of their leader wanting to oppress them. I'm sure any sane Iraqi would pick the latter.\n\n Who the dead? I don't think they fear anything anymore. They get no democracy. They pay the price for their brothers and sisters to have \"democracy.\" The insurgents are fighting US for their freedom from US. \n \n Iraq was not Saudi Arabia. Women could dress mostly how they pleased (much like here). People were free to practice their religion. There were plenty of christian churches in Baghdad. Islam will still be there, and in full effect. If Islamic law is allowed to gain more and more strength, then women, and people in general, will eventually have less freedom, like in most of Saudi Arabia. \n \n The one thing they will be able to do (maybe) is bitch about the government, and just like here, they won't be able to do much about it.

You put your own life in danger when you sit beside a US truck that was just blown up by \"insurgents\".\n\n \n It was a vehicle sitting in the middle of the street in a residential area of Baghdad. It had been burning in the street all that day. There were kids and people gathered around it. The reporter was reporting on the event when a helicopter circling overhead (likely seeing the 20 or so people including kids hanging around the street around it.) The helicopter fired a missile at the vehicle for some reason. Who knew that a helicopter would fire a missile into a crowd of civilians? (Well, you're right, we;ve been doing that the whole time, they should have known better.)\n \n \n\n Though we have no reports of the exact number of innocent Iraqi civilians killed, it has been estimated to be 13,000, which also includes deaths by the hands of \"insurgents\". I would bet any amount of money that we have killed nowhere near a thousand innocent children.

The US can do that with one bomb. This is great. Most of the deaths that we caused were done during the \"major combat operations\" That's when we rang up the 10-15,000 civilian casualties. Insurgents haven't even come close.\n \n The sanctions AND Saddam's actions with them caused people to starve and go without medical treatment. Yes, I agree, the sanctions were a bad idea.\n \n \n\n Obviously, you can't please everyone!! That is just a story of one person. Why didn't you cite the statements of millions of Iraqis who praise our help in removing their totalitarian leader?\n\n Actually the kid was on a panel, all pretty much saying the same thing. \n \n Why didn't YOU cite them? \n \n\n Are you serious?

   "Not a valid analogy. WWII wasn't about saving the Jews. Iraq is about saving the Iraqis. At least now it is. It didn't start out that way. The question is, going forward from here, in terms of innocent life, how will history judge the cost/benefit. How will the Iraqis judge the cost/benefit. Will they call this their halocaust?\n\n \n \n \n Actually, it's a great analogy. We went to war in WWII in retaliation for an attack on our country, much like we are in Iraq (not that I am saying Iraq had anything to do with 9/11). We attacked Germany in WWII because they were allied with Japan, much like how Saddam had connections with and/or ties with Bin Laden, Al Qaeda, Al-Aksa Martyr's Brigade, Hezbollah, Ansar al Islam, paying families of Palestinian suicide bombers, etc. We didn't go into WWII looking for Holocaust graves, much like we didn't go into Iraq with the primary intent of searching for mass graves. But in the process of WWII, we uncovered mass graves of Jews. In the process of invading Iraq, we found mass graves of Iraqis.\n \n \n \nObviously, from your statement you take the position that we've got to break a few eggs. Eggs. What an interesting word considering that the original question was about abortion.\n\n \n \n Look at the original question. It was \"Are those who are pro-life hypocrites because if they support the war in Iraq?\" How can you even make a connection like that? That's absurd.\n \n \n \nCan we just deal in the today - here and now. Today, there is an Iraqi, an actual real human being, who's \"collateral damage\". Today, there's an unborn child (I love that politically correct phrase), which, in truth nothing more than a couple of cells. If you're prolife then be prolife. Pick a side. At least try to muster a little sympathy for the innocent dead.\n\n \n \n I never said I didn't care about the innocent dead. But in every war, people are going to die. It's a simple fact. Much like in the US Revolutionary War, people had to give up their lives for the freedoms of their future generations. I'm sure if those who died in Iraq could look into the future 100 years away and see their great grandchildren living in peace and freedom, they would be happy. But I have no sympathy for Islamic extremists who pose a threat to the security of this world. I hope they all drop dead.",

   "Actually, it's a great analogy.\n\n \n But the bottom line purpose of WWII was to contain Germany. The fight was over borders. There is no land in Iraq at stake.\n \n \nmuch like how Saddam had connections with and/or ties with Bin Laden, Al Qaeda, Al-Aksa Martyr's Brigade, Hezbollah, Ansar al Islam, paying families of Palestinian suicide bombers, etc.\n\n \n Exactly what connections he had and with whom is yet to be determined. Evidently, his check book is missing.\n \n \nLook at the original question. It was \"Are those who are pro-life hypocrites because if they support the war in Iraq?\" How can you even make a connection like that? That's absurd.\n\n \n Look at the original question. Exactly. \"Are those who are pro-life hypocrites because if they support the war in Iraq?\" It's a theoretical question. Much like ,\"how can a person be pro-life and pro-death penalty.\" And I find both questions fascinating.\n \n \nBut in every war, people are going to die. It's a simple fact. Much like in the US Revolutionary War, people had to give up their lives for the freedoms of their future generations.\n\n \n This isn't a Revolution. They didn't start it. We did. Unlike the Revolutionary War, they didn't make that choice. We did.\n \n \nI'm sure if those who died in Iraq could look into the future 100 years away and see their great grandchildren living in peace and freedom, they would be happy.\n\n \n I wish I had your confidence that it will turn out that way.\n \n \nBut I have no sympathy for Islamic extremists who pose a threat to the security of this world. I hope they all drop dead.\n\n \n If I expand your sentence slightly, I'll agree. But I have no sympathy for terrorists who pose a threat to anyone. Terrorism isn't limited to Islamics.\n \n ---------------------------------------\n \n Now back to the original question. Certainly the question contains the word IRAQ and therefore loads it politically, but since this is the abortion thread, I see the question as one of what makes a fetus more innocent than a victim of war - any war. Who determines innocence, us or God, and when is that innocence lost? If a person believes that a fetus is a God given life and abortion is murder, how can we shrug our shoulders and say:\n \n \nBut in every war, people are going to die. It's a simple fact.\n\n \n My personal position is pro-choice and anti-war. Not an easy spot either. So have at it.",

   "Hello,\n \n I think that is is at least a double standard to oppose abortion and embryonic stem cell research and then to authorize, plan, and execute an offensive war.\n \n It makes no sense to value unborn life and then devalue fully functioning human life. \n \n Am I the only one who sees a conflict here?\n\n \n Well, the people in Iraqu that we are killing are terrorists that just want to make chaos so they can come to power in the confution. We also went to war to remove Saadam from power. He killed 200,000 people. most of them were tortured to death. So yes it makes more sense to kill terrorists that are trying to kill as many people as possible than to kill little children that have not been born. Besides, babies are so cute :p",

   "Getting back to the original question...yes, i think it is very reasonable to be against abortion and for a war. I don't thin anybody is \"for war\", but rather \"for a war\".

However, I also don't believe you can compare the War in Iraq to Vietnam, like some liverals do. Again, evaluate each one differently.\n \n For a second here, let's forget a few things about Iraq.

   "Getting back to the original question...yes, i think it is very reasonable to be against abortion and for a war. I don't thin anybody is \"for war\", but rather \"for a war\". Each one is different and needs to be evaluated separately. \n\n Just like no one is really \"for\" abortions, but they think that it's the woman's right to decide. Maybe that's like when congress gave the President the right to decide to go to war, even when they were supposed to declare war.\n \n\n I don't believe you can compare WWII with the War in Iraq, like some conservatives do. However, I also don't believe you can compare the War in Iraq to Vietnam, like some liverals do. Again, evaluate each one differently.\n\n Ok, great. It's obvious that this war is nothing like WWII. Comparisons to Vietnam are a little more accurate, but they just aren't the same, obviously.\n \n \nFor a second here, let's forget a few things about Iraq. Let's forget anything we've ever heard or read about<b></b>: weapons of mass destruction, alledged ties between bin laden and hussein, and anything you saw in farenheit 9/11. Let's look at Iraq in general and the things we know:\n \n First, Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction at some time. We don't know what he did with them, we know he had them. Also, realize that the term \"weapons of mass destruction\" can be deceiving.\n\n What does this have to do with the topic?\n \n \nSecond, Hussein did kill at the minimum 300,000 Iraquis, a lot of them women and children. Much of this was in gas chamber and other unbearable ways to die.\n\n You don't really know that.\n Go to North Korea and ask how many South Korean children George Bush has killed and they will tell you millions. Ask them how long it will be until american missionaries and soldiers will come to kill them all and take their country and they will tell you it could happen at any time. That's why they would be ready to go to war.\n \n\n Third, most Iraquis did not like Saddam Hussein. That's well-known among our media and military members overseas, the problem is getting the Iraquis to believe that Hussein will never be in power again to punish them if they speak up. They are finally beginning to.\n\n I wonder how many of those that didn't like him were killed by our bombs.\n And they are \"speaking up\" by hurling mortars and rockets at our soldiers and planting bombs in the street for them.\n \n\n Fourth, other atrocious acts were performed by Hussein as well as his sons, i.e. boasting of different sexual crimes committed. One story which recently broke was that of his two sons being known to drive around and occasionally rape women along the side of the road that they saw.\n \n In the end, we need to ask ourselves if these things were enough of a reason to go to Iraq.\n\n If those were the reasons for invading and occupying Iraq and killing its citizens then why did we stop there? Why didn't we invade other countries that do the same or worse to their people? Why didn't we invade the country when all that stuff was at its peak, like 15 years ago? \n Right now (if we are to believe these things) North Korea is testing chemical and biological agents on people, usually a family (mom dad kids) in their concentration camps, and this has been going on for years. They are proud of their new nuclear weapons and they would use them in offense or defense against the US. they are also proud of their million man army that's one of the best trained and equipped in the world. There's your weapons of mass destruction and atrocious acts.\n \n Now, getting back to the topic. You are saying that in order to save lives we must sacrifice lives. According to George Bush, that's a dilemma. He even said in the second debate. \"To destroy life to save life is -- it's one of the real ethical dilemmas that we face.\" Now, what do you make of that?\n \n Do you really think he wrestled with destroying life to invade Iraq? Are you sure that since he did it so quickly after congress gave him the blank check that he lost sleep over it? \n \n .",
