   "Reproduced below is the full text of a resolution passed in 1990 by the Evangelical Methodist Church re: homosexuality and posted on that church's website. Visit the original web text at: http://www.emchurch.org/homosex.htm. The following interpretive argument, to which I'd appreciate readers' reaction, is founded on that text, and on its larger context. \n \n CAUTION... \n First, let's get out of the way what I will NOT here be arguing. I will NOT be arguing that homosexual acts are tolerable, desirable, permissible, not sinful, or anything of the sort. I shall not here be engaging in that argument, or making such assertions, at all. \n \n REVIEW AND INTERPRETATION... \n \n \"Whereas the Biblical record clearly condemns homosexual activity...\" the resolution says, quoting inter alia Leviticus 18:22, Romans 1:26, I Corinthians 6:9, 10. \n \n Therefore, the resolution continues, \"we, the [EMC], believe homosexual practices to be sin...Moreover, we agree that no individual who practices homosexual acts shall be permitted to be an official member of any [EMC]; nor shall any known practicing homosexual be a candidate for the [EMC] ministry...\" \n \n So far, the emphasis is on the behavioural sin--\"homosexual activity.\" \n \n But observe the elision in the next sentence...\"Therefore, any person who does not positively affirm that [s/he] is not a homosexual may not become a member of the Evangelical Methodist Church.\" [bold added] \n \n The reference has shifted from practice or act to status: \"is not a homosexual.\" \n \n A case to consider...Chris, let's say, had been practising homosexual acts for quite some time. Strongly same-sex oriented, a fairly out-of-the-closet member of the local gay community, and, let us hypothesize, irresponsibly promiscuous. Chris then acquires Christian religious belief, let's say, and further comes to the heartfelt belief that homosexual acts are sinful. However, Chris, even while moving forward into what feels a fuller Christian walk, nonetheless feels the tug back to \"the life.\" White-knuckles it sometimes. As time goes on, the tug lessens, the walk forward becomes more confident. But, like the recovering alcoholic who, even after years clean, sometimes feels the tug, Chris still feels it, too. Feeling ready to stand before the congregation, Chris has now been free for, say, three years or more from commiting homosexual acts. But still feels homosexually oriented. \"Like a cancer in remission,\" Chris might say: \"Not active--well under control--but still, somehow, THERE.\" Chris feels that, in an important sense, he \"couldn't truthfully say, 'I'm not A HOMOSEXUAL'.\" But, says Chris, \"I do acknowledge the practice as a sin. Prayer is pulling me along. And I've been free of the practice for years, now.\" \n \n QUESTION: Can the church admit Chris? If Chris can't claim being \"not a homosexual,\" apparently not. \n \n PROBLEM: The church's resolution appears to have elided practice and status. \n \n NOW, IT GETS WORSE...The resolution proceeds: \n \"Whereas we recognize that the Bible verifies that homosexuality is no greater sin than adultery, murder, stealing, etc., we, therefore, affirm that homosexuals are redeemable according to the Gospel of Jesus Christ...\" \n \n QUESTIONS: Does the resolution contradict itself? If the homosexual is \"redeemable,\" then where? Not, apparently, in the church. \n \n NOTE: In a perhaps summative move, the resolution then states: \"[A]ll homosexuals who seek faith in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord, and cease to practice homosexual acts, the Evangelical Methodist Church welcomes into the fellowship of the Church.\" Two problems remain, however: (1) The resolution requires that one say s/he \"is not a homosexual,\" and (2) the homosexual, unlike other brands of sinner, must so declare as a condition of entry. \n \n WHY does the church single out this one sin, THEN assert that it's no worse than \"adultery, murder, stealing...\" Consider...Bob the alcoholic, now dry three years by the grace of God, will likely self-identify, for the rest of his life, as an alcoholic, even if he takes no drink. Yet Bob, whether or not he takes a drink, is not required, as a condition of entering the church, to assert even that he does not drink, let alone that he \"is not an alcoholic\"...Adulterer DAVE used to boink anything in a skirt, and indeed he still feels an urge re: that waitress at the truckstop, and just last week, well--he did it again. Yet he is required to make no declaration at the door...JENNIFER, a frequent shoplifter, faces no requirement to declare any past or present indulgence of that sin, as a condition for membership. \n \n If the sin of homosexuality (as either practice or self-identifier) requires such a declaration, yet is \"no worse than\" these other sins, why is ONLY homosexuality distinguished for such declaration? It does appear that the church in question has committed at least one unwitting error, setting up one set of sins as so distinct from others as to require swearing an oath, while erecting no screen at all for other sins. \n \n Why in heaven's name, I'm moved to ask, would a homosexual be attracted to this church? I know why sinners of other sorts are attracted--I'm one of those attracted sinners. I've no homosexual activity or orientation to confess--I feel fortunate in that! (Lots of other sins, though, for sure.) Curiously, too, our local church didn't ask me, didn't ask any of the other half dozen or so admitted when I was, to declare ourselves free of either homosexual activity or orientation--thereby certainly violating the mandate prescribed by the resolution. But in any event, I shake my head at the evident inconsistency or near-inconsistency of this official church position, and feel queasy about the church's asserting verbally that one sin is no worse than others while administratively singling it out for unique attention as a screen for church admission. \n \n I'd be grateful for the reactions of others. Thanks for reading. \n \n B \n \n \n \n \n \n CHURCH RESOLUTION BEGINS... \n \n \n \n Whereas the Biblical record clearly condemns homosexual activity: \n \n A. Leviticus 18:22, God reveals homosexual practice to be an abomination in His sight. \n \n B. Romans 1:26, 27 declares homosexual activity is a lust of the flesh which is unnatural, degrading, and totally contrary to God's will. \n \n C. I Corinthians 6:9, 10 reveals that homosexuals are to be denied entrance into the eternal Kingdom of Heaven if they do not repent, receive Christ as their personal Savior, and abolish their homosexual life-style, \n \n Therefore, by the authority of the Holy Scriptures, we, the Evangelical Methodist Church, believe homosexual practices to be sin leading to spiritual death and eternal punishment. Moreover, we agree that no individual who practices homosexual acts shall be permitted to be an official member of any Evangelical Methodist Church; nor shall any known practicing homosexual be a candidate for the licensed ministry of the Evangelical Methodist Church. Therefore, any person who does not positively affirm that he/she is not a homosexual may not become a member of the Evangelical Methodist Church. Every Board of Ministerial Relations and every local church pastor will ask for this affirmation during their respective interviews for licensing of ministers and the confirmation of church leaders. \n \n We, the Evangelical Methodist Church, uphold that all individuals are entitled to certain rights and protection of civil law; nevertheless, we oppose all civil legislation that supports homosexuality as a normal life-style based upon sexual preference. Moreover, the Evangelical Methodist Church opposes all civil legislation which would force us to compromise our religious beliefs on homosexuality. Hence, the Evangelical Methodist Church stands upon its constitutional right, under the first amendment, to oppose homosexual practices according to our religious conscience and Biblical understanding. \n \n Whereas we recognize that the Bible verifies that homosexuality is no greater sin than adultery, murder, stealing, etc., we, therefore, affirm that homosexuals are redeemable according to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Thus, we encourage all Evangelical Methodists to present God's plan of salvation and deliverance from sin to all homosexuals. Moreover, all homosexuals who seek faith in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord, and cease to practice homosexual acts, the Evangelical Methodist Church welcomes into the fellowship of the Church. \n \n The above resolution was passed by the General Conference of the Evangelical Methodist Church meeting; in Wilmore, Kentucky in July, 1990. \n \n CHURCH RESOLUTION ENDS",

   "This is a great example of why gay groups call churches homophobic. They are scared of an alcoholic but they must be scared of the homosexual. If you have committed adultry, as sin they say is equal to homosexuality, you are treated differently than a person who has committed their sin of homoexuality. \n \n This is the discrimination gays face everyday. Mixed messages and patronizing \"resolutions\". It is obvious this chruch is disciminating against homosexuals based on the fact the resolution contradicts itself on how homosexuals should be treated. Starting with homosexuals saying they are not homosexuals.",

   "\n QUESTION: Can the church admit Chris? If Chris can't claim being \"not a homosexual,\" apparently not. \n \n\n \n I can come up with an answer to this that at least makes some sense.

   "I agree with several things you've said.\n \n Yes, it is difficult not to sniff homophobia in this church's resolution.\n \n I suspect they do believe homosexuality, being a homosexual, EQUALS the act. Whether or not mistaken, this isn't a nonsensical view. If one hasn't pole-vaulted or collected stamps for thitry years, then we pretty much tend to say that she \"isn't a pole-vaulter,\" \"isn't a stamp collector.\" Members of this church, as I know them--I'm a member myself--would tend to think that homosexuality can be \"cured.\" They do tend to think the same of alcoholism. \"I understand you USED to be an alcoholic,\" they would say to such a person who is in recovery.\n \n Now, consider...Bob the recovering alcoholic goes to AA as well as to church. Indeed--typical case--Bob's growth in AA was indeed what brought him to theistic, then Christian, belief. Bob, whether or not mistaken in this view, and though it's contrary to the church's view, and though he's been happily, prayerfully dry for lots of years, BELIEVES himself an alcoholic, and would so state in the right circumstance. Chris, our homosexual, might have an exactly parallel case. Now, in Chris's situation, IS CHRIS LYING if Chris says, at the moment of membership oath-taking, \"I am not a homosexual\"?\n \n If we take the Evangelical Methodist Church's resolution as implicitly DEFINING that \"homosexual\" EQUALS \"now commits the act,\" then perhaps no problem, beyond a sloppily worded resolution. If, however, the elision complained of covers a distinction that remains real, then Chris's problem is real, and the Church has actually excluded people for their \"orientation,\" whether or not their sin be active.\n \n Then, of course, quite beyond the concern of poor wording, there's the distinct issue of why this particular sin is singled out from all others. (There is one parallel resolution, incidentally, on abortion--another topic.)\n \n The Church's remark about homsexuality being \"no worse than\" other listed sins feels rather self-serving, tucked in as it is near the resolution's end, with rather the flavour of afterthought. And it's a remark only half aware of the problem it seeks to address. The real embarrassment for the Church--though they might not see it thus--is that IN THE VERY ACT OF asserting homosexuality to be \"no worse than\" other sins, they essentially flag it as being just that, branding homosexuality as uniquely worthy of repudiation in the membership oath.\n \n The problem in this resolution is an instantiation of a difficulty I perceive widely extant in certain Southern churches, and some churches which (like EMC) spawned in the South: The Church hasn't a long or pervasive intellectual or academic tradition. Methodism does, to a considerable extent, and United Methodism does. But Evan Meth, calved off essentially in reaction to perceived UMC 'liberalism,' seems to live out its theologic life less than it might in the construction of theory and method, and more than perhaps it should in that continuing (now decades-old, and decades-tired) response to liberalism. In my home EMC church, 'liberal' is a dirty word. Yet few I've asked can define it. Many do, however, tend to associate 'liberalism' with academic and intellectual pursuit. A few openly eschew 'book-learnin', and one elder of my acquaintance is willing, astonishingly, to assert that Christians should NOT be encouraged to read.\n \n One disservice churches do when they live out this kind of flavour is to repel persons who do have academic training, who are well read, and who--to return to the subject of this ill-worded resolution--live with a robust sense of the power of language.\n \n Thanks, Kronus, for helping me think through this. Bless you.\n \n B\n \n \n \n \nI can come up with an answer to this that at least makes some sense. I don't know if this is what they were thinking, of course.\n \n Based on your post I get the impression that you believe (and if so, I agree) that being gay is something that you simply are, something that's inherent to you.
