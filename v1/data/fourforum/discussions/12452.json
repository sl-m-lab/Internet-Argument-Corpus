I was raised as a Mormon, the religion teaches you to reach for perfection. Not the best, not more, but perfection. The reason I emphasis this is because some people take it, literally. They just try to reach beyond what is attainable and end up in failure because their belief of perfection trampled not only on their humanity, but their love ones as well. I understand some people will not take it literally and that's fine, but I think one should take caution on how one uses it. \n \n Here's another curveball for you guys.

   "Perfection is unattainable because of our human nature to be inquisitive.\n \n Knowledge can be narrowly (and crudely) defined as the attempt to catalog every single bit of an object's characteristics. As we catalog the characteristics, we actually begin to stray from what the object is and only define parts of the object. The perfect way to define an apple is that it is an apple. You will never be able to describe it more perfectly than that, but the human race would never be satisfied with that definition. We can come close to perfection as we can come close to describing just nearly what an apple is by describing all of it's characteristics, but when you realize that all you have truly said is that an apple is an apple in so many words, you will realize you knew what it was all along.\n \n The greatest part about science is that we stare the answers to the universe's mysteries dead in the face every day of our lives.
