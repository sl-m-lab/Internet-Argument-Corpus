Neither should apply to a scientific theory, which is accepted or not to an extent dependent on the supporting evidence.\n \n It makes no sense to say you do or don't 'believe in' general relativity or quantum mechanics: if you are able, you weigh up the evidence for those theories' claims and come to a judgement of their worth based on that.

They may do this quite deliberately in order to confuse the basis of scientific knowledge with the \"metaphysical\" sources of their belief system; and, as you imply, this could result in a fatuous attempt to discredit or to misrepresent science.\n \n Others simply don't understand that the (falsifiable) hypotheses generated from a scientific theory are not matters of conjecture, personal opinion, etc., but consist of syntheses of data which have been verified through empirical observation.",
