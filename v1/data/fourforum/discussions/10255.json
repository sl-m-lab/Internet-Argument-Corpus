   "http://www.creators.com/opinion/dennis-prager.html\n \n \n -By Dennis Prager\n \n \nOne of the two major political parties of the United States has linked all its electoral hopes on domestic pathologies, economic downturns and foreign failure.\n \n It is actually difficult to name any positive development for America that would benefit the Democratic Party's chances in a national election.\n \n Name almost any subject, and this unhealthy pattern can be discerned.\n \n If African Americans come to believe that America is a land of opportunity in which racism has been largely conquered, it would be catastrophic for the Democrats. The day that most black Americans see America in positive terms will be the day Democrats lose any hope of winning a national election. Whatever one believes about the extent of racism in America, one cannot deny that the Democrats need black Americans to feel victimized by racism. Contented black Americans spell disaster for the Democratic Party.\n \n If women marry, it is bad for the Democratic Party. Single women are an essential component of any Democratic victory. Unmarried women voted for Kerry by a 25-point margin (62 percent to 37 percent), while married women voted for President Bush by an 11-point margin (55 percent to 44 percent). According to a pro-Democrat website, The Emerging Democratic Majority, \"the 25-point margin Kerry posted among unmarried women represented one of the high water marks for the Senator among all demographic groups.\"\n \n After women marry, they are more likely to abandon leftist views and to vote Republican. And if they then have children, they will vote Republican in even more lopsided numbers. The bottom line is that when Americans marry, it is bad for the Democratic Party; when they marry and make families, it is disastrous for the party.\n \n If immigrants assimilate, it is not good for Democrats. The Democratic Party has invested in Latino separatism. The more that Hispanic immigrants come to feel fully American, the less likely they are to vote Democrat. The liberal notion of multiculturalism helps Democrats, while adoption of the American ideal of e pluribus unum (out of many, one) helps Republicans. That is one reason Democrats support bilingual education - it hurts Hispanic children, but it keeps them from full assimilation - and oppose making English America's official language.\n \n Concerning the economy, the same rule applies. The better Americans feel they are doing, the worse it is for Democrats. \n By almost every economic measure (the current housing crisis excepted), Americans are doing well. The unemployment rate has been at historically low levels and inflation has been held in check, something that rarely accompanies low unemployment rates. Nevertheless, Democrats regularly appeal to class resentment, knowing that sowing seeds of economic resentment increases their chances of being elected.\n \n The most obvious area in which this rule currently applies is the war in Iraq. The Democrats have put themselves in the position of needing failure in Iraq in order to win the next election. And again, perceptions matter more than reality. Even if America is doing better in the war, what matters most for the Democrats are Americans' perceptions of the war. The worse the stories from Iraq, the better for Democrats.\n \n That helps to explain why the mainstream media, who ache for a Democratic victory, feature stories of wounded American soldiers, grieving families of killed soldiers and atrocity stories - such as the apparently fictitious story printed in the New Republic. But they almost never feature stories about military heroism and altruism. Americans read and watch far more stories about soldiers who commit atrocities than about soldiers who commit heroic actions and who show love to Iraqi civilians.\n \n The list is almost endless. Thus, when pro-American foreign leaders - such as Nicolas Sarkozy in France - are elected, even that is not good for the Democrats. The more the Democrats can show that America is hated, the more the Democrats can argue that we need them in order to be loved abroad.\n \n Undoubtedly, some Democrats might respond that the same thesis could be written if a Democrat were in the White House and the Republicans were out of power. But that is not at all the case. First, there is no equivalent list of bad things happening to America that benefits Republicans. Second, everything written here about the Democrats - except about the Iraq War, which was not taking place then - could have been written when Democrat Bill Clinton was president.\n \n I am not saying that in their hearts all Democrats want black America to regard America as a racist society, or want Hispanics to remain unassimilated, or Americans to feel economically discontented, or fewer families to be formed, or America to lose in Iraq, or foreign nations to hate us.\n \n But what most Democrats want in their hearts is not the issue. The issue is that if Democrats want to win, they can do so only if bad things happen to America.\n \n Dennis Prager hosts a nationally syndicated radio talk show based in Los Angeles. He is the author of four books, most recently \"Happiness Is a Serious Problem\" (HarperCollins). His Website is www.pragerradio.com.\n\n \n COPYRIGHT 2007 CREATORS SYNDICATE, INC.",

   "From the idiot Prager bot:\n \n \nIf African Americans come to believe that America is a land of opportunity in which racism has been largely conquered, it would be catastrophic for the Democrats. The day that most black Americans see America in positive terms will be the day Democrats lose any hope of winning a national election. Whatever one believes about the extent of racism in America, one cannot deny that the Democrats need black Americans to feel victimized by racism. Contented black Americans spell disaster for the Democratic Party.\nAlthough a lot of progress has been made, there is still a hell of a lot of racism in this country and African Americans would be damned fools not to recognize that cruel fact of life.\n \n \nIf women marry, it is bad for the Democratic Party. Single women are an essential component of any Democratic victory. Unmarried women voted for Kerry by a 25-point margin (62 percent to 37 percent), while married women voted for President Bush by an 11-point margin (55 percent to 44 percent). According to a pro-Democrat website, The Emerging Democratic Majority, \"the 25-point margin Kerry posted among unmarried women represented one of the high water marks for the Senator among all demographic groups.\"\nI dunno. I think Democratic women like to get married as much, if not more so, than Republican women. And, when Democratic women marry they tend to stay married, to the same man, as well--because they are not routinely traded off for the trendier \"trophy wives\" that Republican men like to collect. Gingrich, Guiliani, Dick Armey, Dole, Fred Thompson, etc.\n \n \nAfter women marry, they are more likely to abandon leftist views and to vote Republican. And if they then have children, they will vote Republican in even more lopsided numbers. The bottom line is that when Americans marry, it is bad for the Democratic Party; when they marry and make families, it is disastrous for the party.\nEven after their husbands abandon them for a nice, new trophy wife--and fail to make support payments ala Newt Gingrich?\n \n \nIf immigrants assimilate, it is not good for Democrats. The Democratic Party has invested in Latino separatism. The more that Hispanic immigrants come to feel fully American, the less likely they are to vote Democrat. The liberal notion of multiculturalism helps Democrats, while adoption of the American ideal of e pluribus unum (out of many, one) helps Republicans. That is one reason Democrats support bilingual education - it hurts Hispanic children, but it keeps them from full assimilation - and oppose making English America's official language.\nI dunno. I think as soon as Latinos get it figured out, they'll go Democratic.\n \n \nConcerning the economy, the same rule applies. The better Americans feel they are doing, the worse it is for Democrats.\nUm, when are we going to recover economically from the Bush economics? I see that they're tinkering with prime lending rates to give the stock market a boost and stop its tumbling. I certainly hope it works.\n \n \nBy almost every economic measure (the current housing crisis excepted), Americans are doing well. The unemployment rate has been at historically low levels and inflation has been held in check, something that rarely accompanies low unemployment rates. Nevertheless, Democrats regularly appeal to class resentment, knowing that sowing seeds of economic resentment increases their chances of being elected.\nSo, what kind of jobs have been created since Bush became president? All the good jobs have been outsourced and a lot of Americans are forced to work two or three jobs, both husbands and wives, in order to keep their families afloat. That's your typical \"Republican Family Values.\" Defecate on struggling American families.\n \n \nThe most obvious area in which this rule currently applies is the war in Iraq. The Democrats have put themselves in the position of needing failure in Iraq in order to win the next election. And again, perceptions matter more than reality. Even if America is doing better in the war, what matters most for the Democrats are Americans' perceptions of the war. The worse the stories from Iraq, the better for Democrats.\nWhat is \"success in Iraq\"? Why can't a decent water supply and reliable electricity be restored to Iraq? That should have been the first order of business in order to bring about a successful result for Iraq. Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld refused to make sure that that was going to be done. They wanted Iraq to be a failure so we can stay there forever.\n \n \nThat helps to explain why the mainstream media, who ache for a Democratic victory, feature stories of wounded American soldiers, grieving families of killed soldiers and atrocity stories - such as the apparently fictitious story printed in the New Republic. But they almost never feature stories about military heroism and altruism. Americans read and watch far more stories about soldiers who commit atrocities than about soldiers who commit heroic actions and who show love to Iraqi civilians.\nThe so-called \"mainstream media\" was a major cheerleader for Bush to invade and occupy Iraq. The supposedly leftist New York Times gave plenty of print space to a Mr. Chalabi who was the primary architect of the argument for invading Iraq--and it turns out that Chalabi lied at every turn. \n \n And, what about the WMDs? What about that lie?\n \n What about the connection between Iraq and Al-Qaeda? What about that lie?\n \n And, what about the connection between Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein? What about that lie?\n \n There is a far closer connection between George Walker Bush and Osama bin Laden than there ever was between bin Laden and Hussein.\n \n \nThe list is almost endless. Thus, when pro-American foreign leaders - such as Nicolas Sarkozy in France - are elected, even that is not good for the Democrats. The more the Democrats can show that America is hated, the more the Democrats can argue that we need them in order to be loved abroad.\nI dunno. Sarkozy's wife snubbed the Bushes.\n \n \nUndoubtedly, some Democrats might respond that the same thesis could be written if a Democrat were in the White House and the Republicans were out of power. But that is not at all the case. First, there is no equivalent list of bad things happening to America that benefits Republicans. Second, everything written here about the Democrats - except about the Iraq War, which was not taking place then - could have been written when Democrat Bill Clinton was president.\nWar profiteering. Contracts let without competition and oversight. Boondoggles stealing billions of American tax dollars, all to the benefit of Republicans.",

Socialism/Liberalism, by it's very nature, breeds dependence on big government and all of the entitlements therein.

The simple answer to that question is \"Too large,\" but trying to nail down an exact figure can actually be difficult according to this story in USA Today:\n The federal government keeps two sets of books. \n The set the government promotes to the public has a healthier bottom line: a $318 billion deficit in 2005.\n The set the government doesn't talk about is the audited financial statement produced by the government's accountants following standard accounting rules. It reports a more ominous financial picture: a $760 billion deficit for 2005. If Social Security and Medicare were included - as the board that sets accounting rules is considering - the federal deficit would have been $3.5 trillion.\n Congress has written its own accounting rules - which would be illegal for a corporation to use because they ignore important costs such as the growing expense of retirement benefits for civil servants and military personnel.\n Last year, the audited statement produced by the accountants said the government ran a deficit equal to $6,700 for every American household. The number given to the public put the deficit at $2,800 per household. \n This is absolutely unacceptable and cannot continue, but it is also a bipartisan problem so I don't want to hear that the Democrats are going to fix it if they gain control of Congress. This problem was created while they were in power and the GOP has continued the practice:\n The Clinton administration reported a surplus of $559 billion in its final four budget years. The audited numbers showed a deficit of $484 billion. \n It is up to us, the American people, to pressure our government in to accurately reporting its financial position.\n \n \n \n \n http://www.worldfreeinternet.net/news/nws174.htm\n \n (WFI EDITOR: Anyone with half a wit would realize that the only way an institution as mammoth as the Federal Government could go from deficits to surpluses, was by employing dubious accounting methods. Along with the statistics that support the PR hype that we are in the middle of a \"boom\" because some people have made profits from the stock market bubble, it is conventional wisdom that the \"wise\" men running the country have inflation under control too. The reality that there is no boom, that there is no surplus, is as lost as the truth about Bill Clinton's honesty. His most recent travesty, the Cross Country Poverty Tour, is another example of his superficial means of addressing significant social issues. The president is a photo-op waiting to happen.)",

How can a system that bankrupts people who suffer from chronic illness be a good thing?\n\n \n After much research and hearing from a lot of people living under various different types of healthcare systems, I have changed my mind on this particular issue (not that it matters). At one time I was rabidly against the idea of socialized or nationalized medicine. \n \n It is difficult tto find anything unbiased about nationalized health care. Everybody is pushing their own agenda and it seems to be difficult to draw the line between propoganda and reality. There are a few things that seem to be recurrent themes in the british and canadian systems (that do not necessarily exist in other socialized health systems):\n \n 1. Waiting lists\n 2. Programs are underfunded.\n \n At one time those were my primary concerns, and my argument against nationalized madicine was based on those. The reality seems to be a little different now that I have a few more facts and have had the opportunity to talk to some different people living under various systems.\n \n Waiting lists do not seem to bother anybody . I have even spoken to some people who are on waiting lists, and they don't seem to mind for the most part. The waiting list thing is related to #2 above, which is that it seems the programs are underfunded. \n \n IMO what this boils down to is a single question...is the underfunding a structural deficiency in the program itself, or is it a political situation that could be corrected without significant modification to the program??\n \n The second seems to be correct. If the british and canadians spent as much per capita on health care as we do in the US, they could have carried out literally every program upgrade ever proposed in their programs. The Swedes I have spoken to say \"We have a waiting list???? From what I can find, contrary to the claims in jims link, the waiting list is not a prominent part of the swedish health care system. \n \n Then I started thinking about whether a waitign list was that big a deal or not. According to the census bureau, roughly 45.8 million americans don't have any insurance. They don't even get to be on a waiting list. Roughly another 50 million americans are on worthless insurance plans. They never get their surgery because their insurance won't cover it.\n \n It seems like in order for Americans to point to waiting lists as a problem, we first need to clear the 100 million americans who don't get any health care at all. When we have children in our country who (literally) die from things that could have been cured with a $6 bottle of pennicilin, I just don't see where the fact that there is a waiting list for plastic surgery in finland really comes into the equation.\n \n Ultimatly it does not matter. We could fix the US system with a few regulatory changes. We could move to nationalized health care. Eitehr option would be better than what we have now, but we will not see either option exercised because there is too much money there. It would take a MAJOR movement by the American people to get changes made, and putting up a cohesive front on something like that is not real likely. A large percentage of Americans are not bright enough to even understand the issue. They have been programmed with terms like \"free market\" and \"market competion\" that they fail to uderstand that there IS no such thing as a free market in health care, and that what we have now is CERTAINLY not a free market. \n \n The thing is, we could pass a pricing uniformity law for the health care industry that would solve a huge majority of our problems. Currently in the US, you go to the doctors office for a check up, lab work, whatever, and the prices you see on your bill are nowhere near what your insurance company actually pays. For example, my wife went for a post operative checkup after having our last kid. It involved a checkup, some lab work, and an X-ray. The bill came to just over $900. We paid a $20 copay, and the insurance ended up paying $91.44, so the total payment on the account was $111.44. The doctors office KNEW what the insurance would pay when they performed the work, but they had agreed to the insurance companies pricing structure when they signed onto that HMO. They also agreed that the bill to the patients would include the full amount so the patient looks and goes \"Man, I am sure glad I have insurance. It saved me a fortune\". \n \n If you are uninsured, you pay the $900. Pricing uniformity laws would make is so doctors offices, hospitals, etc... would have to have published prices and would have to charge everybody the same price. No more using the doctors bill as an advertisment for health insurance companies. The $111.44 visit would cost the same whether you were insured or not. That one, single move would make insuarence a LOT more affordable and would also allow our current governement programs (that are not based on the price breaks) to service more people.\n \n If you were to extend that pricing uniformity to insurance plans as well, insurance would become a LOT more affordable for a lot more people. Right now the most expensive plans are those for single purchasers (buying insurance for yourself or your family on your own) while large purchasers get HUGE discounts (up to 75%).\n \n The insurance industry says this is because in taking those big groups, they have spread the risk among multiple purchasers. The problem is that what they are describing is how the ENTIRE insurance industry works. Nobody pares it down into different risk groups within the main pool. Even insurance industry insiders who have spoken publicly have admitted that there is no further risk assesment done on corporate policies, it is just a matter of putting forth the best possible price in order to get the account. If an insurance company can provide a policy for the entire family of 4 of a guy who works at boeing for $325 a month, they can provide it to anybody at that price. The risk assesment is the same since it is spread over the ENTIRE pool of policyholders. Pricing uniformity would require that insurance companies offer the same plans to for the same money regardless of the purchaser (though exception would probably be made for pre-existing conditions, etc...).\n \n Those 2 moves would be fair and would help alleviate the health care problems in the US and essentially all you are talking about doing is removing the health care industries exemption from price gougin and price fixing laws.",

   "Recently US are meddling too much into Greek home politics. More and more Greek politicians reverse their point of view to pro-American one. And American 'independent' companies are trying to penetrate into Greek agriculture, armaments export and tourist business.\n I think that its silly letting Yankees so deep into our home affairs. For I can't see they support Greece much in important questions of foreign politics. In particular in case of friction between Greece and Turkey and Cypress problem US are inclined to take Turk side. By the way Greece is NATO member as well as Turkey. So we have right to count on our allies' support either. And Cypress problem has been relevant since 1954. And now US is about to recognize Turk North Cypress Republic. In this manner Greeks soon may lose large part of their sovereignty. And Washington would impose them its will. It has already undertaken first steps to it bribing and intimidating Greek politics.\n So soon Greece would become US puppet in Europe. And that would be another fifth column in EU. But why do other EU members keep aside? By the way Turkey isn't EU member yet and I hope it won't ever be. So why shouldn't support fellow country in its resistance of becoming US satellite?",
