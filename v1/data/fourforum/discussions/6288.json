   "I live in the Bible belt: Creationists galore ... stores with Biblical scripture on their outside signs ... \"Keep the Ten Commandments\" bumper stickers common ... and so on. \n \n A couple weeks ago I put the following on my car:\n \n 1) a Darwin emblem (I have an Evolve Fish emblem coming to partner it up with)\n \n 2) a \"What schools need is a moment of SCIENCE\" bumper sticker\n \n 3) a \"Freedom is the distance between church and state\" bumper sticker.\n \n No vandalism yet, but I was actually told by some of my friends at work that I had better watch out: kind of the old \"people 'round these parts don't take kindly to your type\" thing.\n \n \n I also tacked an atheist pamphlet on the company's bulletin board in the break room (I first checked to see if there were already religious items posted and there were. If there weren't, I would not have felt justified in posting atheist material \"out of the blue\", but with religious propaganda already on the board I was just presenting the other side of the story). It got some attention but was gone by the end of the first day (I don't know if someone interested in joining the atheist organization took it, or if a religious zealot felt s/he had a duty to defend God by tearing down and discarding a pamphlet showing the other side).\n \n \n Then last week, I read a letter to the editor in our local Sunday paper that I just had to respond to. First, the letter to the editor printed in the 08/21/05 Sunday edition of the Dothan Eagle that triggered my 'response'.\n \n \n \nI am not amazed at the fallout caused by President Bush's comments about Intelligent Design.\n \n Darwin evolution nuts - I mean intellectual scientists - contend Intelligent Design is untested and untestable by scientific research. Apparently, evolution is not scientifically testable because they keep trying, to no avail.\n \n The intellectuals would have us believe in the Big Bang theory. They cannot tell you where the bang came from and they cannot explain the origin of the one-cell amoeba that evolved into humans. If, in fact, we came from apes, why do we still have apes?\n \n I assume, \"scientifically\", if you are smarter than God, you would prefer evolution as the means for your arrival on earth. My answer is to that is, \"You may have come from an ape, but I didn't.\"\n \n If those who believe in evolution are correct, when this world is over, it won't make any difference to anyone. If, in fact, the Christians are right and God created the world and hell, it will make a huge different to those who do not believe.\n \n Gerald L. Hicks\n Dothan\n\n \n \n And finally, my own letter to the editor, which was printed in this week's Sunday paper (08/28/2005).\n \n \nWith so many people still believing that God created man only six to ten thousand years ago, and labeling as 'nuts' those who accept evolution, much of this area must still be living in the dark ages. \n \n No real scientist still believes the Earth, or the life on it, is only a few thousand years old. In fact, most religions, including most forms of Christianity, also reject a young earth. It is only religious fundamentalists who still cling to the outdated, Biblical timeline. As far as reality goes, multiple isochron datings - each using internal checks - of the oldest exposed rocks on Earth produced consistent ages of 3.7 billion years, conclusively showing that our planet is billions, not thousands, of years old.\n \n Evolution is so overwhelming supported that biologists consider rejection of evolution tantamount to rejection of reason. The evidences from comparative anatomy (homologous structures), genetics (sequence similarities), and embryology (same genes regulating development) group species into a consistent nested hierarchy. Also supporting common descent is the fact that the chronology of the fossil record is in evolutionary order; for example, we find the first appearance of fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, primates, and humans, in that order. And despite what Creationists claim, there are many transitional fossils, such as those showing the evolution of the mammalian ossicles from some of the reptilian jaw bones. \"Living intermediates\" in the origin of multicellularity can be found in representatives of the Volvocaceans. Finally, a speciation event, involving hemp nettles, that occurred in nature was duplicated in the lab: here we know the exact chromosomal events that led to the production of a new species ... in the wild. \n \n Isn't it about time the citizens of this area leave outdated modes of thought behind, and catch up with the rest of the world?\n \n Rick Pierson\n Dothan\n \n\n \n With my name printed in the paper, I wonder if I'll experience any \"rebuking\" from the local religious majority.",

   "Well, I've written another letter to the editor. Kind of late in the week, so I don't know if it will get printed because of time constraints ... or maybe because of its content. This time I've stepped it up a notch or two. No way for me to have another friendly little chat with my dentist if this get's printed and he reads it.\n \n \n\n This country does not need to pray for New Orleans, it needs to do something that will actually help.\n \n If Christians really believe what Jesus said about the power of prayer (Matthew 21:21-22, Mark 11:22-24) then they should just sit back and do nothing but pray; pray that Jesus miraculously make the flood waters disappear, whip up vast supplies of food, heal the sick, and bring law and order back to the area. But Christians will not rely on prayer alone: why not? Do they believe Jesus lied? Do they believe Jesus is incapable? Do they believe Jesus absolutely despises New Orleans, and wants the people there to suffer? (If the latter, then Christians would be going against God's will by helping the city). What is clear is that they do not believe that even just one single Christian of the millions who would be praying would have his/her prayer answered. That is why Christians, like the rest of the nation, rely upon honest-to-goodness, flesh-and-bones people to go out there and physically handle the problems. It is humans - and only we humans - who actually help. No supernatural being needed, no supernatural assistance evident.\n \n Nothing fails like prayer. Everyone knows this, but many try to deny it. We need to place our faith in the goodness of our fellow humans, not in some mythical spirit our superstitious ancestors conjured up.\n \n And shame on President Bush for seeing yet another national disaster as a great opportunity to preach to our nation about God and prayer. \n \n Speaking of which, we need to realize that when our President speaks of God, he is referring specifically to Christianity's God. For him to in any way lend credence to, or validate the existence of, any other God is forbidden by his own monotheistic religion, and its jealous God.\n \n",

   "Dam, I've got another one! This one is a personal letter though.\n \n A local Jehovah's Witness has seen fit to send me a personally written letter, along with a short religous tract and a list of 14 questions they think I might want to know the answers to. I've written a response that I will send back to them....\n \n \nYou recently sent me a letter in which you listed 14 questions you seemed interested in knowing the answers to. I've spent a few minutes to do just that ... you're welcome.\n \n \n \n \n \n Below is a sample of questions you might like answered?\n \n \n \n 1. Why do we grow old and die?\n \n A few reasons we grow old and eventually die are (1) progressive shortening of (chromosomal) telomeres during successive somatic cell divisions, (2) accumulated cellular damage from free radicals generated by oxidative phosphorylation, and (3) accumulated genetic damage in somatic cells generated by spontaneous mutations.\n \n \n \n 2. What is the condition of the dead?\n \n Decayed. \n \n \n \n 3. Are there sound reasons for believing in God?\n \n Nope, not a single one. But there are several good reasons to not believe in God.\n \n \n \n 4. Does God really care what happens to us humans?\n \n God doesn't exist, but for the sake of argument, let's look to the Bible - Genesis in particular. Well, it shows that sometimes God despises humans. As one example, there's the time God destroyed all people on the face of the Earth, except for Noah and his family, in a great flood. And then there's the time God killed all of the people in Sodom and Gomorrah ... except of course for (1) Lot - who offered his two virgin daughters to a crowd of horny men to be gang raped, and (2) his two daughters themselves - who took turns getting their father drunk and having sex with him, with both ending up pregnant from their incestuous rapes.\n \n \n \n 5. Is God a real person?\n \n Nope. God exists only in some people's mind.\n \n \n \n 6. Do all good people go to heaven?\n \n Gee, I don't know, but I've heard that all good dogs go to heaven.\n \n \n \n 7. Must a person go to heaven to have a truly happy life?\n \n Well, since there's no such thing as heaven, I sure hope not: otherwise, no one would ever live a truly happy life.\n \n \n \n 8. Why is it important to know and use God's personal name?\n \n Oh, I use God's names all the time. I say \"Jesus Christ!\" and \"God dam it!\" at least a few times each week. \n \n Oh, or did you mean God's personal name, Jealous? That is what Exodus 34:14 tells us God's name is: Jealous.\n \n \n \n 9. Is Jesus Christ actually God?\n \n No, since Jesus was not Christ: he was just a person. Jesus Christ is a fictional character, as is God. And asking if one fictional character is the same as another has no real value. I mean, what do we learn about the real world by asking if Santa Clause is actually the Easter Bunny?\n \n \n \n 10. What will God's kingdom accomplish?\n \n Nothing, since there's no such thing. But strong belief in God's kingdom has driven many people to kill others, as the Christians did while they were out spreading the \"Good News\" across the globe. \n \n Christian invader: \"Hey there native, do you know the good news? Here's what I believe. We're all sinners, and Jesus died on the cross to redeem us. You see ...\"\n \n Native: \"Sorry, I have different beliefs.\"\n \n Christian invader: \"Oh, okay, then I must kill you.\"\n \n \n \n 11. What is the purpose of human life?\n \n The same as the purpose of all other life: to reproduce ... to perpetuate the species. Anything on top of that is essentially \"icing on the cake\". That's not to say that life has no other purpose whatsoever. Humanism teaches us, among other things, that we should each value other people and try to bring happiness into their lives as we strive to work together towards the greater good of humanity: those are great purposes too.\n \n \n \n 12. What can help to improve a marriage?\n \n Hmmm, what about keeping all extramarital affairs hidden from your spouse.\n \n \n \n 13. Are all religions acceptable to God?\n \n No, just those that kill animals and burn them: Lord knows God sure does love the sight of blood being spilled and the smell of burning animal flesh. \n \n \n \n 14. How can a person know which religion is right?\n \n A person can't possibly know which one is right, because they're all wrong.\n \n \n \n 15. How powerful a figure is Satan in today's world?\n \n Well, the Bible tells us that Satan is clearly strong enough to manipulate God: we see Satan doing just this in the book of Job. \n \n \n \n 16. Why does God permit suffering?\n \n I don't know, because He's a bastard? I mean, what else would one expect from a God who loves the sight of blood and the smell of burning flesh?\n \n \n \n 17. Why is there so much wickedness?\n \n According to the Bible, because God created evil. Had He not done so, there would be no wickedness.\n \n \n \n 18. Who rules this world - God or Satan?\n \n Neither. The laws of nature rule this world.\n \n",

   "Well, the s**t has hit the fan!\n \n I may have to forfeit my debate against marc9000 for lack of time. I have to choose between debating here and defending myself in my hometown! Sorry, but the latter takes precedence.\n \n I did not know that so many people had responded to my letter to the editor about evolution. Someone told me I had started some s**t and that several responsed had been printed. I grabbed the last week's worth of papers and found several (and one of them mentions reply for a date that I didn't get the paper for, so I know there is at least one more).\n \n Here's the run down so far.\n \n \n First, the letter to the editor printed in the 08/21/05 Sunday edition of the Dothan Eagle that triggered my 'response'.\n \n \nI am not amazed at the fallout caused by President Bush's comments about Intelligent Design.\n \n Darwin evolution nuts - I mean intellectual scientists - contend Intelligent Design is untested and untestable by scientific research. Apparently, evolution is not scientifically testable because they keep trying, to no avail.\n \n The intellectuals would have us believe in the Big Bang theory. They cannot tell you where the bang came from and they cannot explain the origin of the one-cell amoeba that evolved into humans. If, in fact, we came from apes, why do we still have apes?\n \n I assume, \"scientifically\", if you are smarter than God, you would prefer evolution as the means for your arrival on earth. My answer to that is, \"You may have come from an ape, but I didn't.\"\n \n If those who believe in evolution are correct, when this world is over, it won't make any difference to anyone. If, in fact, the Christians are right and God created the world and hell, it will make a huge different to those who do not believe.\n \n Gerald L. Hicks\n Dothan\n \n\n \n \n And my own letter to the editor, which was printed in this week's Sunday paper (08/28/2005).\n \n \nWith so many people still believing that God created man only six to ten thousand years ago, and labeling as 'nuts' those who accept evolution, much of this area must still be living in the Dark Ages. \n \n No real scientist still believes the Earth, or the life on it, is only a few thousand years old. In fact, most religions, including most forms of Christianity, also reject a young earth. It is only religious fundamentalists who still cling to the outdated, Biblical timeline. As far as reality goes, multiple isochron datings - each using internal checks - of the oldest exposed rocks on Earth produced consistent ages of 3.7 billion years, conclusively showing that our planet is billions, not thousands, of years old.\n \n Evolution is so overwhelming supported that biologists consider rejection of evolution tantamount to rejection of reason. The evidences from comparative anatomy (homologous structures), genetics (sequence similarities), and embryology (same genes regulating development) group species into a consistent nested hierarchy. Also supporting common descent is the fact that the chronology of the fossil record is in evolutionary order; for example, we find the first appearance of fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, primates, and humans, in that order. And despite what Creationists claim, there are many transitional fossils, such as those showing the evolution of the mammalian ossicles from some of the reptilian jaw bones. \n \n \"Living intermediates\" in the origin of multicellularity can be found in representatives of the Volvocaceans. Finally, a speciation event, involving hemp nettles, that occurred in nature was duplicated in the lab: here we know the exact chromosomal events that led to the production of a new species, in the wild. \n \n Isn't it about time the residents of this area leave outdated modes of thought behind, and catch up with the rest of the world?\n \n Rick Pierson\n Dothan\n \n\n \n \n \n That's where I had left off. Since then the following have been published.\n \n From the 09/11/2005 Sunday paper (Dothan Eagle)\n \n \nI read the familiar position in an Aug. 28 letter by Rick Pierson. I say familiar, although I have never read any of Pierson's writings and I do not know him, though I would venture that he is educated, successful and genuine.\n \n In his opinion, he pointed that it is just about time we toss the thin, threadbare dogma of creation into the fire and don the fabulous new colors of Science (I think the ACLU still allows capitalization of words of deity).\n \n I am certain Mr. Pierson supposed he is right, and in good conscience must go on record. His conclusions are based on the most popular science.\n \n But is science alone enough? From my vantage point, both in life and as an engineer (and thus something of a scientist) I am persuaded that God is.\n \n C. S. Lewis remarked that a genuine submission to the Christian God never disappointed. My experience concurs. I am also persuaded that God created. That persuasion springs from reason must be obvious.\n \n Now, Mr. Pierson urges that we move out of the \"Dark Ages.\" That is a good aim. Unfortunately, evolution at its core always says that \"God isn't\" or at least that anything not appealing to the pentasensual isn't. And that old theology has been with us since time began, before the \"Dark Ages.\"\n \n Thos colors aren't so new.\n \n Beyond all that, I still think the science is far from complete. What came first, life or DNA? How did that first animal appear with the means and instinct to forage, digest, metabolize, excrete, respire and reproduce? And this one still intrigues me: Why must evolutionists (in an accidental science) refer to evolution's truly fantastic biological mysteries as being \"produced\" or \"designed\" (an exact science)?\n \n Lance Beasley\n Dothan\n \n\n \n \n \n On (or about) 09/15/2005, two separate responses were published\n \n \nIn reference to Rick Pierson's Aug. 28 letter on evolution, this area is not the only area that believes in the intelligent design by a Supreme Being.\n \n Questions that can't be answered by evolution are:\n \n - How did the heavens and the earth get here?\n \n - How is it that the sun is the exact distance from the earth that it must be?\n \n - How does the Earth tilt north and south to provide seasonal changes?\n \n - How is it that nature is in perfect harmony?\n \n - How is it that prophecies in the Bible have come true as stated?\n \n The concept of evolution is in reality contrary to the word of God. The mathematical possibility of a Christian going to Heaven is 100 percent. The possibility of a non-Christian going to Heaven is zero percent in accordance with the word of God.\n \n If death is the finality of mankind according to the evolutionists, then the Christian would not have lost anything. But if not - and there really is a Heaven and Hell and eternal life with the Creator forever and eternal torment for the non-Christian - then the Christian would gain everything and the non-Christian would lose everything.\n \n Choose the road you want to travel.\n \n Ray Connor\n Daleville\n \n\n \n and\n \n \nWith regard to Rick Pierson's Aug. 28 letter about the theory of evolution, I think it is about time for evolutionists to admit that this theory on evolution can no more be proven than the Bible can prove God as Creator.\n \n That is correct; the Bible cannot and was not intended to prove that there is a holy, all-powerful, all-knowing God, the same God I firmly believe is Creator, not only of man and beast, but of the entire universe.\n \n You ask with a somewhat puzzled look how it is that one can believe that God is Creator of all things, living and not, if the foundation of your belief, the Bible, cannot be proven.\n \n The answer is faith. We all worship something. In my case, I worship the Creator and not the created. Evolutionists place faith in a theory and it is a theory that cannot be proven. They have great faith and deep devotion to winning everyone to the idea that this theory is correct and that makes it their religion - the very same thing Christians are scorned for having.\n \n No, I can't take God's word and prove He is God or that He created the universe because the message of God's word is foolishness to those who are perishing. God's word was never intended to prove Him as Creator, it was recorded simply to say He is.\n \n If the theory of evolution and creationism cannot be currently proven, don't you think they deserve equal time in our classrooms?\n \n Ray Robinson\n Dothan\n \n\n \n \n And in today's (09/16/2005) Dothan Eagle:\n \n \nI cannot say Rick Pierson's Aug. 28 letter is dumb because he has an extremely large vocabulary, such as multicellularity and Volvocaceans. There were a few things that caught my unintelligent eye, however. He refers to \"the oldest exposed rocks\" being 3.7 billion years old How old are the oldest unexposed rocks and did they all arrive at different times?\n \n I am inclined to reject reason when a bunch of marijuana-smoking scientists get together to perform a speciation event to grow a new strand of marijuana - i.e., hemp - nettles. How this was duplicated in the laboratory and lead the production of a new species in the wild is quite a feat. Either it was in the laboratory or it was in the wild.\n \n I am amazed at the number of people in this area who believe that everyone here is dumb and outdated.\n \n My question to all those who believe like that is, \"Why are you still here? Can you read a road map?\" If not, I can and will be glad to show you how to exit this area so you can arrive at a place where people are a little bit more intelligent.\n \n I though I had observed abject ignorance in my 70 years, but Vic Powell's Sept. 2 letter has topped everything to this date. He said evolution has nothing to do with how our species began, merely how it came to be in its present form.\n \n I know man didn't come from apes; they came from fish, as Rick Pierson pointed out.\n \n If science and religion are not at odds with one another and science and religion are in harmony as Vic said, then God created the world and then evolution began. That sounds better than we came from a fish to amphibians to reptiles to mammals to primate to humans, as Rick stated.\n \n The main reason people refuse to believe in Intelligent Design is the fact that they would have to change their ungodly lifestyles. They want to live like they want to live with no supreme being to answer to. They might not answer today, but when this life on earth is over, we will all answer to Almighty God.\n \n My prayer is that all men will come to know the Savior Jesus Christ before it is too late.\n \n Gerald L. Hicks\n Dothan\n \n\n \n I've got some business I have to take care of!\n \n \n I also have to track down any other replies, such as the 09/02 one mentioned in one of the new replies.",

   "Got one reply off!\n \n On (or about) 09/15/2005, this response was published.\n \n \nIn reference to Rick Pierson's Aug. 28 letter on evolution, this area is not the only area that believes in the intelligent design by a Supreme Being.\n \n Questions that can't be answered by evolution are:\n \n - How did the heavens and the earth get here?\n \n - How is it that the sun is the exact distance from the earth that it must be?\n \n - How does the Earth tilt north and south to provide seasonal changes?\n \n - How is it that nature is in perfect harmony?\n \n - How is it that prophecies in the Bible have come true as stated?\n \n The concept of evolution is in reality contrary to the word of God.

But if not - and there really is a Heaven and Hell and eternal life with the Creator forever and eternal torment for the non-Christian - then the Christian would gain everything and the non-Christian would lose everything.\n \n Choose the road you want to travel.\n \n Ray Connor\n Daleville\n \n\n \n And here's the response I just sent (though I doubt it will get posted because it doesn't praise the Almighty God like the anti-evolutionists' letters did).\n \n \nJudging by his Sept. 15 letter, Ray Connors is confused as to what the scientific theory of evolution actually is: it is a theory regarding biological change. As such, evolution has as much to do with the origin of the Earth, the distance of the Earth from the Sun, and the tilt of the Earth on its axis, as it does with why a rock rolls down a hill instead of up it: in other words, nothing. As many Creationists wrongly do, Mr. Connors has erroneously twisted the scientific theory of evolution into some overarching, all-encompassing, philosophical worldview.\n \n Mr. Connors goes on to make a couple errors in reasoning. First, he confidently asserts that the probability \"of a Christian going to Heaven is 100 percent.\" Not if the religious Jews are correct! In fact, then the probability of a Christian going to Heaven becomes 0. The probability also drops to 0 if the Muslims are correct, or if the Hindus are correct, or if the Jehovah's Witnesses are correct, or if the atheists are correct. In fact, even if certain Christians are correct, not all people who consider themselves to be Christians will go to heaven: the fundamentalist Baptist church I attended for a while held that Catholics were not true Christians and so would be going to hell. \n \n Ray then employs what is known as Pascal's wager. One major flaw with this logic is that it creates a false dichotomy: allegedly, there are only two possibilities, and they are mutually exclusive. First, are the two possibilities Ray listed mutually exclusive? No. Numerous people are both Christians and evolutionists. Second, are there actually only two possibilities? No. Where are the Jews, the Muslims, and the Hindus taken into account? Does Ray consider them to be Christians or evolutionists? \n \n",

   "Okay, one more down.\n \n On (or about) 09/15/2005, this response (one of two in the same edition!) was published\n \n \nWith regard to Rick Pierson's Aug. 28 letter about the theory of evolution, I think it is about time for evolutionists to admit that this theory on evolution can no more be proven than the Bible can prove God as Creator.\n \n That is correct; the Bible cannot and was not intended to prove that there is a holy, all-powerful, all-knowing God, the same God I firmly believe is Creator, not only of man and beast, but of the entire universe.\n \n You ask with a somewhat puzzled look how it is that one can believe that God is Creator of all things, living and not, if the foundation of your belief, the Bible, cannot be proven.\n \n The answer is faith.

Creationists' belief in God is accurately called faith. Their blind faith in their particular formulation of God is not based on empirical evidence and is highly subjective. Neither Creationists nor anyone else can confirm the existence of the imagined supernatural Creator, and that Creationists believe in their particular God and no others - while people of the various other religions of the world believe just as firmly in their own God, and reject the Creationists' - shows the highly subjective nature of religious beliefs. \n \n On the other hand, the confidence - what Creationists disingenuously mislabel as \"faith\" - evolutionists have in evolution is objective and based on empirical evidences. In fact, evolution has been confirmed by - and is accepted by - people from all across the globe, cutting through global, national, and regional - as well as many ethnic, cultural, and religious - boundaries. Biblical Creationism, on the other hand, is largely restricted to the United States, and even then, to just particular belts within it.\n \n Let me recap: blindly and unquestioningly accepting one particular form of unsupportable religious dogma leads to a belief in Creationism; critical thinking, rational thought, and a thorough examination of evidence, on the other hand, leads to confidence in the validity of evolution. Two vastly different types of \"faith\" are involved, yet Ray acts as though there is just one type and that it applies equally well to both Creationism and evolution.\n \n As far as whether or not Creationism should be taught in public schools, one answer is crystal clear: not in science classes! Creationism is religion, not science. In fact, the only relationship Biblical Creationism has with science is that the former grossly distorts the latter.\n \n",

   "And one that I sent a couple of days ago.\n \n From the 09/11/2005 Sunday paper (Dothan Eagle)\n \n \nI read the familiar position in an Aug. 28 letter by Rick Pierson. I say familiar, although I have never read any of Pierson's writings and I do not know him, though I would venture that he is educated, successful and genuine.\n \n In his opinion, he pointed that it is just about time we toss the thin, threadbare dogma of creation into the fire and don the fabulous new colors of Science (I think the ACLU still allows capitalization of words of deity).\n \n I am certain Mr. Pierson supposed he is right, and in good conscience must go on record.

And this one still intrigues me: Why must evolutionists (in an accidental science) refer to evolution's truly fantastic biological mysteries as being \"produced\" or \"designed\" (an exact science)?\n \n Lance Beasley\n Dothan\n \n\n \n \n And the response I sent:\n \n \nIn his letter published September 11, Lance Beasly gives the false impression that evolution has \"God isn't\" built into it. Despite what many Creationists imply, evolution is not atheistic. In fact, a large number of scientists and laypeople alike, called theistic evolutionists, believe in both evolution and God. Mr. Beasly also insinuates that scientists worship science as a deity. Attempting to label science as a religion is an erroneous, Creationist ploy. The alleged 'justifications' for such an absurd claim never hold water.\n \n Later, apparently puzzled by evolution, Mr. Beasly asks how the first animal could have appeared with the means to \"forage, digest, metabolize, excrete, respire and reproduce?\". He seems to believe that no organisms simpler than animals carry out these functions, leaving no way for the first animals to have acquired them through descent. However, unicellular paramecia alone forage for food (by means of chemotaxis), metabolize, digest food (using food vacuoles), excrete (eliminating wastes through a cytoproct), and reproduce. As far as respiration is concerned, paramecia, like the simplest animals, do not need a respiratory system because they are small enough that diffusion of gases into and out of their cells/bodies suffices. \n \n Finally, Mr. Beasley references C. S. Lewis's remark that \"genuine submission to the Christian God never disappointed\". That statement is patently false. Speaking from personal experience, after being freed from the shackles of religious mind control and becoming a freethinker, I was disappointed at having genuinely submitted to the Christian God. I realized I had lost money, wasted time, worried unnecessarily, been misled, and suffered ridicule. Indeed, just the knowledge that I had relinquished control over my own thoughts and reasoning to others was enough for me to be \"disappointed\". Many other freethinkers out there have shared these same experiences and feelings. \n \n",

Hicks\n Dothan\n \n\n \n \n And my response that I am sending off...\n \n \nIn his Sept. 16 letter, Gerald Hicks jumps immediately to an incorrect conclusion. He assumes that simply because the word \"hemp\" appears in the term \"hemp nettles\" they must be narcotic plants: they are not. So much for his attempt to discredit science by means of ridicule (\"a bunch of marijuana-smoking scientists\").\n \n Mr. Hicks is hopelessly lost as to the speciation event that occurred both in the wild and in the lab. Let me explain. A new species of hemp nettle occurred in nature first. Scientists then formulated a testable hypothesis about how that occurred (a process called allopolyploidy), and performed breeding experiments in the lab with the two presumed parent species. After only a few generations, a new lab-produced species arose: it had the same appearance as the one produced in the wild, as well as the same number of chromosomes - which differed from that of both parent species - and the lab-produced species was reproductively isolated from both parent species, while at the same time being fully capable of interbreeding successfully with the species that had arisen in the wild. The scientists' and nature's new species were one and the same. \n \n As to Mr. Hick's assertion concerning the main reason people refuse to believe in Intelligent Design, it is unfounded speculation. I, in fact, was a fairly well-known Intelligent Design proponent on the Internet for several years, as many hundreds of my posts at several Creation/Evolution forums - most under the monicker DNAunion - attest. The main reasons I eventually rejected Intelligent Design, in favor of mainstream evolution, do not have to do with the lifting of lifestyle restrictions. Rather, they were based on serious flaws in Intelligent Design my opponents pointed out over the years, and on the overwhelming scientific evidences for evolution to which I was exposed. \n\n \n \n Yes, I am done. But it took me an entire night to do. That is time that I really should have spent studying for school: embryology lecture notes, embryology slides, organic chemistry nomenclature, and so on.\n \n As I said, I may have to forfeit my debate with marc9000 due to time constraints. I imagine that if even one of my responses gets published, that it will be a catalyst for another series of responses by local Creationists.",

Currently, the imbalance is staggering. \n \n I've sent another letter to the editors, this time with revisions to the originals I already sent.\n \n \n \nThere is simply too much misinformation about science and evolution being printed in the op-ed section of The Dothan Eagle: the evolution side must be heard. \n \n But since I figured my original letters to the editor supporting evolution did not stand a chance of actually being printed, because they also expressed freethinking (instead of being religiously neutral or validating the Christian God), I decided to revise them so that they contain no potentially negative comments about Christianity: they discuss only science and evolution, as much as possible. I feel these \"cleaned up\" versions are fit to be printed in any paper, no matter what its religious leanings might or might not be.\n \n Instead of sending four separate letters (an individual letter to the editor for each letter printed in your paper as a response to my original one), I will send them together in one e-mail, setting off each one with in paired <letter-to-the-editor< and </letter-to-the-editor< tags. If this is not acceptable and you want me to send them one-by-one, just let me know and I will be glad to resend them in that manner.\n \n \n \n \n \n <letter-to-the-editor<\n In his letter published September 11, Lance Beasly gives the false impression that evolution has \"God isn't\" built into it. Despite what many Creationists imply, evolution is not atheistic. In fact, a large number of scientists and laypeople alike, called theistic evolutionists, believe in both evolution and God. \n \n Mr. Beasly also insinuates that scientists worship science as a deity. Attempting to label science as a faith-based religion is an erroneous, Creationist ploy. The alleged 'justifications' for such a claim simply do not hold water.\n \n Later, apparently puzzled by evolution, Mr. Beasly asks how the first animal could have appeared with the means to \"forage, digest, metabolize, excrete, respire and reproduce?\" He seems to believe that no organisms simpler than animals carry out these functions, leaving no way for the first animals to have acquired them through descent. However, simpler organisms do. For example, unicellular paramecia alone 'forage' for food (by means of chemotaxis), metabolize, digest food (using food vacuoles), excrete (eliminating wastes through a cytoproct), and reproduce. As far as respiration is concerned, paramecia, like the simplest animals, do not need a respiratory system because they are small enough that diffusion of gases into and out of their cells/bodies suffices. \n \n As to why evolutionists often refer to design in biology, we can look to Darwin for the general answer. In his later editions of \"The Origin of Species\", Darwin addressed objections some had raised about a presumed personification of nature in the term natural selection: basically, how can nature select, since selecting is considered a willful, conscious act? Darwin stated, \"Every one knows what is meant and is implied by such metaphorical expressions; and they are almost necessary for brevity. So again it is difficult to avoid personifying the word Nature ... With a little familiarity such superficial objection will be forgotten.\" Indeed.\n \n Rick Pierson\n Dothan\n </letter-to-the-editor<\n \n \n \n \n \n <letter-to-the-editor<\n Judging by his Sept. 15 letter, Ray Connors, like many others, is confused as to what the scientific theory of evolution actually is: it is a theory regarding biological change. As such, evolution has as much to do with the origin of the Earth, the distance of the Earth from the Sun, and the tilt of the Earth on its axis, as it does with why a rock rolls down a hill instead of up it: in other words, nothing. Taking the rest of his letter into consideration, Mr. Connors has erroneously twisted the scientific theory of evolution into some overarching, all-encompassing, atheistic, philosophical worldview. It is not.\n \n Despite their being outside the realm of evolution, let me address a couple of Mr. Connors' questions.\n \n - How is it that nature is in perfect harmony? \n \n Perhaps Ray has never watched a nature show, where, for example, a pride of lionesses tear chunks of bloody flesh from an overpowered victim while it is still alive. Perhaps Ray has never heard of AIDS or many other viral diseases that have killed millions of humans. And what of natural disasters, such as the tsunami in Sumatra, hurricane Katrina, and the many others? Ray is selectively recognizing only those things which fit nicely into his preconceived notions and simply ignoring anything that does not.\n \n - How is it that the sun is the exact distance from the earth that it must be?\n \n Apparently, Ray meant to imply that the Earth is the exact distance from the sun needed in order for life to exist. The idea of a narrow band of \"goldilocks\"orbits is a bit outdated, and clearly limited. For example, scientists today consider the possibility that life might exist on Europa.\n \n Rick Pierson\n Dothan\n </letter-to-the-editor<\n \n \n \n \n \n <letter-to-the-editor<\n In his Sept. 15 letter, Ray Robinson's improper usage of the term 'faith' amounts to equivocation. Creationists' belief in God is accurately called faith: their belief is not based on empirical evidence or objectively held and verifiable facts, but rather on divine revelation. On the other hand, the extreme confidence - what Creationists disingenuously mislabel as \"faith\" - evolutionists have in evolution is objective and based on empirical evidences. In fact, evolution has been confirmed by - and is accepted by - people from all across the globe, cutting through global, national, and regional - as well as many ethnic, cultural, economic, and religious - boundaries (while Biblical Creationism is largely restricted to the United States, and even then, to just particular belts within it). Two vastly different types of \"faith\" are involved, yet Ray acts as though there is just one type and that it applies equally well to both Creationism and evolution.\n \n Just so we are all clear on this: Creationists' commonly heard assertion that science (or just evolution) is a faith-based religion, worshipped as a deity by scientists, is both baseless and incorrect: it is mere rhetoric.\n \n As far as whether or not Creationism - that is, Creation Science, Scientific Creationism, Young Earth Creationism, and possibly other terms for the same Creationist belief system - should be taught in public schools, one answer is crystal clear: not in science classes! Creationism is not science: it is religion. That is not just my personal opinion, or just the opinion of evolutionists. Even William Dembski, a leading Intelligent Design proponent, states such. So too has the Supreme Court.\n \n Rick Pierson\n Dothan\n </letter-to-the-editor<\n \n \n \n \n \n <letter-to-the-editor<\n In his Sept. 16 letter, Gerald Hicks jumps immediately to an incorrect conclusion. He assumes that simply because the word \"hemp\" appears in the term \"hemp nettles\" they must be narcotic plants: they are not. So his attempt to discredit science by means of ridicule (\"a bunch of marijuana-smoking scientists\") fails.\n \n Mr. Hicks is hopelessly lost as to the speciation event that occurred both in the wild and in the lab. Let me explain. A new species of hemp nettle arose in nature first. Scientists then formulated a testable hypothesis about how that occurred (a process called allopolyploidy), and performed breeding experiments in the lab with the two presumed parent species. After only a few generations, a new lab-produced species arose: it had the same appearance as the one produced in the wild, as well as the same number of chromosomes - which differed from that of both parent species - and the lab-produced species was reproductively isolated from both parent species, while at the same time being fully capable of interbreeding successfully with the species that had arisen in the wild. The scientists' and nature's new species were one and the same. \n \n As to Mr. Hick's assertion concerning the main reason people refuse to believe in Intelligent Design, it is unfounded speculation. I, in fact, was a fairly well-known Intelligent Design proponent on the Internet for several years, as many hundreds of my posts at several Creation/Evolution forums - most under the monicker DNAunion - attest. The main reasons I eventually rejected Intelligent Design, in favor of mainstream evolution, do not have to do with the lifting of lifestyle restrictions. Rather, they were based on serious flaws in Intelligent Design \"theory\" my opponents pointed out over the years, and on the overwhelming scientific evidences for evolution to which I was exposed. \n \n Rick Pierson\n Dothan\n </letter-to-the-editor<\n \n\n \n \n My time spent on defending evolution locally. Dam, haven't spent more than 3 hours all weekend on school work.",

   "Well, it certainly doesn't pull any punches. Let us know if it gets any responses if published.\n\n \n I got the following little story in an email several months ago. Not intended to be considered a true story I'm sure, but makes a point.\n \n \n A woman was waiting on a bus with a friend. As the bus approached, the crowd pressed forward and she was pushed into the path of the bus. The bus struck her and an ambulance was called. Meanwhile, the friend called the woman's husband and told him, \"your wife has been hit by a bus. I'll call you when we find out what hospital she's been taken to.\" A short time later, the husband reveived another call. This time it was a police officer. \"I'm sorry to inform you sir, but your wife has been killed in a car accident.\" When the man expressed his shock that he heard that the injuries weren't that severe, the officer replied that there was no bus involved and she had been killed while a passenger in an automobile.\n \n From the looks of the story, the police officer and the friend are contradicting each other. Somebody is mistaken about what vehicles were involved and the nature of the woman's injuries. Or else one or both of these people called the wrong husband! In any event, if we were reading this account in two different newspapers (one story from the officer and one from the friend) it is not hard to assume the accounts were mixed up. If you read those stories, you'd want to ask some more questions to find out what really went on.\n \n As it turns out, both the friend and police officer were one hundred percent correct in every detail. The woman had been hit by the bus. Before the ambulance arrived, a passerby offered to take her to the hospital. While en route in that car, the woman was involved in the fatal auto accident. The two stories can be completely harmonized, omitting nothing. Had someone tampered with either story to erase the contradiction, the final story would not have been true to the actual events. So leaving the stories as they are, even with the apparant contradictions, is a more honest and credible option. That's how the Bible comes to us.

   "Well by all means, harmonize the contradicting stories related to Jesus' birth!\n \n 1) Matthew has the family head south to Egypt after Jesus' birth. \n \n The magi from the east see the magical \"Jesus was born here\" star and follow it to the house where Jesus, Mary, and Joseph are. After worshipping Jesus some, the magi leave: that night, the holy family leaves Bethlehem and goes south to Egypt.\n \n \n 2) Luke has the family head north to Jerusalem and then farther north, back to Nazareth, after Jesus' birth. \n \n Jesus is circumcised on day 8 and then, as soon as the time of purification according to the Law of Moses was complete - that's 40 days for a son - they leave Bethlehem and go north to Jerusalem. Then after completing everything required by the Law of the Lord in Jerusalem, then head off north again all the way back to Nazareth.\n \n \n \n Those two stories produce a direct contradiction: a family cannot head BOTH south AND north at the same time.\n \n \n Here are a couple of attempts to harmonize these two stories.\n \n 1) Trying to smash the two accounts together into the same overlapping time frame fails. Luke's telling leaves no time for the family to flee to Egypt and await Herod's death, then come back to Bethlehem and then Jerusalem to complete all the things needed to satisfy the Law of Moses and the Law of the Lord. And even if there was enough time - which there isn't - trying to harmonize the two accounts this way would just lead to another contradiction, since Matthew's story about the trek to Egypt says that on their return trip, the family avoided Judea, turning aside and going to Nazareth instead.\n \n 2) The only remotely feasible attempt to smash the two accounts together requires that they discuss different, non-overlapping periods of time. We have to take great liberty with our interpretation and our manipulation of gospel stories.\n \n Apparently, as told by Luke, Jesus was born in Bethlehem and on day 40 the family left for Jerusalem, then after a short time there went back home to Nazareth ... there was no miraculous star pointing out Jesus' birth; no magi came from the east to worship baby Jesus; and King Herod was not out to kill the young Christ. Luke does say that every year the family returned to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover. So we can get the family back to Jerusalem, for a brief period, after Jesus' birth: perhaps as much as a year later. But then, to add in Matthew's account, the family must have left Jerusalem and went back to Bethlehem: a trip that is not mentioned in either gospel: we have to simply assume for ourselves that this happened. In this rather forced scenario, only now, possibly a year after Jesus' birth, is a magical star heralding Jesus' past birth seen by the magi. Only now does the star mysteriously begin moving along the sky, directing the magi to the location of Jesus' past birth, which the family has apparently returned to (though not mentioned in the Bible). And only now does Herod converse with the magi and come to want to kill Jesus. And only now, after the magi leave, does the family flee to Egypt and await Herod's death. \n \n First of all, we have to ask ourselves, \"If this is what actually happened, then why is Luke completely silent about these latter historically and spiritually important events?\" After all, this is all Luke's gospel says about the family making it back to Nazareth after Jesus' birth: \n \n \n\"When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they [left Jerusalem and] returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth. And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him. Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover. When he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom.\" \n (Luke 2:39-42) \n \n\n \n They returned to Nazareth and then it was not until Jesus was 12 years old that the next key event in his life - according to Luke - occurs. Where's the mention of the magical \"Jesus was born here\" star? Where's the mention of the magi from the east? Where's the mention of the important trip down to Egypt, and the family living there until King Herod dies? Where's the mention of King Herod's having all boys under the age of 2 years old killed in Bethlehem and the surrounding area? All mysteriously missing. Luke has the family return home to Nazareth, then make the normal yearly trips to Jerusalem for the Feast of Passover, until Jesus is 12 years old. It's an uneventful period for Jesus: which is quite inconsistent with Matthew's version.\n \n Second, this smashing of the two gospel accounts together in tandem would make Matthew's version not a story of Jesus' birth, despite its being understood that way, but of later events in Jesus' young life (again, events not mentioned in Luke, who presents the same period of Jesus' life as quite uneventful: nothing worth noting).\n \n Third, what of this mysterious \"Jesus was born here\" star? It apparently showed up at the time of Jesus's birth: not afterward. But in the above scenario, it's not until a year or so after Jesus' birth that the magi show up. So did the star just hang out in the sky for a year or so waiting for the magi to finally notice it? Or did the magi notice it right away but not really care, for a year or so, and then finally decide to check it out?\n \n I want you to provide a legitimate way to harmonize these two accounts.",

This is argumentum ad ignorantiam.\n \n Describing a pathway would not be a \"test\" per se of the claim \"scientists will not uncover a continuously functional Darwinian pathway from a simple precursor to the bacterial flagellum.\" It would simply be a falsification.\n \n More importantly, \"Behe's means of detecting such design\" has already been falsified, as molecular systems for which we have described evolutionary pathways fit Behe's definition of \"irreducible complexity.\" This caused Behe to redefine the term, and after it was falsified yet again, he let Dembski have a try. (This is a classic case of \"moving the goalposts\" syndrome, a common creationist affliction.) According to Dembski's definition, the ID proponent now has to prove a universal negative to support a claim of irreducible complexity.\n (Here's a philosophical hint: you can't prove a universal negative.)\n \n The \"explanation\" for falsifying intelligent design given by Gonzalez and Richards is nothing but mumbo-jumbo. The falsification proposals have absolutely nothing to do with a designer, which could also be said for their basic \"correlation of conditions\" argument. Absolute nonsense.\n \n \nIf you don't believe Darwinism consists largely on attacks of I.D. - visit talkorigins sometime.\n\n If you believe that \"Darwinism\" consists largely of attacks on ID, actually read talkorigins (or -- you know -- Darwin himself) sometime.\n \n It would really behoove you to pick a specific topic and stick to it. I suggest you pick one that you'd like to discuss, start a new thread, and stick to the topic at hand. When you sufficiently understand that topic, pick another and do it again.",

   "That's just friggin insane. Darwinism was superceded before you were born. But most of his theories have been upheld, by further hypothesis, prediction and testing. Essentially, Darwin was correct. \n\n \n Superseded / correct - which was it? \n \n \nNevertheless, it is ignorant to argue against \"Darwinism\" since there aren't any Darwinists alive today. In fact, the neo-Darwinists are mostly dead, since that particular research movement took place in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\n \n Darwinists are a lot like liberals - both often refuse to admit who they really are. If they won't admit their principle, they can draw from contradicting arguments to \"refute\" an opponent. \n \n \nIt is really, really ignorant to argue against \"Darwinism.\" It indicates that you don't have the integrity to educate yourself about the facts before you argue against them. \n\n \n The same can be said about those who argue against I.D.\n \n \nIf you had the honesty to research the matter, you would know that evolutionary theory is about 150 years old, while \"creation science\" in only about 30 years old, and IDCreationism is about 10 years old. Your claim is stupid. You claim that evolutionary biologists argued against an unfounded assertion some 120 to 140 years before they were made.\n \n That's par for a creationist.

   "You obviously need to re-read this thread, where all of these ridiculous assertions have been dismissed, despite your squirming, misinterpretations, and ignoring points. I'm going to re-read it too, to remind me of the intellectual capacity of who I'm talking to. \n\n \n Yes, you had a self proclaimed victory there. There were about 9 of you against me in that one.

Could only 8 of you have handled it? \n \n Did you see my post #54?\n \n \nWhat I'm saying is that when six different argument angles come at me all at once, if I try to respond to all of them, it takes me six times as long as it did each individual poster. If I respond to only three or four, and leave out the frivolous ones (did I spell that right?) then it can look like I was stumped by the frivolous ones. Nothing I can do about it.

   "(Quotes presented out of original order for the purpose of grouping like points.)\n \n \nMaybe you should actually read it.\n http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/faqs-creationists.html\n\n So you find the FAQ on creationists and consider it a representative sample of the site? While it is most certainly true that a good portion of the talkorigins site deals with creationist nonsense, to say that T.O's dismantling of said nonsense means that the whole of Darwinism is \"largely an attack on ID\" is ludicrous.\n \n I notice you avoided mentioning Darwin's writings, which was certainly the correct move for you. After all, considering that ID only started making a big splash in 1987 (immediately after creation science was banned from the classroom, if that tells you anything), how did scientists like Dobzhansky and Futuyma do any work before then? This of course leads us back to Darwin's first book, published in 1859. How much of Origins of Species was anti-ID, marc?\n After you've explained that, you need to explain why basic evolutionary concepts such as homology and sexual selection are \"largely an attack on ID,\" why the chemistry behind the dating of fossils is \"largely an attack on ID,\" and why our observing speciation events is \"largely an attack on ID.\"\n \n \n \nYes, you had a self proclaimed victory there.\n\n Victory tends to happen in a debate when one side has completely destroyed the arguments that have been presented by the other side. You failed to back up a single one of your points, so I couldn't possibly lose.\n \n \nThere were about 9 of you against me in that one.\n\n Ironically, that wasn't a representative sample. If scientists with degrees in relevant fields were debating this topic, it would be more like 999 against one. (See also below.)\n \n \nWhat I'm saying is that when six different argument angles come at me all at once, if I try to respond to all of them, it takes me six times as long as it did each individual poster.\n\n\n See below.\n \n \n It would really behoove you to pick a specific topic and stick to it. I suggest you pick one that you'd like to discuss, start a new thread, and stick to the topic at hand. When you sufficiently understand that topic, pick another and do it again.\n\n And in a weeks time I'll bet I'd have 30 of you insulting me. Thanks, but no.\n\n No, see, this is why I suggested picking one topic and sticking to it. If 1000 evolutionists show up to debate you, you still have to defend just one topic. Anyone attempting to derail or sway the thread can be safely ignored with an explanation that the thread concerns only that one topic.",

   "Darwin had no knowledge of genes, or even how the method of inheritance worked (Mendel was a contempory of his, but his work was overlooked until some time after their deaths) hence why Darwin's theory of evoution by natural selection remains true yet you will not find many 'Darwinists'. Its like looking for a newtonian physicist in a theoretical physics department of a university. Or to bring things more up to date, Einstein is outdated and has been superseceded by more modern adaptations of his theories and some things he didn't know about - however he wasn't wrong, just incomplete.\n \n People who study evolution are called evolutionary biologists.",

   "Superseded / correct - which was it?\nHow unbelievable that it is necessary to conduct lessons in language on the internet. Pay attention now. The distinction here seems to be at the limits of your comprehension. There is a difference between \"Darwin\" and \"Darwinism.\" Thus, Darwin was essentially correct in the statement of his theories but Darwinism has been superseded by the modern synthesis with the addition of genetics, population genetics, molecular biology, ecology, etc.\n \nDarwinists are a lot like liberals - both often refuse to admit who they really are. If they won't admit their principle, they can draw from contradicting arguments to \"refute\" an opponent.\nClearly you have some political axe to grind. Wouldn't it be better if you actually learned what you were talking about instead of making things like that up without foundation? You make yourself look foolish.\n \nThe same can be said about those who argue against I.D.\nNow you're just being a crybaby. Those who argue against IDCreationism are well informed about IDCreationism as well as evolutionary biology. That is why IDCreationism has gained no respect as anything more that belief in a fairy tale among scientists. The problem is that the target audience of IDCreationism it composed of the uneducated and scientifically illiterate who are too lazy to make any effort to learn. It is much easier to answer any unknown with \"God musta...oops - I mean - some unknown intelligent designer musta done it.\"\n \nDisagreement between \"natural origins\" and creationism go back a lot further than 150 years. The Bible has been around longer than 10 years.\nNo need to get so silly about it. Grimm's fairy tales have been around longer than 10 years too. That doesn't give them any status in science. And before Darwin, it was actually scientists who were creationists that went looking for evidence of Noah's flood and found that there wasn't any. But for the weak of faith who demand that their god inform them exactly of the day by day process of creation, Darwin was too much. But still, there were only minor confrontations caused by the efforts of the religiously motivated to keep science out of science classes. \"Creation science\" contrary to your uneducated claim, arose in the 1960s. It was actually made famous by Henry Morris (a hydraulics engineer) from the ideas he took from 7th Day Adventists. And of course, it is the height of ignorance to believe that the latest movement to replace science with religion, IDCreationism, has anything to do with the Bible or that it is older than 10 or 15 years.\n \n What's really funny about both \"creation science\" and IDCreationism is that although both claim to be science, neither can actually show any research projects that have offered a single new piece of information to the scientific world. Neither can actually point to a single advancement of science that was published in a scientific publication.",
