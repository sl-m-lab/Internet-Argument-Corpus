   "Let's take one thing at a time.\n Before we start, a question or two for you.\nOkay.\n \n \n When was the last time you were inside a public school building? \nLast week.\n \n \n Have you had paid experience as a public school teacher?\nNo.\n \n \n\n After you answer those, then we can see just what expertise you have in the field.\nMy expertise in the field of teaching has little to do with what should be taught. Just as a car dealer/salesman is not necessarily qualified to design the car or determine what features should be included on it, a teacher is not nesessarily qualified to determine what the program should include to improve the crop of graduates into the work force. That is, being a teacher is not a stand alone qualifier for that job. Teachers would certainly be valuable in gathering information about what is going on in the schools, but that does not necessarily qualify them to solve the problems and \"reform\" the system. A good teacher is by definition good at teaching. That does not mean that the good teacher is capable of determining the best program to teach.\n \n I think there's quite a difference between trying to reform the entire public school system and trying to reform a wayward local school system. The local scene would seem easier to fix. Problems vary from state to state, county to county and section to section within the counties. I'd expect more success to come from a local effort than from a global effort. Each school is a separate entity even though some solutions may work at all locations.\n \n Were I appointed to a committee to study the problems in a local system, my first suggestion for data gathering would be to poll the students, the teachers, the administrators and all of their staff including maintenance and operational staff. Have all of them provide input into the list of problems...as they see it. Have them do it anonomously if they choose to so no pressure is applied to those whose jobs depend on pleasing their bosses. (This of course, applies to the hourly workers only...the teachers can't be fired. After all, they're UNIONIZED!)\n \n \n\n 1. Just exactly what are the problems that have been created by the NEA and the AFT? Please be specific.\nThe biggest problem I see is the creation of a system in which there is no accountability. If teachers were graded by their ability to teach as measured by the improvements in their student's test scores, we would be firing teachers on a regular basis rather than accepting them regardless of their effectiveness.\n \n Lowering the standards to make the teachers look good (but done in the name of increasing the number of graduates) is another problem created by NEA and teachers unions. We are graduating XXXXXX today simply because they have reached the age at which they should graduate. That takes away from the meaningfulness of the earned diploma...'cause EVERYBODY gets one.\n \n ...but we don't want to hurt anybody's feelings by keeping score anymore. This concept has been introduced by liberal thinking people who are systematically equalizing things that don't need to be equalized.\n \n \n\n 2. If not the teachers, just exactly who do you believe should determine what the students should learn, the methods used to teach them, and the information to be taught. Please explain your reasoning. If your answer is \"the public\", please explain why you would not also extend the same answer to physicians, attorneys, and accountants.\nWell, the members of the committee should certainly come from the public that is concerned with the schools in question. However, some good ideas about what should be taught in school might come from interviewing criminals in prison. I don't understand your extension to physicians, attorneys and accountants. I would certainly be happy to include them on the committee to improve the school system.\n \n Your idea of letting all teachers do it all is like hiring the fox to watch the hen house. It would lead to a stronger teacher's union and even less valuable education.\n \n \n \n \n\n 3. Since we agree that there are in fact incompetent teachers, please explain why and how they were not detected by management in their first three probationary years and dismissed from their positions. If you believe it was due to administrative incompetence, please explain how you would hold administrators more accountable.\nThe administration may be the biggest part of the problem. I would guess that most of them, principals, superintendents and executives in the school system are most all members of the NEA. Besides, incompetence in teachers is hard to discern unless we are allowed to administer impartially graded tests to determine how well the teacher performed. The teachers union refuses to do so.",

   "Jim,\n Actually, I agree with about 85% of what you say.\n I think you are on to some good ideas.\nWell, you should agree with all of it. I think I am right on all counts.\n \n \n\n My primary objection is to your stress on the negative effects of unionization on education. Unionization came about as a response to arbitrary practices by administrators who would give or withhold teacher pay based upon how brown the teacher's nose was.\nSchools are meant to benefit students, not teachers. The politics getting in the way of fair promotions is just as unwarranted as the union-generated protection of incompetent teachers. The administration procedures and rules regarding pay can be addressed in the list of problems that the system now has. The curriculum is just part of the process. School security, school floor plans, school playground plans, school entrances and exits, school operational hours and all sorts of things enter into the bag of issues that can contribute to the overall improvement of the system.\n \n Letting the teachers run the entire school system and determine what can and cannot be done to them is almost as bad as letting congressmen run the nation and vote themselves raises.\n \n \n \n On the other hand, I think the idea of inviting people from the world of work in to assist in planning curricula is quite valuable. They are the ones who have to deal with our students after they leave us, and I think it's important to consider their ideas. \nTrue. They are the end users of the school's product...supposedly educated children. Not only what they learn but how well they learn it (a measure of the intended effectiveness of the school system) is important.\n \n My mental list of concerns about the current school system has less to do with curriculum and more to do with control of students and teachers to maximize the potential value of the graduates by increasing the amount of useful knowledge carried away and increasing their ability to find satisfaction in contributing whatever it is that they choose to contribute to the betterment of mankind.\n \n\n I would object if education were merely directed at turning kids into cogs in the industrial/financial machine. Kids need to see the world's beauty as well, whether it is expressed in a Shakespeare sonnet, a Bach fugue, or a Mondrian painting.\nExposure to the arts is certainly important to society. There are those though that have no interest in it and cause a waste of resources when forced to take classes for which the probability of future use of knowledge gained by that student is near zero. A young boy who wants to work on car engines rather than visit an art museum may be totally misplaced in an art program. In my opinion, arts should be elective. In a well run preschool/kindergarten/middle-school program, the artists will surface and become interested in high school art classes. Teach them art and leave the others to what they want most...unless it's illegal.\n \n \n \n\n Finally, I have a problem with gearing teachers' raises to their students' performance on a test or series of tests. It neglects what else is going on in kids' lives. It's difficult to concentrate on a test if you are two weeks late or if you were up all night listening to your parents' violent argument or if you have been evicted and are living in the family car. I have had all of those situations and I speak from experience. \nUnfortunately, there is no other way than to evaluate the students to determine the effectiveness of the teaching sessions that happen between tests. Standardized tests given nationally are used to rank school systems. Why not use standardized tests to rank teaches?\n \n Teachers use tests to evaluate their students familiarity with the subject matter. I doubt any self-respecting teacher would change a student's F to an A based on an excuse that his parents had a fight the night before the test and upset him so much he failed the test. \n \n \n\n All in all, I appreciate your thought about the issue. My grandkids are 9, 6, 3, and 2, and I want, as does every other parent and grandparent, to be sure they have the best possible education for this rapidly changing world. After all, they will probably work at jobs that have not yet been invented.\nIt never hurts to talk about improving education. What is important to me in any proposed revamp of ailing educational systems is to include the privilege of choice in most of the subjects to be taken. Basic math and accounting, reading and writing in the native language, social skills and a few other subjects should be required for all students.",

   "Oh...OH...OHHHH let me jump in.\n \n The public education system (and from my personal experience, some private education systems) fail to educate.\n Fortunatly, I don't send my kids to 'school' to learn but to interact with a variety of people with differing personality styles so that they may better deal with them when they grow up into the work force.\n \n Let me give you 2 examples from my life.\n \n My eldest daughter is nearing 18 and going into her senior year of high school. She even has some college credit under her belt. Nearly every aspect of her educational push mirrors mine of 20 years ago. Except, well, she's a straight A student and a type A personality.\n The main problem I see with her is.\n SHE CAN NOT WRITE!\n \n Her spelling is horrendous as is her grammar and word usage.\n Yet, consistantly she scores A's.\n She's in honors classes too.\n \n She's too caught up with the way many teachers seek to stroke the egos and focus on a 'healthy self-esteme'. And with an outgoing 'star' student, not only does she get smoke blown up her backside but, she, like many popular students I've noticed at times, is allowed to slide by a little too often.\n \n \n Then there's the opposite extreme.\n My 11 year old son. being taught the same way but having slight learning disabilities. Very intelligent and creative yet totally unable to stay on task unless it's something he's really into.\n This past year, as a hyper active (yet not quite helicopterish) parent, I've communicated via e-mail and personal meetings numerous times that the son does have his homework done, he forgets it in his backpack for days at a time and if work isn't being turned in, I need to be contacted. Which, when a child is failing, seems to be a mandatory thing to do.\n All of his teachers except his science teacher caught on.\n With some difficulty they complied with his actual needs to help him academically...except the science teacher.\n Several times, he'd come home and state he's been missing work for weeks.\n I'd then go directly to his teacher and find out what it is and ensure it was turned in the next day. Also, repeatedly asking that weeks not go by before I find out that work is missing.\n Anyway, he had a project he'd been working on. In the week before school let out, it sat in his backpack daily until he came in one day saying he couldn't turn it in because the teacher said so.\n I went immediatly to the school, and confronted the teacher and principal that this was a failing of the teacher to not notify me that the son was failing and missing work. He had the project in his backpack the entire week and the teachers had been repeatedly made known that this was one of his chief problems that borders on OCD. Pushing the blame onto the student only goes so far.\n They ended up accepting the project.\n That very day, I went home and found a 'progress report' that was supposedly sent out days ago. It showed that he was infact missing 3 assignments. ALL the ones he was to do AFTER the last time I visited the teacher for the very same problem. Nearly 2 months worth of work.\n I contacted a lawyer to see about progressing with a lawsuit of some sort.\n His Grade for that grading period would have been an F+. 1 pt below passing.\n All the work he did turn in was A's and a C. With a in-class project of a D (only because his teacher changed what he was to do at the last moment, wasting weeks of his work on a different project he was nearly done with).\n \n \n So, you want to know the end result?\n \n Somehow, magically, he passed with a C for the grading period.\n Granted I had a hard time figuring out the math used in assessing his F+ grade but from where I'm standing, he was 'given' a passing grade ONLY because I was a loud mouth parent who was one of the FEW actively involved parents (per the principals comments) and didn't appear to be someone who'd accept the F.\n I guess they guessed right since I had contacted a lawyer...\n \n So, is this a reflection of the education system?\n Is it a reflection of 'teachers'?\n \n My personal experience has been one of persistant observations of BIAS with teachers. Those who allow their pets to slide by with a few less red marks on their papers compared to equal work from a less favorable student.\n I guess that kinda reflects real life at times.\n \n \n Fortunalty, most of my sons useful education is done by myself and that I am capable of answering most all of his questions or have the resources to find them out with him.",

   "Determining what the students need to learn should not be a teacher task.\n\n I somewhat agree. People who work or research or practice in a particular field generally have a better idea of the most important subject matter than the average teacher whose degree is in teaching. That said, the people who teach for a living are the ones who need to have input to make sure that the appropriate steps to the ultimate goal can be organized.\n \n \nIn some cases, even the methods of teaching and the information to be taught should be determined by someone other than teachers.\n\n Different students learn best in different ways. The best person to figure out the best approach for a group of students is the person who spends time with them and sees what works for each one the best. Those would be the teachers.\n \n \nSome are great teachers. Some are truly incompetent.\n\n I can't agree with you more. I have been stunned at the incompetence of some of my co-workers. I see no less than two problems with this:\n 1) Education degrees underemphasize content knowledge. I struggle to understand how a teacher can effectively teach material of which he or she has but a rudimentary understanding, but colleges seem to keep churning out education grads who think they know what they want to teach without knowing anything about it.\n 2) It is too easy for incompetent people to become teachers. As incredible as this sounds, it is true. I've taken the qualification tests; they're not very challenging, and the minimum qualification scores are amazingly low. I'll discuss how these people can remain teachers below.\n \n \nIf teachers were graded by their ability to teach as measured by the improvements in their student's test scores, we would be firing teachers on a regular basis rather than accepting them regardless of their effectiveness.\n\n You would also be firing effective teachers on a regular basis. Grades are not the indicator of teaching effectiveness as we would all like to think. They're often more an indicator of what a pushover the teacher is or of what a joke the class is. More on this below.\n \n \nBesides, incompetence in teachers is hard to discern unless we are allowed to administer impartially graded tests to determine how well the teacher performed. The teachers union refuses to do so.\n\n In my department, there are common assessments that actually could be used to do this. However, this still isn't fair, because one teacher has AP biology, another has honors biology and regular biology, and another has only regular biology. Does such a comparison reflect the effectiveness of the teacher or of the curriculum?\n \n \nOn the other hand, I think the idea of inviting people from the world of work in to assist in planning curricula is quite valuable.\n\n I agree with both of you. I think that this is where the non-traditional teachers have an edge; they did not go through an education degree program and instead studied to enter the workforce, then actually entered it. They have experiential knowledge that most teachers don't have.\n But then, maybe I'm biased. On the other hand, very rarely am I asked a question about either theory or practice that I can't answer, and I credit that to my science degree and my work experience.\n \n \nIn my opinion, arts should be elective.\n\n Disagree. One semester is required in my state, and the specific type of fine art can be chosen by the student. In my district, there's generic \"general art,\" painting and drawing, ceramics and sculpture, band, music theory, and multiple advanced courses.\n I'm about as un-artistic as people come, and even I recognize the importance of understanding the basics.\n \n \nStandardized tests given nationally are used to rank school systems. Why not use standardized tests to rank teaches?\n\n Because students are not randomly assigned to teachers. I have nothing but \"honors\" students who would likely better on standardized tests than non-honors students even if their teacher was largely incompetent.\n \n \nI doubt any self-respecting teacher would change a student's F to an A based on an excuse that his parents had a fight the night before the test and upset him so much he failed the test.\n\n No, but it would be naive to argue that fudging from an F to a D or a D to a C (for grade point purposes) due to outside influences doesn't occur. I'll rant more about this below.\n \n \nThe main problem I see with her is.\n SHE CAN NOT WRITE!\n\n How much reading did she do beyond the age of 10? I'm guessing very little.\n \n \nShe's too caught up with the way many teachers seek to stroke the egos and focus on a 'healthy self-esteme'.\n\n Partly because parents refuse to tolerate a metaphorical swift kick in the XXX when such would actually be beneficial in the long run. If we make a student feel bad, we face a livid parent who -- usually -- doesn't even care what the student did to begin with.\n \n \nWhich, when a child is failing, [contacting the parents] seems to be a mandatory thing to do.\n\n For what it's worth: in the majority of cases, when a child is failing, the parents don't care.\n But I'll agree that the science teacher probably dropped the ball. Here's my recommendation: get your son in the Section 504 program. Without any of this special documentation, the teacher isn't technically required to do any of that stuff. If your son doesn't meet the criteria for IDEA assistance, he may still be helped by 504.\n \n This type of stuff differs depending on the age of the student, in my opinion. When I was teaching seventh grade, I had a parent come in with smoke coming out of my ears and homicide on her mind. Her daughter's grade was quite poor because she hadn't turned in six assignments. It's not that she wasn't learning (and her mother ended up speechless when I made this clear), it was that her daughter was lazy.\n This same person proceeded to berate me for failing to teach her 10th grade daughter how to simplify square roots. It's not that I didn't do everything I could, it's that her daughter didn't know the multiplication tables that she should have memorized in third grade and repeatedly accessed ever since. You cannot blame the 10th grade teacher because a student cannot look at the number 49 and realize that it has a rational square root. You cannot blame the 10th grade teacher for not spending time during class helping students memorize third grade multiplication tables.\n \n \nSomehow, magically, he passed with a C for the grading period.\n\n Because a parent made a fuss. The system is broken such that parents don't have mere input and minor influence, they have leverage in many cases.\n \n It is a pain in the XXX to deal with livid parents, especially when they have no legitimate reason to be livid. I hate parent-teacher conferences because I know that I'll have a handful of angry parents, but at the same time I know I'll be able to shut them down. Most teachers probably don't think on their feet as well as I do and probably don't have the stomach for dealing with these parents.\n \n Why do the parents come in in the first place? I can assure you that it's not because of the quality of education. The vast majority of parents (and students) care only about the letter on the report card. These angry parents (and students) weren't mad because there wasn't learning occurring, they were mad because the grade wasn't what they expected it to be.\n \n I got a really interesting email several weeks ago. A rather outspoken parent was disappointed in her daughter's grade (a solid B) and lamented the fact that she had to study so hard. She observed that her daughter had ended up learning a lot of chemistry, had learned how to study, and now had a better understanding of what advanced classes and college courses would demand of her.\n No, seriously, read that again. Why was the parent displeased? Would you like to tell me how I failed this student? I saved the email. I'm putting it in my portfolio. I'm proud of such a review. I slept just fine that night.\n \n These discrepancies between grades and expectations arise because Johnny Goodgrades has had some teachers earlier in his education career that are pushovers or jokes. Their courses are unchallenging, urging robotic repetition of facts instead of understanding the concepts. Little Johnny may be good at rote memorization, so by the time he hits high school, he and his parents think he's a little Einstein. Then he actually has to understand concepts and apply knowledge. This is a new beast to Johnny, so he struggles.\n Parents blame the teacher. But they're blaming the wrong teacher. Why would they be mad at Mrs. Blowover? After all, Johnny got an A in her class! Since he has a C now, his current teacher must be to blame! Grab the pitchforks and torches!\n \n Many of my \"honors\" kids are not honors kids, but the system has convinced them and their parents that the opposite is true. They also realize that taking these challenging classes hurts their GPA, so they avoid the classes where they learn something and take the classes inflate their class standing. This is why we have numbskulls graduating high school thinking that they're damn smart, and why this dumbing down continues to seep into society.\n This whole GPA/class standing/valedictorian business is something that should also be addressed but probably isn't what you guys are looking for. That said, this is long, it's late, and I'm sleep deprived, so you can respond and we'll go from there.\n \n ETA: I realize I promised to explain how incompetent people remain teachers. I'll have to give the short version:\n Keeping your teaching job has so very little to do with actual performance or professional development and instead has almost everything to do with paperwork. Classroom observations constitute an alarmingly small part of the evaluation process. Professional development can be beneficial but is largely window dressing; worse, PD requirement fulfillment is rarely investigated.",

   " As a recent retiree (and the holder of an earned Doctorate in my field) from one of the \"innerest\" of inner-city schools, I take great offense at your characterization. \n\n \n Too bad you take offense. Maybe all the 'offended' educators are at least half the reason education discussion never gets anywhere in America. Besides, if you were as qualified as you imply, you'd know well that my observations are mightily documented by teachers themselves, students, parents, and administrators. And, that documentation, not personal unsubstantiated anecdotes, are all that really hold weight in an internet discussion. Or reasoned argument, based on rules of logic.\n \n Now, would you like some book recommendations for your time out in pasture? You seem unaware of what's being reported on teaching practices, and, in the world of education! And, as to what is going on in the '\"inerest\" of inner-city schools.'\n \n \n If you really want to point a finger of blame, look no further than your local statehouse. The ugly fact about urban education today is that the power elites do not really want to educate inner-city (read \"minority\") children. \n\n \n Perhaps. But I tend to think that most inner-city teachers don't either. Nor are they able.\n \n \n The military/industrial complex needs a steady stream of Deltas and Epsilons to be the modern day equivalent of hewers of wood and drawers of water to survive. \n\n \n Nothing wrong with being a hewer of wood or drawer of water. Though we hardly need the school system for that. I think, however, a problem arises as to what to do with the hewers' and drawers' children, given modern day child labor laws.\n \n \n Of course, they manage to let a small fraction of these kids through the gate, just enough so that they can say they do not discriminate. Our #1 is off to Columbia on full scholarship, and our #2 is doing the same at Stanford. \n\n \n They only let a small fraction through anywhere. Have you read the latest on how many students presently don't get into non-Ivy league 'quality' colleges with fantastic S.A.T. scores et al.? And how many applicants, at present, are from outside the U.s.A.? Plus, two people is not really a feather in the cap for your teachers. How many of your inner city students even go to college? You can't blame it all on the local statehouse. \n \n \n Only when 40% or more can do this can we say we have begun to improve urban education. \n\n \n Do what? Go to Ivy League colleges? 40%? What you suggest is mathematically impossible, given the nature of what an Ivy League college is. That is, they only allow a very small percentage of the population in from anywhere. That's what makes them the mystical Ivy League, and thus, bolsters their mystical argument that they provide a better education. (And quite apparently, they don't. So much for what 80 thous a year will buy you.)\n \n \n In my district, I was assigned to teach AP Psychology two years ago. Only problem was I had no textbooks. In the year just ended, I was assigned to teach AP European History. Same problem. Kids in suburban districts get two texts per class - one for school, and the other to take home for homework. \n\n \n I think supplies should be equal. If we abolished property taxes as a source of revenue for school districts, all things would be more so. What is your opinion on that? You didn't address the argument.\n \n \n Now, Antonia, how about some specifics: \n\n \n Whatever for? This is the internet. All that matters in an argument is what can be documented. Which you should know if you are well educated in the rules of logical argument. Instead of being a self-congratulatory overstuffed educator, accustomed to talking about himself and asserting arguments by authority.\n \n \n What urban schools have you observed? In what cities of our country?\n \n How many times?\n \n What are your academic qualifications?\n \n How many inner city teachers have you had conversations with?\n \n How many inner city students have you had conversations with?\n \n Was your high school in an urban, suburban, or rural setting?\n \n Have you ever taught in the inner city?\n \n How many wood chips did you have to place on your grill to generate this much smoke?\n \n Please be specific!\n\n \n Talk about projection. The only one generating smoke is yourself, as pasted above. \n \n And, btw, what exactly do you disagree with me about? (Besides the notion that you and your unionized brethren, particularly your gang on another forum, possess the characteristics I've mentioned. Or chagrin that I've rocked your boat. Or challenged your pompous egoistic authority. Or won't play your back-scratching game, here, either.) For if you are, indeed, a teacher, you've demonstrated every quality I've mentioned. As well as, in your other hang-out.\n \n Please be more specific about your disagreements, and using pastes, when responding. (It's easier, if you're not greatly offended.)\n \n For surely you're not suggesting that most inner-city teachers are just peachy keen. Or that students are, indeed, meat for your butchering block. Or that the educational system doesn't need an overhaul. Including your self-congratulatory friends elsewhere. Or that people, on the internet, should believe what you say because you also say you have a doctorate degree and have taught for 40 years. Which is a poor replacement for stating an argument, or specifying a disagreement, and backing it up with a source beyond your royal Self. \n \n So much for your also alleged American Ivy League education which should have taught you as much. Rather than how to bull poop. (But oh well. Bush graduated from Harvard, you know. So you're in good company insofar as what your alma maters produce.) \n \n And gee, I've known quite a few substandards with doctorates, too.\n \n Give me a reasonable conversation with a hewer and drawer instead, any day of the week. Who hasn't lost all originality by jumping through higher education hoops for salary increases in teaching.\n \n The only prima facie assumption, for an alleged 40 odd years in the American education system, is ability in political manuvering, image management, self-promotion, cattle herding, and bullying. Certainly not evidence that you are well versed in the subject of human learning.\n \n For that, you'll have to talk about something else besides your qualifications.",

   "I don't claim to know Binghamton well myself, but I have friends who do, and from about the same period as yourself. One grew up in reportedly the same socio-economic circumstances, as yourself, except likely much worse. For example, that individual never would have an opportunity to go to Columbia. That individual had a very hard childhood in that area, and one, I suspect, you might not even be able to imagine. Plus, we were very close, so I have fairly decent view on what poverty was like in the Binghamton area close to the time period you were allegedly there. And, I know what it's like to grow up in close-knit communities where everyone know everyone else's business. Even the birth control that failed when a neighbor's sibling was conceived.\n \n IMO, arrogance usually distorts our perspective on the world, and our ability to analyze material more rationally and accurately. So, if you feel entitled to be arrogant, you're not best serving the interests of the students in your community, IMO. I've watched you alienate people and their support for some time now. Because of this 'arrogance' you feel entitled to express. In education, and, on the immigration issue. On the immigration issue, btw, it was persons like yourself on both the left and the right who destroyed the possibility of an agreement for millions of persons living in the shadows -- because you were so arrogant and extreme, and unwilling to understand other people's viewpoints. And now all those people you professedly care about pay the price, including students of yours who don't have papers or whose families have been dumped on some street in Mexico. I don't think you would have been so insolent and uncompromising, had you been living that nightmare yourself. Had been taking such risks on behalf of yourself, instead.\n \n Plus, very simply, you forget that other people, besides teachers, have lives like your own -- have paid their life dues as well. So all your alleged teaching in the trenches doesn't give you the right to walk around crapping on people's heads, and then, realistically expecting them to turn around and support you, what you represent as a teacher, and all that you desire for teachers.\n \n On systemic education reform, I have already raised a number of substantive points. If you were not so arrogant, you might have been able to see past *red* and actually read the substance of my statements. As to your complaint on stating problems, I don't see how you can discuss solutions without having some meeting ground on what the problems themselves are. As Huey Newton once wrote (paraphrased), you can't go from A to C, before going to B, first.\n \n But back to the points I've already raised (who participates in the reform room, the tax structure, the same pedagogical practices for inner city students, changing the way teachers are selected, getting rid of archaic war horses like yourself ... ) -- I see no point in writing more, when you can't even talk about one or two major points already, and after I've repeatedly raised those points. Just your imaginings about fictitious characters in French literature.\n \n And thank you for the typo correction. Pastoral was my intended meaning. \n \n Look for what people are trying to say to you, Chester. Not what you wish they were saying.\n \n Finally, I don't know that I'll be communicating with you at all, anymore. I find you incredibly rude, and simply bent on mischaracterizing everything I say. In short, it's not an enjoyable experience, and I like to enjoy myself. I feel entitled, thus. Plus, if you want me 'to go away' -- I'll remind you that I have as much right to be here as you (and probably moreso -- since I notice, you've been kicked off and recycled several times). So, if you don't want to speak -- then go away yourself and talk to someone else. No one's making you talk to me.\n \n In sum, you seem a troubled man, corrupted by our crumbling system, and a sorry reflection on teaching. I think there are many of you out there. Literally sick in the head, from teaching in America for so many years. So, in short, IMO, the American system of education, particularly in the inner cities, destroys teachers, as people. (In other places, too, btw.) With you, as a good example, for all to witness, as to what happens to these human beings who intiailly wanted to help students learn. A long, long time ago.\n \n But the system, in which you are so clearly entangled, made sure -- you got over it. And then, helped others to, as well.\n \n I find it sad.\n \n Human beings need to feel that it's o.k. what they're doing. Will seek, to great extremes, to justify, rather than understand. Especially if they feel entitled to their arrogance.\n \n Peace to you.",

   "Hear, hear.\n\n \n Well, you see, that's your logical fallacy. Because while you are correct that there are shortages of people trained in specific subject matter (e.g. sciences, mathematics), they are quite correct to flood the schools, particularly inner cities right now, with teachers heavily trained in pedagogy. The problem is not that they have pedagogical training, but that they need further subject material expertise. And, that teachers with subject material expertise need much more background in pedagogy. That, many inner city teachers will fight, tool and nail, against having in their hallways. Because those teachers reveal the shoddy, secretive, collusive, and often illegal practices by which they have been controlling classrooms for years, and harming students, the children of parents from poorer neighborhoods. Who they really believe, in their heart of hearts, are inferior, and don't deserve the same practices as students from wealthier districts. So, for example, you can have someone with a doctorate in history, filled with himself and his importance in the front of a classroom, but extremely ignorant of how to treat other human beings. And extremely unable to engage in any meaningful discussion as to how people learn. Just an expert in tooting his own horn. Spouting his long memorized, politically correct lines, again and again. Take away the cliff notes, and there's not much happening. A one or two trick pony who learned how to walk in and out of the building many years ago. Any teacher, who calls a student \"stupid\", or implies they are less than human should have been out on their derrierre years ago. As a burn-out. And any teacher, whose reading comprehension is less than, and doesn't care, should have the finger pointed directly at them as to why Johnny still can't, either. What they want to bury, and but quick, is any person who sees through their facade, knows what a real teacher is really like.\n \n Eventually, the politics of how these teachers help each other hide what they do, in order to cover their messy butts, further themselves, and not their students, will be their undoing. Americans, increasingly, are fed up with that, as well. And you will see it on election day, and how willing they are to continue to support, among other things, unions. \n \n So give them pedagogy, folks. Out the ears. The pedagogy people won't play their game, or tell them, that's it's o.k. for them to treat your children like dirt. That's why the 40 odd year bearer of secrets doesn't want them there, in the hallways, either.

Stanford University's Linda Darling Hammond, executive director of the National Commission on Teaching in America's Future, says the situation is even worse in high poverty areas.\n \n LINDA DARLING-HAMMOND, Stanford University: In inner-city schools those proportions go way up to over 50 percent. In fields that have shortages, like mathematics and physical science, we have very high proportions of teachers who are not trained either in their field, or in teaching.

Personally, I think the ways in which teachers are evaluated have become too politicized.\n \n \nTrue. But having a rudimentary knowledge of the content area makes even impressive pedagogy woefully ineffective.\n\n \n Well, I think that's true, too. As I've stated a number of times, I support a background in both content area and pedagogy (among other things, in education training). But impressive content knowledge also becomes relatively meaningless against rudimentary pedagogical and/or education training. Or pedagogy that has been long shown as outdated.\n \n Some schools try to address this issue by hiring teachers with background in one area, upon the qualification that they will continue their training in another. For example, I knew a young, inspired, inner city teacher -- who'd paid tens of thousands for his education degree and pedagogical training -- hired in mathematics, upon the condition that he return to the classroom at the same time to complete an additional major in that subject. (In which he already had a certain amount of coursework, a certain degree of otherwise demonstrated strength in that area.)\n \n And even science teachers usually need additional training for managing hands-on classrooms. It's silly to expect that, simply because a person has an advanced degree in biology (or chemistry, for that matter), they can atuomatically handle a laboratory classroom of 30-50 students, lesson included. In fact, you might even have better luck there with a person trained more in education (including pedagogy). Even if their science degree is missing. It all depends, of course, on many individual factors.\n \n But basically, you want both. And I would hesitate to attack teachers, especially the inspired and well-meaning, and those who have paid tens of thousands out of their pockets for their degrees, simply because one is a pompous, self-centered, 40 something year war horse, who's never picked up more than the cliff notes for \"Pedagogy of the Oppressed,\" if he has even heard of the book, before today. And would be hard-stretched to talk about any major thinker representing \"modern education\" today. Based on what he criticizes. And what he is afraid of having, walking around in the hallways of his inner city school. From Dewey to Freire, from Montessori to Bloom, to Vygotsky to Jean Paul Piaget.

   "Chester,\n \n Here are, however, a few thoughts ...\n \n (1) Eliminate bureaucracy and standardization in teacher hiring. Go by various degrees, not credentials or licenses. Allow schools to hire people, not paperwork.\nHire them according to their ability to teach, not the mere fact that they call themselves teachers.\n \n \n \n\n (2) Allow teachers to teach. Greatly reduce standardized testing.\nStandardized testing is one of many ways to measure teacher effectiveness (ability to teach).\n \n \n\n (3) Promote self-reflection and life-long learners. Recognize and use alternative forms of assessment more widely. Possibly eliminate the traditional grading system. Certainly restrict it, carefully.\nThe traditional grading system, coupled with standardized testing is a way to measure teacher effectiveness. That is likely why most all colleges rely on SAT scores to determine which of the students applying will maximize the learning accomplished in the available classroom seats.\n \n \n \n\n (4) Socialize university education. Eliminate the concept of an Ivy.\nLeave the private schools to themselves. Offer the eager students free university level educations. Let those who don't want higher education join the workforce at will.\n \n \n \n\n (5) Before even considering teacher pay increases:\n \n (a) Eliminate corporal punishment, the onus on unions if they wish to survive. A society that does not recognize the corporal dignity of their children cannot educate them well.\n \n (b) Greatly increased pay rates for early childhood educators first. A society that does not recognize the importance of the people who educate our youngest children, or the importance of this developmental stage, before any other, cannot educate anyone else well.\n \n (c) Eliminate union-protected health insurance for teachers. Let them fight for, and support, the same things other Americans are deprived of. \n \n (d) Throw out more students so other students are not deprived of their right to learn, and their right to learn safely.\n \n (e) Close more buildings.\n \n (f) Open many smaller ones with more gardens.\n \n (g) Have students grow vegetables, raise animals, and build houses.\n \n (h) Visit art museums, play musical instruments, listen to Glenn Miller and Chopin, look at things with microscopes, fix old cars.\n \n (i) Read books by streams all afternoon, go for a walk in the park, write poetry, discuss the marriages of kings and queens, or how bridges were built by ancient American peoples.\n \n (j) Try building one yourselves. Discuss engineering and mathematics. Tell your the students the story of Hamlet.\n \n (k) Take a telescope to the top of a mountain, or up the fire escape of someone's tenement, and look at the stars all night. \n \n (l) Asteroid watch.\nYou want to do all of those things before even considering pay increases?\n \n \n \n \n \n\n Now go earn your keep.\n\n \n How will you be able to tell when that happens without grading the teacher.\n \n \n \n I think we're (USA Government Schools) falling way below the benchmark on teaching MATH, READING and LANGUAGE.

   "\n Actually, except for 5 (a), (c), and (d), I heartily support the rest of your proposals. \n\n \n re (a). Just why do you think corporal punishment should remain on the books? Have you used corporal punishment in a classroom?\n \n re (c). Teachers should have the same health care, or not, as every other American. Including teachers' children.\n \n re (d). Put those students in other small schools with gardens, but hire more police officers to be present in the classrooms, and with teachers who want to work especially with these students. There is absolutely no reason for students who need police officer supervision to be taking educational time away from other students. There is absolutely no reason for violent criminals, drug dealers, or a range of other characters to be in a public school setting with our children. And for teachers promoting such a notion, and panning themselves off as educators, to then be paid $150,000 per year.\n \n \n Of all your points, the one I agree most strongly is vastly improved salaries for primary school teachers. \n\n \n I wasn't refering to primary educators, but those working with even younger groups, before the elementary level. Who make anywhere from $6. to $8. an hour, if even that high. When you start advocating their salaries be raised to $150,000 per year, or can explain why corporal punishment should not be legal in a public school system, I might consider high school teachers educated enough to be deserving.",

My specific plans would come after listening to a lot of other people. I don't have a magic plan.\n \n Contrary to what you may believe ought to be given as decision rights to the almighty NEA and teachers unions, I think they should have little say so in the matter...just teach what they are told to teach...and become accountable for the lack of effectiveness that has become obvious to many in many school districts.\n \n Good teachers are certainly required for a successful educational system, but they do not need to run the show or have the power to protect their own jobs through some stupid claim of tenure, regardless of their detectable ineffectiveness as a \"teacher\".\n \n I agree with Antonia's suggestions to expose students to real life things outside of the classrooms. Just because I would put emphasis on math, reading and language does not mean other things would not be taught. A student that reads well and understands the proper use of the language of choice (or any foreign language they may prefer to study) will excel in any chosen field of study. The need for math skills is within most all people...at least regarding the basics. The more sophisticated math skills can still be reserved for the brainiacs that want to go that far.",

   "Standardized testing is one of many ways to measure teacher effectiveness (ability to teach). \n\n \n Well, I'm not suggesting we completely eliminate standardized testing. However, I think it could serve its more useful purposes when applied with greater restraint. Also, a teacher may have been relatively ineffective, as demonstrated testing-wise, but I don't think that necessarily demonstrates a person's inability to teach. Part of teaching involves ability to reflect upon assessment results, and do something about it. For that, I also think teachers need a certain zone of emotional safety, that appears sorely lacking in our society. They're so defended, at present, it's hard to talk honestly with them about anything.\n \n \n Leave the private schools to themselves. Offer the eager students free university level educations. Let those who don't want higher education join the workforce at will. \n\n \n I think I like this, better. O.K. \n \n Perhaps the students could fulfill X no. of years public service requirements in order to earn that education. Teaching, working in hospitals, the military, with the homeless, VISTA or Peace Corps, etc. But otherwise \"free\" and provided by the government, if desired.\n \n \n You want to do all of those things before even considering pay increases?\n\n \n In a manner of speaking, yes.

Development of these three skills can improve the quality of education and use of that education no matter what discipline is being pursued.\n\n \n Freire taught workers to read in 45 days. The unions and most educated teachers know about this. It's no big secret getting the basics. \n \n If students from certain neighborhoods are failing terribly in those benchmarks, assess them individually, break them into further related groups, and have intensified study specific to whatever subject they need advancement in.\n \n But look, if they're still not ready, for example, to learn reading .. well, perhaps they need more time before they will be.

Thanksgiving is a four-day weekend for many if not most professions. I'll add one week of my Christmas vacation to my tally of \"off-time,\" but the other was spent working. We have no additional \"winter vacation.\" I spent my Spring Break working, too.\n \n \nIn my district, teachers receive stipends for everything they do above and beyond contracted duties with the exception of Site Base participation.\n\n But this is standard, and not just for teaching contracts.

I volunteered for an assistant's position (for no stipend, of course) and despite the fact that some of the people I answer to say I should have a second prep period, I don't (and won't) get it.

   "If you want to come in here arguing that teaching is universally a cushy job, be prepared to hit some resistance.\n\n \n Universally? Now where did I use the word universally? Let's stick to the United States of America, please. When discussing the teaching profession, there are a number of factors to consider which sadly, many teachers never seem to factor into their salaries as benefits. First of all:\n \n From CBS news:\n \n His study comes as the proportion of male teachers is at its lowest level in 40 years. Roughly 80 percent of teachers in U.S. public schools are women.\n \n 80% female. 80%. Now why do you think that is? Could it be because the hours and vacations are compatible with their own children's schedules? Health benefits? Maternity leaves? Tenure? Pension? Doesn't the very nature of teaching lend itself to females more so than males? \n \n If we take a look at the top 10 reasons why the White House lists as reasons to become a teacher, we see the following:\n \n From Yesican.gov:\n \n kindness - patience - understanding - joy - love - passion - sharing\n \n While men are not devoid of those qualities, in American society we definitely assign those characteristics more readily to females than to males. Any male deciding to go into teaching must be aware in advance that this is a heavily female dominated profession, always has been and continues to be. It is the ONLY profession where after 3 years, short of the position being eliminated or being the new millennium's Lizzie Borden, a woman's job is secure and guaranteed Step increases in pay, year after year. \n \n As taxpayers, every time our districts put the annual increase of an average of 5-7% on our school taxes up for a vote, we are told, \"It's for the children!\" Baloney! The bulk of the increases go towards health and retirement benefits for the teachers and administrators.\n \n I don't buy the whining from teachers about how much work they do after they get in their cars to drive home. Assuming a teacher arrives before the bell rings and stays half an hour after the children leave, they are in the workplace for 7 hours. 7 x 182 = 1274 At an average salary of $47,000, that works out to over $36.00 an hour. Not bad. In my area, teachers earn upwards of $60 an hour for after school tutoring. I have no idea what state electrolyte works in, but even if this practice is considered \"illegal\", I assure you it is widespread. I can't imagine a single parent who is privately paying a teacher to tutor their child, turning in that teacher to licensing authorities. Parents want what is best for their children and for their children to succeed. Reporting a teacher for \"extracurricular\" tutoring would be cutting off their nose to spite their face.\n \n (I had included links to my sources but this software says I must have 10 posts before I am allowed to include links. Sorry about that.)",

Let's stick to the United States of America, please.\n\n Fine; that's what I meant anyway, that teaching isn't a cushy job everywhere in the US.\n \n \n80% female. 80%. Now why do you think that is? Could it be because the hours and vacations are compatible with their own children's schedules?\n\n Want to check the stats for librarians? I guess the fact that librarianship is a female-dominated profession means that the hours rock and everyone gets lots of vacation to spend with her kids, huh?\n Seriously what does this have to do with anything? It's not 80% of the females in the country, it's that teaching is a female-dominated profession.\n \n \nHealth benefits? Maternity leaves? Tenure?\n\n Like countless other jobs.\n \n \nPension?\n\n That we pay into the system for as we go. It's not like a free paycheck after we retire.\n \n \nDoesn't the very nature of teaching lend itself to females more so than males?\n\n Look, more random information that Galactababe thinks supports her point.\n \n \nWhile men are not devoid of those qualities, in American society we definitely assign those characteristics more readily to females than to males. Any male deciding to go into teaching must be aware in advance that this is a heavily female dominated profession, always has been and continues to be. It is the ONLY profession where after 3 years, short of the position being eliminated or being the new millennium's Lizzie Borden, a woman's job is secure and guaranteed Step increases in pay, year after year.\n\n Galactababe doesn't seem to recognize the distinction between 80% of a group being women and women being 80% of a group.\n \n \nAs taxpayers, every time our districts put the annual increase of an average of 5-7% on our school taxes up for a vote, we are told, \"It's for the children!\" Baloney! The bulk of the increases go towards health and retirement benefits for the teachers and administrators.\n\n Let's stick to the U.S. as a whole; we've already established that your (caricature of your) district looks bad and isn't representative.\n \n \nI don't buy the whining from teachers about how much work they do after they get in their cars to drive home. Assuming a teacher arrives before the bell rings and stays half an hour after the children leave,\n\n A half hour?! There's a running joke that I live at school. If I get out less than two hours after the students leave, that's a short day.\n \n \nthey are in the workplace for 7 hours. 7 x 182 = 1274 At an average salary of $47,000, that works out to over $36.00 an hour. Not bad.\n\n Like I said, we've already established that your district is not representative. In my state, the average teacher salary isn't nearly $47K, and our contracts are 190 days or more. But really, it's the whole 7-hour day thing that's a joke. Still, it gets better:\n \n \nIn my area, teachers earn upwards of $60 an hour for after school tutoring.\n\n So parents willingly pay $60+/hr for tutoring, but you're whining about $36/hr for mass instruction of 30 students? If parents paid me $2 for each hour of work I spent for their student, I'd be making out like a bandit.\n The bottom line is that while there are things to complain about, public school instruction is one of the cheapest bills you'll have to pay, especially considering the benefit of the result.\n \n \nI have no idea what state electrolyte works in, but even if this practice is considered \"illegal\", I assure you it is widespread.\n\n I didn't deny that it happens. I said that our code of ethics prohibits it. I agree with the prohibition: it would benefit me monetarily to provide sub-par instruction during class so that students would pay me afterward for tutoring. That's incredibly dishonest and should be grounds for dismissal.\n \n \n I can't imagine a single parent who is privately paying a teacher to tutor their child, turning in that teacher to licensing authorities.\n\n I can imagine a parent checking state law and state code of ethics and telling the teacher that it'd be in his/her best interest to stop.\n \n \nParents want what is best for their children and for their children to succeed.\n\n Once again with the \"omg, edumacation is so teh important so we will do wutever it takes (including dish out massive tutoring fees)!\" while the other side of the mouth is saying, \"Damn teachers! They have the gall to ask for reasonable benefits as part of their job which requires ungodly workloads, hellaciously long hours, and the constant berating by whiny people like me who don't know their brain from their XXX end!\"",

   "Surely the cost PER PUPIL should increase as class size reduces, not the overall cost?\n\n \n Actually, both increase. Consider the fact that if a public school where normal class size was 30 students and it now was reduced to 15, you would need 2 teachers to service the same number of students. In my area, we calculate cost per student by dividing the total budget by the number of students in the district. Using this formula, I am in a district that spends over $30,000 per student. \n \n Back to education as a commodity we can compare to ski lessons, you pay more for private instruction than you do for a group lesson. Why? Because you are getting more individualized attention and the teacher's expertise is being imparted to you and you alone. Therefore, it is not necessarily easier for the teacher, just more personal and intense. It is also easier to judge the success or failure of the teacher's methods of teaching based on the improvement/outcome of one individual, as compared to the \"average\" of a group.",

Then, when you go to 15 students per class, you still have your $10 per student ($300), but you have to pay 2 teachers ($600).

I look forward to hearing more from you.\n \n Electrolyte,\n \n I'm glad you are a Chemistry and not an Economics teacher. I had a terrific Chemistry teacher in HS. She was the mother of one of my best friends, such a brilliant woman. She spoke 7 languages fluently, was a concert pianist and had a patent on a waterproofing compound. Back then we were on split sessions, HS ran from 6:45 - 12:15. I spent many afternoons at her home and I honestly don't recall her having mounds of paperwork or dealing with schoolwork at all. She worked around her very large Victorian home. (I still use her chemical reaction tip on how to clean my silver without silver polish!)\n \n I apologize in advance if I don't respond to your dissected posts line by line. No offense, but I knew another poster who handled message boards that way and it was really quite annoying. It reminds me of what the Liberal media does when quoting someone, taking it totally out of context and featuring it as a stand alone sentence. Then I have to go back to my original post to see how that one sentence fit in with the rest of what was said and well, frankly it's just too much trouble.\n \n Bottom line, you could not come up with \"countless\" other professions that offer tenure. In fact, you could not even come up with ONE! Therefore, all of the ridiculous discussion equating babysitters with teachers is just that, ridiculous. In fact, I think it is very sad that the Capt. would use the pay received by an untrained child (who has no pension, health benefits or tenure) as an analogy for attempting to justify increased pay for teachers. It's just lame.\n \n As far as referencing my own district, aren't writers told to write about what they know? I never claimed that the outrageous salaries in my district are representative of the entire nation. But then again, neither are the home prices or general cost of living. Just so you know, I DID run for school board, twice, and lost by a small margin. My district is run by the \"good ol' boys\" network, which means only PTA mommies or individual yes-men handpicked by sitting Board members get in. I was endorsed by the local paper. Scared to death that I might actually win, the BoE President ran around buying up every copy of the paper when it hit the stands. It was quite funny, if you ask me, and I thank God I didn't win because I would have been blamed for everything that went wrong from July 1 forward. Additionally, the votes most likely would have been 6-1, so it would have been a 3 year exercise in futility. \n \n Jo Bennet\n \n You are not recognizing the difference between the public and private sector. Children do not come to class and hand the teacher $2 for the lesson, the teacher's salary is paid by the taxpayers en masse. A teacher acting as a tutor after school hours is operating in the private sector and not bound by union regulations. When the public sector fails to do its job adequately, individuals are often forced to turn to the private sector to obtain the desired results.",

Chester really is.\n \n \nLet's see now, in my area of Colorado, where we have to fully fund our pensions,\n\n \n Au contrare, mon Cappy-tan! How do you sleep at night spewing such blatant lies? Let's look at the following report:\n \n http://www.cboces.org/assets/docs/administrative/hr/PERAFact.pdf\n \n According to the chart within, your EMPLOYER (ie: school district/taxpayers) pays 577M to members 637M. So you contribute roughly 52%. Granted, that's a far cry from the 3% in NYS for 10 years, but wait, what's this?\n \n \nColorado PERA is a defined benefit plan and is a substitute for Social Security for most of these public employees.\n\n \n No FICA taken out of your paycheck? Well, well, well.\n \n http://ednewscolorado.org/other-news/study-teacher-pensions-pose-challenges.html \n \n \nColorado teacher pensions are among the most generous in the nation, and, like pension benefits across the country, are so skewed toward teachers who spend their careers in one state or district that they may contribute to teacher shortages, a new study says.\n\n \n In fact, from Denver, (you are in Denver, right?)\n \n http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/Mar/18/dps-pensions-lopsided/\n \n \nAnd because benefits are based on highest salary earned, the district could end up paying a teacher more for years retired than for years worked.\n\n \n I love how articles like this say the \"district\" ends up paying. The district may write the checks, but the taxpayers are the ones putting the money in the bank.",

   "I'm glad you are a Chemistry and not an Economics teacher.\n\n Me too. Chem rocks. Econ isn't nearly as cool. That said, my point about my pension plan stands. Apparently, chester's works the same way. Perhaps NY's system is the exception instead of the rule.\n \n \nI honestly don't recall her having mounds of paperwork or dealing with schoolwork at all.\n\n Hey, a five-and-a-half hour schoolday is foreign to me, too. I don't know when you were in school, but a lot has changed.\n \n \nI apologize in advance if I don't respond to your dissected posts line by line. No offense, but I knew another poster who handled message boards that way and it was really quite annoying.\n\n I can imagine. Most of the time I end up doing it because the individual statements or points need a response, not because I don't care about the overall point. If someone makes a good point (or bad point, it really doesn't change this effect) but leads into it or backs it up with stupid statements, I rip into the stupid statements.\n \n \nBottom line, you could not come up with \"countless\" other professions that offer tenure. In fact, you could not even come up with ONE!\n\n You know, in my previous post, I admitted that my statement was unclear. I admitted that tenure alone is an academia thing (although post-secondary teachers can get it, too, instead of just public school teachers), but my point was that those individual benefits were common. And they are. That said, you also characterize tenure as having virtually no conditions, which is blatantly false.\n \n \nTherefore, all of the ridiculous discussion equating babysitters with teachers is just that, ridiculous.\n\n I'm equating nothing. I'm comparing and contrasting. I get paid less than a mass babysitter would. When you break it down in that way, the average teacher pay appears appallingly low.\n \n \nIn fact, I think it is very sad that the Capt. would use the pay received by an untrained child (who has no pension, health benefits or tenure) as an analogy for attempting to justify increased pay for teachers.\n\n That's strange, because I think that when you factor in that a teacher has loads more training than the babysitter, also educates the kids, accepts legal responsibility for his/her students well-being -- including the dozens of federal mandates for children with special needs who need special accomodations -- loses income to a pension plan and health coverage, and must meet the requirements of keeping tenure, it's not unreasonable to expect we'd be paid a little better than your average babysitter.\n On the other hand, I don't go around whining about my pay until somebody like you comes on here and tells me that teachers are thieves and that I'm living the good life with a cushy job I don't deserve. You clearly don't realize the magnitude and breadth of work that is involved. This is why your violin belongs where the sun doesn't shine.\n \n \nAs far as referencing my own district, aren't writers told to write about what they know? I never claimed that the outrageous salaries in my district are representative of the entire nation.\n\n But you continue to speak of them as if they are. Let's stick with the averages, or at least the high-percentage range. But anytime you talk about me, I get to use my piddly numbers and make your arguments look even dumber.\n \n \nJust so you know, I DID run for school board, twice, and lost by a small margin. My district is run by the \"good ol' boys\" network, which means only PTA mommies or individual yes-men handpicked by sitting Board members get in. I was endorsed by the local paper.\n\n Glad you tried. If you're not willing to do it again, maybe it's time to team up with the newspaper for op-ed pieces. Gather a bunch of support and have a big ousting to avoid the futile 6-1 efforts.\n \n \n[to Jo]\n A teacher acting as a tutor after school hours is operating in the private sector and not bound by union regulations. When the public sector fails to do its job adequately, individuals are often forced to turn to the private sector to obtain the desired results.\n\n Look, I can tell you only so many times to rock the boat. Check state statutes and codes of ethics. Short of that, try different tutors. I used to tutor for an agency that charged less, and (had I had time between agency gigs and substitute teaching) I had taken steps to do private tutoring for under $20/hr.\n \n Also: Upon reading further, Galactababe's post has reminded me that my district matches my pension contribution (up to a certain percentage, anyway), so the taxpayers do pay part of my pension. So, I'll up and admit that my statement was incorrect. On the other hand, the district gets the interest from that money over that 28+ years plus the time period the pension is drawn. Comparing percentages, I don't think the district (i.e. taxpayer interest) is losing out. (And I still pay social security taxes.)",

You've pointed to some differences between the two types, but those differences suggest that whole class teaching should be paid at a higher rate, not the opposite.\n\n \n It's called the free market and why Marxism doesn't work. Under Marxism, your thinking would apply. In the free world, people pay more for \"exclusive\" instruction. For example, have you ever taken a tennis lesson? A ski lesson? You are going to pay a much higher rate for one on one with a pro than you are if the same pro instructs a group of 15. The pro cannot physically provide the same amount of attention to 15 students as he can with just one. Therefore the quality of the instruction goes up, thereby earning greater value as the number of participants goes down. Same with supply and demand. Not every child in the class of 30 requires tutoring. Some get it just fine with a generalized approach designed to reach many. However, for some students, the broader less personalized approach doesn't work. Teachers can claim they \"differentiate the curriculum\" from now until you know what freezes over, but it's just not happening. Therefore, parents are forced to go \"outside the box\" and hire personalized instruction for their children. Do you understand now?",

It's about relative achievement, not absolute.\n\n \n One thing you should know about me, I am absolutely not a relativist. I totally disagree with your reasoning. In my state, we have standardized state level exams for the major subjects in high school, known as the Regents. The teachers all teach to the test, day after day the vast majority of them drone, \"You have to know this, it will be on the Regents.\" Students must pass at least 7 exams to earn a HS diploma. Parents are very well aware of these exams. What generally happens is by the end of the 2nd quarter, when it is clear that a student is failing or getting D's, when after-school extra-help isn't helping, parents then resort to hiring a tutor.

You used it to falsely accuse me of disagreeing with the majority (as if that's some sort of sin). The truth is that I don't disagree with the majority. How many times do I have to say it?\n But, hey, if you want to pretend that firing a tenured teacher really is impossible and that I'm lying, let's look at the part of the article that says that nearly ONE HUNDRED tenured teachers were dismissed. Do you need me to use smaller words for you? I can even type really slowly if you think it will help... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nI did, and you didn't.\n\n I agreed with Bassman that there should be a better system to ensure teacher accountability. Of course, I don't know how I can possibly convince you of this via an internet forum considering you can't read.\n \n \nBut I did see that you claimed you are not a union member. Do you teach in private school? What state did you say you teach in?\n\n If you'd really read the tread, you'd have seen that I'm not going to give out that information. Anybody who isn't a complete idiot would know why.\n \n \nHow about Open House night? Do you hate that as well? Obviously your claim that parents should be more involved is garbage, you only want the a$$kissers who stroke your fragile ego to be involved.\n\n I like meeting parents. I like knowing what my kids go home to. Parents do very little asskissing, and I'm not there for the purpose of receiving any; instead, I commend the students and try to discuss issues and options with parents when necessary. I have initiated contact with parents countless times, with both good and bad reports. I spent two hours (one of which was past \"closing time\") at my first open house talking to parents of a struggling student trying to find the best approach for her, and there were no accusations or hostility involved. Don't pretend that you know how I communicate with parents in general just because I commented on a particular behavior of some.\n \n \nYou're more concerned with pounding your chest and putting the parents in their place than alleviating their concerns or working together to benefit the student.\n\n Bitch and moan all you want, babe. When a parent comes in fuming because he or she thinks that I've somehow wronged a child, I'll defend myself. And I prevail unless I have wronged that child. Typically, this requires a simple explanation of what occurs in my class. I will not pander to whiny or threatening parents just because they show up and pound their chests with no justification. If you cared to pay any attention, you'd realize that teachers who are pushovers contribute to the problem, not the solution. In other words: if you didn't have your head up your XXX, you'd realize that this isn't something you should be complaining about.\n \n \nDo the students a favor, get out of teaching, now!\n\n I'm serving the students (and the community) well in my position. Students from the previous year have signed up to take my advanced course this year. One (and her parents) wanted me to teach physics so she could have me again. An honor student selected me as her favorite high school teacher, another ranked me second, and several other students have said that I'm one of the best teachers they've ever had. You should have already read about the email from the half-angry parent who essentially said that I did a good job teaching her daughter and preparing her for college and whose only complaint was a good (instead of excellent) grade.\n Now, notice that the only reason that I have previously mentioned the last factoid was because I was making a point about parents and not my teaching. The only reason I'm \"tooting my own horn\" now is because a dipstick like you has insisted that I shouldn't have my job. Now notice that none of this feedback is big-grinned back-slapping from other teachers or administrators; it's not that I don't get great reviews from them, but you seem to think that they're obligated to do that (even though I don't have tenure), so I'll let you focus on the student opinion while you sit and eat your crow.\n \n \nGo back to college and get a degree in chemical engineering so you can spend your days in a laboratory dealing with test tubes and formulas, instead of people. Clearly you have no social skills.\n\n I have plenty of social skills.

Far less chauvinistic.\n \n I am also concerned with how bureaucratic our public education system has become, and how parents' children are used as knives against their throats. \n \n I am open to the idea of tossing tenure. I think teachers' cushy benefits should be taken away, too. Like healthcare. \n \n I question whether Chester The Bald was at Columbia or grew up in the Binghamton, New York slums.

She didn't get along with his mother and blamed everything on this poor woman, who she referred to as too \"uppity\", talking down about how she was black and a single mother, and one final meeting they had where the mother couldn't take her anymore and walked out. Whereupon, the son's education in this high school ended prematurely. She didn't seem to be able to reflect on how she communicated anything to this parent. Nor did she appear to have any remorse and concern for what happened to this student. She just made all kinds of excuses for herself and didn't take any responsibility. She flippantly stated they likely left town afterwards and his life was ruined in the big city. She didn't remember his name enough to follow up.

One reason, besides Iraq, I'm going with Obama, even though I like McCain personally. But they need to secure the borders in either case (health or education). As Mexico, especially, doesn't provide sufficiently there for its citizens. \n \n Maybe the teachers would work harder if they hired illegal immigrants to do their jobs?\n \n I haven't been an easy sell on Obama. Mostly because of some things I've seen in his campaign. The turning point, for me, however, his recent international appearances. I think he will restore our badly damaged prestige abroad, and likewise, this shall give the economy a boost. But I now digress. And I am not an economist.",

You've criticized the amount of time that I spend working as a \"time management\" problem. You've accused me of lying about how much time I spend doing school-related work. You've accused me of hating parents who don't kiss XXX. You've accused me of unquestioningly supporting dogmatic adherence to a system that I've said needs work. You've accused me of undeservingly taking advantage of systems that are not even in place in my state. You've accused me of lying about the termination of a tenured employee.

I'm confused because -- though you have no training, very little knowledge of the applicable laws, and no education about teaching -- you claim to have all of the answers, which amount to \"Fire those teachers.\" I'm confused because I don't understand how somebody who claims to be a voice of educated reason can be saying things so utterly unsupported.\n \n If you're not going to eat your crow, Ms. High Road, I urge you to seek a muzzle, at least until you can say things that aren't idiotic.",

A student-student problem? A teacher-student problem? A lack of learning? No, she chooses declining grades. The vast majority of parents are concerned mostly with grades. A teacher whose students all receive As or Bs often gets glowing reviews from students and parents, even if the reason for the As and Bs is a woeful lack of challenging -- and therefore highly effective -- instruction.\n \n Now, I'm not trying to imply that antonia is a bad parent, or that she doesn't care so much about the actual learning. (In fact, her later comment shows that she does.) And it is easy to understand why parents are so concerned about grades; there are placement and scholarship issues at stake, and these affect both instruction quality and the pocketbook. Let's face it: both of these are worthy of concern. But grades are not directly indicative of learning; they are only indicative of performance. It is student learning, not relative student performance, that is the goal of teaching.\n \n \nBut there is not one bit of doubt in my mind that they are concerned parents.\n\n It's good to have concerned parents. I don't have a problem with parents who are concerned. I have a problem with parents who think that they know better than I do what their child should be studying, or be assigned, or receive as a grade. I have a problem with parents who are enablers, parents who think that any problem must be the fault of anybody besides their child(ren), parents who immediately and unquestioningly regard a teacher as deserving of uninformed criticism without having set foot in the classroom. I can't tell you exactly how many times I've invited parents to sit in on my class, but I can count on zero hands how many times any of them have taken me up on that offer.\n So, antonia, when people like you and Ms. High Road run your mouths about how I must be doing my students and community a huge disservice because you don't like the way I defend myself against your belligerent denigration, I'll invite you to take a nice, long walk off of a disturbingly short pier, and I won't feel the slightest bit bad about it, either.

I think there are only a handful of universities which would consider admitting a student based on portfolio alone. \n \n I remember in elementary school when students received \"grades\" of either E (Excellent), G (Good), S (Satisfactory) or U (Unsatisfactory). And while these appear much more nebulous and subjective, as small as the children were, there was still report card comparing going on. \"I got all E's!\" or \"Why did I get an S in handwriting?\" \n \n The world is competitive, and earning a high GPA is evidence of having completed the course-work in an exemplary manner in addition to evidence of learning. The problem is many teachers use grade inflation to make it look like their classes are doing better than they really are. I'm sure you've heard your kids hoping to get a certain teacher because he/she is an \"easy marker\". This works well up until 10th grade, when all of a sudden there are standardized exams for the taking which compare your child's knowledge base with every other child in the country.",

I was class mother, site-based team member, founded and chaired an elementary science fair, VP of SEPTA, sat on many hiring committees, regularly attended Board meetings and even reported on education for the local paper. I lost the Board election because I have the support of people who have degrees from Brown and Yale and not the support of people who have HS diplomas and care only about sports. In my neck of the woods, the athletic director is also known as God. If the HS is changing its academic curriculum, a handful of parents come to the Board meeting. But if a football coach gets fired?

There was no copyright on the ditto, nor could I tell where it came from. During the teacher's presentation on Open House night, I brought the ditto with me. When she got to science, I asked her if she could please tell me the source of the ditto. She got all flustered and told me to wait until the end of the presentation. I waited, let a few other parents ask questions, then I raised my hand and asked her again. She turned beet red and stammered, \"It's from the Museum of Natural History, ok?\" The bell rang, I left, next thing I hear the woman was crying hysterically. Wanna know what the school did? They threw my daughter, who never had a discipline issue a day in her life, out of her class! They put her with another \"team\" of teachers because they \"couldn't teach a cynical child who had a cynical mother like me.\" But first they made her sit through a special video of all the special things that the \"team\" she was thrown off of would be doing, that she wouldn't get to do.

You're more concerned with pounding your chest and putting the parents in their place than alleviating their concerns or working together to benefit the student.\n\n I like meeting parents. I like knowing what my kids go home to. Parents do very little asskissing, and I'm not there for the purpose of receiving any; instead, I commend the students and try to discuss issues and options with parents when necessary. I have initiated contact with parents countless times, with both good and bad reports. I spent two hours (one of which was past \"closing time\") at my first open house talking to parents of a struggling student trying to find the best approach for her, and there were no accusations or hostility involved.

If you remember what I said earlier in the thread, you know that I advocate that teachers have excellent understanding of the subjects they teach instead of rudimentary knowledge and whatever happens to be in their teacher's edition. Freshman level astronomy pretty much takes care of this claim.\n That said, I've used worksheets/handouts from a colleague or supplement that I had to explain to the kids aren't the way I'd make them because I deemed \"time saver + correction\" better than \"incomplete\"; I simply didn't have time to make something perfect and complete.\n \n \n... next thing I hear the woman was crying hysterically.\n\n I'm told that this is common, especially for new teachers.

   "Antonia:\n \n You know someone who was accepted to MIT based entirely on portfolio assessment? Really? No SAT or ACT? No independent AP exams? I'm stunned. Are you sure they didn't graduate MIT and transfer in from another university? It's just I am familiar with MIT's admission requirements and I find that really hard to believe. \n \n I agree you can put a lot on a CD nowadays. So riddle me this. Your child is ready to move up from 8th to 9th grade. Who is going to look over all of the scanned documentation on that CD to determine which level of courses your child is best suited for? Who selected which pieces of work were the \"best\" representation of your child's work? What if the person reviewing the portfolio simply doesn't like your child's writing style? Surely you don't expect the Guidance Office to handle all of these things. No offense to Guidance Counselors, but the number of really good ones are few and far between. GC's are often assigned over 150 students each. Counting on these individuals to determine your child's HS courseload is not a good idea. Counting on these individuals to recommend which college is best for your child is not a good idea either. No one knows your child better than you do, and without grades to use as a benchmark, it is impossible to advocate for your child's placement in a higher level course. Portfolios are entirely subjective. \n \n Even \"authentic assessment\" (evaluation of \"hands-on learning\") uses a rubric to assess the student's progress resulting in a grade: http://jonathan.mueller.faculty.noctrl.edu/toolbox/whatisit.htm\n \n Of course we don't want our children taking courses just because there is a State final at the end of the course. NY's Regents exams and southern states which use the SOL's may be among the minority in the nation. I don't know offhand if Idaho, North Dakota or Colorado have state exams, maybe Cappy can fill us in on that. Then again, NY probably has among the highest percentage of students in the nation going on to university because of its state requirements. But I am still of the opinion that universities, parents and the students themselves need grades as a measure of affirmation of achievement.\n \n Electrolyte:\n \n I apologize, you did respond to my Open House question. And look at that, we ended up agreeing on a few things. \n \n Rest assured, after my daughter came home very upset that Friday after being forced to view that video, (yes during instructional time), the following Monday I called the Asst. Principal. I said, \"So, Mrs. X, why don't you tell me how carefully and tactfully you handled my daughter's transition to the other team?\" \"Ohhh, we did, of course, blah, blah, blah....\". Then I let her have it. I said, \"What did you people do? Go to the Marquis de Sade school of compassion? Do not EVER speak to me or my child about Character Education again!\"\n \n Middle schools are the worst idea ever invented. Sixth graders are being denied the opportunity to be the \"big cheeses\" they once were in elementary schools and are scared and intimidated by the 7th and 8th graders. One of the biggest problems is teacher certification. In NYS, teachers are licensed to teach K-6 or 5-12. (the 5-12 appears to be a 2003 revision to accommodate the growth of the MS concept, I am pretty sure it used to be 7-12) You could have a 6th grade teacher in a MS who can't be moved around to teach upper grades, or if 2 or 3 of them go out on maternity leave, you are faced with having to fill a very difficult slot. If I had my druthers, I'd go back to the old Jr. High/HS structure. It made a lot more sense. Even the state guidelines for after-school sports activities are different for 6th grade than for the upper grades. Making kids grow up faster than they are ready by pushing them into an older environment is part of the reason many MS students are engaging in sex and drugs at age 11, or even 10 in the case of MS's that start in 5th Grade. And of course, I can only speak for my district, but when students entered middle school, gone are the days of chaperoning class trips. Gone are the days of class parents or even any sort of feeling of welcoming of parents by the school. I attended one PTA meeting where a parent asked why we were no longer allowed to be chaperones and the administrator actually said, \"Because children of this age are embarrassed by their parents.\" Hello? Maybe they weren't embarrassed by us until you TOLD them they were embarrassed by us. Gone are the Friday folders with notices and information. Communication in general came to a grinding halt. Parents were advised that if they had a problem or a question, they should communicate it to the teacher via e-mail. In some cases this worked fine. In some cases, e-mail is simply NOT the way to handle a problem.",

Are you sure they didn't graduate MIT and transfer in from another university? It's just I am familiar with MIT's admission requirements and I find that really hard to believe. \n \n I agree you can put a lot on a CD nowadays. So riddle me this. Your child is ready to move up from 8th to 9th grade. Who is going to look over all of the scanned documentation on that CD to determine which level of courses your child is best suited for? Who selected which pieces of work were the \"best\" representation of your child's work? What if the person reviewing the portfolio simply doesn't like your child's writing style? Surely you don't expect the Guidance Office to handle all of these things. No offense to Guidance Counselors, but the number of really good ones are few and far between. GC's are often assigned over 150 students each. Counting on these individuals to determine your child's HS courseload is not a good idea. Counting on these individuals to recommend which college is best for your child is not a good idea either. No one knows your child better than you do, and without grades to use as a benchmark, it is impossible to advocate for your child's placement in a higher level course. Portfolios are entirely subjective. \n \n Even \"authentic assessment\" (evaluation of \"hands-on learning\") uses a rubric to assess the student's progress resulting in a grade: http://jonathan.mueller.faculty.noctrl.edu/toolbox/whatisit.htm\n \n Of course we don't want our children taking courses just because there is a State final at the end of the course. NY's Regents exams and southern states which use the SOL's may be among the minority in the nation. I don't know offhand if Idaho, North Dakota or Colorado have state exams, maybe Cappy can fill us in on that. Then again, NY probably has among the highest percentage of students in the nation going on to university because of its state requirements. But I am still of the opinion that universities, parents and the students themselves need grades as a measure of affirmation of achievement.\n \n Electrolyte:\n \n I apologize, you did respond to my Open House question. And look at that, we ended up agreeing on a few things. \n \n Rest assured, after my daughter came home very upset that Friday after being forced to view that video, (yes during instructional time), the following Monday I called the Asst. Principal. I said, \"So, Mrs. X, why don't you tell me how carefully and tactfully you handled my daughter's transition to the other team?\" \"Ohhh, we did, of course, blah, blah, blah....\". Then I let her have it. I said, \"What did you people do? Go to the Marquis de Sade school of compassion? Do not EVER speak to me or my child about Character Education again!\"\n \n Middle schools are the worst idea ever invented. Sixth graders are being denied the opportunity to be the \"big cheeses\" they once were in elementary schools and are scared and intimidated by the 7th and 8th graders. One of the biggest problems is teacher certification. In NYS, teachers are licensed to teach K-6 or 5-12. (the 5-12 appears to be a 2003 revision to accommodate the growth of the MS concept, I am pretty sure it used to be 7-12) You could have a 6th grade teacher in a MS who can't be moved around to teach upper grades, or if 2 or 3 of them go out on maternity leave, you are faced with having to fill a very difficult slot. If I had my druthers, I'd go back to the old Jr. High/HS structure. It made a lot more sense. Even the state guidelines for after-school sports activities are different for 6th grade than for the upper grades. Making kids grow up faster than they are ready by pushing them into an older environment is part of the reason many MS students are engaging in sex and drugs at age 11, or even 10 in the case of MS's that start in 5th Grade. And of course, I can only speak for my district, but when students entered middle school, gone are the days of chaperoning class trips. Gone are the days of class parents or even any sort of feeling of welcoming of parents by the school. I attended one PTA meeting where a parent asked why we were no longer allowed to be chaperones and the administrator actually said, \"Because children of this age are embarrassed by their parents.\" Hello? Maybe they weren't embarrassed by us until you TOLD them they were embarrassed by us. Gone are the Friday folders with notices and information. Communication in general came to a grinding halt. Parents were advised that if they had a problem or a question, they should communicate it to the teacher via e-mail. In some cases this worked fine. In some cases, e-mail is simply NOT the way to handle a problem.\n\n \n Could not agree more about the horror called Middle School. I was teaching in NYS when the transition was made from Junior High to Middle School.\n \n Here in Denver, the trend is returning to K-8 schools and then a 4-year High School.\n \n So far, it's too early to see the outcome, but I cannot help but think tht the presence of the little ones will tame the rowdiness of the early teen years.",

Reducing motivation to \"It'll help you on the college entrance exam that you'll never take!\" or \"One day, you'll be on a game show about world history!\" doesn't work.

Communication from the school to home virtually stops unless your child gets detention or the school wants money for something.\n\n Gee, Ms. High Road, I didn't \"conveniently ignore\" anything. Let's go through these again:\n We've discussed email. It's the best way to communicate with parents. I use it all the time. Students can't fail to give it to a parent, intercept it in the mailbox, or delete it from an answering machine. Phone tag is pointless. But no teacher has time to go through his or her roster and fire off specific emails to parents about how their child is doing. (Surely I have nothing better to do with my non-instructional time than spend five minutes crafting a nice email for each of my 150 students once each week, right?) It sometimes takes me a day or even two to find time to reply to a parent's email with something more substantial and informative than generic and unhelpful. We don't know what Parent A considers noteworthy and how that differs from Parent B's opinion. Why should I bust my hump (even more than usual) to send 150 emails when most of them will be essentially ignored? As a parent, you can ask me what's going on and to notify you in the event that x, y, or z occurs. But by the time your kid is high school age, responsibility needs to be shifting to him or her.\n \n \nHow dare you broadly label all parents as \"caring less\" once their kids reach the tween years, that is simply ridiculous, arrogant and presumptuous on your part.\n\n But I didn't, Ms. High Road. I said that parents \"tend\" to be less involved, and I mentioned a difference according to socioeconomic status. That's two pieces of evidence that I didn't even imply that I labeled all parents as \"less involved,\" let alone caring less which is a phrase you introduced.\n Once again: Please learn how to read.\n I can only wonder how terribly off-kilter your persecution complex is when you see \"less involved\" and think \"caring less.\" If these high school students are young adults, then they need to start being independent of mommy and daddy in some aspects of their lives. If they misbehave at school, they should face consequences at school, and mommy and daddy should be upset that the student didn't fess up (oh yeah, and misbehaved in the first place).\n My turn for an anecdote. A student's parents requested two conferences with their son's teachers, of whom I was one. The mother turned out to be the worst kind of enabler, with veteran teachers walking out of the meeting. When I had my next problem with this student, I wrote an email putting all the ducks in a nice, neat row and sent it to the parents. I didn't hear back. Nor did his counselor or assistant principal. At that point I began bypassing the parents. And you can be damn sure I was justified in doing so. We dealt with everything schoolside, and it was clear that this was the only way anything would happen.",

Remember, though, we really don't want them here.\" \"Parent-Teacher Conferences are this Monday; please take home these scheduling forms. But, children, make sure your parents know that they're not actually supposed to show up.\" And this makes kids embarrassed by their parents, but only while at school, huh? I bet you never heard your son plead \"Mo-om!\" while he was a tween and around other people, too.\n\n \n The idiocy is all yours. I am not referring to scheduled meetings that are on a district calendar. I am referring to things like chaperoning school field trips, helping out on field day, welcoming parents to special in-school assemblies, inviting a parent who works in a subject related field to be a guest speaker, etc., etc. I certainly can't say the following pertains to all districts, but in my own district, administration has gotten into a nasty little habit of giving parents who volunteer to participate on hiring committees less than 24 hours notice for a meeting! How about a little common courtesy? \n \n As to your moaning about sending out e-mails to 150 students, I'll tell you what one of my daughter's best teachers did. This teacher taught Living Environment. He had his own webpage and every week he sent out an e-mail to the parents of all of his students explaining what would be covered in the upcoming week. If my daughter happened to do something exceptional or funny in class, he'd dash off a quick, 2 line note to me to let me know. Some parents thought he was \"sarcastic\" and \"too full of himself\". I thought he had a great sense of humor, was dedicated, educated and concerned. \n \n One of the other best teachers that my son had taught 7th grade science. His rules were strict. The students had to sign a contract at the beginning of the year. (this was in the early 90's, before everyone had e-mail). The first month in his class, my son used to come home white-knuckled. But he learned. And he did what the teacher expected of him because he wanted to prove to the teacher that he could. One day, the teacher sent home a permission slip for a field trip to a science museum. Attached to the slip was an explanation of how the trip tied to the curriculum. I was in awe. This was the first time I had ever received such an explanation. So I wrote back, \"Thank you so much for explaining how this ties to what he is learning.\" Wanna know what he wrote back? \"Thank you so much for your note. You are the first parent to ever thank me for the explanation.\" He wore a t-shirt and jeans to school and drove his Harley on nice days, taught for 32 years and hardly ever missed a day. He retired before my daughter had the privilege of having him as a teacher, but he would come in to school on occasion, without pay, just to pop in and help out. \n \n I believe what these teachers did on a daily basis is known in educationese as \"best practices\", except they turned those practices into mastery.",

How about a little common courtesy?\n\n You're right; that doesn't apply to all districts. Parents don't sit on our hiring committees. Our committee specifically asks questions about parental involvement, because experienced teachers and administrators have a better knowledge base about it than a single parent.\n \n \nAs to your moaning about sending out e-mails to 150 students, I'll tell you what one of my daughter's best teachers did. ... Some parents thought he was \"sarcastic\" and \"too full of himself\".\n\n 1) I do occasionally fire off quick emails to parents just to report something good.\n 2) You acknowledge that this thing that I've now mentioned twice is a problem: Some parents don't want notes like those because they find the notes a nuisance, so I don't send them off to just any parent. The only way I have a parent email address is if it is either given to me or sent to me from that address, which means that the parent does want feedback. Those parents get the occasional blurb. At the same time, emailing Hannah's mother every time she gets an A on an exam becomes a nuisance if Hannah gets As so often that it's uneventful.\n \n \n... His rules were strict.

I'll be the first to admit that I haven't mastered anything, but it was my understanding that these sorts of things aren't just \"best practices,\" they're standard practices.\n But, I have to admit that I don't wear a t-shirt and jeans... we have a dress code.",

   "Antonia:\n \n \nWhat is it about the mentioned government programs that lead to such problems?\n\n \n A number of things. First, let me state that I fully support assistance for the physically/mentally disabled who are unable to function in society. As a civilized nation, we should do what we can to make their time on this earth comfortable. That said, for the able-bodied and the teachable, having a nanny government enables laziness, encourages \"beating the system\" and circumventing the taxes paid by people who DO work hard and pay their taxes which go to support the indigents. \n \n For example, take foster care. Now many foster care parents are very good people with very big hearts. But not all. There are constantly stories in the news about foster care parents who take in more children than they can care for properly, just to collect the extra money per child. Even sadder is that the State pays a higher amount if you take a child with disabilities. If all people spent the money awarded by the State entirely on the children, the system would be fine. But they don't, and there is a lack of follow-up by the State agencies to insure the children are properly cared for. The same goes for CPS. We just had a terrible case where a mother murdered her 3 children. Had CPS been called? Numerous times. The day before she murdered them, in fact. But the mother didn't answer the door when the CPS worker stopped by, it was a Friday, no one checked back, so along came the weekend. The false security provided to .gov workers that their job and social responsibilities end at 4:30, that their pensions are being padded, and that they can go home to their own families with little risk of losing their jobs (especially if they have seniority or are tenured) despite woeful performance leads to a broken system and a broken society. \n \n \nCondi Rice mentioned recently (at least I think it was her), that we perhaps don't appreciate what the impact of slavery can be on a population in a given society. \n\n \n Condi said that? Geez. Well you know what? I guess she's right. So if all of the African-American brothers and sisters in this country are so upset about their great-great-great ancestors being brought over to this country, then let them freely move to modern day Africa. Hell, I'll help pay their passage. Frankly, I think they should be kissing American soil and saying, \"Hey, you know what? This turned out okay. We have a lot more opportunity here than we would in Ethiopia.\"\n \n I'm sure Cappy is a teacher. A poster in another forum sent books out to his school. But Electrolyte? He won't even say what state he is in or if he teaches in private or public school. If there's no teacher's union and he is a legitimate teacher, then he is probably in private school which means he doesn't have to deal with students with disabilities. Good thing. His defensive posturing and extreme insecurity makes me believe he probably is a teacher, just a very young one.",

   "Galactababe,\n \n We live in a great country, do we not. We have made it through terrible institutions like slavery, wars, genocides, economic upheavals like the Great Depression, natural disasters .. and still, we rise ... I think we may go much further as a people, if we keep working at it. After all, how are African Americans, unable to emigrate from the inner city, going to emigrate to Africa? Plus, I love my country, I protest its conditions, at times feeling like her dispossessed child, but I do not think I could return to the land of any of my various ancestors. Indeed, many of those places, even as nations, no longer exist.\n \n Did Chester acknowledge receiving these books? I do wonder about a teacher who announces his present district about the internet, but is reluctant to say where he taught in NY. Just innuendos of greatness: NYC suburbs. Well, some of those districts are great, but some, terrible. He does not sound to me like a teacher from one of the better places.\n \n Aren't public schools down south non-unionized? Perhaps Electrolyte, if really in teaching, is thereabouts. He does sound like he could be a newer teacher. They can gripe on and on about parents, without any understanding of where the parents are coming from.\n \n Both, however, engage in what I see in our public schools as the rampant infliction of 'the pedagogy of stupid.' If a teacher simply tells students they are stupid, in any myriad of ways, that will control the classroom and get them through their day.\n \n Is it any wonder that so many students are falling through the cracks?",

   "Antonia:\n \n As you say, as a nation, we continue to rise. Let's not forget that African-American males were given the right to vote and protection of Due Process under the 14th Amendment in 1868, a solid 52 years before all women earned the right to vote under the 19th Amendment in 1920. In the historical sense, women were considered chattel for more than half a century longer than black males. As a nation, we \"evolved\" in terms of civil rights in the 60's. We have bent over backwards as a nation in terms of affirmative action, grants and scholarships to advance African-Americans. Many have taken advantage of the initiatives offered to pull themselves out of the ghettos and take their rightful place in society landing excellent jobs and attaining great wealth. Many have not. When powerful black women like Condi Rice make an offhand remark that \"perhaps we don't appreciate what the impact of slavery can be on a population in a given society\", it makes my blood boil. Get over it. Stop playing the victim. She didn't get to where she is without all of the reforms this country has made since 1963. Why are African-Americans the ethnicity with the most cases of HIV? Why are African-Americans the largest population in prisons? Why do African-Americans score the lowest on standardized exams? Why are there more African-Americans on welfare than whites? The protective laws, rights, opportunities and advantages are all in place for African-Americans. Slavery, other than in the history books, is not even a memory for living African-Americans. My point about encouraging griping African-Americans to go back to Africa was tongue in cheek, but a point, nonetheless. If their ancestors hadn't been brought over here in chains, they would likely be growing up in a 3rd world African nation, still suffering from HIV but with Ebola and typhoid to boot, poor educational opportunities and constant strife and poverty. Since the days of slavery in our country, the Irish have been oppressed, Jews have been oppressed, in my Village, there were even property deeds that prohibited homes from being sold to Italians! \n \n In order to eliminate the stereotypes that surround African-Americans, many need to stop replicating the behaviors that produced those stereotypes in the first place and blaming slavery. I have a brother-in-law who is black. Uncle Larry is the best, my kids adore him and he is a part of our family. He doesn't call himself or his brothers and sisters the N-word, he is a law abiding citizen and has worked hard all his life. He votes. One thing I've always told my kids, \"A-holes come in all colors and from all ethnicities, never judge someone by their appearance.\" \n \n (even bald men appeal to some women - emoticon_xhoho )",

You stated that there is a tie between socioeconomic status and less involvement by parents. I said that is a gross generalization, a presumption, a stereotype, to which you went off on a rant about correlation and causation, instead of supplying even one link to a report to support your opinion. As it happens, there are a number of studies which have come to different conclusions regarding the effect of parental involvement, especially regarding student achievement in math and science. Here is one from the UK that you might want to look over:\n \n http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/research/data/uploadfiles/RR433.pdf\n \n Educators, particularly those in lower SES districts (those with a higher percentage of free/reduced lunch) are quick to blame lower SES for lower achievement on standardized exams, especially math. Most parents, regardless of SES, are not familiar with the \"new math\" and therefore are not of any help at home. I know I wasn't. Parents in the upper SES category can afford to hire private tutors. The disconnect between what children are being taught in the classroom today and what parents were taught when they went to school is the cause. The ability of wealthier parents to hire private remediation gets reflected in the results. If both the lower and higher SES parents understood what was being taught in math, then parental attitude in the home, not socioeconomics, becomes more important. I'm going to go out on a limb here and take a guess that your \"professional development\" on the issue of parental involvement and socioeconomics was based entirely on the 2002 Sacker study. \n \n The study I linked shows that when one factors out socioeconomic status, parental attitudes in the home towards education are of far greater impact on student achievement than parental involvement in school. \n \n \nThe only points you've \"won\" over the course of this discussion were whether I posted a statement in this thread or another one and whether you reversed the order of my statements.\n\n \n I won those did I?

The fact is that SES and parental attitudes are not uncorrelated. Let's see if I can help you with the four-year old activity of connect the dots: Socioeconomic level and positive parental attitudes toward school are positively correlated. Positive parental attitudes and high student achievement are positively correlated. Now, think back to what I said about correlation between SES and achievement not being causal. It all makes sense if your head isn't up your XXX.\n \n \nIt was ridiculous that I even had to waste my time proving that you are the one repeatedly making false accusations about my reading ability...\n\n See above, where you've presented \"counterarguments\" to arguments I haven't made.\n \n \nI stand by my statement that once students reach MS, administration and teachers foster an attitude of pushing parents away and reducing communication, regardless of socioeconomic status. It is impossible for parents to foster greater respect and desire to achieve at home, if they are left in the dark about what is taking place in school.\n\n Of course you stand by it.

Open Houses, Parent-Teacher conferences, PTA meetings, publication of teacher email addresses... they're all just window dressing where schools invite parents to communicate with teachers so that the parents don't know that we don't want to communicate with them. Websites now have special user-scanner interfaces that magically block parents from viewing school information or student grades, too, which means that when a parent emails me to ask about a grade they've checked online, that parent must have hacked the magical parent filters. (Obviously, I immediately turn said parents in to the authorities for savage beatings and torturous interrogations.)\n Seriously, I think it takes some sort of mental defect to see all of this and still think that schools are trying to push parents away.",

Whoopdedoo. \n \n Parent Plus loans are available to anyone with good credit, regardless of income. \n \n Merit scholarships from universities and scholarships from external organizations are really key for middle class families. When it came time to decide which university to commit to, we sat down and weighed the different offerings from the schools. It is a misnomer that you can negotiate with the financial aid departments of universities for bigger awards. I DID look into it, there IS an appeal process, but the feeling I got in speaking to counselors was that it was a risky road to take and the major private universities flat out say they don't consider offers from other schools. It is also a good idea for your student to sign up for work-study. What I have seen happen at both the State and private schools, especially for Freshman year, is that the schools end up giving a credit for work-study hours as long as the student made themselves available, even if the students aren't placed in a job. Every little bit helps.\n \n We attended a family party yesterday and my niece is so excited because she just landed a job as a 6th grade Social Studies teacher in the Bronx. Every boy in her class will absolutely be in love with her, she is stunning. Anyway, she was very cute because the one thing she was happiest about? There are no State assessments for 6th grade.....LOL! It's a public school which specializes in mathematics, so her lessons have to integrate math into them. She had attended SUNY New Paltz mostly on scholarships, and earned her Masters at Adelphi. One of her scholarships was actually for HomeComing Queen! Who knew there were scholarships for that?",

I do hope you took her to task for her happiness that, \"There are no State assessments for 6th grade.\"\n \n Sounds like she will be using authentic assessments.\n \n The integration of math into Social; Studies, and Social Studies into math is important.\n \n One of the concepts that teachers in general need to understand is that there is a unity of skills that is needed across the curriculum. If the necessary reading and writing skills are taught across the curriculum, it will be far easier for students to write book reports, history essays, lab reports, and the like and to decipher math word problems.\n \n BTW, there are scholarships for all kinds of things you might not expect. Back in the day, I won one from the Elks Club. My youngest won money from the Sons of Italy Scholarship program (other ethnic groups have their own) and another one for being Strawberry Queen in her town.\n \n I also had a student years ago who won a full ride to the University of Michigan from the Daughters of the Confederacy since he was a direct lineal descendant of a Southern general in the War of Southern Treason - 1860-5. \n \n I love irony involved.

That teacher having web articles about themselves from newspapers. So, feigned offense that anyone might reveal his true identity (like blowing wind up Marilyn's skirt?) when inquiring which NYC suburban district he taught at, seems awfully silly. IMO, if they were this teacher, they should just go on as themselves and discuss education politely and like a grown-up. Either the teacher is not a grown-up, or someone else is pretending to be that teacher, retiring from their long career. Of course, if the teacher is now chronically stupid from their 40 years in the public school system, it's not surprising that, when faced with normal and intelligent observations about others, and from a random sample of the adult population (instead -- that is, those long gone from their 'classrooms' and now free to think for themselves, having functional reading comprehension and retention), they'd run in fear and trembling.\n \n Either way, though, the poster is rude and chauvinistic. A good stomper for the Republicans come November. Just keep letting him out there, along with some others he keeps good company with, and they'll make the conservatives look like they're only ones who make sense or know anything about respect or common courtesy. Sad as it is for me to make this observation, it is true, Democrats so often do themselves in. \n \n But I digress. Kudos to your niece.",

You might want to see a doctor about that. You know, I've read that high levels of testosterone increase early baldness in men. \n \n antonia \n \n The state with the lowest \"average\" teacher's salary is South Dakota, coming in at $34,039 in 2004-5. http://www.aft.org/presscenter/releases/2007/statereleases/SalarySurvey-SD.pdf\n Four years later, we can safely guess that number is closer to $37,000. In Sioux Falls, one can purchase an absolutely adorable starter home at foreclosure for $46,000: http://www.tenmanagement.com/listings/property-detail.do?code=SD&list=2008-07-25&case=471-097224\n On a single income, a young family where one parent is a teacher can still afford to buy a home. RE taxes are well under $1,000 a year.\n \n In my district where the \"average\" teacher's salary is in the $85,000 range, an adorable starter home, even in foreclosure, goes for around $350,000. Using the age-old formula of multiplying gross income x 2 1/2 + down payment, a single teacher would qualify for a $215,000 mortgage. RE taxes are in the $7-8,000 a year range for a comparable house. So here on Long Island, both adults would need to work to purchase a home.\n \n Anyone who reads the news knows that real estate prices across the entire country pretty much peaked in 2005 and that we are seeing a major adjustment. But have teacher incomes peaked? Not at all. Tenured teachers are guaranteed their Step increases every year. I am just sick and tired of whining crybabies like Chester and Electrolyte who think they are so undervalued and under-appreciated. Bottom line, if you attend an Ivy League school and use that education to only rise to the level of K-12 teacher and choose to live and teach in a more depressed area of the country, then you should be in it because you love to teach, not for the false expectations of ever earning a salary or prestige similar to a surgeon or a lawyer. \n \n Nowadays, the cost of a Columbia degree is close to $200,000. While that may not make much of a dent in the pockets of some families, to others it amounts to taking on a huge debt for the \"value\" of having a degree from Columbia. It is recognized, just like Harvard, and in many professions, provides access to job opportunities with six figure starting salaries. Teaching isn't one of those. Had Chester gone on to earn his Ph.D. or Ed.D. and administrative certificate, he could have been earning upwards of $200,000 a year easily. The Superintendent of one district here on LI makes over $400,000 plus benefits! That's more than the President of the United States!\n \n \nTraditionally, the president is the highest-paid public employee. President Bush currently earns $400,000 per year, along with a $50,000 expense account, a $100,000 nontaxable travel account, and $19,000 for entertainment.[2] The president's salary and total expense account serve as an unofficial cap for all other federal officials' salaries ~Wikipedia\n\n \n \n Kind of puts everything in perspective, no?",

   "Galactababe,\n \n \n I could go back through this thread and individually list the number of times you have pounded your chest and blathered how you have:\n \n ~ kicked the asses of\n ~ crushed\n ~ destroyed\n ~ trounced\n ~ won against\n ~ thrashed \n\n \n Apparently, for Electrolyte, board debate is like television wrestling. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nThe state with the lowest \"average\" teacher's salary is South Dakota, coming in at $34,039 in 2004-5. http://www.aft.org/presscenter/releases/2007/statereleases/SalarySurvey-SD.pdf\n Four years later, we can safely guess that number is closer to $37,000. In Sioux Falls, one can purchase an absolutely adorable starter home at foreclosure for $46,000: http://www.tenmanagement.com/listings/property-detail.do?code=SD&list=2008-07-25&case=471-097224\n On a single income, a young family where one parent is a teacher can still afford to buy a home. RE taxes are well under $1,000 a year.\n \n In my district where the \"average\" teacher's salary is in the $85,000 range, an adorable starter home, even in foreclosure, goes for around $350,000. Using the age-old formula of multiplying gross income x 2 1/2 + down payment, a single teacher would qualify for a $215,000 mortgage. RE taxes are in the $7-8,000 a year range for a comparable house. So here on Long Island, both adults would need to work to purchase a home.\n \n Anyone who reads the news knows that real estate prices across the entire country pretty much peaked in 2005 and that we are seeing a major adjustment. But have teacher incomes peaked? Not at all. Tenured teachers are guaranteed their Step increases every year. I am just sick and tired of whining crybabies like Chester and Electrolyte who think they are so undervalued and under-appreciated. Bottom line, if you attend an Ivy League school and use that education to only rise to the level of K-12 teacher and choose to live and teach in a more depressed area of the country, then you should be in it because you love to teach, not for the false expectations of ever earning a salary or prestige similar to a surgeon or a lawyer. \n \n Nowadays, the cost of a Columbia degree is close to $200,000. While that may not make much of a dent in the pockets of some families, to others it amounts to taking on a huge debt for the \"value\" of having a degree from Columbia. It is recognized, just like Harvard, and in many professions, provides access to job opportunities with six figure starting salaries. Teaching isn't one of those. Had Chester gone on to earn his Ph.D. or Ed.D. and administrative certificate, he could have been earning upwards of $200,000 a year easily. The Superintendent of one district here on LI makes over $400,000 plus benefits! That's more than the President of the United States!\n \n Kind of puts everything in perspective, no?\n\n \n Yes, I'm inclined to agree with your perspective. Certainly Electrolyte's board behavior is not any kind reflection on the profession, either. Whatever he *says* goes on in his classroom. That we are supposed to accept verbatim from his venomous lips.\n \n I would not go for raises, I would throw health benefits out of the door. I would give some classrooms more aides, that's it. Although I suggested earlier giving NYC teachers housing assistance, I seem to recollect reading that they are getting big raises in some areas. So that should put them in the same ballpark as the rest of the city. \n \n That Superintendent salary seems indecent to me. What do they do with their days, anyway?",

   "antonia:\n \n \nThat Superintendent salary seems indecent to me. What do they do with their days, anyway?\n\n \n Well, I'll tell you what my Superintendent did yesterday. I received the BoE agenda in my e-mail. Under the \"consent agenda\" (where the Board lumps everything of interest and votes on it as a whole without discussion) it mentioned textbook acquisition. So I e-mailed back the new District Clerk and asked if there was a list of the textbooks that I could see prior to the vote. A simple request, no? Well, no, apparently not. The Clerk decided it was important to notify the Supt. and the Dir. of Operations about my e-mail, but she had to put her own spin on it, saying that I wanted to know about textbooks for a specific program, which was not my main interest. I wanted to see how they were appropriating textbooks K-12. At the elementary level, textbook requests from teachers have been ignored for years and the kids end up working almost exclusively with dittos. The Supt. called my cell which as usual, was in a dead zone, so it went to voice mail. She left me a message with a phone number to call her back at that was not in service. So I stopped home, got the correct number and called her back.\n \n She was very nice, too friendly if you ask me, and assured me that she would get back to me with the complete information sometime today. I told her no rush, and filled her in about the lack of textbooks at the elementary level. She was shocked. She was unable to tell me if any requests had come through from the elementary level, only that certain books were the ones the Board had approved. As it happens, I went to Kindergarten and was in Brownies with the Dir. of Operations, so the new Supt. said, \"Oh, we simply must have lunch! No school talk, just normal people talk!\" Uh, ok.\n \n All I wanted was a friggin list of textbooks. I didn't need this request turned into a 3 day interaction. I didn't need to take up the Supt.'s time with a simple request for information. I certainly didn't need the District Clerk making assumptions as to why I was interested in said information. And no offense to the nice lady, but I don't need to \"socialize\" with her at lunch.",

   "You say, I am here as a teacher. I say, I am here as a parent. Neither claim is extraordinary.\n\n And the claim that \"I'm a mansion-dwelling supermodel by week and a nanny by weekend\" is extraordinary. This is the point I was trying to make.\n \n \nYou are making an argument by authority.\n\n An argument from authority is not a fallacy when an appropriate authority is used.\n \n \nUsing circular reasoning, as well.\n\n How is providing evidence that I'm a teacher and then making other statements circular reasoning?\n Can you offer a better way to confirm that I'm a teacher without forfeiting my anonymity?\n \n \nI'm not trying to imply that you're NOT a teacher, but it would be fairly easy, IMO, to go onto an internet forum, say that one was a teacher and express knowledge indicative of someone with experience in teaching.\n\n To the extent that I have? Ms. High Road, who fancies herself damn near an expert, sure didn't do too well.\n \n \nI'm a bit taken back by your excessive ad hominem usage, especially if you're not tenured (or even if you are), but then again, some teachers are really off-the-wall.\n\n My personal remarks do not take the place of the reasoning behind my counterarguments. If someone makes incredibly stupid statements, then I get to call them stupid, but I include evidence or reasoning that shows why the statement is so incredibly stupid.\n \n \nYour science training seems lax, too.\n\n And what specifically, pray tell, makes you think that?\n \n \nBut America IS desperate in that area, so maybe you are an example of what we are lately stooping to.\n\n Don't count on it. I teach the advanced chem courses at my school. Although I wouldn't have gone this far, last week I got introduced to a new employee as \"the smartest teacher we have.\" (I'm working on \"the best teacher we have,\" but I've got some really good ones to leapfrog before I can get there.)\n \n \nAre you The Messenger of The Classroom As It Is ??\n\n I can't speak for every single teacher. I haven't been to every single room. But I can speak to what the currently encouraged practices and theories are.\n I'm the messenger of my classroom as it is, which neither of you have experienced. As you two are denigrating not only the profession as a whole but also me/my teaching, I get to rake you over the coals when you're wrong.\n \n \nAnd when you present it as a valid argument, you are simply making an argument by authority, which is logically fallacious.\n\n *sigh* ... The devil's in the details.There are two basic forms of appeal to authority, based on the authority being trusted. The more relevant the expertise of an authority, the more compelling the argument. ....\n \n The second form, citing a person who is actually an authority in the relevant field, carries more subjective, cognitive weight. A person who is recognized as an expert authority often has greater experience and knowledge of their field than the average person, so their opinion is more likely than average to be correct.\n\n \nIt sounds like, if you are a teacher, you could use some mentorship.\n\n I have a mentor. What exactly do you think my mentor is not doing correctly if you think I could use some mentorship?\n \n \nI don't know why the parents should have to pick up the slack for what the school district isn't doing.\n\n If this is a reference to the tutoring bit Ms. High Road was complaining about, I agree. If it's something else, you'll have to clarify.\n \n \nWe are supposed to get paid for our time, too, you know.\n\n I will never argue that responsible parents don't do incomprehensible amounts of work for their children. (I'm reminded of an episode of Home Improvement where Tim jokingly calculates what he owes Jill for her \"motherwork\" and housework.) That said: As far as I know -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- no, parents are not \"supposed\" to get paid for their time. Parenting is not a paying job. I don't mean that in a derogatory way; I mean it in a factual way. (I don't remember ever hearing about a parent drawing a paycheck for doing laundry and cooking for his/her family, for example.) Those are sacrifices that parents are expected to make because it is for their own offspring. (Whether it is truly fair is probably another discussion.) Personally, I can't imagine what it would be like to be a teacher and a father, let alone a teacher and a (usually more active as a parent) mother -- especially a single mother.\n Here's something I'd like you to keep in mind. I don't blanketly denigrate parenting work. I haven't come on here and declared that either you or Ms. High Road shouldn't be entitled to be parents, or that I pity your children for having terrible mothers, or that your children should be taken away from you. Now, there are things that some parents do that really are not in the best interests of their children, but I don't let that sour the entire lot of parents. But claims like these were aimed at my teaching; you and Ms. High Road insisted that we're overpaid and underworked. She wrote off our extremely long hours as \"[ineffective] time management.\" She seems to think that three months \"off\" means that we sit around picking our noses and drawing a paycheck. You think that we should be denied a standard opportunity to purchase employer-assisted health insurance. Ms. High Road rails against tenure as permanent permission to laze because she refuses to pay attention to required training and eye-popping ethics and behavior codes, each of which overrides tenure. Why should teachers have to put up with this ignorance? Why should anybody?",

You'll have to elaborate. \n\n \n Or \"on authority\" -- you made the distinction, however you put it. But yours was not. The fallacious argument by authority:\n \n An appeal to authority or argument by authority is a type of argument in logic consisting on basing the truth value of an assertion on the authority, knowledge, expertise, or position of the person asserting it. It is also known as argument from authority, argumentum ad verecundiam (Latin: argument to respect) or ipse dixit (Latin: he himself said it). It is one method of obtaining propositional knowledge, but a fallacy in regard to logic, because the validity of a claim does not follow from the credibility of the source. The corresponding reverse case would be an ad hominem attack: to imply that the claim is false because the asserter lacks authority or is otherwise objectionable in some way.\n \n On the other hand, there is no fallacy involved in simply arguing that the assertion made by an authority is true, in contrast to claiming that the authority is infallible in principle and can hence be exempted from criticism: It can be true, the truth can merely not be proven, or made probable by attributing it to the authority, and the assumption that the assertion was true might be subject to criticism and turn out to have actually been wrong. If a criticism appears that contradicts the authority's statement, then merely the fact that the statement originated from the authority is not an argument for ignoring the criticism.\n \n [in full at link]\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_authority",

   "Galactababe,\n \n LOL\n \n I did read one of Ayn Rand's books back in h.s., but don't remember much from it, except that it was absorbing. \n \n My objection to Randism (as I understand it) is the extent to which her libertarian views are carried. She's libertarianism absolute. For example, Randians I've read assert that, on abortion, the fetus is not 'a person' with any rights until birth (overlooking all biological evidence that, indeed, at eight-nine months normal biological development, and viability outside the womb, there is what we consider, a 'baby'). Or, take international borders. Completely open. No government regulation. Not very realistic, IMO, in this day and age, and given the great international disparities in standards of living, labor issues, crime, terrorism, and political hostilities among governments.\n \n I suppose I'm best described as advocating some form of social democracy. A balance between the strengths you describe from individualism and a healthy amount of government intervention, say, in health care, border regulation, social security, education. I am very big on our Constitution.\n \n In the U.S. today, I'd say the educational system could use more of what you describe, but -- for example -- the health care system (where we currently have a mess), less. (This is oversimplifying, though, of course. For the country is not just a tension between individualism and government.)\n \n I don't think I'll be actively stumping for Obama (his campaign people are strangely very possessive of their candidate, even derogatory and rejecting of former Clinton supporters), but it looks fairly certain he's got my vote (based on issues). Ah well, some women (to mention only one group) are not as forgiving as myself (and I, for one, can't hold it against them), so, the Republicans may have yet another Democrat self-destruct.\n \n When will they ever learn?\n \n http://images.jupiterimages.com/common/detail/19/85/23458519.jpg\n \n In some ways, I am a strong advocate of conservatism.",

I suppose the self-described libertarians I've known vary. On the internet, a poster, I think of, viewed as a strict Randist, also a strict libertarian, also an avowed atheist, is mocked by other atheists as essentially theist because of their commitment to the notion of 'free will'. \n \n Interesting what you say about Cappy. I sense a conflict there, too, but I'm not sure if we're talking about the same thing. He can speak for himself, I'm sure, but I don't read him as a strict atheist, though certainly sympathetic. I'd tag him more along the lines of .. a Militant Agnostic Christian Anarchist.\n \n Have you read the poster here, handle, \"cun*time\"? (Not to rudely discuss posters not on a forum thread, but ) I believe he represents his position as strongly libertarian, atheist, and pro-choice --- very into the woman's right to choose. However, his position on moral issues like child abuse -- sounds religious, to me.\n \n Have you seen this \"political compass\" website?

While the Obamites (IMO) are too young-in-spirit to understand the meaning of a conservative proposal (and will never do what they should do to kiss and make up), our allies (on the other hand), with their lengthy and somewhat different perspective, strike me as begging America, on hands and knees, not to send in John McCain.

I do think that receiving tenure has less to do with teacher quality than it would in an ideal system, I do think that there should be a better system of getting rid of ineffective teachers (and I've already stated such.) This doesn't mean eliminating tenure per se, but it might; we need a better accountability system. One problem that arises with such a desire is a lack of a reasonable mechanism. Multiple people complaining about the system have been asked multiple times to propose a reasonable mechanism for establishing accountability and ensuring effectiveness; upon hearing that challenge, everyone clams up. (How about you find out exactly what the Toledo system is/was?)\n Another issue with tenure is teacher's rights, and I serve as an example. I don't casually share my religious thoughts with colleagues because I know I'm in the very unpopular religious minority in my community. Technically, I can be let go for no reason besides my unpopular religion. While this would be a punishable violation of my civil rights in any other situation, a school district can fire me with no legal liability... until I'm tenured. Eliminate tenure, and you have to eliminate the get-out-of-liability-free cards. (Do you know how much all those lawsuits will cost in legal fees?)\n \n The fact vs. opinion issue was this:\n It is a fact that almost 100 tenured teachers got fired. Your article says so. So when you say that only pulling a Lizzie Borden prevents tenure from being a guaranteed paycheck for life, it is a fact that you are wrong.\n That the tenure system needs work is an opinion, one with which I agree. So when you say that I don't agree with my colleagues, it is a fact that you are wrong.\n \n \nStop insulting my intelligence and dispute the articles, if you feel so compelled.\n\n Look, when you post -- and bold -- the bit about almost 100 tenured teachers getting fired, and then continue to represent tenure as a guaranteed paycheck for life, then I get to connect the dots; clearly, somebody here hasn't the intelligence to do it. Or maybe it's just a matter of you not following your own advice?:READING - it's a wonderful thang.\nRight there in black and white: tenured teachers can get fired.

He did so so that he could see first-hand what the situation was in Iraq. It was this trip that convinced him that the surge in Iraq is working. Listen closely to what Obama is saying about the situation over there. Sure, he wants to immediately end U.S. presence in Iraq, but what is he saying about Afghanistan? Ahhhh, haaaa, yes, he's let slip that he feels the need to increase U.S. troops in Afghanistan. (in my opinion, rightly so, as does McCain). But the press isn't amplifying that statement because the Liberal press wants to hold Obama out there as the next Messiah, all peace, make love not war. Last month there were 9 U.S. deaths in Iraq, 500 in Afghanistan. What does that tell you? It tells me the center of conflict has moved, and most likely will soon involve Pakistan which the media has also gone quite silent on. \n \n America needs a President who is willing to gather army intelligence first-hand instead of relying on faulty information like the Bush administration did, not someone who visits the region for the first time in his life for photo ops for his campaign.

He has also had to adapt his position, over time, to the more liberal and socialistic French public. \n \n McCain strikes me as experienced and capable. That he will basically continue Bush's policies.

People aren't robots.\n -Involve the parents more. I say this because the students that always had problems with their grades were the ones that had little or no parent involvement. \n -Re-use equipment. I kid you not, schools nowadays throw out 1 to 2 year OLD computers like nothing! They actually throw these computers out! It's not that hard to update software or put in more memory or hard drives. For reason schools just love to throw out working equipment. How do I know? My father works for the school district.\n -Unions. Really, they have gotten out of hand. I'm all for workers rights, but if that interferes with the advancement of our society I think the government should intervene and stop them. There is no point in keeping a lazy bum that just works 3 hours and slacks off the rest. I know you might think this has anything to do with education, but it certainly does because money should be better spent. \n -Teaching criteria. Focusing on the essentials(math, science, english) as well as the arts (philosophy, art, etc.) Let teachers actually teach. I've actually seen some schools limit new teachers way of teaching. If a teacher can get across some of these kids in different ways than they should be allowed to do it. I'm not saying that teachers should be easy on them, on the contrary, they should challenge students, but they should also make it interesting for them as well. This is challenge of course, but nothing in life is ever easy.emoticon_smile",

In the UK stress related illness takes a big toll on teaching staff. We work 195 days officially, but no teacher I've met spend doesn't work some of the holiday time.

However, it doesn't take a lot for these systems to turn into a method for management to bully staff who challenge their policies, and there have been a number of cases where capability proceedings have been introduced against staff in order to force them out of a particular school.

Standardized tests are currently one of the top three problems with public schools, hands down. So much time is spent teaching students how to test well that coud be spent teaching its ridiculous. There is also the fact that some of these tests don't even provide comparable data. I know personally that the standardized test in Ohio (OAT for Ohio Achievement Test) changes its standard of \"proficient, excelerated\", etc. with each year so you cannot compare the results to anyone elses but students who took the same thing as you at the same time.",

   "-hire teachers who actually want to teach, not for the benefits, not for the pay, but for the students. College and University professors always complain that their students haven't been taught the basics well in High School. I'm not sure I can say this is a union problem or just a problem of the criteria for teaching or that teachers just don't care (again the money.)\n\n Teaching tends to be a fallback career in the U.S. Too incompetent to get and keep a job outside of academia? Be a teacher! It doesn't matter if you don't really want to teach and don't care about the students, you can be a teacher.\n It is too easy to become a teacher. Worse, the U.S. is so desperate for teachers that lousy teachers who don't care rarely get removed.\n \n \n-don't get rid of the arts, sports, etc. Mathematics and English is [sic] good, but without some kind of reinforcement to that, there is no imagination in students. People aren't robots.\n\n This is a double-edged sword. I agree that students need to have the opportunity to do stuff outside of the academic classroom. What causes problems is when these extracurricular activities begin to take precedence over curricular activities. It infuriates me that students will leave school at noon for a three-hour trip to play a football game that starts at 7:00pm. (No, that's not a typo.) My class is more important than the three hours these kids spend doing nothing before the game.\n \n \n-Involve the parents more. I say this because the students that always had problems with their grades were the ones that had little or no parent involvement.\n\n Correlation does not mean causation. Perhaps students who perform well and have active parents perform well because the parents have made education a priority.\n \n \n-Re-use equipment. I kid you not, schools nowadays throw out 1 to 2 year OLD computers like nothing!\n\n Maybe your father's district does. My district is constantly updating hardware and software as well as shifting older computers to rooms that need them when newer ones become available.\n \n \n-Unions. Really, they have gotten out of hand. I'm all for workers rights, but if that interferes with the advancement of our society I think the government should intervene and stop them.\n\n Sorry, but we need the unions, at least in some form. I have some views that are unpopular in my area, and if I were to share them without the protection of a union, I could lose my job for a reason that has nothing to do with my job.\n \n \nI know you might think this has anything to do with education, but it certainly does because money should be better spent.\n\n Teachers pay to be in a union. The district doesn't. Don't be a #####.\n \n \nLet teachers actually teach. I've actually seen some schools limit new teachers way of teaching. If a teacher can get across some of these kids in different ways than they should be allowed to do it.\n\n I've seen some schools limit veteran teachers' way of teaching. When it's a green administrator doing this, it's like a slap in the face. There are lots of methods that sound great on paper but simply don't work in the real world with real students.\n \n \nI'm not saying that teachers should be easy on them, on the contrary, they should challenge students, but they should also make it interesting for them as well. This is challenge of course, but nothing in life is ever easy.\n\n Different people find different things interesting. It's realistically impossible to make every topic interesting to every student. What you seem to underemphasize is that students don't want to be challenged. They want good grades spoon-fed to them off of a silver platter.\n \n \n \nI can't speak for the US but in the UK teachers routinely go into teaching with a real enthusiasm for their subject and for teaching, but this is ground down and battered by the system and the students, so 50% leave teaching within 3 years.\n\n The recent numbers in the U.S. show that between a third and a half of teachers quit within five years.\n Above, I said that it's too easy to become a teacher. There are also too many \"teacher\" jobs that are absolute jokes. Non-joke teacher jobs may be relatively easy to get, but they're hell to have.\n \n \n \nThe best thing I can think of is to switch to a performance based system. Incentive is the only way I know of to motivate people (except threat of punishment which isn't valid here lol).\n\n Oh look, another idea that sounds great on paper but doesn't work in practice. There are too many differences in jobs for any remotely fair incentive system to exist without being so convoluted that nobody understands it (which makes it unfair). I also want to caution against any sort of standard or benchmark, because then some teachers will be \"teaching\" their students to beat the system (on the teachers' behalf) instead of teaching the students.\n \n \nAlso, and I'm not in the business of defending public schools very often, parents have pawned off parenting to schools which obviously detracts from the time spent educating.\n\n Hear, hear. I'm not trying to say that teachers aren't role models, or that they shouldn't be, but they shouldn't be the main source of authority for students.\n \n \n \n \nWell, I don't know about the UK but in the US teachers get about 3 months off paid usually during summer break.\n\n Wrong. We get paid for a certain number of working days (usually between 180 and 195), but that pay is spread out over 11 or 12 months.\n \n \nConsidering most only work 9 to 10 months out of the 12 each year,\n\n Considering you're clearly not paying very much attention, you can **** my ****. I bet you had more time off in the past 18 months than I've had.\n \n \nI'm sure their pay is good enough (60 grand or more a year is the average in CA), especially here in CA.\n\n If you want to bitch about pay in California, then you be sure to specify California. Average pay elsewhere is much lower; average pay where I am is even lower.\n \n \nI know some teachers that are great teachers that actually love thier job, but I also have gotten to know some teachers who could care less about teaching or their students,\n\n Same here. That said, you should then know not to bash the whole lot.\n \n \nThey can't be fired due to contracts, unions, etc. It's a real problem IMHO.\n\n Go back and read the damn thread. I had to beat Galactababe over the head repeatedly because she's ignorant of the truth of this matter. These people can be fired, but only for certain reasons that have to be documented. It's protection, and it's necessary for reasons like the one I stated earlier: Once I've shown that I can teach, I shouldn't have to pretend I'm as loony as my co-workers so that I don't get fired.\n Lest you go nuts about what I haven't said, I agree that the tenure system is likely a bit too much of an imposition. It should be hard to fire someone, but it shouldn't be ridiculously hard, as it often is.\n \n \n \nWhat's recruitment and retention like in the US?\n\n Recruitment is pitiful. Trying to attract professionals to low-paying, labor-intensive jobs by waving $500-$1000 grants doesn't really work. Trying to attract rejected other-job applicants with a small but relatively reliable paycheck and a lacking entrance system works like a charm. Too bad that's not what we want.\n \n \nIn the UK stress related illness takes a big toll on teaching staff. We work 195 days officially, but no teacher I've met spend doesn't work some of the holiday time.\n\n My school has the full range of newbies and extreme veterans. Only the veterans don't spend a day or two (or more) of their short vacations (Christmas, Spring Break) at school working. Newbies are there all the time. And even the veterans spend lots of time, often weeks, of their summer vacation cleaning up loose ends from the previous year and getting ready for the next year. Many spend their \"vacation\" doing things that have either a primary (workshops, classes) or a secondary (travel, seminars) goal of improving their teaching skills.\n \n \nThere are always a few people trying to game the system, and we have a system in the UK for firing and indeed barring from teaching people who can't meet the professional standards expected.\n\n If you think that this system is effective, I want to know about it. Oh, wait...\n \n \nHowever, it doesn't take a lot for these systems to turn into a method for management to bully staff who challenge their policies, and there have been a number of cases where capability proceedings have been introduced against staff in order to force them out of a particular school.\n\n Now, do the rest of you understand this dilemma?\n \n \nI agree the system needs to exist but it has to be fair and transparent, and it certainly shouldn't be on the basis of test scores.\n\n Right. The problem is designing such a system. The sad thing is: If we wiped the slate clean and designed a system from scratch, I bet we'd come up with a system that's eerily similar to the one we have now. Great on paper...",
