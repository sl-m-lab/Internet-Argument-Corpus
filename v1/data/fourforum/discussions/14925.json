   "I pulled this from the Gay Rights forum since this is really all about religion and not gay rights. \n \n \n \nTsk tsk tsk.... Mr. LA Confused shoots himself in the foot again. You haven't taken that in context with the rest of scripture.\n\n \n So you will correct him by doing what you say he is doing wrong. How appropriate that this occurs on this subject.\n \n \nLet's start with Matthew 7:1 -\"Judge not, and you will not be judged.\" (Matthew 7:1)\n \n Jesus is not saying that we cannot make judgments about people, he is saying that we should not be hypocrites if we do. In Matthew 7:5 he says, \"You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck that is in your brothers eye.\"\n\n \n Which if you understood the Bible and believed in it you would reach the conclusion that it is not your place to judge. Remember all have sinned and all fall short which is to say not until God judges will any be righteous in which they would not be a hypocrite, but by then only the righteous will be left and there will be nothing for them to judge in each other.\n \n \nGod acknowledges the legitimacy of civil authorities to judge:\n\n \n Paul acknowledges the authority of the Roman Empire in writing to the Romans. Which seems an odd thing to do since at this point the Emperor is considered a divine being by the citizens as a result of some combination of belief or threat. This in effect is Paul saying to worship a false God and you would like to attribute this to God.\n \n If we go past that we see from the beginning people questioning authority. Paul does it the Apostles do it, the church does it and you do it. God has placed Obama in the role of President. Something you repeatedly voice your dissatisfaction with God's choice. Do you know God's mind that he has made a mistake and being sinless can you can question God? Or just being a hypocrite who takes verse out of context where it best serves what you want it to?\n \n \nRomans 13:1-4: \"Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. (v. 4) For he (the reigning authority) is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of God's wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.\" (Also note Matthew 5:25; Acts 25:10-11)\n\n \n Yep long history of Christians following this doctrine, well as long as they were the authority at least.\n \n \n \nGod has commanded the church to make correct judgments:\n\n \n But yest they seem to make the incorrect one more often than not. A pimp for a Pope, 3 leaders of the Church at one time, exhuming dead Popes to stand trial, elevation from lay person to Pope within a week, murder, rape, forgery, theft are just the tip of the iceberg that is a part of God's church.\n \n \n John 7:24: \"Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgment.\"\n \n \nMatthew 18:15-17: \"If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses (note Deuteronomy 19:15). If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector .\"\n\n \n Which is saying tell him privately and if he doesn't listen leave him alone. It doesn't say keep on him, it doesn't say fight against him, it doesn't say anything that could be considered justification for the way Christians go after people they think have sinned.\n \n \nGod commands us to warn the wicked to turn from their sins:\n \n \"When I say to the wicked, 'You will surely die,' and you do not warn him or speak out to warn the wicked from his wicked way that he may live, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. \"Yet if you have warned the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered yourself. (Ezekiel 3:18-19)\n\n \n Same response as above.\n \n \nBet you don't like that one! Or this one:\n\n \n Bet you don't like it now.\n \n \n\"When I say to the wicked, 'O wicked man, you will surely die,' and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require from your hand. \"But if you on your part warn a wicked man to turn from his way and he does not turn from his way, he will die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your life. (Ezekiel 33:8-9)\n\n \n And again same response.\n \n \nGod commands us to judge according to one's 'fruits.'\n \n Matthew 7:17-20: \"Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.....every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.\"\n\n \n Well how confusing is this when Paul runs around saying works don't matter. I guess it was good that James says they do. By their fruits is rather ambiguos and subjective. You look at me and say the same thing I say about you. Which of our fruits has earned the fire? You of course will deny it is you, but what value is placed on your opinion that the truth of will not be known until it is to late?\n \n \nSaints of Christ will judge the world, and angels:\n\n \n To what end? To judge the Angels is to judge Heaven, what if Heaven is found wanting? The Angels are not immune to lure of sin. A third of Heaven fell with Lucifer, can Heaven afford another rebellion?\n \n \nI Corinthians 6:2: \"Do you not know that the saints will judge the world?\"\n\n \n Do you not know that man may not determine who is a Saint for God?\n Do you not know that all have sinned including the Saints\n \n \nI Corinthians 6:3: \"Do you not know that we will judge angels?\"\n\n \n Yet the Angels abide in Heaven where sin is thought not to exist, yet it does. Was Paul wrong again? What else has he misunderstood that you hold as truth?\n \n \nJesus condemned the teachers of the law and the Pharisees:\n \n Matthew 23:27-28: \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.\"\n\n \n But why? What had they done? They stand accused for the sake of the accusation. What sins specifically did they commit? Why was their sin offering refused and ignored? Is it not hypocritical to force a covenant that one side knows the other will not be able to uphold? To provide a means by which one side may have make amends for past transgressions, only to have the terms change without notice or knowledge that they would? God made his covenant with Abraham who did not break it. God had no right to replace that covenant with a new one. Abraham's was not conditioned upon the behavior of the following generations and God found Abraham to be perfect.\n The only condition was that males were to be circumcised, something that Paul was adamant, not Jesus, not be a part of Christianity.\n \n \nJohn the Baptist rebukes King Herod for adultery and other sins:\n \n Luke 3:19: \"But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other things he had done, Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.\"\n\n \n And look what God did to the one who questioned and judged the ruler that God placed in power. It was not his place to do and God punished him for it.\n \n \nStephen rebukes the Jewish leaders:\n \n Acts 7:51-53: \"You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit! Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him - you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it.\"\n \n\n \n So it is thought Stephen said to those who were punishing him for breaking the law. The fact remains that they were placed in power by God and Stephen was breaking the law and God punished him for that.\n \n There was no betrayal nor was there any murder. The death of Jesus was necessary for God's plan. It was God who required it to happen. You claim to have the gift of spiritual wisdom yet can not understand this very plainly stated truth from the mouth of Jesus. How is it possible you can grasp the more complex issues?\n \n \nJesus rebukes the Christ-deniers:\n \n Jesus said to them, \"If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own; God sent me. Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say. You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me!\" - John 8:42-44\n\n \n Here the author clearly does not understand Jewish theology because these statements are not what is stated on the OT. The devil as he is now called served God faithfully and did only what he was instructed by God to do. We do not believe him because what he says is not the truth.\n \n \nAlso note all the Old Testament prophets who condemned sin and corrupt moral leadership, and who were persecuted for their discernment and duty.\n\n \n Were they? You have historical evidence to back up this claim?\n \n \nYou're busted again (still), Mr. pick-and-chooser. ROTFLOL!\n\n \n Why are the most arrogant the most ignorant?",
