But why common Azerbaijanians should pay for it? Just think: we have to shed out blood for American dirty politicians! We cannot allow this!\n\n If I recall, the US election for president already occurred. Bush was elected again. I hardly see how the US population would have looked at the prospect of another conflict in the middle east as an electable agenda for any candidate...but this is besides the point. As far as active preparations for a war with Iran...I really doubt it. I can see strategic cruise missile strikes, and possibly a strategic air campaign, but ground troops going over the borders seems highly unlikely. The threat in Iran is what it was 10 years ago, that they seek to develop a nuclear weapons program that could potentially de-stabalize the middle east. People always say that the US should not be acting as the world police force, but let me pose this to you: Where would the world be if the US had not stepped in and taken action over the past 100 years? A largely german speaking europe, a japanese speaking SE Asia and pacific rim, communist South Korea, rogue states in possession of nuclear weapons, Israel overrun and decimated by fundamentalist terror supporting governments, small defensless countries in the middle east dissappearing one at a time to rogue states like Iraq...etc. I don't want to see your innocent countrymen die either...don't get me wrong. It is not and should not be their fight. Without sounding aloof, it seems to me that the US as the most powerful nation in the world has a responsibility to monitor and where neccesary regulate other nations when it is clear that they pose a threat to world security. As an American I do not fear Iranian nukes falling onto my lawn, but I do fear a further destabalized middle east.",
