   "Hello everyone! Judging by the late reporting in world media - both American and European - the West has switched from support, to criticism of US promotee, Georgian president Saakashvili. \n \n In general, \"Project Saakashvili\" by Washington proved to be a failure. Mainly because of Saakashvili himself who turned to be a complete XXXXX, mentally distracted and sexually unrestrained (adultery with his personal assistant and press secretary Alana Gagloeva, sexual abuse of famous oppositional female journalist Inga Grigolia and member of Georgian parliament Nadiradze - these are only facts known to public, how many more are behind the screen?) - surely, these are unsuitable qualities for a head of a country, especially while the US links wide expectations with Georgia owing to the forthcoming military operation against Iran, as the US plans to deploy its airbases on Georgian territory, while being not 100% sure Saakashvili will go for it, owing to his impulsivity and unpredictability. \n \n Of course, the US will have to do something that will help to depose Saakashvili. And there is an infallible means that already proved its efficiency in Ukraine - a political murder of a journalist. For your information, in Ukraine it was Georgiy Gongadze, a journalist who was in disfavor with ex-president Leonid Kuchma. In 2000, Georgiy Gongadze was kidnapped and murdered, after that the so-called \"Tapegate\" broke out and resulted in Leonid Kuchma's prescheduled resignation. \n \n I guess, soon we will have another \"Georgiy Gongadze murder case\", now in Georgia, being initiated by US secret service. They even have an equivalent of Gongadze - Ramishvili, now a political detainee.",
