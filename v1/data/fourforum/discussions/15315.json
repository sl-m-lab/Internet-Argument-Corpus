   "  2nd Amendment Advocates Across The US Have Much To Be Proud Of In California \n Despite the generally-held view that 2nd Amendment Rights are a lost cause in California, gun rights activists across the country have much to be proud of with their fellow supporters in the Golden State. With the defeat of every gun control bill in the State Legislature in 2010, including the highly-controversial Open Carry ban bill, AB 1934, 2nd Amendment advocates on the West Coast and all across the nation can celebrate the new-found momentum and renewed vigor with which Californians approach the subject of gun rights in this modern era. Following the national trend of the gun control lobby's dramatically diminishing relevance in modern American poltics, the decades-long encroachment against every common, law-abiding citizen's 2nd Amendment Rights in the Golden State has been stopped cold in 2010 and striking progress forward is being made this year in 2011. \n \n \n A brilliant example of this sudden turn-around in 2nd Amendment advocacy in California occurred recently in the small City of Pleasant Hill, a Bay Area suburb with a population of 33,000. At 7:30 PM on the nondescript Tuesday night of April 26, 2011, a large contingent of 2nd Amendment supporters in California packed the City Hall of Pleasant Hill until it was standing room only to protest the back-door attempts by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and their legal affiliate, the Legal Community Against Violence, to push tax-paying and law-abiding gun dealers out of the city in a concerted effort to force an unpopular gun control agenda down the throats of the local community.\n",
