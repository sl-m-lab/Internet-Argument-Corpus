   "I was recently challenged by someone who disagreed with my assertion that communists acted as cannibals during the Bolshevik Uprising. I thought it was significant enough to warrant its own thread. The following is his response to my calling Bolsheviks cannibals, and my history lesson to the ignorant.\n \n \nTell me where do you get these completely stupid thoughts from? It is obviously false yet you still say such rubbish? I realise that a lot of the time you are being sarcastic, unless you are insane, but I still wonder where you get it from?\n\n \n You are an idiot. It would be wise for you to learn the history of the politics you subscribe to. Any XXXXX should be able to deduce that I did not mean cannibalism in the literal sense, but rather a figurative sense. If anyone wishes to understand what was meant by my statement, I suggest reading the 25 page document, \"Workers' Unrest and the Bosheviks' Response in 1919\", by Vladimir Brovkin. This essay appeared in the Slavic Review, Volume 49, Issue 3. \n \n Basically, what it says is that following the October Revolution, which most workers supported in solidarity with their socialist counterparts, the revolution degraded into widespread discontent of the workers, due to poor treatment and mismanagement by the commissars. \n \n At this time, the Bolshevik Reds were actively involved in fighting a civil war against the Whites. The period between 1917-1921 marked a time of peasant uprisings, and general strikes, by people who felt that the Bolsheviks were betraying the workers, who used their namesake as justification for their revolution. Poor rationing, and the suspension of free-elections of factory management left them with bitter feelings that moved them to express their anger in gradually increasing levels. Further ignoring the demands of the people led to widespread disillusionment. \n \n These groups of workers where classified as Mensheviks, Leftist SR's, and White Guardist conspirators. Thus, the Bolshevik leadership lumped them into the classification of the enemy they were fighting, and treated them accordingly. Wide-scale arrests, reduction of rations, and mass executions were the result. To conclude, this document supports my assertion that communists have acted in a cannibalistic manner in the past, specifically following the October Revolution. \n \n Many of the people killed in this time frame were supporters of the original revolution that had felt betrayed by power-seeking revolutionaries that viewed a dictatorship of the proletariat as a dictatorship by them, and only them. The effect was to further alienate a larger population by 1921. What followed from this was the need to further quell elements that had become hostile to the new regime. This time period started the precedent of labeling subversives, that later evolved into denouncing the opposition as enemies of the people, saboteurs, and hidden enemies used by Stalin during his purges.\n \n If you want to know of further accounts of Bolshevik barbarism, research their use of enemy mutilation. Many times the bodies of civilian men, women, and children were mutilated and left hanging as a warning to other subversives. To them it wasn't enough to leave a pile of bodies in the cities they took, but sometimes they had to resort to the most despicable acts of warfare, which is to desecrate your enemies body. Communists are truly sickening creatures.",

   "While I agree that the Boljevics where burderous bastards, the \"whites\" and the interventionalistic nations where no saints either...\n \n Acording to the Lord Emmont report (an english informationgathering commitee apointed to gather infromation about the Russian revolution) the terror campaigns where not initiated by the Boljeviks, and where not present until the intervetnion by foreign forces. It concluded that \"the boljcevic rise to power did not rest on terror\".\n \n In the \"white\" general Pjotr Wrangels memoars he described how he and the other \"white\" generals dealt with prisoners of war by either killing them on the spot or force-recruit them under threat of death.\n \n According to the Manchester Guardians report 13 juli 1920, the \"white\" officers responded to the question \"how do you deal with your prisoners\" with that they killed all the communists. Commisars and Jew would be killed on the spot, others who they believed where communists where taken aside to expouse the others and where then killed.\n \n When asked about how they treated villagers they responded that they burned every village that was undersuspicion of distributing information to the Bolsjevics. All villagers where then slaughtered...\n \n It has also been admited by Winston Churchill that his allied \"white\" generals (or thugs) commited genocide against the jewish population in Ukraine. An estimated number of 150 000 where exterminated by the white generals Denikin, Petura, Grigoriev and Makhno. The red cross reported later that only this genocide was only stopped when Boljevik troops defeated the whites in Ukraine and thuis put an end to the atrocoties (sp?). \n \n Acording the brittish general Graves there was many horrible murders commited in Russia at the time, but contrary to popular belief, it was not commited by the Boljevics. He estimated that for every murder commited by the Boljevics, 100 where killed by the \"anti-boljeviks\"...\n \n Now the last part seems like a stretch to me. I would be very surprised if it was true. I would however not be surprised if there was some truth to all of this (ie; they where probably just as bad). This does not make the Boljevik crimes any lesser however, it is just important to put it into perspective of the actual situation in russia and the actions of all parties in the conflict...I can provide the source, but its in Swedish so I doubt you`ll make much out of it: http://hem.passagen.se/helge48/webb/kpmlrgislaved/lilla/lillaunder/erika/lenin.html",
