   "Since certain individuals like to throw the liar name around lets see the hypoocracy....\n \n \n \n \n If The Bush Administration Lied About WMD, So Did These People -- Version 3.0\n by John Hawkins\n Since we haven't found WMD in Iraq, a lot of the anti-war/anti-Bush crowd is saying that the Bush administration lied about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Well, if they're going to claim that the Bush administration lied, then there sure are a lot of other people, including quite a few prominent Democrats, who have told the same \"lies\" since the inspectors pulled out of Iraq in 1998. Here are just a few examples that prove that the Bush administration didn't lie about weapons of mass destruction... \n \n \"[W]e urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs.\" -- From a letter signed by Joe Lieberman, Dianne Feinstein, Barbara A. Milulski, Tom Daschle, & John Kerry among others on October 9, 1998 \n \n \"This December will mark three years since United Nations inspectors last visited Iraq. There is no doubt that since that time, Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to refine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer- range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies.\" -- From a December 6, 2001 letter signed by Bob Graham, Joe Lieberman, Harold Ford, & Tom Lantos among others \n \n \"Whereas Iraq has consistently breached its cease-fire agreement between Iraq and the United States, entered into on March 3, 1991, by failing to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction program, and refusing to permit monitoring and verification by United Nations inspections; Whereas Iraq has developed weapons of mass destruction, including chemical and biological capabilities, and has made positive progress toward developing nuclear weapons capabilities\" -- From a joint resolution submitted by Tom Harkin and Arlen Specter on July 18, 2002 \n \n \"Saddam's goal ... is to achieve the lifting of U.N. sanctions while retaining and enhancing Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs. We cannot, we must not and we will not let him succeed.\" -- Madeline Albright, 1998 \n \n \"(Saddam) will rebuild his arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and some day, some way, I am certain he will use that arsenal again, as he has 10 times since 1983\" -- National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, Feb 18, 1998 \n \n \"Iraq made commitments after the Gulf War to completely dismantle all weapons of mass destruction, and unfortunately, Iraq has not lived up to its agreement.\" -- Barbara Boxer, November 8, 2002 \n \n \"The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retained some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capability. Intelligence reports also indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons, but has not yet achieved nuclear capability.\" -- Robert Byrd, October 2002 \n \n \"There's no question that Saddam Hussein is a threat... Yes, he has chemical and biological weapons. He's had those for a long time. But the United States right now is on a very much different defensive posture than we were before September 11th of 2001... He is, as far as we know, actively pursuing nuclear capabilities, though he doesn't have nuclear warheads yet. If he were to acquire nuclear weapons, I think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would we.\" -- Wesley Clark on September 26, 2002 \n \n \"What is at stake is how to answer the potential threat Iraq represents with the risk of proliferation of WMD. Baghdad's regime did use such weapons in the past. Today, a number of evidences may lead to think that, over the past four years, in the absence of international inspectors, this country has continued armament programs.\" -- Jacques Chirac, October 16, 2002 \n \n \"The community of nations may see more and more of the very kind of threat Iraq poses now: a rogue state with weapons of mass destruction, ready to use them or provide them to terrorists. If we fail to respond today, Saddam and all those who would follow in his footsteps will be emboldened tomorrow.\" -- Bill Clinton in 1998 \n \n \"In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11, 2001. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Should he succeed in that endeavor, he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East, which as we know all too well affects American security.\" -- Hillary Clinton, October 10, 2002 \n \n \"I am absolutely convinced that there are weapons...I saw evidence back in 1998 when we would see the inspectors being barred from gaining entry into a warehouse for three hours with trucks rolling up and then moving those trucks out.\" -- Clinton's Secretary of Defense William Cohen in April of 2003 \n \n \"Iraq is not the only nation in the world to possess weapons of mass destruction, but it is the only nation with a leader who has used them against his own people.\" -- Tom Daschle in 1998 \n \n \"Saddam Hussein's regime represents a grave threat to America and our allies, including our vital ally, Israel. For more than two decades, Saddam Hussein has sought weapons of mass destruction through every available means. We know that he has chemical and biological weapons. He has already used them against his neighbors and his own people, and is trying to build more. We know that he is doing everything he can to build nuclear weapons, and we know that each day he gets closer to achieving that goal.\" -- John Edwards, Oct 10, 2002 \n \n \"The debate over Iraq is not about politics. It is about national security. It should be clear that our national security requires Congress to send a clear message to Iraq and the world: America is united in its determination to eliminate forever the threat of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.\" -- John Edwards, Oct 10, 2002 \n \n \"I share the administration's goals in dealing with Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction.\" -- Dick Gephardt in September of 2002 \n \n \"Iraq does pose a serious threat to the stability of the Persian Gulf and we should organize an international coalition to eliminate his access to weapons of mass destruction. Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to completely deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power.\" -- Al Gore, 2002 \n \n \"We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction.\" -- Bob Graham, December 2002 \n \n \"Saddam Hussein is not the only deranged dictator who is willing to deprive his people in order to acquire weapons of mass destruction.\" -- Jim Jeffords, October 8, 2002 \n \n \"We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction.\" -- Ted Kennedy, September 27, 2002 \n \n \"There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein's regime is a serious danger, that he is a tyrant, and that his pursuit of lethal weapons of mass destruction cannot be tolerated. He must be disarmed.\" -- Ted Kennedy, Sept 27, 2002 \n \n \"I will be voting to give the president of the United States the authority to use force - if necessary - to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security.\" -- John F. Kerry, Oct 2002 \n \n \"The threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real, but as I said, it is not new. It has been with us since the end of that war, and particularly in the last 4 years we know after Operation Desert Fox failed to force him to reaccept them, that he has continued to build those weapons. He has had a free hand for 4 years to reconstitute these weapons, allowing the world, during the interval, to lose the focus we had on weapons of mass destruction and the issue of proliferation.\" -- John Kerry, October 9, 2002 \n \n \"(W)e need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime. We all know the litany of his offenses. He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation. ...And now he is miscalculating America's response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction. That is why the world, through the United Nations Security Council, has spoken with one voice, demanding that Iraq disclose its weapons programs and disarm. So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real, but it is not new. It has been with us since the end of the Persian Gulf War.\" -- John Kerry, Jan 23, 2003 \n \n \"We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandates of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them.\" -- Carl Levin, Sept 19, 2002 \n \n \"Every day Saddam remains in power with chemical weapons, biological weapons, and the development of nuclear weapons is a day of danger for the United States.\" -- Joe Lieberman, August, 2002\n \n \"Over the years, Iraq has worked to develop nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. During 1991 - 1994, despite Iraq's denials, U.N. inspectors discovered and dismantled a large network of nuclear facilities that Iraq was using to develop nuclear weapons. Various reports indicate that Iraq is still actively pursuing nuclear weapons capability. There is no reason to think otherwise. Beyond nuclear weapons, Iraq has actively pursued biological and chemical weapons.U.N. inspectors have said that Iraq's claims about biological weapons is neither credible nor verifiable. In 1986, Iraq used chemical weapons against Iran, and later, against its own Kurdish population. While weapons inspections have been successful in the past, there have been no inspections since the end of 1998. There can be no doubt that Iraq has continued to pursue its goal of obtaining weapons of mass destruction.\" -- Patty Murray, October 9, 2002 \n \n \"As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, I am keenly aware that the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is an issue of grave importance to all nations. Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process.\" -- Nancy Pelosi, December 16, 1998 \n \n \"Even today, Iraq is not nearly disarmed. Based on highly credible intelligence, UNSCOM [the U.N. weapons inspectors] suspects that Iraq still has biological agents like anthrax, botulinum toxin, and clostridium perfringens in sufficient quantity to fill several dozen bombs and ballistic missile warheads, as well as the means to continue manufacturing these deadly agents. Iraq probably retains several tons of the highly toxic VX substance, as well as sarin nerve gas and mustard gas. This agent is stored in artillery shells, bombs, and ballistic missile warheads. And Iraq retains significant dual-use industrial infrastructure that can be used to rapidly reconstitute large-scale chemical weapons production.\" -- Ex-Un Weapons Inspector Scott Ritter in 1998 \n \n \"There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years. And that may happen sooner if he can obtain access to enriched uranium from foreign sources -- something that is not that difficult in the current world. We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction.\" -- John Rockefeller, Oct 10, 2002 \n \n \"Saddam's existing biological and chemical weapons capabilities pose a very real threat to America, now. Saddam has used chemical weapons before, both against Iraq's enemies and against his own people. He is working to develop delivery systems like missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles that could bring these deadly weapons against U.S. forces and U.S. facilities in the Middle East.\" -- John Rockefeller, Oct 10, 2002 \n \n \"Whether one agrees or disagrees with the Administration's policy towards Iraq, I don't think there can be any question about Saddam's conduct. He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do. He lies and cheats; he snubs the mandate and authority of international weapons inspectors; and he games the system to keep buying time against enforcement of the just and legitimate demands of the United Nations, the Security Council, the United States and our allies. Those are simply the facts.\" -- Henry Waxman, Oct 10, 2002 \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

Neither do I, have any sympathy for the palestinians. I really could care less about one idiot killing the other for the SAME G_D. But I do have to ask why these a-rabs who have all this land throughout the mid-east, africa, and southern aisia have a problem with this TINY sliver of land in the mid-east that makes up less than 1% of muslim land so important that they would like to kill every Jew that lives there... Perhaps a great champion of justice such as yourself can enlighten me? BTW Rachel Corrie got what any XXXXX who stands in front of a bulldozer deserves.... 2 sides of mans blind indifference to his fellow man and Corrie chooses sides in a fight thats not hers and got her just deserts.... As to Iraq. I can only ask you that does past mistakes prevent future action? A buhddist mantra is right thought, right action. Yet these Buhddists didn't start out like that right? So if a brutal regime threatens the world with WMD real or bluffing (look at the origional post for the \"believers\") can we not act because of past actions? I disagree with this notion. Perhaps in someway we are accounting for those actions and we are NOW atoning for those past mistakes with the blood, sweat and tears of our troops (not that this is the opinion that I hold). Have you considered that? \n \n The UN has been exposed for the kickbacks and money making schemes off of the Oil for palaces program that I trust nothing that comes from anyone under thier control (as if I ever did)... Hans Blix included.... The resolution after resolution was designed to maintain the status quo of france, russia, Germany, Kofi, the UN to rake in billions of dollars of the oil for palaces program.....

   "Rev,\n \n First off. My apologies. I didn't realize you said that the post on my website wasn't you. \n \n I'm a liberal not a democrat, there is a difference. I work to make the world a better place, I don't complain about what republicans do all day long, aka most democrats. \n \n I understand what you are saying about the creed of a soldier. However consciences always come into play. That's why there are cases of suicides here and there or people who serve that are adamantly against the war and can't wait to get out. I think that soldiers understand it's their duty and their job, but I'm sure there were a lot of soldiers in Vietnam saying \"what the hell am I doing here.\" That doesn't make them fight with any less intensity or have less positive intentions in mind but these factors take a toll on a soldier. It's like a marriage or the priesthood, there are vows and promises, but sometimes people question themselves or the institution they've entered. \n \n Over three fourths of the Jordanian population is Palestinian and at the same time they are treated as the lowest end of the society while still being the majority. That is part of the problem and it has been in the history of the Palestinians, their \"Arab brothers\" haven't embraced them and haven't helped them in the process for autonomy. While about 80 percent of the OTs were offered to the Palestinians they were offered in the form of a bantustan and enclaves with bypass roads and restrictions splitting most of the West Bank and Gaza into ghettos surrounded by settlements of Israel. If you really look at the plan, it was shaky from the start. Not to mention in the final negotiations which was set up to move forward from the general descripitions of '93, Israel and the U.S. didn't budge on their plans. I don't support Oslo or the way it was signed, Arafat in secret going against the Palestinian delegation, and I think that a move towards peace should have been made in the early nineties with a better plan for a two state solution. \n \n On Iraq\n \n About France and Russia, who's to say that there financial agenda is more important than ours (I don't think the Iraq war was about wmd's I think that was the scapegoat) and if there is a conflict obviously they aren't going to support us. Not to mention Europeans tend to shy away from war in recent years anyway. I think that the world thought Iraq had wmd's until the UN inspectors starting casting serious doubt in February. I think at that point our administration should have taken a step back and give the UN more time to see what was up. I understand Saddam went against UN resolution after UN resolution but if there was some kind of progress being made they should have extended the period of time that the UN had in inspecting Iraq. The inspectors were kicked out and now came back so it's not as though they had been there since the Gulf War and still made no progress. I don't believe he was an imminent threat at the time and many anaylsts on the matter agreed in February and thought that an extra 60 or 90 would have done no harm and could only see positive outcomes, whether it be assurance that he didn't possess wmd's or that he did possess wmd's.\n \n As for libya, they were about as dangerous as a 7 year old girl. I think it's ironic that were now easy sanctions on a country with Ghaddifi, whom we considered such a terrorist state just a couple of months ago. Is that the message we are trying to send? Kill hundreds of people over Lockerbie and get off free if you pretend to give up programs of nuclear weapons that you don't have anyway.\n \n Remi",

   "The American public will realize that without force,Bush is powerless in negotiating with other countries.He couldn't persuade Trurkey to let us stage an assault from the north,he couldn't persuade Pakistan to allow us into the border region of Afganistan to hunt down O.B.,He couldn't find a way of dealing with N.Korea,so he let China do the talking for us,and now the coalition seems to be falling apart.Spain is pulling out,Portugal is pulling out,the Dominican Republic is now considering pulling out.Although they are small numbers of troops,it shows that other countries are finding that the war in Iraq is not worth the backlash they will recieve for supporting us.\n\n \n So, your problem with Bush is that he couldn't negotiate with people who hate us? And I'll bet you anything that there are American special forces operating inside that border region in Pakistan with the Pakistani government's position. They just can't, and won't, declare it publically.\n \n Other countries, like the 3 you mentioned, are indeed finding that the backlash they get for supporting us isn't 'worth it.' I wonder what they'll be like in a few years? Al-Qaeda has made it very clear that they will not only attack the US, but any targets of opportunity they can get to in Europe. They'll attack other Muslim countries (Saudi Arabia, Jordan). And Muslim clerics across Europe have apparently declared an open jihad against the west. I think that people, even Europeans, will have to realize that these radical-Islamic terrorists are out to kill and destroy anyone who doesn't agree with them.",
