No US governemnt agency is allowed to collect random intellignece on Americans who are suspected fo no crime.

In the 70's, they decided that the threat from the AIM was too important to apply such rules to, and you ended up with pine ridge. NAzis, Soviets, Sauds, and most other tyrannical, totalitarian states have or had internal security agencies who collected intel on their civilian populations. In the US we don't. Instead we have watchdog groups that collect intel on our government. I guess it boils down to the age old question....is the government your servant, or your master? If it is your master, then of course they should monitor your every move to ensure forced loyalty. If they are your servant, they should mind their own business, as good servants do.",

   "Got this mainly from: http://rogerailes.blogspot.com/\n \n http://www.buzzmachine.com/index.php/2005/09/08/the-911-commissions-responsibility/\n http://www.indyweek.com/durham/2004-09-22/cover.html\n \n \nThe 9/11 Commission bears some responsibility for the disaster that American disaster relief has become.\n \n I've been trying to find how exactly FEMA's reorganization plan came: Were the details laid out by the commission or by Congress? Doesn't matter, really.\n\n \n I mean, really, to blame the 9/11 comission, as lame as it was, for DHS and FEMA is just asinine. And then in the same statement say that you don't know whether the blame goes to the 9/11 comission or to congress is truly lame.\n \n And DHS was formed BEFORE the 9/11 comission. Duh!\n \n \nBut then, as former counter-terrorism czar Richard Clarke explained in his recent book Against all Enemies, \"the White House legislative affairs office began to take a head count on Capitol Hill.\" Realizing that the Lieberman Bill would likely pass both houses of Congress, with no credit given to the White House, in June 2002 the administration changed its tune, calling for a new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that would be even larger than the one Lieberman had proposed.\n \n Under the administration's plan, 22 government agencies, FEMA among them, would be merged into the DHS. Analysts in and out of government warned against subsuming the emergency agency's vital functions in a new super-department. \"There are concerns of FEMA losing its identity as an agency that is quick to respond to all hazards and disasters,\" the agency's inspector general noted in a memo to Allbaugh. Congress' Government Accountability Office judged the merger to be a \"high-risk\" endeavor for FEMA, and the Brookings Institution, a leading Washington think-tank, cautioned in a report that such a move could hobble the agency's natural disaster programs. \"While a merged FEMA might become highly adept at preparing for and responding to terrorism, it would likely become less effective in performing its current mission in case of natural disasters as time, effort and attention are inevitably diverted to other tasks within the larger organization.\"\n \n But Bush's proposal won out, and a shift in priorities from natural disasters to counter-terrorism immediately took hold. In its 2002 budget, the White House doubled FEMA's budget to $6.6 billion, but of that sum, $3.5 billion was earmarked for equipment and training to help states and localities respond to terrorist attacks.\n \n Michael Brown, a college friend of Allbaugh's who had served as FEMA's general counsel, was recruited to head the agency, which would now be part of the DHS's Emergency and Response Directorate. When the reorganization took effect on March 1, 2003, Brown assured skeptics that under the new arrangement, the country would be served by \"FEMA on steroids\"--a faster, more effective disaster agency.\n\n \n It's just funny how far some will go.",
