He is putting millions of lives at risk due to his party politics and his entrenched hypocrisy. Oh and coming from you I suppose that anyone who has not donated to the 700 club or the FRC is not a born again Christian either...\n \n FYI it is a very hard habit to break cursing once you've been in the Navy ;)",

   "What current form of the bill? Democratic Senators stated today that they hadn't seen the actual bill. It's all smoke and mirrors. The only thing that is going to be voted on is the chance to lose their seats in the next election. I'm betting the Democrats lose a landslide in Nov. 2010. Any takers?\n\n \n If they fail to pass reform I will take that bet JP... And the reasoning behind the changes and constant back and forth is based upon the whims of a pissy little Senator who has a gripe that a few democrats rode on his opponents bus instead of his in the last election.. Way to go Joe....",

Liebermann is closer to the will of the people than just about all of the Democrats. The MAJORITY of Americans don't want government-run healthcare and the DNC isn't getting that point....today.

I don't support it and even if it went into conference I doubt little would change...\n \n I personally now feel the bill should be tore up and redone from the beginning.. It does little to help and truly drive down costs and now will only leave insurance companies with a big fat blank check and 30 million new customers that have to buy into one of their burdensome plans...\n \n Leiberman's sniveling was the last nail in the coffin in my opinion.. But it seems the Democrats are so desperate to pass anything and bran it as \"reform\" so there you have it...\n \n I stand with Howard Dean on this the bill should be tore up and redone from the beginning with republican aid and ideals worked into it to truly make it bipartisan... and TRUE reform...Funny how now he is the new scapegoat for the DNC... It sickens me to no end...",
