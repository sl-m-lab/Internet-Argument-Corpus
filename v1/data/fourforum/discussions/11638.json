   "On various occasions, I have posted questions to those that support gun control efforts, and those questions have gone unanswered. I, on the other hand, have answered many questions from these same people, without referring to a source of information with an obvious bias. Typically, the quotes I have posted are direct quotes from federal, state or local law. I have yet to post any quotes from groups such as the NRA or other gun rights groups. I would in all seriousness appreciate a well thought out and reasoned response to the questions below. Both of these are quotes from other threads that have gone unanswered. I find it somewhat curious that often, the thoughts and beliefs of supporters of gun control measures, are shaped by information from sources that are obviously biased.\n \n \n \n The anti-gun crowd constantly berates gun manufacturers for sidestepping the assault weapons ban by simply producing a gun with minor changes from those made prior to the ban going into effect. As an example, AR-15 style rifles never went out of production, they were simply built without collapsing stocks, flash suppressors or bayonet lugs. So in essence, they were never removed from public access, thus they were still as available as they always were prior to the ban, just without these items...With this being the case, how is it that the assault weapons ban is in any way responsible for any decrease in crime? Either it was garbage legislation that did nothing or it was effective in removing these types of guns from the streets. Which was it????\n \n\n \n Ian,\n \n I am curious as to why you specifically exclude self defense as a valid reason for owning a gun. Data from the FBI shows that victims who resist an aggressor by use of a gun are less likely to be injured than when they use other weapons for defense. I would think that this alone would validate the ownership of a gun for defensive use. On a related note, as was recently confirmed by the SCOTUS, owning a firearm is an individual right. I am not aware of any other right that you are required to to demonstrate a reason prior to exercising.\n \n\n \n \n JW",

   "Ian, \n \n Thank you for taking the time address the question posed. I will not fault you for your opinions, but I do disagree with your stance on rights needing to be justified. As you pointed out, this is likely a result of having been born and raised in a country in which we have a standing constitution, and the belief that this constitution does not grant rights, but guarantees them. If you read our constitution carefully, you will find that it indeed, does not grant rights to the people. It only places restrictions on our government, to prevent the infringement of rights that are considered to be bestowed upon all men. I think this is the fundamental and key difference in our beliefs (yours and mine) and could possibly reflect the differing beliefs of our home nations as well.\n \n While I do think that with rights, comes responsibilities, I firmly believe that free men grant powers to their government, not that government allows those governed to have privileges. If you have to demonstrate a need, or a reason, it is not a right. The moment that a government requires the people to demonstrate a need or a reason, it becomes a privilege, something that is granted. \n \n Owning a firearm carries with it a large amount of responsibility, but I am not a proponent of mandatory training/evaluation. This is largely due my belief that less government is better, but this also allows a government to strip a fundamental right through arbitrary rulings. When a government controls access to any item by requiring such training, it becomes too easy for that government to make it impossible to attain said item, by making the training/evaluation requirements impossible to attain. We have seen this many times in various States in the U.S. California is a great example. \n \n In California, there is a provision of law for citizens to attain a concealed weapons permit, however, law enforcement has discretionary power in deciding who, if anyone, will be granted a permit. As a result of this, the only people with permits are, generally speaking, those with political ties or some other influence, yet it leaves the common man out in the cold. If this same principal were used to evaluate a persons need or justification to own a firearm, it gives the government the power to regulate a right, and this is what our constitution is intended to prevent. This not only applies to the right to keep and bear arms, but to all rights of free men. Governments do not rule free men, free men dictate what powers a government may posses.\n \n JW",

   "Ian, \n \n It does indeed become tiresome refuting arguments made based on emotional responses, or sensationalized viewpoints. The debate over gun ownership is certainly a complex issue, and this is what I think makes it interesting to discuss.\n \n I would suggest, if you have not already done so, that you carefully read our constitution. As I stated before, it truly does not grant rights. The wording of the constitution is specific in that it only restricts government powers. Since we are talking about arms, let's use the second amendment as an example. It does not say \"the people have the right to own arms.\", or other such similar wording. What it does say is that the government does not have the power to infringe on the right of the people to have arms. While this may seem like parsing words, the meaning of the two statements are vastly different, in that in the first, permission is being granted, and in the second, a specific limitation is being placed on the powers of government.\n \n As to origin of the right to bear arms, all creatures posses the right and even the instinctual need to protect themselves. Our forefathers stated this in a manner that was consistent with their christian beliefs, in that their wording showed that they believed these rights to be endowed by God. Regardless of the origin of man, he is like any other animal in that he has not only a right but also a need to protect himself. Man differs from common animals in that he is a tool user, whereas most other animals are not. As technology has developed, so have our tools, including firearms. A firearm is indeed a tool that can and is used for defense of ones life and loved ones. It is arguably the most effective tool, readily available to law abiding citizens.\n \n Justification...It can certainly be argued that banning guns may reduce criminal access to them, but even in GB where they are prohibited, criminals still access guns through illegal means. My personal opinion is that as long as criminals have access to guns through illegal means, it is inappropriate to prevent peaceful citizens from keeping arms of their own.\n \n Hell, I just looked at the clock....I have to get cleaned up and go chase bad guys. I work 3-11 shift. I will continue this post when I get home from keeping our streets safer.\n \n JW",

   "Omega isn't worth responding to. Apart from one thing, actually, because it made me grin.\n Do you often set up hephalump traps in your back yard?\n\n \n Until 1938 the coelacanth was thought to be long extinct until living specimens were found in African waters. To this day new species of animals are continually being discovered in various places, proving that we're far from done exploring this world and learning all of its secrets.\n \n Just because something hasn't been found, or can't be justified in a manner that everyone can accept, doesn't mean that it doesn't exist or that it should be ignored and disregarded.\n \n \nClarification: Just because something hasn't been justified yet does not, indeed, mean that it will never be justified.

The difference between us does indeed seem to be that I see the constitution as granting rights, whereas you see the constitution as protecting rights.\n\n \n So to you the government has full authority to do anything it pleases and you as a subject have absolutely no recourse except to go along with it?\n \n \nIf this is the case, then how do you believe that humanity acquires these 'rights' in the first place? Is it that 'they are granted to us by our Creator', as per the Declaration? If not that, then how?\n\n \n That's a good question, now I'll give you one. How do you believe that the government, which is elected and put into place by the people, is given absolute authority to rule over the lives of the people that assembled it, and it faces no restrictions or checks and balances to keep them from becoming omnipotent terms of scope of authority?\n \n \nBy my viewpoint, all things must be justified - from religion to politics via philosophy and science.

That is to say: if it can be shown to me that granting a population access to firearms has a positive result and not a negative one. As such, the argument 'but it's a right!' carries very little weight with me beyond showing interesting historical context.\n\n \n Well let's look at it this way. Before there were firearms the most commonly available weapons were swords, spears, axes, maces, etc. These were good, but only the strong and physically fit could have any chance of using one effectively, and anybody that was too young, too sick, too old or too feeble was at the mercy of the one who could take control at the point of a sword simply because they were in better physical condition than anybody else. This isn't the case anymore, because physical condition has been removed as a variable from the equation, meaning that a little old lady in a wheelchair can effectively protect herself against somebody built like a football player.\n \n How exactly is that not a positive result?",

Well let's look at it this way: our Founding Fathers fled Britain to get away from King George who had absolute rule over all the land and could institute whatever program he wanted, and nobody could oppose him for any reason. Being fresh from that, why on Earth would they institute a system of government with nothing to keep it from becoming just like King George?\n \n Second, even if the Founding Fathers were unconcerned with the possibility of a government becoming tyrannical and ruling the nation like it was a dictatorship, why on Earth would they bother drawing up a list of privileges that the government has to extend to its subjects? Why would the government, a body free of oversight, be required to extend any privileges to the people it rules? Why would they even need a limited list of what would be a privilege to be extended to the people, wouldn't they have the full authority to decide what the people are to enjoy and what isn't to be?\n \n Third, if the Constitution is nothing more than a list of privileges granted by the government and can be rescinded without reason or notice, why on Earth would we have a Supreme Court charged with determining if government actions violated the Constitution? If the Constitution isn't about keeping the government in check, but rather outlining privileges that're to be extended to the people, how did the Supreme Court determine that George Bush's warrantless wiretapping program violated the 4th Amendment? \n \n If the Constitution isn't about protecting the people and restricting the authority of the government, then surely something can't be determined as being unconstitutional since the program in question, as well as the list of privileges both come from the same government and they have full authority to overturn a privilege if they feel like it, right?",

   "I apologize for cutting my last posting short, but time got away from me before I could finish it completely.\n \n Continuing on the subject of justification...Ian, you propose that \nall things must be justified - from religion to politics via philosophy and science.\n While I do agree that, if there is a need to justify something, that science is an appropriate means of seeking justification, I strongly disagree with you regarding the employment of philosophy for the same purpose. Philosophy varies greatly from one person to the next. Philosophy is generally not considered to be factual, in fact, Webster's dictionary defines philosophy as follows...\n \n \n1 a (1): all learning exclusive of technical precepts and practical arts (2): the sciences and liberal arts exclusive of medicine, law, and theology <a doctor of philosophy< (3): the 4-year college course of a major seminary \n 2 a: pursuit of wisdom b: a search for a general understanding of values and reality by chiefly speculative rather than observational means c: an analysis of the grounds of and concepts expressing fundamental beliefs3 a: a system of philosophical concepts b: a theory underlying or regarding a sphere of activity or thought <the philosophy of war<4 a: the most basic beliefs, concepts, and attitudes of an individual or group b: calmness of temper and judgment befitting a philosopher\n\n \n Notice that the first definition specifically excludes technical precepts and practical arts. Notice also that it is defined as being chiefly accomplished through speculative rather than observational means.\n \n I much prefer the idea of utilizing scientific means to make any determination. Gun control has proven to be largely ineffectual at reducing crime within the United states. Granted, an all out ban has not been instituted to determine it's effect. If in your view, a right should be justifiable, should not the removal of a right be justifiable as well? Should that justification not be based on more than just speculation? We can certainly speculate that banning guns may reduce crime, but this is not a certainty. Even if violent crime were to be reduced by such measures, it is not likely that violent crime would be eliminated. Is it reasonable to remove a right of the law abiding based on the actions of those with no regard for law?\n \n There has long been a battle raging over what the founding fathers of our country intended with regard to the second amendment. Their motives can easily be seen in such writings as the Federalist papers and various other articles written by them during the time in which they were working to get a constitution ratified. I have never seen any evidence that these men desired, or approved of a government with the power to disarm the people. There are, however, many quotes made by these men that showed they viewed the right of the people to own private arms, as an essential means to providing for continued peace an freedom. \n \n I think a better solution is available than the idea of banning ownership outright. Stricter and more rigid enforcement of current law is a good place to start. Increased penalties, harsh mandatory sentencing for felons in possession of a firearm, and I am sure I could think of more. There is no benefit in creating laws that only effect the law abiding, and not the criminals. Just as criminals in England have found ways to get guns, so will the criminals in any other country that chooses to restrict it's people from possessing arms.\n \n JW",

   "Flyboy:\n \n To me, who starts from the idea that man is born without any rights, the wording of the constitution does two things. Not only does it restrict the government, but by enumerating the 'rights to be protected', it defines those rights - and also defines them as 'unbreakable'. To me, this wording isn't justification enough - we are back to the idea of 'freedom vs security', where I would (as you asked) happily ban guns if it resulted in a reduction in violent crime. \n \n With regards to justification, your other arguments are more familliar to me. They represent a misunderstanding of the pro-control side that assumes an argument of ours is 'gun control will prevent all violent crime'. I freely admit that this is not the case.

   "Ian, \n \n You and I may be closer in opinion than would be readily noticed. While I do agree that controls placed on firearms can have an effect on criminal access, I have yet to be shown definitive information that indicates the overall effect of such controls is a net benefit. If crimes committed with a firearm are reduced, but other violent crimes such as forcible rape, violent home invasions, aggravated assault, ect. increase significantly in number, I am not sure that the overall effect is desirable. Just as guns are used for crime they are also used to prevent or defend against crime. So far, it has been difficult to determine, with any real certainty, how often this occurs, and to what degree it influences crime rates as a whole. I think our primary difference in views is where each of us would draw the line between freedoms and security. \n \n I am currently looking at some data regarding crime in various countries, but even this is not definitive in that there are numerous components to the causes of crime. Comparing different countries can also be misleading due to differences in social values and many other things that I am sure that I am not aware of. Everything from population density to unemployment rates and many other things tend to influence crime rates. Because of the way in which various countries track and report crimes, I am not sure that my research will be anything approaching definitive, but so far it has at least proven to be interesting. \n \n I think that one of the major things overlooked by those on both sides of the issue, is that correlation does not equal causation. In other words, just because a given geographic area that has imposed strict gun control enjoys a low crime rate during a given time span, this does not indicate that it is the result of these controls. There are simply too many variables that influence crime. \n \n I do have one question for you, and I understand that you may not be able to answer it, because I surely would not be able to either. Mostly it is something to ponder on. You stated the following...\n \n \nwhere I would (as you asked) happily ban guns if it resulted in a reduction in violent crime. \n\n \n Yet the way it is worded is somewhat ambiguous, in that reduction could be as little as preventing one incident. My question is how do we define the point at which the line should be drawn? So far, I know of no way to show precisely how many crimes are prevented by gun control, or how many times guns are used to prevent crime. This is largely because of the difficulty in showing causation vs. correlation.\n \n I also want to thank you for the pleasant discussion so far. While our views are different, I think we could probably sit down over a pint or two and have a great conversation.\n \n Justin",

   "I'm kind of upset that Flyboy beat me to posting, because now anything I present is gonna look like me doing nothing more than riding on his coattails. But, I have stuff to say and there's no reason to not go along with it.\n \n \nTo me, who starts from the idea that man is born without any rights, the wording of the constitution does two things. Not only does it restrict the government, but by enumerating the 'rights to be protected', it defines those rights - and also defines them as 'unbreakable'.\n\n \n Alright going by this, at least from your perspective, the Constitution simply grants rights rather than explaining how we believe that these rights exist and are the property of sentient beings. What I'd like to know is how this conclusion is reached. If man truly has no rights of their own, nothing that's guaranteed to them, etc. how exactly does the Constitution go about granting these rights and keeping them safe from government interference? What power does the Constitution have, if it simply grants rather than recognizes rights, that effectively prevents the government from interfering too far?\n \n \nTo me, this wording isn't justification enough - we are back to the idea of 'freedom vs security', where I would (as you asked) happily ban guns if it resulted in a reduction in violent crime.\n \n \n Slight problem with that idea, however. Crime rates continually fluctuate and vary from year to year. The average number of unjustified killings with firearms average around 12,000 a year, but the exact number of never the same; sometimes it's a few hundred more or a few hundred less, sometimes the amount differs by as many as several thousand depending on everything. So for that idea to be acceptable then there would first need to be proof of a drastic and significant change in the rates, something that can't simply be written off as being just part of the average fluctuation of rates.\n \n Keep in mind that we're talking around a very important right, something that the ones doing the killings don't have, so whatever law is proposed isn't going to really impact them. So if it's going to affect only those that aren't breaking the laws in the first place, then the results should be substantial in exchange; to me nothing short of a 51% drop could be considered justifiable reason for doing away with an established right.\n \n Think about it for a minute. Would managing to reduce the average number of deaths per year, which are always in constant fluctuation, by only 100 lives or so, be justification enough to doing away with the right(s) of nearly 300 million Americans?\n \n \nWith regards to justification, your other arguments are more familliar to me. They represent a misunderstanding of the pro-control side that assumes an argument of ours is 'gun control will prevent all violent crime'. I freely admit that this is not the case. Instead, the argument is that more control will reduce crime by reducing supply - not elliminating. If this argument is correct, we come to the decision which is more impotrant? That some of the population have the enjoyment and placebo (if our argument is correct) safety of owning a gun, or that less violent crime exists? We're back to freedom vs security again, and in this case I would definitely go for 'security'.\n\n \n As said before, unless there's some serious proof that banning gun ownership will reduce total death by firearms by a substantial amount that can't possibly be ignored as just another normal fluctuation in year-to-year rates, then there's really not much point in discussing the subject since it's all academic and hypothetical. Sure it's easy to draw the simple conclusion that \"no guns = no killing\" but in reality nothing is that cut and dry and simple, there's too much to take into account.\n \n \nThe second argument you hinted at was that gun control will only affect the 'law-abiding citizens'. This, too, is false - otherwise why have any laws at all? Just as with all other laws, introducing the law (and punishment for breaking it) reduces the criminalised activity.\n\n \n I think Flyboy is the expert here, he's a police officer and has seen the affects gun control has had and how well it works and doesn't work.\n \n \nOh, and apologies - you misunderstood me. '[these must be justified:] Religion to politics via science and philosophy' was meant to be read so that all four things need to be justified - philosophical and scientific ideas included. Generally, it's true that logic/science is used to justify everything, but there is also some interesting philosophical ideas behind the scientific method, which themselves require justification (see the Problem of Induction).\n\n \n I'll tackle this one when I'm not so tired.",
