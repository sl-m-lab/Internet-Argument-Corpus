Allow syria to build a pumping station there, and allow it to be staffed by syrians. There is no chance that Syria is going to try to take the area by force, since their military is in such a poor state, and extremely doubtful that they would be willing to risk international reprocussions by violating a UN brokered treaty. From a tactical stanpoint, Syria attacking israel would be like canada attacking the United States. It could happen, but the results are so predictable that it would be incredibly foolish.\n \n \n I think ther is a bigger issue here, which is why Israel has fueled this conflict from day one, and that is a pretty major financial consideration. Currently, Israel only manages to stay afloat due to massive amounts of aid from the US. This is jsutified to the public because of the attacks and the instability in the region. I don't think that sending billions per year to a peaceful israel is likely to be a popular idea, especially as we witness the inevitable decline of our own economy. Israel has no real hope of surviving on its own from a financial standpoint. They have no natural resources to speak of, a decidedly substandard industrial base, and a very poor service base. No businessman in his right mind would be willing to do make a capitol investment in israel for at least the next 20 or 30 years due to the probability of a militant uprising. This puts israel in the position of being just another thrid world country. I really don;t think that those who run israel like to think of their nation becoming a Columbia for jews.",

   "In 2004 the US has provided for $6 billion in direct military and financial aid to Israel plus loan guarantees of $9 billion. With a population of five million, that's $3k per person. With a per-capita income of $13.7k, our aid is 22% of their income. In 2003, GDP growth was 1% (any analyst knows what it takes to show a positive 1% figure, gulp and plug it), a close to collapse number for any other nation with 82% of GDP derived from service industries churning the same currency into dust. Those are the official numbers.

   "Possibly Egypt and Iran. Depends. Many unforseen factors are in the works. \n\n \n Pls, tell me this is a joke. Iran I could almost see. Egypt has far more to gain by the continuation of Israel than by its destruction. \n \n \n \nAnd can win with conventional forces. Isreal does not need nuclear weapons. Their push for them has only accelerated a nuclear arms races in the ME. \n \n \n This is true\n \n \nAnd they sold it to China behind our backs. \n \n \n Also true\n \n \nEgypt primarily normalized relations because we give them billions in Aid. That money is \"stop fighting\" money. When that dries up, who knows what will happen? I do remember saying ceded any other land.\n\n \n We gave them roughly 47 billion dollars to leave israel alone. That was a one time deal. Currently, we are paying them just to be our friends (something we are terribly short of). i think the plan was to take egypts support of our ME policies and use it to \"prove\" to the world that we were doing the right thing there. Instead, the citizens of egypt were so furious with their government for playing nice wiht us during the current crisis that there was a very real danger of an overthrow. So, we backed off of the \"egypt is our buddy\" approach.\n \n Egypt doesn't really need US foreign aid all that bad. They are a fairly profitable country on their own. \n \n \n \nNuclear armed Iran, possibly Egypt. Many factors at work. \n \n \n Egypt is likely to have nukes before Iran. They have already admitted they are working on them. They have 2 reactors capable of producing weapons grade material in small quantitites. I think it is possible, or even probable, that they have already designed a crude device. \n \n The only reason that Egypt has managed this (since Israel has a long history of unprovoked attacks against neiboring coutries who try to develope nuclear sources, even if they are cwertified by inspectors as being energy usage only) is that the US has p[revented any cross border sorties. In the event of a large sacle war in the ME, Egypt would be a MUCH better ally than israel. Israel has a superior military, but cannot afford to leave the country with it, nor do they have adequate facilities to base American troops there on a large scale. Egypt, on the other hand, does have those facilities, and while theri military is not up to date (by any stretch of the imagination) they DO have more than enough to hold their own borders and secusre US bases.\n \n \n \nAssuming we aren't bogged down in say, oh, A China-Taiwan conflict or a renewed Korean war.

Egypt makes quite a bit of money selling goods to Israel, they are not going to screw that up for a war that would not particularly benifit them.\n \n \nCurious: Where did you get the casulity numbers? \n \n \n The israeli numbers are official israli government numbers. The palestenian numbers are from the red cross, since israel doesn't bother to count how many innocent civilians they kill.\n \n \nIsreal should be abandonded by the US.

Not with conventional forces, at this particular time. Armies are supposed to be insurance, anyway.\n\n \n And if the time ever does come that they could, no number of troops in the golan heights is going to be able to do anything to stop them. In order for Syria to pull off something like this, they would need the kind of economic growth that can only come from widespred international trading, I.E through their association with the EU. This would still be at least 5-10 years down the road. If, at that time, Syria decided to invade Israel, there is probably very little israel, or anybody else, will be able to do to stop it if current trends continue. The way the EU and China are growing in terms of economic power, in 5 years the US will not be able to risk angering either of them. Syria is already considered an EU ally, and Chian has been an ally of Syria since back in the days of the old soviet republic. \n \n \n \nWhy shouldn't Israel destroy potential nuclear dangers on their borders given the historical context where-by all their neighbours have continually tried to snuff out there very existence - even self-styled liberals as yourself are against them; you have posted that Israel should give up territory to the Palestinians, but no other country should! Only Israel needs play by your version of the rules.\n\n \n You don't blow up power plants in neiboring nations based on what you THINK they MIGHT do with them. In Syrias case, this argument doesent hold any water at all, since the IAEA had already certified the facilities that israle destroyed as NOT suitable for weapons development. The only threat that those facilities held was that they were being designed to power Syrias industial development. Israel does not want to be the poorest country in the ME and is taking steps to see that does not happen.\n \n Syrai had already brokered deals with several European companies, contingent on the Syrian infrastructure being able to support them. The only thing that syria lacked was adequate power generation capabilities. In bombing the power facilities, israel hoped to derail these plans. Instead, some of those countries have banded together and said \"Ok, WE will build an maintain the facility, and arrange for modern weaponry to defend it, and if Israel attacks, our governments will take care of it\".\n \n The British and French have already as much as gauranteed the safety of the new facility. I personally don't think that Israel is likely to continue these illegal attacks. It would be interesting if they did, though. I would really like to see how America would react to a couple squadrons of British Typhoons taking out every major air base in israel, while SAS and french foreign legion troops destroy israel border guards.\n \n Only israel has to play by the rules? No, my rules are simple....Everybody should obey the law, and nobody should be treated as subhuman trash.

They could never hold it, of course, but they could certainly take it quickly before being bombed into oblivion. \n \n You keep infering that israel needs to protect itself from Syria.

   "This has been stated by Sharon on several occasions. If Syria were to attack Israel, it would be the last thing they ever did,\n\n \n Sure, and Saddam said that if the US attacked, they'd face annihilation; talk is cheap. This is what I mean by your bias. You have a penchant for believing Israel when it talks of aggression, but not if Syria did the same - because according to you they can't win anyway.\n \n \nYes, like the buffer zone between the US and Mexico, or the US and Canada. They are not using the Golan heights as a buffer zone NOW, what makes you think they would need to in the future? The only reasons they are hell bent to hold onto the Golan heights is the fact that they have built a big listening post at the top which they use to spy on their neiborghs, and the fact that it is the only source of fresh water in the area. \n\n \n Mexico and Canada are buffer states. They are militarily weak neighbours, it's why the US continues to meddle in affairs throughout the hemisphere. They are the big boys on the block.\n \n Where do you get the statement that they are not using the Golan Heights as a buffer now?\n \"Is the Golan important for Israel's security?\n First, holding the Heights gives Israel strategic depth. The Golan territory is roughly 10 miles by 40 miles. All of Israel, including the Golan and the West Bank, is only approximately 45 miles wide by 270 miles. (First-time visitors to Israel almost invariably remark on how small the country is.) Thus, in the north, the Golan Heights makes the territory under Israel's control nearly fifty percent wider than it would be otherwise. This buffer zone, this extension of territory where Israel faces its most formidable enemy, is an important military asset for Israel. This remains true even in the age of missile warfare. It bears noting that, in the summer of 1990, all of Kuwait's valuable assets were in easy reach of Iraq's forces, which took them quickly. But Saudi Arabia's key assets lay across wide stretches of desert, which made an Iraqi conquest far more difficult. Though Iraq had Scud missiles, Saudi Arabia's strategic depth spared it the fate of Kuwait.\"\n http://www.yahoodi.com/peace/golan.html\n \n \nThere is only a very limited military force in the region as it is. In fact, it is small enough that Syria could conceivably (no, almost certainly) take the region by force if they wished. They could never hold it, of course, but they could certainly take it quickly before being bombed into oblivion. \n\n \n You just argued that they couldn't win. Now that they can... even in a limited sense.. and who knows, that's all they might want. I don't know their mind; you do... so I guess I should take your expert opinion on this. Even wars are fought for limited gains.\n \n \nYou keep inferring that Israel needs to protect itself from Syria. History would suggest that it is the other way around. \n\n \n No, I infer that Israel needs to protect itself from potential enemies. One of these might be Syria. You suggest categorically that Syria can't beat Israel, therefore will never enter a war with them. You are stating this as if it is a fact. I don't know that Israel is directly facing an immediate threat. You seem to have more knowledge on this than I do (but you don't cite any sources). I do know that a state will have an army to defend its interests.\n \n \n it has been decades since Syria made an aggressive move towards Israel.

This hides a terrible truth that Syria has been engaged in a covert war against Israel - both directly by harbouring those who would harm Israel, and in southern Lebanon where pro-Syrian forces fought pro-Israel forces. A lot has happened since the 1974 war, only you don't seem to see it; unless it's an argument directed against Israel. And certainly by holding the Golan Heights they make it harder for supplies to get into southern Lebanon.\n \n \nI don't understand the pro Israeli viewpoint here at all.

I am in fact anti-Daewoo. You have consistently twist and turn everything so that it's anti-Israel. There is indeed no logic to this. You support efforts of peoples to defend themselves, but when they are against Israel's interests (you don't seem to support Israel's rights to defend itself). You support PLO claims for lands, but only those against Israel. You support a nation to recover land it's lost in war, but only when it's against Israel. You diminish a nation's credibility if it receives foreign aid but only when this policy is concerning Israel. You are in short anti-Israel on every front. And therefore I am anti-Daewoo. I don't support such sweeping condemnations of anyone especially when you so selectively apply any and all criteria of criticism. I will continue to argue against you whilst you continue to present such blatantly biased argument.\n \n I have in the past recognised Israel repression. I appreciate their interventions (in southern Lebanon) in their true light; that of oppressor. I believe that all oppression should be condemned. I frequently criticise US involvement in Iraq. I believe I am doing this so, consistently. You, however, seem to turn a blind eye to anything done against Israel, because to you, they don't justify being around, and are the baddies.\n \n As an Orthodox Christian I respect ALL human life, and don't condone killings, (including the death penalty or abortion). I have posted on these forums against US Gun Laws and against US aggression too. However when I see someone condemning only one set of killings; or even suggesting that one lot of killings is justified because the other lot are acts of evil, then I wade into the argument. For me, even killing in the name of self-defence is a sin. However, for you, the Palestinians are justified in their killings; but Israel is not. Or at the very least, you would suggest that the Palestinian aggression is 'understandable' in the light of all the evils visited upon them by Israel. This goes against my beliefs for the respect of life; especially in light of the fact you don't condemn aggressions vented against the Palestinians by other Arabs! (note well September 1970 when Jordan sent in the army to expel them by force; which lent its name to the \"Black September\" movement which ironically carried out its revenge attacks not on Jordan, but Israel, with the same kind of logic you display)\n \n \n Israel, which routinely runs cross border sorties against neiborghing nations, needs protection from its neiborghing nations, none of which have attacked Israel in year.\n\n \n \nIsrael, which has killed 200,000 Palestinian civilians, need protection from the Palestinians, who have killed 40,000 Israelis\n\n \n Are you saying that because the Israelis have been more successful at killing, they should be condemned?\n \n \n Israel, which is blatant violation of international law and has been caught in the commission of so many human right atrocities that it is hardly worth counting them anymore is just \"fighting to survive\", but the Palestinians, who have been the target of those atrocities and the victims of israls lawbreaking, are somehow just criminals.\n\n \n If we are going to appeal to law, then we need to do so fairly. You will not; you would voice your concern over the land stolen from the Palestinians by Arab states if you were concerned with 'justice'. Oddly enough you are silent by Syria's support for terrorists. It seems you are only finding voice when it's against Israel...\n \n see\n \"Syria and Terrorism\"\n at\n http://www.free-lebanon.com/LFPNews/2003/November/10312003/10312003.html",

   "Sure, and Saddam said that if the US attacked, they'd face annihilation; talk is cheap. This is what I mean by your bias. You have a penchant for believing Israel when it talks of aggression, but not if Syria did the same - because according to you they can't win anyway.\n\n \n Iraq did not have the military assets to destroy America. Israel, on the other hand, unquestionably does have the military assets to destroy Syria. Yes, I believe when israel makes threats theya re to be taken seriously because they have shown themselves to be a ruthless state that has no compunction whtsoever when it comes to killing civilians or attacking other nations, provoked or not. \n \n Syria doesn't generally spend a lot of time making htreats towards israel. Teh last time they said anything about it, the fellow running that horse and pony show got on TV and said \"We are no match for Israel militarily, but if they continue to attack and kill our civilians, we will have to take steps to protect them\". This was following Israels last cross border raid, where they killed 400 people in a refuge camp. \n \n \n \nMexico and Canada are buffer states. They are militarily weak neighbours, it's why the US continues to meddle in affairs throughout the hemisphere. They are the big boys on the block.\n\n \n The military difference between Mexico and the US is rougly equivent to the military difference between israel and syria.\n \n \nWhere do you get the statement that they are not using the Golan Heights as a buffer now?\n\n \n According to this years Janes, israel has less than 100 troops there. \n \n \n\"Is the Golan important for Israel's security?\n First, holding the Heights gives Israel strategic depth. The Golan territory is roughly 10 miles by 40 miles. All of Israel, including the Golan and the West Bank, is only approximately 45 miles wide by 270 miles. (First-time visitors to Israel almost invariably remark on how small the country is.) Thus, in the north, the Golan Heights makes the territory under Israel's control nearly fifty percent wider than it would be otherwise. This buffer zone, this extension of territory where Israel faces its most formidable enemy, is an important military asset for Israel. This remains true even in the age of missile warfare. It bears noting that, in the summer of 1990, all of Kuwait's valuable assets were in easy reach of Iraq's forces, which took them quickly. But Saudi Arabia's key assets lay across wide stretches of desert, which made an Iraqi conquest far more difficult. Though Iraq had Scud missiles, Saudi Arabia's strategic depth spared it the fate of Kuwait.\"\n http://www.yahoodi.com/peace/golan.html\n\n \n This is absolutly rediculous. That little strip of land, which can be crossed in less than 25 minutes, off road, in a fairly slow moving vehicle, is doing NOTHING for security. This is just stupid. you missed the important part of this article \n \n \n- from A Special Report Prepared for the U.S. Center for Security Policy\n\n \n The Us center for security policy is composed of folks like John Foss who says intelligent things like \"This is not a time for America to be scaling back our nuclear arsenal. We instead need to be developing more advaced weapons to ensure the prosperity of our nation\".\n \n Their motto is \"Promoting peace through strength\". These are many of the same folks who managed to convince past US presidents that we REALLY NEEDED enough nuclear weapons to destroy the world 4 times over (like the ability to destroy it once wasn't enough). \n \n Of course, seeing how your \"source\" is yahoodi, I am not surprised that they are trying to pretend that a garbage neocon group like the \"US Center for Security Policy\" is actually a legitimate place to get factual information. \n \n \nYou just argued that they couldn't win. Now that they can... even in a limited sense.. and who knows, that's all they might want. I don't know their mind; you do... so I guess I should take your expert opinion on this. Even wars are fought for limited gains.\n\n \n Apparently you and I have a VERY different idea of what the word \"win\" means. If rolling your tanks into the desert so they can be bombed into oblivion is \"winning\" in your book, I suppose you could call this a \"win\" for Syria. Most would call it a decisive and humiliating defeat, but I guess you are entitled to your own opinion.\n \n \n \nNo, I infer that Israel needs to protect itself from potential enemies. One of these might be Syria. You suggest categorically that Syria can't beat Israel, therefore will never enter a war with them. You are stating this as if it is a fact. I don't know that Israel is directly facing an immediate threat. You seem to have more knowledge on this than I do (but you don't cite any sources). I do know that a state will have an army to defend its interests.\n\n \n No, syria cannot beat israel. Take a look at their respective militaries, then come back if you really want to argue this. Besides, israel has nuclear weapons and I seriously doubt, given their complete disregard for civilian lives to date, that they would hesitate to use them. \n \n \n \n \nYou are suggesting here that Syria is but a poor victim of Israel's aggression. This hides a terrible truth that Syria has been engaged in a covert war against Israel - both directly by harbouring those who would harm Israel, and in southern Lebanon where pro-Syrian forces fought pro-Israel forces. A lot has happened since the 1974 war, only you don't seem to see it; unless it's an argument directed against Israel. And certainly by holding the Golan Heights they make it harder for supplies to get into southern Lebanon.\n\n \n Ok, let me rephrase this. It has been decades since Syria made an agressive move towards israel. Is that more clear? YES, in 1974, after israel illegally invaded another nation, Syria sent forces to assist Lebanon, which they had a mutal defense treaty with. In 2 days, israel shot down 80 syrian planes, while only loosing 2 themselves. \n \n you are right about the fact that by holding the golan heights, they are managing to starve people to death in southern lebanon. I suppose this may bee seen as a worthy goal by some.\n \n \n I believe a nation has a right to defend itself... \n \n \nConsider these few facts...\n Fact:\n In the past Israel faced Syria as an enemy\n Fact:\n Syria used the Golan Heights (specifically) as a weapons platform\n Fact:\n Syria is still hostile towards the existence of Israel.\n\n \n Yes, and in the past israel has used the golan heights as a weapons platform, and they certainly seem hostile towards syria. Personally, I put more weight on how the two have acted since the end of the war. Israel has, since the end of the war in 1964, invaded yet another neiborghing country and run hundreds of attacks on syria. syria, on the other hand, has stuck to the peace deal without fail. Who is really the dangerous one here? At one time, the US was at war with mexico. wea re not still running cross border raids.\n \n \n\"While it is arguable that it is in Syria's best interests that it would also want to normalize its relations with Israel and therefore remake its image in the West, President Assad of Syria has a very strong dislike of Israel and has maintained a very hard line position for peace.\"\n http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/59/2960\n\n \n See above. Israel certainly seems to be the entity here that does not want peace, thus their continuous attacks on otehr contires in the region.\n \n \nThus not so long ago Israel were suspecting a surprise attack on the Golan Heights (note well before we were discussing a war of limited aims!)\n \"Syrians Talking of Surprise Attack\"\n http://www.io.com/~jewishwb/iris/archives/737.html\n\n \n I have to wonder how they got the title for that, since nowhere in the entire article does it say anything about Syrai saying anything abouta surprise attack. The entire article is about a couple of israelis theorising that Syria could concievable attack at some point in the future.\n \n \n \nI am not pro-Israel per se. I am in fact anti-Daewoo. You have consistently twist and turn everything so that it's anti-Israel. There is indeed no logic to this. \n \n \n I don't twist, I don't spin. I call it like I see it. There is just no way to look at this and come to the conclusion that the israelis are the good guys here. So, instead of trying, you tell yourself \"he is just twisting this all around\". But i am not. Wake up. \n \n \nYou support efforts of peoples to defend themselves, but when they are against Israel's interests (you don't seem to support Israel's rights to defend itself). \n \n \n Sure I do. I just don't support unprovoked attacks against other countries under the guise of protecting themselves. How is destroying a power plant that has already been certified by inspectors as not having any weapons potential at all defending themselves? How is illegally holdin gonto a bunch of land protecting yourself? How is murdering 40,000 civilians in 48 hours protecting yourself? It is not. These are war crimes, and should be treated as such.\n \n \nYou support PLO claims for lands, but only those against Israel. \n \n \n The PLO is not really holding claims on land in other nations. Ther are two possible explanations for this. The first is that the ethnic group which we call palestenians did not actually make up the entire population of palestine. They were primarily focused in the areas that is now israel (and the occupied territories). The other possibilty is that the other nations that ended up with land that was once part of palestine absorbed the palestenians who lived there into their country and treat tehm liek any other citizen. By contrast, the palestenians living on land controlled by israel are treeted as sub humans. Instead of absorbing the indiginous population, israel embarked on a policy of ethnic cleansing. Hitler would be proud/\n \n \nYou support a nation to recover land it's lost in war, but only when it's against Israel. \n \n \n No, in fact, not at all. his is pretty much an unsupported statement, since I cannot really remember discussing this in regards to other natiosn (probably since it wouldn;t really fit within the framework of this thread). I am against criminals, and people who break the law.\n \n \nYou diminish a nation's credibility if it receives foreign aid but only when this policy is concerning Israel. \n \n \n I diminish a nations credibility when they are soley dependant on MY MONEY, and will be so for the forseeable future. Yes.\n \n \nYou are in short anti-Israel on every front. And therefore I am anti-Daewoo. I don't support such sweeping condemnations of anyone especially when you so selectively apply any and all criteria of criticism. I will continue to argue against you whilst you continue to present such blatantly biased argument.\n\n \n And yet, you can't disprove the argument. The simple fact of the matter is that israel has done some rotten, horrible, evil things, and for some reason ther seem to be a lot of people out there who are either so stupid or so blind that they refuse to see them. I don't make apologies for peopel who break the law, or who do evil things. \n \n Israel is without a doubt the greatest threat to the security of not only the middle east, but America as well. By supporting Israel, we have tied ourselves to the evil crimes they have commited. MY MONEY has been used to murder palestenian children. This bothers me. \n \n \nI have in the past recognised Israel repression. I appreciate their interventions (in southern Lebanon) in their true light; that of oppressor. I believe that all oppression should be condemned. I frequently criticise US involvement in Iraq. I believe I am doing this so, consistently. You, however, seem to turn a blind eye to anything done against Israel, because to you, they don't justify being around, and are the baddies.\n\n \n I certainly do not turn a blind eye to the acts of agression against israel (which at this point is pretty much limited to the freedom fighters there). I don't tunr a blind eye to them, quite the contrary, I support them fully in their endeavor. I give thousands of dollars a year to charities that I know full well send the money back to Hamas. As an added bonus, I get to write these controbutions off when tax time rolls around. \n \n I support anybody, anywhere in the world that fights oppression and tyranny, regardless of who the opressor or tyrant is. \n \n \nAs an Orthodox Christian I respect ALL human life, and don't condone killings, (including the death penalty or abortion). I have posted on these forums against US Gun Laws and against US aggression too. However when I see someone condemning only one set of killings; or even suggesting that one lot of killings is justified because the other lot are acts of evil, then I wade into the argument. For me, even killing in the name of self-defence is a sin. \n \n \n Maybe someday you will grow up and get a dose of the real world. Your attitudes are likely to change.\n \n \nHowever, for you, the Palestinians are justified in their killings; but Israel is not. Or at the very least, you would suggest that the Palestinian aggression is 'understandable' in the light of all the evils visited upon them by Israel. This goes against my beliefs for the respect of life; especially in light of the fact you don't condemn aggressions vented against the Palestinians by other Arabs! (note well September 1970 when Jordan sent in the army to expel them by force; which lent its name to the \"Black September\" movement which ironically carried out its revenge attacks not on Jordan, but Israel, with the same kind of logic you display)\n\n \n Actually, they carried out revenge attacks on Israel for Black September not because they blamed israel for their forcible ejection by Jordan, but because it was the forcible deportation by israeli troops that put them in Jordan. The Jordanian army did expel them. Tehy loaded them on trucks and moved them roght to the border then waved goodbye. When the israelis moved them, they force marched them across the desert with no food or water, and machine gunned those who refused or lagged behind. And you really wonder why they hold a grudge against israel for this? The jordanians removed them becasue they could not afford to keep them there. That was a huge number of refugees, and the jordanian government was paying for all of them. Israel moved them because they want a racially pure state. \n \n \n \n \n \nAre you saying that because the Israelis have been more successful at killing, they should be condemned?\n\n \n I am saying that it is absolutly rediculous for the israelis to claim they need protection from the palestenians in light of the numbers.\n \n \n \nIf we are going to appeal to law, then we need to do so fairly. You will not; you would voice your concern over the land stolen from the Palestinians by Arab states if you were concerned with 'justice'. Oddly enough you are silent by Syria's support for terrorists. It seems you are only finding voice when it's against Israel...\n\n \n If the palestenians were fighting jordan or egypt for the return of illegally gained land, I would supportthem in their endeavor. Again, I do not make excuses for people or look at the world through shaded lenses. Folks who breakl the law get what they get. Are you talking about Syrias support for the palestenian freedom fighters? Or are you talking about ehir support back in the 80's of anti western terrorists? If it is the former, they are freedom fighters. I support them, too. If you are talking about their support of anti western terrorists back in the 80's amd early 90's, they have stopped, paid billions in reperations, and been punished.",

How is illegally holdin gonto a bunch of land protecting yourself? How is murdering 40,000 civilians in 48 hours protecting yourself? It is not. These are war crimes, and should be treated as such.\n\n \n Arafat is a terrorist. I suspect you won't support him going to face any court... that's right, he's not a terrorist, but a 'freedom fighter' lol\n \n \n You support PLO claims for lands, but only those against Israel. \n\n \n \nThe PLO is not really holding claims on land in other nations. Ther are two possible explanations for this. The first is that the ethnic group which we call palestenians did not actually make up the entire population of palestine. They were primarily focused in the areas that is now Israel (and the occupied territories). The other possibilty is that the other nations that ended up with land that was once part of palestine absorbed the palestenians who lived there into their country and treat tehm liek any other citizen. By contrast, the palestenians living on land controlled by Israel are treeted as sub humans. Instead of absorbing the indiginous population, Israel embarked on a policy of ethnic cleansing. Hitler would be proud/\n\n \n Partly true. The PLO doesn't claim any bit of Palestine that's part of any nation (except Israel), for like you they are anti-Israeli. They ignore their own land rights simply to illicit anti-Jewish hatred.\n \n \n You support a nation to recover land it's lost in war, but only when it's against Israel. \n\n \n \nNo, in fact, not at all. his is pretty much an unsupported statement, since I cannot really remember discussing this in regards to other natiosn (probably since it wouldn;t really fit within the framework of this thread). I am against criminals, and people who break the law.\n\n \n So you would suggest that Jordan make an offer to hand land over to the Palestinians? How about compensating them for attacking them in September 1970.\n \n \n You diminish a nation's credibility if it receives foreign aid but only when this policy is concerning Israel.\n \n \n \nI diminish a nations credibility when they are soley dependant on MY MONEY, and will be so for the forseeable future. Yes.\n\n \n Ah-ha, but you only speak out against Israel. What about the 3rd world nations of Africa. Parasites! lol\n \n \n You are in short anti-Israel on every front. And therefore I am anti-Daewoo. I don't support such sweeping condemnations of anyone especially when you so selectively apply any and all criteria of criticism. I will continue to argue against you whilst you continue to present such blatantly biased argument. \n\n \n \nAnd yet, you can't disprove the argument.\n\n \n Which one? Your rant against nations dependent upon US money is brand-new and will take some time. If you mean with regards to Syria, well I don't have access to Syrian government officials like you do.\n \n \nThe simple fact of the matter is that Israel has done some rotten, horrible, evil things, and for some reason ther seem to be a lot of people out there who are either so stupid or so blind that they refuse to see them. I don't make apologies for peopel who break the law, or who do evil things. \n\n \n It seems to me that you make concessions about 'crimes' depending on who you believe is the victim. I don't hear you ranting about suicide-bombers, or people who cruise into beaches in high-powered boats to spray holiday makers with bullets.\n \n \nIsrael is without a doubt the greatest threat to the security of not only the middle east, but America as well. By supporting Israel, we have tied ourselves to the evil crimes they have commited. MY MONEY has been used to murder palestenian children. This bothers me. \n\n \n Yes, you have tied yourself to Israel. I have no argument here.\n \n \nI have in the past recognised Israel repression. I appreciate their interventions (in southern Lebanon) in their true light; that of oppressor. I believe that all oppression should be condemned. I frequently criticise US involvement in Iraq. I believe I am doing this so, consistently. You, however, seem to turn a blind eye to anything done against Israel, because to you, they don't justify being around, and are the baddies. \n\n \n \nI certainly do not turn a blind eye to the acts of agression against Israel (which at this point is pretty much limited to the freedom fighters there). I don't tunr a blind eye to them, quite the contrary, I support them fully in their endeavor. I give thousands of dollars a year to charities that I know full well send the money back to Hamas. As an added bonus, I get to write these controbutions off when tax time rolls around. \n\n \n You do, by already referring to them as 'freedom fighters'.\n \n \nI support anybody, anywhere in the world that fights oppression and tyranny, regardless of who the opressor or tyrant is. \n\n \n Which Arab democracy do you support?\n \n \n As an Orthodox Christian I respect ALL human life, and don't condone killings, (including the death penalty or abortion). I have posted on these forums against US Gun Laws and against US aggression too. However when I see someone condemning only one set of killings; or even suggesting that one lot of killings is justified because the other lot are acts of evil, then I wade into the argument. For me, even killing in the name of self-defence is a sin. \n\n \n \nMaybe someday you will grow up and get a dose of the real world. Your attitudes are likely to change.\n\n \n I think you're incredibly bitter about something. I find it odd that you'd be so hostile against someone promoting peace and understanding.\n \n \nHowever, for you, the Palestinians are justified in their killings; but Israel is not. Or at the very least, you would suggest that the Palestinian aggression is 'understandable' in the light of all the evils visited upon them by Israel. This goes against my beliefs for the respect of life; especially in light of the fact you don't condemn aggressions vented against the Palestinians by other Arabs! (note well September 1970 when Jordan sent in the army to expel them by force; which lent its name to the \"Black September\" movement which ironically carried out its revenge attacks not on Jordan, but Israel, with the same kind of logic you display) \n\n \n \nActually, they carried out revenge attacks on Israel for Black September not because they blamed Israel for their forcible ejection by Jordan, but because it was the forcible deportation by israeli troops that put them in Jordan. The Jordanian army did expel them. Tehy loaded them on trucks and moved them roght to the border then waved goodbye. When the israelis moved them, they force marched them across the desert with no food or water, and machine gunned those who refused or lagged behind. And you really wonder why they hold a grudge against Israel for this? The jordanians removed them becasue they could not afford to keep them there. That was a huge number of refugees, and the jordanian government was paying for all of them. Israel moved them because they want a racially pure state. \n\n \n Even here you show your bias by calling them 'revenge attacks'. That is, they aren't actions, but re-actions against something else done to them. About time people take responsibility for their actions.\n \n \nAre you saying that because the Israelis have been more successful at killing, they should be condemned? \n\n \n \nI am saying that it is absolutly rediculous for the israelis to claim they need protection from the palestenians in light of the numbers.\n\n \n Really? Then who is it that's blowing up Israeli buses? See even here you recognise that a smaller number, a smaller force will challenge a larger more powerful force, if they think the gains are worth it. You argue against yourself.",

   "I thought he was just talking about American forces posed against him.\n\n \n HE said \"America\" If he meant \"American forces poised against Iraq\", he was still talking nonsense, as he didn't even have the military assets to destroy that\n \n \n \n \nIsrael has been threatening its neighbours for years. So far, their neighbours still continue to exist.\n\n \n Yess, they have also carried out those threats. Israel has continually run cross border raids against neiborghing coutries for years. \n \n \n \nI find that incredibly hard to believe, but I'd like to see what you base it on. You think that the difference between the most powerful nation on earth compared to Mexico (!) is the same as between two not fully developed nations (one of which you point out is so desperate that it is continually reliant on US $$$)!\n\n \n Pick up the latest edition of Janes. Check out US military forces and Mexican military forces, then do the same for Israel and Syria. Tehy are pretty close. It could be argued that Mexico is actually quite a bit more dangerous to the US than Syria is to israel, because Mexicos equipment is not all outdated. They actually do have some modern stuff.\n \n \n \nOddly enough you seem to argue against yourself here. You say that Syria can't pose any threat, but if Israel has only 100 troops there, this is proof that it's not a buffer zone.\n \n Buffer zones need not be under millions of men. The Sinai is a buffer zone with Egypt, even though it is an integral part of Egypt, it's not allowed to contain a certain amount of forces. Thus it is a buffer zone, with no Israeli troops in it.\n\n \n I think you need to read back through the last several posts on this thread. I don;t think you even know what you are debating here. I said that I would support Israel holding onto the Golan Heights, but in order for the agreement to be acceptable to Syria, I think that the Heights would have to be declared a demilitarized zone. You immediatly went nuts on this for some bizarre reason, spouting a bunch of nonsense about how badly israel needed to hold onto that area, and could not possibly allow it to be a DMZ. You were simply being \"Anti-Daewoo\" instead of a logical debater.\n \n \n \n \nYou can cross much of Israel in less than an hour. Hey, but let's reduce the borders even more!\n\n \n That would be right, yes, but like I said before, I don't care if they hold onto the heights or not.\n \n \n \nWe do indeed have different ideas. For limited gains, Syria can win those limited gains.\n\n \n \n Exactly what would be Syrias limited gains here? Tanks roll into desert, tanks get blown to pieces. Unless this is part of a Syrian plan to dispose of old tanks, I am not seeing any gain at all here.\n \n \n \nA classic case is Prussia under Frederick the great, a state of 3,000,000 which took on more than 100,000,000 of Russia, France and Austria-Hungry combined. It's not always numbers, and Syria, depending on what they want to gain, might seek only a limited war. I am making no assumptions about their intent. Only you are as you argue with certainty about what their plans are.\n\n \n You are right, it is not always about numbers, if it was all about numbers, Syria could take israel. It is also about equipment, supply lines, etc... Syria suimply does not have the military infrastructure to support such a move. That's all there is to it. You are arguing a point based on emotion (namely, you dislike and distrust arabs), while I am arguing a pont based on logic, it wouls simply be impossible for them to pull it off, and would likely lead to their destruction. We will most likely never see eye to eye on this one, as most of my thoguht processes lean towards the logical, and yours apparently lean towards the emotional.\n \n \n \n \nWhat do you mean after 1974, if you mean in 1982 then you have a funny way of saying 'in 1982'. Syria was part of an un-provoked attack on Israel in 1972\n\n \n Sorry, this was unclear. The last time Syria attacked Israel was 1974. They shelled the Goaln Heights. Following this, Israel signed a treaty with them (that israel did not abide by, of course). The next time israeli and Syrian forces clashed was in '82, when israel illegally invaded a neiborghing country that Syria had a mutual defense agreement with. \n \n By contrast, the last time Israel attacked Syria unprovoked was 4 months ago.\n \n \n \nPerhaps this is their objective. It therefore has some value.\n\n \n Yes, they are certainly managing to starve a lot of civilians. Lots of them are also dying from lack of medication. If this is their objective, I would fully condone nuking israel, after which we can call it \"Lake Israel\"\n \n \nThen what's your beef?\n\n \n Israel is not simply defending itself. It is an agressive, rougue nation that needs to be dealt with and CERTAINLY should not be recieving MY tax dollars to carry out their illegal acts.\n \n \n \nI think I realise now why you're here to debate. It's not that Israel has defended itself, but that it's done so successfully.\n\n \n No, it is because theya re a racist bunch of tyrants.\n \n \n \nThose nations continue to exist. You argue Israel is super-powerful, but they've not destroyed their neighbours.\n either\n a) they are not super-powerful\n or\n b) they're not as evil as you think they are\n\n \n You forgot C) israel cannot get away with it, even with American support\n \n \n \nNo kidding. Israel obviously feels like the threat is real. You don't. I wonder what your sources are, you've still yet to cite anything but your opinion about Syria's intent.\n\n \n Did you even bother taking a look at data for the Syrian and Israli militaries? Apparently not, since you are still arguing based on ignorance and emotion instead of trying to form an informed opinion on this.\n \n \n \nYou say you think a nation has a right to defend itself, but Israel need not hold the Golan Heights because Syria couldn't attack Israel anyway. You ignore the fact that they used it before to shell farming communities... regardless of Syria's ability to wage a total war then or not. Israel took the heights in retaliation for this, and now with some special insight into Syria's strategic plans for the next 20 years, you suggest that they won't attack. If I post stuff that shows otherwise, you'll just say that's anti-Syrian bias (based on your secret knowledge)\n\n \n you have yet to post anything that shows otherwise. You don't need \"secret knowledge\" in order to understand this. You simply have to take a look at publicly available data regarding both countries military strengths. Again, you are arguing from a position of absolute ignorance here.\n \n \n \nArafat is a terrorist. I suspect you won't support him going to face any court... that's right, he's not a terrorist, but a 'freedom fighter' lol\n\n \n Now you are starting to catch on.\n \n \nPartly true. The PLO doesn't claim any bit of Palestine that's part of any nation (except Israel), for like you they are anti-Israeli. They ignore their own land rights simply to illicit anti-Jewish hatred.\n\n \n If they don;t claim it, I have no reason to argue for it. Again, there is a HUGE difference between what has gone on in other arab nations and what has gone on in israel in regards to the palestenians.\n \n \nSo you would suggest that Jordan make an offer to hand land over to the Palestinians? How about compensating them for attacking them in September 1970.\n\n \n That one is kind of tough (at least the part about making reperations for the events of 1970), since that was FAR from being an unprovoked attack. If you want to look into it some more, there is a pretty decent writ up about it at http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/bravo/blacksept1970.htm I will have to think about that one a bit There are a few questions I woud need answers to before deciding.\n \n \n \n \nAh-ha, but you only speak out against Israel. What about the 3rd world nations of Africa. Parasites! lol\n\n \n I have yet to see a thread regarding any of those african nations. Start one if you like, and we can discuss them. Even the third world nations of Africa are not soley dependant on US aid for survival. We can certainly discuss them, though, I have some rather strong views on several of them, as well.\n \n \n \nWhich one? Your rant against nations dependent upon US money is brand-new and will take some time. If you mean with regards to Syria, well I don't have access to Syrian government officials like you do.\n\n \n No, it is not new. I would say I was talking about the following:\n \n \nAnd yet, you can't disprove the argument. The simple fact of the matter is that israel has done some rotten, horrible, evil things, and for some reason ther seem to be a lot of people out there who are either so stupid or so blind that they refuse to see them.

By supporting Israel, we have tied ourselves to the evil crimes they have commited. MY MONEY has been used to murder palestenian children. This bothers me. \n \n \n Are you really confused? Or just trying to dodge the bullet of having to disprove any of this stuff?\n \n \nIt seems to me that you make concessions about 'crimes' depending on who you believe is the victim. I don't hear you ranting about suicide-bombers, or people who cruise into beaches in high-powered boats to spray holiday makers with bullets.\n\n \n I don't make any concessions about \"crimes\". I don't rant about suicide bombers or other palistenian militants because I don't think they are crimianals. Yes, they kill civilians. No, i don't think that is always a crime. I haev outlined in other threads that I believe that the civilian population of a democratic nation are legitimate targets in situations where their democratically elected governments have engaged in a long term policy of wrongful behavior. If Israeli citizens wanted to right the wrongs of their government, they can vote new guys into office. As long as they continue to elect hardliners like Sharon, who is a war criminal and ran on a platform of continuing evil acts, they deserve to die.\n \n \n \nYes, you have tied yourself to Israel. I have no argument here.\n\n \n Yep, and we paid ofr it on 9.11, and we continue to pay for it. And we will keep paying for it until enough of the citizens of this democratic country have died for the rest to wake up and recognise the poor behavior of our government and make some changes.\n \n \n \nYou do, by already referring to them as 'freedom fighters'\n.\n \n Do you even read the stuff I post, or jsut the first line? Like I said, I do not turn a blind eye to it, I fully support it. You cannot fully support something if you have turned a blind eye to it. Specifically, I said:\n \n \nI certainly do not turn a blind eye to the acts of agression against Israel (which at this point is pretty much limited to the freedom fighters there). I don't tunr a blind eye to them, quite the contrary, I support them fully in their endeavor. I give thousands of dollars a year to charities that I know full well send the money back to Hamas. As an added bonus, I get to write these controbutions off when tax time rolls around. \n \n \n \n \nWhich Arab democracy do you support?\n\n \n None. Nothing would make me happier than to see the fall of the house of saud, the fall of the iranina government, and the removal of the rulers of both syria and jordan, to be replaced with democratically elected governments. Of course, I think that selling Jordan as a tyrannical state is a pretty hard sell. Democracy is no gaurantee agains tyranny, nor does a monarchy gaurantee tyranny.\n \n \nI think you're incredibly bitter about something. I find it odd that you'd be so hostile against someone promoting peace and understanding.\n\n \n UHHHHH, yes, peace and understanding like we saw during the inquisition.\n \n \n \nEven here you show your bias by calling them 'revenge attacks'. That is, they aren't actions, but re-actions against something else done to them. About time people take responsibility for their actions\n.\n \n They were revenge attacks. Maybe you don;t like them, but they weredone for the purpose of revenge. This does not make them right or wrong, they simply were revenge attacks. \n \n \n \nReally? Then who is it that's blowing up Israeli buses? See even here you recognise that a smaller number, a smaller force will challenge a larger more powerful force, if they think the gains are worth it. You argue against yourself\n\n \n I think maybe we should quite debating if you are really having trouble with this concept. If you cannot understand this one, you are most likely not bright enough to uderstand others (which owuld explainsome of your views).\n \n I did not say a smaller force would not challenge a more powerful, larger force. I said they would not if their destruction and defeat were assured.\n \n I have a funny feeling you are not really this stupid, and you are simply trying to twist my words for some odd reason.",
