   "I have been researching this extensively in the recent past. The previous poster is correct. In most U.S. states, it is a crime online or offline to harrass an individual. Granted, not every state has the correct laws to cover it. My research found that roughly 1/3 of states do not have proper laws to address electronic communication harrassment. Your post stated that the individual made threats though. The police should be able to press charges against him with valid proof. \n \n The situation I face is quite different. I volunteer my time at a website and we have a \"live chat\" feature. A certain individual harrasses everyone present. I have contacted authorities in his hometown. The officer I spoke with even witnessed this subject from the police station via a PD computer harrassing various users on our site. They are working on it as I speak. This person is brave enough to post his contact information when he is confronted about his actions. This individual has a website that mentions Hitler and extensive slander against internet users he crosses paths with. Quite disturbing actually. I will post any further information I can gather pertaining to this frighteningly-common and ever-growing dire issue across the world.\n \n Here is an excerpt of a case and consequences from South Carolina.\n \n NAME OF SUBJECT REMOVED, 38, of Columbia, South Carolina, was sentenced to 5 years of probation, 500 hours of community service, and more than $12,000 in restitution today for two counts of Use of a Telecommunications Device (the internet) with Intent to Annoy, Abuse, Threaten or Harass. That subject had to pay that city for the officers who investigated the case even. \n \n So yes, he sent a few emails and got charged lightly upon request by the victim. If he had made death threats, the charges would have been much more severe.",

   "I didn't have problems with harrassment but I was overrun with spam. Finally, I had to dump my e-mail address and do not give it out easily. I have eight addresses through Earthlink and I can move to any of the others and delete the old one which would cause the e-mail to bounce back to the originator. You can't really unsubscribe because that only verifies that it is a good address so all you can do is to delete the file but when they pour in by the 10's or even hundreds it is overwhelming. I finally had to bite the bullet to put a stop to it. So far (about three months) so good. \n \n A friend of mine uses only a temporary e-mail address and then deletes it. In the last day or so I read that people are now using temporary credit card numbers to protect themselves. I don't offhand know how this is done but until they start locking these creeps up like the common criminals they are this will continue to plague the internet.\n \n If anyone knows about this problem it would be Strel.
