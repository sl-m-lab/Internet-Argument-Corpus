   "Some people argue that with one supreame superpower in the world there would be peace and stabillity. Often refering to the Roman Empire as the only period of time with continious peace. This often to justify USA's role as the master of the all the other slaves and puppets. \n \n However the Roman Empire did not cause peace, it actually constantly raged in wars with nabour countries to expand and/or maintain its power.\n \n Nor do USA keep the world in peace, as only themselves has not experienced a year of peace since it's foundation. Going into and out(less) from wars or \"armed conflicts\" all over the world, while aggressing to many more. \n \n Say that USA once would defeat all it's enemies and there wouldn't be any left to fight, would that make it a fair overlord of the others or just the single state of the world? Or like the Roman Empire run most by slaves, and later fall apart from the inside and increased resistance by outsiders. \n \n Does single superpower \"peace\" work?",
