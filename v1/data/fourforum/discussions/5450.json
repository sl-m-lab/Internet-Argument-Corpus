   "I thought this was an interesting comparison between these two major religions. I'm not sure of the original author but I believe the statements are factual.\n ============================\n Mohammed v. Jesus\n \n Mohammed was the prophet of war; Christ is the Prince of Peace (Isaiah 9:6-7).\n \n Mohammed's disciples killed for the faith; Christ's disciples were killed for their faith (Acts 12:2; 2 Timothy 4:7).\n \n Mohammed promoted persecution against the \"infidels\"; Christ forgave and converted the chief persecutor (1 Timothy 1:13-15).\n \n Mohammed was the taker of life; Christ was the giver of life (John 10:27-28).\n \n Mohammed and his fellow warriors murdered thousands; Christ murdered none but saved many (compare John 12:48).\n \n Mohammed's method was COMPULSION; Christ's aim was voluntary CONVERSION (Acts 3:19).\n \n Mohammed practiced FORCE; Christ preached FAITH (John 6:29, 35).\n \n Mohammed was a WARRIOR; Christ is a DELIVERER (Col. 1:13; 1 Thessalonians 1:10).\n \n Mohammed conquered his enemies with the sword; Christ conquered his enemies with another kind of sword, the sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God (Hebrews 4:12; Acts 2:37).\n \n Mohammed said to the masses, \"Convert or die!\"; Christ said, \"Believe and live!\" (John 6:47; 11:25-26).\n \n Mohammed was swift to shed blood (Romans 3:15-17); Christ shed His own blood for the salvation of many (Ephesians 1:7).\n \n Mohammed preached \"Death to the infidels!\"; Christ prayed \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do\" (Luke 23:34).\n \n Mohammed declared a holy war (Jihad) against infidels; Christ achieved a holy victory on Calvary's cross (Colossians 2:14-15) and His followers share in that victory (John 16:33).\n \n Mohammed constrained people by conquest; Christ constrained people by love (2 Corinthians 5:14).\n \n Modern terrorists derive their inspiration from Mohammed and carry out their despicable atrocities in the name of his god; Christians derive their inspiration from the One who said, \"Blessed are the peacemakers\" (Matthew 5:9).\n \n Modern day disciples of Mohammed respond to the terrorist attacks by cheering in the streets; Modern day disciples of Christ are deeply grieved at past atrocities carried out by those who were \"Christians\" in name only (the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, etc.).\n \n Many Muslims are peaceful and peace-loving because they do not strictly follow the teachings of their founder; Many Christians are peaceful and peace-loving because they do strictly follow the teachings of their Founder (Romans 12:17-21).\n \n Mohammed said the Koran is authoritative only in Arabic, and only in his dialect; The Bible is authoritative in many languages around the world, for God knows all things and can inspire (and preserve) His Word in more than one language.\n \n Mohammed hated music; Jesus and His disciples sang hymns, and the Apostle commanded the Lord's Church to sing. (Matthew 26:30, Ephesians 5:19, Colossians 3:16).\n \n Mohammed allowed that a Mullah, Imam, or Mufti of Islam can be a terrorist and an amoral animal like Osama bin Laden; The Bible requires that a leader in the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ must be above reproach, and when this is not true, Christians demand such a fallen leader be removed from leadership. (1 Timothy 3:1-7, 5:19-20).\n \n Islam calls on its followers to observe Five Pillars, while all other aspects of life can be vulgar and not affect the Muslim's prospects in Paradise. The Bible calls on the Christian to submit to the total change of his life by the Spirit of God -- NO area of life and thought is the choice of the follower. (Romans 12:1-2).\n \n The Muslim looks forward to eternity in Paradise where there will be virgins who are used for eternal perpetual copulation.\n \n The Bible believing Christian looks forward to being with Jesus Christ and is delighted with that. (2 Corinthians 5:8).\n \n Mohammed said the witness of a woman was half the value of the witness of a man; and Muhammed said a woman goes to Paradise because she satisfies her husband sexually; The Bible teaches that a husband is to love his wife and be willing to die for her. (Ephesians 5:25).\n \n Mohammed called upon his servants to fight; Jesus said, \"My kingdom is not of this world; if My kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight . . . but now is My kingdom not from hence\" (John 18:36).\n \n Mohammed ordered death to the Jews (see A. Guillaume, The Life of Muhammad, Oxford University Press [1975], p. 369); Christ ordered that the gospel be preached \"to the Jew first\" (Romans 1:16).\n \n The Koran says, \"Fight in the cause of Allah\" (Qu'ran 2.244); The Bible says, \"we wrestle not against flesh and blood\" and \"the weapons of our warfare are not carnal\" (Ephesians 6:12; 2 Corinthians 10:4).\n \n The Koran says, \"Fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them\" (Qu'ran 9.5); Christ said, \"Preach the gospel to every creature\" (Mark 16:15).\n \n The Koran says, \"I will inspire terror into the hearts of unbelievers\" (Qu'ran 8.12); God inspires His terror into the hearts of believers (Isaiah 8:13).\n \n The Koran (Qu'ran) is a terrorist manual which condones fighting, conflict, terror, slaughter, and genocide against those who do not accept Islam; The Bible is a missionary manual to spread the gospel of peace to all the world (Romans 10:15).\n \n Mohammed's Mission was to conquer the world for Allah; Christ's mission was to conquer sin's penalty and power by substitutionary atonement (2 Corinthians 5:21; 1 Peter 3:18).\n \n Mohammed considered Christ a good prophet; Christ pronounced (in His statement on many false prophets arising) Mohammed to be a false prophet (John 10:10; Matthew 24:11).\n \n Mohammed claimed that there was but one God, Allah; Christ claimed that He was God (John 10:30-31; John 8:58-59; John 5:18; John 14:9).\n \n Islam is geocentric, that is, the whole universe is centered on the Kaaba in the Grand Mosque in Mecca in Arabia, and all Muslims pray facing that direction; Jesus Christ is the center of all Christian worship and fellowship, for He is \"in the midst\" where his saints meet anywhere on earth. (Matthew 18:20, John 4:22-23).\n \n Mohammed's Tomb: OCCUPIED! Christ's tomb: EMPTY!\n \n Islam must be received, or you can be killed for rejecting it:\n \n The Faith offered by Jesus Christ is for \"whosoever will\" to receive, and all men are permitted to reject it. (Revelation 22:17, John 3:16).\n \n Those who leave Islam are killed in most Islamic nations; Those who leave the true Church of Jesus Christ are allowed to do so with no revenge.",

   "Jesus WAS a pacifist? Then why is he quoted as saying 'I come not for peace, but with a sword'?? That doesn't sound like a pacifist to me.\n\n \n That's an excellent question and I've puzzled over that myself everytime I happen to read or hear it. As best as I can understand it Jesus meant to imply that he was against the complacency and hypocricy that existed in the official religious circles of the Pharisees and Saducees who gave the marching orders to the faithful. He went into the temple and threw out the money changers and the like also. That period of time was a time of turmoil and unrest. He was a revolutionary of sorts regardless of whether one believes him to be divine. But he certainly never believed or taught that his followers should go about murdering and pillaging others in the pursue of spreading his gospels. His words say quite the opposite. Compare that to Mohammad who ordered his followers to smite the heads of the infidels and who personally supervised the beheadings of hundreds during his time on earth at Medina. This is an excerpt from a Muslim cite regarding that event. Hard to believe but this is what he wrote to justify these beheadings.\n \n But it does not mean that he did not love the Jews. The beheading of at least 600 of them does not mean that the Prophet had ordered them killed out of his hatred towards them. In fact, he resorted to this tactic to instill love in the hearts of those Jews who survived. They recognized the Prophet's noble gesture and reciprocated it by extending their support to their Muslim rulers. \n \n http://www.mukto-mona.com/Articles/asghar/muslim_jews.htm",

But, when reports came out during the rescue operation during that event and it was reported that people were jumping/falling to their deaths, I really didn't want to see such a thing at that moment shown on live TV.\n Unfortunatly, the ONLY channel I recall actually seeing something I considered extremely distateful was on a Christian TV channel.\n \n As a news monitor, I find (as do many people) that most news is pretty depressing and at times graphic however, I have noticed that it seems that the conservative channels like Fox often are more so than the lefty medias.\n Maybe others will disagree.\n \n This isn't a lefy attack by moi against the right, I get called fascist and as even Jo will attest, am pretty conservative on most issues. Just an observation.\n So, if you being a righty tend to watch news stations that you agree with and end up seeing an excessive amount of 'Yippy, America is getting what it deserved!11!' it doesn't mean it's indicative of the whole.\n \n I also seem to recall that some of the initial stories about ME people yipping for joy turned out to have been distorted or proven to have been false.\n \n \n As was said, watching some rabble rousers on TV burning the flag isn't an indication that all Americans are like that. Nor is watching the KKK march an indication that all christians are like that or a group of minorities marching to protest a police officer shooting a criminal an indication of how all minorities think. If such were the case, the mythical Muslim street would have been something unified and all pervasive on the TV from day one of the Iraqi conflict.\n \n I'm sure you MM have all sorts of sympathies that you can identify with but would stop far short of actually acting on them. So, if one million Muslims are fanatics and 10 million consciously support them and another 50 million think the militants have a valid point but would not render aid that still leaves over 900 million who would rather keep their heads low and go on with their lives as best they can.\n\n \n Actually, I watch many different news sources and followed those up by my own additional research to ferret out the facts. I am satisfied that there was great sympathy directed to the terrorists for what they did to America on 9/11. I watched Chris Matthews (Hardball) attempting to get some kind of explanation from a Muslim cleric. It was like pulling teeth. I remember discussing this on the internet and as you will recall there was a very long time before most Muslims would even admit that bin Laden directed this terrorism. \n \n There are substantial numbers of Americans who do not believe that Muslims should even be permitted to enter the United States. I talked to some just tonight. I wouldn't go that far but I would not permit anyone to come here either as a visitor or as a permanent resident to ally themselves or sympathize with terrorists. We can and should deport them immediately.\n \n BTW, the KKK is effectively a dead organization. The members can probably be counted on one hand and has been totally discredited. Islam on the other hand is growing like a malignant cancer and cannot be seen to be comparable in any way. And the KKK never at any time threatened to undermine the foundations of our way of life. Militant Islam fully intends to destroy it completely. They have said so. I tend to take them at their word.",

(Colossians 3:22 NAB)\n \n Wives, be subordinate to your husbands, as is proper in the Lord. (Colossians 3:18 NAB)\n \n So this is what the LORD Almighty says about them: \"I will punish them! Their young men will die in battle, and their little boys and girls will starve. Not one of these plotters from Anathoth will survive, for I will bring disaster upon them when their time of punishment comes.\" (Jeremiah 11:22-23 NLT)\n \n \"They were my brothers!\" Gideon exclaimed. \"As surely as the LORD lives, I wouldn't kill you if you hadn't killed them.\" Turning to Jether, his oldest son, he said, \"Kill them!\" But Jether did not draw his sword, for he was only a boy and was afraid. Then Zebah and Zalmunna said to Gideon, \"Don't ask a boy to do a man's job! Do it yourself!\" So Gideon killed them both and took the royal ornaments from the necks of their camels. (Judges 8:19-21 NLT)\n \n Withhold not chastisement from a boy; if you beat him with a rod he will not die. Beat him with the rod, and you will save him from the nether world. (Proverbs 23:13-14 NAB)\n \n By words no servant can be trained; for he understands what is said, but obeys not. (Proverbs 29:19 NAB)\n \n When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are. If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again. But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her. And if the slave girl's owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter. If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife. If he fails in any of these three ways, she may leave as a free woman without making any payment. (Exodus 21:7-11 NLT)\n \n Damn that Christianity is one evil religion. emoticon_rolleyes",

The fact remains that the god described in the OT is cruel, capricious and a tyrant. (Plenty of chapters and verses available on request, but it's well-worn ground.)\n\n \n If I may, JohnHanks, I have read this often, about the god of the old testament being cruel and capricious. If we use the old testament, which you are using, as the background and the arbiter of information, then the old testament describes God as the one who defines what is good and what is not good. (Genesis chapters 1-3). Additionally, the fall of man was that man wanted to be god even though he was not god. He acted like God with out knowledge by determining in his own self what is good and evil. \n \n Therefore, God is the only one who can determine good and evil. For you to judge God is like your two year old judging you as evil when you punish them for getting too near the fire or playing in traffic.\n \n That is, if you want to be consistent in your logic and use the old testament as reference. If we continue along the same vein and say that the bible is the reference, the God is Good by definition and everything he does is good, by definition. NOw, with that said, one can wonder as to why God would cause or allow such things as bears eating children. That is a legitimate question. One that should be wrestled with, but be assured that you do not and will not know the answer unless God himself tells you. After all, he is far greater than you.\n \n Likely as not, you don't believe in God. And you intention was not to be consistent in your logic but rather to prove your point. Fine. This is a debate board. But, given that, then it is legitimate to argue that your logic is inconsistent. It is okay to say that you don't like the god in the bible, but, it does not prove he does not exist. It is not okay to say you don't like the god in the bible and then to forever decide that you do not wish to know him because you do not understand some things. \n \n You issue a question that is truly unanswerable by humans. It is unanswerable because, 1. I cannot ever KNOW WHY another has done something unless they tell me directly. 2)Humans are finite and God is infinite, 3)For man to judge God is a reversal of roles that is described in the book of Genesis, and finally 4)For man to determine something good or evil based on his own subjective experience is subjective and by definition prejudicial and therefore falls as a logical argument.\n \n I hope I have been clear. It can be a messy topic. One thing I do know is that God demonstrated His love for man in that he came in the form of man, and laid down his life for those who hated him that he might show his love towards them. I know that God is good and is Love by this alone. Given that, I look at the rest of the scripture and interpret it through that. I amy not understand everything, but then I am not God.\n \n Have a good one\n \n EF",

   "The bible explicitly says God created evil. How can something that is 'only good' create evil?\n\n \n Did God create evil? \n \n If we believe that God created a perfect world and He is sovereign, where did evil come from? There are some people who believe that His sovereign control includes the creation of evil, and they base their conclusion on the words of Isaiah 45:7. In that verse, God says, \"I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil\" (KJV). \n \n In order to understand what God was saying through the prophet Isaiah, we need to look at the words used in the text of Isaiah 45:7 . Hebrew words often have a wide variety of meanings, depending on the immediate context in which the word is used. The job of the translator is to accurately select the best modern English word that is closest to the meaning of the word used in the original Hebrew manuscripts. \n \n The fact that different English translations use different words for the Hebrew word ra'The fact that ra' is contrasted to shalom, the Hebrew word for peace, helps to give parameters to the meaning of ra'. Shalom, again, is a rich word with broad meaning. Depending on the context, shalom can be translated \"peace,\" \"well-being,\" \"welfare,\" \"prosperity,\" \"safe,\" \"health,\" and \"peaceable.\" in Isaiah 45:7 makes it evident that different translators interpreted the context of Isaiah 45 in different ways. Five different English translations are compared below. \n \n I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things (KJV). \n I form the light, and create darkness, I make peace, and create calamity; I, the Lord, do all these things (NKJV). \n I form the light and create darkness, I bring prosperity and create disaster; I, the Lord, do all these things (NIV). \n The One forming light and creating darkness, causing well-being and creating calamity; I am the Lord who does all these (NASB). \n I form light and create darkness, I make weal and create woe, I am the Lord, who does all these things (RSV). \n \n The Hebrew term ra' has a broad spectrum of meanings. It can mean \"wickedness,\" \"mischief,\" \"bad,\" \"trouble,\" \"hurt,\" \"sore,\" \"affliction,\" \"ill,\" \"adversity,\" \"harm,\" \"grievous,\" and \"sad.\" Thus, as with the interpretation of any word, it is the immediate context that dictates the exact nuance of the word to be translated into English. \n \n The fact that ra' is contrasted to shalom, the Hebrew word for peace, helps to give parameters to the meaning of ra'. Shalom, again, is a rich word with broad meaning. Depending on the context, shalom can be translated \"peace,\" \"well-being,\" \"welfare,\" \"prosperity,\" \"safe,\" \"health,\" and \"peaceable.\" \n \n The context of Isaiah 45:7 is a profound declaration of God's total sovereignty over the affairs of men. God's stunning revelation that Cyrus, the totalitarian ruler of Persia, was being chosen by Him to be \"His anointed\" ( Isaiah 45:1 ), the deliverer of the nation of Israel, was shocking to Isaiah's readers. This is especially true given God's clear denunciation of idolatry in the immediately preceding context ( Isaiah 44:6-23 ). The irony of this passage is that God reveals how He intends to use a pagan, idol-worshiping dictator like Cyrus to return His people Israel to the land from which they had been deposed by the Babylonian despot, Nebuchadnezzar. \n \n In summing up the gamut of His awesome character and unpredictable ways (see also Isaiah 55:8-9 ), God declares: \n \n I am the Lord, and there is no other; apart from Me there is no God. I will strengthen you, though you have not acknowledged Me, so that from the rising of the sun to the place of its setting men may know there is none besides Me. I am the Lord, and there is no other. I form the light and create darkness, I bring prosperity and create disaster; I, the Lord, do all these things (Isaiah 45:5-7 NIV). Only He can take the most wicked, evil, and self-serving intentions and make good come out of them (see also Romans 8:28 ).\n \n Does God create evil? Certainly not. If He was the author of evil, then He certainly would not be a good God that is worthy of worship and praise, much less trusted to have our well-being in mind. The idea of a good God creating His own enemy and the object of His wrath seems inconceivable. It would be inconsistent for a good God to mastermind the idea of evil, will it into existence, and still be considered a good God. \n \n Rather, God created man in His image with the freedom to choose. With this freedom came the opportunity to rebel against Him. Man did rebel ( Genesis 3 ), and the rest is history. The annals of human history chronicle how God uses everything- even the chaos of this world- to bring about His glory and purposes. And he created calamity for those who practice evil, so that a man can reap what he sows (sows evil, reaps evil).  (rbc.org)",

God did create \"the possibility\" of evil. There had to be that otherwise there would be no good. The question arose if god created evil how can he be good. The point is as stated before. God is good and only does good, therefore whatever god does MUST be good including the creation of the possibility of evil. To question whether or not it is good to have created evil places a human in the judgement seat over God.

The majority view of the Rabbis is that punishment in Gehenna is of limited duratation. The maximum punishment was believed to be 12 months. The Talmud says,in tractate \"Shabbat\" page 33b that \"The duration of punishment in Gehenna is twelve months\". This is also stated in both early and late rabbinical literature (ie, texts of the Rabbis of the Talmud). This 12 month limit is true for both Jewish and Gentile sinners (\"Rosh HaShanah\" 17a). This is true even of the generation of the flood, who were said to be very wicked. (Mishneh, Eduyyot 2:10; Genesis Rabbah 28:8). Though some individual Rabbis (a minority) expressed the view that certain sinners stayed in Gehenna forever, it was not the majority, accepted view.\n \n \"During the twelve-month period in Gehenna, the soul goes through a process of purification and atonement, and, as described in Midrash Pesikta Rabbati, 'After going down to Gehenna and receiving the punishment due him, the sinner is forgiven from all his iniquities, like an arrow from the bow he is flung forth from Gehenna' (Pesikta Rabbati 53:2).

   "If we use the old testament, which you are using, as the background and the arbiter of information, then the old testament describes God as the one who defines what is good and what is not good.

It is not okay to say you don't like the god in the bible and then to forever decide that you do not wish to know him because you do not understand some things.\n\n \n With respect, you're the one being inconsistent. I never claimed to have proved god doesn't exist, though you're right in assuming I don't believe it does.

Indeed, the Bible makes it clear that existence ends with death. In the Book of Genesis we read, \"Dust you are and to dust shall you return\" without any concomitant assurance that anything comes after death.\"In respect of the fate of man and fate of beast, they have one and the same fate... Both go to the same place; both came from dust and both return to dust,\" opines Kohelet (Ecclesiastes 3:19-20). So, too, do we read: \"We must all die; we are like water that is poured out on the ground and cannot be gathered up (II Samuel 14:14). During the biblical period, Jews believed that after death one goes down into a pit called Sheol. According to Numbers 16:30 (also Ezekiel 31:14, Psalm 88:7 and Lamentations 3:55) it is below the earth. According to Jonah 2:7 it is at the base of a high mountain. According to Job 26:5 it is beneath the waters. Psalm 88:13 understands it to be a place of darkness (so, too, Job 10:21, 22) and Psalm 115:17 considers it a place of silence. The prophet Isaiah envisioned it enclosed by barred gates (Isaiah 38:10; so too Job 38:17). Psalm 115 confirms that \"The dead cannot praise the Lord, nor any who go down into silence\" (verse 17). Psalm 88 provides this graphic description of death as the end of all existence:\n \n\n http://www.scheinerman.net/judaism/ideas/afterlife.html\n \n And, if you bothered to read what you cut/paste .. gehennea , while taken as hell, is actually different.. \n \n ALso, the jewish concept of hell is DIFFEENT than the eternal suffering that the christians spew forth. If you noticed, like I said before, the suffering goes for UP TO TWELVE MONTHS... that isn't your 'burn in hell forever' thelogy.\n \n Your cut/pastes actually demonstrated what I have been saying.",

If you are going to cut/paste from somewhere, you should at least provide a link, so it can be read in context, and so the reliablity of the source can be checked. Very poor of you. Let's look a a jewish concept of what that passage is. \n \n Well, you know.. let us look at that.. from \n http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/economic/friedman/SatanHumor.htm\n \n \n \n\n Satan, condemned in Christianity as a fallen angel, as evil incarnate, is a more complex figure in Judaism, where he originated. Satan is the angel who is constantly carping and who causes people to transgress the will of God. He is the angel that accused Joshua, the High Priest, of misdeeds before God (Zechariah 3:1) and who instigated David to sin by taking a census of Israel (I Chronicles 21:1). In Job (1:7), Satan is introduced as the angel who has come from \"going to and fro on the earth, and from walking in it.\" Satan diligently but unsuccessfully tried to get Job to blaspheme the Lord.\n \n The Jewish written law is contained in the Pentateuch (the Five Books of Moses, i.e., the Torah). The Talmud is the compilation of Jewish oral law, consisting of the mishna, compiled and redacted by Rabbi Yehuda Hanasi, known as Rebbi, about the year 189 C.E.; and the gemara, commentaries and discussions on the mishna put into written form about 1500 years ago. The oral law elaborates on the written law.\n \n The Talmud is mainly concerned with halacha (Jewish law) but also provides a detailed record of the beliefs of the Jewish people, their philosophy, traditions, culture, and folklore, i.e., the aggadah (homiletics). The Midrash, a separate scripture, recorded the views of the Talmudic sages and is mainly devoted to the exposition of Biblical verses.\n \n Z. H. Chajes stated that the aim of the homiletic portion of the Talmud and Midrash was firstly to inspire people to serve the Lord and, secondly, to make certain that the audience paid attention. Maimonides felt that there were hidden inner meanings in the stories, riddles, parables, etc. used in aggadah. Clearly, many of the stories told in the Talmud and Midrash were not necessarily meant to be taken literally. But they have had a profound influence on Jewish thought and philosophy, and even on latter-day Hassidic stories.\n \n The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how Satan appears in millennia-old tales from the aggadah (homiletics), as a formidable but sometimes defeatable figure, intent on manipulating mortals into sin, and teaching the public important and, often, poignant lessons about life. Satan is used as an archetype, often in a somewhat humorous manner, not unlike the fox fables and trickster tales. In fact, of all the trickster figures in the folktales of various diverse cultures -- e.g., the Native American Coyote, the African Trickster Rabbit, the Greek god Hermes, the Norse god Loki -- Satan is probably the oldest.\n \n \n In the Hebrew scriptures, Satan is not a fallen angel. He is not an evil force equal and opposite to God; in fact, he is merely another angel, obedient and subservient to God. The literal meaning of the Hebrew word satan is \"accuser\" or \"adversary,\" a word that connotes the angel's task as prosecutor in the Heavenly court. It is interesting to note that the word Devil, a synonym for Satan, is derived from a corruption of the Greek word diabolos, meaning \"slanderer\" which may have been derived from the Hebrew.\n \n \n\n \n And, a short comment about that passage from http://www.torah.org/learning/pirkei-avos/chapter2-5b.html\n \n \n\n \n The idea behind this simply, is that we can never relax in our service of G-d. We have never just \"made it\" and are free to bask in our triumph over the challenges of life. The Talmud writes that every day a man's \"evil inclination\" gains strength and attempts to overpower him -- and would do just that if not for G-d's Divine assistance (Sukkah 52b). The fact that we've served G-d so well yesterday is no assurance that we'll do the same tomorrow. New challenges always come our way -- as well as old ones which have never really been fully put to rest. We might simply be caught off our guard after so many years of religious service. We might not recognize the new challenges which come along, nor will we necessarily know how to battle them. It is a known phenomenon that sometimes in less traditional families the parents are more wise of the ways of the world and better know how to protect their children from negative influences than more strictly traditional families who just have no idea what hit them. There are drug problems in the Orthodox world -- as well as \"internet\" problems (let's just call them that). Nothing is certain in life. We might have the greatest track record in the world, but sometimes the slightest temptation which catches us off-balance might make the entire edifice come tumbling down.\n \n",

I would say you are correct in part. I would actually say that christians place far more emphasis on Satan than they ought. I don't think the scripture actually does. There are about as many references in the NT as the old. (roughly).\n \n I think the source posted by Trebor does not define Satan any differently than does christian scripture (different christians are a different story). I think there has been such a fascination with the \"beast\" in The book of the revelation that people get going far further than they ought.\n \n Satan, in my opinion, is real and his tactics should be noted. This allows christians to apply the antidote at the appropriate time. Paul, in Ephesians talks about \"the armor\" of god and this is a good answer to those \"tricks of the trickster.\"\n \n Christianity sees Satan as a fallen angel, the source cited by Trebor does as well. Chrisitanity sees him as the accuser, so does the source cited by Trebor. Christianity sees Satan as the tempter of the righteous, so does the source cited by Trebor.\n \n My issue is that Trebor's claims are that christians project something onto judaism that is not there. I disagree for reasons previously stated.\n \n I did not post my sources earlier, that was an error on my part, but they are easy enough to find. They show up in the first google seach that does \"satan\" \"judaism\" and through the first page there are a number of links including the sources cited by Trebor. It isn't hard. I hid nothing and the implication by Trebor is that I did.\n \n I appreciate your comments Orion. I think folks would be hard put to show that I make antisemitic comments.\n \n It would be an easy thing to show the stereotypical and prejudical comments of trebor against, at a minimum, christians. Funny how tolerance is so important until one is called upon to show it for a group they dislike.\n \n Thanks again Orion.

I think there has been such a fascination with the \"beast\" in The book of the revelation that people get going far further than they ought.\n \n Satan, in my opinion, is real and his tactics should be noted. This allows christians to apply the antidote at the appropriate time. Paul, in Ephesians talks about \"the armor\" of god and this is a good answer to those \"tricks of the trickster.\"\n \n Christianity sees Satan as a fallen angel, the source cited by Trebor does as well. Chrisitanity sees him as the accuser, so does the source cited by Trebor. Christianity sees Satan as the tempter of the righteous, so does the source cited by Trebor.\n \n My issue is that Trebor's claims are that christians project something onto judaism that is not there. I disagree for reasons previously stated.\n \n I did not post my sources earlier, that was an error on my part, but they are easy enough to find. They show up in the first google seach that does \"satan\" \"judaism\" and through the first page there are a number of links including the sources cited by Trebor. It isn't hard. I hid nothing and the implication by Trebor is that I did.\n \n I appreciate your comments Orion. I think folks would be hard put to show that I make antisemitic comments.\n \n It would be an easy thing to show the stereotypical and prejudical comments of trebor against, at a minimum, christians. Funny how tolerance is so important until one is called upon to show it for a group they dislike.\n \n Thanks again Orion. I have frequently enjoyed our debates although they may have been heated at times (I hope not, but I have a lot of posts and I am not always perfect in behavior).\n \n EF\n\n \n \n You are incorrect. The sources I cited DO NOT TAKE SATAN AS A FALLEN ANGEL<< READ THE SOURCES.\n \n In Jewish Mythology, Satan has the job, assigned to him by god, to present the opportunities for bad choices. It is more like an imp of hte perverse, rather than a free willed fallen angel demigod that the Christians have.\n \n For example (and please READ IT THIS TIME)\n \n http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/06-Jewish-Thought/section-36.html\n \n \n\n Judaism does not believe in the devil, but we do believe in Satan (who\n more properly should be called \"the Satan\"). As this demonstrates, the\n Jewish view of Satan is very different than the Christian one. Here's\n a summary of the Jewish view; you can also find information at Alyza\n (Gretchen) Shapiro's web site at\n [5]http://www.cyberdrive.net/%7Ealyza/Jewish/satan.html\n \n The word satan means challenger. With the leading ha- to make haSatan,\n it refers to /the/ challenger. This describes Satan as the angel who\n is the embodiment of man's challenges. Satan works for G-d. His job is\n to make choosing good over evil enough of a challenge so that it can\n be a meaningful choice. Contrast this to Christianity, which sees\n Satan as God's opponent. In Jewish thought, the idea that there exists\n anything capable of setting itself up as God's opponent would be\n considered overly polytheistic--you are setting up the devil to be a\n god or demigod.\n \n",

   "I have already answered trebor's arguments. The fallen angel stance is one well attributed to earlier jewish testimonies that predate christianity. I think that point is long since won.\n \n Another is this insistence that we cannot use the new testament as it promotes a uniquely christian viewpoint. That would be true if the majority of the NT was not written by devout Jews.\n \n Paul in particular was a pharisee and was extremely well versed in the law and indeed all of jewish tradition. He makes it clear who satan is and he also refers to satan's demise and to satan as the serpent. Paul makes references to Isaiah, Genesis, amongst others. Paul would not have had any such christian indoctrination to spout. His statements come from his own personal knowledge. \n \n Secondly, James was also a devout Jew and describes satan as a lion waiting to devour. John and Jesus were both jews. Jesus spoke of satan in a personal manner as did the pharisees who opposed Him. There is a clear discussion between jesus and the pharisees about whose authority jesus has to cast out demons. The pharisees treat Satan as a person in a hierarchy over demons. Their viewpoint was distinctly jewish.\n \n Now you may try to argue that the new testament books are not valid for history, but that would be off topic and on to another debate. Given that you are in acceptance of the pentateuch as reliable, you must accept documentation that post date those books as being closer in history to our own record. In addition their is ample Papyrolgical evidence to show that the New Testament documents we have are closest in time to their actual writing of any document ever. (See APIS for objective verification).\n \n Trebor: Your logic is just not present. You have never touched the argument that current jewish traditions are a reaction to christianity given that their concepts of satan were clearly documented differently prior to christianity. It is an easy exercise to prove this. \n \n EF\n \n Please, please, please, provide logical analysis of the arguments rather than referring to stereotypical comments. It only shows you to be wrong and desparate to win.\n \n EF",

   "Earlier, I had briefly touched upon the relationship between God and Satan as described in the book of Job. I discovered another instance in Num. 22, wherein God becomes displeased with an individual named Balaam and sends an angel against him...\n \n Num. 22:22 And God's anger was kindled because he (Balaam) went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him.\n \n The Hebrew word satan, as you know, translates to \"accuser\" or \"adversary\". But it's interesting to note that in this instance as well, the satan is acting on God's behalf.\n \n The Harper Collins Bible Dictionary has this to say about the Satan of the OT...\n \n In the first two instances (Job 1-2; Zech. 3:1-2), Satan is depicted as a member of God&#8217;s court whose basic duty it was to &#8216;accuse&#8217; human beings before God. He is clearly not at this point an enemy of God and the leader of the demonic forces of evil, as he becomes later. There is some question as to whether, in 1 Chron. 21:1, a specific personality is being described as in Job and Zechariah, or whether the &#8216;adversary&#8217; is to be understood here as a general tendency toward evil. In either case, the figure in 1 Chronicles is not yet the embodiment of evil.\n \n It is during the late postexilic period (after ca. 200 b.c.) and in the intertestamental literature that one first finds the development of the idea of Satan that is assumed in the nt writings. Probably under the influence of Persian ideology, there developed in Hebrew thought the idea of a dualism rampant in the created order&#8212;a dualism of good versus evil. There existed already the idea that God had a heavenly host, a group of messengers to carry out his work and orders. The Persians also believed in a ruler over the powers of evil, who had many servants in this realm known as demons. The Hebrews could easily understand and assimilate such thinking into their already existing ideas, but they had not yet developed any idea of a major being as a leader of the forces of evil.",
