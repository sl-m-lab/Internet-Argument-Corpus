   "The road to stability in the Middle East may be bumping for Israel.... meaning its downgrading. As for aid from USA....They say USA is just another Israel. If it were so Gore would never have failed his presidential bid! Don't delude yourself! That's another myth invented by sophisticated American spin-doctors. We have been and we are going to be for ever in the subordinate role relating America. That's unpleasant piece of truth and it's not the last. \n Well, I'm rather interested in for how long America'll let Israel preserve its present status of one of political majors in the region. For smb has already given birth to the idea of the Middle East Union (MEU) in the region. I am under strong suspicion it was USA. It'd be kind of EU in the region acting under America watchful gaze. It would be instrumental in solving long-standing Israeli dispute with Palestinians as well. \n But... but they say Turkey not Israel will be the queen bee there. Turkey with her most mighty army in the region deserves the right due to its special relationship with USA in NATO. Israel is too 'notorious' to suit the position. Thus the role of Israel will be diminished in this Union. With our one of the biggest in the region GDP milking cow at best, we're are going to be for Lebanon and others with lagging economics.",
