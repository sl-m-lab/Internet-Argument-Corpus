   "Those Who Abort Them Know Otherwise.\n \n I posted this on Youdebate, but as this is becoming more popular, I'll post it here too.\n \n ---\n Some people call an early concieved baby just a fetus or bunch of cells early on. That is their view.\n \n But this question makes me wonder if they don't say this just to ease their conscience. \"If it is just a bunch of cells, why do they abort it?\"\n \n I think some people will agree that the fetus is a living thing. But I have never heard of a couple who didn't want a baby look at it and say: \"Oh, it is really just a bunch of cells. Why not wait a while before it starts looking like an actual human just to make sure?\"\n \n This one particular arguement infuriates me. If they're going to abort the baby, I say go ahead. But don't start calling a little child not a human being. The woman knows darn well it is a human being and that is why she has it aborted.\n \n The little children are the future of america. Well they don't have much future if they can't even get the respective title of \"Human Being\" just because they're young. I've seen aborted babies at just six weeks and they look an awful lot like a regular baby. Just a ton smaller.\n \n Every person reading this post (including you ;-) ) was a baby just like that thing. You were just as much alive then as you are now. If you truly weren't living, than how do you explain yourself now? Life doesn't come from non-organic material.\n \n I've smiled before because my Mom chose life for me and my ten brothers and sisters instead of making excuses like this. She went through a lot of pain and financial cost and worry. But there is no baby out there that isn't all these things. I think more women (Or adolescent girls who get into sex early in life) would choose to let their child live if they saw what a baby truly looks like and what a baby truly is. They wouldn't look at early babies like they were nothing more than an inert bunch of matter.\n \n So my question is this. Why don'y they call those bunch of cells a baby? Do they:\n \n 1. Do it because they believe it really is a baby\n \n or\n \n 2. Do it because it eases their conscience when they kill it?",

   "aww yes,\n \n The Person v. Human arguement. This is more of a word game to justify rather than describing reality. I often ask the question...if you are pro-choice...then why do you feel it is your job or the mothers job to determine if someone else is deserving of human rights that a person has? This might be \"begging the question\" but don't we have to? If not, then I could say John Smith is not a person and thus it is ok to kill him. Any reasonable person would find this crazy and say \"well of course he is a person\". What makes you so sure? What gives you the authority to make such a call? Who are you to tell someone else they are not a person deserving of rights?\n \n I suppose you can play words games all day though...but whether you call the unborn a fetus, human, person, dog, cat, goat doesn't really matter because he/she doesn't change based on a word.\n \n The unborn deserves life because you deserve life as well.

I haven't heard any women who have had an abortion call it \"a bunch of cells\". I haven't heard any women post abortion not consider it a \"human being\". I have heard the term \"fetus\" more than \"baby\". This could be because 1. Eases their conscious or 2. It's a 'more correct' scientifically phrase. (up for debate with some)\n \n With the women I've talked to, if they've had an \"early on\" abortion they feel less like it was a baby and more like it was an unknown that lacked personification b/c it lacked personality, they couldn't feel it, they didn't \"show\", they didn't allow themselves to name it, use their imagination over what kind of person it would grow up to be, etc. Denial? Perhaps.\n \n I think it's a choice they make in their best interests, and they have to come to terms with their conscience. If they cannot come to terms with their conscience regarding having an abortion, then they have the child.",

They try to justify this idea because the young fetus is the only arguement view they can fall back on in such a debate. At least, that is what I've seen.\n \n A fetus is not a fully developed person. So what? What difference does that make? emoticon_confused They are still a person, and it should be just as much a crime for killing it as any person outside its mothers womb.\n \n And when I talk about abortions, of course, I am talking of humans.

So far, the scientific evidence I have read on the topic suggest that this can start happening in the early part of the third trimester (ex. ~30th week). Ex: from part 4 of http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtml\n Thinking occurs, of course, in the brain--principally in the top layers of the convoluted \"gray matter\" called the cerebral cortex. The roughly 100 billion neurons in the brain constitute the material basis of thought. The neurons are connected to each other, and their linkups play a major role in what we experience as thinking. But large-scale linking up of neurons doesn't begin until the 24th to 27th week of pregnancy--the sixth month. \n \n By placing harmless electrodes on a subject's head, scientists can measure the electrical activity produced by the network of neurons inside the skull. Different kinds of mental activity show different kinds of brain waves. But brain waves with regular patterns typical of adult human brains do not appear in the fetus until about the 30th week of pregnancy--near the beginning of the third trimester. Fetuses younger than this--however alive and active they may be--lack the necessary brain architecture. They cannot yet think. \n As for the recovery of the brain-dead person, my understanding is that, when a person is declared brain-dead, that means that their cognitive capabilities cannot recover.

The philosophical question comes up whether this resurected person is a new person or a continuation of the already existing person. If it is a new person (who is essentially a cloned brain inhabiting the body of the old one), then, up to the point of brain restoration, he would never have mentally existed yet so yes, if it were necessary, I would condone killing that still uninhabited body since you can't kill someone who doesn't exist yet. However, for the brain restored person to be considered the same person, there would have to be some continuation of mental existence, which brings us to the same point as my previous posting - Science would have to prove that one can mentally exist without brain waves.\n \n I thought I made this clear.

I do not understand why. Do you require thoughts or emotions to be either communicateable or even conscious to exist? I don't. As long as measurements of their brain waves indicate that there are some mental processes still existing that reflect some level of mind, then I would not support \"pulling the plug\" on them.

   "You and I seem to have differences of opinion about what we consider \"thoughts and emotions\". You seem to require some visible sign - either through verbal communication or physical expressions. You assume that my interpretation of \"thoughts and emotions\" is the same as yours and therefore seem to assume that I would exclude such people as Alzheimer's patients from \"personhood\". My main point is that my definition of rudimentary thoughts and emotions is much different than yours. I neither require them to be communicated (verbally or physically) nor for the person to even be conscious. Even the person having a sense of self (the concept of I) is enough for a mind. Even the person being able to choose to lift up their arm or look in a particular direction involves a mind and simple thoughts. The scientific references I have come upon so far show that the higher brain waves accompany thoughts and suggest that, where there are no higher brain waves, there is no mind. Have you run across any literature that suggests that these Alzheimer's patients have no higher brain waves? If so, please quote and reference them.\n If this is your standard then an unborn qualifies pretty earlier on. At worst you would have to say this unborn qualifies...this is before 3rd trimester. However, even in the first trimester an unborn qould qualify under your standard. Furthermore, you state that it doesn't need to be communicated verbally or physically....I never said it did and if this were the case why does the unborn require this? An Alzheimers patient in the severe stage is no more capable than the unborn in the link I just provided you.

I don't know where you got that quote from by the way...please link.\n \n \n So I am not sure where your standard lies. Is it movement or some thought at all? I thouht observation was not the way to determine this. Is it a sense of \"I\" because any doctor will tell you that an Alzheimers patient has no thought of \"I\".

I wonder if you might be working from the conclusion that the unborn is not a person and finding ways to justify this.\n\n My goal is to try to analyze the situation as objectively as I can and then draw conclusions. If Science could show the highly improbable situation that a one month old embryo has a mind, then I would change my stance on abortion to not allow almost all abortions, and would then push hard for as good contraceptives as the medical profession could possibly make.\n \n As things stand, that is not the case (luckily for women who need to make such a choice). The scientific sources I've seen so far point to the potential for thought starting around the beginning of the third trimester. The two examples which you gave - a photo of an earlier fetus grasping a doctor's finger and the response stimuli to a mother's voice can, at first glance, appear that there is a mind that drove that finger or a mind that reacted to the mother's voice. However, one has to analyze farther. For example, with the fetus photo, it is easy to jump to assumptions that the fetus might have felt fear and held onto a finger for emotional support because that is what we might assume from similar image of a young child. It is an emotionally stirring photo because of that assumption. However, we have to ask ourselves whether that assumption is right and that is where Science comes in. Scientists have investigated wide ranges of biological / neurological behavior and are able to distinguish between behavior that involves a thinking mind and behavior governed by the body itself - as in reflex actions. I do not have the background in biology to judge for myself so I trust the results of scientific inquiry. \n \n ok, so we look at actual thought and emotion from the cerebral cortex.

There comes a point in the development of a fetus' cerebral cortex that thought first becomes possible and that seems to be reflected by the onset of higher brain waves. If there would come a time that there are NO higher brain waves in an Alzheimers patient, then I would also agree that there is no mind left. You have not shown that that is the case and I haven't heard that to be the case. \n \n My view is not arbitrary at all..in fact, it is even what a common dictionary says. Human and person are just interchangable words...not that this even matters. http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=person\n \n I think it is not my call to try and make some standard for seperating humans and persons for the sole purpose of abortion law.

Science actually told us that blacks were not people like whites but that proved to be wrong on so many levels...same thing with Jews. It goes farther back then this though. Once you decide to rank humans and classify them, you always end up discriminating and just plan being wrong.\n\n My definition of person is not arbitrary. Whenever we use the term \"person\" in any sense of having sympathy, then we always assume that there is \"somebody home\" in that human body. Otherwise, who are we having sympathy with? I simply have never gotten a good definition from you about what constitutes a person. More specifically, do you or don't you think that a newly fertilized egg is a person and, if so, why?",

   "My goal is to try to analyze the situation as objectively as I can and then draw conclusions. If Science could show the highly improbable situation that a one month old embryo has a mind, then I would change my stance on abortion to not allow almost all abortions, and would then push hard for as good contraceptives as the medical profession could possibly make.\n \n As things stand, that is not the case (luckily for women who need to make such a choice). The scientific sources I've seen so far point to the potential for thought starting around the beginning of the third trimester. The two examples which you gave - a photo of an earlier fetus grasping a doctor's finger and the response stimuli to a mother's voice can, at first glance, appear that there is a mind that drove that finger or a mind that reacted to the mother's voice. However, one has to analyze farther. For example, with the fetus photo, it is easy to jump to assumptions that the fetus might have felt fear and held onto a finger for emotional support because that is what we might assume from similar image of a young child. It is an emotionally stirring photo because of that assumption. However, we have to ask ourselves whether that assumption is right and that is where Science comes in. Scientists have investigated wide ranges of biological / neurological behavior and are able to distinguish between behavior that involves a thinking mind and behavior governed by the body itself - as in reflex actions. I do not have the background in biology to judge for myself so I trust the results of scientific inquiry. \n \n The few links I have seen so far suggest that many areas of the brain (including the cerebral cortex) are in the process of being destroyed in an Alzheimer's patient, just like the fetus and born baby have cerebral cortexes that are in the oposite process of being developed. There comes a point in the development of a fetus' cerebral cortex that thought first becomes possible and that seems to be reflected by the onset of higher brain waves. If there would come a time that there are NO higher brain waves in an Alzheimers patient, then I would also agree that there is no mind left. You have not shown that that is the case and I haven't heard that to be the case. \n \n My definition of person is not arbitrary. Whenever we use the term \"person\" in any sense of having sympathy, then we always assume that there is \"somebody home\" in that human body. Otherwise, who are we having sympathy with? I simply have never gotten a good definition from you about what constitutes a person.

If \"everything you have read\" has shown you this...then why don't you post links to all of this. The position that the \"mind\" is where you draw the line is more arbitrary than just not deciding a line. The concept of \"higher brain waves\" means nothing because we never thought of drawing the line here until we realized we wanted the conclusion of abortion. A human is a person is a human and to try and find a difference is just playing word games to achieve a desired result.",

This is neither arbitrary as it doesn't define a point really and it doesn't discriminate based on development. So why is the sperm and egg not considered in this? Well, neither of them involve any of the views on development of life. This also support something you said earlier which is that life is a \"continum\" (was that you?).

We each consider the other's limit as arbitrary since we don't agree with it. It is absurd to equate either of our limits with setting a limit at the development of fingernails. Since I consider your view arbitrary, I could say the same about you, but logic prevents me.

I am already erring on the side of safety - at least where that one critical criteria is concerned- the possible presence of a mind.

Therefore, I have no problems with abortion before the third trimester because there is no mind involved yet and, therefore, no person, and because the woman's right to her own body should supercede that of a living human fetal body that is not yet mentally existing.\n \n However, once that mental existence comes into play then I believe that the woman should have to carry that dependent person since, after all, she had six months to decide and she knew what was coming. I acknowledge extenuating circumstances such as a risk of the mother's death or serious risk to her health as warranting exceptions. As for when that point of personhood would be determined, it is apparently easier to scientifically determine when it is too early for a mind to exist than it is to determine when a mind does start to exist. However, I, personally, would be willing to err in law on the side of caution and set that point at the beginning of the third trimester.",

   "This is the biggest fallacy done of these forums. Being male has nothing to do with it because I know many females with the same views as me and the original poster. So right there your arguement is irrelevant. Even more so though, we all understand the situation because we were all once a fetus. I guess, by your own admission, that if you are white you can't say slavery is wrong with any authority. Furthermore, if you were supposed to be aborted and were not yet you are a male you have no say in the issue. \n \n LOGICAL FALLACY\n\n \n \n I agree with Steeeeve. To say that just because someone is male is sexist. I disagree that because some women make this argument, that it is invalid. This is attacking the person because of there sex, and not dealing with the argument. If males cannot have a say on this subject, then the Roe v Wade decision should be overturned.
