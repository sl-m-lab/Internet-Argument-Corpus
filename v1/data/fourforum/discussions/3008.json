   "Congress Praises Israel, Demands PA End Terrorism And Incitement - But Does Not Address Israeli Terrorism\n \n The U.S. Congress overwhelmingly approved a resolution last week demanding that the Palestinian Arabs halt their terrorism and incitement against Israel.\n \n The resolution, sponsored originally by Deputy Majority Whip Eric Cantor (R-Va.), stated that the House of Representatives \"commends the people of Israel for reaffirming their dedication to democratic ideals as expressed in the election on January 28, 2003\" and \"expresses both its respect for the freely expressed will of the people of Israel, and its intention to engage in constructive relations with the new Government of Israel, and urges the international community to do so as well.\"\n \n The resolution, H.R. 61, was adopted by a vote of 411 to 2.
