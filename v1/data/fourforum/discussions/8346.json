   "Mix 2 Marvel Superheros and try to make the best combination possible. Don't pick people like the Beyonder or Phoenix. If a hero was capable of destroying the universe already then they are deemed too powerful. So far the best ones my friends have made are:\n \n The Flash and Juggernaut- The Juggernaut cannot be stopped once he gains momentum and the Flash can gain momentum without moving.\n \n Superman and Magneto- Superman is pushing the too powerful line so try not to use him.\n \n Nightcrawler and Rogue- I made this one and the next one. I could teleport to you and then grab you and you would be helpless.\n \n Exodus and Destiny- I could know what you are about to do and stop you ahead of time.\n \n See what you can come up with and try and give a short explanation why.",
