   "I'm like, \"You got to be kidding me. This is a national disaster. Get every doggone Greyhound busline in the country and get their asses moving to New Orleans.\"\n RAY NAGIN, MAYOR OF NEW ORLEANS\nFact: This while W was at a fundraiser in San Diego.\n \n \nYou know what really upsets me, Garland? We told everybody the importance of the 17th Street Canal issue. We said, \"Please, please take care of this. We don't care what you do. Figure it out.\" RAY NAGIN, MAYOR OF NEW ORLEANS\nFact: George W. Bush and the Senate and House of Representatives, both controlled by his party, CUT the funding for the repair and maintenance of the levy system in New Orleans each of the past three years dispite grave warnings from experts, the city of New Orleans and the State of Louisiana\n \nThey said it was some pulleys that they had to manufacture. But, you know, in a state of emergency, man, you are creative, you figure out ways to get stuff done.\n Then they told me that they went overnight and they built 17 concrete structures and they had the pulleys on them and they were going to drop them.\n I flew over that thing yesterday and it's in the same shape that it was after the storm hit. There is nothing happening. And they're feeding the public a line of bull and they're spinning, and people are dying down here. RAY NAGIN, MAYOR OF NEW ORLEANS\nFact: George W. Bush and his administration have made many incorrect assumptions and statements since they have been in office.\n \n Read the entire transcript of the interview with Ray Naglin, Mayor Of New Orleans at:\n http://www.wonkette.com/politics/ray-nagin/index.php#nagins-nightmare-full-transcript-123683",

The FEMA director had to be told by reporters in interviews on day 4 that people were dying there. He seemed actually surprised that no one told him. It took video from the scene.\n \n What a fiasco.",

That not even preliminary, rough estimates for any of Katrina's destruction are coming forth provides some insight as to the extent of damages.

The people in charge didn't cause their own equipment to be unable to deal with 20 feet of water.\n \n It makes no sense to me to spend energy and air time calling people on the carpet and asking why people don't resign while there are still victims waiting to be rescued. This is a catastrophe unmatched in the history of the US. One should expect chaos and delays in getting to all of the people. It's not surprising that the loudest critics of the people in power are the same ones that opposed them in the election.\n \n I'm not defending a single person in charge at this time. I'm simply pointing out that the critics are being political when they should be helping. If an admistrator has to stop and defend himself at every corner, how can he possibly do the best at the job that needs to be done?\n \n Speculation says that had the Democrats been in power when this happened, old Jesse and the rest of the jawboners would be praising their efforts no matter how inept they appeared to be.\n \n In a catastrophe of this magnitude one should not expect any less than chaos.

   "Yo Jimbo,\n \n \nIt makes no sense to me to spend energy and air time calling people on the carpet and asking why people don't resign while there are still victims waiting to be rescued.\nI'm talking about a simple move: Get the screw-ups out and the can-do's in. Don't give the screw-up the courtesy of covering their asses while people - kids, old folks - are hurting. If you do run a trucking company, then you know that you fire a driver who got drunk and crashed your truck. Right there. On the spot. You then get somebody else who can do the job.\n \n \nSpeculation says that had the Democrats been in power when this happened, old Jesse and the rest of the jawboners would be praising their efforts no matter how inept they appeared to be.\nThat hasn't been the case and you know it. Jesse and Reverend Al have been all over Democrats when they've screw-up. Those guys aren't perfect, but there a lot better than anything else we've got to represent the underprivileged.\n \n \nIn a catastrophe of this magnitude one should not expect any less than chaos. The criticizers are doing NOTHING constructive!\nYeah, I guess you're right. With these guys in office, incompetence has become acceptable - almost inevitable. But if those were your people down there, then you know as well as I do what would be happening if this happened in Beverly Hill, CA, or Arlington, VA, or Palm Beach, FL, or Greenwich, CT. Do you really think there would still be people there, floating around on the roofs of their Benzes and Jags, after a week?\n \n \nScrew Jesse Jackson and all who think like he does!\nDon't take your anger out on the wrong people.",
