   "Last night in the vice-presidential debate, Joe Biden clearly responded to a question \"do you support gay marriage\" (very straightforward question) with a \"no.\" \n &#8220;No. Barack Obama nor I support redefining from a civil side what constitutes marriage. We do not support that,&#8221;\n Of course, gay-advocate news spun that, and doesn't really seem interested in taking Biden and Obama to task for his comments ....\n \n \"The nuanced discussion may well have been lost on average viewers, who easily could have walked away thinking that the two candidates hold essentially the same view: They do not support gay marriage. But Sen. Biden argued that same-sex couples should be treated equally under the law and afforded all the same rights and responsibilities as straight married couples.\n \n Gov. Palin did not clarify whether she agreed with Biden on that point. Based on past statements, one might reasonably deduce that she does not. Although she did veto a bill in Alaska that would have denied health benefits to partners of state employees, she did so at the urging of her attorney general, who argued that signing the bill would have been a violation of the state constitution as interpreted by Alaska&#8217;s highest court. At the time, Palin said she personally disagreed with providing partner benefits but was legally compelled as governor to kill the bill. \" (http://www.advocate.com/exclusive_detail_ektid62946.asp )\n \n The article tries to focus on Palin, saying she didn't clarify, but Palin's comments were considerably more straightforward and less vague than Biden's on this. Biden's, on the other hand, seemed downright contradictory--on one hand he very clearly said he doesn't support gay marriage, then on the other hand he's talking about constitutional rights. The question about gay marriage, that Biden answered emphatically with a 'no' could not have been misunderstood by him--it was a completely straightforward question. If anyone, it's Biden who should have 'clarified'.\n \n I've never quite understood why so many gay rights advocates give such leeway toward Democrat candidates. Here we have one flat out saying they don't support gay marriage. Yet as usual, the only ones being criticized for it are the Republicans, and the DNC candidates are getting a pass on it. It seems to me that the real news here is that Biden, the Democrat nominee with gay special-interest constituents, so emphatically came out against gay marriage at that debate. But of course, we aren't hearing any of that from the gay press, who (as usual) are giving their candidates a free pass.

Bad the sad reality is that we can't, not at this stage anyway. \n \n In this particular case, if Biden says he doesn't support gay marriage I'm just as likely to think it's because he knows that open support could cost him the White House as any other reason.

   "So there's no need to be outraged or question a candidate further just on the basis that he represents the lesser-of-two-evils to you?\n\n \"outrage\" implies pointlessly excessive emotion, and therein lies the path to Archie and Matthew.\n \"Question a candidate further\"?\n Like I said, we've already had all the Democratic candidates come by to answer \"questions\" on the issue.\n \n If there is a chance to change their minds, I will take it.\n But I think, at the moment, the energy is better spent getting the candidate into the White House that you HAVE A CHANCE at changing their mind, instead of Palin or McCain who are obviously in the anti-gay hip pocket...\n \n \n \nYou're using the fact Palin is there to avoid needing to take Biden to task for HIS statements. If, hypothetically speaking, Palin wasn't there at all and Biden had made the statement alone in a stump speech, you would just leave it at that and not take him to task for his position???\n\n Seriously.\n What do you want?\n I have said I disagree.\n Do you want me to burn him in effigy? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Just out of curiousity, do you remember what my ACTUAL position is on the \"gay marriage / civil union\" thing?\n If you did, I don't think you would be bugging me so much about this... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nFrankly, if he's the candidate you feel best supports gay rights, I would think this statement on his part would be MORE alarming, and all the MORE cause for concern.\n\n Why?\n Why should I be \"alarmed\" or \"concerned\"?\n He obviously stated support for equality. He obviously stated constitutional support for gays.\n He didn't actually give me any NEW information. It's not like the previous stance was \"Obama is for gay marriage\", and now Biden says \"against\".\n \n I thoroughly fail to see why I should be \"more\" alarmed over the guy I have MORE AGREEMENT with... emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \nSo Biden was against gay marriage there too?\n\n Biden wasn't there.\n Obama was.\n And yes. Obama was against gay marriage there.\n \n Is perhaps part of the problem with you not understanding the situation is that you don't know that this is \"old news\" to us?\n \n \n \nemoticon_xdonno If he's against your right to marriage, knowing why might very well give insight into whether he would change on it at some point or actually be anti-gay in OTHER ways too!\n\n :xbanghead\n Biden gave a fairly thorough answer on \"equality\" and constitutional protection.\n He stated open support for civil unions.\n I don't think there is an \"other way\" he could be anti-gay that he hasn't already established he is PRO-gay.\n \n \n \nFrankly, I find this idea of not probing further to at least try to get some insight into motivations on issues to be pretty odd, let alone not criticizing someone for an anti-gay view just because the other candidate is more anti-gay.\n\n Hypothetically, let's suppose that we sprinkle magical pixie dust on Obama / Biden, and they become FIRMLY FOR gay marriage. 100%. No equivocation.\n Then what?\n Does that mean that we'll get gay marriage? No.\n Does that mean that we'll have a snowball's chance in hades of getting gay marriage through Congress? No.\n \n These things come in stages.\n Quite frankly, I would be more concerned if they stated they were against civil unions. THAT would bring a bigger response.\n Right now, we're at a stage where there is a bigger concern over squashing REPUBLICAN attempts at bringing up a gay marriage amendment, which Democrats have faithfully done, than there is for instituting gay marriage.\n I see a bigger concern, and an earlier goal, for instituting ENDA. I see an earlier goal for eliminating the military prohibition against gays.\n \n Gay marriage? I think that's going to be the LAST equality goal that we'll pass.\n And we'll get there.\n But we've got other things we're going to accomplish first...",

   "IFILL: The next round of -- pardon me, the next round of questions starts with you, Senator Biden. Do you support, as they do in Alaska, granting same-sex benefits to couples? BIDEN: Absolutely. Do I support granting same-sex benefits? Absolutely positively. Look, in an Obama-Biden administration, there will be absolutely no distinction from a constitutional standpoint or a legal standpoint between a same-sex and a heterosexual couple.\n \n The fact of the matter is that under the Constitution we should be granted -- same-sex couples should be able to have visitation rights in the hospitals, joint ownership of property, life insurance policies, et cetera. That's only fair.\n \n It's what the Constitution calls for. And so we do support it. We do support making sure that committed couples in a same-sex marriage are guaranteed the same constitutional benefits as it relates to their property rights, their rights of visitation, their rights to insurance, their rights of ownership as heterosexual couples do.\n\n \n Note the affirming manner in which Biden uses the term \"same-sex marriage\". He obviously has respect for those in one, even if he says it's not the position of Obama or himself to support that officially, or to have it officially recognized. There may be an indication of progress in the thinking of American politicians. \n \n \nIFILL: Governor, would you support expanding that beyond Alaska to the rest of the nation?\n \n PALIN: Well, not if it goes closer and closer towards redefining the traditional definition of marriage between one man and one woman. And unfortunately that's sometimes where those steps lead.\n \n But I also want to clarify, if there's any kind of suggestion at all from my answer that I would be anything but tolerant of adults in America choosing their partners, choosing relationships that they deem best for themselves, you know, I am tolerant and I have a very diverse family and group of friends and even within that group you would see some who may not agree with me on this issue, some very dear friends who don't agree with me on this issue.\n \n But in that tolerance also, no one would ever propose, not in a McCain-Palin administration, to do anything to prohibit, say, visitations in a hospital or contracts being signed, negotiated between parties.\n \n But I will tell Americans straight up that I don't support defining marriage as anything but between one man and one woman, and I think through nuances we can go round and round about what that actually means.\n\n \n More nuances indeed. What does this actually mean? She's not saying she supports a Constitutional Amendment. Would she leave it up to the courts to decide issues of gay equality, as happened in Alaska? Then, she could once again, go to the anti-gay parts of her base, and say, she and/or Mccain had to do what the courts said.\n \n \nBIDEN: No. Barack Obama nor I support redefining from a civil side what constitutes marriage. We do not support that. That is basically the decision to be able to be able to be left to faiths and people who practice their faiths the determination what you call it.\n\n \n Very careful wording there. He said that is not the position, but once again affirming same-sex marriage, in a different way.",

In an election year, parties cover over their differences and unite -- or they lose. You don't expect your party allies to support you on every issue, that's just unrealistic. And Biden is streets better than Palin on gay rights issues. Better, in fact, than virtually any GOP incumbent.\n \n I can't figure out why some folk here STILL pretend to be astonished that gays tend to support Democrats more than Republicans, even though Democrats won't, at present, offer full support. This isn't rocket science: the GOP has for far too long been dominated by religious extremists, some of whom would happily see gay people jailed, subjected to therapy, or even executed. The GOP is not in the interests of gay Americans who value their freedom -- even if Democrats are not yet fully on board the equal rights agenda, they at least aren't trying to gut it and deprive gay citizens of their rights by acts of Congress (e.g. the federal marriage amendment)... a strategy which most Republicans have supported.",

But there are times and places, and this election is about kicking the GOP hard where it hurts them the most. It's about Bush and the utter incompetence and corruption of his administration, not gay marriage.\n \n I'll avoid the more odious and garish comparisons of gay Americans who have supported the Bush administration particularly and the GOP in general. I think they have their priorities all wrong, however, and are not serving their own interests, their county's, or those of their fellow gay Americans. If they can't bring themselves to vote for the Democrats on principle, they should stay home in November.\n \n I'd like to see more gay GOP supporters like Andrew Sullivan, who have the courage to realise that their party has essentially betrayed them, and that between Bush and the religious extremists in Congress, the current GOP needs to be strongly rejected, if it to learn any lessons and reform.\n \n Gay rights aren't really an inherently liberal issue any more than they are a conservative issue (though they are a progressive issue, and there used to be fiscal conservatives who were also social progressives -=- maybe there still are). They are a human issue, and deserve support from all parties. The Democrats are closer to learning this lesson than the GOP. \n \n Folk like our jyosh would prefer us to indulge in stabbing the Democrats in the back because they aren't perfect, so the Bush fiasco gets to continue for another 4 years the US can ill afford under that Bush-hugger McCain. In politics, if you let the good wait on the perfect, nothing would ever happen at all. It is far from hypocritical to avoid criticising Biden just because he's a more tepid supporter than one could wish for. He's still miles better than anything the GOP has to offer.",

Just don't pretend that you never held your original position, that's dishonest.\n\n \n \nActually, you questioned earlier about a lack of \"outrage\"...\n jyoshu: So there's no need to be outraged or question a candidate further just on the basis that he represents the lesser-of-two-evils to you?\n\n \n Nice attempt at diversion, but you don't seem willing to go for \"outrage\" OR \"further questioning.\" Regardless, there's nothing wrong with making a fuss, either. It happens all the time in politics.

Let there be free exchange of discussion about issues. Let's not let our candidates (on EITHER side) get off the hook so easily on things. That's really what this is about.",

The point is that those were token measures to begin with. Come on, get real.

And yes, I fully realize the R's aren't on your side. But at SOME point surely you step back and not just use a \"but-they're-worse\" argument and look at your own party's lack of initiative for your rights.

One of the biggest reasons it took that long is because the 14th wasn't interpreted nearly as broadly early on as it is today. That's due to changes in constitutional interpretation--a move away from originalism in more recent times. It took the courts interpreting the amendment many years later in Loving to make that happen. IOW, for nearly 100 years, the 14th wasn't understood to mean what the courts say it means today. (And even then, I'd have much preferred such sweeping change to have been done via legislature rather than by reinterpreting amendments, but that's another debate.) \n \n Re. the slavery example, that too isn't a good example. You're using an example of a minority that had far, far, more distance to cover in terms of rights than you have to start with. Gays were never enslaved in this country, after all. You've been able to vote all along. You've even been able to marry all along the same way everyone else does; it's just that in recent times we've come to understand more about sexuality. Other than being able to marry a different way than everyone else, you've basically had MOST the same legal rights that everyone else has. (That's not an argument against GRANTING gay rights by the way, before you freak out over that. I'm just addressing your point in THIS case.) So if you're saying it's going faster than other minorities, it's because you really didn't have nearly as far to come as they did to begin with. \n \n (Though one could point out to you another angle--that gays didn't really have these rights you're wanting even at the time of slavery, EITHER, so in that sense it's taken you LONGER than it has these other minorities.)\n \n \n \nIt's pretty astounding how you keep saying this lame junk.\n \"Sneaking\"?\n I swear.

It was part of the discussion.\n But it's like saying I believe in racial equality, but not for blacks in my work-place. The WORDS that were put in effect are what were put into effect. Not the desires of how to restrict those words.\n \n These things CHANGED OVER TIME. Attitudes changed.\n And it's that change that takes time.\n \n \n \nThat's due to changes in constitutional interpretation--a move away from originalism in more recent times.\n\n I'm sorry, but no.\n We still had \"originalism\" in 1967.\n The Supreme Court WAS UNANIMOUS in their decision, including a court that was probably closer to \"originalism\" than it is today.\n Even under \"originalism\", the 14th amendment forbade miscegenation laws.\n \n \n \nRe. the slavery example, that too isn't a good example. You're using an example of a minority that had far, far, more distance to cover in terms of rights than you have to start with. Gays were never enslaved in this country, after all.\n\n I get tired of this pretense that somehow, because blacks had a longer road to go (which nobody disputes), that somehow invalidates analogies.\n You want to talk about \"distance\"?\n Were blacks ever \"treated\" to cure their blackness by electro-shock treatment or lobotomies?\n We've had our own path to go, and while we have always had the right to vote, the REASONS that we had to travel those uphill battles are very similar.\n And more to the point of the analogy, the REASONS those battles were LONG are the same.\n \n Cause that is my underlying point, which your complaint does not address.\n I am pointing out the REASON WHY our uphill battle is long.\n Cause change like this doesn't happen quick or easy. Not when you've got huge obstacles of prejudice involved.\n \n \n \nYou've been able to vote all along.\n\n And when was the black suffrage amendment put into the federal constitution?\n THAT one was actually pretty quick in the big scheme of things.\n \n \n \nYou've even been able to marry all along the same way everyone else does; it's just that in recent times we've come to understand more about sexuality. Other than being able to marry a different way than everyone else, you've basically had MOST the same legal rights that everyone else has.\n\n If you want to take the minimalist approach, I can also list off all the rights that blacks had after the 13, 14, 15 amendments. It's a much larger list than the specific legislation that was passed to address their discrimination.\n \n \n \nSo if you're saying it's going faster than other minorities, it's because you really didn't have nearly as far to come as they did to begin with.\n\n The real point of that is that we DO HAVE DISTANCE to go.\n \n \n \nFoundit, you're making WAY too much of my use of that term.\n\n If you want to retract it, I'll understand...\n \n \n \nYou said yourself that it was all about \"timing\", meaning that you don't think gay rights should be made an issue NOW (due to the danger of political fallout no doubt).\n\n It's funny to see you continue to do that.\n I gave three explicit reasons.\n The ONLY one you acknowledge is \"political fallout\".\n \n \n \nYou're avoiding an issue then, to get a candidate in office to further your cause at a later time.

It's very much alive.\n Just not available for Republican fodder pre-election time.\n Just cause we aren't going to paint the bathrooms of a building before the foundation concrete is poured doesn't mean it is being \"avoided\".\n \n 2) \"further our cause at a later time\"...\n Assuming \"later time\" means after the election, that's fairly accurate.\n Can't really get any legislative changes effected from a political candidate before he gets elected...",

Marriage is a right, and as such should not be subject to arbitrary and unjustifiable (without a legitimate state interest) discriminatory measures.\n Gay marriage, like interracial marriage before it, will be fought in the courts.\n \n Civil Unions? Which Biden and Obama support? Those could be fought in the legislature / president signing legislation into law.\n But that support we already have.\n \n Biden saying \"Yes to constitutional gay protections\" has almost as much importance (assuming Biden's opinion had importance, as opposed to Obama's) than saying \"yes to gay marriage\".\n Again, reference history. When the 14th amendment was passed, people were saying \"yes\" to the mandates of the 14th amendment, but \"no\" to interracial marriage. But effectively, they WERE saying \"yes\" due to WHAT THEY SET IN MOTION.\n \n Any judge that recognizes constitutional gay protections will typically realize that such equality demands gay marriage.",

   "Last night in the vice-presidential debate, Joe Biden clearly responded to a question \"do you support gay marriage\" (very straightforward question) with a \"no.\" \n \"No. Barack Obama nor I support redefining from a civil side what constitutes marriage. We do not support that,\"\n Of course, gay-advocate news spun that, and doesn't really seem interested in taking Biden and Obama to task for his comments ....\n \n \"The nuanced discussion may well have been lost on average viewers, who easily could have walked away thinking that the two candidates hold essentially the same view: They do not support gay marriage. But Sen. Biden argued that same-sex couples should be treated equally under the law and afforded all the same rights and responsibilities as straight married couples.\n \n Gov. Palin did not clarify whether she agreed with Biden on that point. Based on past statements, one might reasonably deduce that she does not. Although she did veto a bill in Alaska that would have denied health benefits to partners of state employees, she did so at the urging of her attorney general, who argued that signing the bill would have been a violation of the state constitution as interpreted by Alaska's highest court. At the time, Palin said she personally disagreed with providing partner benefits but was legally compelled as governor to kill the bill. \" (Biden, Palin Debate Same-Sex Marriage &#160;|&#160;Election 2008 | Advocate.com )\n \n The article tries to focus on Palin, saying she didn't clarify, but Palin's comments were considerably more straightforward and less vague than Biden's on this. Biden's, on the other hand, seemed downright contradictory--on one hand he very clearly said he doesn't support gay marriage, then on the other hand he's talking about constitutional rights. The question about gay marriage, that Biden answered emphatically with a 'no' could not have been misunderstood by him--it was a completely straightforward question. If anyone, it's Biden who should have 'clarified'.\n \n I've never quite understood why so many gay rights advocates give such leeway toward Democrat candidates. Here we have one flat out saying they don't support gay marriage. Yet as usual, the only ones being criticized for it are the Republicans, and the DNC candidates are getting a pass on it. It seems to me that the real news here is that Biden, the Democrat nominee with gay special-interest constituents, so emphatically came out against gay marriage at that debate. But of course, we aren't hearing any of that from the gay press, who (as usual) are giving their candidates a free pass. Why aren't they demanding Biden explain his emphatic answering of \"no\" to that question? Why aren't they demanding that HE clarify?\n\n Personally I think both sides positions are the same and we won't see anything major from them concerning gay marriage.\n \n Personally, I think McCain should just say - let's get government out of marriages and leve it to religious institutions, and instead estabish civil unions for everyone that give the benefits that are now given to marriages - make those open to any two consenting adults.\n \n If he did that, I'd be even more happy to vote for him than I am now.",
