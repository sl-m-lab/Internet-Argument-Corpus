Did the Jews kill Jesus? Does the Christian religion teach that? All these questions answered.... AND MORE in this thread.\n\n Mel Gibson is a passionate traditional Catholic who, in my view, made this movie as a labor of love. He had to use a lot of his money to get the movie made, which shows that the money people around him thought it was a loser. Mel might have been savvy enough to know that tens of millions of Christians would support the movie, and he might have suspect that controversy would accompany this movie making it profitable. It looked he might have done a good job making use of the controversy--it has grossed almost $400 million. \n \n I'm not sure I know what you mean by snuff film--do you mean sadistic? Mel has always liked graphic violence in his movies, and I think he wanted to drive home in a VERY forceful way the pain Jesus suffered for everyone. \n \n My understanding of the New Testament is that many in the Jewish leadership of the time saw Jesus as a blasphemer and a threat (by their beliefs he was a blasphemer, and it appears he was a real threat to their authority) and these elemetns succeeded in getting the Romans to kill him for sedition. There are phrases in the New Testament which could be construed as saying that \"the Jews\" rejected Jesus, but all Christian churches I know of nowadays do not blame Jews for Jesus' death. At the worst, some may see corrupt elements of the Jewish leadership as behind his death, but the material point is that Christians believe it was part of God's plan for this to happen, and was consequently a good thing. From what I've seen of contemporary Christian churches, Jews as a group are respected a great deal. These folks are pro-Jewish and pro-Israel, so I think all the worry over the movie and claims of anti-Semitism were unwarranted.",

And you seem to be saying THE purpose of those old plays was to whip up hatred. I don't know that such was the case at all. Of course hatred was at times a consequence of those plays, but you'll have to back up the claim that this was the reason why the plays were CREATED and performed in the first place.",

Doesn't it seem a slight bit gratuitous? \n \n Enlighten me.\n\n Much of the criticism of The Passion has been due to its violence. But I wonder where these same critics have been for the last decade of film-making. Why did we not here from them about Natural Born Killers, True Romance, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, etc? Kill Bill seems to be a thesis of taking violent scenes to the extreme (although I only watched the first part of the movie). \n \n I have also never heard a director or writer get so much criticism on presenting one aspect of a history. He did not ignore or alter the other aspects of Jesus' teaching or the resurrection. It was a film on Jesus' Passion thus most of the content dealt with the Passion. This criticism is like leveling criticism at a Civil War historian for writing a book on the Battle of Gettysburg and not discussing every other battle of the entire war.\n \n But let me give you my Christian perspective on the violence of the movie. Many say it was too much. I say it might have been an eye-opener. It was for me and may have been for others. The film was not needed for a devoted faith and understanding of Christ. But it is helpful to it in my opinion. \n \n Growing up one hears all of the gospels.Catholics have the stations of the cross. One sees paintings, sculptures, carvings. All of this is a bit distant and usually very neat and clean. But the movie gives one a perspective on what it must have truly been like. \n \n Many of that time were crucified like Jesus. But if Jesus was God, and if he did suffer for the sins of all mankind, then he most likely endured more than the crucifixion that those others suffered--the crowning of thorns, the scourging, the beating, the ridicule/spitting/cursing of the onlookers, the carrying of the cross. Gibson's portrayal may have involved some artistic license. But in terms of the extent of suffering and violence it portrayed it may have been close to the truth. Not necessarily the exact truth, but close to it. Because if God suffered then it must have been a horrible suffering. And if man was saved it must have been a beautiful suffering. The ideals of Christianity can't help but to be stained with the blood of Christ.",

Try using some reasonable logic (I am aware of the redundancy). There is nothing in what you posted that is an accurate portrayal of the film as you left out other elements.

   "epaphras_faith,\n \n I'm sorry that my argument came off with an anti-Christian bias, but nowhere in my post did I suggest this would cause a massive wave of anti-Semitism. I merely suggested that it had various portions (which are taken out of context) that portray the Jewish people in a bad light. But since I seem to be alone on this point, I will refrain from arguing further. \n \n I want to pose a question to those who can \"see\" the obviousness of the movie's message, and tell me why it was necessary to make a film which includes a torture sequence that lasts for almost 45 minutes? Is it so painfully unobvious to most people that Jesus died for their sins that they need to see a man tortured to death on screen (with some of the most graphic effects in today's cinema). Why the emphasis on the torture and not the teaching (which is conveniantly placed in 20 second \"nuggets\" in between torture)? Isn't it enough to know that He died for everyone's sins, and that He taught everyone how to live a good life? Why the excess of torture? I'm pretty sure this isn't out of context as it dominates most of the movie. So why did Gibson feel that the torture of Jesus was so important? I may not be Christian, but after seeing it, I felt very bad for him. Anyone with a shred of human decency can see that a man being tortured is wrong, without knowing that He died for their sins. Doesn't it seem a slight bit gratuitous? \n \n Enlighten me.\n\n \n As a christian I can at least imagine PART of Gibson's purpose. The images of Christ diying for our sins that have been portrayed over time (movies etc.) have caused many to lessen the sacrifice within the confines of their minds. It is easy for many christians to say, \"big deal, so he died for me, so what.\" The 45 minute torture makes it much more difficult to deny the VALUE of the sacrifice. Couple that with the concept that He was God's own Son the value increases exponentially. That, at least, is my understanding. It has helped me as I have encountered various trials in my own life. I see that Jesus himself, went willingly through far more than I have been asked, and that he will walk with me through anything. He is empathetic to me, understanding, and capable.\n \n NOw to emoreno et al. Concerning everyone's responsibility for his death. My answer may seem a bit convoluted but will have two main points. 1) The bible teaches that all men were \"seminally present\" in Adam at the fall of mankind. and 2) a God that exists outside of time sees all time as occurring simultaneously.\n \n 1) The bible teaches that regardless of the fact that Adam is the one who ate of the fruit the point is that any one of us would have made the same choice had we been there. How is this known to be true? I understand you may not accept the veracity of the bible but I use it to base my own beliefs. You don't have to accept my arguments but you cannot logically argue against me as it is a matter of belief (faith) not evidence. The fact that people do wrong is evidence of the fact that we have a wrong nature. No one is perfect. That is proof that we do not have a perfect nature. The reason? Adam's sin IS our sin. We are as responsible as if we were there. In fact, God sees us as there. This is pointed out in the book of Romans Chapter 1.\n \n 2) God exists outside of time. He also exists inside of time. He sees both ways. He sees things through the context of time and outside of that context. Therefore, all sin occurred, backwards and forwards, simultaneously. The redemption of the cross also occurrs the same way. Men are justified by faith. This is both before and after the cross (from our perspective.) Therefore, a time machine is not necessary as we are not the determiners of all there is. God is. His perspective is what counts as the clay would not say to the potter, \"your spinning the wheel too fast.\"",

Though it has not caused any actual physical outbreaks anywhere that I know of to date, I still believe it will manifest itself in more subdued and sinister ways. \n \n There is a purported scene in the movie in which a figure, believed to be Satan carrying a child, ominously threads his way through a crowd of leering Jews. One cannot miss the symbolism of this, IMO; in no way does it sound subtle to me, and even the thickest of viewers should be able to connect the two dots Gibson has provided: evil and Jews.\n \n So a devout Christian doesn't go out and bash in a few skulls immediately after the show.

If we're assuming the \"Truth\" is what the Bible says, then Gibson is not showing the Truth. His film is largely based on the visions of a Nun from the 18th century. Check it again . That's not the Bible, it's some believer's interpretation of events that are not described in very much detail in the Bible. I'm not saying that the basic elements of the Crucifixion aren't there, but there are quite a few embellishments made on behalf of the film that make it a slightly different story from the Bible. \n \n And I have a small question. Why is quoting from a book, namely the Bible in this case, considered a logical argument? Saying \"read the Bible, duh!\" doesn't really have much effect on those of us who choose to believe something different. It would be better to use some of your own thoughts when debating an issue (in my opinion).\n \n Also, did any groups complain about the other movies depicting the last hours of Christ (i.e. Jesus Christ Superstar, King of Kings, etc.) or was it just The Passion? If not, then maybe it's not just Jesus that people are complaining about, but the combination of graphic violence and Jesus.",
