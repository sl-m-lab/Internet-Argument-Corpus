   "Bob Woodward articles (same as of Watergate fame) from book of same name written based on interviews of those involved. The Washington Post is doing a 5 part series about it and i thought it very interesting read.\n \n i also believe it dispell all notion that Bush lied\n \n \n\"Plan of Attack\" by Bob Woodward is a behind-the-scenes account of how and why President Bush decided to go to war against Iraq. Beginning in late December 2001, Bush met repeatedly with Army Gen. Tommy R. Franks and his war cabinet to plan the attack even as he and administration spokesmen insisted they were pursuing a diplomatic solution. \n \n On Nov. 21, 2001, 72 days after the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, Bush directed Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld to begin planning for war with Iraq. \"Let's get started on this,\" Bush recalled saying. \"And get Tommy Franks looking at what it would take to protect America by removing Saddam Hussein if we have to.\" He also asked, Could this be done on a basis that would not be terribly noticeable? \n \n Bush received his first detailed briefing on Iraq war plans five weeks later, on Dec. 28, when Franks, the head of the U.S. Central Command, visited Bush at his ranch in Crawford, Tex. Bush told reporters afterward that they had discussed Afghanistan. \n \n The intensive war planning throughout 2002 created its own momentum, fueled in part by the CIA's conclusion that Saddam Hussein could not be removed from power except through a war and CIA Director George J. Tenet's assurance to the president that it was a \"slam dunk\" case that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. \n \n Adding to the momentum was the pressure from advocates of war inside the administration. Vice President Cheney, whom Woodward describes as a \"powerful, steamrolling force\" led that group and had developed what some of his colleagues felt was a \"fever\" about removing Hussein by force. \n \n By early January 2003, Bush had made up his mind to take military action against Iraq. But Bush was so concerned that the government of his closest ally, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, might fall because of his support for Bush that he delayed the war's start until March 19 here (March 20 in Iraq) because Blair asked him to seek a second resolution from the United Nations. Bush later gave Blair the option of withholding British troops from combat, which Blair rejected. \"I said I'm with you. I mean it,\" Blair replied. \n \n The book describes a relationship between Cheney and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell that became so strained Cheney and Powell are barely on speaking terms. Cheney engaged in a bitter and eventually winning struggle over Iraq with Powell, an opponent of war who believed Cheney was obsessively trying to establish a connection between Iraq and the al Qaeda terrorist network and treated ambiguous intelligence as fact. \n \n Information in the book comes from more than 75 key people directly involved in the events including war cabinet members, the White House staff and officials serving at various levels of the State and Defense departments and the Central Intelligence Agency. These interviews were conducted on background, meaning the information could be used but the sources would not be identified. \n \n Bush was interviewed on the record for more than 31/2 hours over two days, Dec. 10 and 11, 2003. Rumsfeld was interviewed for more than three hours in the fall of 2003. Many of the direct quotations of dialogue, dates, times and other details of this history come from documents, including personal notes, calendars, chronologies, official and unofficial records, phone transcripts and memos. Where thoughts, judgments or feelings are attributed to participants, they were obtained from the person directly, a colleague with firsthand knowledge or the written record. \n\n \n \n Today: Deciding on War \n Soon after New Year's Day in 2003, President Bush made up his mind to attack Iraq. One by one he told key members of his Cabinet -- and one prominent foreign ambassador. \n \n Monday: Making the Case \n In telling Bush that military action was the only feasible way of removing Saddam Hussein and then that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, the CIA contributed to the gathering momentum for war. \n \n Tuesday: Cabinet Divided \n Vice President Cheney and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell are longtime colleagues, but on Iraq they were bitterly divided. However, when it came time, Powell did as the president urged and put on his war uniform. \n \n Wednesday: The Special Relationship \n For President Bush, the political future of his closest ally, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, was a powerful consideration. \n \n Thursday: Countdown to War \n The frenzied day when President Bush launched an attack on Saddam Hussein's Iraq. \n \n i'll post the others as they are published",
