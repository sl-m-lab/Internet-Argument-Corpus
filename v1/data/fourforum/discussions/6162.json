   "Religion is a very powerful coping behavior, and it looks like religious beliefs and practices do seem to facilitate coping with major life circumstances, so that people who are more religious have greater well-being, lower anxiety, more purpose and meaning in life, more positive emotions. They experience less depression, less anxiety, less substance abuse. As a result, they turn out to be healthier. These mental health benefits have physical health consequences, so that religious people tend to have lower blood pressure, tend to have stronger immune systems and oftentimes will live longer, will have greater life spans than people who are less involved in religious practices.\n http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week844/interview.html\n\n This quote is from Dr. Harold Koenig of Duke University Medical Center. \n \n Religion gives people hope and thereby helps them have a more positive mental attitude when coping with life's problems. It can also benefit people by providing them with a strong social network of support which also contributes to mental health and well being.",
