   "Wyoming governor signs concealed gun bill\n \n \nCHEYENNE - Wyoming on Wednesday became the fourth state to allow citizens to carry concealed guns without a permit, with Gov. Matt Mead signing a bill into law as several other states considered similar action.\n \n The law allows state citizens legally entitled to own guns to carry them concealed starting in July. The guns still wouldn't be allowed in schools, bars and government buildings.\n \n \"We have heard from both sides on this, this bill has attracted a lot of attention,\" Mead said at a signing ceremony at the State Capitol. \"But as written, I thought it was an appropriate bill for Wyoming, and an appropriate law for Wyoming.\"\n \n Similar bills are pending in states including Colorado, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Utah. A bill has been introduced in Kentucky but hasn't advanced while another was introduced for discussion in Idaho.\n \n Alaska, Arizona and Vermont already don't require permits to carry concealed guns.\n \n The push to expand permit-free carry of concealed guns is coming from people demanding the freedom to protect themselves in tough economic times without the requirement to pay for state permits, National Rifle Association spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said.\n \n \"It's an organic movement,\" Arulanandam said. \"I think certainly we are leading the charge - I'm not hiding behind it. A lot of this is organic in the sense that it comes from people realizing that when something bad happens, it's up to them to defend themselves and their loved ones. And when something bad happens, instant responders are better than 'first responders.'\"\n \n Paul Helmke, president of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence in Washington, said Wednesday the center is concerned about the trend.\n \n \"The gun lobby is trying to push more guns into more places,\" Helmke said.\n \n Helmke noted Arizona was the most recent state to allow concealed carry without a permit. And he noted that a man has been charged in the Jan. 8 shooting that killed six people at a congressional meet-and-greet Jan. 8 outside a Tucson supermarket. Thirteen other people were wounded including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.\n \n A national push that started in the 1990s has resulted in most states allowing concealed carry of guns with a permit. Helmke said that only Illinois and Wisconsin still don't allow concealed carry.\n \n \"They don't want to lead with the fact that their next sort of agenda item is to get rid of the permits altogether,\" Helmke said of the gun lobby. \"They lead with the idea that the only people who get permits in states are people who have been thoroughly checked out and law-abiding.\"\n \n But proponents of the Wyoming bill say they're interested in respecting and restoring individual rights. Wyoming would continue to offer concealed-carry permits so citizens would have reciprocity with other states.\n \n Sponsor Sen. Kit Jennings, R-Casper, said he expects several states will follow Wyoming. \"It's a good bill. We'll go forward, and we'll protect those constitutional rights,\" he said at the bill-signing ceremony.\n \n Rep. Lorraine Quarberg, R-Thermopolis, was a co-sponsor. She said she had been working to pass such a bill for the past seven years. \"The governor by signing this bill just restored some rights to all of Wyoming citizens,\" she said.\n \n Anthony Bouchard, executive of the Wyoming Gun Owners Association, has lobbied for the Wyoming bill. He discounted the idea that such legislation is merely intended to sell guns.\n \n \"Criminals have guns, and gun laws just prevent law-abiding citizens from doing the same,\" Bouchard said.\n\n \n The news just keeps getting better and better for supporters of the constitution. For gun control loonies...not so much.",

One things for sure things are getting better for mass murderers.\n\n \n Are we to assume your position is that Jared Loughner would have not concealed his Glock model 19 before shooting Giffords if the law demanded that he first obtain a concealed carry permit before doing such?\n \n Simply because Jared Loughner hid his gun underneath his jacket/coat just minutes before shooting Giffords that doesn't mean he was legally carrying a concealed weapon. Your attempt at splitting hairs and making a case on the smallest of technicalities is horrendous and you should be ashamed of yourself.\n \n Before Arizona became the third state to allow concealed carry without a state issued permit the states of Alaska and Vermont were already doing this. Can you point to any mass murders that have occurred in these states?\n \n Furthermore there's the fact that illegally concealing a weapon is a minor charge when compared to other offenses that a person can be arrested and tried for. \n \n I already covered this point here: http://www.4forums.com/political/424811-post37.html but you failed to address the points.\n \n You keep going on about the evils of legal concealed carry Brady. You cite the Violence Policy Center and their claim that 288 people have been murdered by concealed carry holders since 2007. I pointed out that in the same time period over 1,800 people have been murdered in the city of Chicago where concealed carry and handgun ownership were both illegal and strictly punished. That's a ratio of 6 to 1. 6 people dead in Chicago for every person supposedly killed by a holder of a concealed carry permit.\n \n Look at the crime statistics for your former precious crown jewel of Chicago: http://www.cityrating.com/citycrime.asp?city=Chicago&state=IL There murder rate is 2.70 times the nation average according to the available data.",

Evidence of causation? Nah. That's just for us.\n \n \n What makes me chuckle is Brady has the brass to talk about moving goal posts.",

   "Look guys; quit your complaining about Brady-you don't know how good you have it. Ya'll may not like Brady falsely accusing you of moving goal posts, but at least you guys can get him arguing over the field conditions. I can't seem to keep him from running out of the stadium. \n \n This thread was about Wyoming. If we really want to learn something, then I suggest we nominate NATO to come back to this thread in 2, 3, 4 or 5 five years and post the link to the crime data that shows us whether Wyoming's violent crime went up, down, or stayed relatively stable after the CCW change.\n \n Or, if we want more immediate gratification, how about we look at other states that have relaxed CCW laws in the past and see what has happened to their violent crime rates? \n \n I've posted Florida's data. Additionally, my home state of Virginia became a \"shall issue\" state in 1995. I remember it well because I promptly went out and got my CCW permit, and so far I have managed not to shoot myself, my wife, or anyone else. (I have, however, allowed my permit to lapse because I became a Commonwealth's Attorney and by statutory exemption I no longer need a permit to carry concealed-I have somehow magically become one of the \"chosen\" allowed to do so without having to pay the re-application fee and wait for a re-issued permit-which I find a foolish notion. But I digress....) \n \n Here is a table of crime statistics for my state that covers '95-'09 (and many years before). Note how violent crime numbers (in total) have gradually decreased even with an increase in total population. Scroll down to the next table for the per capita rates:\n \n Virginia Crime Rates 1960 - 2009\n \n Yet another state where relaxation of CCW rules has not led to an increase in violent crime....\n \n Anybody else want to hunt up some examples?",

   "So if its cause people in high crime areas want to buy guns for protection then why do they only want protection against gun murders but not other crimes.\n\n I think Tim Lambert made a similar point about one of Kellermann's studies. He explained why the higher homicide rate in homes where guns are kept is not because people are more likely to arm themselves if they are in greater danger of being victimized:\n \n \"Gun owners were not at any greater risk of non-gun homicide, only of with-gun homicide. It does not seem plausible that people would only obtain guns to defend against threats from gun-armed enemies and not also arm themselves against an enemy that carries a knife.\n \n \"Similarly, gun owning households were only at greater risk of homicide from intimates (spouse, lover, family) i.e. those people likely to have access to the household's gun, and not at greater risk of homicide from outsiders. It does not seem plausible that people would only arm themselves against threats from inside the household and not from outside.\"\n Causation and Kellermann : Deltoid",

   "My study shows that all the stupid people in all 50 states who bought guns are more likely to get murdered. Thats what keep ignoring as you cherry pick.\n\n \n No, it does not. It shows that if you discount everything else that causes crime THEN murder rates are likely to be higher in states with a large number of guns. However, it does nothing at all to show causation. \n \n Non gun homocides are typically different from gun related homicides. Typically only about 3% of non gun homicides are 1st degree murder. If you decide you are going to kill somebody and head over to do it, you get a gun. It is the best tool for the job. If you walk in your wife making the beast with 2 backs with the mail man, you beat them both to death with the golf club leaning against the door, or stab them with the bread knife left out on the kitchen counter. You dont head down to the gun store, buy a pistol, then go back and shoot them.\n \n So, non gun homicides pretty much belong in their own class...including them in the study is irrational because second and even third degree murder are FAR different from first degree murder...which is what most gun homicides are. Non gun homicides are essentially statistical noise. Their levels dont really fluctuate, they are just a byproduct of the human condition.\n \n That said, the idea that non gun homicides dont increase does not show causation between high gun ownership and increased murder rates. It shows that you have more people CHOOSING to do violence. IF you live somewhere that a lot of people are CHOOSING to do violence, there is a much better chance that you will feel you need to carry a gun.\n \n I dont generally carry a gun. It is just pretty rare that I need to blow somebody away on the way to Caseys. When I go to florida, I carry a gun. My wife insists on it because there are a lot of people in florida CHOOSING to do violent things. I can honestly say that as far as I know, EVERYBODY I do business with in florida carries a gun because it is a dangerous place. There are several other places that when I go there, I carry a gun, whether it is legal or not. It is because they are dangerous places.",
