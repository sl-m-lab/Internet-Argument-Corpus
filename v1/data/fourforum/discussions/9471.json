   "Humans are at a very primitive stage. There is still war, violence, and negative emotions. Negative emotions were an evolutionary response to danger, but we haven't evolved far enough to the point of not needing primitive emotions. Violence is a primitive response to keep us alive. To protect us from anything different. If all violence were eliminated, there would be no need for violence in self defense.\n \n I think I can understand creationists. I have learned much about science for a 14 year old boy. I have learned a little bit about quantum mechanics, and its completely mind baffling. The thing that puzzles me most is why an electron is different once its observed. Also that an electron can be in two places at once. I have learned much more, and i haven't even scraped the tip of the iceberg of this stuff. It can be hard to understand. I believe, that people less intelligent who cannot comprehend this, resort to primitive religions and hypothesis to try to explain the universe and whats in it. Eventually, as humans become more intelligent over time, creationism and its hypothesis alike will die.\n \n We humans have still much to evolve. We have many evolutionary flaws thanks to intelligence. One thing I cite, is human's teeth. They are made of a weak material, that can be disintegrated by the very food we eat. This was flawed by intelligence, as we learned to cope. We also have very weak nasal passages, a primitive method of communication, only two limbs, and a very limited brain capacity. In other words, we're just another animal. Nothing special. We have superior intelligence but lesser strength than some animals. I fail to see the logic in creationism. With the knowledge at hand, how can it be possible to believe in something so preposterous? I do not understand it. Please, show me the logic in creationism. Do not attempt to try to point out the flaws in evolution, as that does not make creationism any more true.\n \n Shoot away.",

And that is your sole way of defending creationism as you have admitted you cannot argue creationism based on its own merits. Creationism is wrong independent of Evolution.

According to your logic, as \"humans become more intelligent over time\" we will also suffer many more \"evolutionary flaws thanks to intelligence.\" I am, to say the least, confused.\n Is intelligence a good thing (as relates to human evolution, growth, whatever you wanna call it) or a bad thing. Human teeth are \"weak\" because we live so much longer, compared to the fairly recent past when humans rarely lived to their 80's. (Discounting Methuselah, et al., of course :) ) In that instance, \"evolution\" (strengthened teeth) hasn't caught up with science (better health).\n Too, I find little about our communication ability that I would describe as \"primitive\". Of course, first we'd have to define \"primitive\", wouldn't we? If you mean we can't send electrical signals to one another via antennae then I salute you, sir, for stating the obvious. If not, please clarify.\n \n We have four limbs. Count 'em if you think I'm wrong. Though in the interest of fairness I have to point out that none of them is essential for our survival (given a certain amount of societal cooperation, that is).\n \n Lastly, since most neurologist seem to agree that we only utilize roughly 10 percent of our brain, I'd have to say it's capacity could rightly be described as enormous. I have a mere 200G of hard drive space on my computer. If you were to tell me that I actually had, tucked away inside there, another 1800 Gigabytes, I'd be stunned.
