No. So why should anyone take you seriously if you won't even take the slightest effort to make an actual challenge?",

Yet, here, after being told several times to post in the debate section, you haven't. So here's how this works: You post an official challenge in the Debate Challenges forum, and somebody does (or does not) accept the challenge. You find judges, decide terms of the debate, etc. Once the parameters have been set, the debate actually takes place in the Debate Tournaments section.\n \n Considering the above, it is ironic that you are essentially calling everybody a chicken when you're the one strutting around not knowing what you're doing.\n \n But then, if this is any indication, we shan't be expecting much in the way of research from you in your debates...",

They keep asking such profound questions as: \"If we evolved from monkeys, how come there are still monkeys?\" -- and sit back smugly triumphant as if evolution has no answer to this unanswerable conundrum. \n \n There are literally hundreds of these one-liner questions, all of which take time and effort to refute, though all are perfectly refutable.
