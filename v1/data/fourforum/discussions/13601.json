   "Posts for October, 2009\n Heterosexual Menace: Child Raping Couple Send Kiddie Porn To Child Molester Suspect\n Jim Burroway\n October 29th, 2009\n This one boggles the mind:\n \n A Kent man and his estranged wife have been arrested after authorities say they filmed themselves raping a 4-year-old girl and sending photos of the abuse to a man facing child-molestation charges in Southern California.\n \n Brian Beston, 36, and ex-wife Hollie Beston, 31, of Burien, were arrested by Seattle police last week after the FBI learned of the couple from a child-molestation suspect in Southern California, said charging documents filed Wednesday in King County Superior Court. The California man, 38-year-old Richard Hockaday, told federal investigators that he met the Bestons over Craigslist.\n \n There's more heterosexual shenanigans here and in our report, \"The Heterosexual Agenda: Exposing the Myths.\"\n \n COMMENTS (3) | LINK\n Heterosexual Menace: Cop Had Oral Sex With Cows And Got Off\n Jim Burroway\n September 26th, 2009\n \n Robert Melia (left) and Heather Lewis (right)\n \n No, none of the cows are shown in these mug shots, but the guy did get off:\n \n A New Jersey judge has dismissed animal cruelty charges against a cop accused of committing a sex act with young cows, saying a grand jury had no way of knowing whether the animals were \"tormented.\" Moorestown police officer Robert Melia, who is currently suspended, allegedly engaged in oral sex acts with five calves in Southampton in 2006. Since New Jersey currently has no law explicitly banning such an act, prosecutors in Burlington county brought animal cruelty charges against Melia, the Philadelphia Daily News reports. Judge Morely said it was questionable that Melia's acts, though \"disgusting,\" constituted animal cruelty.\n \n Burlington County assistant prosecutor Gevin Moran didn't agree. \"I think any reasonable juror could infer that a man's penis in the mouth of a calf is torment.\" But Melia's lawyer, countering with the impeccable heterosexual logic, pointed out that as long as the calves in question don't complain then everything's copacetic. The judge agreed.\n \n This is where the second mug shot comes in because they're not ready to release Melia into greener pastures just yet. He and his girlfriend, Heather Lewis, are still being held on charges of sexually assaulting three girls over a five year period. After one of the girls reported the incident to her stepfather, authorities investigated and found videos on Melia's computer which not only depicted him having sex with one of the girls, but also the romantic interludes with the buxom bovines as well. Lewis is also being accused of sexually assaulting an underage (human) male.\n \n There's more heterosexual menace here and in our report, \"The Heterosexual Agenda, Exposing the Myths.\"\n \n Tags: Heterosexual Agenda, New Jersey\n \n For related information, see Heterosexual Agenda\n \n \n Heterosexual Menace Update: Google-Eye View Of Sexual Slavery Compound\n Jim Burroway\n August 29th, 2009\n The whole world is horrified at the story unfolding from Antioch, California. Phillip Garrido, a registered sex offender, and his wife Nancy, were arrested for kidnapping and repeatedly raping eleven-year-old Jaycee Lee Dugard and holding her captive for the next eighteen years. They kept her in a maze of trees, blue tarps, tents, sheds and abandoned vehicles in the back yard of their home, along with two girls, aged 11 and 15, who Garrido fathered with Jaycee Lee.\n \n The Garrido residence is located at 1554 Walnut Ave, Antioch, California. Plug that address into Google Maps like I did, click on Satellite View, and you can see for yourself the hellhole that Jaycee Lee and her two daughters endured.\n \n \n \n Garrido had been sentenced to 50 years for kidnapping and life for rape in a separate 1975 incident in South Lake Tahoe. He was released on parole just eleven years later. An investigator recalled, \"I asked him after he confessed why he did it, it was the only way he could get sexual satisfaction. I think he had to use force to get sexual satisfaction.\"\n \n COMMENTS (6) | LINK\n Heterosexual Menace: Sexual Slavery While Speaking \"In The Tongue Of Angels\"\n Jim Burroway\n August 28th, 2009\n \n Heterosexual rapist and religious fanatic Phillip Garrido\n Eighteen years ago, an 11-year-old girl was kidnapped while she was on her way to her school bus stop. This week, she was found after her abductor aroused suspicions of a Berkeley, California police officer. Arrested were Phillip Garrido, a registered sex offender, and his wife Nancy. They kept Jaycee Lee Dugard captive in a maze of shrubs, trees, tents and sheds in the back yard of their Antioch, California home. Authorities also found two girls, aged 11 and 15, that authorities believe Garrido fathered with Jaycee Lee, whom he renamed Alissa.\n \n Jaycee Lee has never been to school or saw a doctor in the eighteen years since she was abducted. Neither have the two little girls. Acquaintances described Garrido as a \"religious fanatic.\" Reporters from The Washington Post found Garrido's blog, \"Voices Revealed,\" in which he wrote:\n \n ...[T]he Creator has given me the ability to speak in the tongue of angels in order to provide a wake-up call that will in time include the salvation of the entire world.\n \n And you know, the more we look into the Heterosexual Menace, I'm beginning to wonder if every heterosexual in the world is a predator.\n \n You can read more about the Heterosexual Agenda that straights like Garrido have in store for you in our report, The Heterosexual Agenda: Exposing the Myths.\n \n Heterosexual Menace: A Mom's Novel Approach To Conflict Resolution Between Children\n Jim Burroway\n July 3rd, 2009\n Maggie Gallagher, in reaction to the Frank Lombard case, admits that she is very mistrustful of men adopting children. \"I have a bias in favor of mothers,\" she writes. \"I have a suspicion (let me be frank - I'm not proud, but it's true) of men who want to get close to children while depriving them of mothers.\" I guess when it comes to raising children, mothers really know best. We can all probably learn some valuable lessons from moms on raising children.\n \n Like this dilemma every parent faces. What do you do when your nine-year-old child is in the middle of a long-running dispute with one of her classmates?\n \n Well if you're a licensed clinical social worker and a classroom mother at your daughter's elementary school, you post a sexually suggestive ad in the \"Casual Encounters\" section of Craigist. And when throngs of sex-seeking men answer the ad, you give them the phone number of your child's antagonist.\n \n It just makes sense, right?\n \n That's what Margery Tannenbaum thought. She placed the ad with the headline of \"Looking for a good time? W4M21&#8243; on Craiglist. The ad read, \"I need a little affection. ... I am blonde and very cute! I'll be waiting!\"\n \n Next thing you know her child's arch-enemy's mother had to field at least 50 calls from horny straight men in two days before changing her number. Tannenbaum also ordered at least eight magazine subscriptions, a book and a DVD to be sent to the child's home.\n \n Tannenbaum was arraigned on Thursday on charges of aggravated harassment and endangering the welfare of a child. Her defense lawyer - he's probably straight too, but we haven't confirmed that yet - called her a \"good, hardworking professional.\" He also says \"this is being blown out of proportion.\"\n \n This is outrageous, so outrageous I think it calls for some LaBarbera-esqe typography. Heterosexuals will stop at nothing in their thirst for debauchery! If you think this latest example is beyond the pale, then I've got news for you: this barely scratches the surface. There's more heterosexual menace here and in our report, \"The Heterosexual Agenda: Exposing the Myths.\"\n \n Update: News coverage of the Long Island mom accused of sending sex-crazed men to her daughter's nine-year-old classmate is apparently lacking what some say is a key piece of information: the fact the alleged perpetrator is a heterosexual who lives with a \"straight\" man. Where's the media frenzy? Why do all these reports hide that important fact?\n \n Okay, I'll stop with the red ink. It makes my eyes hurt.\n \n Tags: Hauppauge NY, Heterosexual Agenda, New York\n \n For related information, see Heterosexual Agenda\n \n \n Heterosexual Menace: Teaching Heterosexuality In The Public Schools\n Jim Burroway\n May 29th, 2009\n If opposite-sex marriage becomes legal, then they'll be teaching heterosexuality to your children in the public schools:\n \n \n Radical heterosexualist Melissa Weber\n A middle school teacher has been arrested after authorities said she had sexual trysts with a 14-year-old student in a Queens classroom after school.\n \n Social studies teacher Melissa Weber was awaiting arraignment late Thursday on rape, sexual abuse and child endangerment charges. Prosecutors don't know whether she has a lawyer, and no telephone number can be found for her home.\n \n Prosecutors say Weber had sex with the boy seven times at M.S./I.S. 8 this month and last. Prosecutors say the teen's mother heard about the liaison Wednesday and found hundreds of contacts with the 27-year-old teacher in her son's cell phone.\n \n There's more heterosexual menace here and in our report, \"The Heterosexual Agenda: Exposing the Myths.\"\n \n COMMENTS (5) | LINK\n Heterosexual Menace: Can't Get Pregnant? Pimp Your Daughter\n Jim Burroway\n April 2nd, 2009\n There's more than one way to be pro-family. Like this couple from Pennsylvania:\n \n A Uniontown woman accused of drugging a 13-year-old girl so a man could try to impregnate the teen said nothing Thursday as she was led to jail, but her minister said he feels that she is innocent of the charges. Uniontown police said Shana K. Brown, 32, and Duane Calloway, 40, concocted the plan to surreptitiously impregnate the girl because Brown can't have more children.\n \n ...Brown, accompanied by her minister, turned herself in to police yesterday. She declined comment as she was led to jail in handcuffs. Her minister, the Rev. John Harris of Uniontown's Church of God in Christ, said he believes Brown is innocent.\n \n Calloway is also in custody. It's good to know the couple have God on their side. What else are heterosexuals doing to protect the family?

Quick (left) and Samantha Light (right).\n \n From Indiana:\n \n A couple who ran a baby-sitting service out of their home videotaped themselves performing sex acts with children, some as young as 2 months old, police said Friday. Stephen E. Quick, 31, and Samantha Light, 25, both of Veedersburg in western Indiana, were being held on $100,000 bond in Fountain County Jail. Both faced preliminary charges of child molestation and child exploitation. Jail staff did not know whether either one had an attorney. Police who searched the couple's home found a videotape depicting sex acts involving Quick and Light and at least four different children between the ages of 2 months and 6 years old, said Fountain County Sheriff's Deputy Bob Kemp.\n \n ...Deputies seized several computers, cameras, a video camera, pornographic materials, drugs and drug paraphernalia. Several sex toys that appeared in the video were seized during a second search, police said.\n \n I love the names Quick and Light. It almost sounds downright Christian somehow. There's a video report here. And here they think we're the ones recruiting!\n \n I know it's hard to keep up, but we try to keep tabs on all of the dangerous things those heterosexuals are doing here and in our report, \"The Heterosexual Agenda: Exposing the Myths.\" \n \n [Hat tip: BTB reader Louie]\n \n Tags: Heterosexual Agenda, Indiana\n \n For related information, see Aside, Heterosexual Agenda\n \n \n COMMENTS (6) | LINK\n Heterosexual Menace: Two Utah Teachers Seduce Same Young Boy\n Jim Burroway\n March 7th, 2009\n \n Valynne Bowers (left) and Linda Nef (right)\n \n Must be all that porn:\n \n Two Bountiful Junior High School teachers are accused of sexually assaulting the same 13-year-old student, after their separate relationships with him spiraled from personal conversations to the exchange of sexual text messages and phone sex, authorities said.\n \n On Friday, the Davis County Attorney's Office filed first-degree felony charges of rape and sodomy on a child against Linda R. Nef, 46, and Valynne Bowers, 39.\n \n Nef, a Utah studies teacher and cheerleading adviser, and Bowers, who teaches math, each confessed to having sex with the student, said Bountiful Police Lt. Randy Pickett. Until recently, the two teachers did not know about each other's relationship with the same boy, Pickett said.\n \n According to Utah law, these two teachers can fight it out over who wins the affections of the thirteen-year-old student in another five years. And according to Utah law, that then-eighteen-year-old can even pick one and marry her, conviction and all (assuming it comes to that). But same sex partners don't have the right to even visit each other in the hospital if one should fall seriously ill.\n \n You can read keep tabs on what those dangerous heterosexuals are up to here and in our report, \"The Heterosexual Agenda: Exposing the Myths.\"\n \n [Hat tip: reader Louie]\n \n Tags: Bountiful UT, Heterosexual Agenda, Utah\n \n For related information, see Aside, Heterosexual Agenda\n \n \n Email this \u0095 DEL.ICO.US \u0095 DIGG \u0095 FARK \u0095 REDDIT \u0095 STUMBLE \u0095 TECHNORATI \u0095 TWITTER \u0095 Share on Facebook\n \n \n COMMENTS (4) | LINK\n Heterosexual Menace: The Real Threat In Schools\n Jim Burroway\n February 3rd, 2009\n Peter LaBarbera has his hair on fire over openly gay Ron Huberman being named CEO of Chicago's public schools. He's afraid that Huberman's appointment will send a message that being gay is \"normative to impressionable Chicago students.\" Perhaps LaBarbera should show more concern about some very direct messages - in the form of text messages - that some educators are sending to young impressionable students:\n \n 49-year-old female teacher from a Phoenix elementary school was arrested at a hotel Saturday after luring a 14-year-old boy there through text messages that portrayed herself as a sexually active teenager, according to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. Rosanna Brown of Chandler, an English teacher at Ed Pastor Elementary School, 2101 W. Alta Vista Road, admitted to having sexual relations with the boy, according to the sheriff's office.\n \n ... Brown had checked into the hotel on Saturday and when the boy arrived at the hotel, he claimed the room was dark, and believed he was having sex with a teenage girl, [Sheriff Joe] Arpaio said. But then the boy realized it was his English teacher, Arpaio told the Tribune.\n \n You can read more about the misery and emptiness of the heterosexual lifestyle here and in our report, \"The Heterosexual Agenda: Exposing the Myths.\"\n \n \n COMMENTS (2) | LINK\n Heterosexual Menace: Shock Collars, Shootings, Incest - But No Gay Adoption\n Jim Burroway\n February 2nd, 2009\n From Xenia, Ohio, we have a father who disciplined his children by using shock collars:\n \n The Caesarscreek Twp. man who used a shock collar and water torture to discipline three of his four children was sentenced to 16 years in prison by Greene County Common Pleas Court Judge J. Timothy Campbell Monday. David O. Liskany, 39, of Hussey Road, was sentenced to six years each for two counts of second-degree felonious assault and to four years for one count of third-degree attempted felonious assault.\n \n \"The only thing you didn't do was wrap their faces in cheesecloth. They basically were waterboarded,\" Campbell said before handing down his sentence, which was far harsher than the 4 years in prison recommended by state probation authorities. According to Campbell, Liskany abused three of his four children - who were 13, 11 and four at the time of the abuse - by using a dog's shock collar on them, holding them underwater, subjecting them to cold showers and spraying water up their noses.\n \n Authorities found out when the older boy ran away from home, walking fifteen miles to a relative. Liskany's ex-wife Wendy Liskany pleaded for the court to not jail her ex-husband. \"I don't feel that incarcerating him will help,\" she said.\n \n Maybe Liskany had to use such creative measures because they spoiled their children when they were younger. These parents from New York were determined not to make that mistake:\n \n A 5-month-old child is in critical condition Saturday in what police suspect is a child abuse case. Police say they have charged the girl's father, Scott Archbold, 41, with causing the injuries including multiple bone fractures, internal bleeding and signs of prior abuse. Christina Benjamin, (above right) the infant's mother, has been charged with child endangerment for allegedly failing to get the child medical attention after the infant's grandmother suspected the abuse.\n \n But at least Liskany and the Archbold-Benjamins didn't just kill their entire families outright.\n \n Armed with a handgun, [Ervin Antonio] Lupoe evidently roamed room to room starting as early as Monday evening, fatally shooting his wife and five young children - including two sets of twins.\n \n Early Tuesday, Lupoe faxed a bitter, rambling two-page letter to a local television station blaming his employer for his actions. Though his wife and children were already dead, he also called the station threatening to kill his family, investigators believe. He followed this up with an incongruous call to police saying that he had returned home and that \"my whole family has been shot.\"\n \n Fortunately, not all heterosexuals are so violent. This father loved his daughter so much, he had four children by her. He didn't care much for his grandchildren-children though:\n \n The father, Danial Rinehart, 47, is scheduled to appear in court Thursday. Authorities say three of the four babies he fathered by the second-oldest daughter, who is now 19, are dead. A 3-year-old boy is alive and in state custody. Rinehart is charged with second-degree felony murder, child endangerment, two counts of incest and two counts of abandonment of a corpse. The remains of two infants were found in chest-type coolers.\n \n His wife, Linda Rinehart, is charged with child endangerment. Authorities say she was jealous of the relationship between her husband and daughter but helped with the babies' deliveries.\n \n Obviously, we need to put a stop to this sort of abusive family dynamics. That's why a Tennessee state legislator is introducing legislation to ban adoption by same-sex parents. It's also why a West Virginia judge thinks a 2-year-old girl would be much better off if she were ripped from the only parents she has ever known. Her lesbian fostor parents have cared for her since birth and now want to adopt her.\n \n You can read more about the misery and emptiness of the heterosexual lifestyle here and in our report, \"The Heterosexual Agenda: Exposing the Myths.\"\n \n COMMENTS (4) | LINK\n Heterosexual Menace: There's Hope In Jesus\n Jim Burroway\n January 14th, 2009\n Usually we use these heterosexual menace posts to highlight the many tragic ways in which heterosexuals pose a serious threat to society's morals and health, as they pursue their empty lifestyles of misery, hopelessness and loneliness.\n \n The good news is that heterosexuals don't have to be victims of their compulsions. A new organization, Leviticus International, stands ready to help millions find true freedom in their struggle with heterosexuality. According to the web site, \"Jesus Christ has the power to end heterosexuals' misery and make them happy well-adjusted gays.\"\n \n You can read more about the misery and emptiness of the heterosexual lifestyle here and in our report, \"The Heterosexual Agenda: Exposing the Myths.\"\n \n Tags: Heterosexual Agenda, Satire\n \n For related information, see Aside, Heterosexual Agenda\n \n \n Email this \u0095 DEL.ICO.US \u0095 DIGG \u0095 FARK \u0095 REDDIT \u0095 STUMBLE \u0095 TECHNORATI \u0095 TWITTER \u0095 Share on Facebook\n \n \n COMMENTS (3) | LINK\n Heterosexual Menace: Exodus 21:7 Returns\n Jim Burroway\n January 13th, 2009\n In today's verse we read this in Exodus 21:7-11, in which God himself told Moses:\n \n \"If a man sells his daughter as a servant, she is not to go free as menservants do. If she does not please the master who has selected her for himself, he must let her be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to foreigners, because he has broken faith with her. If he selects her for his son, he must grant her the rights of a daughter. If he marries another woman, he must not deprive the first one of her food, clothing and marital rights. If he does not provide her with these three things, she is to go free, without any payment of money.\n \n In today's news, we read:\n \n Police have arrested a Greenfield [California] man for allegedly arranging to sell his 14-year-old daughter into marriage in exchange for $16,000, 100 cases of beer and several cases of meat. Police say they only learned of the deal after 36-year-old Marcelino de Jesus Martinez went to them to get his daughter back because payment wasn't made as promised. Martinez was arrested Sunday on suspicion of human trafficking.\n \n Officers also arrested 18-year-old Margarito de Jesus Galindo on suspicion of statutory rape. Investigators believe the girl went willingly with Galindo, but she's under California's legal age of consent and can't legally marry. Police say arranged marriages involving underage girls have become a problem in this small Central Coast farming community.\n \n Now you see, if de Jesus had only followed the Biblical model and paid the man, he wouldn't be in trouble with the police right now.\n \n You can read more examples of the heterosexual menace here, and in our report, \"The Heterosexual Agenda: Exposing the Myths.\"\n \n COMMENTS (5) | LINK\n Heterosexual Menace: Now Elementary School Teachers Are Recruiting Children!!!\n Jim Burroway\n January 12th, 2009\n A married elementray school teacher in Abington, MA has been arrested and charged with seven counts of statutory rape of a teen. The boy was thirteen years old when he lost his virginity to Christine A. McCallum, 29, a teacher at an Abington elementary school. McCallum plied the boy with alcohol and had her way with him an estimated 300 times. According to the now-sixteen year old teen, this went on for about 18 months, about every other day. The seven counts in the indictments represent specific incidents that police were able to document.\n \n Some of these trysts happened in the teacher's home as her husband slept upstairs. She also wrote him passionate love letters, some of which are now in police custody. McCallum's neighbors, of course, who are also probably all heterosexuals themselves since Abington is an overwhelmingly heterosexual community, all claimed they didn't know what was going on.\n \n You can read more about what heterosexuals really want here, and in our report, \"The Heterosexual Agenda: Exposing the Myths.\"\n \n [Hat tip: Peter, who read this halfway around the world in Australia.]\n \n Tags: Heterosexual Agenda\n \n For related information, see Aside, Heterosexual Agenda\n \n \n Email this \u0095 DEL.ICO.US \u0095 DIGG \u0095 FARK \u0095 REDDIT \u0095 STUMBLE \u0095 TECHNORATI \u0095 TWITTER \u0095 Share on Facebook\n \n \n COMMENTS (6) | LINK\n Heterosexual Menace: Christian Missionary Impregnates Daughter\n Jim Burroway\n December 22nd, 2008\n Saddleback Pastor Rick Warren recently compared same-sex marriage to incest. That was taken as an insult by gay activists. Maybe we misunderstood him. Maybe it was meant to be a compliment:\n \n A Christian missionary who impregnated his 17-year-old daughter was sentenced to 12.5 years in prison Monday. The 44-year-old man was convicted by a Pima County [Arizona] jury last month of four counts of sexual conduct with a minor and one count of child abuse. According to court documents, the daughter called the Tucson Police Department last summer and told detectives that her father had been sexually abusing her since the age of 12.\n \n The girl said that her father and mother were Christian missionaries who traveled from state-to-state and much of the abuse had occurred in Colorado and Arizona.\n \n Oh, and get this:\n \n Her mother learned of the abuse by reading her diary, but instead of confronting the father, the girl said her mother threw her diary out of a car window.\n \n ...She said her father told her God told him to have sex with her and she should think of him as her husband.

When I was in school, I had to learn to fight to protect myself from people who wanted to hurt me because I dared to wear a gay pride shirt. There were occasions when I protected others who were being hurt. Mentally challenged people, gay kids. How the hell is beating up someone because of a shirt they wear or a very low IQ right? One kid ended up in the hospital because I was very sick and not in school. I was one of a few bodyguards for the GSA kids, the dorks, and the special kids.\n \n 3. To accept everyone who is different. Right now, I'm not in a church because I have not found one open to people of a different sexuality. Where I used to live, there was a church like every blocks.

Our technology cannot change the past (YET!!!), so the claim towards historical significance has value no matter our means and methods today. \n \n Even beyond that point, a desire for what is natural is a built-in desire. Even our sense of aesthetic is rooted in our reproductive success, unless you're a post-modernist (which some of your attitude suggests) who believes beauty has no place in art. Studies of peoples' visual tastes have found recurring motifs in the sights that give people pleasure such as motifs of optimal human habitats, and the enjoyment of the forms of living things. \n \n Additionally, city beautifications usually include renovating parks and planting trees in otherwise sterile city settings. With our technology we can create cities that are \"engines of living\" with spaces optimally utilized, but they are painful to live in. Technology is not enough... human nature must be taken into account. We are not tabula rasas as Locke would have you believe.\n \n \nI'm sorry, but we're not just breeding stock.

Take the example of rape: rape is a feature of human nature and the interests of women to not be raped is also a feature of human nature. It is inherent in our value system that women are not subordinate to the desires of men so rape is not tolerated.

   "The individual won't get to the point of being able to reproduce, if it isn't supported.\n\n \n I'm not sure what you mean. Different creatures have different methods of achieving the goal of successful reproduction (with or without 'support') but it still remains the same goal. \n \n Certainly companions can enter into a cost-benefit analysis who may survive where I do not and push the result into the satisfactory outcome definition for conflict, but this does not apply to reproduction.

Sexual recombination is the method to transmit genetic traits through generations. Evolution is a physical mechanism whereby a greater number of successfully reproducing copies of your own genes indicates greater 'fitness' in a certain environment. It can be reproduced mathematically. What 'further' is there?\n \n \nIt's a way of fullfilling the same thing, reproduction.\n\n \n Again, I'm talking in an evolutionary sense. Artificial insemination relates to evolution the way that welfare relates to pure capitalism. They don't. Evolution, for example, deals with courtship and attracting mates, so going to a sperm bank would exist outside of this framework. Similarly, immaculate conception would exist outside of the framework of attracting a mate to reproduce. Cloning (without mutation) would also be outside of the framework of evolution. Sorry.\n \n Think of it this way: Our bodies were built with gravity in mind. The fact that our technology can send us into space does not change that fact.\n \n \nAn \"innate belief\"? No, it's your personal belief.\n\n \n That is why I prefaced it with \"I believe[...]\". It is my opinion that at least part of the resistance that actually exists is due to an innate belief that heterosexual attraction serves more of a purpose to us as a species than other types of relationships. Since this is objectively true as well I believe there is support for the contention that people think about it even though I have no direct evidence.\n \n This is the implication I spoke of, and I think any pro-gay propaganda would benefit from acknowledgement of this.\n \n \nYou're assuming there is only one purpose for sex. Certainly many heterosexuals and gay people disagree. You're really making a dogmatic statement to that effect. That question of determining one ultimate purpose is answered by your subjective philosophy or religion.\n\n \n I certainly believe no such thing. If you'll notice, I'm referring to reproduction, not sex. Sex is the natural mechanism for reproduction so they absolutely are related, but I do not equate the two. Even were I to equate them, you would be confusing ultimate and proximate causality. The proximate cause of sex is whatever the reason was we wanted to have sex. The moment to moment stream-of-consciousness that led up to the act itself. The ultimate cause is why it evolved. Sex evolved to enable sexual recombination of genes (read: reproduction).

   "This is exactly the point that I was making in another thread.\n Homosexuals are keen to condemn other unnatural sexual persuasions and set themselves apart from them. My argument was that once society accepts homosexuality as being acceptable as hetrosexuality then we why should we not accept incest then pedophilia?\n One could make a case of accepting sexual relationships between father and daughter, sister and brother,son and mother just as strong as accepting same sex relationships as equal to heterosexual ones.\n\n \n Yes and no. The reason incestual relationships are not generally accepted is rooted in our psychology since, on evolutionary terms, it is disadvantagous to produce children within a family line and so that type of behavior would be selected against. That would not change even if any and all laws were dropped concerning incest. However, on purely theoretical grounds you would be correct that a de-emphasis on reproduction weakens the argument that incestual relationships pose an unacceptable risk to any children of such a union (referring, of course, to the 'deadly' recessive gene combination).\n \n In the end it hardly matters since, as I said, our own psychology would limit instances to a small minority.\n \n \nIf society accepts this then why should a 12 year old girl not be allowed to marry a fully grown man?

   "Thanks for pointing to this thread Jake, it's the first time I have seen it or read any of it.\n \n What an interesting correlation sigma has exposed here in showing the hypocrisy of you judging and condemning pedophiles for being practitioners of unnatural sex acts when you, as a homosexual can be categorized in exactly the same way. You know, as a practitioner of unnatural sex acts. The question is, how can you justify the double standard you define and not see that just as you consider pedophelia to be a sick and perverted act of unnatural origins, that is exactly how we heteros view homosexuality?\n\n \n \nA little bit of a grand claim. There are many straight people who are sympathetic to the pro-gay movement so this would be factually incorrect. Also, the view that homosexuality is sick and perverted does not appear to be the majority view. I would hazard that while the current lack of progress is due to a view that heterosexual attraction is in some way \"special\", this does not necessarily or automatically indicate a negative view of homosexuality.\n \n Your negative association of \"unnatural\" with homosexuality is a subjective notion.\n\n \n First off, when did I state a specific percentage of the population which believes as I do about the unnatural and perverted character of homosexuality as a lifestyle? Reread my post and see that it doesn't require a majority opinion for an observation and belief to be correct. So I don't require a consensus in order to clarify my beliefs just as you didn't require one when you made your point to Jake. \n \n It also seems kind of contradictory to disagree with someone who is agreeing with the premise of the very point you were making. emoticon_rolleyes",

Our mind divides the world into categories, and infers information since it does not have direct access to it.

Different creatures have different methods of achieving the goal of successful reproduction (with or without 'support') but it still remains the same goal. \n \n Certainly companions can enter into a cost-benefit analysis who may survive where I do not and push the result into the satisfactory outcome definition for conflict, but this does not apply to reproduction. If copies of your genes are not passed down into the next generation then your individual strategy was a failure, in an evolutionary sense.\n \n \n \n Again, I'm not sure what you're trying to get at. Sexual recombination is the method to transmit genetic traits through generations. Evolution is a physical mechanism whereby a greater number of successfully reproducing copies of your own genes indicates greater 'fitness' in a certain environment. It can be reproduced mathematically. What 'further' is there?\n \n \n \n Again, I'm talking in an evolutionary sense. Artificial insemination relates to evolution the way that welfare relates to pure capitalism. They don't. Evolution, for example, deals with courtship and attracting mates, so going to a sperm bank would exist outside of this framework. Similarly, immaculate conception would exist outside of the framework of attracting a mate to reproduce. Cloning (without mutation) would also be outside of the framework of evolution. Sorry.\n \n Think of it this way: Our bodies were built with gravity in mind. The fact that our technology can send us into space does not change that fact.\n \n \n \n That is why I prefaced it with \"I believe[...]\". It is my opinion that at least part of the resistance that actually exists is due to an innate belief that heterosexual attraction serves more of a purpose to us as a species than other types of relationships. Since this is objectively true as well I believe there is support for the contention that people think about it even though I have no direct evidence.\n \n This is the implication I spoke of, and I think any pro-gay propaganda would benefit from acknowledgement of this.\n \n \n \n I certainly believe no such thing. If you'll notice, I'm referring to reproduction, not sex. Sex is the natural mechanism for reproduction so they absolutely are related, but I do not equate the two. Even were I to equate them, you would be confusing ultimate and proximate causality. The proximate cause of sex is whatever the reason was we wanted to have sex. The moment to moment stream-of-consciousness that led up to the act itself. The ultimate cause is why it evolved. Sex evolved to enable sexual recombination of genes (read: reproduction). My \"subjective philosophy or religion\" is my study of evolution.\n\n \n You're still trying to put one \"meaning\" or \"purpose\" for sex, in asking the one \"why\" it evolved. Sex does many things. Also, heterosexuals who don't reproduce but still have sex are allowed to marry and stay married. Thus, I doubt this is the reason some straight people don't accept gay marriage.",

   "You're still trying to put one \"meaning\" or \"purpose\" for sex, in asking the one \"why\" it evolved. Sex does many things. Also, heterosexuals who don't reproduce but still have sex are allowed to marry and stay married. \n\n \n As I said, you're confusing proximate and ultimate cause. Since reproduction appears a sore point with you, lets try a topic less touchy but still has application. \n \n Reciprocal altruism can explain why the social and moralistic emotions evolved. Sympathy and trust prompt people to extend the first favor. Gratitude and loyalty prompt them to repay favors. Guilt and shame deter them from hurting or failing to repay others. Anger and contept prompt them to avoid or punish cheaters. Partnerships, friendships , alliances and communities can emerge, cemented by these emotions and concerns. \n \n To imagine that this talk about costs and benefits implies that people are Machiavellian cynics that calculate the genetic advantages of befriending, mating and marrying is to confuse proximate and ultimate causation. People don't care about their genes; they care about happiness, love, power, respect and other passions. The cost-benefit analysis is a metaphorical way of describing the selection of alternative genes over millennia, not a literal description of what takes place in a human brain in real-time.\n \n A mechanical description of reproduction and sex (and the reason it would have evolved) does not imply that sex cannot be used socially. I have no idea why you keep pushing this idea.\n \n \nThus, I doubt this is the reason some straight people don't accept gay marriage.\n\n \n I have nothing vested in the result either way, but I do think you make a mistake when you discount the significance of heterosexual attraction",

   "Has it? I am of the opinion that the current barrier to equality is psychological more than purely logical. \n \n Also, psychological barriers are not be-all end-all and neither are they insurmountable. Studies have shown the psychology of disgust when people have an aversion to touching cockaroaches even if they have been sanitized, but this psychological barrier can be overcome.\n \n \n \n This reinforces my claim. Our mind divides the world into categories, and infers information since it does not have direct access to it. We observe properties, assign it to a category and from that category predict properties that we cannot observe. Contents of the world are not just there for the knowing but have to be grasped with suitable mental machinery. People do not ordinarily test each other's DNA to determine kinship. They must do it through indirect means. Animals do it by smell, and humans do it through several kinds of information: who grows up together, who resembles whom, how people interact, what reliable sources say, and what can be logically deduced from other kin relationships.\n \n People have sex and marry those with whom they interact the most and those of the same class, religion, race and appearance. The forces of sexual attraction should pull siblings together like magnets, and there should be millions of brothers and sisters wanting to have sex and get married. Instead there are virtually none in our society, in any well-studied human society or in most animals in the wild. Avoiding incest is universal even if incest taboos are not. There are sound biological reasons for this, if you wish me to explain it further.\n \n Your example is a loophole in our kin-detecting mental software, nothing more.\n \n \n \n Aye, and if they were brought up together as kin then that attraction would not exist because be have a biological aversion to incest.\n \n \n \n Explain further please\n \n \n \n Explain the difference in how you are using them\n\n \n \n However much you moot over it the fact that siblings as well as parents and children have had sexual relationships where both parties have been more than willing to participate.

You're passing a moral judgement upon the state of being of a 'class' of people because of the attraction they have. Their orientations, not their actions, are wrong therefore we have to 'fix' them. All I'm doing is pointing out the prejudice. I don't care if you think it's justified.\n \n \nReproduction can't get anywhere without survival and vice-versa. These things work together.

This isn't a quibble over which way to reproduce because there is only one way to naturally reproduce. That's the point.\n \n Survival is only relevent if the organism reproduces. Survival without reproduction is a failed strategy. Our genes create behaviors that enhance their own chance at propagation. Any strategy that does not achieve that end cannot be passed on to the next generation and therefore necessarily dies out (in reality it is more complicated than this, but what I stated is essentially true).\n \n \nWith your argument it's only important if it leads to reproduction.

The most compelling, to me, is that homosexuality in males is a side-effect of increased fecundity in the females of the line. This mechanism is similar to sexual dimorphism (leading to secondary sexual characteristics) and is called sexual antagonism. While it would be incorrect that there is no reproduction from homosexual individuals (it must happen sometimes) I would expect that the primary source would be from the female line. The problem with this theory is that it would suggest that more homosexual individuals exist than is believed to be the case so some sort of partial penetrance effect is likely in effect.\n \n The sexual antagonistic effect has been recorded in Drosophila where 'fit' individuals produce non-'fit' offspring regularly, suggesting it is a mechanism that creates variation.",

   "GLSEN'S 'FISTGATE' IN MASSACHUSETTS\n The most notorious education scandal involving homosexual activists is a GLSEN-sponsored conference that occurred on March 25, 2000, dubbed \"Fistgate\" by conservatives. Three homosexual activists employed by the Massachusetts Departments of Health and Education led a youth workshop titled \"What They Didn't Tell You about XXXXX Sex & Sexuality in Health Class\" - part of the annual Boston-GLSEN \"Teach Out\" conference held at Tufts University. The \"XXXXX Sex\" session, advertised to \"youth only ages 14 to 21,\" was attended by Massachusetts family advocate Scott Whitemen, who taped it while standing in the back of the room. \n \n \n \n \n In the workshop, instructor Michael Gaucher, prompted by a teen's question, verbally guided the students on the mechanics of \"fisting\" - a homosexual slang term for a sadistic sex act in which a man inserts his hand and arm into another person's anal cavity. Another instructor, Margot Abels5, said fisting \"often gets a really bad rap,\" and described it innocuously as \"an experience of letting somebody into your body that you want to be that close and intimate with.\" Abels and Gaucher also guided the students on techniques of oral sodomy and lesbian sex.6 \n \n \n \n \n Other panels at the Boston-GLSEN conference - which is still at the center of litigation due to Whiteman's taping of the workshop7 - included: \n \n \n \n \n \n Ask the Transsexuals \n \n Early Childhood Educators: How to Decide Whether to Come Out [as a Homosexual] at Work or Not \n \n Lesbian Avengers: How to Promote XXXXX-Friendly Activism in Your Schools and in Your Lives \n \n The Struggles and Triumphs of Including Homosexuality in a Middle School Curriculum \n \n The Religious Wrong: Dealing Effectively with Opposition in Your Community8\n \n \n Concerned Women for America - When Silence Would Have Been Golden",

Anonymous question cards also help guarantee that the material being asked is the students' agenda rather than the adults. \n \n Ms. Ables provided me with a list of the questions they asked, which she had typed up because the teachers who were present at the next workshop felt it important to know what gay youth wanted to know. \n \n \"These are typed as written originally by the students. \n \n Is oral sex better with tongue rings? P.S. I hope so. \n Cum? Calories? Spit versus swallow? Health concerns? \n What age do most GLB first have sex? Is it different from the age of straight kids? \n What is an anal ball? \n Should some kind of protection be used in lesbian sex? \n Women's vaginal wall can expand to any dick size... Can anal walls do the same? \n Are girls who primarily like guys and are only attracted to other girls sexually (not in the love-y) way considered bisexual? \n How is protection used in lesbian sex since it's mostly oral, where does the protection go? \n My ex said she enjoys pain, what the hell is that about? \n What is fisting? \n Define fetish. \n What is lesbian sex anyway? \n How do I find out if someone is bi? Homo? \n What are the technicalities of transsexual and hermaphrodite sex? \n How long do you have to wait to get tested for HIV or any STD after the \"act\" is committed? \n A question on the ethics of oral sex: would it be considered rude not to swallow? \n Can you answer the fish question? \n Do lesbians rub their clits together? Is that even sex? \n How do GLB kids determine loss of virginity?\" \n The procedure for this exercise was to read the questions in the order they arrived in on the pile of question cards, to turn the question back to the group so peers could do some of the education, and then to add, clarify, or correct any misinformation. \n Ms. Ables described Michael as an actor, very dramatic and entertaining. She said that youth love him because he presents information in a lively and humorous manner. He did most of the education on about where and how to you get tested for HIV, the different kinds of tests there are for HIV, on HIV/AIDS treatment, and responded to questions about transmission risk for different people, sexual practices and lesbian sex. At one point he was writing on the board demonstrating the differences between the Western Blot and ELISA tests. \n \n The youth seemed to have a good understanding of the importance of safety in sexual activity. One of the questions was, -- \"Is it rude to spit after oral sex?\" One of the students answered \"whether or not it's rude, it's good HIV prevention to not swallow.\" \n \n There was a long talk about how to make decisions around sex activity and how to decide when to begin sexual activity. They didn't talk about abstinence in this context, but \"postponement.\" They talked about not making a decision to enter any sexual activity until you're ready, and discussed how someone might know that they are ready. They discussed that for some people sexual activity has feelings attached to it, and for others, it's just physical. They discussed the context of making decisions about sex, with knowledge about what those choices were about sexual activity and emotional maturity and other things. Ms. Ables reports that they asked the youths, \"How do you make those decisions? As you think about it, you might find it's not the right time for you.\" \n \n There were a couple of subjects in which they purposely avoided making or implying value judgements. The questions when to become sexually active, what is fisting, and a question about sadomasochism were answered as factually as possible to avoid stigmatizing anyone in the room who participated in those behaviors, and to maintain the educational atmosphere that there is no shame in asking questions or talking about anything. Therefore, both Mr. Gaucher and Ms. Ables described the practice of \"fisting\" in an accurate way. \n \n As with all the questions, they turned it first back to the students.One student said that fisting was \"slamming your fist up into somebody.\" That is a factually inaccurate statement, and they didn't want that kind of judgement and image left in the minds of these youth, so they both answered it - \"not to encourage it -- we gave them clear messages that some people like it and most don't.\" That \"it's not painful and we didn't want people there or their friends to be judged\" on the basis of inaccurate information. \n \n They responded the same way when there was a question about sadomasochism. \"We made it clear that for some people that's what they're interested in, and for many people it's not what they want to be doing. We didn't want people who engage in non-traditional activities to feel judged, but in no way did we say 'go out and try this' because we wanted to make people who weren't interested in it to feel just as good and not judged [for their decision not to participate in these activities.]\" \n \n One question asked by the youth was \"Is oral sex better with tongue rings?\" Another youth answered, \"I have one. My girlfriend has one. It is.\" \n \n One young woman stated at one point that people don't even know what vaginas look like, and jumped to the board to draw one. It was \"anatomically inaccurate.\" The presenters made a joke about the size of the clitoris so as not to embarrass the student, and then corrected the misinformation. \n \n They talked about at what age most gay kids have sex. They talked about the statistics from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey - (http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dash/yrbs/survey99.htm ) and asked the students why they though gay kids had sex at a younger age than their heterosexual peers. The students primarily hypothesized that it might be because of the isolation, or ignorance, or acting out, only one student said that she became aware of her desire, thought it was a good thing and wanted to try it. \n \n \"One kid asked about resources - he said he was sexually active at 14 and now at 15, he was thinking that he was disconnected from people as people\" and was thinking that he needed to not be sexual. He asked after about dating, how to find a community, how to find a boyfriend. He was supported in choosing to not be sexual, and \"after the workshop Mr. Gaucher went with him to the table and connected him with peer support groups for gay youth.\" \n \n THE WORKSHOP ENDED BY ENCOURAGING THEM TO FIND ADULTS THEY could talk to and ask questions to.\n\n Bridges-Across: Cindy Beal - Context Matters",

What happened: A more complete description of the workshop \"What They Didn't Tell You About XXXXX Sex & Sexuality In Health Class: A Workshop For Youth Only Ages 14-21\" \n \n I asked Margot Ables to recall for me what was involved in the workshop. The quotes are of her recollection. \n \n The three presenters were invited by GLSEN to lead a workshop in which students would be able to ask questions they could not ask in their local schools. Given that for the most part sexuality education in schools is driven by a heterosexual definition of sex, and it is not safe for gay students to come out or even appear to be gay by asking questions specific to their own lives, this was intended to be that opportunity. A great part of \"safer sex\" education is providing youth with full information about sex and sexuality. \n \n The overarching model of the workshop was a typical one recognizable by any of us who do any workshops for youth on any subject -- to have the youth bring up issues, let them answer the questions for one another as much as possible, and then correct misinformation or add crucial information.\n\n \n Providing information is not promoting sex. It's actually quite necessary. We could just as well argue, that keeping it a dirty little secret, or the worst kept secret, referred to often inaccurately, makes it more appealing and promotes it as something that is somewhat mysterious and forbidden. Like I said, the youth already know of the existence of sex. Do you think not telling kids how pregnancy and stds occur is going to stop them from getting pregnant or getting stds?",

But that involves repentance from gay sex sin - something you and the vast majority of gay sinners continue to refuse to do. So that's your idol..\n\n \n Idol? Easy have I not made it clear my profession and love for Christ? Or do you refuse to acknowledge that Gay people can also be Christian as well? I assume it must be so seeing as you have closed your heart to us altogether...\n \n \n \n \nDoes that mean adultery is ok now too? Pedophilia? Fornication? Since the Bible has been used to justify anything from slavery, to segregation, to the denial of Women's rights, then according to your logic all these other sins must be ok too - not just gay sex sin. \n \n Get a grip. These pseudo-intellectual arguments of yours are full of lies..\n\n \n Not in the narrow minded context you paint it as. The sin of homosexuality in the Bible stemmed once again from the practice used as a form of worship to a FLASE god by Israel's enemies of the time. There were no modern same sex monogamous relationships such as you see today in anceint times. At least not in a prominent light.\n \n \n \n\n <FLUSH<\n \n You're doing everything in your power to lead people down to perdition by telling them gay sex is okay. It's not, and you're poisioning people's hearts and souls by leading them astray with this disgusting, carnal perversion.\n\n \n Astray? And your message leading to suicide and self loathing and inner bitter hatred is better??? Do not judge or call my actions and beliefs as leading others down a road of darkness unless you have traveled that road that I and many other Gay peoples of faith have trodden....",

   "Face the Truth -- \"Gays\" Recruit \n \n Every day in this country, hundreds of young people try out homosexual behavior for the very first time. In some cases, these experiments are with peers, but very often the sexual partner is an older person (sometimes much older) who has already identified himself or herself as \"gay.\" Most of us think of recruitment as the seduction of an innocent, perhaps emotionally vulnerable child or youth by an older sexual predator. Consider, however, that even homosexual experimentation between peers can be evidence of \"gay\" recruitment.

In the truest sense of the word, \"gay\" recruitment is a process of changing someone's attitude about sexuality, rendering him or her more likely to take that first step into the \"gay\" lifestyle.

In the relationship between recruitment and seduction we are not necessarily talking about pedophilia (adult/child sex), yet the process of \"gay\" recruitment is very similar to a tactic of pedophiles that psychologists call \"grooming.\" In \"grooming,\" an adult sexual predator will sometimes spend years cultivating a relationship with a child, leading him or her into a sexual relationship only after the child has been thoroughly emotionally and mentally prepared. \"Gay\" recruitment is like \"grooming,\" but it doesn't only occur on a one-to-one basis.\n \n \n The most insidious \"gay\" recruitment is being conducted by \"gay\" propagandists as a nationwide marketing and public relations campaign.

   "You started a trolling thread.\n\n \n Are you JP's parrot?\n \n \nYou advocated grooming of children into perverted sex.\n\n \n That's a lie.\n \n \nYou dug yourself a hole and was stupid enough to keep digging.\n\n \n According to whom? You? I think it was you yourself who dug the hole. You can't argue using any kind of reason. It's just ad-hominems and pursuing your anti-gay agenda.\n \n \nNow you're are reduced to calling me the very thing you are.\n\n \n Hey, we can both use ad-hominem attacks. You started it. I believe in fighting fire with fire.\n \n \nNO ONE has agreed with you .\n There are a few gay people on this site and none of them have typed a word to agree with you.\n That would not be for MY sake because all of them none of them would help me win an argument with a homosexual.\n\n \n Ha, ha. That's your speculation. They may not disagree with me, and they may not agree with you. They may feel I am doing a fine job on my own. No one has agreed with you.\n \n \nNobody seems to agree that we should show 14 year olds dangerous and perverted sexual techniques..gay or straight.\n\n \n You're falsely framing this again by taking what happened out of context. They simply weren't allowing myths and questions generated by the youth themselves, about sex the youth already knew existed, and were talking about; to stand. Not getting answers here, means they may go somewhere else. I know you want to make it into something more sensational than that, to suit your own hardly hidden, anti-gay agenda. \n \n \nYou're on your own.\n\n \n I welcome anyone else to speak up at anytime, as I've always been willing, if they see a flaw in my reasoning.\n \n \nI want to draw a line under this so I will not post any more on the subject.\n I dont need to , you have made my point for me and trying to reason with you is like trying to tell a dog not to lick another dogs arse.It doesnt know betteremoticon_xdonno\n\n \n You haven't shown the ability to do anything other than bark.",
