Do not base it on what others say about God or on what the bible says or the Koran or ... you get the point.\n \n Base it strictly on your own life experiences. I know you may not think God exists or you believe for sure he does not. But given your life, what you remember of it, what would you say that means about who God is.\n \n Thanks, and just so everyone knows, I will not argue with your experiences but I may argue with your conclusions drawn if they are illogical or to challenge you to think of other possibilities.

   "I have had nothing that resembles any kind of experience, or even a hint of experience, of God or a Godlike entity/consciousness. I believe that all the world's religions, from the earliest to the most modern, have nothing to do with what the reality of a godlike consciousness might be. They are human constructs designed to answer questions for which at present we have no answers.\n \n However, there is one thing that the prominent religions have in common that I think they may have right if 'he/she/it' does exist, and that is the idea of omnipresence. To put it simply, if there is a Godlike entity I think it is probably the universe. This is pure conjecture, but I believe the universe could be a conscious entity. Why not? \n \n It would not have thought processes that we as humans could in any way relate to, and given the predictability of physical phenomena according to the laws we have discovered it would not seem to be able to will anything to happen, but it could still have a sense of itself and an awareness of everything within it.\n \n This inability of humans to understand this hypothetical consciousness is why I cannot subscribe to a religion; if 'he/she/it' does exist there is no way any human could possibly understand it, relate to it, communicate with it, or even know that it exists. I doubt very much that it, if it exists, would have any interest in individual human beings; it would see us as purely an extension of the matter that makes up the planet, after all that is essentially what we are.\n \n The whole process of evolution (specifically including abiogenesis) has been the transformation of inanimate minerals and chemicals into living creatures through a mind-bogglingly complex 4 billion-year chemical reaction. We came literally out of the matter of the planet. That matter came from a nebula which was originally part of a long-exploded (population II) star, which formed from a nebula from an older exploded (population I) star, which was born as the galaxies formed from the hydrogen and helium left over by the processes that started it all. In terms of the particles that make up the atoms in our bodies (and everything else), we all come from the same place. \n \n OK I'm completely rambling now but my point is that I do not believe that there is such a thing as a 'God', at least not with any of the connotations that that word has had in the history of human culture. If our brains can be conscious, why not the universe?",

From this singular perspective there is no distinction between the living and the non-living parts of the planet; it's one colossal biochemical reaction.\n \n I will concede that it is possible that this 'God' entity might be aware of our own consciousness, because according to my own logic the entity also is the matter that constitutes our brains, and it is certainly the case that many people believe God has spoken to them. Some of these people are treated as having had religious experiences, some are treated as having lost their sanity. \n \n However this in no way leads me to contemplate the idea that the Bible, Koran, Hindu Vedas etc are any more revelatory truths than are the Greek Myths or the Aboriginal Dreamtime; these are human constructs.

IMHO, that is not debatable, it's fact, observed repeatedly in nature and in captivity.\n \n \nThe evolution of a concious mind is not provable. One can assume evolution of a concious mind but to do so requires a leap of faith. It is not an observable phenomenon. It requires that you believe evolution occured.

I will agree that it can't be proven - given our current level of understanding.\n \n The \"assumption\" that there is not in fact a personal \"god\" is not an assumption at all, it's a logical starting point.\n \n Introducing a personal god and putting him in control is where assumptions begin and logic ends. It's a simple matter of Occam's Razor and the scientific method. Neither requires faith, only logic and intelligence (not meant as a insult, only in that one must be able to understand the science and logic in order for it to be of value).\n \n There have been countless threads on this, and to my knowledge, there has not been any proof or evidence put forward as yet as to god's involvement. I'll leave that door open to you should you decide to attempt to supply it. \n \n IMHO, there is no real debate here.

No. Not to me anyway.\n \n I don't know many people who don't bother with trying to survive in this life because they believe in an afterlife where they will go on forever. I would fear for any person such as that's mental health.\n \n Putting off today in favour of tomorrow will never make sense to me. Even if I had a second life, I'd prefer to live them one at a time, and each to its fullest.\n \n I disagree with your assumptions regarding survival and warfare. Constant warring is not the means by which to best ensure our survival, it's an intentional misrepesentation often chosen to bolster the case for \"god\" over evolution.\n \n As for having more time to care for others - If what you have left, your mark on the world, is what you leave behind, then caring for others and the world around you is of the utmost importance, but you have to survive in order to do so. Selfishness in not inherent in the need or desire to survive.\n \n I'm not sure where else to go with this, IMHO, your premise is artificial. You also haven't really clarified why life is meaningless and hopeless without God, you've only presented the notion that you have more \"free time\" to worry about others if you have an afterlife in place. That may or may not be true, depending on the particular circumstances, but for the most part, I believe it's a false premise.\n \n It would seem to me that our debate boils down to a very simple premise - the natural world around us vs. the supernatural. Everyone is free to make their choice as to where they get their answers. I've made mine based on which choice I felt was the best supported and most logical, but at the same time, I can respect those who've chosen differently.

There is a great deal of evidence for the existence of God. I am not sure that I would characterize it as scientific, but evidence nonetheless. Certainly documentary evidence and writings concerning God go back a long way. The fact that we actually create is evidence for a creator. There are certain miraculous events which cannot be explained by science or can only be speculated upon by science. The raising of the dead, healing of the terminally ill through prayer (I have witnessed this thing on one occasion without any oddball televangists involved) amongst others. While I will admit there are things there we do not understand, they are still EVIDENCE. It does not mean that there are not other possible explanations but they still support the existence of God.\n \n As to my understanding of God. He is relational. He is Love, He is omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent. He is creator, judge, savior, king, prince of peace, wonderful counselor, a strong fortress. He is the beginning and the end, He was before time and will be after time, he brought all things into existence, He defines Good, He is good, he is the lover of my soul. He is my caretaker, my hope and my portion. He is the best thing that ever happened to me.\n \n I do not base my belief in him on something such as the origins of the universe. My belilef is based on the fact that I have tried out what is said to be true about him and found it perfectly sound. I have never been let down by Him and while I cannot always see what He is doing, I am sure that He is involved and has my back.\n \n That is what I believe.\n \n EF",

Effects of private religious activity on mortality of elderly disabled and nondisabled adults. Journal of Gerontology (Medical Sciences) , 55A, M400-M405. \n \n Objective & Design: \n Investigators examined the effects of private religious activities like prayer and Bible study on survival. A random sample of 3,851 community-dwelling adults aged 64-101 years residing in the Piedmont of North Carolina was surveyed in 1986 as part of the NIH Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) program. Private religious activities and a wide variety of sociodemographic and health variables were assessed at baseline. Vital status of members was then determined prospectively over the next six years (1986-1992). Time (days) to death or censoring in days was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards. \n \n Findings: \n During a median 6.3-year follow-up period, 1177 subjects died. Low levels of private religious activity (meditation, prayer, or Bible study) were a significant predictor of mortality in healthy but not disabled subjects. After the investigators controlled for demographics and health status (including depression and stressful life events), persons with no disability and little or no private religious activity in 1986 were 63% more likely to die during the follow-up (HR [hazard ratio] 1.63, 95% CI 1.20-2.21). Even after controlling for social support and health behaviors, investigators found that lack of private religious activity continued to predict a 47% greater risk of dying (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.07-2.03). This study is important because it is one of the first to show an association between private religious activities and longer survival in certain population subgroups. For more information contact: Judy C. Hays (jch@geri.duke.edu) or Harold G. Koenig (koenig@geri.duke.edu). \n \n And there are many more. No these do not prove the existence of god because there are other potential explanations, none of which can be proven either. The next argument that comes is that we take the most reasonable solution. The problem with that is that it is a subjective statement as to what is reasonable and not objective and therefore has little value in a debate where objective standard must determine the outcome.\n \n So, my point is simply that evidence exists. It does not prove it but it exists.\n \n EF",

   "Ahhhhh Very good argumentation. There is a great deal of evidence for the existence of God. I am not sure that I would characterize it as scientific, but evidence nonetheless. Certainly documentary evidence and writings concerning God go back a long way. The fact that we actually create is evidence for a creator. There are certain miraculous events which cannot be explained by science or can only be speculated upon by science. The raising of the dead, healing of the terminally ill through prayer (I have witnessed this thing on one occasion without any oddball televangists involved) amongst others. While I will admit there are things there we do not understand, they are still EVIDENCE. It does not mean that there are not other possible explanations but they still support the existence of God.\n\n \n Sorry EF, I was out of town.\n \n First off - I agree that everything (well almost everything), you've presented can be considered evidence. The question is, is it GOOD evidence? Is it observable, reliable, testable, repeatable, etc...?\n \n Documentary evidence and writings are your best evidence, and as I'm sure you know, they don't form the strongest basis. \n \n The fact that we create is in no way evidence of a creator. That's false logic.\n \n I'm not aware of any documented and scientifically verified cases of anyone being raised from the dead.\n \n \"Miracles\" most often have explanations, where we have no explanation, God can be inserted, but so can anything, including simply, \"I don't know\".\n \n Healing of the terminally ill through prayer is pretty much a dead end street. I think that's been proven in this thread.\n \n I don't doubt the \"power of prayer\" has some positive influence on those that are ill, however, the fact that the prayer is to the Christian God is irrelevent.\n Prayer means the presence of loved ones and a positive atmosphere, IMHO, that affects the mental state of the patient, and that in turn can help in overcoming illness. \n \n All of this \"evidence\" is indeterminate in nature, it could support the existance of God, but it could also support the existance of Thor or the boogeyman. \n \n Alternatively, it could simply be that we don't as yet know the answers, and it isn't evidence of anything.\n \n \nAs to my understanding of God. He is relational. He is Love, He is omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent. He is creator, judge, savior, king, prince of peace, wonderful counselor, a strong fortress. He is the beginning and the end, He was before time and will be after time, he brought all things into existence, He defines Good, He is good, he is the lover of my soul. He is my caretaker, my hope and my portion. He is the best thing that ever happened to me.\n\n \n Interesting.\n \n I have no real objections to your definition, obviously I disagree, but as you've defined god, I can understand the attraction. I think it's a pretty standard definition of God for all put those of the extremes (your EZs). \n \n Irregardless of the omniscience and omnipotence, and the \"power\" associated with him in your definition, god would make a good parent, sibling or wife.\n \n \nI do not base my belief in him on something such as the origins of the universe. My belilef is based on the fact that I have tried out what is said to be true about him and found it perfectly sound. I have never been let down by Him and while I cannot always see what He is doing, I am sure that He is involved and has my back.\n \n That is what I believe.\n\n \n My question then is simple - if that is the case, when why attempt to justify his existence using science, or more specifically logic? Why is faith in god as you've defined him not enough to satisfy you?\n \n Waxy",

Just because there is evidence to the contrary does not mean that my evidence does not exist.\n \n Please pay attention to the argument.\n\n \n I agree with you EF, I think trebor has strayed off the track.\n \n It does not mean your evidence does not exist, it does mean that your evidence may not be reliable, or that it may be of questionable value.\n \n I believe that is the point trebor is trying to make.\n \n To put it another way, you're trying to buy a $1 item with $.01.

   "Sorry EF, I was out of town.\n \n First off - I agree that everything (well almost everything), you've presented can be considered evidence. The question is, is it GOOD evidence? Is it observable, reliable, testable, repeatable, etc...?\n \n Documentary evidence and writings are your best evidence, and as I'm sure you know, they don't form the strongest basis. \n \n The fact that we create is in no way evidence of a creator. That's false logic.\n \n I'm not aware of any documented and scientifically verified cases of anyone being raised from the dead.\n \n \"Miracles\" most often have explanations, where we have no explanation, God can be inserted, but so can anything, including simply, \"I don't know\".\n \n Healing of the terminally ill through prayer is pretty much a dead end street. I think that's been proven in this thread.\n \n I don't doubt the \"power of prayer\" has some positive influence on those that are ill, however, the fact that the prayer is to the Christian God is irrelevent.\n Prayer means the presence of loved ones and a positive atmosphere, IMHO, that affects the mental state of the patient, and that in turn can help in overcoming illness. \n \n All of this \"evidence\" is indeterminate in nature, it could support the existance of God, but it could also support the existance of Thor or the boogeyman. \n \n Alternatively, it could simply be that we don't as yet know the answers, and it isn't evidence of anything.\n \n \n \n Interesting.\n \n I have no real objections to your definition, obviously I disagree, but as you've defined god, I can understand the attraction. I think it's a pretty standard definition of God for all put those of the extremes (your EZs). \n \n Irregardless of the omniscience and omnipotence, and the \"power\" associated with him in your definition, god would make a good parent, sibling or wife.\n \n \n \n My question then is simple - if that is the case, when why attempt to justify his existence using science, or more specifically logic? Why is faith in god as you've defined him not enough to satisfy you?\n \n Waxy\n\n \n As to the documentary evidence: I would say that my point is that it is as good of evidence as any other document considered historically reliable. For example, consider the new testament. The originals (which we do not have) were written in greek between roughtly 50 and 100 AD. While we do not have the originals there are 5000 manuscripts available with approximately 25000 copies available. Some dating back to as early as 120AD by scientific dating methods.\n \n In comparison for Plato's manuscripts there are only 7 copies in existence and the earliest manuscript is over 1300 years after the fact of the writing. Yet these are absolutely considered to be authored by plato and to be good copies of what he actually wrote.\n \n Norman Geisler makes several key observations for our consideration:\n \n No other book is even a close second to the Bible on either the number or early dating of the copies. The average secular work from antiquity survives on only a handful of manuscripts; the New Testament boasts thousands.\n \n The average gap between the original composition and the earliest copy is over 1,000 years for other books.\n \n The New Testament, however, has a fragment within one generation from its original composition, whole books within about 100 years from the time of the autograph [original manuscript], most of the New Testament in less than 200 years, and the entire New Testament within 250 years from the date of its completion.\n \n The degree of accuracy of the copies is greater for the New Testament than for other books that can be compared. Most books do not survive with enough manuscripts that make comparison possible.\n \n As to the argument I raised concerning prayer and miracles, I will concede that portion. NOt that I think your correct, simply that I cannot prove it and the evidence for it has alternate explanations. It was a poorly constructed argument on my part with little actual research done. I will do more and if I find something better then I will post.\n \n As to your last question: \"My question then is simple - if that is the case, when why attempt to justify his existence using science, or more specifically logic? Why is faith in god as you've defined him not enough to satisfy you?\"\n \n It is plenty to satisfy me. However, it is not enough to satisfy you and others. My hope is to make you question and think. I also hope to learn more about my own faith and beliefs as you question me. It is good for me. I share it with others BECAUSE it has been good for me.
