   "For the fact that US supports Israel for their existence in that area, it could be said that Israel is the front gate of US against all terrorists who supposely attack US, instead they attack Israel. Who do you think Iran would attack if Israel wasn't there? the answer is so clear \"US\". And why do they pick this time to create a dispute with Israel? it 's because US who is the main supporter for Israel is incompetence with all the issue in Iraq and defense themselve, they won't be able to help anyone anymore. That's why many countries who stand against US are starting to realize that fact and react the way they did. For example, North Korea. But then, this might be good for US if Israel create a massive conflict between them and Arab nation because then they will make themselve to be more attractive target to the terrorists than US. I think the point where US will stand in this situation is to do nothing and enjoy the show.",
