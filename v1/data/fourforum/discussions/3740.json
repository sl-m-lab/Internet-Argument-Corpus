   "Hello all! , and how'are you doing? , yet can any see about the issue of: \"What is Regilion\"? (Since our Lord was the only one who had demostrated what Religion should be based upon: John 14:6) and more, <P<\n \n http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=%22what+is+religion%3F%22 emoticon_idea <P<\n \n but on this link below:.....Please! scroll down on this page to the Word Religion @ # 8.\n \n http://firstthing1sttab2002.freeservers.com/custom2.html :) \n \n \"Pure Religion\": James 1:1-8-12-21-\"23-26, but esp. verse 27-\"Pure Religion and undefiled before God and the is this\", to visit the fatherless and to keep himself/oneself unspotted from the world. ........holy, orphans, trouble. \n \n Now! I would say, of course, after taking heed of the replies, what is the meaning of the question that is asked about, \"what is Religion\"? , well there are a few more definitions from different authors, for an example: \n \n 1. Religion...A system of Faith.\n \n 2. A person belief in something, or ones aspect of life.\n \n 3. A Spiritual or Natural kind of belief.\n \n 4. Different kinds of dictionary or encyclopedia intrepretations on \"what is Religion\"?\n \n 5. Something to worship.\n \n 6. Living a God Fearing/Santified life. \n \n Philippians 2:1-5-11-12-Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have also obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much in my absence, \"work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, Eph. 6:5.\n \n but the issues are somewhat different as to the different walks of life towards righteousness and holiness, Hebrews 12:14, \n \n inwhich, righteousness and true holiness should be the way of life, which has been proven, because of history repeating itself, because of its issues. \n \n So then! since I've deceided! to have me a persional Saviour to help me! , realizing of course, that I had to: \n \n \n \n 1. Repent: Turn from my wicked ways.\n \n 2. Start Believing in the truth of The Holy Bibles but for myself, because of righteousness and holiness.\n \n 3. Also that I had to not only hear!, but do! whatever that was and still is! , that which is well-pleasing in the sight of My Saviour to do, rather than believing in/or living in a lie, so that I would not have a strong delusion, or a reprobate mind, \n \n which I! wanted to know the Truth so that I can live right, but what do these issues has to do with Religion, as one might ask? \n \n Definition: \n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=3323\n \n http://www.icq.com/boards/view_messages.php?tid=295&topic_id=590943",

How can anyone dicuss the meaning or definition of religion when all you have done is give a personal account of how you became a christian. While that may have been just smashing of an experience for you, it is not a debate or point to discuss on \"what is religion\"\n \n It appears to me that religion for you is belief in christ. That may ot be religion for someone else. Nor does it take into account there are thousands of relgions in existience. Would you like to try again?",

   "Let me help you out by giving a starting point on what is religion. \n \n The is the literal defintion and the spiritual definition and then I can't leave out the social defintion of what religion is....\n \n I myself will answer the social defintion and let others approach the alternative defintions.\n \n As a social defintion I see religion as a way of explaining that in life which you cannot explain, giving you a sense of comfort that you do not need to explain it, but prove it. Example being creationism: Creationist are not trying to explore how the world got here, they are out to prove the story of creation in the bible. (not a hypothesis as general science would do).\n \n Religion as a social defintion also gives people a sense of right and wrong which gives their psyche a sense of calm for their actions. By saying they will be saved or forgiven, they feel comfort and calm, much like a drug or addiction would create dopimine and calm the limbic system.\n \n Now maybe someone else can either rip my thoughts apart or introduce some other definitions of \"Religion\", maybe address the literal or spiritual definitions.",
