Not being able to even take an aspirin for a headache during a time when migraines are MORE frequent. Bloating. Constipation. Peeing constantly. Having the little bugger sitting on your bladder and stomach - adding to the need to pee and making it hard to eat much in the later months even though you are hungry all the time. Food tastes different. Your are ten zillion degrees hotter than anyone else. You wobble. Difficulty putting on shoes. Hormonal emotional havoc. (That did not end until a full year after he was born). Impossible to find a comfortable sleeping position. Extreme exhaustion. A whole new wardrobe (and it's not like maternity clothes are cheap). Back pain. Boob pain. Labor (it hurts bunches). Delivery (try passing a bowling ball). Post partem depression. And then any permanent damage done by the pregancy (permanant bladder damage here - have even had to have surgery). \n \n And my preganancy was healthy and went relatively well. Can't imagine if there are complications or if you are high risk....",

   "Based on threads I 've been reading here, there is a real tendency among some of the pro-choicers to portray pregnancy as a horrible thing that cause women to suffer--that it is somthing bad or undesirable.\n \n Rather than bring into this peripheral thoughts to the question, such as rights and legal issues (which are discussed at length here already in other threads), I'd love to hear straightforward relelvant answers to this. I am also already aware that pregnancy can sometimes involve complications or that it can at times cause financial constraints. But I am mainly interested in seeing why there is a default tendency in pro-choice arguments to argue from the standpoint of pregnancy being a bad thing. Any thoughts?\n\n \n No, fundamental misunderstanding on your part.\n \n It's not your right to decide, (even worse since your a guy), nor my rigt to decide, whether or not pregnancy (which you can't right now experience, now can you?) is good, bad, fun, not fun, suffering, not suffering, desireable, or not desirable, horrible, or joyful, happy, or sad for a pregnant woman.\n \n Even with your question you imply you're right, and others are wrong. Who's wrong? Susan might love the idea of being pregnant. Betty might fear it more than anything. Christine might be scared, but want's the option of stopping it early so when she DOES have a child, she's prepared. Tina was raped and will NOT suffer through the pregnancy, either she'll legally get an abortion, or she'll drink herself into a stupor with vodka over and over to mis-carry, putting her life at risk.\n \n NO\n \n It's not for YOU to decide. Woman have the RIGHT to choose, your little personal whim about it is not sufficent to remove their right, get use to it. This is what america is about, freedoms, not government, or jyoshu-controlled morality. You could absolutely HATE, or absolutely LOVE the notion of being pregnant.

10% of pregnancies) \n -- eclampsia (convulsions, coma during pregnancy or labor, high risk of death) \n -- gestational diabetes \n -- placenta previa \n -- anemia (which can be life-threatening) \n -- thrombocytopenic purpura \n -- severe cramping \n -- embolism (blood clots) \n -- medical disability requiring full bed rest (frequently ordered during part of many pregnancies varying from days to months for health of either mother or baby) \n -- diastasis recti, also torn abdominal muscles \n -- mitral valve stenosis (most common cardiac complication) \n -- serious infection and disease (e.g. increased risk of tuberculosis) \n -- hormonal imbalance \n -- ectopic pregnancy (risk of death) \n -- broken bones (ribcage, \"tail bone\") \n -- hemorrhage and \n -- numerous other complications of delivery \n -- refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease \n -- aggravation of pre-pregnancy diseases and conditions (e.g. epilepsy is present in .5% of pregnant women, and the pregnancy alters drug metabolism and treatment prospects all the while it increases the number and frequency of seizures) \n -- severe post-partum depression and psychosis \n -- research now indicates a possible link between ovarian cancer and female fertility treatments, including \"egg harvesting\" from infertile women and donors \n -- research also now indicates correlations between lower breast cancer survival rates and proximity in time to onset of cancer of last pregnancy \n -- research also indicates a correlation between having six or more pregnancies and a risk of coronary and cardiovascular disease \n \n These are some less common (but serious) complications: \n \n -- peripartum cardiomyopathy \n -- cardiopulmonary arrest \n -- magnesium toxicity \n -- severe hypoxemia/acidosis \n -- massive embolism \n -- increased intracranial pressure, brainstem infarction \n -- molar pregnancy, gestational trophoblastic disease (like a pregnancy-induced cancer) \n -- malignant arrhythmia \n -- circulatory collapse \n -- placental abruption \n -- obstetric fistula \n \n And a few more permanent side effects: \n \n \n -- future infertility \n -- permanent disability \n -- death.\n \n And I'm sure I've missed some.\n \n \n \n Why the cheap shot against pp?\n\n \n So, tell me, if it is ALWAYS life-threatening, why are there so few life-threatening conditions mentioned above? I agree that pregnancy can tax a person's system, but so does exercise, the flu, and a million other things and only, rarely, do these result in death. In fact, I'm willing to bet that you're more likely to die from the flu than pregnancy. Want to take me up on the bet? :)\n \n Oh and my \"love\" of PP stems from my knowledge of its original goal and current practices.",

   "Based on threads I 've been reading here, there is a real tendency among some of the pro-choicers to portray pregnancy as a horrible thing that cause women to suffer--that it is somthing bad or undesirable.\n \n - How could the opportunity to bring a life into the world, a wonderful miracle, be so awful by default?\n \n Rather than bring into this peripheral thoughts to the question, such as rights and legal issues (which are discussed at length here already in other threads), I'd love to hear straightforward relelvant answers to this. I am also already aware that pregnancy can sometimes involve complications or that it can at times cause financial constraints. But I am mainly interested in seeing why there is a default tendency in pro-choice arguments to argue from the standpoint of pregnancy being a bad thing. Any thoughts?\n\n \n As others pointed out, this is a misconception. I have little doubt that the great majority of pro-choice people are quite positive about wanted pregnancies. I suspect that this misconseption comes from the fact that almost all abortion discussions are about pregnancies that are not wanted. Pregnancies that are wanted are almost never discussed since they are not relevant to an abortion debate.

   "Yes, much like most of things in life. How about \"is stressful and a detriment on the body\". Most things that are stressful on the body and a detriment on the body are not forced by law.\n\n \n \"Stressful\" is certainly a more accurate and realistic term. Ironically, compared to many everyday things, pregnancy is one of the least harmful, given the rate of successful pregnancies these days. I wouldn't use \"detriment\" though. \n \n \nWhether or not it is \"natural\" is meaningless, because there are plenty of natural things that are a detriment to the body.\n\n \n What I meant is that it is a natural process the body goes through, like hunger, elimination of waste, or menopause. These are normal, natural precesses that people go through. Pregnancy is one of them, it's just that a woman has much more control over starting that process than the others.\n \n \nThe changes put stress on the body, and are a detriment to the body (in the physical sense).\n \n The reality is that pregnancy is harming her body, is putting stress on her body, and is a detriment to her body.\n\n \n I disagree that a normal successful pregnancy is a detriment and/or harmful. What I do think is that you (and other pro-choicers) are doing your best to portray even a normal pregnancy the same way you would portray such activity as jumping into a shark pool (\"harmful\", \"detrimental\"). You know what I am saying is correct--either you're deliberately trying to portray pregnancy in an awful malevolent light, or you've actually embraced the worst elements of your movement to the point where you actually DO think of pregnancy along the lines of jumping into a shark pool or scaling a cliff with no safety lines. Either way, it's pretty sad. \n \n These terms you are using can't be used in such a discussion as this without qualifying them. To do otherwise reeks of intellectual dishonesty.\n \n \nYou do not believe a woman's perception of her pregnancy is important?\n\n \n Where did I say that? How did you make the leap from my statement \"The perception is not the same as reality\" to your ill-founded question \"You do not believe a woman's perception of her pregnancy is important?\" I am starting to wonder if you are reading the same thread that I am!! Of course I believe her perceptions are important. I never said they weren't!\n \n \nThe perception is paramount.\n\n \n To make perception paramount over the reality of the situation is to deny the reality that pregnancy is almost never harmful these days. I think influencing the perceptions of a woman to make her think her pregnancy is something she shouldn't have or something \"harmful\" is an attempt to manipulate her: the pro-choice movement at it's worst. It's one reason I believe that the pro-choice self-claim that it acts in the interests of the woman is BS. I've seen pro-choicers put their ideology over what many women want too many times to buy it.\n \n \nHer perception of the pregnancy is important because pregnancy is a huge change in her life. If she has a negative perception of the pregnancy, how do you think that will affect her life? \n\n \n Of course it's important, and no one is saying there should be a \"negative\" perception. In fact I would argue for the opposite--I think your movement does more to propogate pregnancy in a negative light.\n \n \nTo a woman who wants to be pregnant, the stress is worth it because in the end she will have the joy of a child. To a woman who wants no child and does not want to be pregnant, the stress will most likely not be worth it to her.\n\n \n At least you are now getting away from inaccurate terms like \"harmful\" and \"deteriment,\" especially for normal physically successful pregnancies.\n \n I agree that the stress of a pregnancy is welcomed by the woman who wants to be pregnant. (My wife exemplifies this. She's a trooper! Didn't even use an epidural, though I wanted her to. She wanted to experience pregnancy as natually as possible--that was her choice.) The other end of the spectrum is the woman who doesn't welcome the pregnancy, and though the stress may not be \"worth it to her\", in my opinion that's the wrong way to look at it in the first place. A pregnancy should always be thought of as at least accpetable. I agee that rape is the hardest case for this to happen, and I wouldn't judge any woman who would abort a baby after rape, though I still sure hate to see the baby terminated over it. I'd much rather her let it come to term and I'd adopt it myself if possible . . . abortion is always the worst option IMO.\n \n \nIf you do not see the difference and the oppression inherent in forcing the pregnancy on a woman who does not want it, I don't know what hope there is for you.\n\n \n \"What hope there is for me??\" Sorry, but I am not interested in your pro-choice evangelism to your political movement. Take your cult-like adherence to your dogma elsewhere and prostlytize someone else, if you are trying for me to 'have hope.' The root of the problem isn't that something would be forced; but rather that the woman isn't willing to allow the pregnancy to save the baby in the first place.",

What you said made me think that the woman's perception simply wasn't important to you.\n \n \n\n To make perception paramount over the reality of the situation is to deny the reality that pregnancy is almost never harmful these days.\n\n \n Unless you can take the fetus out of the woman, it will continue to live off of her body. It will continue to instigate hormonal changes and physical changes to her body. These changes put stress on her body, sometimes greater sometimes lesser, but there is always stress put on her body. Stress is harmful to the body.\n \n \n\n I think influencing the perceptions of a woman to make her think her pregnancy is something she shouldn't have or something \"harmful\" is an attempt to manipulate her: the pro-choice movement at it's worst. It's one reason I believe that the pro-choice self-claim that it acts in the interests of the woman is BS. I've seen pro-choicers put their ideology over what many women want too many times to buy it.\n\n \n Oh come off it. Whether or not the pro-choice movement was here there are unwanted pregnancies. Do you honestly think that a woman who does not want her pregnancy will have a good attitude about it? Perhaps sometimes, but for the most part I think she won't see it as something pleasant.\n \n \n\n Of course it's important, and no one is saying there should be a \"negative\" perception. In fact I would argue for the opposite--I think your movement does more to propogate pregnancy in a negative light.\n\n \n No, we just dispell the notion that pregnancy is all sunshine and sweetness.\n \n \n\n At least you are now getting away from inaccurate terms like \"harmful\" and \"deteriment,\" especially for normal physically successful pregnancies.\n\n \n Whatever dude. Successful or not, the stress is a detriment to the woman's body.\n \n \n\n I agree that the stress of a pregnancy is welcomed by the woman who wants to be pregnant. (My wife exemplifies this. She's a trooper! Didn't even use an epidural, though I wanted her to. She wanted to experience pregnancy as natually as possible--that was her choice.) The other end of the spectrum is the woman who doesn't welcome the pregnancy, and though the stress may not be \"worth it to her\", in my opinion that's the wrong way to look at it in the first place.\n\n \n How does your opinion of how she should view her pregnancy matter to her. I would like women to view their pregnancies positively, but I won't say she should. I do not know her life or what events caused her to view it this way. Pregnancy is a huge deal in a woman's life and a very personal thing, there is no single way a woman should view it. \n \n \n\n A pregnancy should always be thought of as at least accpetable.\n\n \n You do not determine what other's think. There is no way a person should think, because each person is different. This is one of the major failings of the pro-life movement, the notion that people should think a certain way about an area that is so personal.\n \n \n\"\n I agee that rape is the hardest case for this to happen, and I wouldn't judge any woman who would abort a baby after rape, though I still sure hate to see the baby terminated over it. I'd much rather her let it come to term and I'd adopt it myself if possible . . . abortion is always the worst option IMO.\n\n \n You shouldn't judge no matter her reason. When a woman has an abortion, it seems necessary to her, perhaps as necessary as she would see it after a rape. It doesn't matter how necessary you see it, because you aren't involved.\n \n \n\n \"What hope there is for me??\" Sorry, but I am not interested in your pro-choice evangelism to your political movement.\n\n \n It's also empathy and compassion for other people. I see little hope for you.\n \n \n\n Take your cult-like adherence to your dogma elsewhere and prostlytize someone else, if you are trying for me to 'have hope.' The root of the problem isn't that something would be forced; but rather that the woman isn't willing to allow the pregnancy to save the baby in the first place.\n\n \n The root of the problem is that she isn't willing, you are right. That will change for the majority if women recieved education on safe-sex, on the realities of pregnancy and childbirth, and also financial support if they get pregnant and the support they need to get away from their parents and/or boyfriend if they are abusive and/or are trying to force her to have an abortion. \n \n This isn't a reality though. Making abortion illegal will put women in untenetable positions as well as force them through a pregnancy they do not want, and that is oppressive.",

   "Ok, this makes sense. \n \n I do think however, that wanted pregnancies should be a part of the abortion debate, even though as you say, they usually are not. Part of the abortion issue (and the most important part, IMO) is the perception of pregnancy itself. If society moves in a direction where having a baby is looked upon as a negative thing, this is not good. One way to help make abortion rarer is to help people view having a baby as a positive thing. As Clinton himself once said, abortion should be rare.\n\n \n I would also like to see women choose and want to have their babies instead of terminating their pregnancies, as long as they are able to handle the responsibilities of having a baby or are able to handle the possibility of passing on those responsibilities to someone else - via adoption, having a relative bring it up, etc. Though I haven't experienced it myself, I can well imagine that having a child can be a wonderful experience. However, I believe that there are many instances where having a baby would pose very grave difficulties. Some of these might include:\n \n - The woman might not be able to financially afford to have another child. This may be a parent who already has too many mouths to feed and would reduce the health and life opportunities of the other children if she had more children. It may be a young single woman of poor job prospects who may have no recourse but to fall back on welfare, whereas, if she waited to have children until she would be older and more prepared, she could be a better mother to those future children.\n \n - The community in which the woman lives might be extremely negative about unmarried woman having children so both she and the baby would suffer that stigma, whereas, if she secretly got an abortion, she could maintain her reputation and have children in marriage later on in a much better social environment.\n \n - Of course, there are the cases of rape, incest and a threat to the life of the mother, but I think we mostly agree on those.\n \n I think that women are generally able to decide for themselves when it would be too hard for them to have a baby, so I believe that women should have the right to choose (at least during the first and second trimester) - especially since it is her body that is so intimitely involved in the process. \n \n Yes, theoretically, they could put the child up for adoption, but giving a child up for adoption poses many difficulties for the woman, including the stigma and guilt associated with giving up a child. I applaud those women who are able to handle that stigma and give another couple the opportunity to adopt her baby, but I would not dream of forcing her into that decision. Unfortunately, though a lot of progress has been made in recent decades, there is still some social stigma left against those who give up children for adoption and against those who choose single motherhood (marriage is not always a possibility) . Reduce that stigma and you might reduce the number of abortions.",

   "Stress is a detriment to the body. That most are successful does not negate that. Some are more, some are less, but all are stressful on the body. There are major changes that happen to the body, hormonal and physical.\n\n \n But its not detrimental, in most cases.\n \n \nPregnancy is a major process the body goes through. None of those, with the possible exception of menopause, even come close to comparing to it. Menopause is also hard on a woman's body, especially emotionally.\n\n \n But it's still a natural process. You remind me of the way George W. Bush debates: someone makes a point, and you immediately jump to a red herring. I made a point that it was natural, and you jumped to an unrelated point that it was a \"major\" process, as if no one already knew that. Of course it's a major process--everyone would agree with that!\n \n \nWhether or not it is natural means nothing! Natural processes can also be a big detriment to the body.\n\n \n Sure it does!

Again, you are using language that would describe something along the lines of standing in front of an on-cming train to describe a normal pregnancy. I'm flabergasted that you do not realize this.\n \n \nThen you are a fool. Whatever nice and wonderful thing bringing a child into the world is, pregnancy is damn hard on the body.\n\n \n That's a strawman; I never claimed it wasn't hard on the body. I said it was not detrimental and not harmful in most cases. That's the truth, as most women are completely back to normal within weeks of their baby's delivery.\n \n \nNo, jumping in to a shark pool is \"stupid\" and \"dangerous\". Neither of which I would use to describe pregnancy. \n\n \n It's also harmful and detrimental, which IS the way you describe pregnancy.\n \n \nI do not need to qualify them because they are always true. Every pregnancy is stressful to the woman's body and all are a detriment to the body in the physical sense.. How severe does change, but it is always true.\n\n \n I'm noticing a pattern in your debating: you switch your wording back and forth between 'detriment', 'harmful,' and then 'stressful,' depending on which is advantageous at the time.

At least your overall posts indicate you don't. Because you put far more effort into 'dispeling the sweetness of pregnancy' and seeing that women can kill the baby than you do indicating pregnancy is a beautiful thing. Let me put it this way: if I were at a baby shower and you were there, I'd brace myself for the excited mother feel like her baby wasn't a big deal or maybe even a detriment once you got done with her. She'd probably be saddened or angry afterwards. I know you don't like to hear that, but that's the real-world effect of your comments.\n \n \nYou shouldn't judge no matter her reason. When a woman has an abortion, it seems necessary to her, perhaps as necessary as she would see it after a rape. It doesn't matter how necessary you see it, because you aren't involved.\n\n \n So you've never judged a person who killed another before? Sorry, but I'll judge all I want, thank you. Stop killing unborn babies and people will stop judging you. As long as a woman's actions affect another (the baby, in this case), her actions are grounds to be judged. It would be different if it truly were personal, but it's not as the woman is not the only one affected by her action.\n \n \nIt's also empathy and compassion for other people.\n\n \n If manipulating women (as the pro-choice movement does) as a means to an end is your idea of compassion, I'd sure hate to see your idea of malevolence.\n \n \nThe root of the problem is that she isn't willing, you are right.

Of course I would not go and say \"Well, I know your excited but I want to tell you that 3 months from now it might kill you.

Anything that has inherent health issues shouldn't be forced by law.\n \n \n\n - If we consider 'health issues' to lean more toward life threatening issues, then in fact health issues do NOT always take place when one is pregnant.\n\n \n Ok, but that's not what we were talking about.

If one does not one's health to be damaged, it is a health issue. There is already a distinction for pro-lifers. You want it only allowable in cases of 'life' -- that is, only if the woman's life is at risk. Pro-choicers want it in cases of 'health' -- that is, if the woman's health is at risk. Since a woman's health is constantly at risk during a pregnancy (that is, her health is damaged), abortion is allowable during all pregnancies.\n \n For you to say that 'health' should mean 'life' is just you trying to shut down choices.

Why do you think that is? Could it be because of what she goes through to have one?

Perhaps some, but certainly those reasons would virtually vanish. I cannot 'know' this, but I believe it is a safe bet.\n \n Not wanting parental responsiblities? One can do that with adoption. I think it is logical to assume that the reason women do not do that is because they do not want to go through a pregnancy to get to that point.\n \n Regarding financial difficulties, I agree with you that those have little to do with health issues.

The man was not a Nazi or Klansman; he was Dr. S. Adolphus Knopf, a member of Margaret Sanger's American Birth Control League (ABCL), which along with other groups eventually became known as Planned Parenthood.\n \n Sanger's other colleagues included avowed and sophisticated racists. One, Lothrop Stoddard, was a Harvard graduate and the author of The Rising Tide of Color against White Supremacy. Stoddard was something of a Nazi enthusiast who described the eugenic practices of the Third Reich as \"scientific\" and \"humanitarian.\" And Dr. Harry Laughlin, another Sanger associate and board member for her group, spoke of purifying America's human \"breeding stock\" and purging America's \"bad strains.\" These \"strains\" included the \"shiftless, ignorant, and worthless class of antisocial whites of the South.\"\n \n Not to be outdone by her followers, Margaret Sanger spoke of sterilizing those she designated as \"unfit,\" a plan she said would be the \"salvation of American civilization.: And she also spike of those who were \"irresponsible and reckless,\" among whom she included those \" whose religious scruples prevent their exercising control over their numbers.\" She further contended that \"there is no doubt in the minds of all thinking people that the procreation of this group should be stopped.\" That many Americans of African origin constituted a segment of Sanger considered \"unfit\" cannot be easily refuted.\n http://blackgenocide.org/sanger.html \n",

The main objects of the Population Congress would be:\n \n a. to raise the level and increase the general intelligence of population.\n \n b. to increase the population slowly by keeping the birth rate at its present level of fifteen per thousand, decreasing the death rate below its present mark of 11 per thousand.\n \n c. to keep the doors of immigration closed to the entrance of certain aliens whose condition is known to be detrimental to the stamina of the race, such as feebleminded, XXXXXX, XXXXXX, insane, syphilitic, epileptic, criminal, professional prostitutes, and others in this class barred by the immigration laws of 1924.\n \n d. to apply a stern and rigid policy of sterilization and segregation to that grade of population whose progeny is tainted, or whose inheritance is such that objectionable traits may be transmitted to offspring.\n \n e. to insure the country against future burdens of maintenance for numerous offspring as may be born of feebleminded parents, by pensioning all persons with transmissible disease who voluntarily consent to sterilization.\n \n f. to give certain dysgenic groups in our population their choice of segregation or sterilization.\n \n g. to apportion farm lands and homesteads for these segregated persons where they would be taught to work under competent instructors for the period of their entire lives.\n \n The first step would thus be to control the intake and output of XXXXXX, mental defectives, epileptics.\n \n The second step would be to take an inventory of the secondary group such as illiterates, paupers, unemployables, criminals, prostitutes, dope-fiends; classify them in special departments under government medical protection, and segregate them on farms and open spaces as long as necessary for the strengthening and development of moral conduct.\n \n Having corralled this enormous part of our population and placed it on a basis of health instead of punishment, it is safe to say that fifteen or twenty millions of our population would then be organized into soldiers of defense---defending the unborn against their own disabilities.\n \n The third step would be to give special attention to the mothers' health, to see that women who are suffering from tuberculosis, heart or kidney disease, toxic goitre, gonorrhea, or any disease where the condition of pregnancy disturbs their health are placed under public health nurses to instruct them in practical, scientific methods of contraception in order to safeguard their lives---thus reducing maternal mortality.\n \n The above steps may seem to place emphasis on a health program instead of on tariffs, moratoriums and debts, but I believe that national health is the first essential factor in any program for universal peace.\n \n With the future citizen safeguarded from hereditary taints, with five million mental and moral degenerates segregated, with ten million women and ten million children receiving adequate care, we could then turn our attention to the basic needs for international peace.\n \n There would then be a definite effort to make population increase slowly and at a specified rate, in order to accommodate and adjust increasing numbers to the best social and economic system.\n \n In the meantime we should organize and join an International League of Low Birth Rate Nations to secure and maintain World Peace.\n \n Summary of address before the New History Society, January 17th, New York City \n \n\n \n\n The Planned Parenthood connection - Who is Lothrop Stoddard?\n \n Margaret Sanger appointed Lothrop Stoddard as a board member of the Birth Control League (the forerunner of Planned Parenthood). What did Stoddard think about Nazi eugenics? Author Stefan Kuhl writes (5):\n \n When the Nazis came to power, argued Stoddard, they started to increase \"both the size and the quality of the population.\" They coupled initiatives designed to encourage \"sound\" citizens to reproduce with a \"drastic curb of the defective elements.\" (7) Stoddard personally witnessed how the Nazis were \"weeding out the worst strains in the Germanic stock in a scientific and truly humanitarian way.\"\n \n Lothrop Stoddard and the \"Jews Problem\"\n \n It is no secret that Adolf Hitler and the Nazis favored Jews be more subject to induced abortion and sterilization than other groups. Stefan Kuhl writes (pp. 61-62):\n \n He [Lothrop Stoddard] even met personally with Adolf Hitler. William L. Shirer, an American colleague who had been in Germany since 1934, complained that the Reich minister for propaganda [Joseph Goebbels] gave special preference to Stoddard because his writings on racial subject were \"featured in Nazi school textbooks.\"(8)\n \n Kuhl continues:\n \n Stoddard claimed in 1940 that the \"Jew problem\" is \"already settled in principle and soon to be settled in fact by the physical elimination of the Jews themselves from the Third Reich.\" \n \n Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood, made Lothrop Stoddard a board member of the forerunner to PP (the Birth Control League). Why was the Birth Control League reconstituted as Planned Parenthood? The 'Nazi smell' of BCL was so bad, that some 'cosmetics' were required.\n http://www.spectacle.org/997/richmond.html \n\n \n or how about \n\n The Pivot of Civilization\n by Margaret Sanger\n \n CHAPTER IV: The Fertility of the Feeble-Minded\n \n What vesture have you woven for my year? O Man and Woman who have fashioned it Together, is it fine and clean and strong, Made in such reverence of holy joy, Of such unsullied substance, that your hearts Leap with glad awe to see it clothing me, The glory of whose nakedness you know?\n \n The Song of the Unborn\n Amelia Josephine Burr \n \n There is but one practical and feasible program in handling the great problem of the feeble-minded. That is, as the best authorities are agreed, to prevent the birth of those who would transmit imbecility to their descendants. Feeble-mindedness as investigations and statistics from every country indicate, is invariably associated with an abnormally high rate of fertility. Modern conditions of civilization, as we are continually being reminded, furnish the most favorable breeding-ground for the mental defective, the XXXXX, the imbecile. ``We protect the members of a weak strain,'' says Davenport, ``up to the period of reproduction, and then let them free upon the community, and encourage them to leave a large progeny of `feeble-minded': which in turn, protected from mortality and carefully nurtured up to the reproductive period, are again set free to reproduce, and so the stupid work goes on of preserving and increasing our socially unfit strains.''\n \n The philosophy of Birth Control points out that as long as civilized communities encourage unrestrained fecundity in the ``normal'' members of the population--always of course under the cloak of decency and morality--and penalize every attempt to introduce the principle of discrimination and responsibility in parenthood, they will be faced with the ever-increasing problem of feeble-mindedness, that fertile parent of degeneracy, crime, and pauperism. Small as the percentage of the imbecile and half-witted may seem in comparison with the normal members of the community, it should always be remembered that feeble- mindedness is not an unrelated expression of modern civilization. Its roots strike deep into the social fabric. Modern studies indicate that insanity, epilepsy, criminality, prostitution, pauperism, and mental defect, are all organically bound up together and that the least intelligent and the thoroughly degenerate classes in every community are the most prolific. Feeble-mindedness in one generation becomes pauperism or insanity in the next. There is every indication that feeble-mindedness in its protean forms is on the increase, that it has leaped the barriers, and that there is truly, as some of the scientific eugenists have pointed out, a feeble-minded peril to future generations--unless the feeble-minded are prevented from reproducing their kind. To meet this emergency is the immediate and peremptory duty of every State and of all communities. \n\n \n Maybe you believe now that you've read her own words? Planned Parenthood has been attempting to distance themselves from their founders for many year. Now you know why. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n \n\n You also have said nothing aganist my paragraph where I sugest that the pro-life movement does far more to distroy the lower class than Margret Sanger could have ever fathomed or feared. I guess that's 'cuz you know I'm right.\n\n I didn't respond because I thought the assertion was a joke.",

Tell me, please, of your wonderful ancestors.\n\n \n No problem. Oldest father's side ancestor came over from Scotland as an indentured servant in the mid-1700's. From there, the family became farmers in NJ, never owning any slaves, participated in the Revolutionary War (in fact my family Bible is in a museum because an ancestor participated in the Greenwich Tea Burning) and fought for the North in the Civil War. Although my father died when I was 13, I can honestly say that I never heard him make a racist statement. He fought in WWII aboard an LSMR in the South Pacific during the last part of WWII, since that's where the majority of naval action took place, and was there on VJ Day. My father's family grew up Protestant, but weren't particularly religious. When my father married my mother, he had to agree to raise their kids as Catholics and did so.\n On my mother's side, my grandfather came to the US as a young teenager from a poor Italian family in the early 1900's. He experienced the typical prejudices against Italian immigrants, rose above it and became a very successful businessman in the Pocono Mountains in PA. The area was a big coal mining area up until WWII and was predominantly populated with Poles and Italians. Blacks were rare in that area, still are to a lesser extent, so there really wasn't any anti-black sentiment that I was aware of. The whole time that I interacted with him was after he was semi-retired and he never had an unkind word to say about anyone. When he died at age 97, they had to extend his viewing to three days to handle the visitors paying respects in a town with <3000 inhabitants. As practicing Roman Catholics, they were anti-abortion and even anti-birth control in general. Needless-to-say, I have a lot of relatives. :) \n I apologize if the above sounds boastful; it probably is. I'm very proud of my heritage and relatives. The purpose that I wrote the above wasn't to brag, but rather to show how foolish you were in your assumptions. emoticon_rolleyes",
