   "From post 62in the recent \"numbers\" thread, obvious_child called me a liar. \n \n This is a step by step example of how it all came about, and it shows how long and drawn out the details in these kinds of things can be. I believe those who do what obvious_child did hope that most peoples' attention span is too short to notice it. There may be many who will not have the patience to read through this. It will be interesting to see how many read this and determine if I am right or wrong. Comments? \n \n The Numbers thread was started by obvious child on 1-30-08, taking exception to my claim in a recent earlier thread that multiple posters opposing only one poster of another view can be questionably unfair. My first paragraph of post #4 - my first response read like this;\n \n \nWhen a number of posters on a forum such as this answer questions for each other, (answer questions not directed at them) it shows a lack of confidence in the person at whom the question was directed. That can often relieve the original questionee of the responsibility of answering the question. When there is a gang of posters against only one, no one member of the gang has much, if any, obligation to the debate. \n\n \n I also made this more clear in post #7.\n \n Obvious_childs response in post #14 read like this;\n \n \"How does that show lack of confidence?\" He also said in that post;\n \n \n Originally posted by obvious_child ] How does that prove that the majority are wrong?\n If I ask Electro what 2 + 2 is and if TQ answers, does that anyone wrong on the basis of who outnumbers who? \n\n \n That was all he said about that topic in post #14. \n \n My post #18 responded to his \"how does that show lack of confidence\" question like this;\n \n \n Originally posted by marc9000 ] By being afraid that the original person won't answer it as well, or forcefully enough to maybe drive the one poster away, so he can be taunted. You do it all the time. \n\n \n And in the same post, I answered the \"If I ask Electro...\" question like this;\n \n \n Originally posted by marc9000 ] No, but these debates aren't about anything that simple, and you know it. Worldview differences aren't as simple as 2+2. \n\n \n Some other irrelevant things went on up to post #35. He answered my \"by being afraid\" answer like this;\n \n \n Originally posted by obvious_child ] How are we afraid that the other person won't answer it? In many instances we know that the person won't answer for various reasons. Many people just post what everyone already knows. You don't have any examples of this where this is actually occurring. The archangel examples are all of us asking him to defend his positions and address ours. You won't find any of his where he actually defends his position and addresses points against him. \n\n \n I then quoted the first sentence of this paragraph only;\n \n \"How are we afraid that the other person won't answer it?\" \n \n \n And my response was;\n \n \n Originally posted by marc9000 ] You show it by answering in his place. \n\n \n SO THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION THAT WE WERE DISCUSSING HOW EVOLUTIONISTS ANSWER QUESTIONS FOR EACH OTHER. ARE WE CLEAR ON THAT - CAN EVERYBODY SEE THAT CLEARLY?\n \n My paragraph then continues;\n \n \n Originally posted by marc9000 ] If it were a 2+2=4 question, as you falsely imply that these type of debates are, you would let him answer it, since the question was directed at him, and since it only has one answer. By answering for him, you are showing that your answer may be more complete, or forceful than his answer would be. This shows that it is not as simple as 2+2=4. Then, the person who was originally asked the question won't answer it in a direct, basic way, he will expound on YOUR answer from different angle, or a more complex angle, often demanding more proof or sidetracking the issue. As the debate goes on, the burden put on the single poster constantly multiplies. \n\n \n His response to my point \"they show it by answering in his place\" was;\n \n \n Orignially posted by obvious_child ] And if they never answer? We all know that creationists are fundamentally some of the weakest debaters out there. It took 20 pages before an creationist tried to argue that my arguments against the flood were not valid. \n\n \n \n His implication was clearly that one evolutionist has a right to answer for another since there is always a chance that the original EVOLUTIONIST will never answer, since creationists are such lousy debaters. My response was;\n \n \n Originally posted by marc9000 ] They always answer, show me where they don't. \n\n \n Then he put up links showing where CREATIONISTS didn't answer his questions!! \n \n My response in post #50 went like this;\n \n \n Originally posted by marc9000 ] This is UNBELIEVABLE. We're now going to do an experiment, we're going to find out the extent of just how much two gang members really stick up for each other. \n \n ELECTROLYTE, this question is for you. Read it carefully and make sure you understand it. The topic was how multiple evolutionists will answer the same question posed by a creationist. The reason given was that maybe the original evolutionist won't answer the question right away or at all, so another evolutionist is justified in answering the question. My claim is that the original evolutionist always answers the question, that there's no need for someone else to answer for him. My accusation was that uncertainty in the original questionee is shown by others by answering for him. Obvious_childs question was, \"how does it show uncertainty\"? My response was, \"you show it (uncertainty) by answering for him\". His question was, \"and if they never answer?\" And my response was above, \"they always answer, show me where they don't\". AND HE POSTS THREADS WHERE CREATIONISTS DON'T RESPOND TO HIS TOPICS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n \n I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT CREATIONISTS ANSWERING, I'M TALKING ABOUT EVOLUTIONISTS GIVING MULTIPLE ANSWERS!\n \n He's LYING, he's deliberately trying to frustrate and confuse, exactly the way multiple posters try to frustrate ONE creationist poster! \n\n \n It was quite a revelation, and I wanted to see how someone else who generally \"sides\" , or \"gangs up\" with this poster would dance when pressed to give their opinions about this exchange. It was quite a dance as anyone can see. (\"I digress, wait no, I don't digress\", etc) \n \n In the following post, obvious_child lied again, by saying this;\n \n \n \n Originally posted by obvious_child ] To my quote of which asked \"And if they never answer?\" which was obviously in the context of creationists. \n \n I then gave you four examples of where creationists never argue.\n \n Seriously. You're caught red handed. \n\n \n It was obviously in context of evolutionists, and obvious_child knew that. And then he accused ME of being caught red handed! How amazing is this? \n \n Now that we have the \"liars corner\" forum, will obvious_child admit his lie? Will others who generally agree with him come here, do a dance and call me wrong in this case? Or will they come here and show some objectivity by admitting what I've shown?",

You invalidate your own claim.\n \n \n \nWhich is all that is needed to prove your claim that OC is unable/unwilling to debate one on one false.\n\n \n Your going to need a whole lot more then that to prove my claim. Where is the history of him making challenges in general, towards anyone who will take him on? Show me that, and then you would have proven my claim.\n \n \n \nHow is it \"shaky\"? You needle OC about being unable/unwilling to debate one on one and needing a \"gang\" to support/cover for him. I provided two examples were he issued open challenges for a one on one debate. Your claim has been falsified.\n\n \n If you have already read the statement above, then I don't need to explain again why I say it is shaky.\n \n \n \nAnd why does it have to be between OC and someone besides Marc? Why do your comments invalidate the evidence presented? Why does Marc's participation invalidate the evidence presented?\n\n \n Why can't it be between OC and someone besides Mark?! You're telling me that out of all the debaters that come on here to debate, the only person OC can debate against is Mark?! That's bad. A good debater can debate anyone.\n \n My comments invalidate evidence presented?! Hmmm....Pretty words, now explain to me in full detail why you feel as though my comments invalidate evidence presented. Back up your claims with evidence.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnd the \"justice\" present in reviving threads more than a month dead is... ?\n\n \n How is reviving a thread more than a month dead injustice?! This is a debate thread, and any topic here is liable to be brought up again, no matter how old it is. Stop whining like a child, about revived threads. That is so far beyond irrelevant, that it crosses from being sad, to rather gut splitting funny.\n \n Injustice is constantly attacking the same member of a debate forum. Constantly following him around, and challenging him to debates, that never are fair. Because you demand him to state his case, don't even listen to it, and dismiss him as a nuisance. Then just leave him alone if you feel that way about it. But no, he is constantly attacked by the same people. That = injustice. And is called cyber-bullying.emoticon_xgood \n \n \n \n \nBecause I don't agree with reviving threads that are more than a month old for the simple purpose of attacking another participant.\n\n \n Redundant.\n \n \nI revived a thread that was more than a month dead and buried for the simple purpose of attacking a poster in defense of a poster I have a prior history of siding with despite overwhelming evidence that he is incorrect?\n\n \n REDUNDANT.\n \n \n \nNo, as in this case the \"pot\" isn't reviving multiple/month old threads for the purpose of attacking a poster who had a disagreement with a seperate poster that the \"kettle\" has previosly shown allegiance to.\n\n \n REDUNDANT! REDUNDANT! REDUNDANT!!!!! \n \n \n \n \nSee the word \"primarily\" in my post there? That's what we call a \"qualifier\". So your assessment of my statement is faulty.\n\n \n Somewhere between your first sentence, and your last one you started babbling, and making little to no sense.

   "Like I said, two weak examples.\n\n You have yet to state why they were weak.\n \n \nI've never seen him try to debate anyone but Mark, in a cruel attempt to attack him, and vent personal problems on him.\n\n How is it a \"cruel attempt to attack him\" and \"vent personal problems on him\", when the debate challenges made were in direct response to previous posts of Marc's, and were an attempt to have him defend his position?\n \n \nAnd the other one was only after I said something.\n\n Wait, it's your claim that OC did not make the second thread in the debate challenge board until after you commented in the second thread he made in the debate challenge board?\n \n \nThis is not a regular for him to just challenge others without the help of his friends. I know, I've seen his posts. You invalidate your own claim.\n\n No, check again. I invalidated your claim. It's ok, I'll wait for you to catch up...\n \n \nYour going to need a whole lot more then that to prove my claim. \n\n You're right, I would. If I was trying to prove your claim. Unfortunately for you, you're the one stuck with that unenviable task.\n \n \nWhere is the history of him making challenges in general, towards anyone who will take him on? Show me that, and then you would have proven my claim.\n\n Again, I'm not going to try to prove your claim. Especially since I've already disproved it. To sum up:\n Spicy-\"OC won't debate ever unless he has a gang to support him! He'll never debate anyone one-on one!\"\n T.Q-\"well, he's made two challenges in the last few months in the one-on-one debate forum which have gone unanswered, so your claim that he would never debate without his gang is false.\"\n Spicy-\"That proves nothing! My claim that OC is a chicken still stands! And what you just said in no way supports my claim or proves that I'm correct!\"\n T.Q- emoticon_confused \n \n \nIf you have already read the statement above, then I don't need to explain again why I say it is shaky.\n\n I'm sorry, I didn't realize \"because I said so\" was a logical defense. My apologies.\n \n \nWhy can't it be between OC and someone besides Mark?!\n\n I don't know, maybe because Marc makes himself an easy target when he calls Roman Catholics, Buddhists, Shintoists, etc, etc, etc. atheists.\n \n \nYou're telling me that out of all the debaters that come on here to debate, the only person OC can debate against is Mark?!\n\n No, I'm telling you that out of all the debaters that come on her to debate, the only person OC has challenged is Marc. Probably because the topic seemed interesting to him.\n \n \nThat's bad. A good debater can debate anyone.\n\n So, why hasn't Marc answered any of the requests made by OC to debate him? Are you implying Marc is a bad debater? I think Marc could be a very skilled master debater.\n \n \nMy comments invalidate evidence presented?!\n\n Yeah, that was your claim.\n \n \nHmmm....Pretty words\n\n Thanks, I try.\n \n \nnow explain to me in full detail why you feel as though my comments invalidate evidence presented. Back up your claims with evidence.\n\n Why do you keep asking me to support your claims for you? This is the third time now.\n \n \nHow is reviving a thread more than a month dead injustice?!\n\n Oh, I didn't say it was injustice. You're the one claiming \"justice\" as a motive, to stand up for Marc being picked on by mean 'ole OC. Yet, here you are reviving a thread that's a month old for the sole purpose of needling and insulting OC. I wouldn't call that injustice, but I would call it hypocritical.\n \n \nThis is a debate thread,\n\n Actually, it's not. Check what subforum you're posting on.\n \n \nStop whining like a child, about revived threads. That is so far beyond irrelevant, that it crosses from being sad, to rather gut splitting funny.\n\n Oops, we're back to the name-calling and hostility again. I asked you this in another thread, I'll ask it here as well. Why do you feel the need to respond with names and hostility when someone asks you to clarify/support your position, or points out an error you've made?\n \n \nInjustice is constantly attacking the same member of a debate forum.\n\n I would agree. So why did you revive month old threads for the purpose of attacking OC?\n \n \nConstantly following him around, and challenging him to debates,\n\n Yeah, that's absolutely ridiculous on OC's part! What does he think this is, a debate board!?!\n \n \nthat never are fair.\n\n Why are they \"never fair\". Could you explain to me why OC's one on one challenges to Marc were \"unfair\" please?\n \n \nBecause you demand him to state his case, don't even listen to it, and dismiss him as a nuisance.\n\n Oh?\n \n \nThen just leave him alone if you feel that way about it. But no, he is constantly attacked by the same people. That = injustice. And is called cyber-bullying.emoticon_xgood\n\n Says the poster who has been following OC around, reviving dead threads he participated in, and insulting him.\n \n \nRedundant.\n \n \n \n REDUNDANT.\n \n \n \n \n REDUNDANT! REDUNDANT! REDUNDANT!!!!! \n\n And yet you were still unable to address the point that was made. \n \n \nSomewhere between your first sentence, and your last one you started babbling, and making little to no sense. It's quite hilarious really!emoticon_xgood \n\n Yeah, I think the reason it didn't make much sense to you is because you for some reason decided that I should take your position and start making your points for you.\n \n \nBy the way, you misspelled some words at the end. How can I take you seriously now?!emoticon_xhoho\n\n Heh. Well by your reasoning then, if a spelling error or two makes me laugh worthy, what does your post make you?",

   "Except all of us can hold our own. many of us even have offers for one on one. many of those go unanswered. \n\n \n You're confusing the word \"many\" with 'one or two'. \n \n \nEven still, are you actually agreeing with his insane idea that numbers actually prove who is right rather then the arguments themselves?\n\n \n \n It's not my insane idea, it's your insane straw man. I've never said nor implied that numbers prove who is right rather than arguments, I've said that lopsided numbers can alter arguments. I've shown how the question and answering process by a gang can distract from the original subject. I've shown that if one gang member abandons the debate for any reason, from lack of interest to a computer crash, the debate will go on without him being missed at all, yet if the lone poster abandons the debate for any reason, the debate stops except for multiple taunts of \"running away\" by most of the gang. \n \n An excellent example of what I'm talking about happened in the presidential debate a month or two ago. Hillary made some comment or implication about how Obama would be considered for a top position in her administration, possibly Vice President. Shortly after, in speaking to a group that was obviously being recorded for all to see, Obama questioned how the candidate in the number two position in the voting could offer the number one candidate a position in a future administration. I don't remember exactly how he worded it, but he said it in a somewhat sarcastic way. More than one political analyst said that it was a great line, but it was the wrong person who said it. It should have been said by one of Obama's staffers or campaigners, not by Obama himself, because it made him look too smug and arrogant. If a staffer had said it, it would have been put fourth just as effectively, yet without arrogance applied to Obama himself. If questioned about it, Obama simply could have shrugged and said he didn't say it, and it's regrettable that it was said, yet that does nothing to erase it from peoples minds. Debate includes logic and arguments, but it contains MORE than logic and arguments, it contains subjectivity and human imperfection. As this link (that I've referred to before) puts it; \n \n \nDebate is, fortunately or not, an exercise in persuasion, wit, and rhetoric, not just logic. \n\n \n and;\n \n \nBesides, let's be honest: debate is not just about finding truth, it's also about winning. If you think a fallacious argument can slide by and persuade the judge to vote for you, you're going to make it, right? The trick is not getting caught. \n\n \n You got caught twisting and distorting what I was saying about how evolutionists answer questions for each other, by cleverly trying to turn it around into a question of how creationists do or do not answer questions. It was complicated, not easy for me to put what you did into words to make it readable for others to understand what you did, and I'm not sure how well I did it, or if it was possible to do it considering natural human attention spans. If several others besides you were doing something similar to different parts of my argument at the same time, concisely sorting out what you all were doing would have been impossible. \n \n \n \n \n \nThen you believe that marc must be a poor debator as he doesn't stay on topic, uses the glish glop, relies on personal insults and ignores posts left and right.\n\n \n These are gang member accusations. Gangs can distract the topic, and a lone poster has to sort out what posts to answer, and what ones to ignore. If the lone poster ignores an off topic post by one gang member, then one or several gang members can accuse him of ignoring posts. A lone poster can't avoid being accused of not staying on topic, without subsequently being accused of ignoring posts. As (I believe it was Peeling) said, these free-for-all debates aren't really debates anyway, so it's not really important. It's true, but it's made important when the lone poster is taunted and accused as they often are on these forums.",

I could claim that you sexually violate chickens and refuse to support my assertion unless you challenge me to a formal debate on it; why would anybody believe me?\n\n \n \nSo you make your conclusion based on what you already know. But you haven't shown me any reason for believing these things about Dawkins and Hitchens. Why can't I call you a chicken violator because, well, I know that people who go by the name \"marc\" are chicken violators? Nobody believes me because I have no evidence, and neither do you.\n \n ...\n \n And if you're too busy having wonderful sexy fun with those chickens...\n You see, marc, you don't just get to make things up and pass them off as accurate. Can you show where the ACLU is arguing that religion should be equated with mental retardation? No? So you're just a liar?\n \n ...\n \n SHOW THE EVIDENCE, chickenlover. (This is, by the way, what I'll be calling you every time you tell another lie and fail to back it up.)\nPlease explain how these statements, taken in context, can possibly be understood as an accusation that you violate chickens. Every single instance you linked to includes a mention of you refusing to support your points.\n \n \nI thought the best way to show the context was to specify the post number, no better way to show actual context. [bold added]\n\n No, showing the actual context is the best way to show the actual context. ######n, how ridiculous can you be? I asked you to show the context, so show the context. If you'd like to link to the post as well, that's fine, but that doesn't show the context. Yeesh. It must take severe effort to be so obtuse. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nYet YOU brought up chickens and sex out of the clear blue, to needle me, to taunt me, to name call in a very juvenile fashion. So to sum up, the context was YOUR JUVENILITY.\n\n No, Holmes, I brought it up as a purposely ridiculous assertion to demonstrate that making claims with no evidence or argumentation is a vacuous way to debate. Unsurprisingly, you didn't get it, possibly because you know nothing else.\n \n \nYes. While you're at it, try to distinguish the difference between calling someone a name, and pointing out gaps in their explanations.\n\n I know the difference. You did both. I asked if you regarded him as a phony, and despite your squirming and attempting to evade, you accused him of not being a true Christian.\n \n \nBecause I never tell whoppers like the one you just told. There is no detail of his Christian beliefs in that book - NOWHERE NEAR A THIRD OF IT IS DEVOTED TO CHRISTIANITY.\n\n Well, I've loaned my copy to a friend, so I can't cite exact quotes or page numbers right now. What I can say is that marc is full of cr*p. In (I believe) Chapter 7, Miller has bolded three basic beliefs, one of which (if I remember correctly) is something like \"I believe that God has revealed himself to us.\"\n I also recall that out of nine chapters, the final three discuss his religious beliefs. For marc to say that \"there is no detail of his Christian beliefs\" is simply a lie.\n (This is especially humorous considering the vile with which marc insisted that mere titles and subheadings are more indicative of the text of a book than the text of the book.)",

How good the reasons were is a subjective matter - up to the reader. Insults and attempts at hijacking tells me there were many who didn't want others to read it.\n\n You're accusing others of derailing threads when this very comment has nothing to do with the remark of mine that elicited it?\n \n \nNo, you fibbed again! He made it clear on page 173, what creationists think, in his meeting with Henry Morris.\n\n No, I didn't fib at all. He said he expected a wink and a nod, meaning that he expected that Morris was a charlatan fraud.\n \n \nIn the same way that I could say that my impromptu posting with electrolyte and alllll his helpers teaches me an important lesson - the appeal of evolution is emotional, not scientific.\n\n emoticon_confused You think that rewording Miller's comment means anything? You can't even come up with an argument, so you change a word and pretend it applies?\n \n \n\"The real handiwork of God\" - THAT VICTOR STENGER DESCRIBES IN HIS BOOK?? Hahahaha - do you think about what you say before you say it?\n\n You accuse me of fibbing, but here you refer to Stenger's book when the conversation was about Miller's book. What hackery. emoticon_xdonno \n \n \nThe book does not address his Catholic beliefs. That you accuse other people of lying is truly amazing.\n\n No, I'm clearly justified. You have to pretend that we've completely switched which book we're talking about, then switch back so you can mount a vacuous attempt on the author. Classic marckism.\n \n \nIt doesn't really matter how many times you've said something, if it's not true. The last three chapters are about science more than they are about anything else.\n\n They're about how he reconciles his Catholic beliefs with a world that's understandable through science. I haven't claimed otherwise. I remember this even without the book currently in my possession. You have the book; how can you possibly make these claims without begging God for forgiveness for your blatant lies? Not very pious, are you?",
