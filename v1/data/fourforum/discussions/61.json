By the way how did lucifer become the devil???anyone?\n\n \n That was a similar argument used for every single scientific discovery since the beginning of time. Were is the Biblical proof that god doesn't want cloning? Those that said the earth was round instead of flat were labled heretics. Many people believed flying should be left to the birds that God created. In fact, some faith's still believe that science is wrong, medicine is a sin. It is a good thing that we don't let religion dictate our science, or we'd still be thumping eachother with clubs and eating raw meat.\n \n Pride caused the fall of the Son of Morning, not scientific discovery.",
