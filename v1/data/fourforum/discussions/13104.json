   "Of the 196 charges referred from the 2007 cases, 74 (38%) had been declined by a prosecutor as of October 16, 2008. A guilty plea was obtained on 46 charges (24%) and two charges (1%) resulted in guilty verdicts at trial. Eighty-six percent of the charges had been resolved, with 14% pending action by the prosecutor. (Table 6.) Twenty-two charges (11%) were dismissed after indictment and eight charges (4%) were dismissed as part of a plea agreement. (Appendix table F.) Reasons for dismissals were generally not specified in the records. However, in ten cases where a defendant pled guilty to a charge, an additional charge was dismissed.\n \n http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bjs/grants/227604.pdf",
