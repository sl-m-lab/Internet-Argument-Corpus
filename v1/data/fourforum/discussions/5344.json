   "A position of pro-choice is pro-life because the lives and quality of life of women are valued.\n \n To value women as such is to value their position as a part of humanity, as well as in the family, most usually as the main support of a family in terms of time-spent, emotional nurturance, maintenance, essentially, women are the mainstay of families. Often, as well, women are the main financial supporters of families.\n \n It must be remembered that children need a parent, especially when the only parent they have is a mother. To sacrifice the life of a mother in that situation to the life of a fertilized egg, an embryo, a fetus, is a heinous, anti-life crime. To demand such a sacrifice is to place families themselves on the altar of religious extremism, an extremism which denies women their right place in humanity, which sacrifices the welfare of children to a very narrow and restricted religious belief.\n \n Is a fertilized egg, a zygote, an embryo, a fetus that valuable that a woman, her life, health or quality of life should be sacrificed for its sake, that such a woman's children are less than a fertilized egg, embryo, etc., that they also must be sacrificed for the possible life of a fertilized egg, etc.?",

   "My point here is that it could be argued very reasonably as to whether or not a fertilized egg, a zygote, an embryo, fetus, etc., is a Someone.\n Sure, but then you get into all sorts of problems of classifications, slippery slopes, and other awkward messes. Arguing whether an embryo or a fetus is a person seems to raise more trouble than it might solve. It seems better to err on the side of caution and devise a pro-choice argument that assumes the embryo or fetus to be a person rather than worry whether they are a person.\n \nI do not argue so much the quality of llife of an individual woman but more for the quality of life, indeed of having access to life itself, of the children of the woman involved, because in many situations the concern and nurturance of a mother may be the only thing keeping children alive, especially in poor, war-torn nations that do not enjoy the relative wealth of the United States.\n True, but then you face problems such as which is better: to live in misery, or not live at all. Certainly it's better if a woman is able to raise her children in a stable environment and can adequately provide for them, but that seems to be taking a 'social benefits' angle on that matter. The problem with the social benefits angle is that it changes the question from a question of the mother's being able to choose to a question of what the mother should choose. \n \nAll forms of life? Animal life? Plant life? The mold growing in your bathroom?\n I'm sorry, but I thought it went without saying that we were discussing human life.\n \nI know of no one that is pro life believes the mother should die so the baby can live.\n Obviously not.

This guy is looked up to as a leader in bioethics.\n He is one the leading consequentialist ethicists, and by extension the bioethics in general. \n \nThe quality of life ethic rooted in relativity is arbitrarily defined by those who have been arbitrarily been given authority to decide.\n It's kind of funny that you say that because the 'quality of life ethic' that I've studied and worked on can be approached from several perspectives, with the consequentialist framework one among many. In particular I find that it works 'better' if you approach it from what I like to call the 'economics of ethics' (a deontological approach).\n \nIf you take the quality of life ethic and place it within a secular worldview with a utilitarian ethic then infanticide, euthanasia, and other atrocities are logical.\n Could you please explain how this works? I'm not sure I understand what you mean by these things and what logic you're using to derive these conclusions. \n \n However, you don't have to do this for these things to be logical. You merely have to have a quality of life ethic. There are many infants who are born with handicaps and genetic defects. Within the quality of life ethic we should spare them a horrific life of suffering and hardship and euthanize them. This is just one example. Now, you may not hold that view personally. However, if we make this ethic the base for our laws and interpretation of law and medicine, then we are at the mercy of those who have been randomly placed in positions power to decide and define \"quality of life\". Any definition they could conceive will be arbitrary.\n Randomly placed? Last I checked we in the West elected officials into office and exercised oversight over their activities. More to the point, I think that 'quality of life' can be defined in objective and non-arbitrary terms that may be checked through peer review and understood by non-specialists. \n \nSecularism is a religion in and of itself and skeptics place their faith in their ability to reason and reason rightly.\n Suit yourself. That's a bit like saying an indifference to religion is a religion, which seems to be confusing the sense in which the term 'religion' can be understood. Secularism is the intersection of a particular set of beliefs, values, and practices. There is nothing spiritual, supernatural, or even particularly systemic about it. It's more so a loose collection of pragmatic ideas driven by the desire to avoid religious conflict. Not to say that it isn't abused as an ideology, but just to say that it lacks the necessary components to be religious. \n \n And sure, some people fetishize 'reason' as some special power that people have. Less zealous (some would say less stupid) people know that 'reason' is merely the ability to act and think reasonably - working from notions of fallibility and good will. But then there are zealots everywhere getting carried away with whatever ideology strikes their fancy, and there's no point tarring everyone with the same brush. More to the point, treating secularism as a religion with a faith in reason is like treating christianity as a political ideology, a mistake. Such a mistake is like (is formally congruent with) mistaking a whale for a fish. \n \n I've posted these links from an online dictionary so that we're working from the same definitions. \n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=secularism\n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=religion \n \nWell then, what is your basis for morality? On what basis can you say that these acts are absolutely morally wrong? Do you acknowledge that this same dehumanization is done to those in the womb?\n My basis for morality? I treat morality economically, as the exercise of personal autonomy that each individual makes to maximize the interests of themselves and the interests of the group or community in which they participate. In my opinion the puzzle of the Prisoner's Dilemma stands as a simplified model of moral action, where cooperation is required between agents to satisfy these conditions. \n \n This means that I do not regard morality as absolute in the sense of being unconditional. Moral goodness is conditional upon the interests of the individual and upon their group. However there are events that are not right and can never be right, but these events are not such because they are absolute in the unconditional sense. Rather, these 'intrinisically wrong' events are wrong because there will always be a better alternative no matter the conditions. \n \n Likewise some events can never be wrong because either we cannot choose worse or because there is no choice in the matter. When we model possible states of the world economically in this fashion (to the appropriate level of resolution), we can mechanically derive a set of values such that we may objectively know what is necessarily right, necessarily wrong, and what may be right or wrong depending on the case. I'd like to point out that this moral theory allows us to evaluate moral action according to both 'absolute' and situational criteria.\n \n I say that authoritarianism and totalitarianism are always wrong, absolutely wrong, because they subordinate the interests of the individual to that of the group rather than holding those interests in well-balanced tension. Unless this tension is maintained the interests of individuals will be contravened such that resulting states of the world will be worse than otherwise. \n \n When you ask if I \"acknowledge\" that babies are dehumanized by abortion, I must answer that they are. The fact that babies are dehumanized, deprived of agency, by abortion must be considered in a particular context though. In the context of a free and open society in which abortion is the choice of the mother, this dehumanization must be permitted as the cost of avoid worse dehumanization of both babies, mothers, and possibly others.\n \n Depriving a woman of the legal option to abort her child is worse than allowing her the legal option to abort her child, because it dehumanizes the mother by denying her personal autonomy over her body, and will not avoid the dehumanization of the babies subject to illegal abortions and the dehumanization of those women who may be killed or maimed by such procedures (notably even more dangerous than legal abortions), and so on. There are also much potential danger in the political consequences of allowing such paternalism, particularly in the gradual slide towards authoritarian and totalitarian political states, but that's very much secondary to the immediate consequences for women.\n \n I think that everything should be done to make abortion a woman's last resort, as I abhore the practice and agree that it is morally costly. It would be better if abortions didn't happen, but prohibiting them is worse.",

   "If someone has a flat line they are dead. However, \"vegetable\" is a relative term (as witnessed by the terri schiavo case). I am not sure what you are getting at. Could you draw this out a bit more?\n Well, if there was a person who was permanently unconscious, basically a living and breathing corpse, would you choose to torture (say, break each toe on each foot) of another (unwilling) person who was fully conscious in order to save their life? I'm just asking to try and understand what you would do in such a morally problematic situation. People's responses to \"Damned if you do, damned if you don't\" situations can be very informative.\n \nWhat is wrong with that? With abortion and infanticide and euthanasia (all conclusions to the quality of life ethic) we have unchosen death at the mercy of arbitrary definitions of \"quality of life\".\n Like I tried to explain, without life, quality of life is meaningless in the sense that it isn't an issue. If someone isn't alive, then you don't have to worry about the quality of their life. If they are alive, then you do. The idea that something is better than nothing is, interestingly, the kind of argument that a consequentialist like Singer would use to argue against Singer's moral calculus that the aged, infirm, and disabled should be euthanized. \n \n Now the problem with affirming that a life of unchosen suffering is worse than death is that it ignores a person's choice in the matter. It's just as problematic as affirming that a chosen death is worse than a life of suffering. These situations are problematic because they ignore whether or not the life or death was chosen. \n \n I think we could say that a life of unchosen suffering is worse than a life of unchosen death if and only if that suffering contravened the agent's interests and the interests of the group (all other agents) worse than death would. \n \n So what's morally monstrous about the proposition that a life of unchosen suffering is better than death is that it ignores not only whether that death is chosen or not, but how it is chosen and by whom. \n \nIf you don't exist there is no quality of life. If you exist you can have a quality of life. You cant have a quality of life if you don't exist. Life and continuation of that life is necessary for any quality in that life. Therefore, life (and the sanctity [inherent value] of that life) is a prerequisite for and more foundational than the quality of that life.\n As I explained above, it's a mistake to think that because life is necessary for quality of life to be an issue that life has some inherent value. Life itself has no value. Value is determined by the relationships that the interests of agents have to one another.\n \nArbitrary scales and arbitrary numbers and arbitrary values.\n Yes, that's typically what we use when we want to give examples of formal properties. \n \nI haven't read this link yet but I will. Off the cuff, it seems to me that denying someone a status of \"personhood\" because of their location (in the womb), because of their dependence (completely dependent), because of their developmental status (early in development), because of their size (very small) is bigotry. This has been done before with slavery.\n That's why we aren't denying the fetus status as a person for those reasons.\n \nOnce again (based upon a quality of life ethic) we are about to make humans who we have arbitrarily deemed to be \"not persons\" the victims of selfishness and invented mechanisms to give other humans a certain \"quality of life\".\n I disagree with your assessment of the situation. Abortion has been legal in many countries for quite some time. Certainly many of the laws allowing abortion are poorly reasoned and worded, but these are not based, for the most part, on 'quality of life' ethics and are typically based on good old fashioned deontological ethics and classical liberal principles of rights and freedoms. Not the greatest ethics or legal principles, but they were pretty advanced for the Enlightenment. Maybe someday we will be able to institute more modern and effective systems of ethics and politics. \n \nTherapeutic human cloning is about to unleash the harvesting and slaughter of incalculable human beings (arbitrarily not deemed as \"persons\"). This will be the genocide of all genocides and takes the picture of Nazi Germany to another level.\n Maybe I don't know enough about therapeutic cloning, but I'm afraid I'm having trouble making the connection between allowing it and creating a totalitarian regime that persecutes its own citizens, and engages in territorial wars of aggression. \n \nThat said, what is your arbitrary \"definition\" of a \"person\"?\n I can't say that I have an arbtrary definition of a \"person\". If you're going to classify something, then it has to be done so that it is non-arbitrary and preserves some formally decidable distinction. Because personhood is a family resemblance grouping however, I would just take the term as primitive and undefined in any discussion of morality and interpret it on a case by case basis.",

So, what gives a more developed clump of cells the right to set a \"cut of point\" at a certain stage of development (for instance, when an organism obtains a brain, heart, and nervous system, it is no longer a clump of cells, but a human being) for a less developed clump of cells?\n \n So a \"smart\" clump of cells can make decisions for the \"stupid\" clump of cells?

Steeeve replied with \"you are a clump of cells.\" You tactfully responded with \"...you must be a clump of cells too.\" Thus having acknowledged that we are all a clump of cells, I asked you \"having acknowledged that we all are a clump of cells, what gives one clump of cells the right to terminate the life of another clump of cells?\" You responded to this question by quoting it and then posting this response \"[t]he clump of cells that has a brain and has developed human organs and lives in a society which has laws and has gone to schools, can read and write and has some knowledge will be better equiped to make decisions than a clump of cells which has none of these attributes - don't you think ?\" You mentioned the clump of cells that has gone to schools, can read and write, and has some knowledge (all references to intelligence) will be better equipped to make decisions... Now, you were either answering the question I asked by quoting the question and posting that response; or you flat out dodged the question by making some statement that had nothing to do with the question I asked. If you were answering the question, you established intelligence as the reason why one clump of cells can make decisions for another clump of cells. If you were not answering the question, then you ought to. So, having acknowledged that we are all a clump of cells, what gives one clump of cells the right to remove life from another clump of cells? I obviously know that an adult has the ABILITY to make decisions for the \"fertilized egg of say 3 weeks,\" what I am wondering is what JUSTIFIES the adult in making the decision to kill the \"fertilized egg of say 3 weeks?\"\n \n \n2) I have no prejudice against you for holding your views nor any desire to bring about your death for holding these views. According to your definition this must mean that I am not a bigot.\n\n My statement was \"... anyone who discriminates against another human being based upon their stage of development is a bigot.\" Anyone who would arbitrarily set up a certain stage of development as the point where humanhood begins, discriminate against human beings who have not attained to this stage by classifying them as non-humans, and then carry out this discrimination to the point of killing those human beings, would most certainly be a bigot.\n \n \n3) No, nothing justifys abortions, but we don't live in a perfect world. Which is the main difference between fundamentalists like you and me . I know that in this imperfect world we live in , abortions take place. Recognising reality (which is very hard for fundamentalists) , we have to choose the lesser of two evils - safe and legal or illegal and unsafe.\n\n So what about a fetus that posesses the attributes of humanhood you have established, i.e. a fetus posessing human organs? Is it ok to abort this living human being?\n \n \n4) ???? Why is that when I abundantly made it clear that I was talking about a fertilized egg of say 3 weeks , you chose to use the words 'infants' ?\n\n Because, if you think that the reason that one of two clumps of cells can make decisions for the other clump of cells, including the decision to remove life from the clump of cells (i.e. an adult making decisions for a \"fertilized egg of say 3 weeks\"), is because the adult is more intelligent than the \"fertilized egg of say 3 weeks,\" then consistent logic demands that we likewise hold the position that an adult (more intelligent) can make decisions for an infant (less intelligent). It was in this post that you led me to believe that intelligence was the reason that one clump of cells could choose to remove the life of another clump of cells. You have the perfect opportunity to clear this whole thing up in part one of this post. I obviously know that an adult has the ABILITY to make decisions for the \"fertilized egg of say 3 weeks,\" what I am wondering is what JUSTIFIES the adult in making the decision to kill the \"fertilized egg of say three weeks?\"",

You said all that just like you know what it is to be a woman or pregnant.\n \n Just what is \"the convenience of the mother\"? I love that rather \"convenient\" little statement. Is it money? Education? An abusive partner? Her age? Her emotional state? Addiction? Just what does inconvenience mean? And you talk about elitist? One doctor I don't know gets to tell me what is or is not convenient in my life!!!!????? Dang!\n \n You want to really do something? Quit screaming at and demonizing women who want control over their own decisions (God forbid) and make an effort to REALLY see what a woman with an unwanted pregnancy faces and help address those things. It will go miles more than all your screaching.\n \n And what is this clap trap about absolving men from their responsibility? Men absolve themselves every day - even after the kid is born. And sometimes having the bastard gone is the best thing in the world.\n \n Pregnancy and parenting are hardly mutually exclusive anyway.\n \n And I thank God for feminism every day. If it had been left to the woman-haters like you, I would either still be under the thumb of an abusive husband and/or unwilling to support the sacred lives that are me and my son. But who cares about that, right? As long as woman know their place and the babies get born.\n \n Abortion liberates nobody. Choice does.",

There are even men who love children who aren't theirs. For this I am more grateful than you know. My son has had the best mentor and male role model on the planet the past four years.\n \n Half of my two best friends is male. Most of my local pals are male since I hang out with musicians. And I should not have to tell a guy who has 23+ years bass experience the male to female ratio in the music world - especially rock and roll. \n \n However, some men need to be kicked to the curb. That was the case with my ex. I tried to raise my son with him. He was a cheap, abusive XXXXX. And the fact remains that dead beat dads are a problem. People, and in particular men, walk on their kids all too frequently. \n \n Regardless of your stand on abortion and your reasons for that stand - banning abortion will not suddenly increase responsibility in men or women. Only education and a consience will do that.\n \n I am all about reducing abortion through helping women and working at the root of the problem. Legislation will just make it invisiable to the weak bellied. \n I know where my line in the sand is - a pregnancy that threatens my health, life or livlihood will be ended - regardless of law. All women have their line in the sand. \n \n Demonizing a woman for being sexual or not wanting to be a mother is a poor way to encourage women to be responsible or to have any self esteem.\n \n You also scoff at feminism. And although I have no patience for the extremes of any issue, feminism is not an evil. The other extreme makes men the focus of women's lives. We have GOT to stop teaching girls this. A good relationship with a good man can be a wonderful part of your life - but we teach girls that it is their life. As long as we keep attachment to men as a measuring stick for the success of a woman - it will lead to sex. It's incredible what I have seen women put up with just they aren't stuck with the stigma of being single. They have sex with a guy to keep the guy and harbor the illusion that a loser will suddenly be a winner when faced with fatherhood. \n \n We waste energy, time and money fighting about a law that won't work when there are better ways to address this.\n \n And by the way - I was there when my mom was pregnant, several of my friends were pregnant, and have witnessed two births. Not the same as being pregnant or giving birth - I assure you. But really that is easy part - just wait until they start talking back.",
