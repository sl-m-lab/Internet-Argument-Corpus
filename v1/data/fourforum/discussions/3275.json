It's not a case of \"Either creationism or evolutionism is correct,\" it's a case of \"Either creationism, evolutionism, or some other theory is correct.\" There is a name for this fallacy, although I don't know it off the top of my head.\n\n Can you point out where this argument was made? If not, your post is an example of a 'fallacy' to the extent that not all anti-evolutionists are for instance young earthers. Dembski has called this \"the myth of fundamentalist intransigence\" * that only religious fundamentalists oppose evolution.\n \n Also, one argument oft cited is the challenge that people need to come up with another 'theory' to replace Darwinism.\n In part, Dembski also deals with this in the Introduction to his book...\n \"Consider the case of superconductivity. When the experimental evidence went against the existing theory, science did not require that a replacement theory be ready and available before establishing that the existing theory was inadequate...\n With regard to superconductivity, the Dutch physicist Kamerling Onnes diverted the phenomenon in 1911. Superconductivity refers to the complete disappearance of electrical resistance for materials at low temperatures. When Onnes made his discovery, however, there was no theory to account for superconductivity. Such a theory was not proposed until 1957. It was called the BCS theory after scientists Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer, who received the Nobel Prize for physics for it in 1972. The first paragraph of the Nobel press release describes the BCS theory as providing \"a complete theoretical explanation of the phenomenon.\" But the theory didn't stay complete for long. In the 1980s Bednorz and Muller discovered superconductors at much higher temperatures than previously identified and explained by BCS. To date, no replacement theory for BCS has been found that extends to high-temperature superconductors. BCS, instead of being \"the theory of superconductivity,\" now merely explains a quite limited range of superconductors.\"\n Dembski, W. A. (ed) \"Uncommon Dissent: Intellectuals who Find Darwinism Unconvincing\", page xxxi\n \n In part, this may be impossible anyway, given that some Intelligent Designers are seeking scientific proofs in a climate where many (including posters on this forum, viz Mach) believe it is of itself impossible - because of their own beliefs as to the limits of the pursuit of science.\n \n *page xxii \"Uncommon Dissent\" (Dembski, Ed)",

Half? More than half? Maybe ZERO? You say you're not an expert, yet obviously you speak of what is, and is not possible, and of the limitations of science as if they are my own. Does that not bother you?\n \n For anyone readings this that might not understand everything about science, what Montalban wants changed about science, is that he wants it to include:\n \n - The Easter Bunny (no evidence, but we tell our kids abou it)\n \n - Psychics (no evidence, but boy do they rake in the cash)\n \n - Purple People Eaters (no evidence, but there was a gingle about it)\n \n - Floating magical islands that are invisble (no evidence)\n \n - Vampires (no evidence, exept all the shows and books on it)\n \n - Werewolves (no evidence, except all the shows and books on it)\n \n - King Kong (no evidence, except of course the MOTION PICTURES!)\n \n - The Jolly Green Giant (No evidence except the picture on a can of green beans)\n \n - This cancer drug might \"look\" like water, but really it has mystical properties and can \"heal\" you.\n \n - While this bridge may not \"look\" sturdy, it's made of magical support beams that I promise you, CAN support the weight, despite what physics says.\n \n etc.\n etc.\n etc.\n \n Montalban, if you DON'T want science to include these things, please tell us where you draw the line. Since you used my name and then cited my refusal to agree to changing the limitations of science (as if I have a say in it), let's hear YOUR new proposed limitations of science.\n \n Please, if it doesn't include ALL of the above things, then you're back to requiring:\n \n 1. Sufficient Evidence\n \n Which is all science asks for! Wow, imagine requiring sufficient evidence to make claims!!!! What a WONDROUS IDEA!!\n \n Sorry, science cannot, and does not, include the things you wish it to. That's why you're stuck with RELIGION (does not require evidence), and not SCIENCE (requires evidence)\n \n Why so sad at being stuck with religion and not science? Why can you not just accept your chosen lot with the irrational?\n \n I'm sure as you rail against the foundations of science some scientists is finding yet another way to improve your life through knowledge. While you continue to \"teach the controversy\". Of course, there is no controversy in science with regards to this issue either, the only controversy is that you, specifically you in this case, would like to have your selfiish needs accepted by science.\n \n 1. What limitations are YOU suggestion for science?\n \n Please, we're all ears. The self-proclaimed failure in science wants the foundations of science to be changed.\n \n Is that not amusing? Might you first try to know enough about science to understand why it's the way it is in the first place? Nah, that would be too rational.\n \n -Mach",

It's too facile of you to dismiss contributions by saying stuff like \"you miss the debate\". As I've said before, trying to follow your line of argument is difficult enough without having to put up with lofty disdain when some ambiguous point is questioned.\n\n It was not meant to be a criticism of you, but a fact of the matter that we, Mach and I, have had a long running debate - into which you enter at a late stage - thus when I make a short sentence such as the one you question, much of the 'blanks' are already filled in by our (his and mine) debate.\n So to try to summarise...\n What is science meant to answer? That is in effect the question Mach and I have been debating. For him, science can only deal with materialistic/naturalistic processes, anything beyond that is not science. Further, the only 'evidences' he accepts are scientific ones. Therefore he concludes there is no God. Why? Because there's no evidence for God, based on the idea that the only evidence he accepts are those dealt with by science. I believe that this is rather circular. He does not.\n \n I pointed out that there are other theories of evolution that don't discount the super-natural, (his version of science can never account for such). There are those in the Intelligent Design community who believe that we can decipher enough about nature to find a design, and where there's a design, a designer is implied. This is a branch of science that he has not really commented upon.\n \n There are those who believe in the \"Fitness of Nature\". Thus the notion that Mach has about science, and in particluar evolutionary science is that of a philosophy of science.\n \n Further insight into this can be seen when I replied to another poster\n \nBut evolutionary science is the physical realm,\n\n \n No. One focus of the evolutionary science that you speak of is the physical realm, but that is a philosophy of science to deem that science should only be about the material world. It is the form of science taught 'as' science in most western educational systems, but it remains a philosophy of science.\n \n Other forms of evolutionary science don't deal with just the physical (see below an interesting theory on the 'Fitness of the Environment'. You simply believe that there is one evolutionary science, it is normative, everything else is not evolutionary science.\n \n \"The real problem with the evolution debate is not empirical Darwinism. Rather, it is a sort of theory creep in which a bold but circumscribed scientific claim becomes conflated with a much more sweeping philosophical claim. The philosophical claim is then presented as though it were a confirmed scientific fact. Metaphysical Darwinism maintains that the theory of natural selection has successfully reduced all teleological and normative phenomena to the interplay of chance and necessity, thus eliminating purpose and value from our picture of the world. Metaphysical Darwinists regard belief in objective values as primitive superstition, on a par with a belief in witches and ghosts. What is worse, they perpetrate a fraud on the public by draping their profoundly speculative philosophy with the mantle of scientific authority.\n \n James Barham \"Why I am Not a Darwinist\", in Dembski, W. A. (ed) \"Uncommon Dissent: Intellectuals who Find Darwinism Unconvincing\", p178. \n \n \nand has a lot of cumulative evidence to support itself, though admittedly I know little of the subject and bring my pre-existing biases with. But to reject the theory out of hand is,Why hold to such a radical position, especially when it doesn't seem necessary? \n\n \n You will have to explain the 'necessary' aspect of this further.\n \n The mechanistic process in Darwin's idea is disputed by other theories of evolution. Lawrence Henderson wrote \"Fitness of the Environment\" \n \n You can see a very large tract on it at http://www.members.iinet.net/~sejones/pe06envr.html . The earth seems so suited for life, it can't have been by chance that life came about by chance. The inference is that there's an intelligence/blueprint behind it. This does not mean that the Christian God is proved by it, or God in any definition. BUT it is a form of evolutionary theory that tackles the problems of the holes in Darwin's mechanistic models.\n \n Michael Denton agrees with when he states that the gene-centric theory of neo-Darwinism - is insufficient to explain all aspects of biology. He states \"Yet by the late 1980s it was becoming obvious to most genetic researchers, including myself, since my own main research interest in the '80s and '90s was human genetics, that the heroic effort to find the information specifying life's order in the genes had failed. There was no longer the slightest justification for believing that there exists anything in the genome remotely resembling a program capable of specifying in detail all the complex order of the phenotype... From being 'isolated directors' of a one-way game of life, genes are now considered to be interactive players in a dynamic two-way dance of almost unfathomable complexity, as described by Keller in \"The Century of the Gene\"\n \n Michael John Denton \"An Anti-Darwin Intellectual Journey\", in Dembski, W. A. (ed) \"Uncommon Dissent: Intellectuals who Find Darwinism Unconvincing\", p172.\n \n He gives examples of the folds in RNA which happen consistently, and independently of genetic coding... but these rules governing the folds... \"These laws of protein form are strictly equivalent to the rules that govern the way atoms are combined into molecules or subatomic particles are combined into atoms to generate the periodic table of elements...\n \n The folds present stunning evidence, perhaps the first clear evidence discovered in biology, that highly complex organic forms can be generated by natural law. With the folds, the impossible has become possible - the basic building blocks of nature are specified in abstract laws of form and are not simply a mechanical program in the genes. They are lawful, emergent, self-organising forms and not contingent 'cleverly contrived machines'. Here is a set of forms that arise directly out of the basic properties of matter, confirming the inference I had previously drawn from reading Henderson, that life might be encoded in the basic properties of matter.\"\n \n Ibid, pp173-74\n \n \n \n Thus science reveals in the formation of RNA a chink in the gene-centric universe of Darwinism.",

An acknowledgement for this limitation is another reason to be wary of attributing the nature of life to a very human outlook, conscious design.\n\n Firstly\n This is one of the most intelligent posts I've seen on the evolution/creation debates for a while (and I am not being sarcastic -I find your words a refreshing change in that you have delivered a clear concise statement devoid of insults - not suggesting that you are normally insulting). You have shown how it can be done.\n \n Secondly,\n And this might seem all the more strange. I do not necessarily believe in the ID debate. I post their stuff to show that there is an alternative view that can exist within science. The ID debate doesn't point to God, but they at least don't cut themselves off from the possibility of God.\n \n Thirdly,\n The power of the mind is also used to paste over problems in mechanistic evolutionary models - such as several ideas on how the eye evolved. Darwin himself started this error of judgemnt off becuase he couldn't explain how the human eye evolved, and was therefore forced into a conjecture by showing a whole series of already existing eye forms and suggestng that perhaps they themselves show a possible evolutionary path.\n The idea goes something like this...\n look at a critter with a photo-sensitive patch, then another with a cusp that makes light direction onto the patch descernable, etc, up to the eye in a modern human.\n http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/01/1/l_011_01.html\n I know it's just present as a 'possibility'\n \n I gave this tract a while ago\n Some people have declared that our eyes, if the part of a designer, are poorly designed. I don't see this. What I do see is an eye that allows us to enjoy beauty, art etc. Sure, we don't have X-ray vision, but our eyes are good enough. (I mention X-ray vision; what basis do people lay claim that our eyes aren't good enough; that we can't see through walls?)\n \n If we can now focus on possible evolutionary path-ways for the eye, we will see that evolutionaries have an eye for make believe.\n \n The classic case (http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/01/1/l_011_01.html) Darwin looked at several existing eye structures, and suggested that this progression of simplest to more complex types of eyes might be suggestive of a path taken in human eye evolution.\n \n Firstly, the core word is 'might'. Thus it is not the all conclusive proof Darwinists would suggest. Where is the evidence that random changes did occur as they say? What caused these changes? Why were they only positive changes? As Michael Behe points out there's enormous complexity in re-arranging the DNA just to get a depression...Behe, M, \"Darwin's Black Box\", p16ff. Where is the molecular explanation?\n The Darwinist say...\"Every change had to confer a survival advantage, no matter how slight.\" Why? What about dead-ends? What about negative mutations?\n \n What Darwin has shown is what we can call 'conceptual evolution'.The logic behind this is akin to showing a series of pictures: skateboard, bicycle, motor-bike, motor car, etc. We can see that they get more complex, but did the design for a car stem from that of a skateboard? We see the connection between these things (eyes, vehicles etc) because we organise it in our brains... but I'm not going to explain perceptual organisation. \n \n There are other explanations (http://www.biol.lu.se/funkmorf/vision/evolution.html) The Lund Vision Group shows computer modelling to suggest how a complex human eye could evolve (see under Computer Modelling)\n \"the structures of a focused camera type eye can evolve in less than half a million generations\" (Ibid.)\n Wow that's quick... so in all that time we're to assume that they went around with mutations that still hadn't quite produced a working eye. It's a shot in the dark, but it might work, providing that the intervening generations didn't need proper vision! \n \n In just six diagrams we get a model of the eye. This is again a case of conceptual evolution... seeing patterns that are meaningless unless you draw a connexion between them. Richard Dawkins is so impressed with this that he features the image on his web-page.\n \n The fraud is more clearly seen at http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/creation/eye_stages.html\n \n If you look at the few diagrams here, starting with a light sensitive patch, moving to a more complex eye, we can see the deception of using a rubbery model. The thin line at the top of the light-sensitive spot does not change in each model, yet in the end is the lens! The light-sensitive spot wouldn't have a lens... so the one little line which remains the same in each picture represents in fact vastly different things.\n \n Richard Dawkins claims that the eye is, by fact that it is poorly designed, proof against a creator.\n This is an interesting logical flaw. By stating a subjective view of an eye as a conclusive proof he has left hismelf open to attack.\n How is the eye 'flawed'? He claims because it is 'poorly wired'. But the eye does function, and does so quite admirably.\n Further, by stating that he can see a 'poor design' likewise we can now look for 'good design' to discern a designer!\n \n That is to say, if he can show that some things have evolved, simply by how they are put together, we can now look at how all thigns are put together in order to see if there is proof of a good order, and therefore a good design, therefore a designer.\n Thanks Dawkins!\n \n But getting back to the evolution of 'the eye', Behe compares it in a similar way to what you tocuh upon - the mind filling in details.\n He said that if you take a series of pictures; say a skateboard, bike, motor-bike, car, aeroplane, etc. we can see that these are progressively more complex things in a series - of transportation vehicles. But to get from one to the other, through 'evolution' is much more difficult - same with the eye, to get even from the light-sensitive spot to mean anything, it's no good just having the spot, but some kind of device (brain, perhaps) to make sense of the incoming data",

   "So to try to summarise...\n What is science meant to answer? That is in effect the question Mach and I have been debating. For him, science can only deal with materialistic/naturalistic processes, anything beyond that is not science. Further, the only 'evidences' he accepts are scientific ones. Therefore he concludes there is no God. Why? Because there's no evidence for God, based on the idea that the only evidence he accepts are those dealt with by science.

He does not.\n .\n\n I'm not going to attempt to deal with the many points you make in such a \n long and complex statement; and it would be rude to butt in on your\n debate with Mach.\n I just want to focus on the part of your statement quoted above and try\n replying to \"What is science meant to answer\"?\n Science is seeking truthful answers to questions about the material world.\n The route to those answers is through the gathering and evaluation of\n evidence using the rules of scientific method.

I am not anti-science to believe that science has limits in that it can't test for these things.\n \n Secondly, do you think that science can prove miracles? I know that when miracles are claimed for, the Catholic Church has a panel (including scientists) that examine the claims. If something can't be shown to have happened by naturalistic means, or by artificial ones, then by definition, not having a scientific answer, it is deemed a miracle - that's what miracles are. Science can certainly test weeping statues of Mary and determine if they are caused by melting wax, evaporation, other fakery etc. Of course I recognise that not having a scientific answer is different from providing proof that God did it.",

   "No. You have belly-ached on this matter at every instance, but only when I make large posts. Not others. Like how you try point-scoring interjections on whether I've said Evolution = tautology, and yet let it pass when someone on your side actually says it (I never said it). Thus you're not here to 'debate' as such as to shout-down with lame arguments people from the creationist side.\n Hence you make claims about science, but don't back these up with science, and you make a very odd argument that's moving all over the place - size of response/you can't read it/understand it or whatever; you're yet to actually make up your mind what it is you're actually objecting to - other than it's from me. (Even throwing in a question (such as below) when we've already gone over it). I know ciricular reasoning is your forte, but to actually keep asking the same questions again and again - and you get answers.\n Conversely, you've still yet to prove your version of science is science, as you believe - whereas I've already shown several versions of science that exist.\n \n It hurts when you feel this type of debate?\n \n Yawn. We've already gone over the idea of yours that science is that which is based on evidences that is from materialistic/naturalistic sources.\n\n \n This is your second refusal to back up what you said both about the topic, and specifically, about me. Forfeit or ante up Montalban.\n \n \n1. What limitations, specifically, do you think \"we are imposing\" on science?\n 2. What limitations, specifically, do you think I \"believe\" science has?\n 3. What limiations, if any, do you believe science has?\n \n Can you answer these claims you made, while using my name, or will you withdraw them? If you cannot also support your knowledge of \"other posters on this forum\" also believe these things, again, please withdraw them.\n\n \n I would like you to clarify your position, for everyone on the forum to see. Not this hand-waivy \"well Mach thinks this and it's not widely accepted\" garbage I see strewn about your posts.\n \n Can I answer for you then? Since you obviously like answering for me...\n \n 1. You believe things like the existence of the easter bunny and superman should be admitted into science as rational beliefs, based on word-of-mouth evidence.\n \n 2. You think that there are somehow \"different versions\" of science that is based on rational thinking and sufficient evidence.\n \n 3. You have not taken the time to back up your arguments. Why is it a good thing to incorporate fantasy into science and call it rational? Of course, your only answer is, because your dogma, i.e., other humans, tell you that science is wrong. Note, science comes from observation, your brand of dogma comes from some fallable human's imagination (with no evidence).\n \n 4. You seem to specifically like to attack evolution, probably because it's the crux of what your dogma, not rational thinking or evidence, disagrees with. You approach evolution as if it were in controversy, where it clearly is not. Why do you attempt to mislead? (See #3) You approach the problem like this:\n \n Step 1. Evolution and science are \"obviously\" wrong because they disagree with what my congregation believes. \n Step 2. Without having taken the time, by your own account, to understand evolution, you proceed to debate against it, for all to see on this forum, the process of evolution, and attempt to discredit it with cut and pasted nonsense.\n \n Wrong reason to believe, and wrong reason to attack a belief, but then again, that's obvious to most people.\n \n I thought for a while you might start to eek out some reason and rational obsevations, I suppose I was wrong, but I still have hope.\n \n -Mach",

   "I've noticed that many creationists spend much of their time trying to refute the theory of evolution rather than trying to prove their own theory to be correct. I will point this out, to both creationists and evolutionists alike, that refuting evolutionism does not necessarily prove creationism, and vice versa. It's not a case of \"Either creationism or evolutionism is correct,\" it's a case of \"Either creationism, evolutionism, or some other theory is correct.\" There is a name for this fallacy, although I don't know it off the top of my head.\n\n \n While I'm not a Christian, I've come to realize that the scientific establishment, too, is divided into rational and irrational thinkers.\n \n Our science knows a lot... yet prudence dictates we realize that our science has only chipped away at the \"grand scheme of things\". Evidence abounds of things our science has yet failed utterly to explain.\n \n Take ghosts, for example. Or UFO's. You bring up these subjects before some so-called scientists and \"rational thinkers\", and they'll work themselves into an apoplexy shouting you down, and proclaiming you to be \"irrational\". When in fact, these things are fully arguable either way.\n \n Image the discomfort of these \"rational thinkers\" if ten years from now, or a hundred, or a thousand, science proves that in fact, ghosts do exist! Just as the Church fumed and stanced itself when Galileo first posited that all things do not in fact revolve about the Earth... and later that same Church was quietly embarrassed when other scientific minds bore him out.\n \n Now, I bring this up because evidence also exists that the history of our world might not be quite as simple as many would advocate. The very sudden rise of \"homo sapien\" on our planet is shrouded in mystery, and if you ask me, is not at all completely explained by modern evolutionary science.\n \n On the other hand, you have weird evidence, such as the Piri Reis collection of maps, the Dogon star legends, the common myths of \"flying chariots\", \"dragons\", and \"gods from the sky\" from cultures all over the world (not to mention a HUGE number of other common myths), and last, but not least, some pyramids in South America made of very, very big rocks. Rocks which are so big, modern engineers cannot move them in one piece!\n \n I offer no weird, crazy conspiracy theories to explain these things. I offer only rational evidences which might point to a timeline of our world which is not quite what all the so-called \"rational thinkers\" insist it be. Make your own conclusions.\n \n I only want to say one thing: I believe in science. Not the shouting and arguing and pride and puffy-chestedness of science... but the rational thought, and the process of science.\n \n If one day science bears out ghosts, then that'll sure be interesting. And if one day it disproves them, then that'll be one less dumb superstition for people to worry about.\n \n And the same thing goes for the history of this planet.",

Science can most definitely support belief in these more clearly defined definitions of love.\n \n I think you can also make definitions of love that are NOT verifiable using science.

   "Could you re-word the first few sentences as they don't make sense. And I'm not just talking about spelling. \n\n \nCertainly. I can understand how you would be unable to understand what I meant. I can usually fill in the lapses in the posts of others because I have an understanding of the language. I comprehend thoughts, even though words are missing or misspelled. Obviously, you can't.\n\n As you said earlier, an adult, polite way would be to say thank you. :)\n I have no problem with making mistakes, with those who admit to doing so. You have a problem though, as you can't seem to stand it when you're caught out. That's why you continue to return to this forum and make the same apology for Charles Darwin's mistake.\n \n\n Here's what I meant:\n Whoa! The ultimate bait and switch winner has emerged. Go back and show where Mach mentioned proof. He didn't you say? Then why did you imply that when he said that \"science has shown\" that he meant \"proved?\" Could it be that you didn't understand the words? Could it be that you are a scientific illiterate? Read it again and follow with your finger - move you lips if it helps. He didn't even imply that it is absolute that the world is 4.55 billion years old. \n\n No you missed how he was arguing between certainty, testability, rationality etc, which he believes is science, and non-rational, subjectiveness which he perceives is religion. That's why he compares it to a 'truth'. He runs the two in parallel.\n \nMach: \"2+2 = 4\"\n Joe: \"My bible clearly states that 2+2=1, so you're incorrect\".\n \n Mach: \"Science shows the earth is around 4.55 billion years old according to all of the available evidence\"\n Joe: \"That's incorrect. My bible clearly states the age of the earth to be no more than around 6000 years old.\n\n It is a rhetorical ploy akin to push-polling. He gets us to think along a certain line - science is for the self-evident truth of 2+2 =4, whilst the irrational religious person \"Joe\", is for a non-truth 2+2=1 based on what his religion says. And in parallel, science says one thing, and the already ridiculed religious person says another. He is guiding you to a conclusion, problem is you've already made it.\n \nSadly, it took two keystrokes. Your command of English seems a bit below par for a native speaker. My meaning was evident to anyone who has a grasp of the language. I'm sorry that you have such difficulty with the language and will try to proof read my messages in the future. Please refrain from your typical ad hominems in the future. If you can't discuss the topic, then why bother. Your insults only demonstrate the hypocrisy of Christianity.\n\n What ad hominem? Is it ad hominem to say that I don't understand what you've written? It was not meant to be an attack on you, but an admission on my part. However...\n \nMaybe that ad hominem needs be challenged. Did you have anything in mind? Nope. Just one of your trade-marks.\n\n \nAd hom? What are you talking about? I didn't attack you. I challenged your assertions. Is there some sort of intellectual disconnect going on here? Are you unable to distinguish disagreement with your unsupported assertions and out of context quotes with personal attack? How sad for you. You have my pity. Life must be very difficult for you.\n\n You think my ideas about science are misguided. Then you link it up with what you think I think about Orthodoxy.\n You said...\n \nMaybe we doubt that your opinions about Orthodox Christianity are as misguided as you ideas about science.\n\n You are quite clearly calling into account now my knowledge of Orthodoxy. If you've got an actual example, present it. I doubt you'll do this as it's not your style. You prefer generalised mud-slinging. Hence...\n \nThat's why I give specifics, such as Mach calling exobiology 'science fiction', yet he also supports it as science.\n\n \nI missed that. Somehow I don't believe that the case is as you represent.\n\n Then check out the Science and Math thread.\n \nI would have to read the statement in context. You don't seem to have a very good sense of context. You seem to hang on individual words rather than the meaning of more complex syntactical structures. In short, since I have seen several of your quotes out of context, (some of mine as well) I don't place any credibility in any of your quotes of others. You aren't a very good historian and you seem to misrepresent the intent, and even the actual words of others, quite frequently.\n\n Yes, as I said, this is the generalised attack you opt to make. Its an unproved statement.\n \nWhat do you think? \n\n \nI think that you are dishonest and only semiliterate. I think that you have no idea of what science is or how it works. I think that you are motivated by the mythology of ancient nomads that you believe is ultimate truth.\n Since you asked, I offered my opinion. I suspect that you will again ban me because you know how foolish you make yourself appear. Oh, well. Can't stand the heat because you know how silly your assertions are.\n\n Many people oppose me on this forum (and this isn't the only forum I debate on); Close_slave_can, Mach, Kronus, etc. You seem to think that being rude is the same as 'debate' and that if someone objects to you being rude, then they can't stand to debate. You are the only one who is continually rude - so much so that no matter how many times you re-enter this debate forum you automatically return to the same type of debate and are thus easily spotted. CLUE: I put out a 'feeler'; the statement about me and high school biology, and you can't help but use it. You do so EVERY time, you're the only one who does it. That's one of the reasons I've no problem stating it. I point this out just to show how to avoid this in future - if you can... I doubt it. :) I would prefer if you didn't use this, and actually try to debate me. But nope, time and time again you return, are easily recognised by your automatic responses. I told you I study information (including the use of language) and also epistemology. Your formal study in biology has ill-prepared you for actual debate and you give yourself up so readily by returning to the same insults. At least next time, try and come up with something original :) How long have you been doing the same thing now? You've debated me now over a year.\n But anyway, I wasn't asking you for your opinion on me... so eager are you to give it. I asked you directly after stating what Mach said on exobiology - that he believes it is science fiction. The question was in the context of that statement. You seem to have both recognised this, by commenting on it; believing it taken out of context, but unable to help yourself, you give an opinion of me too. :)",

   "You've in effect re-worded the old puzzle if a tree falls in a forest and no one's around, does it make a sound?\n \n\n It's the root of the question you posed on if love exists without humans (or life) around, many philosophical, even scientific, journeys lead to this basic question, but again, that's not the topic here, although it's a good topic for another thread.\n \n \nThen for you, or your posturing about 'love' being found by science is now reversed? First you said it could be found/defined by science, now it's real only in a philosophical sense?\n\n I have said, and say again, and again:\n \n 1. My definition of love, the what..3 I've given you so far? Are all verifiable and have sufficient evidence to warrant belief. I can only ASSUME you had some definition of love that was NOT verifiable.\n \n 2. You let us know that your definition is either love is god, or love cannot be without god. Both of which, for this argument, are good enough to debate.\n \n 3. Yes, we all know, and we don't need to repeat it here (or do we?) that things that have no evidence are not rational to believe in, and are not knowable through any means, including...yes, science. So by your choice of definitions of love (love = god), it's by definition supported by a dogma as premise, and it doesn't need science or sufficient evidence to make it's claims. Your confusion confuses me.\n \n \nNot entirely true. Religion is also based on observation. I have mentioned witnesses to miracles, people speak with God etc.\n\n Montalban, bigfoot is based on a few witnesses, so is the loch ness monster. So is the easter bunny, I'm sure there are a few poor souls out there who have \"seen\" the easter bunny.\n \n So you get to make a choice Montalban. You can either accept ANY AND ALL fantasy-land as rational, worthy of belief, and worthy of scientific support (not even investigation, you want dogmatic belief), or you can accept that for science to consider it \"known\", or \"knowable\", or \"rational\", or \"reasonable to believe in\", requires that it exist in the physical universe, and requires sufficient evidence. Which is it gonna be Montalban. Shall we change the foundations of reason, logic, science, etc., to allow in trolls and bigfoot and witchcraft and boogeymen and psychics, just because you find certain specifics in science are troublesome since they don't agree with your brand of religious dogma? That's a yes or no question.\n \n \nProve this, using science. If you can't, then your belief is actually philosophy or dogma!\n\n Burden of proof is on you buddy, you know that right? These are categorizations, and don't require \"proof through science\" though, just basic english language skills with a smattering of common sense.\n =================\n \n Mathematics is by definition a science, look it up.\n \n \"Science\" : A broad term in this case I'm using it to encompass life sciences, cosmology, geology, etc., I'm sure you can fill in the rest.\n \n Psychology: Partially based in science, while parts extend beyond or current ability to provide evidence for or against.\n \n Philosophy: Depending on your philosophy, some require evidence by definition, some do not, and some we do not and possible cannot know if evidence for or against can be found.\n \n Finally, your favorite, DOGMA. \n \"a religious doctrine that is proclaimed as true without proof \"\n \n There's your dead ringer!\n \n So to summarize with those in mind:\n Mathematics: To prove something in mathematics requires formal proof in logic (in math's logical language).\n \n The more general \"Science\", such as physics, life science, etc.:\n It's understood that all science can theoretically be proven by mathematics, but mathematics has not progressed to that level yet. So science accepts verfiable, repeateble evidence, using the various methods of science. Since it is not genreally fully supported through mathematics, science progresses, and often corrects it's conclusions based on newer evidence, or evidence that previous theories are shown to be testable as false.\n \n Philosophy: Those areas requiring rational analysis/logic, etc. to arrive at beliefs, are by definition beliefs that require rational analysis, logic, etc. However, philosophy also encompasses those things NOT requiring evidence..i.e. metaphysics, among other fields. So, some of philosophy requires sufficient evidence, some does not, by definition.\n \n Saving the best for last, your personal favorite (I'm guess here on it being your favorite)....\n \n DOGMA!!\n \n \"DOGMA: a religious doctrine that is proclaimed as true without proof \"\n \n Did I read that right? Proclaimed true WITHOUT PROOF? I did, and so did you.\n \n So....in summary:\n \n Mathematics: Requires formal proof\n Science: Requires sufficient evidence, parsimony suggests can all eventually be verified mathematically\n Philosophy: Some philosophy requieres sufficient evidence, some does not, and some we don't even know if there CAN be shown through evidence.\n Dogma: claims truth but requires no evidence/proof.\n \n I don't think you'll disagree with this in general.\n \n \nWhoa! The ultimate strawman winner has emerged. Science hasn't 'shown' it has suggested. You are now going to do a bait switch from science not really being able to prove something, to now saying it's absolute that the world is 4.55 billion years old?\n\n \n I said specifically::\n \"Science shows the earth is around 4.55 billion years old according to all of the available evidence\"\"\n \n You lie in your rebuttal, to put it bluntly. Either that or you misread my statement, or didn't comprehend it. You decide.\n \n \nMore insulting straw-man. It is insulting to suggest that religious people are not rational.\n\n \n It's irrational to take offense at that.\n \n Here's why:\n \n Rational:(webster) \n relating to, based on, or agreeable to reason \n \n Reason: (webster) a sufficient ground of explanation or of logical defense; especially : something (as a principle or law) that supports a conclusion or explains a fact <the reasons behind her client's action< d : the thing that makes some fact intelligible :\n \n (webster) \n Dogma: \"a religious doctrine that is proclaimed as true without proof \"\n \n To believe in something without sufficient evidence, proof, etc. is irrational by definition. So no, I'm not insulting you, I'm reasoning you.\n \n \n\n You did a switch now. A while ago you attempted to show science in the concept of love. Now you've given up. However, do you now suggest love does, or doesn't exist? It's quite easy - 'yes' or 'no'. If 'yes' then you accept something exists without scientific proof.\n\n Switch? You call logical steps a \"switch\"? You believe love = god, god does not require proof, therefore it's by definition a dogma, and by definition NOT something that science can rationalize. That's according to your definition of love. I'd appreciate if you concede on that point, it's over, right?\n \n \nWhat we've seen is you take unreasonable positions on maths and drinking - assigning as by analogy - irrational behaviour to those who are religious - and then arguing against that!\n\n \n I'm stunned that you can think this.\n \n I say again, THEY ARE THE SAME THING, IT'S A SIMPLE LOGICAL ANALOGY:\n \n Dogma: Considered true without requiring evidence/proof.\n \n (setting: takes place in our good ole universe)\n \n BOBBY-JOE: MY CHICKEN LAYS GOLDEN FREAKING EGGS\n BETTY-SUE: PROVE IT.\n BOBBY-JOE: I DON'T HAVE TO, I DON'T NEED TO HAVE EVIDENCE, IT'S A DOGMA.\n BETTY-SUE: Then, I believe your chicken lays golden eggs.\n \n Q. Is BETTY-SUE making a rational conclusion, or an irrational conclusion, based on the evidence that no egg has ever been witnessed to lay golden eggs, and that there is no reasons to suspect any chicken has the plumbing to form and squeeze out a hunk of pure Au, and that the only evidence she has his her immature brother's verbal claim, a brother who has been known to be incorrect about his claims in the past. \n \n Check one:\n A. Rational\n B. Irrational\n \n You think I'm using strawman? It's LOGIC 101.\n \n Replace chicken/egg with God, you know, subsititue the variable, and you'll do fine with it, trust me.\n \n \n\n Not at all. My religion says nothing about digital watches, stereo TVs, aeroplanes etc. I'm happy with science there.\n Further, you completely misrepresent me on this, as I've already posted a number of times the following\n \"Long ago (in the 4th century!) one of the Church's teachers Vasilius the Great wrote about this. He advised the Orthodox Christians neither to rely upon the scientific data in order to provide foundation for their faith in Christ, nor to try to disprove them, because \"the scientists permanently disprove themselves.\"\n http://www.pravoslavie.ru/english/age-of-earth.htm\n It is not the Orhodox way to tie our dogma to science, but hey, since you're about ignoring what I say, and prefer to argue what you'd like me to have said, so be it. Yes, if that were my position, but it's not. So, re-constructing the position of religious people into straw-man, arguing against that, and voila, you've got your version of debate.\n\n \n Your point is not only not progressing your side of the debate, it's taking you right back to irrationality. \n \n The only thing you seem to disagree with science on are those parts that do not accept your religious dogma. Of course you won't get far denying digital watches work, please DO take that stance and we can fly to Australia and force you to watch them work. However, since you've chosen only those scientific theories that have sufficient evidence, and choose to debate them with, of all things, a dogma, then I cannot see how you think your position is valid. Here's another analogy for you so it's easier to choke down:\n \n Method: I dig for 10 feet and then pan for gold in the hole I made. I use this same method every time, there is a video camera on me and 10000 witnesses, etc., etc. You can repeat my methods and arrive at the same results.\n \n Out of 100 times, I find gold in only 10 areas, labeled A-K.\n \n Dogma: There is no gold in area D and G, and we require no proof to show this is true.\n \n Conclusion: There is no gold in area D and G, despite the fact that the gold-digger found gold there with verifiable methods, and sufficient evidence.\n \n Now, that in and of itself is enough to shut this argument down, but you take it a step further.\n \n OK, I don't disagree with A, B, C, E, F, H, I, J having gold, that's OK with me. I just disagree with two of them, specifically because my dogma opposes them. Despite the fact that you use the SAME METHOD FOR ALL DIGS, I \"choose\", based on a dogma, to not believe only two of them.\n \n So, yes, science uses the exact same methods for it's knowledge aquisition, yet you choose, based on a religious dogma, to selectively choose specific claims of science, that disagree with your dogma, despite the evidence (since you require none), and then you somehow accept all of the other claims of science, even though they were all based on the same exact scientific method.\n \n I realize you haven't had all of this in formal education, so please ask questions if any point seems to not make sense. It will no doubt be my rushed typing and/or poor choice of wording.\n \n -Mach",

You either do or don't - it's hard to work out as first you advocated that science was attempting to, or might one day answer the question, but of late you say that it's purely subjective, and therefore not for the realm of science, but philosophy (and you included psychology in this).\n Later on you become more belligerent, I believe, based on the fact you're still unable to prove your beliefs by the only criteria you see as proof; your beliefs. It shows an odd thing that you make statements and can't prove them by what you deem 'proof'. Simply put, you've been caught out.\n \nThen for you, or your posturing about 'love' being found by science is now reversed?

My definition of love, the what..3 I've given you so far? Are all verifiable and have sufficient evidence to warrant belief. I can only ASSUME you had some definition of love that was NOT verifiable.\n\n I have a definition of love that's not verifiable by science. That's different from not being verified. Yes you've given various attempts at giving a definition; one of which was based on personal experience; everyone experiences it, therefore it's real - that's not science. A second definition was based on a web-site where people were saying that they were looking for it. I don't know what the third one is, unless that's the one where science can't look for it, but philosophers can (see above).\n \n2. You let us know that your definition is either love is god, or love cannot be without god. Both of which, for this argument, are good enough to debate.\n\n I told you\n a) God is love\n and\n b) there's no point going any further because you say you only accept what is verifiable anyway, (except love), and you keep this mantra up; as well as anyone who believes in God is irrational. I'm trying to get you to either admit there's no science of love; in which case you DO accept things beyond science's realm, or that science has come up with a test/definition of love; which you've yet to post.\n Once you accept either position, then we can proceed from there, but as stated, you've shifted your stance on love from being adamant that it exists - and posting some sites of scientists looking into it, to more recent ones where it's just philosophy.\n \n3. Yes, we all know, and we don't need to repeat it here (or do we?) that things that have no evidence are not rational to believe in, and are not knowable through any means, including...yes, science. So by your choice of definitions of love (love = god), it's by definition supported by a dogma as premise, and it doesn't need science or sufficient evidence to make it's claims. Your confusion confuses me.\n\n I am confused as to which stance you're willing to take. Your stance on science too, I'm still waiting for you to prove, by science. You haven't even attempted that one.\n \nNot entirely true. Religion is also based on observation. I have mentioned witnesses to miracles, people speak with God etc.\n\n \nMontalban, bigfoot is based on a few witnesses, so is the loch ness monster. So is the Easter bunny, I'm sure there are a few poor souls out there who have \"seen\" the Easter bunny.\n\n That's you again that only irrational people believe in things, therefore all things people witness are irrational. Let's just talk then about the science of Vulcanism or the geosynclinal theory, or eugenics, or phrenology. That is what you're trying to do, show one thing know to be not proven and lump all things in with that. SO, by your rational as scientists once put forward several theories that are now wrong; they're all wrong.\n \nSo you get to make a choice Montalban. You can either accept ANY AND ALL fantasy-land as rational, worthy of belief, and worthy of scientific support (not even investigation, you want dogmatic belief), or you can accept that for science to consider it \"known\", or \"knowable\", or \"rational\", or \"reasonable to believe in\", requires that it exist in the physical universe, and requires sufficient evidence.\n\n Again, that's the silliness of your argument. I don't believe in ANY AND ALL fantasy-land beliefs. It is based on the appallingly arrogant notion of yours; much repeated, that belief in religion is irrational.\n \nWhich is it going be Montalban(?) Shall we change the foundations of reason, logic, science, etc., to allow in trolls and bigfoot and witchcraft and boogeymen and psychics, just because you find certain specifics in science are troublesome since they don't agree with your brand of religious dogma? That's a yes or no question.\n\n It's a silly question. It's akin that you must accept all science as science. Recall you couldn't understand this, and I pointed out that Nazis conducted quite scientific experiments (go back to the Science and Math thread). You admitted you reject it (on non-scientific grounds). Why? Shouldn't I now put that you must accept ANY AND ALL scientific theory? That's a yes or no question! Again this is a chink in your armour. Sorry to point these out :)\n \nProve this, using science. If you can't, then your belief is actually philosophy or dogma!\n\n \nBurden of proof is on you buddy, you know that right? These are categorizations, and don't require \"proof through science\" though, just basic English language skills with a smattering of common sense.\n\n No, the burden of proofs on you. You have stated what you believe science is, and all you need to do is prove it using science. You can't because it's a philosophy. I've already given you several theories of science that are also philosophies of science - which you reject because they don't fit your category of science, which you can't prove is science and not just another category. It's called circular reasoning; and you live by it.\n You've been asked now for about 2 weeks or more to prove your claim and you've not been able to, and now you call me come up with proof.\n Further as to 'common sense' you differentiate below between what is rational and what is irrational. Now again because of your confusion of definitions that you give we must conclude that common sense is irrational, as it's not backed up by scientific proof.\n \nMathematics is by definition a science, look it up.\n\n Yes, I know it is. I've already mentioned most recently that I debated SLP over this, he took the side that it isn't... but concentrated on the word 'maths' which is Australian English for what you call math.\n \n\"Science\" : A broad term in this case I'm using it to encompass life sciences, cosmology, geology, etc., I'm sure you can fill in the rest.\n Psychology: Partially based in science, while parts extend beyond or current ability to provide evidence for or against.\n Philosophy: Depending on your philosophy, some require evidence by definition, some do not, and some we do not and possible cannot know if evidence for or against can be found.\n\n Yes, and you don't require evidence from science that your view of science is in fact all that science is, therefore it's a philosophy of science.\n \nFinally, your favorite, DOGMA. \n \"a religious doctrine that is proclaimed as true without proof \"\n There's your dead ringer!\n\n It's also a filmic style, and the name of a film. But I used it to describe certain people's beliefs on your side of the fence for a dogged determination to believe without facts - hence your belief in your version of science is science, and have yet to prove it; and now you want me to prove it.\n \nSo to summarize with those in mind:\n Mathematics: To prove something in mathematics requires formal proof in logic (in math's logical language).\n\n Where does Godel's Theorum work into this?\n \nThe more general \"Science\", such as physics, life science, etc.:\n It's understood that all science can theoretically be proven by mathematics,\n\n Really? How do you prove a cold by maths? (even in theory?) I'm not saying that you can't but I'd be interested to know.\n \nbut mathematics has not progressed to that level yet. So science accepts verifiable, repeatable evidence, using the various methods of science. Since it is not generally fully supported through mathematics, science progresses, and often corrects it's conclusions based on newer evidence, or evidence that previous theories are shown to be testable as false.\n Philosophy: Those areas requiring rational analysis/logic, etc. to arrive at beliefs, are by definition beliefs that require rational analysis, logic, etc. However, philosophy also encompasses those things NOT requiring evidence..i.e. metaphysics, among other fields. So, some of philosophy requires sufficient evidence, some does not, by definition.\n Saving the best for last, your personal favourite (I'm guess here on it being your favourite)....\n DOGMA!!\n \"DOGMA: a religious doctrine that is proclaimed as true without proof \"\n Did I read that right?

A while ago you attempted to show science in the concept of love. Now you've given up. However, do you now suggest love does, or doesn't exist? It's quite easy - 'yes' or 'no'. If 'yes' then you accept something exists without scientific proof. \n\n \nSwitch? You call logical steps a \"switch\"? You believe love = god, god does not require proof, therefore it's by definition a dogma, and by definition NOT something that science can rationalize. That's according to your definition of love. I'd appreciate if you concede on that point, it's over, right?\n\n The positions are mutually exclusive; that science can test for love, that science can't. You've moved from one to the other.\n How is that analogous to me believing in God before, to me believing in God now? There is no switch there.\n \nWhat we've seen is you take unreasonable positions on maths and drinking - assigning as by analogy - irrational behaviour to those who are religious - and then arguing against that! \n\n \nI'm stunned that you can think this.\n I say again, THEY ARE THE SAME THING, IT'S A SIMPLE LOGICAL ANALOGY:\n\n No, it's not.

Is BETTY-SUE making a rational conclusion, or an irrational conclusion, based on the evidence that no egg has ever been witnessed to lay golden eggs, and that there is no reasons to suspect any chicken has the plumbing to form and squeeze out a hunk of pure Au, and that the only evidence she has his her immature brother's verbal claim, a brother who has been known to be incorrect about his claims in the past. \n Check one:\n A. Rational\n B. Irrational\n You think I'm using strawman? It's LOGIC 101.\n\n No, it's not logic. It's based on your a priori notions with regards to what is rational, and it's based on the notion that all ideas not based on science are invalid. And then you argue from that axiom; which is false. There are many centuries of great minds that have come to believe in God, from great thinkers such as St. Augustine of Hippo, and St. Thoms Aquinas down to our own era. They did have reason behind their belief.\n \nReplace chicken/egg with God, you know, substitute the variable, and you'll do fine with it, trust me.\n\n As stated, it is the absolute paramount of arrogance to suggest that people who believe in God are irrational. That is why you're having trouble with where to stand with regards 'love'. You want there to be science to back up your beliefs that love exists, but you can't find any, and as you only believe what is backed by science, you're now moving to a belief that love only exists in a 'philosophical' sense. And yet the irony is, if you believe in love in only a philosophical sense then you are being irrational, by your own defintion. This is why it's an untenable position.\n \nNot at all. My religion says nothing about digital watches, stereo TVs, aeroplanes etc. I'm happy with science there.\n Further, you completely misrepresent me on this, as I've already posted a number of times the following\n \"Long ago (in the 4th century!) one of the Church's teachers Vasilius the Great wrote about this. He advised the Orthodox Christians neither to rely upon the scientific data in order to provide foundation for their faith in Christ, nor to try to disprove them, because \"the scientists permanently disprove themselves.\"\n http://www.pravoslavie.ru/english/age-of-earth.htm\n It is not the Orthodox way to tie our dogma to science, but hey, since you're about ignoring what I say, and prefer to argue what you'd like me to have said, so be it. Yes, if that were my position, but it's not. So, re-constructing the position of religious people into straw-man, arguing against that, and voila, you've got your version of debate.\n\n \nYour point is not only not progressing your side of the debate, it's taking you right back to irrationality.\n\n Why? Because you misrepresent my faith as you tried to do? Or that you develop an artificial notion of what is truth?\n \nThe only thing you seem to disagree with science on are those parts that do not accept your religious dogma. Of course you won't get far denying digital watches work, please DO take that stance and we can fly to Australia and force you to watch them work. However, since you've chosen only those scientific theories that have sufficient evidence, and choose to debate them with, of all things, a dogma, then I cannot see how you think your position is valid. Here's another analogy for you so it's easier to choke down:\n\n Here endeth my debate with you at present as you've just gone and repeated a misrepresentation of my faith. I just stated I don't have any problems with such things, and now you totally ignore that and pretend that I might. It is totally dishonest of you to do so. I wonder if that's rational?\n \n It is one thing to remain ignorant of the many great minds that exist outside your own circle; philosophers and theists, it is another to be so arrogant to say that they are all irrational, based on some weird idea about science, that you can't even prove anyway. It is in fact irrational of you to make such an argument (based on your own definition of rational). This is why you have now developed the tactic of misrepresenting my faith - to the point of suggesting I have problems with digital watches.\n \n That's several times you make illogical statements;\n One is on love, but you switch so often now, it's hard to know what your stance is\n Another is on what is rational; based on evidence; yet you accept speculation of science (without evidence) as science; so it's either rational or irrational, again it's hard to tell as you make several arguments at once...including that it is both science and science fiction. (I suggest you look 'fiction' up).\n Another, closely related, on only just emerging is that you base your beliefs in science as science on English langauge and 'common sesnse' which, also by your own definition is irrational. And from this strange position you base all other arguments on; what you think is science\n Further, I have no problem with people questioning my faith, but it's another thing for someone like yourself to simply repeat a misrepresentation of it, even after I've told you something. I think that you are stooping to doing that because your argument has become devoid of any reason - you have (by your own definition) yet to provide a reason why you believe science is as you say it is.\n \n To others interested in knowing...\n Science\n Main Entry: sci\u00b7ence \n Pronunciation: 'sI-&n(t)s\n Function: noun\n Etymology: Middle English, from Middle French, from Latin scientia, from scient-, sciens having knowledge, from present participle of scire to know; probably akin to Sanskrit chyati he cuts off, Latin scindere to split -- more at SHED\n 1 : the state of knowing : knowledge as distinguished from ignorance or misunderstanding\n 2 a : a department of systematized knowledge as an object of study <the science of theology< b : something (as a sport or technique) that may be studied or learned like systematized knowledge <have it down to a science<\n 3 a : knowledge or a system of knowledge covering general truths or the operation of general laws especially as obtained and tested through scientific method b : such knowledge or such a system of knowledge concerned with the physical world and its phenomena : NATURAL SCIENCE\n 4 : a system or method reconciling practical ends with scientific laws <culinary science<\n http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=science&x=0&y=0\n \n sci\u00b7ence P Pronunciation Key (sns)\n n. \n The observation, identification, description, experimental investigation, and theoretical explanation of phenomena.\n Such activities restricted to a class of natural phenomena.\n Such activities applied to an object of inquiry or study.\n Methodological activity, discipline, or study: I've got packing a suitcase down to a science. \n An activity that appears to require study and method: the science of purchasing. \n Knowledge, especially that gained through experience.\n \n Observation and description are what people have done when they saw God and saw His miracles.\n Catholics believe that you can have proof of God (http://www.newadvent.org/summa/100203.htm).

   "Hi, I tried to sift through most of the arguments on this topic, but I really only have a few questions to ask those who believe evidence is not required in what we might consider to be \"science\":\n\n I for one am not against 'evidence' per se. However several posters such as Mach are against the evidence ID might present based not on the validity of the evidence, but because it doesn't fit within their philosophical frame-work, which I believe is an un-scientific notion - if science really is about seeking answers.\n ID theorists don't propose that 'God did it', though that is a possibility. They are prepared to keep an open-mind regardless of what the evidence might point to. And several believe that the evidence suggests order - like laws of biology.\n Mach, et al discount it simply because they've already discounted God, and he discounts God because there's 'no evidence' based on a philosophy of science that wouldn't account for God anyway. Circular reasoning. And it is a philosophy, one of many, because his statement on science is not proven by science, but by philosophical arguments.... such as \"it's common sense\" which not being science, is by his own definition, irrational.... ah, irony.\n \nIt's perfectly acceptable to believe that creationism or ID is what guides the course of the fields that evolution tries to explain, unfortunately it denies science access to more esoteric areas that evolutionary theory guides to, such as genetics.

The materialist-evidence-only science as put forward by persons such as Mach would fail to account for this, if it were true. That is the problem with such a philosophy of science - it has established frameworks that the answer might lie outside of. What you seem to propose is \"let's not accept it because the answers (if they are there in the ID-framework) might be too difficult to deal with in a practical way.\"\n It seems to be, \"Let's not consider it as a possibility, because of other implications\"",

   "It's no problem for me, because I accept that it exists without scientific proof. You either do or don't - it's hard to work out as first you advocated that science was attempting to, or might one day answer the question, but of late you say that it's purely subjective, and therefore not for the realm of science, but philosophy (and you included psychology in this).\n\n \n So why argue anything? I can make up a billion fictional ideas and your belief system can accept everyone of them because \"you don't need proof\". Just a few examples of historical danger from this sort of \"belief\" system, that reuqires no proof:\n \n Example of Montalban's belief system IN ACTION\n A: That girl's a witch, she made me have lustful feeling for her.\n B: OK, let's burn her.\n A: Wait, don't we need to prove she's a witch?\n B: Heck no, we don't NEED sufficient evidence, just faith that she's a witch\n \n How about<b></b>:\n A: Take this drug, it will cure your cancer\n B: Really? How will I know it works.\n A: Well, you don't need to \"know\", you just need to \"accept\" as truth without evidence.\n B: OK, cool, here's $20,000, thanks. *pops sugar pill*, dies the next day.\n \n Or maybe:\n A: This child car seat is perfectly safe\n B: Wow, neato. But do you have any test results or evidence that it's safe?\n A: No, you don't need evidence, you just need faith.\n B: OK, I have faith in this car seat!! Thanks!\n \n See how your belief system is \"different\" than one that requires evidence? I will start by stating (although I'm writing this sentence 1/2 way through), that you seem to misunderstand some important fundamentals about science and what it represents. Which may not be surprising if you insist you're rational, yet \"disagree\" with the process of science.\n \n \n\n Later on you become more belligerent, I believe, based on the fact you're still unable to prove your beliefs by the only criteria you see as proof; your beliefs. It shows an odd thing that you make statements and can't prove them by what you deem 'proof'. Simply put, you've been caught out.\n\n \n I'm not belligerent, I'm showing you the absurdity of the position you are defending.\n \n \nI have a definition of love that's not verifiable by science. That's different from not being verified. Yes you've given various attempts at giving a definition; one of which was based on personal experience; everyone experiences it, therefore it's real - that's not science. A second definition was based on a web-site where people were saying that they were looking for it. I don't know what the third one is, unless that's the one where science can't look for it, but philosophers can (see above).\n \n I told you\n a) God is love\n and\n b) there's no point going any further because you say you only accept what is verifiable anyway, (except love), and you keep this mantra up; as well as anyone who believes in God is irrational. I'm trying to get you to either admit there's no science of love; in which case you DO accept things beyond science's realm, or that science has come up with a test/definition of love; which you've yet to post.\n Once you accept either position, then we can proceed from there, but as stated, you've shifted your stance on love from being adamant that it exists - and posting some sites of scientists looking into it, to more recent ones where it's just philosophy.\n I am confused as to which stance you're willing to take. Your stance on science too, I'm still waiting for you to prove, by science. You haven't even attempted that one.\n\n \n So, your definition of love, let's repeat it since it's consistent with your other beliefs:\n Love = god.\n By definition, you require no evidence (see car seat, witch burning, sugar pill that cures cancer).\n \n My definition:\n \"Get pleasure from\"\n Easily testable by any english speakng human with sufficient IQ to conduct a methodical test.\n \n Yes, if you combine both definitions in the term \"love\", it's not consistent. But only if you want to argue with a strawman does one do that (you did that). You need to, in this case, define the different versions of love, and test each vs science.\n \n love = god\n OK, based on dogma, which requires no evidence to take as true. Science cannot prove or disprove this by definition.\n \n love = 1 particular chemical that brings that \"feeling\" of euphoric love.\n Science can measure this all day long, can be \"proven\" by science that it occurs.\n \n I know it's much more clear now, that addresses specifically your confusion on that issue.\n \n \nThat's you again that only irrational people believe in things, therefore all things people witness are irrational. Let's just talk then about the science of Vulcanism or the geosynclinal theory, or eugenics, or phrenology. That is what you're trying to do, show one thing know to be not proven and lump all things in with that. SO, by your rational as scientists once put forward several theories that are now wrong; they're all wrong.\n\n Oh no, we don't believe science because it's science you...oh slippery montalban...we believe in science because of the rational methods and because of the sufficient evidence. How can you not understand the difference exactly?\n \n Example:\n Scientific theory:\n \n Superstring theory: Insufficient evidence. Parsimony does not seem to apply here.\n Theory of general relativity: Hey, we know that one, and so far it's been tested numerous times on many levels, and is supported by all available evidence.\n \n You don't have to accept all of science, not every theory has sufficient evidence. You made up a strawman because you simply do not understand the basic concept. YOU DO NOT have to accept all things claimed in the name of science, science isn't some dogma, it's a process, a method. You don't have to agree with ALL scientific results, but you MUST accept the methodoloy, or reject it. You MUST. If you have specific objections to the methods of science, PLEASE tell us and we can help you with them.\n \n \nAgain, that's the silliness of your argument. I don't believe in ANY AND ALL fantasy-land beliefs. It is based on the appallingly arrogant notion of yours; much repeated, that belief in religion is irrational.\n\n Do not call me arrogant again please, I actively strive to be devoid of ego. Being correct MUST be seperated from ego if you're going to get anywhere with rational thought.\n \n You by definition, accept things without evidence. Of course you MUST accept any and all. Otherwise, you need to revise your belief system.\n \n You choose:\n Montalban: I believe without sufficient evidence\n Mach: I believe only with sufficient evidence\n \n My position requires me to accept things I don't want to believe in, if they have sufficient evidence. You can believe whatever you want, beacuse you require no evidence.\n \n I say again, I regularly have to believe in things that I might not want to accept, based on my rational belief system (through reasoning, logic, sufficient evidence). That's why science, the application of this in the pursuit of knowledge, irks you, it's requiring you to believe something that your dogma, that doesn't require evidence, if you adhere to the methods of science. It forces you to choose...or rebel and retreat into an irrational belief system. Give those crutches up and walk tall amongst your fellow humans!\n \n \nIt's a silly question. It's akin that you must accept all science as science. Recall you couldn't understand this, and I pointed out that Nazis conducted quite scientific experiments (go back to the Science and Math thread). You admitted you reject it (on non-scientific grounds). Why? Shouldn't I now put that you must accept ANY AND ALL scientific theory? That's a yes or no question! Again this is a chink in your armour. Sorry to point these out :)\n\n \n Read above. You either accept without evidence, or with evidence. with science, there are PLENTY of theories that do not have sufficient evidence, no one claims you must beilieve them. You are attacking a strawman, and not understanding at the same time.\n \n \nReally? How do you prove a cold by maths? (even in theory?) I'm not saying that you can't but I'd be interested to know.\n\n \n My argument doesn't rely on this, and it's a good question, but for a new thread. In general, the interaction between matter and energy can be modeled. A virus is just a group of various atoms (very complex to us, but relatively simple compared to living organisms) that interacts with the physical world based on...you guessed it, natural laws, laws we try to describe in physics. There is nothing that suggest with enough time, computing power, and enough application of reason, we could not model anything in the physical world, other than perhaps things that require the modeler to model itself, etc.\n \n However, quantum mechanics might require a different approach once we get to really small things:\n \n \nWe do not know if this indeterminism is actually the way the Universe works because the theory of Quantum Mechanics is probably incomplete. That is, we do not know if the Universe actually behaves in a probabilistic manner (there are many possible paths a particle can follow and the observed path is chosen probabilistically) or if the Universe is deterministic in the sense that I can predict the path a particle will follow with 100 % certainty\n. \n \n So if you want to \"teach the controversy\", my humble suggestion to you is read up on QM, and hide your religion there. However, it is thought that QM theory is incomplete, you might need to find a new residence once it is complete.\n \n \nWould you mind providing where you got your definitions from?\n dog\u00b7ma P Pronunciation Key (d\u00f4gm, dg-)\n n. pl. dog\u00b7mas or dog\u00b7ma\u00b7ta (-m-t) \n A doctrine or a corpus of doctrines relating to matters such as morality and faith, set forth in an authoritative manner by a church.\n An authoritative principle, belief, or statement of ideas or opinion, especially one considered to be absolutely true.

If the former, then you are doing what would be considered reasonable, and therefore rational. I know this is difficult to come to grips with as you have this odd idea that only your side of the debate is rational.\n\n \n You can believe whatever you like, of course. But if it's not based on sufficient evidence, I question your belief methodology, and call it \"not based on reason\", or, irrational. \n \n Your example:\n \nGood judgment can be based on past experience, trusting those who tell you. Irrational means to be without this\n\n \n Reall read this carefully, it's somewhat abstract:\n - \"Good judgement\", let's assume good judgement means \"a rational conclusion\" to keep our terms consistent.\n \n - \"Based on past experience:\"\n If your interperation of past experience is fairly accurate, this is just \"testing\". Evidence gathered from tests. This is good!\n \n - \"Trusting those who tell you\"\n This get's interesting. What is your method of determining trust? If it's \"they are my friend\", that's got a low probablity of being correct I would say. If it's \"they have always made rational conclusions in the past, and I can concieve of no probably motivation for them to decieve me\", then you have useful evidence in their statement. They would also need to be capable of giving you an opinion on the matter based on reason, that is, you would not ask a native from a primitivie culture to give you evidence for quantum mechanics. I absolutely agree! So you are believing based on sufficient evidence, assuming the answer you are looking for is of only moderate importance.\n \n So no, this would be entirely rational, and to some degree, science, at least enough for a good hypothesis. You're exactly right, we do this EVERY DAY, and it's roots are in rational observation, and it gives rise to the scientific method! You are a scientist and didn't even know it!! ;)\n \n Here is the difference in what you are trying to claim as rational:\n Given your \"good judgement example\", let's say it's your friend's familiy who told you the store was on the EAST side of the highway. You have also been to this store, and clearly recall it's on the EAST side of the highway.\n \n HOWEVER: You run into Nablatnom, a complete stranger, who tells you, that without a doubt, the store is on the WEST side of the highway, without your even asking the question.\n \n Now is your test:\n Do you believe in those that you feel were capable of making the right observaton, family friends who are capable of basic navigation you know, and in your own past experience of having actually been there....that the store in on the EAST side\n \n OR\n \n Do you believe, despite Sufficient evidence, that the store is on the WEST side.\n \n Of course you believe its on the east if you are rational, and take notice. You probably ARE perfectly OK with rational beliefs, however, you hold onto one specific irrational belief, for selfish reasons. Please see that the entire method of science, and reason in general, is based on fundamentals like the above, just done many many times over and over, until at some point, the common man (like us) cannot just read two sentences and understand their chain of rational decisions. We have to research it, and come to our own conclusions...but always, always, always, based on sufficient evidence.\n \n \n \nThe positions are mutually exclusive; that science can test for love, that science can't. You've moved from one to the other.\n How is that analogous to me believing in God before, to me believing in God now? There is no switch there.\n\n \n No, it's not. (see above I explain this). \n \n \nNo, it's not logic. It's based on your a priori notions with regards to what is rational, and it's based on the notion that all ideas not based on science are invalid. And then you argue from that axiom; which is false. There are many centuries of great minds that have come to believe in God, from great thinkers such as St. Augustine of Hippo, and St. Thoms Aquinas down to our own era. They did have reason behind their belief.\n\n \n You believe in the same notion of what's rational, you just don't know it yet, or just have agreed in reading the above test of yours.\n \n \nAs stated, it is the absolute paramount of arrogance to suggest that people who believe in God are irrational. That is why you're having trouble with where to stand with regards 'love'. You want there to be science to back up your beliefs that love exists, but you can't find any, and as you only believe what is backed by science, you're now moving to a belief that love only exists in a 'philosophical' sense. And yet the irony is, if you believe in love in only a philosophical sense then you are being irrational, by your own defintion. This is why it's an untenable position.\n\n \n And it's your absolute misunderstanding of your position that makes you assume me spending hours and hours of my time trying to explain something to both you and anonymous people in a fairly verbose and fairly unemotional way is somehow arrogance and not any number of other things (kindness, passion, reason, entertainment, compassion, pity, etc., etc., etc. or any combination)\n \n \nIt is one thing to remain ignorant of the many great minds that exist outside your own circle; philosophers and theists, it is another to be so arrogant to say that they are all irrational, based on some weird idea about science, that you can't even prove anyway. It is in fact irrational of you to make such an argument (based on your own definition of rational). This is why you have now developed the tactic of misrepresenting my faith - to the point of suggesting I have problems with digital watches.\n\n \n You obviously have issues with something, but what I cannot figure out. I have stated over and over that you only have issues with rational conclusions that disagree with your dogma that requires no belief. Namely, the creation of humans in this case (looks at the title of the forum). Oh yes, we're in the right place.\n \n \n \nThat's several times you make illogical statements;\n One is on love, but you switch so often now, it's hard to know what your stance is\n\n Sorry, I've already shown you your error on the love issue. I make no error with regards to it, certainly not in the general argument.\n \n \n You end the debate you forfeit, either way I hope you read through this and continue.\n \n -Mach",

You know science can't test for things such as love.\n \n and how specifically you would change the limitations of science to allow for your sorts of pursuits?\n\n I would not be so arrogant as to put this in terms of 'how I would change science's. I simply put forward the ideas of some scientists that look for ID.\n \nThis is your first post, the first I rejected, and after pages and pages I still don't have these basic response from you. That is, if you'd like to support your original statements. \n -Mach\n\n You often make the claim I've not answered you, and yet you respond to my posts which contain the answer. More evidence that you quickly rush through the post to answer what you already believe I am going to say, rather than what I actually say.\n \n I persevere never-the-less because I have a great store of patience. But even that is beginning to ebb. You have continually made claims as to what you think I said, and generally they are only slight difference of emphasis that you miss.",

   "Montalban, I must interject that that is the stupidest attempt to refute reason I've ever seen.\n\n \n And of course he is actually attempting to argue against himself. His original beleif statement is along the lines that science is the only real test for certainty, because it's based on evidence. There's no scientific evidence for God, for example, therefore there is no God.\n \n I proposed evidences outside science, such as eye-witnesses, which he rejected out-of-hand due their the nature of that evidence; being non-scientific.\n \n I questioned him about 'does love exist?' and he tried at first to show that science has shown love exists. This failed, and he switched to giving philosophical proofs.\n \n Now he says that there are some things we can be certain of that exist outside the realm of science (though he used maths/math-like arguments to prove this). Had he done so, then he'd have argued against his position on knowledge needing to be based on evidence (by which he means scientific evidence). That is, he is attempting here to argue against one of this own over-arching beliefs.",

You try to bend words to your favor. I know of no other scientific evidence other than evidence based on the physical world. But that begs the question:\n \n 1. What scientific evidence, as you imply, can lead to a non-materialistic outcome? Please do share this with us. First things first.\n \n 2. What sort of \"stuff\" might ID theorists come up with, that isn't based on the physical universe? I'm curious, please do share.\n \n 3. How could \"stuff\" point to god, when we cannot define god, nor do we have evidence to support belief in a god? What would we be looking for?

You know science can't test for things such as love.\n\n Well, you're wrong, and I've already been through this.\n As we've established, my defintion of love is most certainly testable.\n \n \n I simply put forward the ideas of some scientists that look for ID\n\n \n How do you propose to debate when you need no evidence for your beliefs?

   "As I understand it Dembski uses information theory to state that evolution is impossible. Even if the conclusion is wrong he did make an effort to model things mathematically and if you prove it wrong you still learn something. I don't think most people can comment on how true or false Demskis claims are since information theory has the highly techinal and specific definition of information is based on sum of the probabilities of the events * log base (probability). \n \n IHowever do Demskis claims \"point to God\" and do they explain the fossil record as well as evolution?",
