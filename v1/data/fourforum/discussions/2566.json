You must believe that only people of European heritage can be racists (members of other ethnic groups are only \"proud of their heritages\", not racist).\n \n [If you don't, you're a racist]\n \n 6. You must believe that all races contributed equally (and continue to contribute equally) to the formation of the United States of America.\n \n [If you don't, you're a racist]\n \n 7. You must believe that Blacks, in particular, contributed more to American society and progress than what any history book reflects.\n \n [If you don't, you're a racist]\n \n 8.

You must never make the claim that an American-made rocket engine is \"superior\" in any way to an African clay pot or a Jamaican voodoo doll under any circumstances, scientific or otherwise.

Not only did the UKIP do extremely well, but so did the British National Party:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=3148\n \n In any case, I think the posters (in this thread, at least) need to wake up and get their heads out of those rose-colored clouds. For example, Sglaine wrote, \"We as whole need to figure out way's to get along with others.\" Obviously Sglaine has never studied the history of humans on this planet.\n \n My post was an expos\u00e9 of the prevalent attitude of our society that is forced on the ignorant masses by the mass new and entertainment media and the schools. This attitude does not allow dissent to the notion that multiracial societies are the most virtuous societies that humans can live in. I oppose that belief wholeheartedly not only because it is demonstratably false, but because it demoralizes White people, who are taught clandestinely that they are the ones who are responsible for \"racism\" and the \"oppression\" of other races.\n \n Sglaine also wrote, \"I can see how this thread could cause hate.\"\n \n \"Hate\" is one of those en vogue buzzwords designed to stifle debate. Similar terms are \"bigot\", \"intolerant\", and \"prejudiced\". Such words are designed to provoke an emotional response and get the focus off facts and rational thinking.",

We never had the term \"racism\" or \"racist\" before Charles Darwin's book:\n \n \"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life\"\n \n We often time don't consider is what the geopolitics of the day was... at the time this language developed into how we [think] we use it today - bigotry has always existed in man, and men were plainly known as bigots. But During the Victorian era, we saw the increase of the industrialization of nations equipped to do so, and along with immense wealth come the temptation to become bombastic, pompous and elitist... and that is what Darwin's references were. See... the social elite of the day saw anyone other than Anglo as flatly inferior, that is why and when we saw the birth of scientism... or what it is plainly known as \"science\" that justifies my world view - to which Charles Darwin having been a chief proponent of. Now we see after this writing a more vitriolic out pouring of views that that one's race did in fact make capable or incapable, rational or irrational... civil or uncivil... all of it hinged on Darwin's baseless assertions.\n \n Nietzsche was influence by them... Marx was influenced by them... Hitler, Mao and Stalin as well could not have had the successes they did unless there was ground work and Darwin laid that pretty well. The end assertion is that because of your race you are incapable or may be a hereditary or genetic flaw inherent in the race, and when they meant race... they meant sub-species or genus. They tried to write you right out of humanity. This made for ridiculous laws that considered Blacks in American 3/5's human... and silliness like that. All in the end were laid waste by common sense, when I came to this reality - I changed my language to suit the reality of what was being alleged. I don't' use the term race or racism in my arguments in engaged in one on the topic, I use what it plainly is - bigotry.

For example, Sglaine wrote, \"We as whole need to figure out way's to get along with others.\" Obviously Sglaine has never studied the history of humans on this planet.\n \n My post was an expos\u00e9 of the prevalent attitude of our society that is forced on the ignorant masses by the mass new and entertainment media and the schools. This attitude does not allow dissent to the notion that multiracial societies are the most virtuous societies that humans can live in. I oppose that belief wholeheartedly not only because it is demonstratably false, but because it demoralizes White people, who are taught clandestinely that they are the ones who are responsible for \"racism\" and the \"oppression\" of other races.\n \n Sglaine also wrote, \"I can see how this thread could cause hate.\"\n \n \"Hate\" is one of those en vogue buzzwords designed to stifle debate.

You must believe that only people of European heritage can be racists (members of other ethnic groups are only \"proud of their heritages\", not racist).\n \n [If you don't, you're a racist] Wrong! Weither black, white, asian, mixed you are allowed to be proud of who you are. So if an Asian makes fun of white people - does that mean they are proud of their herritage? Sorry but this one makes no sense.\n \n 6. You must believe that all races contributed equally (and continue to contribute equally) to the formation of the United States of America.\n \n [If you don't, you're a racist] Correct!\n \n 7.

You must assert, if necessary, that rap \"music\" is at least the creative equal of the entire works of Beethoven, Brahms, and Wagner.\n \n [If you don't, you're a racist]Wrong! I'm not really a fan of rap, I'm more into pop music weither it be sung by a white perosn or a black person. Beyonce rules! Does this mean that if I'm not into rap, that I'm suddenly racist?\n \n 16.

Why must anyone be silent about any murder reguardless of race?! What ever race killed what race does not matter to me, the reason doesn't even matter, but the fact that they murder does matter.\n \n 18. You must temporarily accept the fact that a white man was the first to walk upon the moon---until black revisionists have had time to rewrite that unpalatable truth. Afterward, you must then support their new historical version, without question.\n \n [If you don't, you're a racist]Wrong! OK this is getting ridiculous now.

You must believe that Blacks and Latinos have a permanent claim on white society -- a claim that demands that Whites provide them with an endless stream of jobs that their skills did not merit, with favored entrance into top universities that their sub-standard test scores did not earn, and, most of all, with a growing voice in the future of this nation that their inferior culture, moral values, and nominal contributions to society do not justify.\n \n [If you don't, you're a racist]Wrong! I think only the ones (weither it be black, white, asian, mixed) who have studied hard for the scholarships should have top priority! Not just because of race.\n \n 20. And, finally, you must believe that the world would be better off without \"racist\" white people, their racist culture, science, technology, art, music, medicine, and philosophy.\n \n [If you don't, you're a racist]Wrong! You should say \"The world would be better off with out racist people and culture all together. Does it also make me racist to like artists who are white? White technology and science?

And the more brutal the attack, the more silent you must be.\n \n [If you don't, you're a racist]\n \n 18. You must temporarily accept the fact that a white man was the first to walk upon the moon---until black revisionists have had time to rewrite that unpalatable truth. Afterward, you must then support their new historical version, without question.\n \n [If you don't, you're a racist]\n \n 19. You must believe that Blacks and Latinos have a permanent claim on white society -- a claim that demands that Whites provide them with an endless stream of jobs that their skills did not merit, with favored entrance into top universities that their sub-standard test scores did not earn, and, most of all, with a growing voice in the future of this nation that their inferior culture, moral values, and nominal contributions to society do not justify. \n \n [If you don't, you're a racist]\n \n 20. And, finally, you must believe that the world would be better off without \"racist\" white people, their racist culture, science, technology, art, music, medicine, and philosophy.\n \n [If you don't, you're a racist]\n\n \n Yep.
