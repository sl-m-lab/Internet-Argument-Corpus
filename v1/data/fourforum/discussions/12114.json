   "what's a species, scientifically? Can any evo here define that?\nSure. The various species concepts are just efforts to define observed differences between closely related populations. Mayr's definition is the most common and widely taught at lower levels of study because it is easily understood. Mayr said that species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups. Dobzhansky said essentially the same thing. He said that a species is a group of individuals fully fertile inter se, but barred from interbreeding with other similar groups by its physiological properties.\n \n Mayr's definition is called the Biological Species Concept. Other biologists, depending on their particular field, have offered other definitions. For example:\n \n Evolutionary Species Concept A species is a single lineage of populations or organisms that maintains its identity from other such lineages and which has its own evolutionary tendencies and historical fate.\n \n Phylogenetic Species Concept A phylogenetic species is an irreducible cluster of organisms that is diagnosably distinct from other such clusters, and within which there is a parental pattern of ancestry and descent. This could also be express as: A species is the smallest monophyletic group of common ancestry.\n \n Recognition Species Concept A species is the most inclusive population of individual biparental organisms that share a common fertilization system.\n \n Cohesion Species Concept A species is the most inclusive population of individuals having the potential for phenotypic cohesion through intrinsic cohesion mechanisms.\n \n Ecological Species Concept A species is a lineage that occupies an adaptive zone minimally different from that of any other lineage in its range and which evolves separately from all lineages outside its range.\n \n Internodal Species Concept Individual organisms are conspecific by virtue of their common membership in a part of the genealogical network between two permanent splitting events or between a permanent split and an extinction event.\n \n Hope that helps.",

   "so why do they call polar bears and brown bears different \"species\" when they can breed and produce fertile offspring together?\nBecause, when each is in its natural habitat, they are reproductively isolated.\n \nSame with different varieties of finches.\nSorry, that is incorrect. Interbreeding has been observed between only three species of Darwin's finches. All three are in the genus Geospiza. Interbreeding has not been observed between any of the other 11 species in any of the three genra. This is in spite of the fact that the genus Camarhynchus has been diversified (6 species) for about as long as the Geospiza (6 species). One species, G. fortis (medium ground finch), was observed to interbreed with two other species, G. scandens (common cactus finch) and G. fulginosa (small ground finch). Even among these species interbreeding is extremely rare. Interbreeding between other more closely related species doesn't happen because of the geographical distribution. They are reproductively isolated because they live on different islands.\n \n I think that you are mischaracterizing the facts in an effort to mislead. You have to save your version of mythology somehow.\n \nIt seems to me that evos don't at all go on the ability to breed or produce viable offspring, but instead just on mere looks....otherwise, why would they have made such obvious mistakes with the bears and finches, not to mention countless others?\nThat's what it seems to you? So lions and tigers are the same species too? Actually, if you understood the basics of biology you would know that interbreeding between closely related species is not uncommon. It is known as hybridization.\n \n I wonder if Big Science would consider black people different \"species\" than say Asian people or white people -- they look different, which is their main criteria....so why not?\nThat view actually came from christians, not from scientists. It is obvious that humans are not reproductively isolated. Since classification into species isn't actually based on appearance as you erroeously claim, the answer is no, science wouldn't consider them separate species.\n \nAs a creationist, I can very comfortably say that all humans are of the same kind.\nThat's one of the changes that has been observed in christians.

First you argued that \"evolutionists\" decided on species by appearance, and now you are arguing that \"evolutionists\" decide by ability to interbreed. Pick a horse and ride it. It makes you look foolish when you flop around so.\n \n As for your out of context quotes of Grant from that creationist site, they are meaningless. Of course, if the absolute ability to interbreed were the only thing that determined species, then there would be fewer species of Darwin's finches. However, most of the various species of finch do not interbreed at all with other species. Those that have been observed to do so, did so under very rare circumstances. Moreover, they were closely related, as determined from a number of different means, one being DNA comparisons. As I mentioned, the species of the genus Camarhynchus are presumed to have the ability to interbreed to some extent since they are closely related. However, they are reproductively isolated by their environments and geography.\n \n By the way, Darwin didn't recognize that his collection of finches represented several species. That was the conclusionn of Sir Richard Owen KCB, Church of England Cleric, Surgeon, Naturalist, Creationist, founder of the British Museum of Natural History, and FRS (until expelled for claiming the work of others as his own). Darwin did think that the Galapagos turtles represented several species until that was shown to be incorrect.\n \n So one wonders. What is your point?",

It is actually the Brown bears of the ABC islands that have the closest genetic similarity to Polar bears. However, ABC bears look like all other Brown bears from the Pacific northwest of the US to Canada, as well as Asian and European Brown Bears. But Brown bears vary in size in various regions, the largest being the Kodiak bear. But Polar bears are larger than all of them.\n \n It isn't understood why the ABC island bears are most similar to Polar bears, since the ABC islands (Admiralty, Baranof, Chichagof) are part of the Alexander Archipelago in the south east part of Alaska, between British Columbia and the Pacific. They are separated from the range of Polar bears by the entire state of Alaska and northern Canada.\n \n It is interesting to note that the ability of Polar bears to interbreed with Brown bears was discovered by a zoo keeper (San Diego?). During renovations, the zoo keeper put Brown bears and Polar bears in the same enclosure. They had been in adjacent enclosures and rather than show aggression, they seemed quite friendly.

And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.\n \n Gen 1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.\n \n Gen 1:4 And God saw the light, that [it was] good: and God divided the light from the darkness.\n \n Gen 1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.

And the evening and the morning were the second day.\n \n Gen 1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry [land] appear: and it was so.\n \n Gen 1:10 And God called the dry [land] Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that [it was] good.\n \n Gen 1:11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, [and] the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed [is] in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.\n \n Gen 1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, [and] herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed [was] in itself, after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.\n \n Gen 1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.\n \n Gen 1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:\n \n Gen 1:15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.\n \n Gen 1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also.\n \n Gen 1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,\n \n Gen 1:18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that [it was] good.\n \n Gen 1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.\n \n Gen 1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl [that] may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.\n \n Gen 1:21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.\n \n Gen 1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.\n \n Gen 1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.\n \n Gen 1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.\n \n Gen 1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.\n \n Gen 1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\n \n Gen 1:27 So God created man in his [own] image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\n \n Gen 1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.\n \n Gen 1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which [is] upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which [is] the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.\n \n Gen 1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein [there is] life, [I have given] every green herb for meat: and it was so.\n \n Gen 1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, [it was] very good.

Instead, you try to ridicule pandion.\n\n \n I didn't explain it then because I couldn't believe such an insignificant error was being made an issue of and needed explaining. And I didn't ridicule pandion any more than he was attempting to ridicule me. Why are you completely blind to that aspect of his remark to me? Can you not see the hypocrisy in accusing me of ridiculing him as you completely ignore how childish his original criticism of me was for such a ridiculous issue of saying to scroll to the bottom of the page rather than only half way? That's beyond you isn't it tq. \n \n \nThis is just another example of how utterly incapable you are of admitting that you've made a mistake. Instead, when you your error is pointed out, you attack the one who pointed it out, just as you did with pandion.\n\n \n Wrong again tq. It was pandion who attempted to make me look stupid over an insignificant and meaningless error which was a waste of bandwidth to even mention. Especially since the post wasn't even directed at him directly but was as general information for all of the members discussing the issue of hybrids. Had admin corrected me, it would have actually been valid. But you know as well as I and everyone else on this forum that you and your cohorts are constantly looking for any miniscule error I make which you can attack me over. Even one as small as me saying to scroll to the bottom of the page rather than only half way. OOOH what do the TOS say about that infraction. I guess I'm lucky I wasn't banned, huh?\n \n \nCheck out your post in response to pandion to see who threw a childish tantrum. I merely pointed it out. But you're right, it is pretty embarassing to expect you to take responsibility for your behaviour.\n\n \n Sure thing. Here is Pandions criticism of my error, and my response to him.\n \n \n \n I looked at the bottom and found nothing. So I looked some more and found that the list of hybrid animals wasn't even half way down the page. Very nice.\n\n \n \nWhat you're saying is you scrolled right past the bolded yellow headline which said \"Examples of Hybrid Animals\" in search of another list lower down? very nice. \n \n\n \n Oh yeah, I threw a tantrum for sure. Or did I respond to someone who is consistent in attempting to denigrate me with a similarly snarky response! Live with it or find a kiddy forum where such childish outbursts as you have offered here today are expected. I did nothing to apologize for at all. I simply showed I'm human and misspoke on how far down the link the info was. Only an immature child would make an issue of such a thing. Oh wait, that explains everything. emoticon_frazzled",

   "Barbarian observes:\n For a Christian, the Genesis account is completely compatible with evolution. But Genesis cannot be reconciled with YE creationism. Do you claim to be a Christian? If so, how do you support the \"life ex nihilo\" doctrine of YE creationism, with God's Word, that says the Earth brought forth living things?\n \n \nExplain this \"life ex nihilo\" doctrine of YE creationism as you understand it to be, and I will respond to it.\n\n \n It is the central doctrine of YE, that God created living things from nothing. YE creationism, as you might know, was invented by the Seventh-Day Adventists in the early years of the last century, and was spread to fundamentalists by George McCready Price. One of his converts was Henry Morris, who founded the Institute for Creation Research, whose journal, \"Ex Nihilo\" was one of the reasons the movement split into OE and YE creationists.\n \n Traditionally, until the Adventists spread their doctrine to other denominations, almost all creationists were OE. That is the doctrine that was presented at the Scopes Trial, for example. \n \n As you seem to realize, the Adventists are wrong about this, and so are the YE who follow it. God says that the Earth brought forth living things. So for a Christian, a natural creation is God's way. If you aren't a strict YE creationist, good for you.\n \n \nAnd if you have an objective theological link which refers to it as a valid doctrine, I would love to also see that.\n\n \n As I said, it's not a valid doctrine at all.\n \n Barbarian observes:\n No, that's wrong, too. God created you by natural means, for example. Do you think it's wrong that He used natural means? Your body is a natural thing, still His creation, while your soul was given immediately by God. The primary difference between Christianity and YE creationism is that Christians accept the way He did it.\n \n \n\n Really? You claim I'm a cafeteria christian who accept some of Gods word, but not all of it? \n\n \n Yep. If you're an orthodox YE, that's what you are. \n \n \nI challenge you to prove that it isn't just the opposite and that you in fact aren't the cafeteria christian. I will post the passages which declare that God spoke creation into existence in 6 days, resting on the seventh. \n\n \n You've probably confused allegory with \"not true.\" Christians accept God's allegory in Genesis, because (as early Christians like Augustine pointed out) forcing a literal history on Genesis leads to logical absurdities.\n \n \nAnd you post your passage by natural means, in context of the way it was used and let's see who is right in their interpretation. OK? Here's my passage.\n \n Gen 1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\n \n Gen 1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness [was] upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.\n \n Gen 1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.\n \n Gen 1:4 And God saw the light, that [it was] good: and God divided the light from the darkness.\n \n Gen 1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.\n\n \n As Origen and Augustine said, it is absurd to imagine a morning and evening with no sun to have them.\n \n Gen 1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.\n \n \n Gen 1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which [were] under the firmament from the waters which [were] above the firmament: and it was so.\n \n Gen 1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.\n\n \n Ditto.\n \n \n Gen 1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl [that] may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.\n \n\n \n So YE goes out the window there. Life is not \"ex nihilo\", but is created naturally by God.\n \n \n Gen 1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.\n\n \n So as you see, there's no way to explain any of this away, but to accept the orthodox Christian understanding; it's an allegory of creation.\n \n Barbarian observes:\n You've been seriously misled if you actually believe that. Why not find out what Christians actually believe?\n \n \nI'm a Bible College graduate barbarian. So I know what the bible say's. \n\n \n It appears you are completely in denial of what it says.\n \n \nAnd it is Gods word which I trust \n\n \n It's your revision of God's word you did to make it more acceptable to you.\n \n Barbarian observes:\n Which is why I'm not a YE creationist. Some Christians do claim to be YE creationists, but they are cafeteria Christians, accepting some of God's Word, but not all of it.\n \n Come back to Christian faith. YE will not save you.\n \n \nAnd while you're at it, ask yourself how you can deny the whole first chapter of Genesis which proclaims how God personally spoke creation into existence, \n\n \n Christians aknowledge this, just as you do. The difference is, we accept the way He did it.\n \n \nAnd as for YEC not saving me; why state the obvious? It is faith in Jesus Christ who saves us from eternal separation from a perfect and holy God. Even a cafeteria christian should know that much.\n\n \n I'm glad you do. And you won't lose your salvation just for objecting to the way He did creation; it's not a salvation issue. But you'd have a closer relationship to Him, if you were willing to let Him do it His way.\n \n Worth letting go and trusting in Him with no reservations. Give it a try.",

You can't because it just isn't true.

God says that the Earth brought forth living things. So for a Christian, a natural creation is God's way. If you aren't a strict YE creationist, good for you.\n \n You have it all wrong barbarian. You are saying that God say's that the Earth brought forth living things. That just isn't accurate at all. What it say's is \"And God Said,\" Let the Earth bring forth the living creature after his kind.\n \n Gen 1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.\n \n God commanded it and it was so. Nothing in the text claims that God allowed or caused it to happen over hundreds of millions of years at all. That is a figment of your imagination.\n \n \nBarbarian observes:\n No, that's wrong, too. God created you by natural means, for example. Do you think it's wrong that He used natural means? Your body is a natural thing, still His creation, while your soul was given immediately by God. The primary difference between Christianity and YE creationism is that Christians accept the way He did it.\n\n \n Really? Does this sound like Adam was created by natural means or by personal interaction by an involved and caring creator? \n \n Gen 2:7 And the LORD God formed man [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being. Beside that, He said let us make man in our image.\n \n Gen 1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:  Can you actually interpret from this that He allowed us to evolve naturally from lower life forms? Also, look at every stage of Creation; it say's that \"GOD SAID\" that is an action verb, not a passive verb at all which you are implying it is if He just allowed us to evolve as you claim.\n \n \nYou've probably confused allegory with \"not true.\" Christians accept God's allegory in Genesis, because (as early Christians like Augustine pointed out) forcing a literal history on Genesis leads to logical absurdities.\n\n \n Look barbarian, don't do what evos always do and sanctimoniously speak down to me as if I don't know the meaning of allegory, not true and literal. And why do you refer to Augustine as if he's the end all of biblical interpretation? Your catholic roots are showing. Are you unable to comprehend the bible on its merits without someone else telling you what it means? Are you unaware that Jesus promised to send the Holy Spirit to guide us in all truth and understanding? So I rely on God Himself, not men to interpret it. \n \n \nAs Origen and Augustine said, it is absurd to imagine a morning and evening with no sun to have them.\n\n \n Who cares what they say in light of what the bible itself say's? \n \n Gen 1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.\n \n Gen 1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which [were] under the firmament from the waters which [were] above the firmament: and it was so.\n \n Gen 1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.\n \n Gen 1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry [land] appear: and it was so.\n \n Gen 1:10 And God called the dry [land] Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that [it was] good.\n \n At every point of our creation God was personally involved. And He separated the days from each other as He rested on the 7th day. This totally and completely conflicts with the claims made by evolution. You can call it an allegory but if you actually define what an allegory is, you will find that Genesis chapter 1 doesn't fit the definition at all as it's far to precise an explanation of what God did. The book of Revelation has some allegories in it, but not Genesis. Here, maybe this will help you understand what an allegory is. ALLEGORY\n \n \nBarbarian observes:\n You've been seriously misled if you actually believe that. Why not find out what Christians actually believe?\n\n \n Archangel observes:\n It is barbarian who is deceived and misled in his secular humanist interpretation of what Gods word actually say's as he interprets the bible according to his secular interpretation.\n \n \nIt's your revision of God's word you did to make it more acceptable to you.\n\n \n How can I be the revisionist if I'm interpreting the Genesis 1 literally? The revisionist is he who reinterprets it to say something it doesn't say at all. And that is you, my confused friend.",

Let's take a look...\n \n The prevailing notion of creationism in America at the time of the Scopes trial was OE. In fact, that is the creationism that was presented at the trial as opposed to science.\n \n From the transcript:\n \n DARROW: Would you say the earth was only 4,000 years old? \n \n BRYAN: Oh no, I think it is much older than that. \n \n DARROW: How much? \n \n BRYAN: I couldn't say. \n \n DARROW: Do you say whether the Bible itself says it is older than that? \n \n BRYAN: I don't think the Bible says itself whether it is older or not. \n \n DARROW: Do you think the earth was made in six days? \n \n BRYAN: Not six days of twenty-four hours. \n \n DARROW: Doesn't it say so? \n \n BRYAN: No, sir. \n \n The Scopes Trial\n \n Interestingly, Bryan's testimony touches on the founder of YE creationism, the Adventist George M. Price, but he doesn't discuss that new doctrine in his testimony.\n \n Many conservative Christians were shocked by evolutionary theory, but had little trouble accommodating an old earth with biblical faith. In 1909, both the Vatican and the \"Scofield Reference Bible,\" hugely influential among fundamentalists and evangelicals, said Genesis is literal history - but without requiring a young earth or 24-hour days.\n \n Today, there are few young earth creationists among the 1,800 evangelical scientists in the American Scientific Affiliation, a non-denominational group that believes in God as creator and \"the divine inspiration, trustworthiness and authority of the Bible.\" \n Seventh Day Advantist Believe in Young Earth\n \n \n\n You can't because it just isn't true.\n\n \n Now you know better.\n \n \nAnd prove that OE was proposed in the Scopes Trial, although I don't know what kind of valid evidence of anything that would be anyway.\n\n \n See above.

Which means the earth brought forth life. God uses nature to do most everything in this world. You, for example. He doesn't tell us how long it took. He gave us intelligence and curiosity to find out some things for ourselves.\n \n Barbarian observes:\n No, that's wrong, too. God created you by natural means, for example.

I'm also posting it to my favorites file for future use as its spiritual gold in testing the spirit behind those who claim to understand spiritual truths.\n Discernment of True and False Prophets/Teachers/Preachers/Churches\n \n IMPORTANT NOTE: This study also applies to true and false teachers/preachers, and *organizations. (*A church/ministry can also be a true or false prophet/teacher depending on what their doctrine says and how they go about preaching that doctrine.) \n \n A. A true prophet leads people to the Bible and to Jesus. \n If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord. ~ 1 Corinthians 14:37\n Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision. But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judea, and to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance. ~ Acts 26:19-20\n According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble, every man's work shall be made manifest. For the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss, but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire. ~ 1 Corinthians 3:10-15\n \n A false prophet speaks lies, leading people away from the Bible and Jesus.\n But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. And many shall follow their pernicious ways, by reason of whom the way of Truth shall be evil spoken of. And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make mechandise of you, whose judgement now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not. ~ 2 Peter 2:1-3\n And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus. But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith. ~ Acts 13:6, 8\n For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. ~ 2 Timothy 4:3-4 \n One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies. This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth. ~ Titus 10-14\n \n B. A true prophet confesses that Jesus Christ came in the flesh.\n Hereby ye know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God. ~ 1 John 4:2\n \n A false prophet brings in damnable heresies, denying the Lord who bought them, and does not proclaim that Jesus Christ came in the flesh.\n But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. ~ 2 Peter 2:1 \n And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God. And this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof you have heard that it should come, and even now already is it in the world. ~ 1 John 4:3\n \n .. C. A true prophet seeks to glorify God.\n He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory. But he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. ~ John 7:18\n \n A false prophet seeks glory for himself.\n For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's. ~ Philippians 2:21\n He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory... ~ John 7:18\n \n D. A true prophet speaks with God's wisdom given him by the power of God's spirit.\n For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. ~ 2 Peter 1:21 \n And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power. That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. ~ 1 Corinthians 2:4-5 \n Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but He revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets. ~ Amos 3:7\n \n A false prophet prophesies by his own wisdom or interpretation of Scripture.\n Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. ~ 2 Peter 1:20-21\n \n E. A true prophet gives warning, edification1, exhortation2, comfort and correction, as directed by God. \n So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at My mouth, and warn them from Me. ~ Ezekiel 33:7 \n Wherefore will ye plead with Me? Ye all have transgressed against Me, saith the Lord. In vain have I smitten your children, they received no correction. Your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion. ~ Jeremiah 2: 29-30\n Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day, I have even sent unto you all My servants, the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them...But thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the Lord their God, nor receiveth correction. Truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth. ~ Jeremiah 7:25, 28\n The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. ~ Jeremiah 28:8\n But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort. He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself, but he that prophesieth edifieth the church. I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied. For greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpet, that the church may receive edifying. ~ 1 Corinthians 14:3-5\n \n 1 edify: to instruct and improve especially by good example; benefit morally or spiritually\n 2 exhortation: earnesty spoken words of urgent advice or warning\n \n A false prophet speaks ONLY of peace and prosperity. \n Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you. They make you vain. They speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the LORD. They say still unto them that despise Me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you. ~ Jeremiah 23:16-17\n \n F. A true prophet will show good fruit and will exhibit the fruit of the Spirit.\n Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so, every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree can not bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. ~ Matthew 7:16-20\n But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance. Against such there is no law. ~ Galatians 5:22-23\n \n False prophets will show evil fruit and will exhibit the corrupt fruit of the devil.\n Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so, every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree can not bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. ~ Matthew 7:16-20\n For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, especially they of the circumcision, whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake. One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies. This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth. ~ Titus 10-14\n \n G. A true prophet rightly divides the Word of God. \n Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth. But shun profane and vain babblings, for they will increase unto more ungodliness. ~ 2 Timothy 2:15-16\n \n A false prophet shares opinions and distorts Scripture. \n As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest1, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. ~ 2 Peter 3:16 \n \n 1 wrest - to distort; to divert to an improper or unnatural use\n \n H. A true prophet puts his trust in God. \n Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is. ~ Jeremiah 17:7\n Trust ye in the Lord forever, for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength. ~ Isaiah 26:4\n For the king trusteth in the Lord, and through the mercy of the Most High he shall not be moved. ~ Psalm 21:7\n \n A false prophet puts his trust in men.\n Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD. ~ Jeremiah 17:5 \n \n I. A true prophet speaks the true prophecies. \n And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come), then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them. ~ Ezekiel 33:33\n \n A false prophet speaks lies and gives false prophecies.\n Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the [prophet1], Hear now, Hananiah, the Lord hath not sent thee, but thou makest this people to trust in a lie. ~ Jeremiah 28:15\n Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the Lord concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie...~ Jeremiah 29:31\n \n Note: 1prophet - In the Bible, both false and true prophets are called \"prophets\". One must read the context of the chapter to understand whether the \"prophet\" is true or false, such as in Hananiah's case. Hananiah was a false prophet, but Jeremiah was a true prophet, yet both were called \"prophets\".\n \n \n J. A true prophet does not accept money for God's words.\n Throughout the entire Bible, none of God's prophets ever required money to deliver God's messages. The entire Bible is a testament of this.\n But godliness with contentment is great gain. ~ 1 Timothy 6:6\n And having food and raiment let us be therewith content. ~ 1 Timothy 6:8\n \n A false prophet charges, or expects payment, for his words.\n If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness, he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil-surmisings, perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the Truth, supposing that gain is godliness. From such withdraw thyself. But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food and raiment let us be therewith content. But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil, which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.~ 1 Timothy 6:3-10\n No servant can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon1. ~ Luke 16:13 \n And [through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you2], whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not. ~ 2 Peter 2:3\n For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, especially they of the circumcision, whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake. One of themselves, a prophet of their own... ~ Titus 10-12\n \n 1 mammon: an often personified devotion to material possessions; also wealth\n 2 [in their greed, these teachers will exploit you with stories they have made up] - NIV\n 3 lucre: monetary gain; profit; also money\n \n K. A true prophet is socially unacceptable to the proud and does not conform to people's expectations. \n For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called. But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are, that no flesh should glory in his presence. ~ 1 Corinthians 1:26-29 \n \n A false prophet is socially acceptable and conforms to people's expectations. \n For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. ~ 2 Timothy 4:3-4 \n \n L. True prophets are generally disliked. \n Rejoice, and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. ~ Matthew 5:12 \n Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience. ~ James 5:10 \n \n False prophets are generally liked. \n Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you, for so did their fathers to the false prophets. ~ Luke 6:26 \n \n M. There are few true prophets. \n Then said Elijah to the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the Lord, but Baal's prophets are found four hundred and fifty men. ~ 1 Kings 18:22\n \n Note: We are able to discern from 1 Kings 18:22 that while there were many false prophets of Baal and other gods, there was only one prophet, Elijah, of the True God. In the New Testament, we are shown that there will be more prophets as compared to the Old Testament...\"To another, faith by the same Spirit; to another, the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, discerning of spirits; to another, diverse kinds of tongues; to another, the interpretation of tongues\" [1 Corinthians 12:9-10]. Even though there are more true prophets spoken of in the New Testament, the number will be less than the number of false prophets (see the verses below - the word \"many\").\n \n There are many false prophets. \n Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table. ~ 1 Kings 18:19\n And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. ~ Matthew 24:11\n Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? And in thy name have cast out devils? And in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you. Depart from Me, ye that work iniquity. ~ Matthew 7:22-23\n Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God, because many false prophets are gone out into the world. ~ 1 John 4:1\n \n N. The prophecies of a true prophet will come to pass.\n And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come), then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them. ~ Ezekiel 33:33\n \n The predictions of a false prophet will not come to pass.\n When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously. Thou shalt not be afraid of him. ~ Deuteronomy 18:22 \n \n \n Beloved, believe not every spirit,\n but try the spirits whether they are of God, \n because many false prophets are gone out into the world. \n ~ 1 John 4:1\n \n Jesus warns us that in these last times, there would be \"wolves\" in \"sheep's\" clothing (Matthew 7:15). Please remember, when testing the prophets or anyone who claims to be a servant of the Most High God, to use all Scripture, but especially the verses we've just noted. We cannot take only one verse of the Bible and judge whether or not someone is true or false. We must look at all the evidence and then decide for ourselves...Scripture is the rod by which we shall measure everything, including the validity of those who claim to be God's servants.",

If you don't know that, you don't know anything about it..\n \n \nThe Creation model is all about common descent as well.\n\n \n It is, but the creationist model isn't. They deny common descent.\n \n Barbarian, regarding human races:\n An identifiable sub-population of a species. However, the human genome project has shown that there are no biological human races. \"Race\", in humans, is merely a cultural idea, with no objective existence.\n \n \nExactly - So what are Darwin's 'favored races'.\n\n \n He was talking about what we now call \"species.\" Not about humans at all.\n \n \nHitler had his idea and he got that justification from Darwin. Eugenics is from Darwin, too.\n\n \n No, that's a common misconception. Darwin wrote:\n \n The surgeon may harden himself whilst performing an operation,\n for he knows that he is acting for the good of his patient; but if\n we were intentionally to neglect the weak and helpless, it could\n only be for a contingent benefit, with an overwhelming present evil.\n Charles Darwin The Descent of Man\n \n And later, Punnett (a Darwinist of Punnett Square fame) showed that classical eugenics was fatally flawed being unable to remove harmful recessives from a population. \n \n Hitler's claim to be scientific was dishonest. On the other hand, relative to his claim to be a Christian, about 90% of the Wannsee Protocol (the \"final solution\" for the Jews) is found in Martin Luther's advice to princes on what to do with the Jews. ( The Jews and Their Lies)\n \n \nKilling Aboriginies and Native Americans came from the idea that those savages weren't fully human yet anyway.\n\n \n As you might know, Darwin deplored such thinking; he even got into a major row with creationist captain of the Beagle, who asserted that slavery was good for \"inferior races\". Darwin denied it, and celebrated when slavery was abolished in the British Empire.\n \n \nThis cultural idea got a big boost from Darwinism and survival of the fittest and the 'common good'.\n\n \n Nope. They misled you about that, too. See Darwin's comments above. \n \n \nIs evolutionary 'science' important to justify things that evil gov'ts like to do? \n\n \n As you learned, Hitler used Christianity to justify killing the Jews. When you are evil, any ideology will do. But if you're honest, you'll admit that Darwin and Darwinists assailed such thinking.",

One is justified by works and faith.\n \n Even more clearly, in Matthew 25, Jesus says:\n \n Matt:25:31 And when the Son of man shall come in his majesty, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty. 32 And all nations shall be gathered together before him, and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats: 33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left. 34 Then shall the king say to them that shall be on his right hand: Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 35 For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in:\n \n 36 Naked, and you covered me: sick, and you visited me: I was in prison, and you came to me. 37 Then shall the just answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, and fed thee; thirsty, and gave thee drink? 38 And when did we see thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and covered thee? 39 Or when did we see thee sick or in prison, and came to thee? 40 And the king answering, shall say to them: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me.\n \n 41 Then he shall say to them also that shall be on his left hand: Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels. 42 For I was hungry, and you gave me not to eat: I was thirsty, and you gave me not to drink. 43 I was a stranger, and you took me not in: naked, and you covered me not: sick and in prison, and you did not visit me. 44 Then they also shall answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee? 45 Then he shall answer them, saying: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it not to one of these least, neither did you do it to me.\n \n 46 And these shall go into everlasting punishment: but the just, into life everlasting. \n \n \nDo you know that there is only one mediator between God and Man, the man Christ Jesus? Not a priest! And only God can forgive sins, not priests?\n\n \n If so, then Jesus lied when he told Peter that he could. This goes back to your \"pick and chose\" version of Christianity. You take the parts you like, and reject the rest.\n \n Barbarian observes:\n Apparently, not. We'll just note that you have a rather surprising twist on Genesis and leave it at that.\n \n \nNo I don't barbarian. My interpretation of Genesis is the historical theologically correct interpretation which was held to by the 1st century Apostles and disciples of Jesus Christ.\n\n \n Nope. Sola fide and sola Scriptura are modern, man-made doctrines. Scripture even says it's not the only authority:\n \n Romans 1:18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and injustice of those men that detain the truth of God in injustice: 19 Because that which is known of God is manifest in them. For God hath manifested it unto them. 20 For the invisible things of him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made; his eternal power also, and divinity: so that they are inexcusable. \n \n As you see, the Bible itself says that other sources of authority exist, so clear and understandable that men have no excuse. Paul is talking to you here; listen to him.\n \n \nYours are the watered down, man made interpretations of a corrupted church which has redefined what the bible actually say's in order to fit their human perspective.\n\n \n You're unhappy that orthodox Christians accept all of God's word, because it reflects badly on your practice of picking the parts you like and rejecting the rest.\n \n \nHere is a list of CATHOLIC HERESIES And HUMAN TRADITIONS\n\n \n All breakaway sects insist that the Church is \"heretical.\" Only their own adherents believe those stories. I don't think there's any chance of making any headway with you, so we'll just note that your sect differs in this regard, and go on. Feel free to have one last blast at the Church without me correcting you again.\n \n And we'll get back to the subject. Do you have anything but your modern doctrines that undercuts genetic variation as a source of evolutionary change?",

It was pandion who was criticizing smallax based on poor and antiquated terminology according to you. \n \n And Tester also is asking if I'm serious, or if I understand when Darwins book was written. Why would anyone correct or question me when pandion referred to this term as if it was still valid, not me. Unless none of you noticed, it was me who called pandion on his improper defense of the term as he used it against smallax. My question, is why do you all focus your corrections on me when it is one of your own who made the error?\n \n \nYEC is an invention of the 20th century and was brought into the fundamentalist sects (another 20th century invention) largely through the work of Henry Morris of the ICR.\n\n \nAnd feel free to actually prove that YEC is a 20th century invention if you can.\n\n \nRead The Creationists by Ronald L. Numbers. Yet another view that you have that you somehow think has always been. Educating yourself is actually easy if you weren't afraid to learn.\n\n Pandion, you said this in your prior post: YEC is an invention of the 20th century and was brought into the fundamentalist sects (another 20th century invention) largely through the work of Henry Morris of the ICR.\n \n You are in error. The young earth creationist \"interpretation\" of the bible goes all the way back to the \"1st century apostles\". What Henry Morris is, is considered to be the \"father of young earth creation SCIENCE.\" He's not considered the originator of the the YEC interpretation of the bible by any means. Henry M. Morris - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n Henry Madison Morris, Ph.D. (October 6, 1918 &#8211; February 25, 2006) was an American young earth creationist and Christian apologist, educated primarily in the field of hydraulic engineering. He was one of the founders of the Creation Research Society and the Institute for Creation Research, and is considered by many to be \"the father of modern creation science.\"\n As it clearly say's, he was a young Earth Creationist before he ever set out to prove it using science.\n \n \n We have here a good example of the uneducated speaking as if they had actually learned anything about the issue or actually put some thought into it. With just a little bit of learning one is able to find out that Darwin's most frequent use of the word \"races\" was in reference to dometsic plants and animals. \n \n From On the Origin of Species:\n \n ...if we could succeed in naturalising, or were to cultivate, during many generations, the several races, for instance, of the cabbage,...\n \n When we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants,...\n \n Domestic races of the same species,...\n \n That's just a few references from the 1st chapter. This is what happens when someone with limited education and understanding comes to think that all words throughout time have always meant what they mean in that persons limited understanding. We see another example of such thought in the arguments of the young earth creationists on this board. They have adopted the dogma of the SDA as their own and now insist that all christians have always believed as they do. YEC is an invention of the 20th century and was brought into the fundamentalist sects (another 20th century invention) largely through the work of Henry Morris of the ICR.\n \n So, one person's small world, where race always refers to whites and blacks, Darwin must have been a racist since he used to word. Today we use \"domestic variety\" where Darwin used \"race.\" If it is not simple ignorance, then it is blatent dishonesty.\n",

In FACT, Darwins use of the word race wasn't correct 150 years ago. If it was still correct, it would still be in use as you quoted his usage. His usage was wrong then scientifically speaking and it is no longer used because it has been proven to be wrong, scientifically speaking.

You were just focussing op his ignorance for not knowing the proper use of the term RACE while never implying at all that it was Darwin who used it improperly back then. In fact smallax wasn't abusing how Darwin used the word race at all based on his comment which I quote below for your edification. \n \n And thirdly, he never called Darwin a racist at all. You say in this quoted post: Smallax (and you by your defense of his position) is using the word in the modern sense in an effort to show that Darwin was a racist.  \n \n That just isn't true no matter how you slice it. But nice job trying to also implicate me in your fallacious accusation against him. I must assume it was to intimidate me. But here is what he originally said: \"This cultural idea got a big boost from Darwinism\" and survival of the fittest and the 'common good'. (read the complete statement for his full meaning below) And it is obvious he was making no claims at all about Darwin personally being a racist, but was commenting that his writings were corrupted and perverted by people who used them to justify their racist bent. Much like you and your cohorts corrupt and pervert the bible for your own ends. And he is absolutely right about that claim. Darwin has been used by racists to justify oppressing certain groups of people. That has been historically documented.\n [smallax to Barbarian]Exactly - So what are Darwin's 'favored races'. Hitler had his idea and he got that justification from Darwin. Eugenics is from Darwin, too. Killing Aboriginies and Native Americans came from the idea that those savages weren't fully human yet anyway.\n \n This cultural idea got a big boost from Darwinism and survival of the fittest and the 'common good'. \n \n Is evolutionary 'science' important to justify things that evil gov'ts like to do? Do gov't forms still have race questions on them today? Yes.\n \n You need to learn to interpret what the opposition is really saying before you accuse them of being ignorant and misrepresenting what they actually said.",
