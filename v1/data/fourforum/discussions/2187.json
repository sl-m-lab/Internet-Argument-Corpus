   "Our lit teacher has a reputation for saying a little too much of whats on her mind, she told the 7th grade class that the 8th grade girls (my class) dress like tramps in the spring...we asked several people if it was true and all agreed me and my friend Marta confronted her about in and she exploded she denied the whole incidnet. Im really bothered by this, mostly because she always seems to say that we're trashy in some way, which we're not, seriously, does anyone have ideas in which way i should go about this, the last time we tried again it didnt go well...i was very close to being sent to the principals office which wouldnt be anything new but still...so tell me what you think or if im over reacting or whatever",

   "Hi Katie,\n \n Why is a teacher's opinion that you don't agree with such a problem? It sounds like names weren't named, so no person should take offense. Teachers - like students - should be free to voice their opinion. \n \n If you don't like someone's opinion, discuss it if possible (sounds like this was not possible). Then honestly consider the other person's opinion. Maybe there are a few girls who dress 'trashy.'\n \n I teach seventh and eighth grade and I can tell you, there are many girls who could easily be confused with prostitutes if seen on the streets at night. I know that many girls have to change clothes before school because their parents won't allow them to wear provocative items.\n \n I'm glad you tried to speak with your teacher, but remember \"you can catch more bees with honey than with vineger.\" (that means try not to be confrontational, try for a calm dialogue.)",

Speaking from a guys' point of view, what a girl wears often does say something about their character. While I will not say that that makes these 8th graders tramps, I would suggest thinking about what first impressions will say. \n \n But the teacher's actions were uncalled for. Not for speaking up, but for speaking to the wrong audience and using the wrong words.",

They allow students to learn to be part of a group. Unless you end up becoming Ultimate Ruler of the Universe, you'll always be someone's inferior. In the workforce, anyway. Might as well get used to it.\n \n My school is all uniforms. Anyone who goes against the dress code (which doesn't allow painted nails, skirts above the knee, hair spiked over two inches, ANY dying/highlighting of the hair, socks above the ankle, etc.) gets a demerit, ten of which result in detention. Now, somehow the girls in my class seem to get away with dressing like a slut whilst still within the dress code. (Example: \"The dress code doesn't say that we can't keep our blouse unbuttoned!\" I mean - o.O Seriously. This was brought up.)\n \n Almost all girls dress like sluts. It's disgusting.",

   "I agree with Lily, dress codes are wonderful, when enforced correctly. At my school we have a pretty strict dress code which is constantly disobeyed. If its guy found disobeying the dress code, even by a small amount, they are almost always handed a detention and given a school shirt to wear. On the other hand when ever a girl goes and wears short shorts and a t-shirt meant for a toddler the teachers turn the other way(the guys though are transfixed by them). Its not only the thin petite girls that do this, oh no, its every girl at are school save a few. How is it that they are all getting away with this disrespect to the dress code without anyone saying anything?",
