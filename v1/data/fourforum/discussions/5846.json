Rather than watering down the G8 communique on climate change to the point of making it worthless, there is a chance he might get some backbone and isolate the USA by issuing a \"G7\" communique instead:\n \n http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foreignaffairs/story/0,11538,1518814,00.html\n \n Don't get your hopes up though: British PMs are notoriously bad at arse-licking American presidents rather than telling them where to shove their numbskull positions.\n \n This bit I found very telling:\n 'The problem for the Bush administration is that if it concedes that the science is right and the risk is great, then action to curb emissions must be taken. This is politically difficult in a country that emits 25% of the world's carbon dioxide and is wedded to cheap petrol and big cars. \n \n Mr Bush acknowledged last night that economic factors played a large role in guiding US environment policy. \"Kyoto would have wrecked our economy,\" he said.\"'\n \n This is the reason we see Americans here objecting to global warming: not because of science, but because of their greedy need to fill their wallets and continue with an unsustainable consumption society. We have reached the stage now where the USA must be isolated by the rest of the world on this issue. If they won't address the problem themselves, then the rest of the world should introduce trade sactions against the USA, to either force them to cut back on their pollution levels, or to bring their economy down anyway thus making their opposition to global warming action a pointless excercise.",

In a paper due to be published in an upcoming volume of the Annals of Glaciology, Paul Mayewski, director of UMaine's Climate Change Institute, and 11 colleagues from China, Australia and UMaine describe evidence from ice cores pointing to an association between the waxing and waning of zonal wind strength around Antarctica and a chemical signal of changes in the sun's output.\n \n At the heart of the paper, Solar Forcing of the Polar Atmosphere, are calcium, nitrate and sodium data from ice cores collected in four Antarctic locations and comparisons of those data to South Pole ice core isotope data for beryllium-10, an indicator of solar activity. The authors also point to data from Greenland and the Canadian Yukon that suggest similar relationships between solar activity and the atmosphere in the northern hemisphere. They focus on years since 1400 when the Earth entered a roughly 500-year period known as the Little Ice Age.\n \n The researchers' goal is to understand what drives the Earth's climate system without taking increases in greenhouse gases into account, says Mayewski. \"There are good reasons to be concerned about greenhouse gases, but we should be looking at the climate system with our eyes open,\" he adds. Understanding how the system operates in the absence of human impacts is important for responding to climate changes that might occur in the future.\n \n Mayewski founded the International Transantarctic Scientific Expedition (ITASE) and is the co-author of The Ice Chronicles: The Quest to Understand Global Climate Change, published in 2002 with Frank White. The United States' ITASE office is located at UMaine. Antarctic locations used in the paper include: Law Dome, a 4,576-foot high ice mound located about 68 miles from the coast facing the Indian Ocean and the site of an Australian research station; Siple Dome, a 2,000-foot high ice covered mound located between two ice streams that flow out of the Transantarctic Mountains into the Ross ice shelf, and the site of a U.S. research station; and two ITASE field sites west of Siple Dome where ice cores were collected during field surveys in 2000 and 2001.\n \n The authors are Mayewski, Kirk A. Maasch, Eric Meyerson, Sharon Sneed, Susan Kaspari, Daniel Dixon, and Erich Osterberg, all from UMaine; Yping Yan of the China Meterological Association; Shichang Kang of UMaine and the Chinese Academy of Sciences; and Vin Morgan, Tas van Ommen and Mark Curran of the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems CRC in Tasmania.\n \n Since at least the 1840s when sunspot cycles were discovered, scientists have proposed that solar variability could affect the climate, but direct evidence of that relationship and understanding of a mechanism have been lacking.\n \n The ice core data show, the authors write, that when solar radiation increases, more calcium is deposited at Siple Dome and at one of the ITASE field sites. The additional calcium may reflect an increase in wind strength in mid-latitude regions around Antarctica, they add, especially over the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Calcium in West Antarctic ice cores is thought to derive mainly from dust in Australia, Africa and South America and from sea salt in the southern ocean.\n \n That finding, they note, is consistent with other research suggesting that the sun may affect the strength of those mid-latitude winds through changes in stratospheric ozone over Antarctica.\n \n The authors also refer to sodium data from Siple Dome ice cores that have been reported by Karl Kreutz, director of UMaine's stable isotope laboratory. Changes in sodium appear to be associated with air pressure changes over the South Pacific.\n \n Ice core data from Law Dome focus on changes in nitrate and may reflect changing wind patterns over Antarctica. The wind currents that bring nitrate to the continent, however, are less well known than those that carry sodium and calcium.\n \n Researchers in the UMaine Climate Change Institute (http://www.climatechange.umaine.edu/) have focused on the relationship between solar variability and climate, particularly the use of isotopes in tree rings and ice cores to provide an indication of the sun's strength. The ice core data reported in the paper demonstrates a direct atmospheric consequence associated with changing solar radiation.\n\n \n hmmm, man made fluorocarbons vs solar flares\n i wonder which one has greater impact on the climate.\n hmmm,",

DESIGN: Descriptive study. SETTING: Eleven US cancer registries that constitute the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER-11). PATIENTS: Patients with malignant melanoma of the skin reported between 1992 and 2001. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pearson correlation coefficients and regression coefficients were used to estimate the relationship of age-adjusted melanoma incidence rates (2000 US standard population) with the UV index or latitude within racial and ethnic groups. RESULTS: A higher mean UV index was significantly associated with an increase in melanoma incidence only in non-Hispanic whites (r = 0.85, P = .001), although a nonsignificant association was noted in Native Americans (r = 0.42, P = .20). Negative, but not significant, correlations with incidence were observed in blacks (r = -0.53, P = .10), Hispanics (r = -0.43, P = .19), and Asians (r = -0.28, P = .41). Latitude also had a significant correlation with incidence only in non-Hispanic whites (r = -0.85, P = .001). A substantial portion of the variance in registry incidence in non-Hispanic whites could be explained by the UV index (R(2) = 0.71, P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Melanoma incidence is associated with increased UV index and lower latitude only in non-Hispanic whites. No evidence to support the association of UV exposure and melanoma incidence in black or Hispanic populations was found.\n\n sounds good?\n \nSun exposure and mortality from melanoma.\n Berwick M, Armstrong BK, Ben-Porat L, Fine J, Kricker A, Eberle C, Barnhill R.\n University of New Mexico, Department of Internal Medicine, New Mexico Cancer Research Facility, MSC08 4630, Room 103A, 1 University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA. \n \n BACKGROUND: Melanoma incidence and survival are positively associated, both geographically and temporally. Solar elastosis, a histologic indicator of cutaneous sun damage, has also been positively associated with melanoma survival. Although these observations raise the possibility that sun exposure increases melanoma survival, they could be explained by an association between incidence and early detection of melanoma. We therefore evaluated the association between measures of skin screening and death from cutaneous melanoma. METHODS: Case subjects (n = 528) from a population-based study of cutaneous melanoma were followed for an average of more than 5 years. Data, including measures of intermittent sun exposure, perceived awareness of the skin, skin self-screening, and physician screening, were collected during in-person interviews and review of histopathology and histologic parameters (i.e., solar elastosis, Breslow thickness, and mitoses) for all of the lesions. Competing risk models were used to compute risk of death (hazard ratios [HRs], with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) from melanoma. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Sunburn, high intermittent sun exposure, skin awareness histories, and solar elastosis were statistically significantly inversely associated with death from melanoma. Melanoma thickness, mitoses, ulceration, and anatomic location on the head and neck were statistically significantly positively associated with melanoma death. In a multivariable competing risk analysis, skin awareness (with versus without, HR = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.3 to 0.9, P = .022) and solar elastosis (present versus absent, HR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2 to 0.8, P = .009) were strongly and independently associated with melanoma death after adjusting for Breslow thickness, mitotic index, and head and neck location, which were also independently associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: Sun exposure is associated with increased survival from melanoma.\n\n what does this mean?\n \nThe effect of sun exposure in determining nevus density in UK adolescent twins.\n Wachsmuth RC, Turner F, Barrett JH, Gaut R, Randerson-Moor JA, Bishop DT, Bishop JA.\n Genetic Epidemiology Division, Cancer Research UK, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, UK.\n \n We report a study of 221 teenage twin pairs to examine the genetic and environmental determinants of nevi representing the most potent phenotypic risk factor for melanoma. Our published heritability analysis estimated that nevi are mainly genetically determined. In this paper we examine the role of sun exposure. We report a correlation between nevus density and sun exposure, particularly that acquired in hotter countries than in the UK (mean nevus density 41 per m2 in those in the highest quartile of exposure vs 24 per m2 in those with no exposure, p<0.0001). We were not able to demonstrate a protective effect for either sun protection cream or shirt wearing. By including phenotypic variables and reported sun exposure into the heritability analysis, we conclude that 66% of the total variance of nevus count is attributable to genetic effects: 7% associated to eye color, 6% to hair color, and 1% to reported skin type, which leaves 52% as to yet unidentified genetic factors. Of the 25% of variation attributable to environmental influences, one-third is estimated to be because of sun exposure on hot holidays.\n\n is this saying that sun exposure is responsible for 8% (1/3 or 25%) of all melanoma? about what it is (7%) for eye color! i am ready to ban certain eye colors!\n \n what is the concensus here i wonder.\n \n \n \n perhaps you can get me better links? besides, it is good form to back up your assertion rather than have the other person search for it.\n \n \n @Daewoo\n that global warming exist is probably true. but it is likely a natural phenomena. what we contribute to as humans is unclear, but are not likely to the modulating contribution.\n and its significance is uncertain, whether it be skin cancer or melting of the ice caps or a new ice age.\n \n but this is a deviation from the thread imo. there is already another thread about global warming.\n \n this was about Kyoto, which i see as\n 1. predicated on the questionable significance of human contribution to global warming\n 2. that the protocols within the Kyoto agreement is able to effectively reign it in, assuming #1 to be true.\n 3. that shrub disregarded science for economics, while he has repeatedly argued against #2 being effective without greater limitations on the developing countries dirty fuel consumption. take china, whose oil consumption is on the rapid ascent, is not a party to the accord.",

   "...If Bush has an economic reason for rejecting Kyoto, that means anyone who rejects global warming is being dishonest...\nNot quite. Bush is just the public face of those that reject Kyoto: his reasons are purely economic as there is no longer a serious scientific case against global warming.\n \n \nThis is a truly lame argument, and increasingly typical of global warming advocates. Instead of presenting scientific argument, their opponents are demonised. And then you wonder why people don't find you convincing.\nOh but they are convincing: that is why most scientists are now convinced. We are just left with those that refuse to be convinced by the overwhelming evidence. Ridiculing and demonising these assinine few is the only sane course of action left.",

   "a concensus on gravity does not make it more or less true. that there is concensus on these things is irrelevant.\nFair enough: if you choose to arbitarily accept or reject ideas regardless of where the weight of evidence, and thus the scientific consensus, points, then so be it.\n \n \nit wasn't a comparison of intelligent design to evolution now was it. but since you brought it up, the parallel of man made global warming vs solar induced global warming is perhaps acurate. i think man made global warming has as much credibility as intelligent design.\nYou might feel that comparison is credible. But you have just indicated that you see the weight of evidence, and thus the scientific consensus, as irrelevent.

There is no scientific proof: just the weight of evidence. The scientific evidence in the evolution/ idiot design debate points conclusively toward evolution. This doesn't constitute a \"scientific proof\".

   "This is the reason we see Americans here objecting to global warming: not because of science, but because of their greedy need to fill their wallets and continue with an unsustainable consumption society. We have reached the stage now where the USA must be isolated by the rest of the world on this issue. If they won't address the problem themselves, then the rest of the world should introduce trade sactions against the USA, to either force them to cut back on their pollution levels, or to bring their economy down anyway thus making their opposition to global warming action a pointless excercise.\nThis is the real deal. Let's see if I have this right. The US won't sign the Koyoto treaty so the world can sue for damages and ruin their economy, so let's try to do it anyway, damn it. The left really show their hand here. This was never about global warming at all, so it doesn't matter if humans are responsible for the warming. This is about money and bringing down the United States. Glad you admitted it Clive14, and I'm glad we haven't had a President willing to sign on to Koyoto.
