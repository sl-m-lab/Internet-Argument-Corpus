Do you think that some passages are written ambiguously enough, purposefully or not, to be open to more than one interpretation?\n \n Or do you feel that your interpretation of the entire Bible is the only truth?\n\n \n It is true that some verses and passages can be interpreted differently by different people. God speaks to each individual with His Word, but the life principle verses mean the same thing to everyone. For example, the Ten Commandments mean the same thing for everyone, or were intended to. As do divorce laws and adultery laws, and yes the laws pertaining to homosexuality. They didn't change between the Old and New Testaments but how God deals with the homosexual did. In the Old He also commanded that the adulterer be stoned to death also, so He was perfectly consistent in His treatment of these sins of the flesh.\n \n In the Old Testament He said to kill the homosexual, but in the New, He died for the gay, the adulterer and straight alike leaving room for all to be saved if they receive the gift of salvation.",

   "Why is everything always about sex for you AA? :p\n\n \n Sorry, I was kinda anticipating the direction he would go. emoticon_emb \n \n \nDo you think that the passages about the last supper and the importance of the bread and wine are open to interpretation?\n\n \n I think as practices and traditions they are much simpler than the RCC has made it out to be. I think Jesus was pretty clear in what He said at the last supper.\n \n \nIn my view there is one correct interpretation of the Bible, but I'm not so deluded as to believe I have necessarily discerned it correctly, hence there are a wide range of views I am prepared to consider as Christian.\n\n \n I think that the problem isn't so much with interpretation but in connecting the different parts of the Bible together as a complete picture of what God intends for us. That is what leads to different interpretations. For example, the verse about the Rapture\n \n \n1Cr 15:52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.\n\n \n From this one verse we have at least 4 different interpretations. That it will happen before the tribulation period, midway through it, or at the end of it. And some, few as they may be believe it is referring to another period in history all together. So it's connecting this verse with all the other prophecies in their right order and context that causes the so called different interpretations of the bible. There is only one proper interpretation of the bible, it's our understanding that is limited.\n \n What should comfort us all is that God's interpretation is the one that counts and He will be faithful to that truth no matter what we think. And as long as we don't change his Word, its meaning or His intent then He will forgive our ignorance in not understanding every aspect of it as we place prophecies in the wrong order at times. The good news is that as we get closer to the end times, they become more clear and easier to place in proper context.",

   "I think it's important to note that most Christians, IMO, would probably say that many issues are open to interpretation and therefore not so rigid after all. Even AA here gives an example of a passage that can be interpreted numerous ways. \n \n There are actually only a relatively few things in the Bible that are not really open to interpretation in order to be Christian. But I find these things in scripture to be pretty straight-forward and unambiguous; it's not like they are unclear if the scriptures are read. For example, the only way to interpret the Bible as saying Jesus didn't resurrect after all, is to completely reject or ignore significant and important sections of the scriptures.\n \n I guess my point is that there are issues in the Bible that are always going to be open to interpretation and discussion, but then there are the essentials, which are pretty much required to be there in order to reasonably be called a Christian. For example, you can't reasonably be called a Christian (IMO) if you don't believe Jesus was real or that the resurrection didn't really happen. These essentials are NOT open to interpretation beyond their details, at least. Many attempts have been made to list these essentials, in form of creeds. IMO, the apostle's creed sums them up reasonably well.",

   "In other words, \"I just got called on my claim and it was pointed out that what I claimed wasn't listed in the source I gave, so now I'll cry persecution, and run off sobbing like a little child that got its lolipop stolen.\"\n \n Real mature, Archie. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n You quoted my statement but I missed the part where I cried persecution. Could you point it out for me ? And I probably should have realized that you guys couldn't comprehend what the lexicon didn't say about the word kill used in the original Hebrew. and that is that it didn't say killing in War or executing criminals such as murderers or rapists was wrong. Those are lawful killings, but for revenge, envy, strife, jealousy, anger, passion or greed, these are wrong reasons for killing.\n \n So when I said that the word kill used in the commandment means to not kill unjustly; as abreviated as that definition is, do you really think it was wrong ? Or just not as complete as it could have been.",
