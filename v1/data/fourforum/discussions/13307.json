   "What would you do? \n \n Personally, I'd make it so that only people who either really forced somebody to do something they didn't want to do, did it to someone who are physically or mentally unable to resist (children, mentally challenged people, etc.), or intoxicated someone to paralyze them or put them to sleep, then had sex with them.\n \n It happens far too often; an eighteen year old has sex with his fifteen year old girlfriend, they break up down the road and she has him put on trial for pedophilia. I personally knew a kid in high school who was put of that, to this day he is a person I would trust with my life, and I am 99% sure that he did not rape a fifteen year old girl.",
