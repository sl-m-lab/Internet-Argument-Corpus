   "There are probably differences of opinion on just what a \"muscle car\" actually is, mainly in that some don't consider \"pony cars\" like Mustangs/Camaros to be muscle cars. The true muscle cars were the mid size, big engine cars like the GTO, Chevelle, Fairlane, Plymouth GTX, Roadrunner, etc. I guess today's GTO might qualify, but I don't think they're selling well. (did they discontinue them yet?) \n \n If the main consideration is easy horsepower, GM (Chevrolet) will win in most polls everytime. If a more overall criteria is included, it gets more difficult. By the late 60's, Ford had the toughest rear axles and 4 speed transmissions by far. \n \n I've always been a Ford guy, but of all the GM's, I did really like the 64 -67 GTO's, especially the convertibles. And the Plymouth Roadrunners - plain jane, with power! :) Ford has always hooked me with their style (and quality, in my experiences) and the right person building their engines can wake them up!",

Today it coves anything rear drive with a big V8 that isn't like a Camry, so even the modest Marauder with its 4.6 V8 would make the grade.\n \n Interesting thing about the Dodge Viper was that the Chrysler 360ci V8 motor was the starting point for developing the original 8 liter V10. In the old days I believe AMC holds the record for the only production small block over 400 cubes (their 401 ci of 1971-74).emoticon_cool",

U.S. auto history from the early 50's to mid 70's is interesting stuff.",

It had a cartoon decal of a devil with a pitchfork and in ads a guy in a Devil outfit carried the pitchfork. I believe that conservative church groups weren't too pleased about the name and the ads. However, the real reason the model was dropped probably had more to do with rising insurance premiums and falling speedy car sales.\n \n Chrysler really let one out of the bag in 1955 with the 300C, startling peformance from the Hemi V8 (1 hp per ci). Great engineering in combining overhead valve with a hemispherical layout. That design made Mopar king of the dragstrip and it's a motor that is still with us today, and hopefully into the future.emoticon_cool\n \n http://www.71superbee.com/images/Ad/press_photo_2.jpg",
