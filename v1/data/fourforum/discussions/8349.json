   "Some part of Eastern Europe countries (Poland, Romania and Bulgaria) are continuing to deliver weapons to Georgia free of charge. And active Georgia president Saakashvili is making weapons deport from Georgia with pleasure on the threshold of military campaign against Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Moreover after weapons delivering to Georgia and then by corrupt militaries it's spreading to Caucasian district. As I know weapon hidings were found in Chechnya, Iraq and Afghanistan and the weapons are falling there by Chechens and Arabs volunteers who are trained in Georgian Pankissi gorge. \n Not long ago the track of Georgian weapons was found even in Somali. UN representatives reported that weapons stream grew with the beginning of Islamists offensive against the government army. \n I think that Georgian officials just use the situation and resell weapons delivered from Eastern Europe. By this way Saakshvlili's regime creates tensity not in the Caucasus, but in Africa too.",
