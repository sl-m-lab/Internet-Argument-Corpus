   "By The Associated Press\n 08.27.2009 5:14pm EDT\n \n (Salt Lake City) Utah Gov. Gary Herbert said Thursday that discriminating against gay people shouldn't be illegal, although he would prefer it if everyone were treated with respect.\n \n In his most definitive comments yet on gay rights, Herbert told reporters he doesn't believe sexual orientation should be a protected class in the way that race, gender and religion are.\n \n \"We don't have to have a rule for everybody to do the right thing. We ought to just do the right thing because it's the right thing to do and we don't have to have a law that punishes us if we don't,\" Herbert said in his first monthly KUED news conference.\n \n In Utah, it is legal to fire someone for being gay or transgender. The gay rights advocacy group Equality Utah has been trying to change state law for several years but has always been rebuffed by the Republican-controlled Legislature.\n \n Last year, the group got Republican Gov. Jon Huntsman's support for extending some rights to gay people, although none of the bills it backed became law.\n \n Huntsman resigned earlier this month to become U.S. ambassador to China, leaving Herbert, who was lieutenant governor, in charge of the state until a special election in 2010.\n \n Will Carlson, Equality Utah's public policy director, said Herbert's comments show he doesn't understand how prevalent discrimination is against gay and transgender people in Utah.\n \n \"I agree that we ought to be able to just do the right thing. Unfortunately, the Salt Lake City Human Rights Commission makes it clear that not all employers are doing the right thing,\" he said, referencing a city report released earlier this summer that said discrimination was rampant.\n \n Salt Lake City is considering an anti-discrimination ordinance, but conservative state lawmakers already are eyeing passage of a state law that would trump it.\n \n Herbert reserved judgment on the ordinance until he's had a chance to read it, but said he doesn't like the idea of protected classes in general.\n \n \"Where do you stop? I mean that's the problem going down that slippery road. Pretty soon we're going to have a special law for blue-eyed blondes ... or people who are losing their hair a little bit,\" Herbert said. \"There's some support for about anything we put out there. I'm just saying we end up getting bogged down sometimes with the minutiae of things that government has really no role to be involved in.\"\n \n Carlson said he wants to arrange a meeting with Herbert to help him understand the problems gay Utahns face.\n \n \"We don't have an epidemic of blonde-haired, blue-eyed people getting fired or evicted. We do have a situation where gay and transgender people are being evicted and losing their jobs, not for job performance, but because they're gay or transgender,\" he said.",

I assumed you were going to be consistent...\n \n Let's verbalize this completely...\n The Civil Rights Act of 1964 states that businesses cannot discriminate based on race. They cannot refuse to hire somebody because of their race. They cannot fire somebody (or hold them back in advancement) because of their race.\n Do you support this aspect of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?\n \n If the answer is \"Yes\", then again I apologize cause I assumed you were going to be consistent.\n If the answer is \"No\", then my assessment is 100% accurate because you are excusing racism.\n \n \n \nLet me ask you this: If I own a private business what gives anyone else the right to tell me what my criteria should be for hiring/ firing employees?\n\n Believe it or not, this country is a democracy that protects \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\".\n Our country has LONG AGO RECOGNIZED that gameful employment is a part of \"pursuit of happiness\". As such, denying a person employment based on race is recognized as un-American.\n \n A majority in this country support private businesses being restricted in utilizing some specific forms of bigotry in their employment practices. They have created laws, like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to help restrict those practices in the interests of aiding \"pursuit of happiness\".\n \n Is that clear?\n \n \n \nAlso, where do you draw the line? Can I not hire someone because they dye there hair? Can I establish a dress code for my business and fire those that violate it? What if that dress code prohibits men from wearing dresses?\n\n You ask such arbitrary questions.\n The Civil Rights Act of 1964 lists a very short list of things by which employers cannot discriminate based on. Very short as compared to a much longer list of things they can still actively discriminate based on.\n There is no federal law against employment discrimination based on people dying their hair.\n There is no federal law against employment discrimination based on adherence to a dress code.\n \n You ask \"where do you draw the line\".\n I wonder how it is that you don't recognize that we ALREADY HAVE lines drawn in our existing legislation.\n Since 1964.\n \n \n \nAgreed, there are many good reasons the CVA of 64 passed. Most important was to eliminate discrimination in gov't. ie. Public transportation, school segregation, etc.\n\n Yes, yes, yes...\n I'm sure you would love to obfuscate my point on issues I never broached because they were non-topical to your commentary.\n But can we stick to the specific parts of the CVA of 1964 that are relevant to your commentary?\n \n If you need me to explicitly state something I never even hinted to the contrary of in order to stop you from being distracted, then maybe this will help.\n I explicitly state that you have previously said nothing about other parts of the CVA of 1964. I explicitly acknowledge that you acknowledge some good aspects of the CVA of 1964.\n \n Now, can you address the specific part of the CVA of 1964 which is TOPICAL to your comments?\n The section on employment discrimination prevention.\n Would YOU vote to completely remove that section of the CVA of 1964 that prevents racists from enacting employment discrimination based on race?",

   "First off gays are not part of a special interest group ok Archie? And as far as deserving special rights you can take that comment and shove it.

However, statistics are changing: persecution of Christians is on the increase in the United States.

Officers informed her that such activity is illegal (not true), and that she would be arrested if she continued.

But reminding you of the Holocaust is in no way crying for attention or any kind. But rather showing you that we as a community have died for who we are and continue to struggle for equal rights today.\n \n Or am I assuming too much that you would say the same thing to Jewish victims of the Holocaust as well?

   "I'm sorry. I assumed you were going to be consistent...\n \n Let's verbalize this completely...\n The Civil Rights Act of 1964 states that businesses cannot discriminate based on race. They cannot refuse to hire somebody because of their race. They cannot fire somebody (or hold them back in advancement) because of their race.\n Do you support this aspect of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?\n \n If the answer is \"Yes\", then again I apologize cause I assumed you were going to be consistent.\n If the answer is \"No\", then my assessment is 100% accurate because you are excusing racism.[/B]\n\n \n Pretty sure I was clear on this already but I'll say it again for the cheap seats. No, I don't support those aspects of the CRA. But that doesn't excuse racism in the slightest. Personnaly I find racist disgusting and wouldn't use businesses that practice it. But, just because you and I find it disgusting doesn't mean it should be outlawed.\n \n \nBelieve it or not, this country is a democracy that protects \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\".\n Our country has LONG AGO RECOGNIZED that gameful employment is a part of \"pursuit of happiness\". As such, denying a person employment based on race is recognized as un-American.\n \n A majority in this country support private businesses being restricted in utilizing some specific forms of bigotry in their employment practices. They have created laws, like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to help restrict those practices in the interests of aiding \"pursuit of happiness\".\n \n Is that clear?\n\n \n Always was clear, thank you very much Captain Obvious. But, you didn't answer the question. If a person ownes a private business why should anyone else be able to tell them what they have to use as criteria for hiring and firing? \n \n \nYou ask such arbitrary questions.\n The Civil Rights Act of 1964 lists a very short list of things by which employers cannot discriminate based on. Very short as compared to a much longer list of things they can still actively discriminate based on.\n There is no federal law against employment discrimination based on people dying their hair.\n There is no federal law against employment discrimination based on adherence to a dress code.\n \n You ask \"where do you draw the line\".\n I wonder how it is that you don't recognize that we ALREADY HAVE lines drawn in our existing legislation.\n Since 1964.\n\n \n True, we do currently have lines, however you want them moved. What about the next person/ group who wants them moved? I'll rephrase my question: Where do you draw the final line? Or do we just keep moving it? If a man who thinks he should be a woman comes to work in a dress do you support my right to fire him for violating dress code or should we pass cross-dresser discrimination laws?\n \n \nYes, yes, yes...\n I'm sure you would love to obfuscate my point on issues I never broached because they were non-topical to your commentary.\n But can we stick to the specific parts of the CVA of 1964 that are relevant to your commentary?\n \n If you need me to explicitly state something I never even hinted to the contrary of in order to stop you from being distracted, then maybe this will help.\n I explicitly state that you have previously said nothing about other parts of the CVA of 1964. I explicitly acknowledge that you acknowledge some good aspects of the CVA of 1964.\n \n Now, can you address the specific part of the CVA of 1964 which is TOPICAL to your comments?\n The section on employment discrimination prevention.\n Would YOU vote to completely remove that section of the CVA of 1964 that prevents racists from enacting employment discrimination based on race?\n\n \n Nice rant, pointless and wrong but nicely worded. To answer your question, yes I would vote to remove those sections that applied to privatly owned businesses. I would also sit back and enjoy the slow painful demise of any business that enacted such racist policies.\n This is where you and I disagree on a basic level. I believe people should have the freedoms you advocate taking away. If someone wants to run a business in a racist manner, fine. If you don't like it don't use that business, I sure won't. I'll go to the one next door owned by the gay, black athiest. If someone wants to start a business and hire only gay people, fine. I won't be shopping there either.",

Existed for a long time. I see no real influence in society which would try to make \"whatever way you want to dress\" as a ground for employment protection.\n One of the problems with \"domino theories\" (like your argument presents) is that often there is NO REAL CONNECTION between the dominoes.\n THINK about it.\n We passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which protected race, gender, religion, etc, etc...\n Here we are 45 years later and how many more \"dominoes\" have fallen????\n \n We're talking about sexual orientation, and gender identity.\n FORTY-FIVE YEARS and we only have a couple more items...\n \n There are no connections between the dominoes here.\n \n But to get at the heart of the matter, my position is based on the majority wanting to acknowledge a right of employment which would clearly fall under our founding father documents.\n My position is based on the majority wanting to create laws that a MAJORITY approve of, in a governmental system which claims to respect democracy in a variety of ways.\n \n On your side, you're afraid of what could happen later.\n You want employers to have unquestioned freedom to discriminate.\n \n IMO, you have an inherently weaker position.\n Considering the overwhelming support for ENDA and for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in general, you've got an uphill battle with little traction.\n \n \n \nNice rant, pointless and wrong but nicely worded.\n\n Ahhh.\n Can we take it as read that I feel the same for your commentary and move past pointless pleasantries?\n \n \n \n To answer your question, yes I would vote to remove those sections that applied to privatly owned businesses. I would also sit back and enjoy the slow painful demise of any business that enacted such racist policies.\n\n I think you seriously over-estimate the continued existence of racism in some parts of this country.\n I grew up in a high school that had 2 black kids in it throughout my time there.\n I remember watching people shout racial slurs openly at basketball teams that happened to have black players in them, when we actually played rare schools that had them.\n \n I can't remember if it was this board, but I posted an article about one Southern town which STILL has segregated proms.\n One prom for whites.\n A later prom for everybody else.\n \n I am reminded of many pictures regarding Palin / McCain rallies. Racist signs held high. Racist junk being sold outside the rally.\n \n Churches have no requirement on segregation, and I have posted articles on how incredibly segregated churches are.\n The presence of prejudice against minorities is still very real, and I think you are naive that such businesses wouldn't still be able to thrive.\n \n \n \nThis is where you and I disagree on a basic level. I believe people should have the freedoms you advocate taking away. If someone wants to run a business in a racist manner, fine. If you don't like it don't use that business, I sure won't. I'll go to the one next door owned by the gay, black athiest. If someone wants to start a business and hire only gay people, fine.

I just don't happen to think what behaviors a person will excuse should be a matter of law where it concerns a persons freedom of association.

They always have and to some degree always will. I also believe that those prejudices are not held by the vast majority of people in this country and any business with discriminatory hiring practices would be limited to a very small niche market.\n \n \nAnd historically, obvious problems have demonstrated themselves by your ignoring it attitude.\n \"Black\" hospitals that the ambulance has to drive further to.

It works both ways.\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n I thoroughly disagree.\n A person being unable to find suitable work is THOROUGHLY different from a person being unable to hire discriminately based on gender, race, etc.\n \n In one situation, we're talking about an impact upon a paycheck, or capability to get one.\n In another situation, we're talking about an impact upon a person not being able to implement his/her prejudice.\n \n \n \nOnly those that haven't read it.\n\n Again, you would be wrong on that one...\n But nice guess...\n \n \n \nYou do know we don't live in a democracy, right? The constitution, in particular the ammendments to the constitution (BOR), are designed to put limits on gov't, not people. Under your theory the majority could pass whatever laws they want, sure you want to go down that road?\n\n First, don't get lost on an important distinction I already raised.\n CONSTITUTIONAL restrictions.\n If the people wanted to pass a law making blacks into slaves again, that would violate the constitution. Ergo, it's stopped.\n \n The Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not violate the constitution.\n In many ways, it reaffirms it.\n \n Beyond that, I'm not talking about a \"pure\" democracy.\n Our federal government is more of a republic founded on democratic ideals.\n And it is those democratic ideals I am referencing.\n \n \n \nMore dominoes? You mean like age, pregnancy, marital status, disability, children? You mean like those dominoes? Seems like more than a couple in the last 45 years.\n\n Yes. A few more.\n But over 45 years?\n Relatively a pittance...\n \n \n \nYou're going to have to show me that one before I'll buy it. This would be in direct violation of the CRA of 64, a part of it I agree with btw.\n\n I would assume your agreement would be based on a policy affecting GOVERNMENTAL discrimination, as opposed to \"private sector\" discrimination?\n \n Regardless, here is the link.\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/magazine/24prom-t.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all\n \n I believe the arguments for circumventing such laws (as you specified) revolve around the participants distancing the prom from being a \"legitimate\" school event, and being held more as a \"private\" event.\n Like a private party they just slap the label \"prom\" on. emoticon_frazzled\n \n It's alive and well.\n One thing that racial bigotry should have taught us is that while it is stupid, it is repetitive in its attempts to circumvent the law, if even to be successful to some degree...\n \n \n \nThey would go well with the pictures of racist at Obama rallies, i.e. Black Panther signs and parafinalia. A few nutbars is not an indication of wide spread racism.\n\n Black Panther signs at Obama rallies?\n I am not familiar with that at all.\n Can you document?\n \n Regardless, I think the polls showing 10% would not vote for their own party's qualified candidate, if he were black, as a demonstration that the racism is not just \"a few nutbars\".\n \n \n \nI have now doubt that those prejudices exist. They always have and to some degree always will. I also believe that those prejudices are not held by the vast majority of people in this country and any business with discriminatory hiring practices would be limited to a very small niche market.\n\n Have you ever lived in a small town?\n I did. Growing up in an area where they had a small selection of places to go.\n And worse? I believe such racism is more prevalent in small towns with less exposure to blacks to help provide a \"real life\" example to counter racist stereo-types.\n \n When you only have one or two stores of a specific type, and if one or both discriminated, you are talking about an entire town eliminating entire sectors of employment / service.\n \n \n \nAs I've said I only support repealing the sections that apply to private businesses. I challenge you to find me a hospital, that doesn't accept some form of gov't funding.\n\n I would be careful of that route. Recognize the implications.\n Take the Boy Scouts for example. I agree with the Supreme Court ruling which established they could discriminate as a PRIVATE organization.\n But look at their subsequent head-ache because of unrealized entanglements with the government (including funding, and beyond funding).\n \n \n \nAnd I've seen polls that put it far lower. Goes more to the value of polls than anything else. But lets assume for a moment that 10% is accurate. Do you really think a business would survive when 90% of its customer based disagreed with its hiring practices?\n\n Are you freakin' kidding me? emoticon_frazzled\n There is a difference with \"disagreeing\" with a practice of the business, and actually ACTING UPON that disagreement in the form of a boycott.\n The AFA and similar organizations repeatedly publish the identity of businesses who do not \"share\" their opinions on gay support / gay marriage.\n They publicly ask for people to boycott those businesses.\n \n More people oppose gay marriage in this country than support it.\n Yet despite this disagreement, there is no success in their attempt to boycott, when the percent of people who disagree with gay marriage is MUCH LARGER than 10%.\n \n There is disagreement on an issue.\n And then there is the IMPORTANCE whereby a person will place on that disagreement.\n The two are not equivalent.\n \n \n \nI disagree, I think the vast majority of people in this country have higher standards then you give them credit for.\n\n I don't think you appreciate the fact that \"vast majority\" doesn't equate to \"most people in a specific town\".\n The number of people who are racist in New York City will be much smaller than a small town in Georgia.\n I'm sure blacks will be able to find an \"alternative\" in New York City.\n But living in that small town in Georgia would be significantly impacted.\n \n Racism is not uniformly distributed.\n I refuse to accept a reality whereby a person would be precluded from living in any specific town (operationally precluded) based on their race.\n \n \n \nI disagree I believe most of the advances we have made, as a populace, in this regard would have come anyway. That train was already rolling.\n\n \"Would have come anyways\", but at what rate?\n I reference the above article with the segregated prom.\n I also reference how CHURCHES are still primarily segregated in many areas of the U.S.\n \n \n \nNo, you recognize what you THINK our society would have looked like. I however think it would look very much the same as it does now. I believe the majority of our advances in anti-discrimination have come from changes in peoples attitudes and believes, you can't legislate that.\n\n But WHAT CHANGED those people's attitudes and beliefs???\n Dude. I have GROWN UP around racism.\n It does not change spontaneously.\n If people live their entire life without exposure to the item of their prejudice, then their stereo-types are never challenged.\n \n Think about the big historical picture.\n HOW LONG have those prejudices lived, as opposed to how relatively small the time period is in which they have been so significantly diminished...\n And you think that all just happened spontaneously?\n \n No. It happened because bigotry was prevented from hiding in the dark, and people were dragged into the light. Exposed to the boogeyman of their prejudice, and the younger generation realized that the allegation of the black boogeyman was ridiculous.\n The reason why the anti-gay culture has lost such ground is because gays have courageously came out of the closet and exposed the stereo-types and lies of bigots.\n \n With your way, the cockroaches fester in the dark.\n \n Have you looked at Southern history AFTER many of the laws went into effect?\n There are examples of trials on lynchings, where the white person ADMITTED his guilt, yet a SOUTHERN WHITE jury pronounced the person not guilty.\n I think you under-estimate the dark side of the force of bigotry ...",
