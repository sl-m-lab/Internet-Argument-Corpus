   "http://select.nytimes.com/2006/10/16/opinion/16herbert.html\n \n October 16, 2006\n Op-Ed Columnist\n Why Aren't We Shocked? \n By BOB HERBERT\n \"Who needs a brain when you have these?\" \n \n - message on an Abercrombie & Fitch T-shirt for young women\n \n In the recent shootings at an Amish schoolhouse in rural Pennsylvania and a large public high school in Colorado, the killers went out of their way to separate the girls from the boys, and then deliberately attacked only the girls.\n \n Ten girls were shot and five killed at the Amish school. One girl was killed and a number of others were molested in the Colorado attack.\n \n In the widespread coverage that followed these crimes, very little was made of the fact that only girls were targeted. Imagine if a gunman had gone into a school, separated the kids up on the basis of race or religion, and then shot only the black kids. Or only the white kids. Or only the Jews.\n \n There would have been thunderous outrage. The country would have first recoiled in horror, and then mobilized in an effort to eradicate that kind of murderous bigotry. There would have been calls for action and reflection. And the attack would have been seen for what it really was: a hate crime.\n \n None of that occurred because these were just girls, and we have become so accustomed to living in a society saturated with misogyny that violence against females is more or less to be expected. Stories about the rape, murder and mutilation of women and girls are staples of the news, as familiar to us as weather forecasts. The startling aspect of the Pennsylvania attack was that this terrible thing happened at a school in Amish country, not that it happened to girls.\n \n The disrespectful, degrading, contemptuous treatment of women is so pervasive and so mainstream that it has just about lost its ability to shock. Guys at sporting events and other public venues have shown no qualms about raising an insistent chant to nearby women to show their breasts. An ad for a major long-distance telephone carrier shows three apparently naked women holding a billing statement from a competitor. The text asks, \"When was the last time you got screwed?\"\n \n An ad for Clinique moisturizing lotion shows a woman's face with the lotion spattered across it to simulate the climactic shot of a porn video.\n \n We have a problem. Staggering amounts of violence are unleashed on women every day, and there is no escaping the fact that in the most sensational stories, large segments of the population are titillated by that violence. We've been watching the sexualized image of the murdered 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey for 10 years. JonBenet is dead. Her mother is dead. And we're still watching the video of this poor child prancing in lipstick and high heels.\n \n What have we learned since then? That there's big money to be made from thongs, spandex tops and sexy makeovers for little girls. In a misogynistic culture, it's never too early to drill into the minds of girls that what really matters is their appearance and their ability to please men sexually.\n \n A girl or woman is sexually assaulted every couple of minutes or so in the U.S. The number of seriously battered wives and girlfriends is far beyond the ability of any agency to count. We're all implicated in this carnage because the relentless violence against women and girls is linked at its core to the wider society's casual willingness to dehumanize women and girls, to see them first and foremost as sexual vessels - objects - and never, ever as the equals of men.\n \n \"Once you dehumanize somebody, everything is possible,\" said Taina Bien-Aim\u00e9, executive director of the women's advocacy group Equality Now.\n \n That was never clearer than in some of the extreme forms of pornography that have spread like nuclear waste across mainstream America. Forget the embarrassed, inhibited raincoat crowd of the old days. Now Mr. Solid Citizen can come home, log on to this $7 billion mega-industry and get his kicks watching real women being beaten and sexually assaulted on Web sites with names like \"Ravished Bride\" and \"Rough Sex - Where Whores Get Owned.\"\n \n Then, of course, there's gangsta rap, and the video games where the players themselves get to maul and molest women, the rise of pimp culture (the Academy Award-winning song this year was \"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp\"), and on and on.\n \n You're deluded if you think this is all about fun and games. It's all part of a devastating continuum of misogyny that at its farthest extreme touches down in places like the one-room Amish schoolhouse in normally quiet Nickel Mines, Pa.",

   "I don't think that Simone's post was meant to target all men as being guilty of misogeny. I think it was meant to target everyone in saying the we have all become so accustomed to hearing about misogenous actions that it no longer stirs our compassion to a high degree. I have to admit that, if it was only men that were singled out, or if it was only Gays or people of a particular race, then that event would be so rare in this modern day that it would catch our attention and stir our outrage. I have to admit that violent acts against women are so common that we have largely become uninterested in such stories - just like stories of gang murders, etc.\n \n The question I would address is \"Why don't we care more?\". Is it because we only pay attention to those violent acts which are rare and, therefore, interesting or is it because we have less concern for women's lives and dignity than that of men of various races and sexual persuasions. I think that it is a mixture of both but more the former than the later for most people. That is not true, of course, for those people who truly are misogenistic.",

On paper, it's a democracy with woman sufferage. I've even seen them vote. \n As for SA, I think that we need to deal with them harsher, no doubt. It's Saudi money that has funded world-wide Wahabbist and they should have to account for that.",

   "Sartre, you are totally out in left field, you are out there in LaLaLand:\n \n http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=32693\n \n Iraq: Saddam Better for Women\n Sanjay Suri\n LONDON, Mar 29 (IPS) - Women were far better off under former Iraq dictator Saddam Hussein, a women's group has found after an extensive survey in Iraq. \n \n ''Under the previous dictator regime, the basic rights for women were enshrined in the constitution,'' Houzan Mahmoud from the Organisation of Women's Freedom in Iraq told IPS in an interview. The group is a sister organization of MADRE, an international women's rights group. \n \n Under Saddam, she said, ''women could go out to work, university and get married or divorced in civil courts. But at the moment women have lost almost all their rights and are being pushed back into the corner of their house.'' \n \n The recent constitution which was written under the U.S. government's supervision is ''very backward and anti-women,'' Mahmoud said. ''They make Islam the source for law making, and the main official religion of the country. This in itself means Islamic Sharia law and according to this women will be considered second-class citizens and will have no power in deciding over their lives.'' \n \n The whole of Iraqi society has been subjected to ''chaos and brutalisation,'' she said. ''Security is absent, all basic services, and above all the protection for women's rights is in no way on the agenda of any of the political parties who have been hand-picked by the U.S. administration in the installed so-called parliament.'' \n \n MADRE is calling for the deployment of a United Nations-led peacekeeping force and an immediate end to the U.S. occupation. As the crisis in Iraq intensifies, the group says women and their families in Iraq face an urgent need for security, functional government, and the provision of basic services within a human rights framework. \n \n Over three years of occupation, the situation is becoming more dangerous and bleak with the presence of the occupying forces, and ''the more violence and terrorism is in function in Iraq the more women will fall victims of such climate,'' she said. \n \n ''The rape, abduction, abuse in prisons by prison guards, and killing of women is widespread,'' she said. ''The lack of security and proper protection for women is a major issue and no one, neither the occupying forces nor the local police of the puppet regime. is doing anything about it.'' \n \n But the position of women does vary within Iraq, she said. ''In the Kurdish part the situation of women is slightly better because Iraqi Kurdistan was out of the hands of the Ba'ath regime from 1991, so it was not part of the U.S. military attacks in 2003. But the attitude towards women is not progressive there.'' \n \n Beyond any dangers from the political situation, ''a lot of so- called 'honour killings' are still taking place, and the Kurdish authorities are not doing much to prevent it from happening.'' \n \n But the south is directly under daily military occupation ''and the presence of various Islamic armed militias who are terrorising women has made their situation worse,'' Mahmoud said. ''Also, the so-called parliament is divided on the bases of religious sects and ethnic backgrounds, so the majority of Shiittes who are in power are institutionalising women's oppression and are systematically forcing Islamification on Iraq.'' \n \n Women are 60 percent of the population of Iraq but they are not being consulted on any political issues and are being deprived of this right, she said. \n \n The presence of a few women should not mislead people on the situation of women, she said. ''The U.S. administration has handpicked a few women and imposed them on people in the so-called parliament,'' she said. ''These women are very unknown to Iraqi women. Most of them belong to the reactionary right wing parties in power and they follow their agenda, which is discriminatory against women.'' \n \n Women would first like to see ''an end to the military occupation which has created chaos and destruction of Iraqi society and also resulted in the daily mass killing of ordinary Iraqis.'' \n \n Women particularly would ''want to see security restored so at least they can go out freely without being attacked, kidnapped or having acid thrown on their face,'' Mahmoud said. ''In addition, women want equality, freedom and their rights to be recognised in the constitution, and above all to be treated as equal human beings.''",

   "Sartre, you are totally out in left field, you are out there in LaLaLand:\n\n \n Oh really? I might make the same claim about you.\n \n\n Human Rights Watch believes that many of the acts of the Iraqi government's systematic repression of the Marsh Arabs constitute a crime against humanity. The crimes were committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of the Marsh Arabs during the decade of the 1990s.2 The attack involved the multiple commissions of acts in furtherance of state policy. The underlying crimes include:\n \n Murder of thousands of unarmed civilians following the abortive March 1991 uprising, through summary execution and the indiscriminate bombardment and shelling of residential areas in towns and villages in the vicinity of Basra, al-Nasiriyya, al-`Amara and across the marshes region; \n \n Forcible population transfer-coercive expulsion of part of the Marsh Arab population from their native villages to settlements on dry land on the outskirts of the marshes and along major highways to facilitate government control over them; \n \n Arbitrary and prolonged imprisonment of thousands who had been arrested during and in the aftermath of military bombardment of residential areas in the marshes, including civilians and others suspected of anti-government activities; \n \n Torture of Marsh Arab detainees held in government custody, in order to extract information from them, as punishment, and as a means to spread fear among the local population; \n \n Enforced disappearances of many of the Marsh Arabs arrested during the 1990s, whose fate and whereabouts remain unresolved to date; \n \n Persecution of the Marsh Arabs through the intentional and severe deprivation of their fundamental rights on the basis of their religious and political identity as a group.\n \n Human Rights Watch calls on the government of Iraq to immediately release Marsh Arabs who remain in detention; to clarify the fate and whereabouts of those who \"disappeared\" following arrest; and to compensate the victims and the families of those who were arbitrarily held, tortured, \"disappeared,\" or executed. The perpetrators of the crimes against the Marsh Arabs should be brought to justice.\n \n Introduction: Repression of the Shi'a \n \n The Iraqi government's assault on the Marsh Arabs has occurred against the backdrop of its repression of the Shi'a Muslim population of the country as a whole. This repression has been as relentless and as brutal as that visited on the Kurds in the north. Discrimination against Iraqi Shi'a, who represent an estimated 60 to 65 percent of the country's population, has been rooted in the country's political history. \n \n The fate of the Shi'a as a target of government repression was sealed following the February 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran. The Iraqi government, motivated by fears that revolution in Iran would spur its own Shi'a population to revolt, lost no time in mounting a repressive campaign. At the end of 1979 and in early 1980, thousands of people were arrested in various towns and cities in central and southern Iraq, apparently on suspicion of supporting the Islamic revolution or for having links with the new regime in Iran. Many of these persons have since \"disappeared\" in custody and remain unaccounted for. Others died under torture or were executed. \n \n This campaign of arrests was swiftly followed by another, more ambitious campaign: the forced expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Shi'a Muslims to Iran, the official justification being that they were of Iranian origin (taba'iyya). More than half a million Shi'a Muslims, at the very least, were systematically expelled over the course of the 1980s. They included large numbers of women, children, and the elderly. The male heads of these families, together with other younger male relatives, were arrested and imprisoned indefinitely without charge: most remain unaccounted for today. These measures were accompanied by the promulgation of discriminatory legislation against Shi'a Muslims, the introduction of retroactive death penalty legislation for membership in a Shi'a Muslim opposition group Islamic Call (al-Da'wa al-Islamiyya), and the execution in prison and targeted assassination of prominent religious leaders and scholars.\n \n Another wave of repression followed an abortive March 1991 uprising in southern Iraq after Iraq's defeat in the Gulf war. Civilians across the country, as well as some armed opposition forces, had taken part in widespread anti-government activities. Iraqi authorities rounded up thousands of people suspected of having participated in the three-week insurrection in numerous cities, towns, and villages across southern Iraq. As Human Rights Watch described it in a 1992 report: \"In their attempt to retake cities, and after consolidating control, loyalist forces killed thousands of unarmed civilians by firing indiscriminately into residential areas; executing young people on the streets, in homes and in hospitals; rounding up suspects especially young men, during house-to-house searches, and arresting them without charge or shooting them en masse; and using helicopters to attack unarmed civilians as they fled the cities.\"3 The fate and whereabouts of many of those who \"disappeared\" in custody remains unresolved to date. \n http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/mena/marsharabs1.htm\n \n\n \n \n\n After Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 - when the Security Council placed Iraq under economic sanctions (through resolution 661) - and the 1991 Gulf War, the country's economy plummeted. Women were severely affected in all areas of their lives, including physical and psychological health, the burden of their domestic responsibilities, their economic status, and their marital life. At the same time, the government in Baghdad brutally cracked down on any signs of dissent to consolidate its hold on power, and women - whether because they had family members suspected of dissent or because they were oppositionists in their own right - were harassed, imprisoned, \"disappeared\", tortured, beaten, raped and executed, or lost their husbands, sons and brothers to similar treatment. Hussein also attempted to maintain legitimacy after the Gulf War by appeasing religious fundamentalists and other conservatives, bringing in anti-woman legislation such as a 1990 presidential decree granting immunity to men who committed honour crimes. More than 4,000 women were victims of this law.. In contrast, the semi-autonomy of Kurds in Iraq's three northern governorates (Iraqi Kurdistan) allowed women to take great political strides forward during the 1990s. In 2003, two of the 26 cabinet members in the Kurdistan Regional Government were women, and women occupied numerous posts among ministry staff.\n .....\n However, despite the difficulty and the very real danger, Iraqi women persisted in striving to participate in and influence the political process by holding regional meetings, conducting concerted advocacy campaigns, meetings with UN envoy and Elections Advisory team, and efforts to increase nominations by women for posts in the transitional cabinet and the Independent Electoral Commission. Positive results of their work included overturning the Iraqi Governing Council's controversial Resolution 137, (which would have \"canceled\" Iraqi family laws and moved family issues from civil to religious jurisprudence, where they would be governed by Sharia law), obtaining language on gender equality and a 25% goal for women's legislative representation enshrined in the Transitional Administrative Law, and in June 2004, having six women named to the 30-member transitional cabinet and two to the nine-member Electoral Commission.\n \n The first post-war government was elected in January 2005 and was hailed as a success for women's political participation: women made up 31% of the new National Assembly (which will draft the new constitution), exceeding the target of 25% representation by women outlined in the Transitional Administrative Law. At the same time, significant differences of opinion remained regarding how the new constitution and legislation would deal with women's rights, with even female MPs divided about whether they should be liberalized or brought more in line with Sharia law. \n ...\n The Fedayeen Saddam militia publicly beheaded at least 130 (and up to 2000) women from June 2000 to April 2001 on charges of prostitution, which was decreed a crime punishable by death during the 1990s. While some of the women may have been prostitutes, most were associated, either through family connections or personally, with some sort of opposition to the government. According to one report, among the women beheaded were two television presenters and 80 gyn\u00e6cologists and midwives. The heads were often left on the doors or doorsteps of the women's families, who were required to display them in public view. \n \n In 2001, Amnesty International declared Iraq to have the world's worst record of disappearances. In 2003, the UN Secretary-General reported that \"over the past three decades, at least 290,000 Iraqis from all religious groups, ethnic groups, political affiliations, classes and professions disappeared.\" more... Over 200,000 Iraqi men, women, and children were disappeared. Kidnappings of women, mostly the wives and daughters of dissidents, were reported across Iraq. The women were said to be at the service of their kidnappers and senior government officials.\n http://www.womenwarpeace.org/iraq/iraq.htm \n\n \n Until Iraq's police force has re-established the rule of law, Iraq will be a dangerous place for everyone, particularly young men. The new constitution has been written such that women will enjoy the same rights as their male counterparts. This was discontinued by SH after the Gulf War. The majority of starvations during the years between the Gulf Wars were women and children. Up to 1 Million Iraqi children alone starved to death during that period. Do you really think that anyone is worse off in Iraq today than back then? emoticon_wow",

Typically, he murdered young women and girls by bludgeoning them, and sometimes by strangulation.\n",

   "From Wikipedia:\n \n \nAileen Carol Wuornos (born Aileen Carol Pittman) (February 29, 1956 - October 9, 2002) was an American prostitute and serial killer who was sentenced to death by the state of Florida in 1992. She ultimately received five additional death sentences. Wuornos admitted to killing seven men, in separate incidents, all of whom she claimed raped her (or attempted to) whilst she was working as a prostitute. She was put to death via lethal injection on October 9, 2002.\n \n Aileen Carol Wuornos was born in Rochester, Michigan, to Diane Wuornos and Leo Dale Pittman. Her father, Leo Dale Pittman, whom she never knew, was a psychopathic child molester who served time in Kansas and Michigan mental hospitals. He hung himself in 1969 while in prison. Wuornos's mother, Diane, married Pittman when she was 15 and bore him two children. Aileen Wuornos's older brother, Keith, was born in 1955. Aileen was born in 1956. Diane divorced Pittman less than two years into their marriage, a few months before Aileen was born. Diane abandoned Aileen and her brother Keith in 1960, leaving them in the care of their Finnish-born grandparents Lauri and Britta Wuornos, who raised them in Troy, Michigan. Lauri and Britta legally adopted the two children.\n \n Wuornos claimed that Lauri physically and sexually abused her as a child and Britta was an abusive alcoholic. In Lethal Intent, Sue Russell wrote that Wuornos was whipped with a belt by Lauri. At the age of twelve, Wuornos and her brother Keith discovered that Lauri and Britta were not their biological parents.\n \n Wuornos became pregnant at age fourteen. She also claimed to have had sex with multiple partners at a young age, including her brother Keith. Upon giving birth to her child at a Detroit maternity home on March 23, 1971, she was banished from her family home and disowned by the community. Subsequently her child was put up for adoption soon after birth. Wuornos was forced to take shelter in an abandoned car in the woods. Soon after she was sent to a home for unwed mothers.\n",

I find it XXXX that you seem to think that the victims were selected due to the supposed \"general misogynistic attitude\" that men share in America. Serial killers and mass murderers select their victims based on deeply rooted psychological issues. If you think you can jump in and untangle the psyche of these 2 killers or murderers in general, I wish you luck in doing what thousands of psychiatrists, psychologists, and criminologists have been unable to do for the last thousand + years. \n \n However, I don't see the need for \"additional outrage\" soley based on the fact that these were simply little girls.
