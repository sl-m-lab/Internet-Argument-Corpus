   "Most americans support a Federal Marriage Amendment. Defining Marriage as a union between a man and a woman.\n \n Federal Marriage Amendment\n \n \n This is the text of the Amend:\n \n Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman. Neither this constitution or the constitution of any state, nor state or federal law, shall be construed to require that marital status or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon unmarried couples or groups.\n\n \n I get a big laugh whenever the Christian Reich tries something like this. They go on about the \"Traditional\" definition of what a marriage is. Well, they don't even know it themselves, or choose to remember it \"differently\". Even in the bible it shows how god ordered Abraham to take another wife.\n \n For those who want to go back to the original \"traditional\" definition of marriage you're also going to have to take all of the rights away from women as well (Though, they are working on that already). Traditionally (As in the bible as well) marriage is a contract for the purchase of a bride. As you all know women were considered to be nothing more than property for many thousands of years and like livestock had no say at all, least of all whom she would marry. There is nothing sacred about marriage. The sacred part is the wedding, and that isn't even traditionally a Christian rite either. They get that from the Jews and the Pagans.\n \n You can get married without having ANYTHING at all to do with any religion and it is perfectly legal, but if you only have a wedding in a church without a valid marriage license then you are not legally married.",

   "Ever wonder why the world was hit with a virus called HIV? AKA AIDS\n Seems once the Homosexual thing got bigger, we got hit with this AIDS thing, if I recall AIDS first hit the world in the 1960's, there was a virus that homosexuals were getting that nobody knew what it was, later they called it HIV/AIDS. \n And yes the first person on earth to get Aids was a homosexual, tell me that Strait people get it and I'll tell yea that the first person that got HIV that was strait got AIDS threw a blood transfusion from a homosexual that had aids, didn't take to long and AIDS went threw the US and rest of the world.\n\n \n Actually no, the very first cases of HIV/AIDS was found to have come from Africa. They had said that it was first most likely transmitted to humans through the bite of a monkey (SIV). There's that Evilution thing again. :)\n \n \nI guess its in our nature to kill ourselves right? When you Homo's are in hell maybe then you will realize that your open minded gay XXX lifestyle was wrong.\n\n \n Guess what, we're all Homo's, even you.

I don't have anything against satanism. Satanists are not the people that go around chopping up german shepards in the woods as they are portrayed on television.

The wackos that do that kind of XXXX make me sick, of course. \n \n You are not looking down on all minorities, that is good. But what you are advocating is supressing the rights of one minority group based on what you perceive to be traditional values. What is the true meaning of marriage? I would say it is the expression of love and the desire to commit totally to one person for the rest of your life. Marriage itself does not make you desire to have children. As you stated, people can have children without being married. People can live together without being married. So why do we do it? \n \n Why don't you agree with people who are not married having children...or people getting married and not having children? It is a choice. Don't you think people should have the right to make choices, especially choices about their lives?
