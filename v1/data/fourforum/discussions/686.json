Once the \"social ill\" is removed, utopian thinking goes, everyone with change/revert back to/evolve into some perfect 'superman' and conflicting ideas will cease.\n \n All of these utopian ideas; communism, anarchy, socialism, etc., fail to recognize man's foilables. Interestingly enough, religion recognizes man's imperfection, and also promises to correct them, just not on this level of existance. But is does promise some change in behavior for its adherants (and this is true both for monotheistic and politheistic religions) .\n \n But the worst crimes in history prior to the 20th Century were committed when attempts to merge the two were made - the Inquisitions, Wahabiist Islamic slaughters, and the various Caste wars in India occured when the promises of a perfect existance later were tried to be forced to exist upon Earth. And they failed at the cost of untold millions of lives. \n \n The 20th Century brings us Godless utopianist efforts, and the murder rate for their attempts to force man to perfect himself were the worst yet. \n \n I think the real problem is man's own refusal to recognize he isn't perfectable here on Earth, irregardless of religious beliefs.\n \n Peace, Tom",

   "Speed or any quanta for that matter can only be defined by giving reference to a point in timespace. For the sake of science this point is known as the observer. Well newtonian physics was fine it worked well in defineing everything relitive to the earth sun or other objects common to us all. We were not forced to think of ourselves as unique observers. Dear old Einstine made it much more personal. The 300 000m/s of light has to be relitive to something or else you can not say that is the speed.\n \n So in the modern era we return to Lao Tzu and the concept of duality. Relationships. It is truly wierd do not shoot the messanger. Light always stays the same speed. It does not matter who is the observer. Even the speed of the source is not relevent.\n \n We know that E=MC2 means light energy= Matter. The C2 bit denotes the relationship. That is matter is energy locked up in the temporal state of thermol dynamics. So it is a very weird world indeed. Energy contained by Fields of energy locked up in the laws of the time space continume.\n \n My point is thier is no ultamate truth. We are unique observers and everything is relitive to our own properties with in the continume. No matter what ship your in moon your on planet your on light will always travel for you at 300 000m/s. To people moving away from each other at a fraction of that speed will see the speed of light travel at 300 000m/s. Light refuses to speed up or slow down no matter how fast you run at it. It only makes sence if we live in our own uneique universe. Billions of observers means billions of differnt realites.\n \n The special thing is how we meat up in this place. The way we interact. The common source of DNA. The way we work together to build citys and nations. This thing we call culture seems to escape scientific observation. The spirit of the nation superseeds any one man. This lust for God and meaning. Mortality and how we can ignore it in our persute of love. The emotions of man have the ability to prepell us into the etherial.\n \n What is it to be man? What is it to be? Is our internal world a reflection of the external or is the external world a reflection of the internal? The gene pool and bioligy suggests we are temporal manifestaions of the same thing. Points of the same energy seperated by the illusion of space time. What is Love? does this thing that binds lovers bind the universe. The love of a mother for a child has no qanta regardless the oberver. \n \n This is an interactive programme we are all programmers. The human condition of helplessness is to blame for our ills. We have a direct relationship to our environment. When you smile at someone they cant help it they smile back. They cant help it they have to. Its hard wired like yauning. Smile at someone and not only do you get a shot of dopamine they do to. The world is an amazing place. Utopia can be found with in.",
