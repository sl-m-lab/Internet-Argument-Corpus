Indeed, to them the perception is reality.\" (Emphasis in original.) In other words, Mr. Reagan knew that Martin Luther King was, in reality, unworthy of national adulation. Nonetheless, on November 2, 1983, he put his signature on the bill and the holiday became law.\"\n http://www.thenewamerican.com/tna/1999/01-04-99/king_myth.htm\n \n In fact, Reagan was opposed to the civil rights movement...\n \"This is amazing because during the 50s and 60s, the Right almost unanimously opposed the civil rights movement. Contrary to the claims of many neocons, the opposition was not limited to the John Birch Society and southern conservatives. It was made by politicians like Ronald Reagan and Barry Goldwater, and in the pages of Modern Age, Human Events, National Review, and the Freeman.\"\n http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/epstein9.html",

Nevertheless, he set the stage for the illegal activities of others by encouraging and, in general terms, ordering support of the contras during the October 1984 to October 1986 period when funds for the contras were cut off by the Boland Amendment, and in authorizing the sale of arms to Iran, in contravention of the U.S. embargo on such sales. The President's disregard for civil laws enacted to limit presidential actions abroad -- specifically the Boland Amendment, the Arms Export Control Act and congressional-notification requirements in covert-action laws -- created a climate in which some of the Government officers assigned to implement his policies felt emboldened to circumvent such laws.\"",

More higher paying jobs, taxes that are lower here and housing that's reasonably priced are a few reasons.\n\n \n I've lived in Canada my whole life, here's my perspective on the USA. Nice place to visit, wouldn't want to live there.\n \n I know ONE guy that would LIKE to live in the US. EVERYONE ELSE would never move there unless they had to for career reasons. My next door neighbor is a doctor, he took a job down there because the offer was too good to refuse. He'll work his 10-20 years and retire in Canada. I know others that have had to go to Houston due to the being the center of the US oil business. Same reason.\n \n I know several people who have gone to school or taken jobs down there out of university, everywhere from Boston, to Wisconsin, to Iowa, ALL could not wait to return to Canada.\n \n I do have one friend that moved to West Virginia. His older brother married into old money while playing hockey at Princeton on a full scholarship. He's on easy street, but still misses Canada.\n \n I've never to been to the Windsor/Detroit area, and I don't doubt your assertion that for some, the grass is greener on the other side of the 49th, but I'm guessing that bridge has some two traffic. \n \n HOWEVER.\n \n To suggest that most Canadians would give up their life savings to live in the USA, as you've stated JP, is absolutely absurd, and only goes to reinforce the arrogant sterotype that's already being discussed.\n \n Waxy",

While I know plenty of Canadians that would love to be permanent US residents, I know at least as many who love Canada. It IS a beautiful country.

   "It's not a true stereotype I feel, because every single American I has met has not been like that. But then they have all been those who are willing to travel abroad, so maybe they are different to the norm?\n\n \n From my American point of view I normally enjoy Americans who have or do travel out of choice, not in a tour group, here and outside the US. I find a large majority of people who have not traveled, and I include most overseas military service in that majority, seem to live in a smaller intellectual world. Opinionated doesn't entirely service the definition but I consider them (not all) unable to easily grasp different conditions, thoughts, beliefs and other 'foreign' things outside of their experience. This extends to people from different regions and obviously encompasses most countries, not just the US. When not on his home turf, I've found women much more adaptable than men, many Americans traveling in groups do express an aggressiveness not found in most travelers. A shrink friend said it's insecurity and very common do to the fact most Americans have had 'you're the greatest' pounded into their heads from childhood on and they're in unfamiliar circumstances. Let's face facts; we have a standing president who took us to war on false pretenses and then turned the situation around in American minds to humanitarianism because it was 'right' and the American way. Flag waving removes common sense and reason from many of us.",
