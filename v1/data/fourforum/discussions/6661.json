Soviet russia was so far removed from the communist ideals of equality as contemporary Russia. Power, wealth and influence was concentrated in a precious elite... In fact, it`s probably the same elite that rules Russia today. I can`t think of any Soviet benefits over US-style democracy, apart from the societ educational system (but that`s not even entirely a political issue).",

It was a totalitarian socialist state.\n \n Communisim is a purely theoretical concept. It has never been tried. Under cummunism, everybody just kind of does the job they like and gets whatever they need to get by. In theory, very appealing. Every time it has been tried, it has resulted in a bunch of poor people, a bloodbath, and a ton of corrution.\n \n Since communism is pretty much a failed system of ideals, I owudl go with a democratic republic, but NOT like we have in the US.
