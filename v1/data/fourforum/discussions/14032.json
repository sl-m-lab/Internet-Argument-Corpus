   "While I'm quick to criticize Obama's socialist tendencies, I also praise him when it warrants it.\n \n \n\n CIA director: US efforts disrupting al-Qaida \n By TIM TALLEY\n The Associated Press \n Monday, March 8, 2010; 6:39 PM \n \n NORMAN, Okla. -- CIA Director Leon Panetta said Monday the country's counterterrorism operations have placed al-Qaida's top leaders under extreme pressure and many are \"on the run\" but recent thwarted terror plots in the U.S. indicate the terror network is changing its tactics. \n \n \"We are a nation at war with al-Qaida and its associates. And that war is persistent,\" Panetta said during a foreign policy conference at the University of Oklahoma. \"They remain determined to kill as many Americans as possible.\" \n \n Counterterrorism operations directed at al-Qaida in recent months have led to the deaths of more than half of the terrorist group's top 20 leaders, Panetta said. Many of the operations were conducted in tribal areas of Pakistan that were once considered an al-Qaida safe haven, he said. \n \"Our counterterrorism operations have put senior al-Qaida leaders under intense pressure,\" Panetta said. \"We are effectively conducting operations that disrupt the work of al-Qaida, that disrupt their command and control. \n \n \"But this is also a war. And they will keep coming at us any way we can.\" \n washingtonpost.com \n\n \n Nice job, Prez! emoticon_xkill",
