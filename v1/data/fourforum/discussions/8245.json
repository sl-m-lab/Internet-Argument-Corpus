   "Yeah. Others have tried to actually \"link\" gay marriage to a downfall of straight marriage. It's a load of b.s.\n \n 1) Any decline in marriage statistics in countries that have gay marriage started a LONG TIME BEFORE gay marriage ever occurred in those countries.\n \n 2) Typically, people who try to claim that gay marriage has negatively impacted marriage in a country are cherry-picking the data. They'll give you numbers from 1995 to 2003, but then refuse to tell you that the statistic has gone up EVERY YEAR AFTER that...\n \n 3) Lee Badgett does an excellent job of refuting a lot of their b.s.\n Here's a link to a summary of her paper, although the original is much better...\n I'm still trying to find a web-site that has it on there...\n \n http://www.contemporaryfamilies.org/subtemplate.php?t=pressReleases&ext=July13-\n \n Addendum: Found a PDF version of it.

For example:\n \n From Colson's article:\n For thirty years I have been going into prisons across America. It has been a wonderful opportunity to share Christ, but it has also been depressing to watch the prison population explode at the same time: When I left prison thirty years ago, there were 239,000 inmates-now there are 2.3 million in America.\n Clearly, his 30 years of visiting prisons has caused the explosion in the prison population.

Probably close to the same percentage. Other than Massachusetts, gays are not allowed to marry in the USA.

   "Actually, I think it's probably the most compelling argument I've read for the amendment. The be fair, I don't think the author is claiming there is a direct link between gay marriage and crime. He seems to be talking about overall effect on society and traditional family. But I'm still against the amendment; amending the constitution over something like this is just not the right thing to do.\n\n You're joking right? Compelling? Here's what his argument consists of:\n 1) I see that a lot of people in prison come from broken homes\n 2) Therefore there should not be gay marriage\n \n There is absolutely no connection made between the two. It's an absurd, alarmist argument. The whole purpose of the argument is to put \"rising prison population\" and \"gay marriage\" in the same sentence and make people associate the two when they have nothing to do with one another.",

   "BOSTON - If blue states care less about moral values, why are divorce rates so low in the bluest of the blue states? It's a question that intrigues conservatives, as much as it emboldens liberals. \n \n As researchers have noted, the areas of the country where divorce rates are highest are also frequently the areas where many conservative Christians live.\n \n Kentucky, Mississippi and Arkansas, for example, voted overwhelmingly for constitutional amendments to ban gay marriage. But they had three of the highest divorce rates in 2003, based on figures from the Census Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics.\n \n The lowest divorce rates are largely in the blue states: the Northeast and the upper Midwest. And the state with the lowest divorce rate was Massachusetts, home to John Kerry, the Kennedys and same-sex marriage.\n \n In 2003, the rate in Massachusetts was 5.7 divorces per 1,000 married people, compared with 10.8 in Kentucky, 11.1 in Mississippi and 12.7 in Arkansas.\n \n \"Some people are saying, 'The Bible Belt is so pro-marriage, but gee, they have the highest divorce rates in the country,' \" said Barbara Dafoe Whitehead, co-director of the National Marriage Project at Rutgers University. \"And there's a lot of worry in the red states about the high rate of divorce.\"\n http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/14/weekinreview/14pamb.html?ex=1258174800&%2338;en=4f927c5f27fb9966&%2338;ei=5090&\n \n \n Sooo.\n If we're worried about \"marriage\" and \"crime\", as the article at the start of this thread ponders, how about we prevent the red states from marrying to prevent divorce?\n Make sense?",
