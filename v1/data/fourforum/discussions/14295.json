   "All new air guns to be licensed - Herald Scotland | News | Politics\n \n \nKenny MacAskill, the Justice Secretary, told the annual conference of the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents in Dunblane that new air rifles or pistols would be subject to a licensing scheme.\n \n Firearms have traditionally been a reserved matter, but the Scottish Government has pushed for years for the power to tighten regulations on the issue.\n \n The recent Calman Commission recommended that the powers on air weapons be transferred to the Scottish Parliament and the new UK Government has said it will implement the recommendations in full.\n \n The move follows the death of two-year-old Andrew Morton, killed five years ago with an airgun pellet shot by Mark Bonini, 27, in Glasgow's east end.\n \n Three Scots have died and more than 1100 have been injured by airguns in the last 10 years.\n \n Bonini was jailed for at least 13 years and since then UK legislation on air weapons has been tightened. The minimum age for owning an airgun has risen from 17 to 18, mail-order sales have been banned and all retailers must now be registered.\n \n However, Scottish ministers and police believe Scotland still needs to do more to tackle the country's problems with air weapons.\n \n MacAskill said: \"We will establish a Scottish Firearms Consultative Panel. One of the objectives of the panel will be to look at establishing a pilot licensing scheme for air weapons. This will enable us to test the practicalities of air weapon licensing.\n \n \"It will also test whether or not a licensing system can operate effectively without wider reform of the firearms legislation.\n \n \"While our primary concern is for public safety, we are clear that any licensing system must be workable for the police and all involved.\n \n \"This includes looking at the funding issues. We will work closely with the Consultative Panel to ensure this is the case.\n \n \"We have a problem with air weapons in Scotland that needs to be tackled. The pilot will be for new sales of air weapons rather than those languishing in people's lofts.\"\n \n MacAskill's previous call for a summit aimed at reforming gun legislation was rejected by former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, who said it was \"not timely\" and repeated requests for airgun licensing to be devolved were rebutted by the previous UK Government.\n \n MacAskill yesterday also announced \u00a3300,000 in funding for police forces to roll out the Tayside pilot project allowing, in specific cases where a risk was posed to children, the disclosure of sex offender details.\n \n And he said he would look at concerns raised by the superintendents about the need to increase the traditional six-hour detention period for suspects if they were unable to be questioned due to drink or drugs.\n \n In relation to calls for an extension to the six-hour detention period, MacAskill said: \"It is in all of our interests to ensure that the police have at their disposal robust procedures which enable them to investigate crime effectively. \n \n \"Where changes are needed, changes will be made. I do not view these matters as ideological but operational. If officers need powers on DNA, detention or whatever then we are happy to consider them and do what's right.\"\n \n MacAskill continued: \"We are happy to look at this with the Crown and defence lawyers.\n \n \"It is common sense that if someone is blind drunk they are not capable of being interviewed. There is something perverse about the idea of someone sobering up after five hours 55 minutes and then being released. The obligation of government is to try to find a solution and that is what we will seek to do.\"\n\n \n Very interesting. In a country with tough gun control laws, it's apparently not tough enough. I guess all their bans and prohibitions are simply too impotent to do a damn bit of good.",
