He has on occasion called us godless people, a nation of decaying morals, claimed that we are a nation of criminals and that we respected no law.

He was pointing out that America is a corrupt place, run by corrupt people, and they they had no place trying to control other countries.\n \n As far as how to stop them, I for one would advocate pulling our troops out of the ME and ending our involvement there. The things I see America doing in the ME are not things I think America should be doing anyway. We are allowing israel to continue thier current real estate and racial policies, in violation of international law. We are supporting the Saudi government, inarguably the most totalitarin government on the planet, even more totalitarin that N korea. We initiated years of sanctions against Iraq, which lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children and elderly (the two most suceptable age groups).\n \n I don't think we should do this because we were attacked, I think we should do it because it is the right thing to do. I am in complete agreement with Bin Laden on this particular point. America has no business involving itself in the ME in such a manner. If we want to involve ourselves in the ME in some kind of positive light, one that is not positive to American corporations but detrimental to the indigenous people, that would be fine. There are dozens of foreign firms in the ME right now, and many countires that have diplomatic ties there. The Us has been singled out as the bad guys because of our cut throat policies. \n \n As far as \"giving in\" (which in this case means the same as \"admitting we were wrong\"), I think negotiation is definatly in order. You cannot crush a large, well armed terrorist movement with your military. I don't know why this is so hard for people to get through their heads. It has never worked in the past, and will most likely never work int he future. As much as some hate to admit it, the only way that large, well organised terrorist organisations have ever been \"beaten\" is by sittin down with them as you would another nation and negotiating an end to the violence. The only reason I can see for peoples refusal to accept this is American arrogance, the arrogance of a failing empire. People are so sure that America is the greates country int he world, so sure of our military and cultural superiority, that they are blinded from the truth.\n \n I think we saw a similar phenomenon during the Vietnam war. Richard Nixon stood on the white house steps and said \"Victory in South East asia is assured\" even as their flag flew over our embassy. He wasn't lying, he honestly believed it. I think most of America believed it. As a nation, we were so sure of our power ans superiority that we were certain that a little ragtag bunch of guerilla fighters in the jungles of vietnam couldn't beat us. We were wrong. Those who don't believe we can be beat by the terrorists today are wrong. It can happen, and if we don't revise our game plan, it will happen.\n \n \n Back to the topic, I have yet to see Bin Laden say he was plannign ot invade America. he has not claimed he wishes to change the basis of American culture or government at all. He has always claimed that his aim was to get America to change our foreign policy. \n \n I have had some people tell me he is lying about his goals, or that he has no goals, or that he jst wants to kill. The village idiot gave a speach I believe yesterday at the air force academy in which he claimed that America was not being attacked becasue they hate our policies, Ameirca was being attacked becasue they hate our existance.\n \n I will admit that if the president is going to give a speech where he says something that idiotic, the best place for it would be at a military function where people are forced to stand at attention and can be ordered to clap. \n \n They are obviosly attacking us for some reason. acking other evidence, I think it is safe to take everything after Bin Laden says \"We are attacking america because\" and say that those are the reasons. it would make no sense at all for him to lie about the reasons or about what they want. if they lied about what they want, they would certainly never get it. \n \n So, going on the basis that what they want is a change in US foreign policy and not to invade the US and proclaim himself king of North America, it would certianly seem that America is the one in this situation who subscribes to the Nazi doctorine of invasion and forcing your culture and government down peoples throat. \n \n Even in cases where we don't send our military in to forcibly overthrow the government, but instead participate in coups where we install our own handpicked tyrant puppet to the seat of power, thisis still mroe or less invasion, just a sneak attack instead of a full military intervention. when we attach trade agreements that give US companies priority in ohter nations in return for grain to feed your draught sticken people, this is still an invasion.\n \n This is what America does.

I applaud your forsight to have such interest in such a relative unkown as Bin Laden in 95 (If you mean you have collected his writings dating to that date following 9-11, then I misunderstood). \n\n \n Bin laden has been a major player in theME and world politics afor a VERY long time. It was VERY obvious as early as '93 that Bin Laden was a potential adversary of the US, and a well funded and organised one at that. He had a reasonably large following in the ME and was making some pretty serious power plays there. \n \n The fact that the American public at large had no real idea or interest in who Bin Laden was until the WTC bombing just illustrates the haze in which we live. BL was big news LONG before he showed up on CNN or FOX. \n \n \n \nWhile your posts are well thought out (for the most part) and passionate, I must say once again that there is a definite bias throughout almost each and every one of them, and that seems to be this blind faith that whatever the terrorists do is okay and there are no sinister or alterior motives, yet whatever the U.S. does is wrong across the board.

See, you disregard this POSSIBILITY and accept whatever Bin Laden says without question\n\n \n It would be absolutly irrational for Bin Laden to believe he could somehow completely destroy America through asct of terrorism (though we might certainly destroy ourselves through overspending in response to it). The guy is spending large amounts of money and is living on the run in order to attack America. You really think he is doing this just to get his rocks off? For YEARS he has been calling for America to pull out of the ME. this is what he is after. If he was truly just out to destry America nd inflict massive casualties, his strategy makes no sense. They are hitting high profile targets to make a statement. \n \n You honestly believe that he, and the 18,000 memebers of AQ are nothing but serial killers, killing for the pure joy of it? Come on.\n \n \nWell, the U.S. is the big kid on the block. Common sense dictates that if we fall, these other countries that are \"accepted\" by Al Qaeda will be easily destroyed, much easier than us. If they started with the little guys, we would see the pattern and would (hopefully) take drastic measures (and what we are doing now is NOT drastic) to stop them.

As far as deciding later that they don't like us dealing with the UK and all that rubbish, there is frankly too much self interest in human beings to take such actions over things that do not directly relate to you. \n \n AQ is attacking America because of our foreign policy. They have been saying this for years, all the evidence supports it. I have yet to see any evidence to the contrary. I will base my decisions on evidence, not rhetoric. \n \n \nI know this will not register with you, what with Israel always being wrong, but what about all the cease fires that are agreed on and suddenly there is another homocide bombing. I understand your belief about the \"illegal occupation\" so no need to go that route\n\n \n This has happened one time. After a cease fire was declared, 3 individuals, without any support from any Palestenian organisation carried out an attack. 14 israelis were killed. as a result, a refuge camp was shelled by the israeli army killing over 600. \n \n The situation in israel is a little differnt, as the Israelis are directly and by their own admission responsible for the deaths of well over 100,000 palestenians. In such a situation, they can expect attacks by individuals even if they do manage to negotiate a peace. This will likely take place for a generation or more. People who have lost their entire families to israels real estate policies are not likely to forget about it, regardless of the political situation.\n \n Realistically, you could make a similar argument for Americas involvement in the ME. Since we are not DIRECTLY responsible for many of those deaths by military attacks, I think the pewople there are more likely to strike out closer to home (like by tearing the current rulers of Saudi Arabia apart in the streets). The logistical difficulties that come with carrying out an attack against the US make it a difficult proposition without major funding and planning. \n \n \n \nMan, what a great guy. Bush says things too, but he's a \"liar\" in your eyes. Unbelievable!! \n \n \n That is because he was lying and spouting political rhetoric. Again, I like to look at the evidence before forming an opinion\n \n \n \nWhile there are many things we seem to agree on (reference another thread in this category I think, anyway..), your credibilty is diminished with comments like this. That seems to be important to you as you are referencing my lack of research and my making stupid comments. Well, I guess you've joined my company, because this is one of them. Children call other kids stupid, even though their own behavior is equally stupid, they just don't want to admit it.\n\n \n How is this stupid? Not following. \n \n \n \nLMAO, of course, let's give the benefit of the doubt to the terrorist. The terrorist has no reason to lie whatsoever. Naive comes to mind-not ignorant, so don't fly off the handle now-but c'mon, the hatred you have is misplaced.\n\n \n Like I said before, he obviously has some kind of goal in mind,. there is something he wants. Lying about these goals would be detrimental to obtaining them. If his goal actually was to bring about the downfall of America, it sould be much more logical to state that as his goal. In addition to those willing to rally round for a free ME, he could also pick up support from anti-American activists and fighters all over the world. there are several places in South America where he could pick up a LOT of support (columbi comes to mind). There are also places in the former soviet union that would probaly support such a goal (places with unregistered nuclear weapons no less). \n \n By limiting his goal to liberation fo the ME from US interference, he has only limited his support base. Right now, for all intents and purposes, we only really have to worry about Arabs (a relatively small minority of our population). Can you imagine how much of a mess it would be if he started sending battle hardened freedom fighters from Columbia to attack the US? Suddenly there would be a whole new dimension to the \"war on terror\". When you consider how many hispanics there are in this country, and how porous our southern border is, they could literally send thousands through completely undocumented and they would just blend in with all the other hispanics here. Why can't he do it? Becaus ethose in S America who oppose America nad would be willing to aid in our destruction couldn't care less about the ME. \n \n Americans seem to have this funny idea that we are universally loved throughout the world. at one time this was true. i can rememebr times where I was treated better than others when traveling abroad simply becasue I am an America. those days are long past. Anymore, the list of places that our government suggests we not visit is pretty long. I still routinely send guys off shore for business, and just about anywhere outside of Europe, we provide them with a non-American passport. \n \n \nSo, now we are Nazi's?? LMAO you're killing me here\n\n \n We sure seem to be headed down a lot of the same roads. forcibly invading other countries in order to spread our culture and government and lting to our own citizens about it comes to mind immediatly. Even on the homefront, we see some pretty serious fascism going on. right now, there are American citizens in American prisons on American soil being held without bail, charges, the right to an attorney, or access tot he courts. The supreme court recently heard a case about whether the executive branch has the right to declare US citizens enemy combatants and hold them indefinitly without any rights. Just the fact that somebody in our government (an the prsident no less) seems to think that this even MIGHT be ok is disturbing enough, the fact that we are currently DOING it should be enough to warrant a change of your short.\n \n Yea, I am seeing some definate parralels between the Nazis and America at this time. \n \n \n \n \nJust so I understand, are you saying that we should be isolationist? I mean, I'm all for it, except for me it's all or nothing. If we become isolationist, then to hell with the rest of the world when there are disasters or aggressions, and to hell with the immigrants that come here for a better life. I don't think we are here to only help other countries when it's in THEIR interest and then when it's in OUR interest we have to back off-THAT'S BS\n\n \n No, I am saying that you can conduct yourself in international affairs in such a manner that is mutually benificial. Take, for example, our dealing in the past with south America. We spread around a lot of money down there, installed our own ruthless dictators and pretty much allowed them to run their countries as they please (and many of them still do). In return for giving these guys their own little kngdom to rule over as they please, we jsut wanted US companies to be able to operate in that country tax free, and for them to be exempt from things like minimum wage.\n \n While this may be a great deal for US companies, and for the ruthless dictator we have installed, you are pretty much giving the shaft to the entire populaiton of that country who end up working for a couple of bucks a day and are heavily taxed to make up for the fact that the US companies have driven all the local companies out of business and they are operating tax free. \n \n So, the local population put up with it until the ruthless dictator becomes so unpopular he cannot leave his house for fear of being torn to shreds in the street. At this point, he starts to question whether or not this deal was the best idea. They come to the realisation that they have to make a show of standing up to America, or they are going to loose their little fiefdom to a popular revolt. They tell AMerica to take a flying leap, and BOOM, we are in there \"liberating\" the people (from our buddy) so we can install ANOTHER ruthless dictator to take his place. \n \n you don;t have to do business this way. You can conduct business in an honorable fashion and you don't end up making millions of enemies all over the world. You don't have to use your military to secure trade benifits. You don;t have to support tyranical governments like we have in Saudi because they are easier to deal with than a potential democratically elected one. \n \n I have don a a lot of business with a lot of people, and some are totally cut throat. this always seems to work well for a while, but in reality they are just making enemies and it always seems to come back and bite them in the butt in the end. This is what is happening to America right now. We have finally exploited enough people, and supported enough ruthless dictators, and trained enough death squads in modern torture techniques (school of the Americas) that we are gettin bit in the butt. \n \n Is it really that much to ask of my country that it deal wih people in a fair manner?",

To my knowledge, IF (Islamic Fundamentalists) have enjoined in an effort to remove US intimidation, including support of Israel, from the ME. Bin Laden was our hero supported by our money and materials when he, an IF, was fighting the Russian occupation of Afghanistan. The only message I've ever heard is they want all Westerners, especially Christian American Crusaders, out of the ME, dead or alive, and the same with the Saudi ruling family for their support of Western policies. No talk of an invasion of the US (a silly notion to even suggest) or harm to any countries not suppressing Muslims. \n \n For parallels with Nazi German aggression, I suggest you review the purposes of Germany of that era invading Poland and subsequent invasions to secure natural resources, oil in particular. A majority of wars throughout history have been fought over natural resources to either build national wealth or, since the industrial age, support economic growth that facilitates military strength. I see no indication of IF attempting to gain real estate or secure the natural resources of any other country. Israel and the US do fit those patterns.",

   "I think you are looking at it backwards. There is definatly a side here that should remind of us Nazi Germany, but it isn't the Muslims. When has any Muslim claimed they were fighting becasue they hated our culture, our lifestyle or our religion? \n \n They are fighting because they hate our foreign policy. They hate the fact that we support tyrants and dictators all over the world (like in Saudi Arabia). They hate the fact we send our troops all over the world and meddel on other peoples affairs and force our culture and business models on the rest of the planet. \n \n Right now, there are American troops in Iraq for the purpose of imposing our political system and social structure on a third party. \n \n I think the question should be, is America the new Nazis?\n\n \n Congratulations Daewoo. Your credibility has finally dropped to ZERO and you have now obtained OFFICIAL TROLL  status. \n \n According to the Koran, there are two groups of people in the world. The Dar al-Islam (the house of Islam) and the Dar al-Harb (the house of war). \n It is the rest of the world that doesn't follow the Koran. According to the Koran, God has sent Mohammed with the true religion in order that the truth will overcome all other religions. The Jihad is the means by which Islam will overcome all other religions. According to the Koran, there can only be peace if other religions acknowledge the superiority of Islam and agree to live under its laws.\n You can try to BS others in this forum with your selective knowledge of Islam, but when you get down to the brass tacks, Fundamentalist Islam can only exist in the world if it is the Top Dog.\n Iranian Fundamentalists threw out the Shah of Iran NOT because he supported Israel but because he embraced the Infidels from the West.\n Wahabism, for example, is the anti-thesis of modern Western culture, so to say that Muslims hate the US because of its support for Israel is just plain BS. The Saudi backed Wahabist Mosques throughout the world teach hatred for the West because of the West's decadence, not it's support of the Jews. \n http://www.saag.org/papers10/paper903.html\n \n As for the comparisons to Hitler, no relationship other than a common hatred of Jews. Hitler wasn't an idealogue; Sheikh Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab ibn Sulaiman ibn Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Rashid al Tamimi was.",

   "According to the Koran, there are two groups of people in the world. The Dar al-Islam (the house of Islam) and the Dar al-Harb (the house of war). \n \n \n Huh, lets actually translate the entire passage (I will not even point out that you are using it WAY out of context). Dar al-Islam does not mean \"House of islam\" as you have said. It means \"house of peace\". Islam is a word for peace in the Arabic language. You are correct in Dar al-Harb (though it can also mean \"house of evil\" in some contexts).\n \n So, they are saying there is a \"house of peace\" and a \"house of war\". You will find similar references in the bible.\n \n \nIt is the rest of the world that doesn't follow the Koran. According to the Koran, God has sent Mohammed with the true religion in order that the truth will overcome all other religions. The Jihad is the means by which Islam will overcome all other religions. According to the Koran, there can only be peace if other religions acknowledge the superiority of Islam and agree to live under its laws.\n\n \n Actually, you will find that it refers to those who do not worship the same god. The Quran specifically teaches that cristians, jews, mormons, etc... Must all be respected because they worship the same god as the Muslims. The Quran even has the christmas story in it with mary and joseph and jesus and all that good stuff. \n \n \nYou can try to BS others in this forum with your selective knowledge of Islam, but when you get down to the brass tacks, Fundamentalist Islam can only exist in the world if it is the Top Dog.\n \n\n \n When you get down to \"brass tacks\" as you say, it is obvous that you are preaching about something that you have absolutly no knowledge of. I woudl suggest you read the Quran before you take it upon yourself to critique it. I am not even muslim, and I have read it. You will find the similarities to the cristian bible startling. They have quite a bit of shared content.\n \n There are those who believed that the catholic church could not survive unless they were the \"top dog\" they were wrong, as are you. We have had, and likely will always have, christian fundamentalists, despite the fact that we will probably never again see them take the place of \"top dog\", nor will we likely ever see a theocracy in our country.\n \n Perhapse you could explain your statement a little better. It seems like what you are saying is that there is no room in the world for religous fringe groups. If that is the case, the southern baptists had better watch out.\n \n Instead, you spout ignorant and uneducated rhetoric about that which you do not understand. And I am the troll here? \n \n \nWahabism, for example, is the anti-thesis of modern Western culture, so to say that Muslims hate the US because of its support for Israel is just plain BS. The Saudi backed Wahabist Mosques throughout the world teach hatred for the West because of the West's decadence, not it's support of the Jews. \n http://www.saag.org/papers10/paper903.html\n\n \n Wahabism is very similar to the christian fundamentalist standpoint. they favor a literal interpetation of the Quran.\n \n You are correct that the problem they have witht he west is decadence, not support for the jews. Racism against the Jews is strictly taboo by the teachings of the Quran, sin ce they worship the same god as the Muslims. Backing of the jews is not a problem, it is the backing of israel, a nation that has slaughtered over 100,000, that is the problem. They have no problem with who we are, simply with the things we do, or more accuratly, the things we do that directly affect them. \n \n \n Even your own link backs my interpetation of events. In the section \"Why is Wahabism on a Collision course with the West and Others?\" Two of the resons cited have to do with the US. Here they are:\n \n \nFourth, the Gulf War I, resulted in a significant presence of American and British on the Arabian Soil. The former felt that it is a necessity to keep Saddam Hussain under control. The Saudi Arabian Mullahs felt it otherwise. They considered their presence, as an occupation of their sacred soil. USA, which had portrayed itself as liberator of Kuwait became occupiers of their holy land. They plotted to get rid of Americans from their soil and gain complete independence from the West&#8217;s economic hold on them. \n \n \n \nLastly, oil wealth provided them an opportunity to run an independent foreign policy with or without ruling princes&#8217; approval by directly supporting Madrssas all over the Muslim world. With this they could preach Jihad on a minor pretext e.g. Jihad for the Palestinian cause, Jihad to get Soviets now Russians out of Chechnya, Jihad to get Kashmir liberated, Jihad to expel Americans out of Arabia etc. \n \n \n \n You will note that in BOTH of these, they are talking about American foreign policy, not the total destruction of America.\n \n While I recongnise that to some, ignorant comments and personal insults are a legitimate form of debate. I don't think they fly well here. If you want to debate issues like you presented in the above post, I wuld be happy to do so, but I really don't think we need the personal insults.",

   "The fact that the American public at large had no real idea or interest in who Bin Laden was until the WTC bombing just illustrates the haze in which we live. BL was big news LONG before he showed up on CNN or FOX. \n\n \n While many Americans do tend to live for the sound-byte nowadays, I wouldn't call it a haze necessarily, there are people who have some interest in world events that maybe just didn't \"call \" it right.\n \n \nIt would be absolutly irrational for Bin Laden to believe he could somehow completely destroy America through asct of terrorism (though we might certainly destroy ourselves through overspending in response to it\n). \n \n Quite an assumption that UBL is rational. And as far as destroying the U.S.? Remember the D.C. sniper? The local economy was devastated for that brief period of time and it only took one nutcase to do it. Multiply that by hundreds or more and the country's economy could collapse. So, yes, in that sense, he could very well do it, at least to the point of drastically changing our lifestyle to the point of being completely unrecognizable.\n \n \nYou honestly believe that he, and the 18,000 memebers of AQ are nothing but serial killers, killing for the pure joy of it? Come on.\n\n \n Yep, I do believe that killing Americans is orgasmic for them, you betcha\n \n \nAs far as deciding later that they don't like us dealing with the UK and all that rubbish, there is frankly too much self interest in human beings to take such actions over things that do not directly relate to you. \n \n \n Why is this such a stretch? Are you saying that it's not possible that this could happen? If you are, you have entirely too much faith in the wrong people\n \n \nThis has happened one time. After a cease fire was declared, 3 individuals, without any support from any Palestenian organisation carried out an attack. 14 israelis were killed. as a result, a refuge camp was shelled by the israeli army killing over 600. \n \n \n You say it's happened one time-I'm not so sure, especially considering the fact that Israel is always the guilty party. And I can sense in your numbers here that it's somehow unfair that Israel killed 600-I wasn't aware that a conflict is waged by trading equal blows. I'm sure that if you were on the street and had to fight, you wouldn't give a S*** about a fair fight, I would assume you would want to win. The more they kill, the better chance of endinig all this IMHO, they might even need to step it up a notch to account for the birth rate over there\n \n \nThat is because he was lying and spouting political rhetoric. Again, I like to look at the evidence before forming an opinion\n\n \n There IS no evidence that Bush was lying about anything, that is strictly opinion and interpretations based on a dislike for the man. IF Bush was lying, then so was Clinton and many other world leaders, as well as intelligence agencies around the world. Now, if YOUR intelligence network is somehow better than everyone elses, I think you need to let them in on your secret\n \n \nHow is this stupid? Not following. \n \n \n Well, I think it's clear that calling the U.S \"nazi-like\" is kinda out there, we are nothing like the Nazi's-I see no evidence to support this\n \n \nLike I said before, he obviously has some kind of goal in mind,. there is something he wants. Lying about these goals would be detrimental to obtaining them. If his goal actually was to bring about the downfall of America, it sould be much more logical to state that as his goal.\n \n \n I disagree completely. Take a look at our politics here. Clinton (Kerry also) was/is a Socialist, but when it came time for him to be President, he suddenly became centrist in order to get votes. Granted, his lie wasn't detrimental to getting what he wanted, but the idea is the same. UBL would gain SOME support perhaps SOMEWHERE, but the world in general would be too scared because they know that they would be next on the list. Right now, they are feeling comfy thinking that \"hey, we don't support Israel, so we don't have to worry about a thing\" because people are buying this propaganda from UBL\n \n \nWe sure seem to be headed down a lot of the same roads. forcibly invading other countries in order to spread our culture and government and lting to our own citizens about it comes to mind immediatly.\n \n \n C'MON, if that were our goal, then why don't we just do it to all these other countries?

Even in '93 he had a following of millions. I don't thinkthere was much question that he was going to be a pretty major pain in the neck. Remeber the 9/11 hearings? they were talking about what a big issue he was through both of Clintons terms. The Clintonites claimed he was their top priority. \n \n Personally, I think that if they considered him a top priority and a grave threat to America, they should have said SOMETHING to the public and maybe gotten some public awareness up. Instead, in the typical mantra of our government (secrecy for the sake of secrecy), they kept it from the public and only those who take measures to ensure that they are informed of world news (besides tuning into our inadequate news stations) had any idea of who he was.\n \n \n \nQuite an assumption that UBL is rational.

He is a smart, cold, calculating SOB. He is a zealot with a mission he feels is ordained by god, which means that in his view NO measure will be too extreme. How do you say no to god? \n \n I think it is quite likely that America will self destruct under the pressure of terrorism. Looking at our response thus far, it seems a certainty that we will spend ourselves to death and the American public will not catch on until people are actually starving and troops are being deployed to keep order. IMHO, America is already changing so as to make it nearly recognisable.\n \n \nYep, I do believe that killing Americans is orgasmic for them, you betcha\n\n \n By limiting them to the category of \"serial killer\" you trivialise them.

The PLO was disbanded and the agreement was that israel would begin drawing settlers out of the disputed territories and turn them over to the palestenians. 3 days later, three palestenians who felt that they had been \"sold out\" by the palestenian leaders bombed israel. \n \n I have never believed in the concept of a \"fair fight\".

As a street fighter and barroom brawler from way back, I know there is no such thing. at the end of the day, the win is all that matters. \n \n that said, aren't you the same guy who has berated the Iraqis and palestenians both for fighting dirty?\n \n \n \nThere IS no evidence that Bush was lying about anything, that is strictly opinion and interpretations based on a dislike for the man.

I think that given the way things are going (as in the attitude of the American people) and the relatively low intense responses we have taken, you are right. When the enemy KNOWS he has the protection of our Constitution (which by the way was intended for people of integrity, not to be picked apart by sleazy lawyers) and the ACLU and the like, they have nothing to fear here from us. I truly believe that this will change, I don't think the American people will put up with us being walked on. Once the terrorists fear us, I think, at the very least, they will leave here.

The only thing I have berated the Arabs for as far as dirty fighting is that then don't whine about US fightinig back as dirty. You know as well as I do, play any sport, and if one side doesn't play by the rules, the \"good\" side WILL lose. Once the \"good\" side plays equally as dirty, THEN we have a game. If that means \"innocent\" civilians being slaughtered, then so be it. You have made many statements about the \"innocent\" civilians in Iraq being killed by our invasion and what a shame it is, but I have not heard the victims of 911 mentioned very often. I fail to see how fighting for a political cause justifies killing civilians, but killing civilians in a fight to preserve our way of life (not to mention liberating many millions) is suddenly an evil act. \n \n \nNo other intellignece agency or world leader has claimed that we are being attacked for anything but our foreign policies.

   "These anti American statments sickin me. Don't get me wrong. I dont subscribe to blind faith, but thats another subject. America is Top Dog, as you like to put it. As such we are going to continually have terrorists, along with other nations, gunning for us. Such is the case with most top dogs in the world beit sports, business, politics, you name it. \n \n I believe you are wrong in your perception of the American people. We are as strong as ever and pull together when needed to advance our top dog statis. A well financed yet raggedy group of desert dwelers is not enough to topple freewill!!! \n \n Being the top dog affords us some luxuries that unfortunatly come at the expense of others. Such is life. If the tables were turned and the ME were at the top, do you think they would display remorse for depleting our timber industry so as to provide the housing market with the materials needed to flurish? How about steel, concrete, or agriculture? I think not. When you are at the top you get to set the tempo and allow others to try and keep up.\n \n \n UBL can have whatever motives he wishes to proclaim. That still does not change the fact that he wishes death to America for our way of life, treatment of women, freedom of expression, etc... I too am very well traveled and have spent many hours in the presence of fanatic muslims Frenchmen and Germans. I once sat with an Eqyptian Muslim that spoke for hours about American women wearing cotton panties for their sexual gradification. He tried to explain that cotton hit all the right places as women walked and that all American women were whores for wearing them. This too was his justification for circumsizing his 12 year old daughter while she was awake and could feel every slice of the knife. I too have heard the whining and moaning about Americans and American Policy. To this I answer, we are living in a global economy. We are the leaders of that economy and we will do what we see fit to protecting that economy. If you don't like our policies then knock us from our position and impose your own policies.\n \n The world is not fair. The world's people do not play nicely. You must take what you can get, when you can get it. If you can help some other people along the way, then you are ahead of the game and should be given credit for your generosity. However, if you stop in your tracks to divey everything equally, you will be taken advantage of and left in the dust with only your stupidity to blame. \n \n Daewoo, if this country is to fall, its your \"play nicely\" approach to world politics and the entitlments that many have come to expect that will lead to our demise. If you are concerned about overspending, you should be concerned about government giveaways and wreckless use of social programs, instead of America defending itself against those that wish to see our demise. You have misplaced your patriotism and wandered into enemy territory. I suggest you rejoin us Americans and help the furtherment of our country rather than dragging us down. emoticon_xbye",

   "I don't think we're going the same direction as Germany with regard to a world war, but we are putting ourselves in the same predicament with regard to dependency on debt, trade imbalance and public ignorance. Nazi Germany's 'military tune-up' in Spain's Civil War was accepted by the rest of the world due to the existence of a severe world depression and no country wanted to rock the trade boat with Germany (or Japan) as both nations were experiencing strong economic gains from building their war machines. Good customers if you please. When Germany invaded Poland, England and other European nations were forced to face the facts and declare war on Germany, even though Germany was, at the time, their strongest economic partner. That ended all credit facilities for Germany, including the ability to use their strong economy to leverage favorable trade terms. Becoming an isolationist actually forced Germany into the conquest of other countries, those in particular with large oil resources for that era, as trade was unavailable to feed the only industry they could utilize, a war machine. The important thing to remember is that all politicians in the Nazi party, including Hitler, were in power from popular elections, and won by large majorities. \n \n Gobbels took advantage of emotional nationalism, Hitler's construction of the military had pulled Germany from a deep economic depression, to build the mentality of the German public into a united front by convincing them that they were a supreme race, to the point of breeding stereotype images and purging undesirables (Jews). As Goering stated after the war, it was simple to manipulate the people, they were told they were defending Germany and those who questioned the direction were labeled unpatriotic, to be 'enlightened' by Himmler's Gestapo. \n \n The printing presses were cranked up and Germany continued expansion on a false economy, using internal debt and pillaged resources to force economic success until military defeats slowed down the flow of pillage and a whole lot of worthless money started trying to find scarce consumer products such as food and other necessities. \n \n The US is in much the same beginning economic position, our economy continues to show a 'jobless' recovery, not much, but with enough polish to sate the public, driven primarily by public/personal debt and record government expansion. 45% of our treasury issues, about all that remains after SS and other public trusts diverted to general funds are replaced by our own debt, are purchased by foreign entities. They're tied to our economy and don't want it to crash, as they'd probably go down with us. China is now financing a disproportionate portion of our trade imbalance, grinning I'm sure, and we've lost the majority of foreign investment in our equity markets over the past year plus. All this is taking place with declining tax revenues, an endless money pit in Iraq and additional pressure on Saudi Arabia for more oil to further increase our trade imbalance. Which puts more heat on the Saud Family, hated by Bin Laden. We may have the world's most powerful military, but we're on a fast downhill fiscal track. Most nations now hate our aggressive tactics, our arrogance and our dollar. I feel we're on top only through momentum from the vast size of our economy and the only question is who we take with us when it's time to pay the piper. Our public, like all publics, will do as politicians tell them by putting it in the usual terms of patriotism and 'you're the best' rhetoric. A few more years and China won't need our consumer market or debt as that will be by far the world's largest consumer market and control world trade. And they've already arranged to get their oil from former USSR states through trade, not debt. Then what do we do with our huge, vastly expensive military machine with no conversion ability to peacetime application? Declare the rest of the world inferior, starting with Muslims? Many citizens already seem to be developing that attitude.",

   "BL was pretty hard to call any other way, though there was some speculation that he would be \"handled\" by the saudis. Even in '93 he had a following of millions. I don't thinkthere was much question that he was going to be a pretty major pain in the neck. Remeber the 9/11 hearings? they were talking about what a big issue he was through both of Clintons terms. The Clintonites claimed he was their top priority. \n \n Personally, I think that if they considered him a top priority and a grave threat to America, they should have said SOMETHING to the public and maybe gotten some public awareness up. Instead, in the typical mantra of our government (secrecy for the sake of secrecy), they kept it from the public and only those who take measures to ensure that they are informed of world news (besides tuning into our inadequate news stations) had any idea of who he was.\n\n \n In retrospect, they should have nuked his training camps. That would have gotten his attention, or him. ;) \n \n\n Assuming that BL is irrational is a HUGE mistake for the American public to make. He is a smart, cold, calculating SOB. He is a zealot with a mission he feels is ordained by god, which means that in his view NO measure will be too extreme. How do you say no to god? \n\n The fact that he is a zealot that believes no measure is too extreme proves that he's irrational. \n \n\n I think it is quite likely that America will self destruct under the pressure of terrorism. Looking at our response thus far, it seems a certainty that we will spend ourselves to death and the American public will not catch on until people are actually starving and troops are being deployed to keep order. IMHO, America is already changing so as to make it nearly recognisable.\n\n I think that many Americans are still acting out of fear. I predict that if there is another major terrorist attack on US soil, the deserts will run red with the blood of hundreds of thousands of Arabs and we'd better start preparing for Armageddon and buy our plane tickets to Esdraelon. ;)\n \n\n By limiting them to the category of \"serial killer\" you trivialise them. This is not a good tact to take when dealing with such people.\n\n Agreed. We should think of them as rabid dogs that should be exterminated upon first contact with humans. emoticon_xkill \n [quote]\n I am saying it is not logical. The onlyu faith I have ion the human race as a whole is faith in the fact that we are violent, self serving beings barely discernable thna the tailess monkeys that walked upright out of the jungle so many thousands of years ago.\n \n No argument there. Humans behave just like other animals when they're cornered without any means of escape.\n \n\n One time. it was following the invasion of lebanon. The PLO was disbanded and the agreement was that israel would begin drawing settlers out of the disputed territories and turn them over to the palestenians. 3 days later, three palestenians who felt that they had been \"sold out\" by the palestenian leaders bombed israel. \n\n That just shows you that in a highly volatile atmosphere, it takes but one spark to cause an explosion.\n \n\n I have never believed in the concept of a \"fair fight\". I have always believed that the entire concept is simply one used by the loser. As a street fighter and barroom brawler from way back, I know there is no such thing. at the end of the day, the win is all that matters.\n\n Fair fights are for individuals, not nations. \n \n\n that said, aren't you the same guy who has berated the Iraqis and palestenians both for fighting dirty?\n\n Sending women and children bombers in to do their bidding is cowardice, not just dirty fighting.\n \n\n No other intellignece agency or world leader has claimed that we are being attacked for anything but our foreign policies. Clinton even admitted after the bombing of the USS Cole that this was done in response to our foreign p9licies. For Bush to get up there and claim that they are not attacking us because of our policies, but because they find our very existance repugnant is assinine. There is NO logical basis OR evidence to support this position. The Bush administration has not provided any, nor has anybody else. All evidence seems to point to attacks based on our foreign policy.\n\n Might I suggest that you read the May issue of Imprimis.\n http://www.hillsdale.edu/newimprimis/2004/may/default.htm\n It gives a good explanation on the motives of UBL and radical Islam. \n \n\n Turn on Fox, or MSNBC, or CNN. You will see American troops using military power to instill our system of government and social structure on another nation. Watch a litle longer and there is a good chance you will se a couple of stories about American citizens being held without trial, charges, or access to the courts. Keep it tuned in for some interesting stories about warrantless searchs. Then, listen to the fascist rhetoric of some of our fellow citizens who are all for wiping the arabs off the face of the planet. Listen to the racist and religous rhetoric they use to justify their opinions. Then, turn the news back on and listen for a while and they will say a few things about invading syria, and maybe even replay a little of Bushs speach where he claims that not only are we shooting for an \"american iraq\", but we aim to Americanise the entire middle east, becasue we are just better. Our social system, our political system, and our economic system is just better. Therefore, it is our responsibiltiy of as the master race to spread it throughout Europe. \n \n Sorry, started quoting Hitlers ideology at the end. The two are so similar that sometimes they blur in my mind.\n\n \n Cute\n \n\n If you stick this whole thing into a pro-israel, anti-israel wrapper, that works just fine. The problem is, it doesn;t fit in a wrapper like that any better than you could squeeze an elephant into a shoe box. We are not talking about other governments supporting him. the US has made certain that we have installed ruthless puppet governments in nations that we consider a serious threat. We are talking folks like the freedom fighters in columbia supporting him. People with nothing really to loose, but everything to gain by the destruction of America. \n\n I fail to see what they have to gain by the destruction of the world's most generous trading partner. Maybe if they had to deal with France more often, they'd know what they were missing. :)\n \n\n Because we couldn't get away with it. How do you think that the rest fo the world would respond if we started adding states or territories to the US? It would not be pretty. Already we are seeing damaged relations on a wide scale because of our little tif in Iraq. the Us is not in a position where we can afford to tick off the rest of the world. We are too dependant on them to manufature the goods we use. We are also too dependant ont hem to finance our debt. Over 80% of our national debt is financed internationally.\n\n \n You underestimate the resolve of the American public. Once you wake up the giant, he acts swiftly and decisively. How long do you think it would take the US to occupy and conquer ANY nation in the world if it felt so inclined to do so? The only country that could even slow down an advancing US Army is China and they'd be doing so with shear numbers. So, I think that you have it backwards. The rest of the world better not tick off us. \n emoticon_rolleyes",

   "JP, I can't agree with you on the point of Bin Laden being a zealot to the point of irrationality. This is obviously an extremely intelligent man (we thought so when fully supporting him against the USSR) who has devoted his life and resources to his goal. I don't want to debate his goal, but the fact that IMO his operational planning and execution presents an organization that has calculated how to apply their resources in the most effective possible manner with the least amount of retaliation. He has managed to put the world's mightiest nation on a road to financial ruin, changed the way we live and, when analyzed from purely a political policy point of view, offended no nation other than the US, Israel and the UK, at a cost estimated to be less than $500k. Remember that there is no quarter given in war, and he considers his 9/11 action a war operation, so moralist or emotional patriotic opinions don't count in defining methodology or effectiveness. For debate purposes, what would you have done in his shoes were the roles reversed and would you consider yourself irrational if you felt you could influence freedom for oppressed Christianity using whatever was at your disposal?",

   "In retrospect, they should have nuked his training camps.

From a logical standpoint, his moves to date are the work of a genius. Look at what he has cost the US so far. Hundreds of billions down the toilet with no real hope of recouping those losses, possibly irreprarable damage to the US in terms of foreign relations and international opinion, and we still can't find the guy. Al Queda is bigger than it ever was, and better funded. \n \n I would imagine that about 1 guy in 100 million could pull this off, especially when you consider the relatively miniscule amount they have spent on this enterprise. These are the acts of a genius. Maybe an evil genius, but still a genius.\n \n \nI think that many Americans are still acting out of fear.

Let them die right along side the men.\n \n As far as the \"children\" thing goes, they don't send folks that they consider children generally. There is no 18=adult in most of the developing world.

He makes an interesting argument, but errs pretty badly in claiming that Saudi Arabia and Bin Laden are in this thing together. If you will remember, BL was deprted from Saudi Arabia, and we know that at least a dozen times they sent people form their intelligence service to assasinate him. The Sauds still have a price on his head. \n \n I think that people fail to understand the Wahhabis. They have trouble understanding that these guys are no better and no worse than the christian fundamentalists. There are sects that preach a somewhat strange and violent form of Islam, just as there are some racist in the Us that preach a strange and violent form of christianity. \n \n What Schwartz boils down to is a conspiracy theorist. There is a fair to decent group of his articles linked at http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/authors.asp?ID=321 . I would warn you to take his writings with a grain of salt. He writes from an academic standpoitn, he has not extensively studied the Muslim faith, nor does he speak arabic. Several years ago he kind of stumbled onto Wahhabism and he saw \"black helicopters\" so to speak.\n \n \nCute\n\n \n I try\n \n \nI fail to see what they have to gain by the destruction of the world's most generous trading partner. Maybe if they had to deal with France more often, they'd know what they were missing. :)\n\n \n Most generous to who? And generous in what manner? The french are easy to deal with. They want money, and lots of it. They will sell weapons or oil field equipment to anybody who can cahgh up the bucks. They just want to get paid. They are not interested in building empires, or using agressive foreign policy to enhance their trade dominance. \n \n \nYou underestimate the resolve of the American public. Once you wake up the giant, he acts swiftly and decisively. How long do you think it would take the US to occupy and conquer ANY nation in the world if it felt so inclined to do so? The only country that could even slow down an advancing US Army is China and they'd be doing so with shear numbers. So, I think that you have it backwards. The rest of the world better not tick off us. \n \n \n Well, we have worked awfully hard to get international support for just Iraq and Afghanistan, because they are more thna we can handle. We can roll over the opposing army, but cannot deal with the guerilla fighters. This is the new face of warfare. Even Saddam learned from Gulf 1. If you will recall, he was conscripting everybody he could get his hands on to fight the first gulf war. This time around, he just put his regular army out there, but before we moved in he installed caches of weapons all over the country. When the army fell, the civilian population picked up these weapons and continued the fight. \n \n Perhapse you have forgotten that it was not long ago that some were suggesting that we re-institute the draft. this is not something that people consider when you ahve steamrolled a country and won a decisive victory. From a realistic standpoint, our forces are stretched about as thin as we want to see them. \n \n Right now, we are counting on international support to get us out of the mess we have created. Time will tell whether this is going to work or not. We have been trying to convince other countries to pony up to help with the expenses to rebuild Iraq, but thus far have not been sucessful and there is no real indication that we will be much more sucessful in the future. Other countries have pointed out that, as the invaders, we have the sole responsibility for the cost of rebuilding. How many more \"victories\" like this can we really afford?\n \n If recent history is any kind of indicator, any country bigger or better organised than Iraq is pretty much outside our grasp. While we could without question roll over their military, anywhere int he world we are likely to run into the same problem with the civilian population. This is not like WWII, where a HUGE number of hte men had already been killed, and in all reality there was not enough of a base left to support guerilla operations. \n \n I also don't think we could do it from an international relations viewpoint. We CANNOT exist as a country without international support. We simply do not have the manufaturing base to do so. We run a fairly large trade deficit. You cannot fight a war without materials, and most of our materials come from outside the US.",

Even in the roman Empire, it was not entirely effective (look up a guy named \"spartacus\", he instigated a slave rebellion).\n \n If we were figthing with swords, maybe this would be effective, as it would certianly discourage a certain percentage of your population from joining in the rebellion, and civilains going up against the Roman army literally needed to arm and mobilise everybody they could get their hands on. figure that if you were going to go up against trained legionaires with untrained civilians, you needed to out number them by at least 3 to 1.\n \n By contrast, it takes a relatively small number of people to carry out an effective guerilla war.

That, combined with the fact of even one instance of decimation, would turn the entire population into guerrillas and the Christians would then face using genocide as a solution. Due to the 'turn the other cheek' moral structure of Christianity, the only way genocide has been palatable in the past was with 'faceless' fire/napalm/conventional/nuclear bombing, guaranteeing escape for a certain portion of the population. Since nukes are out as oil is the name of the ME game, it would take numbers to totally secure even Iraq, estimated by our pentagon at 3-400k troops. We're stretched thin with 150k troops there, including 15k 'loyal' coalition troops, so even if decimation was used, each instance would no doubt increase the guerrilla population by the nine not killed and we'd be quickly run out of ammo after being overwhelmed by the remaining 20 million citizens. Most ME populations aren't followers fattened up by decades of TV addiction and instant gratification.\n \n Contemporary Christianity, with all of its moral baggage, (as versus the original Crusaders with their dark age brutality) is far outclassed in ground war when facing Muslims defending their home. Read some of the memoirs by USSR troops from Afghanistan where 12-year old kids were using the barrels of AK47s to force open tank hatches at 30mph over rough terrain to slide a grenade in. Vietnam has stories of equal determination. We require moral justification brought only by superior numbers (believers) to facilitate any expansion of our oppression, our moral righteousness will not prevail in guerrilla warfare, and a general draft would be a tough sell to the US public.",

   "I'm sorry, but you continually make this statement or at the very least imply it, and I think anyone with rational thought realizes that the current problems in Iraq are not being caused by the civilians, but rather the \"soldiers\" and those loyal to Hussein. I get the feeling that you might be thinking if you repeat this enough, people will accept your contention. You seem to carefully word your posts, so this doesn't come across as a slip up\n\n \n Since there is no more Iraqi governemnt, the former soldiers are, at this point, all civilians. We can almost certainly expect them to explot these caches of weapons.\n \n Looking at the numbers coming out of Iraq as far as militia numbers and such, your conclusion does not hold up that these are saddam loyalists. Even just Aladars militia disproves this point, as Al-Sadar was (and remains today) anti-Saddam. \n \n I have heard estimates of insurgent strengths between 2 and 4 million. The Bush administration claimed for a LONG time that we were looking at less than 100,000 fighters, until recently when they announced that they had brokered a deal that took over 100,000 fighters out of the game.\n \n From a realistic standpoint, these could not possibly all be saddam supporters. Loooking at how many civilians we killed on the way in (10,000+) it should not eb difficult to understand who these fighters are and why they are fighting.\n \n We are there killing people (supposedly) because a few thousand Americans were killed at the WTC. We invaded Afghanistan for the same reason. We only lost a few thousnad out of 200,000,000. they lost 10,000+ out of a population of only 24 million. This is bound to cause some anger and resentment.\n \n It is not a slip up, nor am I trying to decieve anybody into accepting some baseless contention. Looking at the groups that are fighting, they are civilain militias and are in large part antui saddam. they appear to be people that are upset because their country has been invaded, their fellow citizens killed, and America is trying to reform their government using Iraqi exiles and foreigners. \n \n If this happened in America, I would certainly be on the street with a gun, killing as many of the occupiers as I could.",

   "I don't think we're going the same direction as Germany with regard to a world war, but we are putting ourselves in the same predicament with regard to dependency on debt, trade imbalance and public ignorance. Nazi Germany's 'military tune-up' in Spain's Civil War was accepted by the rest of the world due to the existence of a severe world depression and no country wanted to rock the trade boat with Germany (or Japan) as both nations were experiencing strong economic gains from building their war machines. Good customers if you please. When Germany invaded Poland, England and other European nations were forced to face the facts and declare war on Germany, even though Germany was, at the time, their strongest economic partner. That ended all credit facilities for Germany, including the ability to use their strong economy to leverage favorable trade terms. Becoming an isolationist actually forced Germany into the conquest of other countries, those in particular with large oil resources for that era, as trade was unavailable to feed the only industry they could utilize, a war machine. The important thing to remember is that all politicians in the Nazi party, including Hitler, were in power from popular elections, and won by large majorities. \n \n Gobbels took advantage of emotional nationalism, Hitler's construction of the military had pulled Germany from a deep economic depression, to build the mentality of the German public into a united front by convincing them that they were a supreme race, to the point of breeding stereotype images and purging undesirables (Jews). As Goering stated after the war, it was simple to manipulate the people, they were told they were defending Germany and those who questioned the direction were labeled unpatriotic, to be 'enlightened' by Himmler's Gestapo. \n \n The printing presses were cranked up and Germany continued expansion on a false economy, using internal debt and pillaged resources to force economic success until military defeats slowed down the flow of pillage and a whole lot of worthless money started trying to find scarce consumer products such as food and other necessities. \n \n The US is in much the same beginning economic position, our economy continues to show a 'jobless' recovery, not much, but with enough polish to sate the public, driven primarily by public/personal debt and record government expansion. 45% of our treasury issues, about all that remains after SS and other public trusts diverted to general funds are replaced by our own debt, are purchased by foreign entities. They're tied to our economy and don't want it to crash, as they'd probably go down with us. China is now financing a disproportionate portion of our trade imbalance, grinning I'm sure, and we've lost the majority of foreign investment in our equity markets over the past year plus. All this is taking place with declining tax revenues, an endless money pit in Iraq and additional pressure on Saudi Arabia for more oil to further increase our trade imbalance. Which puts more heat on the Saud Family, hated by Bin Laden. We may have the world's most powerful military, but we're on a fast downhill fiscal track. Most nations now hate our aggressive tactics, our arrogance and our dollar. I feel we're on top only through momentum from the vast size of our economy and the only question is who we take with us when it's time to pay the piper. Our public, like all publics, will do as politicians tell them by putting it in the usual terms of patriotism and 'you're the best' rhetoric. A few more years and China won't need our consumer market or debt as that will be by far the world's largest consumer market and control world trade. And they've already arranged to get their oil from former USSR states through trade, not debt. Then what do we do with our huge, vastly expensive military machine with no conversion ability to peacetime application? Declare the rest of the world inferior, starting with Muslims? Many citizens already seem to be developing that attitude.\n\n \n \n Which countries are calling in the chips? Which of our so called allies are threating to break our financial back? Yeah we have made some unpopular decisions recently. Yes we have lost the backing of France and Germany for our war on terrorism. We certainly have not lost their support elsewhere. \n \n BTW I did not say muslims were inferior, but while on the subject of the military. Do you believe we live in a world that no longer needs a war machine? Do you think our vastly expensive military machine should be converted into some type of peacetime application? What did you have in mind? Tank sized flower pots? \n \n When China gets to big for its britches how fast do you suppose we can regain our former strength? The minute we let down our guard we will be fighting Chinese or Muslims, in the streets of America. \n \n Sometimes the best decisions are the toughest ones. Sometimes we must break from the pack to win the race. The recent death of Former President Reagan has reminded me of another time when we had to break from the pack and make some unpopular postion. We aquired heavy debt and isolated ourselves against the Soviets. Many people like yourself said we were isolating our selves into ruin and that Reagan was a war monger. Neither were true and wer are still here to fight the same fight again today. \n \n I agree we have poor fiscal policies in place. We spend to much money. Period. I cannot run my household the same way the government runs the country. Cuts need to be made. Where you and I seem to disagree is the areas to be cut.",

Neither China or Russia has the capability to invade and occupy us in a conventional war, nor the desire to do so. Just as we could never successfully invade and occupy either of them. Most of the world is concentrating on their own interests without resorting to gunboat diplomacy. Retain our superior defense capability and forget the nation building literally all over the world. The polished GDP can only be sustained by debt for a limited period of time, and the ME, and Israel, will be unimportant in a couple of decades. We're thinking short-term and we don't have that luxury. But either way it doesn't bother me except for debate purposes; I'm an old guy and I won't have to worry about taking responsibility for the current mistakes when it comes time to pay the piper. I would like one more period of high inflation combined with a false surge in the economy to create some higher interest rates for long-term stuff and may get it, but either way, like adjustable home loans now being tied to Libor instead of domestic issues for stability, it doesn't matter.

All accounts I have heard were positive towards Americans. The uprisings are being brought about by small fringe group in a struggle for power. The only experience they have with gaining power is thru violence. Thats what they know. Thats what they use.\n\n \n March 16, 2004 \n Pew Global Attitudes Project\n Polls/Survey Results\n \n \n A year after the war in Iraq, discontent with America and its policies has intensified rather than diminished. Opinion of the United States in France and Germany is at least as negative now as at the war's conclusion, and British views are decidedly more critical. \n \n Perceptions of American unilateralism remain widespread in European and Muslim nations, and the war in Iraq has undermined America's credibility abroad. Doubts about the motives behind the U.S.-led war on terrorism abound, and a growing percentage of Europeans want foreign policy and security arrangements independent from the United States. Across Europe, there is considerable support for the European Union to become as powerful as the United States. \n \n The latest survey by the Pew Global Attitudes Project, conducted from late February to early March in the U.S. and eight other countries, shows that Muslim anger toward the United States remains pervasive, although the level of hatred has eased somewhat and support for the war on terrorism has inched up. Osama bin Laden, however, is viewed favorably by large percentages in Pakistan (65%), Jordan (55%) and Morocco (45%). Even in Turkey, where bin Laden is highly unpopular, as many as 31% say that suicide attacks against Americans and other Westerners in Iraq are justifiable. \n \n Note that the following is prior to the latest round of insurgency and supported by one oof King Bremer's perople. No internal (US) polls have been released by Bremer in almost a month.\n \n By Thomas E. Ricks\n Washington Post Staff Writer\n Thursday, May 13, 2004; Page A10 \n \n Four out of five Iraqis report holding a negative view of the U.S. occupation authority and of coalition forces, according to a new poll conducted for the occupation authority. \n \n In the poll, 80 percent of the Iraqis questioned reported a lack of confidence in the Coalition Provisional Authority, and 82 percent said they disapprove of the U.S. and allied militaries in Iraq. \n \n Although comparative numbers from previous polls are not available, \"generally speaking, the trend is downward,\" said Donald Hamilton, a senior counselor to civilian administrator L. Paul Bremer. The occupation authority has been commissioning such surveys in Iraq since late last year, he said. This one was taken in Baghdad and several other Iraqi cities in late March and early April, shortly before the surge in anti-coalition violence and a few weeks before the detainee-abuse scandal became a major issue for the U.S. authorities in Iraq. \n \n The new polling data, which have not been publicly released, are provoking concern among occupation authority officials and in Washington because they provide additional evidence that the U.S. effort in Iraq is not winning over Iraqi public opinion. The Bush administration and the U.S. military have said that the keys to the United States achieving its goals in Iraq are winning at least mild support from most Iraqis and creating Iraqi forces to provide security. \n \n \"How to . . . win the hearts and minds of the people [in Iraq] is one of the things that we really have to work at,\" Army Lt. Gen. Keith B. Alexander, head of Army intelligence, told the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this week. \"I mean, that is the key to solving not only that problem but the rest of the problems in the Middle East.\" \n \n Hamilton, who said he oversees public opinion issues for Bremer, declined to provide the number of Iraqis surveyed or other methodological details but said in an e-mail that \"polls here are generally reliable\" and that the new findings were consistent with those of other polls. He referred other questions to occupation authority spokesman Daniel Senor, who did not respond to requests by telephone and e-mail for comment and for historical data. \n \n The new data reflect the fact that \"the occupation, and the occupation forces, are getting increasingly unpopular,\" said Jeffrey White, a former Middle Eastern affairs analyst for the Defense Intelligence Agency. In recent months, he said, \"A lot of people, including me, have been getting very pessimistic.\" \n \n Reflecting that trend, the proportion of Baghdad residents who reported worries about safety has steadily increased: In the new poll, 70 percent named security as the \"most urgent issue\" they faced, up from 50 percent in January, 60 percent in February and 65 percent a month later. \n \n Overall, 63 percent of those polled said security was the most urgent issue facing Iraq. In addition to Baghdad, the poll was conducted in the northern city of Mosul and the southern cities of Basra, Nasiriyah and Karbala. Some questions also were asked in the troubled western town of Ramadi. \n \n In the poll, which was taken just before the April uprising of the militia led by radical Shiite Muslim cleric Moqtada Sadr, a large proportion of Iraqis from the central and southern parts of the country said they backed him, with 45 percent of those in Baghdad saying they support him, and 67 percent in Basra. \n \n Those numbers are striking because the U.S. military and the occupation authority have declared Sadr a public enemy whom they want to kill or capture. The Army has been maneuvering in central Iraq for weeks, occasionally fighting parts of his militia but avoiding a head-on clash in the holy city of Najaf. Yesterday, U.S. tanks and helicopters fought his militia in Karbala. \n \n There were a few bright spots in the poll. The Iraqi police received a 79 percent positive rating, the best of the seven institutions about which questions were asked. The reformed Iraqi army was not far behind, with a 61 percent positive rating. \n \n Those polled were broadly divided on who should appoint the interim government that is supposed to take over limited power from the occupation authority at the end of June. The largest group, 27 percent, said the Iraqi people should appoint the new leaders, while 23 percent said judges should. Only one-tenth of 1 percent said that the U.S.-appointed Iraqi Governing Council should name the government, which is supposed to run Iraq until elections are held next year. None said the occupation authority should. \n \n Indicating a general skepticism of foreign involvement in their political future, 83 percent of those polled said that only Iraqis should be involved in supervising the 2005 elections. \n \n The poll's findings appeared consistent with one taken about the same time in Iraq by USA Today, CNN and Gallup, which found that 57 percent of Iraqis wanted foreign troops to leave immediately. \n \n Some senior Pentagon officials have a different view of the situation. \"The truth is, the majority of the Iraqi people want democracy in Iraq to succeed and are positive about what the future holds, thanks in large part to the efforts of our servicemen and women,\" the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. Richard B. Myers, said at a Senate hearing yesterday. \n \n A poll released yesterday found that U.S. public opinion on Iraq also is shifting. \"For the first time, a majority of Americans -- 51 percent -- say the war is not going well,\" the Pew Research Center reported. That is double the percentage who said that in January. But the poll said 53 percent of Americans favor keeping troops there until a stable Iraqi government is established. \n \n I'd provide polls from ME media sources but many posters on this forum seem to feel they're too biased in favor of the 'tiny group of insurgents' who seem to be able to keep 150k of troops on their toes, out of most Iraqi city centers and almost to the point of having supply convoys escorted by air support.

   "The difficulty in gaining lasting control in Iraq ISN'T that we lack the firepower or manpower to do so. It's that we, as civilized Christians, refuse to resort to barbaric practices to win. You don't need 100k troops to control Najaf. It would only take a couple tactical nukes launched from hundreds of miles away. There isn't a country in the world that could stand up to the firepower of the US if the US decided to forego its morality and fight like its enemies, no holds barred. In WWII, we put aside our compassion for civilian causulties on many occasions. The firebombings of Dresden, Tokyo and the nuking of Hiroshimo and Nagasaki are a few examples of the wrath of an angry America.\n If you think for a minute that we couldn't be brought back to that level of anger again, you don't know Americans very well.\n We used to walk softly and carry a big stick. Now, we walk heavily and carry a big arsenal. emoticon_xkill\n\n \n Besides bringing similar retaliations against us, this would be a most unprofitable enterprise. \n \n The only thing we are interested in as far as the ME goes is oil. There is nothing there we care about at all, including israel. The oil is all that matters.\n \n Besides the retaliation that such an action would bring from other oil producing nations in the air (imagine a big spigot being turned off), it would make Iraqi oil so expensive that it would destroy the point of the entire exercise.\n \n While it is possible to drill for oil in a nucler waste land, you need people to do it. You really think that the Iraqi people could be expected to help (assuming there are any left)? So, you are stuck importing your labor. then, every worker in the region would have to have protective suits at $2100 per pop, and these are single use. Al facilities would have to be shieded from radiation (and pemanent raditation shielding makes protectvie suits look cheap). All pipelines would also have to be shielded, since people do not want radioactive gasoline.\n \n Sure, for a trillion dollars, you could turn Iraq into a nuclear wasteland and drill oil there. Are you really willing to pay $250.00 per gallon for gas is the question.\n \n Add to this the fact that we would almost certainly see retaliation in kind, and this gets even more expensive. At one time it was a big deal the the US had THE BOMB. Now, everybody has THE BOMB. Those who do not need only the materials to make one. \n \n When the US made our first nuke, things like milling machines accurate to within 5 microns and lathes of the same accuracy were unheard of. They were specially built in order to build the bomb. Now, they are all over the place. I have 3 such milling machines at work, and one for personal use in my barn. I also have a lathe that is more than accurate enough to do the job.\n \n Nuclear materials disapear pretty frquently, and it is a miracle that none heva found thier way into terrorists hands yet (assumong they havent already).",

The very imposition of separation on women is the beginnings of oppression. You are arguing that oppression is subjective?\n \n The legal status of putting a woman below a man is oppression, and might account for the remarkable low divorce rates - because without her 'man' she is nothing.\n \n Even Muslims in western countries provide generally the only social source for women and any attempt to leave this close-knit community is actively discouraged. There are cases in Britain of Muslim men killing their daughters who go out with Christians.\n \n Even one person who wrote, claiming the Koran is not about discrimination recognises that discrimination exists, based on people's accounting of the Koran...\n \"Beginning with a historical analysis of religious authority and knowledge, Barlas shows how Muslims came to read inequality and patriarchy into the Qur'an to justify existing religious and social structures and demonstrates that the patriarchal meanings ascribed to the Qur'an are a function of who has read it, how, and in what contexts. She goes on to reread the Qur'an's position on a variety of issues in order to argue that its teachings do not support patriarchy. To the contrary, Barlas convincingly asserts that the Qur'an affirms the complete equality of the sexes, thereby offering an opportunity to theorize radical sexual equality from within the framework of its teachings. This new view takes readers into the heart of Islamic teachings on women, gender, and patriarchy, allowing them to understand Islam through its most sacred scripture, rather than through Muslim cultural practices or Western media stereotypes.\"\n http://www.utexas.edu/utpress/books/barbel.html\n \n This is from another pro-Islamic site\n \"Meanwhile, real Muslim women suffer at the hands of societies and governments who would harm them in the name of Islam.\"\n http://www.islamfortoday.com/ummzaid06.htm\n \n Or another...\n \"There is considerable overlap of rights that now exist in the Western world and those which Muslim women have always had (at least in principle if not in practice)\"\n http://www.islamic.org.uk/women.html\n \n None of them are saying that oppression doesn't occur.

They believe this oppression is un-Islamic, whereas I believe it's entrenched in Islam (which itself means 'submission')\n We can argue about the 'why' any time, but for you to suggest that oppression of women is simply a western construct, and therefore not applicable to Islamic nations is truly odd.\n \n I'll show you a white-wash\n The Quran raised the status of women. It prohibited female infanticide; abolished women's status as mere property; established women's legal capacity; granted women the right to receive their own dowry; and allowed women to retain control over their property and use their maiden name after marriage.\n http://www.gulf-news.com/Articles/Opinion.asp?ArticleID=95794\n \n All of what is said is true... but it needs qualification because it is full of half-truths...\n But for instance, when it says it established women's legal capacity, it established that as being half of a man's.\n Women were able to control their own property, but if they married they couldn't and if they had a son, their share of any inheritence was massively diminished.",

From that soul He created its mate and through them He bestrewed the earth with countless men and women\" (Sura 4:1). This clearly suggests that men and women were created from the same substance. Muslims will point to this as 'proof' that men and women are considered equal in Islam. However, Sura 2:228 states \"Women shall with justice have rights similar to those exercised against them, although men have a status above women.\" However this difference in status runs much deeper. In legal testimony, \"Call in two male witnesses from among you, but if two men cannot be found, then one man and two women whom you judge fit to act as witnesses\" (Sura 2:282), in other words a woman's testimony is worth half of a man's.\n \n Can Muslim women be beaten? \"Good women are obedient. They guard their unseen parts because God has guarded them. As for those from whom you fear disobedience, admonish them and send them to beds apart and beat them\" (Sura 4:34) (though some Islamic scholars claim that this is a symbolic 'beating' only where-by the husband just 'taps' his wife on the arm. Although the wording does not say it should be but a symbolic tap, it should be noted anyway that it still points to male domination over women. (and it is an interpretation that is in the minority)\n \n It is clear that Muhammed 'loved' women, he kept nine wives and numerous concubines. But is this love? What did he invoke his followers to do? \"Omar reported from the Holy Prophet (Muhammed) who said, 'No man shall be questioned for beating his wife.'\" (Al Hadis, Vol. 1, p. 215) \n \"The prophet said: 'When a man calls his wife to bed and she does not come, the husband spends the night being angry with her, and the angels curse her until morning. The one who is in heaven is displeased with her until the husband is pleased with her.'\"(Sahih hadith, chapter 558) \n \n \"The Prophet (Muhammed) said: 'I was shown the Hell-fire and that the majority of its dwellers were women who were ungrateful.' It was asked, 'Do they disbelieve in Allah?' (or are they ungrateful to Allah?) He replied, 'They are ungrateful to their husbands and are ungrateful for the favours and the good (charitable deeds) done to them. If you have always been good (benevolent) to one of them and then she sees something in you (not of her liking), she will say, 'I have never received any good from you.'\" (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 1:2:28) \n \n \"Abu Sayeed al-Khodri reported that Muhammed was talking to a group of women when he said, '... I see the majority of you will go to Hell.' The women asked why, to which Muhammed responded, 'You often curse and are ungrateful to your companions.' He then told them they had a basic defect in their nature, to which they responded, 'How?' Muhammed answered, 'Is not the attestation (knowledge and witness) of a women only worth half of a man's? And that is on account of her short intelligence.'\"(Al-Hadis, Vol. 3, p. 137)\n \n Okay, so these words of Islam were written years ago. What relevance do they have today? Can I remind you that the Koran is seen as the word of their god. To question it is to commit blasphemy. The Haddiths are the doings of Muhammed. Moslems believe that he was the most perfect of men, that his example should be followed. In Islam, women are clearly inferior to Men.\n The list goes on...\n \n \"Allah's Apostle once said to a group of women : 'I have not seen any one more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. A cautious, sensible man could be led astray by some of you.' The women asked: 'O Allah's Apostle, what is deficient in our intelligence and religion?' He said: 'Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?' They replied in the affirmative. He said: 'This is the deficiency of your intelligence' ... 'Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?' The women replied in the affirmative. He said: 'This is the deficiency in your religion.'?Sahih Bukhari, Arabic-English translation, 1 Hadith No. 301. See also vol. 3, Hadith No. 826.\n \"The prophet of Allah said: When a man calls his wife to satisfy his desire, let her come to him though she is occupied at the oven.\"\n Mishkat al-Masabih, English translation, Book I, Section 'Duties of husband and wife', Hadith No. 61\n \n Islam protects children is another claim made. In pre-Islamic Arabia there was the frequent practice of female infanticide; the killing of unwanted female children. Islam stopped this. But how does Islam evoke protection of female children?\n Let?s look at the Haddiths (Volume 7, Book 62, Number 64: Narrated 'Aisha')\n that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old, and then she remained with him for nine years (i.e., till his death).\n Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 64, from http://www.quraan.com\n \n Thus when the Ayatollah Khemani married a ten year old (he was twenty at the time), he was simply following the example of Muhammed?. Yes there are child-marriages going on in non-Muslim areas of the world, but please remember that\n in Islam it is actually supported by their leader. It is done BECAUSE of their religious beliefs.\n Furthermore, \n \"...[T]he Prophet (Muhammed) said to her (Aisha), 'You have been shown to me twice in my dream. I saw you pictured on a piece of silk and someone said (to me). 'This is your wife.' When I uncovered the picture, I saw that it was yours. I said, 'If this is from Allah, it will be done.'\" (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 5:58:235). Remember, that she was only a child. He is fantasising about a little girl.\n \n Thus when the Ayatollah Khemani married a ten year old (he was twenty at the time), he was simply following the example of Muhammed?.

He is the most perfect of men? so to follow his example is actually seen by Moslems as a good thing. One counter-argument to this was that because Muhammed only ever had one child, he couldn?t have possibly had sex with all these females. But, remember, the Haddith of Aisha is quite specific, and it is a Haddith that Muslims teach!",

   "\"The Prophet (Muhammad) said: 'When the slave runs away from his master, his prayer is not accepted; he is an infidel.'\" \n (Hadith No. Muslim 32) \n \n \nPaul says a bit about selling daughters into slavery I think and a few other things fairly oppressive. And the Old Testament is full of this kind of thing with stoning adulterers, raping captured women etc.\n\n \n I am not a Biblical scholar, so if you have the verse, it would be much appreciated. I did attempt to find the verse; I searched www.biblegateway.com under an 'advanced search' by the word 'slave' and searching only the Epistles, and got 48 results. This is too many for me, and as you know which verse(s), it'll be easier for you to just name it/them.\n \n Slavery already existed when Christianity came into existence\n Pagans Plato and Aristotle supported slavery. Aristotle said \"From the hour of their birth some are marked out for subjection, others for rule\" (From \"Politics\" quoted in Carroll, V & Shiflett, D \"Christianity on Trial: Arguments against Anti-Religious Bigotry\" p27) (see http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/anci....html#Aristotle for the context).\n St. Paul I know did say 'slaves be obedient to your masters', but also urged slave-owners to treat their slaves properly. Paul was dealing with a situation that was already existing. However, his 'ideal' is stated when he said \"There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are one in Christ Jesus (Corinthians 12:13). (repeated in Galatians 3:28 - ps I'm getting these quotes from the Christianity on Trial book).\n \n Thus in Romans 8:37No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. 38For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,[13] neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n \n That is, although slavery exists now (at the time of his works), it can't separate you from God, because it is only passing.\n \n Thus we see that slavery, whilst it does exist, is to be but fleeting, and should not be severe, but ultimately, we are all equal before God, where there is no slavery; which is why Christians were leaders in opposing slavery.\n \n David Hume, an atheist, was an advocate for the natural superiority of whites... and Locke, another great 'liberal' helped draft the ordinances for the Carolinas where he gave rights over slaves. Conversely, Christians such as Garrison and Sojourner Truth (in the USA) and William Wilberforce (in the UK) argued on Christian principles that we are all created equal in the image of God.\n \"The anti-slavery forces thought of themselves as cultural combatants, To their mind, the battle lines were drawn between differing worldviews. David Brion Davis notes that the racist language of intellectuals such as Hume \"enabled orthodox Christians to make defence of the Africans a defence of religion itself. John Wesley, for example, called Hume 'the most insolent despiser of truth and virtue who ever appeared in the world', Other antislavery leaders such as James Ramsay and Granville Sharp, \"repeatedly identified the theory of racial inferiority with Hume, Voltaire, and materialistic philosophy in general...\" p31 Ibid.\n \n Secondly, your generalisation about the Old Testament makes two assumptions;\n one is, that the behaviour is justified\n two, that it is not exceptional.\n \n First, for example are the following cases. Lot slept with his two daughters. David had a general killed, so he could sleep with the man's wife. These examples of behaviour are not condoned. They are merely said to have happened, because they did happen. Lot slept with his daughters, it happened. It's not celebrated as the behaviour one should opt for.\n \n David did what he did in spite of the 10 Commandments and was so remorseful that he started writing Psalms.\n \n Secondly, God allowed certain events to happen in certain circumstances. My own Bible knowledge is limited on this, but I do know that I am not a Jew, but a Christian, so I don't abstain from pork, or have slaves etc. Thus this is, I recognise, and incomplete argument.\n \n \nAs for the converts thing, it doesn't surprise you that with all this supposed oppression women make up the majority of people who choose to turn to Islam, not born into it but make a choice. I think in many cases the modern Koran is interpreted much in the same way as the bible or torah and the more extreme and backward sections glossed over. Fundamentalists on both sides obviously don't, the majority not living in fundamentalist theocracies do.\n\n \n I agree totally. When a Mohammedan is representing his religion you might say \"Oh, I heard that the Koran promotes violence\"\n And they'll point to one of the Suras that says be peaceful, and you think you've got it all wrong.\n \n What they don't tell you is that the peaceful verses are abrogated, generally, by more violent proclamations from later in Muhammad's career. Muhammad, when he started out, was full of 'peace' messages. But as his following grew, and after he took control in Medina, his messages become more and more belligerent. When asked about verses that seem to conflict in message, he stated that his god has given him a 'more perfect' verse that should abrogate, or supersede any previous conflicting verses. In fact, Mohammedans believe that their whole religion abrogates Judaism and Christianity.",

But pretty sure there is something along the lines of it being ok to rape someones daughter, as long as you pay their father the equivalent as if you had bought her as a slave or some such.\n \n In the meantime, I am also pretty sure that Jesus said that his message and teachings overruled the ones of Moses and other prophets in the old testament (hence why we can wear clothing of two different materials and shave parts of our beards) and that were hisorical reasonings why the alter sections became more violent as the early muslims were persecuted in Mohammed's life time.

Muhammed is shown to have slept with a child, to have ordered the execution of PoWs, and several individuals who spoke out against him. How on earth you believe that this is anything like what Jesus did is totally beyond me.\n\n \n No, I do not equate Muhammed to Jesus. Muhammed was Muhammed, Jesus was Jesus. They are both in the quran. \n \n We do not know if Jesus slept with children, or if he would have ordered the execution of POWs, that side of the life of jesus is mostly undiscussed in the bible. We know many of his diciples most likely slept with children, since that was not uncommon at the time (differnt definition of \"child\") and we know that some of his diciples were married. It is very likely that they married young girls. There is a better than average chance that Mary was well under the threshold of \"child\" by our definition when Jesus was born.\n \n There is a big difference in how the acts of Muhammed and the acts of Jesus were recorded. Jesus is recorded as, and percieved as divine. Since his is divine, he never makes a mistake, never acts cruelly or in a petty manner, is never violent. He is the son of God and acts accordingly (at least as it is written). Muhammad, on the other hand, is a man, and he is recorded as such (he was considered the most perfect man). He was considered a prophet, not above violence or lust.\n \n We know that the diciples of Jesus carried swords, yet we do not hear about those swords being used (though based on history we have of the time they almost certainly were). The single \"big\" reference we have to the thoughts of Jesus when it comes to the use of these swords was when he told Peter to put down his sword. The interesting thing about that is that taken in context, it does not seem to be a general statement of policy, but more along the lines of \"Put it down, we don't have a chance\" (if you will rememebr, they were facing a \"multitude\" of people).\n \n Now, the swords which were popular at the time were not light,were not comfortable to wear, and they did not have sheathes. You really think those guys were carrying them around for no reason? Think about this one real hard, especially considering that they walked about everywhere they went. \n \n The new testament as we know it was compiled from a huge numebr of similar writings. It was compiled specifically to convey a message of peace and brotherhood. It has been edited many times throughout history. Maybe somewhere in the books which were not included, we woud find references to the diciples using those heavy swords, or references to Jesus marrying a 10 yr old girl (since it would have been incredibly odd and shameful for him to have not been married). We simply do not know.\n \n \n \nThen you say that it's not even worth your effort posting any 'proofs' anyway.\n\n \n It is not. Both religions and both books (the Bible and the Quran) will allow you to walk away with what you wish. People have used the bible to justify some pretty horrific stuff (inquisition, burning people at the stake) the Quran has been used the same way. For every verse in the Bible that calls for peace nad brotherhood, there is one which requires that people be stoned in the street or burned at the stake. \n \n It is all in how you look at things, and what emphasis you wish to put on it. PErsonally, when I read the bible, the message I get is be nice to people, try to live a good life, try to be a nice guy. This is what I came away from reading the bible with, despite the huge list of things that require stoning in the street as punishment or other similarly nasty deaths. Reading the Quran, I come away with the same message, though there is slightly more emphasis on treating people fairly and standing up for your beliefs.\n \n Now, Hitler used the Bible to justify death camps, and the KKK used it to justify the murder of blacks, and white supremacists even today continue using it to justify their racist agendas. The church used it to justify the inquisition, the crusades, and thousands of murders throughout history (pretty much all of the dark ages). \n \n Does this mean that the Bible calls for the blood of innocents? Of course not, it simply means that you take what you wish from it, and if people really want to find hate and bloodshed there, they will.\n \n Some radical muslims have read the Quran and found hate and bloodshed there. This is too bad. They are a VERY small percentage of the total muslim populaiton. You don;t condemn the entire religion fo the acts of a few. \n \n \nIslam is about submitting to Islam. You either join it, or you are killed/persecuted.\n\n \n Islam is a word in the Arab language having two meanings. On eis submission, as to submission to the will of god. The otehr is \"peace\" as it realted to pacifism.\n \n Isalm is about submitting to the will of God, just like christianity. \n \n The only place in the world where there is a problem with Muslims persecuting non-muslims is in the radical theocracies of the ME. Even there, visiting Christians and Jews can generally count on Muslim hospitality form most of the population. Unlike Christianity which proclaims that there is one god, the Christican god, and everybody else is going to hell, the Muslims believe that there is one god and most of the other religions worship that same god, so they must be respected. \n \n There are of course some muslims out there who believe that other religions are just wrong and those who follow them are evil. There are christians who believe the same thing (like you). You are both wrong.\n \n Frankly, I have a great deal of trouble placing you in the \"Christian\" category. I certainly hope there are not too many Christians out there like you. I don't seem to remember Jesus preaching hate or intolerance.\n \n Just out of curiosity, what is your view on Jews? Traditionally, Christians have hated Jews, often killing them outright in the name of god (they did kill Jesus after all).",

Muhammad is shown to have slept with a child, to have ordered the execution of PoWs, and several individuals who spoke out against him. How on earth you believe that this is anything like what Jesus did is totally beyond me. \n\n \n \nNo, I do not equate Muhammad to Jesus. Muhammad was Muhammad, Jesus was Jesus. They are both in the Koran. \n\n \n The Jesus in the Koran is not the same Jesus in the Bible. For someone who claims to be Catholic you have a very un-Christian view of Jesus. I very much doubt you are a practicing Christian.\n \n Further, I have presented evidences, you present none.\n \n \nWe do not know if Jesus slept with children, or if he would have ordered the execution of POWs, that side of the life of Jesus is mostly undiscussed in the bible. We know many of his disciples most likely slept with children, since that was not uncommon at the time (different definition of \"child\") and we know that some of his disciples were married. It is very likely that they married young girls. There is a better than average chance that Mary was well under the threshold of \"child\" by our definition when Jesus was born.\n\n \n What a bizarre argument you now put. We have no evidence of Jesus and his disciples doing something, BUT He might well have. You say you aren't comparing Jesus and Muhammad, then you make exactly that sort of argument; that we have evidence of Muhammad sleeping with a child, and that even though we don't for Jesus, He might well have. This is supposition again, rather than proof. If we ARE to judge Jesus by His words, then He says \"Bless the children\", Muhammad actually slept with one. We know that as a fact. I am making an argument on what we know. You are making an argument on what you would like.\n \n The idea is appalling of yours, anyway. Christians fought against child prostitution right from the earliest days; because we count all people to be in the image of God; even the unborn to be human. It's one of the things that set them apart, and made them despised of by pagans who often had temple boys and girls.\n \n \nThere is a big difference in how the acts of Muhammad and the acts of Jesus were recorded. Jesus is recorded as, and perceived as divine. Since his is divine, he never makes a mistake, never acts cruelly or in a petty manner, is never violent. He is the son of God and acts accordingly (at least as it is written). Muhammad, on the other hand, is a man, and he is recorded as such (he was considered the most perfect man). He was considered a prophet, not above violence or lust.\n\n \n Your illogical argument continues here because you ignore the fact that Mohammedans believe that Muhammad is the most perfect of men! You missed that one too! They believe he is the very model of humanity!\n The Lord of the universe, The Most Merciful and Compassionate sent about 124,000 prophets and messengers to every nook and corner of this earth to guide humanity towards understanding the purpose of its creation and thereby surrender to His Divine Laws and achieve its final destiny of Eternal Peace in His Paradise. The last messenger of God who brought His last revelation the Holy Quraan to humanity is Muhammad bin 'Abdullah, born in Mekkah, approximately 550 years after Jesus, son of Mary, peace and blessings of God be on them both. This is the account of this last Messenger of God, the most remarkable man, that human history has known.\n http://www.daar-ul-ehsaan.org/truth/must.htm\n \n \"The Prophet accomplished all this through the strength of his character and personal example;\"\n http://www.missionislam.com/youth/muhammad.htm \n Mohammedans argue that even today, he is still a role-model! Even here I can use how Mohammedans view him; you would use supposition. They even give him a special blessing each time they mention him; unique to him!\n \n Look at what one Mohammedan site says... he implies he'd marry his child off!\n \"Any marriage is considered as legal and successful, if the three conditions hold good.\n The marriage should have the blessings of one/both parents.\n State/Society should not take any offense and acknowledge the matrimony.\n None of the spouses should live to repent or convey his/her displeasure at the decision of his/her parents/guardians to bind him/her in such an alliance, long after the marriage has taken place. The husband and wife should be happy of being married with each other, till they die.\n None of the three and especially the last one, seem to have been defied or negated by the marriage of the prophet with Ayesha (ra).  I wouldn't mind marrying off my daughter or sister, if all the three conditions get satisfied and she doesn't live on to repent this decision taken by me on her behalf.\"\n http://www.guidedones.com/metapage/frq/Aishara.htm\n \n As I mentioned earlier too, that's why the Ayatollah Khomeini was able to marry a 10 year old girl, when he was 20. It is because he is following the 'model' example of Muhammad.\n \n So, now you're faced with the problem of explaining why Mohammedans recorded the fact that he slept with a child in the first place. They did so because he is their model man, and anything he did was believed to be blessed. We know this, because Mohammedans recorded this fact of his life! Mohammedans thought, too, that when he killed PoWs, or urged the breaking of treaties (with non-believers) it was the 'right' thing to do, some might have thought in fact that it was rather clever, to lull one's enemy into a false sense of security, and then BAM!\n \n \nWe know that the disciples of Jesus carried swords, yet we do not hear about those swords being used (though based on history we have of the time they almost certainly were). The single \"big\" reference we have to the thoughts of Jesus when it comes to the use of these swords was when he told Peter to put down his sword. The interesting thing about that is that taken in context, it does not seem to be a general statement of policy, but more along the lines of \"Put it down, we don't have a chance\" (if you will remember, they were facing a \"multitude\" of people).\n\n \n Yes, again you offer supposition. You argue: 'If we know what is written, then something else might have happened.'\n \n \nNow, the swords which were popular at the time were not light,were not comfortable to wear, and they did not have sheathes. You really think those guys were carrying them around for no reason? Think about this one real hard, especially considering that they walked about everywhere they went. \n\n \n Supposition. We have evidence for one thing, but surely they must have done something else!\n \n \nThe new testament as we know it was compiled from a huge number of similar writings. It was compiled specifically to convey a message of peace and brotherhood. It has been edited many times throughout history. Maybe somewhere in the books which were not included, we would find references to the disciples using those heavy swords, or references to Jesus marrying a 10 yr old girl (since it would have been incredibly odd and shameful for him to have not been married). We simply do not know.\n\n \n How odd again. We don't know Jesus did this unspeakable act, but maybe He did? Your argument is very anti-Christian that you would make such suppositions based simply on you wishing to make relative the acts of Muhammad to Jesus. Further to that, we have very early writings of the Bible... go to www.earlychristianwritings.com to see.\n \n \n Then you say that it's not even worth your effort posting any 'proofs' anyway. \n\n \n \nIt is not. Both religions and both books (the Bible and the Koran) will allow you to walk away with what you wish. People have used the bible to justify some pretty horrific stuff (inquisition, burning people at the stake) the Koran has been used the same way.\n\n \n So, when Jesus says \"Put down your sword\" and people interpret this by killing people, it makes it relative to when Muhammad says \"Pick up your sword\" and people interpret this by killing people.\n \n Your argument here is nonsensical. If I tell you to do something, evoking you to a hateful act, and you do it, we are both guilty. If I didn't urge you, and you did it, then I am totally blameless for your actions. Likewise, Jesus is totally blameless if people take the wrong message out of His words. When Mohammedans kill non-believers they can call on the words of Muhammad.\n \n \nFor every verse in the Bible that calls for peace nad brotherhood, there is one which requires that people be stoned in the street or burned at the stake. \n\n \n Show me the comparison. Oh, that's right, you don't have to, or it's not worth your while.\n \n \nIt is all in how you look at things, and what emphasis you wish to put on it. PErsonally, when I read the bible, the message I get is be nice to people, try to live a good life, try to be a nice guy. This is what I came away from reading the bible with, despite the huge list of things that require stoning in the street as punishment or other similarly nasty deaths. Reading the Koran, I come away with the same message, though there is slightly more emphasis on treating people fairly and standing up for your beliefs.\n\n \n No, the treating people fairly in the Koran is limited to treating fellow Muslim men okay. Jesus not only says love thy neighbour, regardless of who it is, He says \"love thy enemies\" and forgive your enemies 7 x 77 times!\n \n \nNow, Hitler used the Bible to justify death camps, and the KKK used it to justify the murder of blacks, and white supremacists even today continue using it to justify their racist agendas. The church used it to justify the inquisition, the crusades, and thousands of murders throughout history (pretty much all of the dark ages). \n\n \n Oh that old chestnut. Where again, are the passages Hitler used? What teachings of Christ do the KKK use? Oh, again, you don't need to prove that.\n \n \nDoes this mean that the Bible calls for the blood of innocents? Of course not, it simply means that you take what you wish from it, and if people really want to find hate and bloodshed there, they will.\n\n \n This sort of argument makes me realise you're not a practicing Catholic. Catholics, and Orthodox (which I am one) agree on this point, you don't take away from the Bible what you want to! The interpretation of the Bible is not up to the individual to decide, but rather the collective wisdom of our respective churches. You obviously missed that one; it's why Protestants took the exact path you proclaim - individual reading and interpretation/\n \n \nSome radical muslims have read the Koran and found hate and bloodshed there. This is too bad. They are a VERY small percentage of the total muslim population. You don't condemn the entire religion fo the acts of a few. \n\n \n I condemn the religion based on the beliefs of the religion. You argue here that a few Mohammedans just happen to find hate 'somewhere' in the Koran is truly a remarkable feat of re-working the Koran. The Koran, and the Haddiths are resplendent with examples. They follow the example of Muhammad himself, their ideal man\n \n \n Islam is about submitting to Islam. You either join it, or you are killed/persecuted. \n\n \n \nIslam is a word in the Arab language having two meanings. On eis submission, as to submission to the will of god. The other is \"peace\" as it related to pacifism.\n\n \n Islam is about submitting to the will of God, just like Christianity. \n \n \nThe only place in the world where there is a problem with Muslims persecuting non-muslims is in the radical theocracies of the ME. Even there, visiting Christians and Jews can generally count on Muslim hospitality form most of the population.\n\n \n If you go to most nations, people are hospitable towards foreigners (except France). If you go to a Muslim nation, and you want to preach Christianity, you are likely to find that hospitality taken away. In the west though, the reverse is not true. You can be arrested in Saudi Arabia, if you have a cross that can be easily seen.\n \n \nUnlike Christianity which proclaims that there is one god, the Christian god, and everybody else is going to hell, the Muslims believe that there is one god and most of the other religions worship that same god, so they must be respected. \n\n \n Show me the Orthodox teaching that says what you think it says.\n \n \nThere are of course some muslims out there who believe that other religions are just wrong and those who follow them are evil. There are Christians who believe the same thing (like you). You are both wrong.\n\n \n So there is no evil? You don't think sleeping with a child is evil?\n \n \nFrankly, I have a great deal of trouble placing you in the \"Christian\" category. I certainly hope there are not too many Christians out there like you. I don't seem to remember Jesus preaching hate or intolerance.\n\n \n Have you heard me advocating killing anyone here? I will not tolerate a religion that has as it's ideal, a man who slept with a child. Where does Jesus say that I should not speak out against injustice?\n \n http://www.persecution.com/ shows persecution going on (although it's a Protestant site). You would condemn them for speaking out, because they hate intolerance!\n A very warped world-view. \n \n \nJust out of curiosity, what is your view on Jews? Traditionally, Christians have hated Jews, often killing them outright in the name of god (they did kill Jesus after all).\n\n \n Did the Jews kill Jesus? I thought the Romans did. Obviously you're reading a different Bible. Show me the Bible passage you're thinking of.\n \n In summary, you claim you're not comparing the two; Jesus and Muhammad - but then you do exactly that. And most shocking of all, when the Bible says one thing happened, your supposition is that something else might have happened! You make sweeping statements about Hitler and the KKK in relation to Christianity, offering nothing again but your own misplaced opinion - misplaced because you know full well, that Christ never advocated anything that the Nazis of KKK envisioned.\n \n You claim you are Catholic, but the evidence; by what you argue about how we read the Bible suggest that you're not, or that you missed a major argument.\n \n You offer a Mohammedan apologist argument based on supposition and opinion, ignoring how Muhammedans themselves view him and wrote about him; the suggestion you make is in fact anti-Islamic; that they were inaccurate in their accounts of his life",

Further to that, we have very early writings of the Bible... go to www.earlychristianwritings.com to see.\n\n \n Actually, I was speaking more to the fact that the bible is pretty short on personal details of the life of Jesus. If you want to read the bible and say \"that is all jesus ever did...nothing ewlse ever happened\" then that is fine. He lived about 6 years, ate very rarely, and NEVER in the course of his entire life did he efer go to the bathroom. Muhhomad went to the bathroom, we know because it is mentioned in the Quran. Not only did Jesus never got o the bathroom, neither did any of his diciples. interesting....\n \n The new testament is designed to convey a very specific message. An6ything outside of that message is not included. You do not need to hear about Jesus going ot the bathroom, you can just assume he did. We also do not ever hear of his diciples using swords on anybody (beyond the ear incident). We can assume that since they carried them, there must have been some reason for it. \n \n The bible just doesn't give that much information. Sorry. \n \n \n \nSo, when Jesus says \"Put down your sword\" and people interpret this by killing people, it makes it relative to when Muhammad says \"Pick up your sword\" and people interpret this by killing people.\n \n Your argument here is nonsensical. If I tell you to do something, evoking you to a hateful act, and you do it, we are both guilty. If I didn't urge you, and you did it, then I am totally blameless for your actions. Likewise, Jesus is totally blameless if people take the wrong message out of His words. When Mohammedans kill non-believers they can call on the words of Muhammad.\n\n \n \n See, now your bible must be different from mine. Mine has 2 books, the old testament and the new testament all in one big book. yours is not the same? Or perhapse you prefer to focus soley on the new testament? \n \n In many cases, the \"words of Muhommad\" they use to justify their actions are mis interpeted. So, islam is blameless in such cases, right?\n \n \n \nShow me the comparison. Oh, that's right, you don't have to, or it's not worth your while.\n\n \n And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.\n \n And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.\n \n -Exodus 12:29-30\n \n The LORD is a man of war. . .\n \n -Exodus 15:3\n \n And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain.\n \n -Deuteronomy 2:34\n \n Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ***.\n \n -I Samuel 15:3\n \n Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.\n \n -Psalm 140:10\n \n I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.\n \n -Isaiah 45:7\n \n Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up: Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.\n \n -Joel 3:9-10\n \n Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.\n \n -Jesus in Matthew 10:34\n \n If my kingdom were from this world, my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews.\n \n -Jesus in John 18:36 [NRSV]\n \n And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.\n \n For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.\n \n -Jesus in Mark 13:7-8\n \n But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.\n \n -Jesus in Luke 19:27\n \n \n \n \nNo, the treating people fairly in the Koran is limited to treating fellow Muslim men okay. Jesus not only says love thy neighbour, regardless of who it is, He says \"love thy enemies\" and forgive your enemies 7 x 77 times!\n\n \n No, it is not just limited to treating fellow Muslim men okay. \n \n \"Not one of you is a believer until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.\" Fourth Hadith of an-Nawawi 13\n \n \n \nOh that old chestnut. Where again, are the passages Hitler used? What teachings of Christ do the KKK use? Oh, again, you don't need to prove that.\n\n \n Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord.\n \n -Hitler (Mein Kampf)\n \n I am absolutely convinced of the great power and the deep significance of the Christian religion, and consequently will not permit any other founders of religion (Religionsstifter). Therefore I have turned against Ludendoriff and separated myself from him; therefore I reject Rosenberg's book. That book is written by a Protestant. It is not a party book. It is not written by him as a member of the party. The Protestants can settle matters with him. \n \n My desire is that no confessional conflict arise. I must act correctly to both confessions. I will not tolerate a Kulturkampf.... I stand by my word. I will protect the rights and freedom of the church and will not permit them to be touched. You need have no apprehensions concerning the freedom of the church. \n \n -Hitler [quoted from Helmreich, p.241] \n \n Except the Lord built the house they labour in vain.... The truth of that text was proved if one looks at the house of which the foundations were laid in 1918 and which since then has been in building.... The world will not help, the people must help itself. Its own strength is the source of life. That strength the Almighty has given us to use; that in it and through it we may wage the battle of our life.... The others in the past years have not had the blessing of the Almighty-- of Him Who in the last resort, whatever man may do, holds in His hands the final decision. Lord God, let us never hesitate or play the coward, let us never forget the duty which we have taken upon us.... We are all proud that through God's powerful aid we have become once more true Germans.\n \n -Adolf Hitler, in a speech in March 1933 [Baynes] (misquoting psalm 127)\n \n He used Genisis 1:26 (man in the likeness of god) as fuel for his racial policies (as have the KKK). He was concerend that interacial marriages were destroying gods image:\n \n But if out of smugness, or even cowardice, this battle is not fought to its end, then take a look at the peoples five hundred years from now. I think you will find but few images of God, unless you want to profane the Almighty.\n \n -Adolf Hitler (Mein Kampf)\n \n \n \n \nThis sort of argument makes me realise you're not a practicing Catholic. Catholics, and Orthodox (which I am one) agree on this point, you don't take away from the Bible what you want to! The interpretation of the Bible is not up to the individual to decide, but rather the collective wisdom of our respective churches. You obviously missed that one; it's why Protestants took the exact path you proclaim - individual reading and interpretation/\n\n \n You would be surprised how progressive the catholic church has become in this. Our priest tells us every sunday \"Read the bible and take from it what you can\". From a realistic standpoint, this makes quite a bit of sense. The church does not want to see its members carrying out old testament style punishments. Even in the new testament, tehre are quite a few things that we prefer to gloss over. \n \n What about the luthrans, who split from the church because of corruption in the church (If I rememebr correctyl, the pope was sleeping with 12 yr old prosititutes).\n \n Pls don't try to class yourself in with the Catholics. The Pope has called for tolerance and brotherhood between muslims and catholics a half dozen times in the last few years. \n \n Islam is about submitting to the will of God, just like Christianity. \n \n \nIf you go to most nations, people are hospitable towards foreigners (except France). If you go to a Muslim nation, and you want to preach Christianity, you are likely to find that hospitality taken away. In the west though, the reverse is not true. You can be arrested in Saudi Arabia, if you have a cross that can be easily seen.\n\n \n I have done quite a bit of traveling, including to the middle east, and they are as tolerate and hospitable to foreigners as anywhere. The most inhospitable country on the planet to foreigners is probably Japan, where they smale while they call you a monkey. \n \n Yes, if you go to the ME planning to convert people, you are likely to meet with no small amount of unpleasantness. Luckily, most Muslims don;t klive int he Middle East.\n \n \n \nShow me the Orthodox teaching that says what you think it says.\n\n \n I know very little of \"orthodox\" teachings. I am familiar with the Catholic and Luthran version of things (my fatehr was a Luthran). Most \"orthodox\" Christians I have met have been totalitarin jerks, with the exception of some greek orthodox.\n \n \n \nSo there is no evil? You don't think sleeping with a child is evil?\n\n \n Of course there is evil, and by todays standards, sleeping with a child is an evil act. By the standards of the time, and standards of some modern nations, childhood stops at about 7 or 8.\n \n \n \n \nDid the Jews kill Jesus? I thought the Romans did. Obviously you're reading a different Bible. Show me the Bible passage you're thinking of.\n\n \n Hmmm, I was sure that it was the priests that took Jesus to pilot to be tried, and there was that whole thing about pilot washing his hands of the whole mess.....\n \n \nIn summary, you claim you're not comparing the two; Jesus and Muhammad - but then you do exactly that. And most shocking of all, when the Bible says one thing happened, your supposition is that something else might have happened! You make sweeping statements about Hitler and the KKK in relation to Christianity, offering nothing again but your own misplaced opinion - misplaced because you know full well, that Christ never advocated anything that the Nazis of KKK envisioned.\n\n \n Nope, still not comparing Jesus and Muhommad. And I am not supposing that things that are written in the bible did not happen. I am simply applying common sense to the situation and saying that there was obviously a lot of stuff goin on that wasn't recorded in the bible.\n \n \n \nYou claim you are Catholic, but the evidence; by what you argue about how we read the Bible suggest that you're not, or that you missed a major argument.\n\n \n You are wrong. this is a lot of typing. fingers starting to cramp up. Will answer the rest of this utter BS later.",

   "Part 1 of 2 begins\n Note too, that I go quickly over the Old Testament 'evidences' Daewoo uses, because I am most unfamiliar with it in the regards he uses.\n \n \nThe Jesus in the Koran is not the same Jesus in the Bible. For someone who claims to be Catholic you have a very un-Christian view of Jesus. I very much doubt you are a practicing Christian.\n\n \n \nYes, the Jesus in the Quran is the exact same Jesus that they talk about in the bible. The Christmas story is in the Quran. They are two different viewpoints of the same guy.\n\n \n This simply is not true. Jesus is the Son of God in the Bible. In the Koran, He's just a prophet. One has Him as God, the other as human. If you think there's no difference, then I can't help you. Even the notion of God for Christians is different from that of Mohammedans. We believe in a loving triune God, they believe in a deceitful being called al-lah\n This is done to deceive you, because it is permissible. In fact, Allah will deceive people (albeit those that try to deceive him)\n [Sura 4.142] Surely the hypocrites strive to deceive Allah, and He shall requite their deceit to them, and when they stand up to prayer they stand up sluggishly; they do it only to be seen of men and do not remember Allah save a little.\n http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/k/kora...IV0&byte=114839\n Dawood's translation actually reads\n \"The hypocrites seek to deceive God, but it is He who deceives them.\"\n \n \n Further, I have presented evidences, you present none. \n\n \n \nI think I made it cler (sic) from the start I am not going to waste time researching this. It is not worth it.\n\n \n Powerful argument! Yet you do present some out of context quotes below, obviously you've got a stock of them on hand.\n \n \nAs far as I am concerned, \"orthodox\" Christians (which in your case seems to be a substitute for \"Christian fundamentalist\") such as yourslef (sic) are no better than the Muslim extremists. \n\n \n Yes, I can see from your pattern of comparing white to black you'd make this assumption. Whereas I've advocated killing no one, that is exactly the same as someone who blows up a bus. Exactly, in your eyes, but not in reality.\n \n \n What a bizarre argument you now put. We have no evidence of Jesus and his disciples doing something, BUT He might well have. You say you aren't comparing Jesus and Muhammad, then you make exactly that sort of argument; that we have evidence of Muhammad sleeping with a child, and that even though we don't for Jesus, He might well have. This is supposition again, rather than proof. If we ARE to judge Jesus by His words, then He says \"Bless the children\", Muhammad actually slept with one. We know that as a fact. I am making an argument on what we know. You are making an argument on what you would like. \n\n \n \nNo, actually I was drawing a conclusion based on what we know about social values from that time.\n\n \n Then why didn't Jesus say 'relativist' stuff?\n Matthew 5:43\n \"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbour[1] and hate your enemy.' 44But I tell you: Love your enemies[2] and pray for those who persecute you,\"\n \n He is referring to the Old Testament Lev. 19:18, but he's going beyond that!\n \n \n The idea is appalling of yours, anyway. Christians fought against child prostitution right from the earliest days; because we count all people to be in the image of God; even the unborn to be human. It's one of the things that set them apart, and made them despised of by pagans who often had temple boys and girls. \n\n \n \nChristians founght (sic) against ALL prostitution, not just child prostitution. \n\n \n I won't argue against that. I am glad to be corrected on that. But obviously this contradicts your notions that they were just relativist morals. Obviously Christians stood apart!\n \n \n Your illogical argument continues here because you ignore the fact that Mohammedans believe that Muhammad is the most perfect of men! You missed that one too! They believe he is the very model of humanity! \n\n \n \nActually, I think I did say something about that. Yes, here it is:\n Muhammad, on the other hand, is a man, and he is recorded as such (he was considered the most perfect man). \n I didn't \"miss\" that. He WAS considered the most perfect man. He is not generally percieved (sic) as ultimatly (sic) perfect, though, as no man can be.\n\n \n No, you were just arguing a post ago that we have to look at how the followers of Jesus and Muhammad viewed each man, so Jesus didn't make mistakes (that are recorded - your theory is that they edited or omitted these), whereas Muhammad was just a man, therefore they included his. But that doesn't hold up because Mohammedans don't think his sleeping with a child is a mistake. They don't condemn this in any Mohammedan literature that I'm aware of.\n \n \nThe Lord of the universe, The Most Merciful and Compassionate sent about 124,000 prophets and messengers to every nook and corner of this earth to guide humanity towards understanding the purpose of its creation and thereby surrender to His Divine Laws and achieve its final destiny of Eternal Peace in His Paradise. The last messenger of God who brought His last revelation the Holy Quraan to humanity is Muhammad bin 'Abdullah, born in Mekkah, approximately 550 years after Jesus, son of Mary, peace and blessings of God be on them both. This is the account of this last Messenger of God, the most remarkable man, that human history has known.\n http://www.daar-ul-ehsaan.org/truth/must.htm \n\n \n \nYes, the most remarkable man that history has ever know. Does not say \"perfect in every way\"\n\n \n Tell me then, do Muslims believe his sleeping with a child is a mistake? No!\n \n \n \"The Prophet accomplished all this through the strength of his character and personal example;\"\n http://www.missionislam.com/youth/muhammad.htm \n Mohammedans argue that even today, he is still a role-model! Even here I can use how Mohammedans view him; you would use supposition. They even give him a special blessing each time they mention him; unique to him! \n\n \n \nAgian (sic), they are not calling him perfect. They are saying he had strength of character.\n\n \n Yes, and he killed PoWs, applauded assignations, kept 9 wives instead of 4 (plus many concubines), took a percent of every raid, and slept with a child. Each of these things they approve of.\n \n \nLook at what one Mohammedan site says... he implies he'd marry his child off!\n \"Any marriage is considered as legal and successful, if the three conditions hold good.\n The marriage should have the blessings of one/both parents.\n State/Society should not take any offence and acknowledge the matrimony.\n None of the spouses should live to repent or convey his/her displeasure at the decision of his/her parents/guardians to bind him/her in such an alliance, long after the marriage has taken place. The husband and wife should be happy of being married with each other, till they die.\n None of the three and especially the last one, seem to have been defied or negated by the marriage of the prophet with Ayesha (ra). I wouldn't mind marrying off my daughter or sister, if all the three conditions get satisfied and she doesn't live on to repent this decision taken by me on her behalf.\"\n http://www.guidedones.com/metapage/frq/Aishara.htm \n\n \n \nI would marry my daughter off if I knew that society accepted it and she would never regret it and be happy with it until the day she died. If more people paid attention to this, maybe we wouldn't see so many divorces.\n\n \n Yes, in the 1850s in western nations women might have had no or little real recourse to divorce, and might be used and beaten by their husbands, we should go back to that, because as you say, it was 'respectable' for the times. For you, each ensuing age has it's own morality. Oddly enough, not even Mohammedans would argue that one!\n \n \nAs I mentioned earlier too, that's why the Ayatollah Khomeini was able to marry a 10 year old girl, when he was 20. It is because he is following the 'model' example of Muhammad. \n\n \n \nThis is a problem with orthodoxy in any religion. Most religions have been around for a long time, and times change. At the time of Muhammad, marrying a girl of 9 or 10 was no big deal, it was a standard practice. Often, arranged marriages took place much earlier than this. Life spans were much shorter, so people got going sooner. \n\n \n So, you're again using an argument here that is totally lacking of understanding things the way Mohammedans view things.. Mohammedans would not argue that Muhammad's morals were 'relative' to his times, but as a beacon for all time. Even when you make apologetic arguments for Muhammad, you insult their world-view. They believe that no other teachings after him are necessary, so complete are they.\n \n \n So, now you're faced with the problem of explaining why Mohammedans recorded the fact that he slept with a child in the first place. They did so because he is their model man, and anything he did was believed to be blessed. We know this, because Mohammedans recorded this fact of his life! Mohammedans thought, too, that when he killed PoWs, or urged the breaking of treaties (with non-believers) it was the 'right' thing to do, some might have thought in fact that it was rather clever, to lull one's enemy into a false sense of security, and then BAM! \n\n \n \nThey did so for exactly the reasons you stated, they felt he was a model man. \n\n \n And, they still do. It's not 'relative'. Muhammad's prophecies etc were final, for all time. Not just for his own time. That is how they view it, it is why they live the way they do.\n \n \n Yes, again you offer supposition. You argue: 'If we know what is written, then something else might have happened.'\n Supposition. We have evidence for one thing, but surely they must have done something else!\n How odd again. We don't know Jesus did this unspeakable act, but maybe He did? Your argument is very anti-Christian that you would make such suppositions based simply on you wishing to make relative the acts of Muhammad to Jesus. Further to that, we have very early writings of the Bible... go to www.earlychristianwritings.com to see. \n\n \n \nActually, I was speaking more to the fact that the bible is pretty short on personal details of the life of Jesus. If you want to read the bible and say \"that is all Jesus ever did...nothing ewlse (sic) ever happened\" then that is fine. He lived about 6 years, ate very rarely, and NEVER in the course of his entire life did he efer (sic) go to the bathroom. Muhammad went to the bathroom, we know because it is mentioned in the Quran. Not only did Jesus never got to the bathroom, neither did any of his diciples.(sic) interesting....\n\n \n Again you show your lack of Catholicity. Orthodox and Catholics don't believe in just the teachings of the Bible, but in Holy Tradition. Holy Tradition will give you information about Mary's parents, Anna and Joachim, and what Mary did after the crucifixition, where John lived etc.\n \n If you have a particular problem with Jesus' toileting habits, please let me know.\n \n \nThe new testament is designed to convey a very specific message. An6ything (sic) outside of that message is not included. You do not need to hear about Jesus going to the bathroom, you can just assume he did. We also do not ever hear of his diciples (sic) using swords on anybody (beyond the ear incident). We can assume that since they carried them, there must have been some reason for it. \n\n \n But did they use them? The only time we know they did, what was Jesus' reaction? The only time we know that they were carried, was in relation to Jesus arrest. Let's go by what we do know, not by what we hope to believe happened.\n \n \nThe bible just doesn't give that much information. Sorry. \n\n \n I really don't believe your Catholic claims when you say things like this. It's now one of two major elements of faith you've missed on.\n a) not reading the Bible to make your own personal interpretation\n b) not relying solely on the teachings of the Bible\n \n Not only do you not know your own faith, you don't seem to be arguing about Islam as Mohammedans would view their faith. There is enough from the teachings of the Bible, and from Holy Tradition.\n \n We know Jesus told His followers to put away their swords. We know that His followers, from Stephen onwards died like martyrs, not killing people, but steadfastly proclaiming the unviversal message of love and hope.\n \n \nSo, when Jesus says \"Put down your sword\" and people interpret this by killing people, it makes it relative to when Muhammad says \"Pick up your sword\" and people interpret this by killing people.\n \n Your argument here is nonsensical. If I tell you to do something, evoking you to a hateful act, and you do it, we are both guilty. If I didn't urge you, and you did it, then I am totally blameless for your actions. Likewise, Jesus is totally blameless if people take the wrong message out of His words. When Mohammedans kill non-believers they can call on the words of Muhammad. \n\n \n \nSee, now your bible must be different from mine. Mine has 2 books, the old testament and the new testament all in one big book. yours is not the same? Or perhapse (sic) you prefer to focus solely on the new testament? \n\n \n We Orthodox focus on the teaching of Christ. We are 'Christian'.\n \n \nIn many cases, the \"words of Muhammad\" they use to justify their actions are miss interpreted. So, Islam is blameless in such cases, right?\n\n \n It would be if they misinterpreted his words. But when he tells people to kill non-believers, and in fact did so himself, then you'd have to close your eyes to assume he meant something else.\n \n \nShow me the comparison. Oh, that's right, you don't have to, or it's not worth your while. \n\n \n \nAnd it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.\n \n And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.\n -Exodus 12:29-30\n \n etc etc etc\n\n \n Yes, the Old Testament is full of history of such events; I am not a follower of the Old Testament; excepting in how it is relative to the teachings of Christ. Tell me where did Jesus order his followers to be deadly towards non-believers? Oh, that's it, you're about to...\n \n \nThink not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.\n -Jesus in Matthew 10:34\n\n \n Yes, he means a figurative sword, because those who follow Him will fight for the faith. How did they do this? Just look at Stephen. He stood up to his accusers, but did he advocate violence even as they stoned him to death? Obviously the first followers of Jesus picked up a totally different interpretation than what you do, because they died for their faith, not kill for their faith. We can look to the words of His, and how His followers lived them and we see that Jesus taught peace, and those that followed Him died without killing.\n \n \nIf my kingdom were from this world, my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews.\n -Jesus in John 18:36 [NRSV]\n\n \n This verse you add shows a complete lack of understanding about what He is saying. He is saying that His kingdom is not of this earth! If He were an earthly king, earthly armies might rise to defend Him. But He is not an earthly king, therefore, by this very fact swords aren't necessary, because they don't help defend an extra-earthly kingdon.\n \n \n And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.\n\n \n This is probably the single biggest indicator that you are posting verses without any idea what they mean. He is saying that there will be wars, but don't worry about them. Is He advocating war? No. It is akin to a newspaper predicting an oil price rise. Predicting it, is not advocating it.\n \n \nFor nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.\n -Jesus in Mark 13:7-8\n\n \n ditto.\n \n \nBut those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.\n -Jesus in Luke 19:27\n\n \n Again Jesus isn't advocating war. He's relaying a story, of what someone else said.\n \n \nNo, the treating people fairly in the Koran is limited to treating fellow Muslim men okay. Jesus not only says love thy neighbour, regardless of who it is, He says \"love thy enemies\" and forgive your enemies 7 x 77 times! \n\n \n \nNo, it is not just limited to treating fellow Muslim men okay. \n \"Not one of you is a believer until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.\" Fourth Hadith of an-Nawawi 13\n\n \n Yes, and brother means a fellow-Muslim! Who is my brother'? would be a question to ask (reflecting the question to Jesus of 'who is my neighbour')\n The next mention of the word 'brother' in that Haddith might give you a clue...\n \"Do not envy one another; do not inflate prices one to another; do not hate one another; do not turn away from one another; and do not undercut one another, but be you, TO servants of Allah, brothers.\"\n That is, a brother, is one who is a co-religionist. This is much more a restricted use then 'neighbour' is in the Christian sense, where Jesus says ALL men are my brother, not just those that believe as I do.\n \n Again, the next use of the word 'brother'\n \"Do not envy one another; do not inflate prices one to another; do not hate one another; do not turn away from one another; and do not undercut one another, but be you, TO servants of Allah, brothers. A Muslim is the brother of a Muslim: he neither oppresses him nor does he fail him, he neither lies to him nor does he hold him in contempt. Piety is right here-and he pointed to his breast three times. It is evil enough for a man to hold his brother Muslim in contempt. The whole of a Muslim for another Muslim is inviolable: his blood, his property, and his honour.\"\n \n So, there is no universal in the sense that Jesus used, therefore I am correct in saying that the Muslims do not have the same sense of it.\n All quotes from http://mac.abc.se/home/onesr/ez/hdth/40h-naw_e.html\n \n Part 1 of 2 ends",

Pure Christianity - the Christianity of the catacombs - is concerned with translating the Christian doctrine into fact. It leads simply to the annihilation of mankind. It is merely wholehearted Bolshevism, under the tinsel of metaphysics\".\n quoted in \"Christianity on Trial: Arguments against anti-religious bigotry\", Carroll, V, and Shiflett, D, p115.\n \n Hardly sounds like he thought that he was.\n *\n Leading Nazi, Alfred Rosenberg wrote \"The Myth of the Twentieth Century\", in which he said \"The Christian-Jewish plague must perish\".\n \n One of the acts of the Nazi party was to abolish the Catholic German Centre Party.\n \n \nHe used Genesis 1:26 (man in the likeness of god) as fuel for his racial policies (as have the KKK). He was concerend (sic) that interacial (sic) marriages were destroying gods image:\n\n \n Huh? Where does Christ say that we are greater men then the Jews? You say he used Genesis, but you only have him talking of the image of god.. which one?\n \n \nBut if out of smugness, or even cowardice, this battle is not fought to its end, then take a look at the peoples five hundred years from now. I think you will find but few images of God, unless you want to profane the Almighty.\n -Adolf Hitler (Mein Kampf)\n\n \n You are very good at taking passages out of context. Hitler was a politician and he was mad. In private he states what he meant, and in public, he made a truce with the Soviet Union, the same people he would order to be exterminated as sub-humans. You've produced some of his pronouncements about what he'd want people to believe, but nothing to connect his actions to Jesus' teachings.\n \n How it is that you come to trust his proclamations, I'm not sure of. The fact he is mad and made a lot of statements...\n \"The claim is sometimes made that Hitler was a Christian - a Roman Catholic until the day he died. In fact, Hitler rejected Christianity. \n \n The book Hitler's Secret Conversations 1941-1944 published by Farrar, Straus and Young, Inc.first edition, 1953, contains definitive proof of Hitler's real views. The book was published in Britain under the title, _Hitler's Table Talk 1941-1944, which title was used for the Oxford University Press paperback edition in the United States. \n \n All of these are quotes from Adolf Hitler: \n \n Night of 11th-12th July, 1941: \n \n National Socialism and religion cannot exist together.... The heaviest blow that ever struck humanity was the coming of Christianity. Bolshevism is Christianity's illegitimate child. Both are inventions of the Jew. The deliberate lie in the matter of religion was introduced into the world by Christianity.... Let it not be said that Christianity brought man the life of the soul, for that evolution was in the natural order of things. (p 6 & 7) \n \n 10th October, 1941, midday: \n \n Christianity is a rebellion against natural law, a protest against nature. Taken to its logical extreme, Christianity would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure. (p 43) \n \n 14th October, 1941, midday: \n \n The best thing is to let Christianity die a natural death.... When understanding of the universe has become widespread... Christian doctrine will be convicted of absurdity.... Christianity has reached the peak of absurdity.... And that's why someday its structure will collapse.... ...the only way to get rid of Christianity is to allow it to die little by little.... Christianity the liar.... We'll see to it that the Churches cannot spread abroad teachings in conflict with the interests of the State. (p 49-52) \n \n 19th October, 1941, night: \n \n The reason why the ancient world was so pure, light and serene was that it knew nothing of the two great scourges: the pox and Christianity. \n \n 21st October, 1941, midday: \n \n Originally, Christianity was merely an incarnation of Bolshevism, the destroyer.... The decisive falsification of Jesus' doctrine was the work of St.Paul. He gave himself to this work... for the purposes of personal exploitation.... Didn't the world see, carried on right into the Middle Ages, the same old system of martyrs, tortures, XXXXXXX? Of old, it was in the name of Christianity. Today, it's in the name of Bolshevism. Yesterday the instigator was Saul: the instigator today, Mardochai. Saul was changed into St.Paul, and Mardochai into Karl Marx. By exterminating this pest, we shall do humanity a service of which our soldiers can have no idea. (p 63-65) \n \n 13th December, 1941, midnight: \n \n Christianity is an invention of sick brains: one could imagine nothing more senseless, nor any more indecent way of turning the idea of the Godhead into a mockery.... .... When all is said, we have no reason to wish that the Italians and Spaniards should free themselves from the drug of Christianity. Let's be the only people who are immunised against the disease. (p 118 & 119) \n \n 14th December, 1941, midday: \n \n Kerrl, with noblest of intentions, wanted to attempt a synthesis between National Socialism and Christianity. I don't believe the thing's possible, and I see the obstacle in Christianity itself.... Pure Christianity-- the Christianity of the catacombs-- is concerned with translating Christian doctrine into facts. It leads quite simply to the annihilation of mankind. It is merely whole-hearted Bolshevism, under a tinsel of metaphysics. (p 119 & 120) \n \n 9th April, 1942, dinner: \n \n There is something very unhealthy about Christianity (p 339) \n \n 27th February, 1942, midday: \n \n It would always be disagreeable for me to go down to posterity as a man who made concessions in this field. I realize that man, in his imperfection, can commit innumerable errors-- but to devote myself deliberately to errors, that is something I cannot do. I shall never come personally to terms with the Christian lie. Our epoch Uin the next 200 yearse will certainly see the end of the disease of Christianity.... My regret will have been that I couldn't... behold .\" (p 278)\"\n http://answers.org/apologetics/hitquote.html\n \n You've yet to bring about a link between Christ's teachings and Hitler's philosophy. But I suggest you also look at\n \"Christianity is an invention of sick brains,\" Adolf Hitler, 13 December 1941.\n \"So it's not opportune to hurl ourselves now into a struggle with the Churches. The best thing is to let Christianity die a natural death,\" Adolf Hitler, 14 October 1941.\n http://kevin.davnet.org/essays/hitler.html\n \n \n This sort of argument makes me realise you're not a practicing Catholic. Catholics, and Orthodox (which I am one) agree on this point, you don't take away from the Bible what you want to! The interpretation of the Bible is not up to the individual to decide, but rather the collective wisdom of our respective churches. You obviously missed that one; it's why Protestants took the exact path you proclaim - individual reading and interpretation/ \n\n \n \nYou would be surprised how progressive the catholic church has become in this. Our priest tells us every Sunday \"Read the bible and take from it what you can\". From a realistic standpoint, this makes quite a bit of sense. The church does not want to see its members carrying out old testament style punishments. Even in the new testament, there are quite a few things that we prefer to gloss over. \n\n \n I'd be highly surprised that a Catholic priest would be teaching a Protestant doctrine. He probably means to be positive about encouraging you to read it, and get what you can from it, NOT interpret it for yourself as opposed to Catholic teaching. I think you misunderstand him.\n \n \nWhat about the Lutherans, who split from the church because of corruption in the church (If I remember correctyl, (sic) the pope was sleeping with 12 yr old prosititutes).\n\n \n What about it? Please put this statement in a context! If you are asking me about the Papacy committing corrupt practices, no one says \"it was okay then, let's forgive it\" Show me the argument where Catholics are using relativist arguments.\n \n \nPls don't try to class yourself in with the Catholics. The Pope has called for tolerance and brotherhood between Muslims and Catholics a half dozen times in the last few years. \n\n \n I am not a Catholic. What I was saying is however, that Orthodox and Catholics share a belief in teachings ex scriptura. We also don't believe in personal interpretation over church teachings.\n \n \nIslam is about submitting to the will of God, just like Christianity. \n\n \n \n If you go to most nations, people are hospitable towards foreigners (except France). If you go to a Muslim nation, and you want to preach Christianity, you are likely to find that hospitality taken away. In the west though, the reverse is not true. You can be arrested in Saudi Arabia, if you have a cross that can be easily seen. \n\n \n \nI have done quite a bit of travelling, including to the middle east, and they are as tolerate and hospitable to foreigners as anywhere. The most inhospitable country on the planet to foreigners is probably Japan, where they smale (sic) while they call you a monkey. \n\n \n Needless to say, unlike Islamic states, even Japan doesn't outlaw preachers.\n \n \nYes, if you go to the ME planning to convert people, you are likely to meet with no small amount of unpleasantness. Luckily, most Muslims don;t klive (sic) in the Middle East.\n\n \n Yes most don't, but where Sharia law exists, they persecute preachers.\n \n \nShow me the Orthodox teaching that says what you think it says. \n\n \n \nI know very little of \"orthodox\" teachings. I am familiar with the Catholic and Luthran (sic) version of things (my fatehr (sic) was a Luthran (sic)). Most \"orthodox\" Christians I have met have been totalitarin (sic) jerks, with the exception of some Greek Orthodox.\n\n \n Oddly enough you've been arguing not to judge Muhammad's faith on the basis of a few Mohammedans. If I'd made this statement you'd have accused me of being hateful etc. No further comment.\n \n \n So there is no evil? You don't think sleeping with a child is evil? \n\n \n \nOf course there is evil, and by today's standards, sleeping with a child is an evil act. By the standards of the time, and standards of some modern nations, childhood stops at about 7 or 8.\n\n \n Not even Muslims make this claim. For them, childhood for a girl stops at menses. It is not arbitrary age like '9'. Further, I must repeat again that not even a Muslim would argue that Muhammad's morals were relative to his time. They would argue that what good he did was good for all time.\n \n \n Did the Jews kill Jesus? I thought the Romans did. Obviously you're reading a different Bible. Show me the Bible passage you're thinking of. \n\n \n \nHmmm, I was sure that it was the priests that took Jesus to pilot to be tried, and there was that whole thing about pilot washing his hands of the whole mess.....\n\n \n You mean Pilate? He was a Roman, not a Jew. The fact that the Jews took Him there is indicative about who ran the state. In religious affairs, the Jews were allowed to administer to their own, but in terms of capital punishment, the Jews had to hand Him over to the government. Unless you can show me the text where the Jews order him to be executed, and then carry it out, you're talking about what you suppose the Bible says, not what it does say.\n \n \n In summary, you claim you're not comparing the two; Jesus and Muhammad - but then you do exactly that. And most shocking of all, when the Bible says one thing happened, your supposition is that something else might have happened! You make sweeping statements about Hitler and the KKK in relation to Christianity, offering nothing again but your own misplaced opinion - misplaced because you know full well, that Christ never advocated anything that the Nazis of KKK envisioned. \n\n \n \nNope, still not comparing Jesus and Muhammad.\n\n \n You have. You've said that what Jesus did might have been just as bad as Muhammad, just we've no record of it. So, without any proof, rests your comparison... we know what Muhammad did...\n \n The Banu Qurayzah tribe which had aided him in his early struggles, refused to convert to Islam (recall that Muslims will quote - there's no compulsion in religion'!)\n \n The members of the last surviving Jewish tribe in Medinah, Banu Qurayzah, were even less fortunate. Muhammad offered the men conversion to Islam as an alternative to death; upon their refusal, all 900 were decapitated in front of their enslaved women and children. The women were subsequently raped; Muhammad chose as his concubine one Raihana Bint Amr, whose father and husband were both slaughtered before her eyes only hours earlier.\n http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/C...99Trifkovic.htm\n \n \nAnd I am not supposing that things that are written in the bible did not happen. I am simply applying common sense to the situation and saying that there was obviously a lot of stuff goin (sic) on that wasn't recorded in the bible.\n\n \n There was a lot of stuff 'goin (sic) on'. Again you need to look at Catholic teaching and Orthodox teaching, neither of us teach that we are sola scriptura churches. So, if you find a teaching from Holy Tradition that backs up your notions, please present it.\n \n \nYou claim you are Catholic, but the evidence; by what you argue about how we read the Bible suggest that you're not, or that you missed a major argument. \n\n \n \nYou are wrong. this is a lot of typing. fingers starting to cramp up. Will answer the rest of this utter BS later.\n\n \n It is a central part of Catholicism; teachings based on tradition, not the Bible alone (sola scriptura). If you're going to pretend to be a Catholic, you might as well know what Catholics are meant to believe. It's based on the last passage of John's Gospel, which as I say, we Orthodox also believe in.\n \n In summary, when you offer relativist argument for Muhammad's actions, you make a fundamental error in that Muslims everywhere don't believe his teachings, his example, are only relative, but universal, and for all time. It would help if you understood Islamic teachings as Mohammedans understand them, not as you would wish them to be. Same with the teachings of your own Church, which is of one accord with the Orthodox with regards to where we draw teachings from; \"The Church\", not the Bible alone, nor from individual interpretation. If you don't believe me, run it by your priest.\n \"The Protestant goes directly to the Word of God for instruction, and to the throne of grace in his devotions; whilst the pious Roman Catholic consults the teaching of his church, and prefers to offer his prayers through the medium of the Virgin Mary and the saints.\"\n http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12495a.htm\n \n And your belief that something may have gone on with Jesus, even though you've no proof is quite amazing! I'm wondering why you'd make such a thing up.\n Part 2 of 2 ends",

(We also didn't have militant monastic orders either; a fact that shocked the Byzantines - when monks carrying weapons appeared). That the Pope would feel the need to come to our help, to take back what we once held (before Muslim agrression took it from Christendom) I can understand. The actual 'killing for reward in heaven' bit, I don't.\n \n If you look at the development of Christian theology in the west, they didn't begin to talk about a 'just' war until St. Augustine (that's 400 years after Christ). For Islam, they had it taught right from Muhammed's days. Muhammed even lead by example; ordering raids on commercial caravans, then to pitched battles, then to executing dissenters and PoWs.\n \n Modern apologists for terror, like Daewoo would argue that the oppressive state of Israel breeds people willing to conduct attrocities.

In the early 70's, there was a lot of bad blood between some of the Jordaninas and the Palestenians becasue the number of Palestenain refugees entering Jordan was incredible. They were trashing the job market and were a huge drain on the government of Jordan. So, the fact that the government of Jordan at one time mistreated the Palestenians makes it OK for others to do so? I think not. Two wrongs do not a right make. Of course, jordan didn;t kill off hundreds of thousands of Palestenians, nor did they refuse them citizenship in the end.\n \n \nYes, the USA is like any other super-power - it exapands, often ruthlessly, projecting its power.

I don;t care who the US supports, as long as they are not tyrants. If the US was allinged with the Palestanian Authority, but still carrying out the same acts, I would still speak against them. Some examples of things that are \"wrong\" in my book, regardless of who is doing it.\n \n 1-) murdering tens of thousands of civilians without cause (I believe that under certain circumstances, killing civilians in a democratic nation may be acceptable)\n 2-) treating a group of people as second class citizens based on race, religion, etc....\n 3-)removing the right to self determination (including the right to vote) from people.\n 4-) putting ruthless dictators in power all over the world because they are easier to deal with than a democratically elected government\n 5-) attaching crippling trade agreements to foreign aid packages which demand preferential treatment for foreign countries including exemption from minimum wage requirements and workplace safety programs\n \n Why don't I care whether they get their land back from jordan or not? Palestenians in Jordan are Jordanians for one thing. Tehy have all the rights and privelages of an Jordanian. \n \n I don't particulalrly care if they get theri land back from israel or not, as long as they are all granted citizenship and given the rights that come with it. \n \n \nYou not only apply your rule of justification in a highly biased way, you also do so in every opportunity to be anti-Christian about it.

In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was His fight for the world against the Jewish poison. To-day, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before in the fact that it was for this that He had to shed His blood upon the Cross. As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice.... And if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting rightly it is the distress that daily grows. For as a Christian I have also a duty to my own people.... When I go out in the morning and see these men standing in their queues and look into their pinched faces, then I believe I would be no Christian, but a very devil if I felt no pity for them, if I did not, as did our Lord two thousand years ago, turn against those by whom to-day this poor people is plundered and exploited. \n -Adolf Hitler, in his speech on 12 April 1922 \n \n \n The Government, being resolved to undertake the political and moral purification of our public life, are creating and securing the conditions necessary for a really profound revival of religious life.... The National Government regard the two Christian Confessions as the weightiest factors for the maintenance of our nationality. They will respect the agreements concluded between them and the federal States. Their rights are not to be infringed.... It will be the Government's care to maintain honest co-operation between Church and State; the struggle against materialistic views and for a real national community is just as much in the interest of the German nation as in that of the welfare of our Christian faith. The Government of the Reich, who regard Christianity as the unshakable foundation of the morals and moral code of the nation, attach the greatest value to friendly relations with the Holy See and are endeavouring to develop them. \n -Adolf Hitler, in his speech to the Reichstag on 23 March 1933 \n \n It would have been more to the point, more honest and more Christian, in past decades not to support those who intentionally destroyed healthy life than to rebel against those who have no other wish than to avoid disease. Moreover, a policy of laissez faire in this sphere is not only cruelty to the individual guiltless victims but also to the nation as a whole.... If the Churches were to declare themselves ready to take over the treatment and care of those suffering from hereditary diseases, we should be quite ready to refrain from sterilizing them. \n -Adolf Hitler, in his speech on 30 Jan. 1934 \n \n No, it is not we that have deserted Christianity, it is those who came before us who deserted Christianity. We have only carried through a clear division between politics which have to do with terrestrial things, and religion, which must concern itself with the celestial sphere. There has been no interference with the doctrine (Lehre ) of the Confessions or with their religious freedom (Bekenntnisfreiheit ), nor will there be any such interference. On the contrary the State protects religion, though always on the one condition that religion will not be used as a cover for political ends.... \n National Socialism neither opposes the Church nor is it anti-religious, but on the contrary it stands on the ground of a real Christianity.... For their interests cannot fail to coincide with ours alike in our fight against the symptoms of degeneracy in the world of to-day, in our fight against a Bolshevist culture, against atheistic movement, against criminality, and in our struggle for a consciousness of a community in our national life... These are not anti-Christian, these are Christian principles! And I believe that if we should fail to follow these principles then we should to be able to point to our successes, for the result of our political battle is surely not unblest by God. \n -Adolf Hitler, in his speech at Koblenz, to the Germans of the Saar, 26 Aug. 1934 \n \n If positive Christianity means love of one's neighbour, i.e. the tending of the sick, the clothing of the poor, the feeding of the hungry, the giving of drink to those who are thirsty, then it is we who are the more positive Christians. For in these spheres the community of the people of National Socialist Germany has accomplished a prodigious work. \n -Adolf Hitler, in his speech to the \"Old Guard\" at Munich on 24 Feb. 1939",

How did God communicate His wishes to Hitler? \n\n \n \nBut Christians still follow the old testament as well. You can't disown them just because they portray something that you don't like to have supported.\n\n \n Christians follow Christ's teachings. Christ changed much Old Testament teaching, thus:\n Mat 5:43 \"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbour* and hate your enemy.' \n 44 But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,\n 45 that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.\n 46 If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that?\n 47 And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that?\n 48 Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.\n \n *He is referring to Lev. 19:18\n \n So Jesus is suggesting we have unconditional love. He is taking an OT passage and changing the emphasis to be far-reaching.\n \n \n On a technical note, I don't believe Sodom and Gomorrah are examples of 'genocide', as I'm unaware that these cities consisted the entirety of a race. \n\n \n \nGenocide doesn't have to be about 'race' as such, it is the purging of, to quote dictionary.com, a national, racial, political, or ethnic group. Therefore S&G very much counts.\n\n \n Only if they comprised a complete 'group' based on nation, race, political, or ethnic divisions. They may have comprised of a sub-set of such a group, maybe not. You assume that they do when you apply the term 'genocide' to it. I make no such assumption.\n \n \n So does incidentally, the mass genocide of millions in the Flood; the killings on mass of innocent children in Exodus; his vow to destroy the Amalekites from 'generation to generation'; the anger that Moses' army took prisoners from the Midianites and not slaughtered all the women and children (soon corrected however); his command to the Isralites to kill all the Amalekites \"both man and woman, infant and suckling.\"; his instructions to massacre everyone in the city in Joshua 6; the systematic extermination of the Canaanites; the destruction of the entire nation of the Philistines. The slaughter of Rabbah, Edom, Elan, Merathaim, the Babylonians (He was quite busy in Jeremiah), the slaughter of all the Samaritan's children, his boasting of the destruction of the Amorites. I'm sure I've missed some but does it really matter? I mean when you've got the butchery of untold billions on your hands who really cares about the slaughter of the odd race of three?\n\n \n Another technical point, I don't think we're dealing with 'billions'. Further to that, are you trying to make a point? What is the connection you are drawing here? Are you saying that Hitler received a special instruction from God to commit genocide?\n \n \nOf course those are only examples of his genocidal acts, I've left out all his acts of mere mass murder.\n\n \n Ditto, show me the Hitler revelations.\n \n Further, you need to separate the acts into what is exceptional, what is exemplary and so forth. For instance, David, lusting after the wife of one of his general's ordered that Hittite man to the front of the next attack, so he'd die, paving the way for David to get it on with the widow. There is no where in the Bible that says David was doing something right. He did it, and it's recorded, and he regretted it, and that's recorded too!\n \n Same with Lot sleeping with his daughters. It's not saying 'this is the way people should act'.\n \n So, which instances do you think are exemplary?\n \n \nBelieve me, in NO WAY was I trying to link Hitler with Christ's teachings. Unlike the Old Testament, the New Testament doesn't talk about the systematic destruction of people. In fact, Jesus teaches us to \"love thine enemy as you love thyself.\" This is hardly a basis for Nazi Germany and Hitler's maniacal acts.\n\n \n I agree.\n \n This thread is about Islam and its similarities to Nazism. And there are plenty.\n \n Although one based their ideas on religion, the other on race, they both persecuted groups. Both required minorities to wear special clothing, and to be subject of special laws; including that in both systems, the testimony in court of a person from a minority was unaccepted.\n \n \nI don't quite see how you can say that. Christians follow the word of God, the word of God is written in the Bible, the OT is a part of the Bible. Therefore they follow it.\n\n \n Don't presume to speak for all Christians. Orthodox Christians, and Catholics too (the two biggest denominations) believe that God's word is not limited to the Bible, but the fullness of His teaching is contained in Holy Tradition; and it is this context that we read and interpret the Bible.\n \n What we follow is not all of the Old Testament with the New Testament tacked on.",

In fact, Catholic sermons are all based on the Gospels of Mathew, Mark, Luke and John, which were all disciples of Christ in the New Testament.\n The paradox comes when you try to determine who are God's chosen people today, the Jews who don't belive Christ has come or the Christians who believe he has?\n In my example of Sodom and Gomorrah, God destroyed the cities through his angels , not through the Jews.",

For instance, David, lusting after the wife of one of his general's ordered that Hittite man to the front of the next attack, so he'd die, paving the way for David to get it on with the widow.

It's not saying 'this is the way people should act'. \n\n \n \nI disagree with Lot, it is never condemned in the Bible. In fact it appears to praise the daughters as doing the right thing.\n\n \n That is your interpretation. \n \n Here is the text...\n \n Genesis 19\n Lot and His Daughters \n 30 Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave. 31 One day the older daughter said to the younger, \"Our father is old, and there is no man around here to lie with us, as is the custom all over the earth. 32 Let's get our father to drink wine and then lie with him and preserve our family line through our father.\" \n 33 That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and lay with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. \n 34 The next day the older daughter said to the younger, \"Last night I lay with my father. Let's get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and lie with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.\" 35 So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went and lay with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. \n 36 So both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father. 37 The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab [7] ; he is the father of the Moabites of today. 38 The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi [8] ; he is the father of the Ammonites of today.\n \n I read in this no adulation of their behaviour, in fact, the fact that they had to get their father drunk would suggest that the act was done sneakily.. it says 'he was not aware...'\n \n \nAlthough one based their ideas on religion, the other on race, they both persecuted groups. Both required minorities to wear special clothing, and to be subject of special laws; including that in both systems, the testimony in court of a person from a minority was unaccepted. \n\n \n \nIn the end, Nazism has just become the catch all evil analogy. It certainly appears that way the number of times it is banded about on this forum. I think any comparison is part of the ever present demonization of the IFs. Not actually looking at why they do what they do but just claiming it is because they are 'evil'.\n\n \n Indeed many Nazis came from Christian backgrounds, but saying you're a Christian, and doing the exact opposite of what Christ taught, would lead me to suspect that, they weren't Christian anymore\n \n \n Don't presume to speak for all Christians. Orthodox Christians, and Catholics too (the two biggest denominations) believe that God's word is not limited to the Bible, but the fullness of His teaching is contained in Holy Tradition; and it is this context that we read and interpret the Bible. \n\n \n \nI do not presume to speak for anyone but myself. Following more than the bible does not, however, mean that they don't follow the Bible as well. So the point is moot.\n\n \n Not at all, because we Orthodox believe that the Bible can only be read AND understood in the context of the Church that compiled it; the Orthodox Church! It's like taking a single verse out of the Bible and building a faith around it; this is something we would think was wrong... such as this story that appeared today...\n \"Cult organ donations under investigation\" (http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200407/s1147628.htm) about a group who's \"...website quotes the Apostle Paul, writing a letter to the Romans which 'urged them to present their bodies as living sacrifices'.\"\n \n Thus, rather than interpret this verse for myself, I look to what the Holy Fathers said, and take into account their wisdom.\n \n \n \nWhat we follow is not all of the Old Testament with the New Testament tacked on. \n\n \n \nWell how can I argue? You are a Christian I am not. Therefore it would seem that in any 'your word vs mine' on such a subject I am automatically un-qualified. All I can say is that while I am not a Christian I was raised C of E, and I can't ever remember a priest saying 'read your Bible... but not all of it because there are some bits about God in there that are lies. But it's all still 100% accurate y'know.'\n\n \n Not at all. I am very poor on the Old Testament. In the last year of church, I don't recall a single OT passage being read out at Divine Liturgy. We are a NT Church. My poor knowledge of the OT prevents me from arguing for the most part past the fact that I have faith in the Church and that they are not wrong - even when I don't understand things myself.\n However, I did do Medieval History and know that the idea that the God of the Old Testament and the God of the New Testament were, to some people so inherrently different that they believed in fact that there were two distinct gods! They are commonly called 'dualists', but specific groups include the Bogomils, the Manicheans, and (probably mispelled) the Albegensians.\n \n Here though, are an assortment of answers I'll throw at you...\n \"How can we then reconcile God's apparent anger and harshness in the Old Testament and Jesus' Gentleness in the New Testament?\n \n I think an answer might be in the types of people that He was dealing with at the time. During ancient times in the Old Testament, about the only thing that got people's attention was raw power. The most powerful warrior would conquer territories and become King. When a more powerful person came along, that King was killed and the new person became King. Authority was almost synonymous with power.\n \n Given such a prevailing attitude, it makes sense that God didn't actually change. He simply presented a different view of Himself. He presented a spectacular Creation in Genesis, and He regularly \"smote\" whole armies in an instant to permit victory for His favored Tribes.\n \n Consider a human father who finds the need to reprimand a young child. He might easily attempt to seem extremely harsh and powerful, in order to get necessary lessons across.\n \n By the time that Jesus Walked on Earth, men's attitudes had advanced (a little). Jesus consistently demonstrated and taught Love and Generosity and Gentleness. We then had first-hand experience of the wonderful Lovingkindness of God. That Lovingkindness had always been there, even in the apparently harsh Old Testament God. But, during Old Testament times, such Gentleness would have been perceived as weakness, and God knew that. Therefore, even though He Loved His followers very much, it was not appropriate for Him to show it.\"\n http://mb-soft.com/public/godotnt.html\n \n \"There are those who say that the God of the Old Testament was a God of judgment and vindictiveness, both on Israel, as well as the nations, whereas the God of the New Testament is a God of love and grace. This dichotomy is not true, for God is the same in both Testaments. God was loving and gracious to His people Israel in the Old Testament. Granted, He was judgmental of the other nations. He had good reason to be, as they were idolaters, and trafficked in sexual perversion as worship to their heathen idols. That is why God told Israel to drive them out of the land, or kill them off, and certainly not intermarry with them.\n \n God's judgment on Israel came because they did not follow His ways, and when they repented and turned from their wicked ways, He graciously forgave them, and restored them both to the land as well as in His favor. The problem lay in the inability of Israel to keep the covenant they had agreed to with God at Mt. Sinai. God kept His part of the bargain, and the law itself was holy, just, and good. But, it was Israel who failed to live up to what they had agreed. See: Exod. 19-32 and Matt. 5:17.\"\n http://www.leaderu.com/offices/stoll/godlove.html\n \n I couldn't find an Orthodox source on this (not yet, anyway).\n \n PS we seem to be moving away from a critque of Islam to a critique of Christianity.",
