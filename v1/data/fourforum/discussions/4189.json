   "Here are some examples of powerful anti-Christian trends in our culture.\n \n **George Carlin's \"seven holy words\" that cannot be broadcast on television are: \"God,\" \"Jesus,\" \"Christ,\" \"bless,\" \"heaven,\" \"salvation,\" and \"soul.\"\n \n **George Bush I said that Christians should not be considered patriots or real American citizens. \n \n **Bill Clinton and George Bush II refuse to give any speeches at churches. \n \n ** On Sunday mornings, nearly all major television and radio channels broadcast pro-atheist shows; it is nearly impossible to find religious programming during that time period. Further, Madalyn Murray O'Hair has her own rebroadcast cable TV channels, and stations. Pat Robertson and Falwell et al have been unable to obtain media time. \n \n **Most major newspapers run a weekly section devoted to atheism. There are no equivalent sections for religious news.\n \n **Anti-Christian shows such as the American Atheist Forum are broadcast by major national networks. Billy Graham is only able to get on the air through public access TV, which is watched by few people. \n \n **Nobody is ever shown giving thanks to God after surviving a disaster. \n \n **It is almost impossible to find a shopping mall with a Christian Armory book store, while Atheist Book Centers are on every corner. \n \n **Churches are extremely rare and it is nearly impossible for Christian couples to find a church where they can marry. \n Atheist meeting centers can be found every few blocks. \n \n **All of our elected public officials are atheists; they swear on a copy of Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" in order to take office. \n \n ** Christians often find it nearly impossible to get time off work for religious holidays such as Christmas. \n \n **Radical anti-Christian bias pervades our society. When somebody sneezes, most people say \"Darwin bless you\". Similarly, \"Voltaire dammit!\" is a common cussword. \n \n **Our money has the atheistic slogan \"We do not trust in God\" printed on it. \n \n **In school, our children are made to recite the pledge, \"One nation, anti-God, ...\"\n \n **Athiest Organizations such as the Boy Scouts deny membership to Christians and heterosexuals. \n \n **Christian churches are forced to pay exorbitant taxes. \n \n **Darwin fish dominate the Fish Wars and \"Jesus Was A Jerk\" is a common bumper sticker.\n \n **Pedestrians are virtually forced to receive Betrand Russell's tract \"Why I Am Not A Christian\". \n \n **Christians are afraid to admit their Christianity to parents and friends, for fear their kin will consider them immoral Christian scum and want nothing to do with them. \n \n **At baseball games, you can often spot people carrying signs that read \"Origin Of Species, page 34\".\n \n **86% of Americans do not believe in God. \n \n **Politicians often refer to America's \"Agnosto-Atheist heritage\" when trying to woo voters. \n \n **Jurors must take an oath upon a copy of the Skeptical Inquirer before they can serve. There have even been court cases thrown out because one of the jury members was a Christian who insisted on swearing on a Bible. \n \n **People are free to wear pentagram jewelry, but those trying to wear cross-shaped earrings or pendants to work will be politely told to remove the jewelry or lose their job. \n \n **Every hotel room has a copy of Nietzsche's The Anti-Christ in the room.\n \n \"There are no Christians in foxholes\" is a popular slogan in our society.\n \n **Most hospitals are full of atheist symbols, and many prominently feature statues of Nietszche, Darwin, and so forth. \n \n **Communities set up atheist brainwashing facilities, and apply l pressure to citizens to attend every Sunday morning. Furthermore, attendees are expected to contribute money to support these facilities, and to build others in other countries. \n \n **Most parents in America indoctrinate their children at an early age to be atheists by forcing them to attend these brainwashing sessions, whether they want to or not. \n \n **Atheists are beginning to subvert the American political process. For example, the American Atheists recently published millions of voter's guides for distribution at atheist meeting-houses. These guides gave specific instructions note to vote for those who oppose atheist values. \n \n **Atheists regularly go door-to-door on Sunday mornings asking people not to go to church.\n \n **Atheists have often invented \"deathbed deconversion\" stories about famous Christians, claiming they became atheists just before they died. \n \n **Despite the overwhelming number of Atheists in the general population and in powerful legislative positions, when they don't get their own way, Atheists whine that this is an anti-Atheistic country. \n \n **Around the time of Darwin's birth Christians have to putup with songs about Darwin, which are played in shopping malls, restaurants, and even public restrooms.\n \n **We number our calendar years according to the number of years that have passed since Darwin's brithday. (Hence the term \"A.D\"-- \"After Darwin\".) \n \n **Books which promote Christianity are often removed from library shelves in response to atheist pressure groups. \n \n **A popular bumper sticker reads, \"No Jesus, Know Peace. Know Jesus, No Peace.\" \n \n **Atheists do everything possible to get laws passed that will prevent irrational Christians from making their own choices in matters of sex, procreation, life-styles, family units, etc. \n \n **Atheists from Salt Lake City collect lists of dead people, so that they can be deconverted posthumously into Atheists.\n \n **Atheists offen try to scare Christians into disbelief by yelling that after they die they will be sent to the earth's firey core and tormented by Nietzsche for eternity. \n \n **All prisons have a resident atheist philosopher, and inmates are encouraged to participate in weekly philophical dicussions on Bible Contradictions. This is often reported to parole board, who consider it a good indication of contritness on the prisoner's part. \n \n **A political candidate who declares himself a Christian will NOT have a chance of winning an election. \n \n Please note that I simply cut and pasted from this link. And I believe the author of that post cut and pasted from somewhere else. If nothing else, it provides some food for thought. Have fun!\n \n Peace,\n The Bootfitter",

It's tongue-in-cheek humor with a lot of truth hidden in it.\n \n It is a good indication how Christianity permeates our society, and how the non-theist is expected to simply put up with it. When a small change is agitated for, such as removing the ten commandments from a public building, one can see the sheer size of the opposition arrayed against such an endeavor.\n \n I have many times since losing my faith wished to bury the whole subject and simply live my life without another thought of the subject.

   "Hi Bill, I had knee surgery two days ago, so now I have some time to sit at the computer and be a REAL pain in the arse to you guys :) I can truly see why you get your panties in a knot about the whole thing tho. But would you not agree that our society today , is less religiously oppressive , than say , like it was in the sixties ??\n\n \n Well, from my point of view, it is both less religiously oppressive in some respects, and more in others. The government mandates (reversing under the current adminstration) is much more hands off of religion, and more respectful about people using government powers to force religious views on others (again, reversing under the current admin).\n \n On the other hand, you have some religious extremists that are more politically aware, understand the manipulation of the media better, and much more willing to push their viewpoints on the rest of the world. Judge Moore and that yo-yo who is embrodering his robe with the 10 commandments \n are two minor players in that. The Christian Identy movement would be scary if they were competant.",
