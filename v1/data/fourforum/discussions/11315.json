The fact that everyone including those who created the treaty have admitted it is a constitution by the back door is apparently irrelevant.\n \n (Whereabouts in Europe do you hail from ? On the far Eastern edges ?)\n \n The EC do themselves no favour by all the duplicity they get up to.",

   "To Ireland where referendum on this treaty was wrecked Great Britain has joined by stopping of the ratification. \n\n \n Incorrect. Gordon Brown has pushed through ratification despite mass popular displeasure. At the moment the EU is putting pressure on Eastern European countries to ensure they don't reject it as well.\n \n \nThe fact is that Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is now busy considering the complaint of the Conservative Party sponsor Stuart Wheeler. The businessman is dissatisfied with the fact that the government has refused to make Treaty of Lisbon subject to debate in referendum.\n \n \n As peter said, there is no Supreme Court in the UK. Petitions have been launched, and the Conservatives have promised a referendum on the treaty, though whether that will make any difference is a matter of conjecture. As far as I'm aware, there is no actual court action. If we tried to take politicians to court every time they broke an election promise, we'd never get out of the courts....\n \n \nTo tell the truth it looks like a well-planed action by evil forces!\n \n \n Michael Howard wasn't involved!\n \n \nThe fact is that USA with all its might is trying to avert EU consolidation. And they are successful with this imo!\n \n \n America is too worried by China to get het up over the EU. Anyway, enough of us over here aren't happy with the increasing fedralization of Europe so we're kinda pleased that this constitution has bit the dust...\n \n \nHere in Europe we can't solve some urgent problems. \n\n \n And we'll be able to do even less by destroying basic democracy....\n \n \nWe have to shelf them due to American will. For how long are we going to let those wily American Fox rule Europe?\n\n \n I don't think the Americans do rule Europe. I must admit that I wouldn't be sad to see America's world influence be reigned in a notch or two, but I'm more worried about already corrupt politicians being given the chance to leech of the entire of Europe....",
