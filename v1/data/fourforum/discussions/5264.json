   "Newsweek in their haste to go after the Bush administration blows it again on only this time 15 people die for their liberal bias.........\n \n http://apnews.excite.com/article/20050516/D8A41L4G0.html\n \n \n Newsweek Apologizes for Quran Story Errors\n Email this Story\n \n May 15, 11:59 PM (ET)\n \n By DINO HAZELL\n \n \n NEW YORK (AP) - Newsweek magazine has apologized for errors in a story alleging that interrogators at the U.S. detention center in Guantanamo Bay desecrated the Quran, saying it would re-examine the accusations, which sparked outrage and deadly protests in Afghanistan.\n \n Fifteen people died and scores were injured in violence between protesters and security forces, prompting U.S. promises to investigate the allegations. After Muslim leaders in several countries assailed the U.S. over the allegations, Pentagon officials blamed Newsweek for the flare-up and accused it of \"irresponsible\" reporting.\n \n \"We regret that we got any part of our story wrong, and extend our sympathies to victims of the violence and to the U.S. soldiers caught in its midst,\" Newsweek Editor Mark Whitaker wrote in a note to readers.\n \n In an issue dated May 9, the magazine reported that U.S. military investigators had found evidence that interrogators placed copies of Islam's holy book in washrooms and had flushed one down the toilet to get inmates to talk.\n \n Whitaker wrote that the magazine's information came from \"a knowledgeable U.S. government source,\" and before it published the item, writers Michael Isikoff and John Barry sought comment from two Defense Department officials. One declined to respond, and the other challenged another part of the story but did not dispute the Quran charge, Whitaker said.\n \n But on Friday, a top Pentagon spokesman told the magazine that a review of the military's investigation concluded \"it was never meant to look into charges of Quran desecration. The spokesman also said the Pentagon had investigated other desecration charges by detainees and found them 'not credible.'\"\n \n Whitaker added that the magazine's original source later said he could not be sure he read about the alleged Quran incident in the report Newsweek cited, and that it might have been in another document.\n \n \"Top administration officials have promised to continue looking into the charges, and so will we,\" Whitaker wrote.\n \n Newsweek Washington Bureau Chief Daniel Klaidman said the magazine believes it erred in reporting the allegation that a prison guard tried to flush the Quran down a toilet and that military investigators had confirmed the accusation.\n \n \"The issue here is to get the truth out, to acknowledge as quickly as possible what happened, and that's what we're trying to do,\" Klaidman told the \"CBS Evening News\" on Sunday.\n \n Many of the 520 inmates at Guantanamo are Muslims arrested during the U.S.-led war against the Taliban and its al-Qaida allies in Afghanistan.\n \n Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said in a statement that the original story was \"demonstrably false\" and \"irresponsible,\" and \"had significant consequences that reverberated throughout Muslim communities around the world.\"\n \n \"Newsweek hid behind anonymous sources, which by their own admission do not withstand scrutiny,\" Whitman said. \"Unfortunately, they cannot retract the damage they have done to this nation or those that were viciously attacked by those false allegations.\"\n \n After Newsweek published the story, demonstrations spread across Afghanistan and Muslims around the world decried the alleged desecration.\n \n In Afghanistan, Islamic scholars and tribal elders called for the punishment of anyone found to have abused the Quran, said Maulawi Abdul Wali Arshad, head of the religious affairs department in Badakhshan province.\n \n Arshad and the provincial police chief said the scholars met in Faizabad, 310 miles northeast of the capital, Kabul, and demanded a \"reaction\" from U.S. authorities within three days.\n \n Lebanon's most senior Shiite Muslim cleric on Sunday said the reported desecration of the Quran is part of an American campaign aimed at disrespecting and smearing Islam.\n \n In a statement faxed to The Associated Press, Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah called the alleged desecration a \"brutal\" form of torture and urged Muslims and international human rights organizations \"to raise their voices loudly against the American behavior.\"\n \n On Saturday, Pakistan's President Gen. Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, both allies of Washington, demanded an investigation and punishment for those behind the reported desecration of the Quran.\n \n The story also sparked protests in Pakistan, Yemen and the Gaza Strip. The 22-nation Arab League issued a statement saying if the allegations panned out, Washington should apologize to Muslims.\n \n National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley said in an interview for CNN's \"Late Edition\" that the allegations were being investigated \"vigorously.\"",

You're moving closer and closer to a fascist, toliteraian regime with that logic. Newsweek shouldn't have retracted, it's a bad journalism practice. Merely because things happened because you reported what occured doesn't mean that you do a 180. I hardly think that this incident is going to damage our position any more then it already is. The whole \"My god is better then there's\" public attitude represented in a former General is far more damaging this this story not to mention the killings of 20,000 or so Iraqis. \n \n \n\n I don't think there is any revelation that a substantial majority of Americans no longer have any trust in the elite news media.

You now consider such things as reporting what happened as \"bad?\" You're crazier then I give you credit for if you believe that.

You seem to have a real problem with accepting that your country has, does and will do bad things.\n \n Besides, I still want to know how Newsweek has a liberal bias when it failed to report a number of bad bush policies and their consequences as well as glossing over many more. \n \n Interesting how VOR fails to deal with that problem.",

My leftwing friends indeed. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n But after reading the posts above I am going to have to go with Missouri on this one. (Now don't go calling me a facist!!) I think he's on to something here. However, in regard to the person who is responsible for this damaging journalism, I need to know more before coming to such a decisive conclusion as Mr. Mule did. If, the journalist, in fact believed his sources to be true, beyond a reasonable doubt, and can pass a polygraph to that fact, how can we rightously crucify him without doing the same to our president? President Bush, I believe, seriously believed in his cause to go into Iraq (WMD's, remember?) Turns out, well, we all know how that turned out. Let's not be too quick to judge.",

   "huh.\n \n \nNEWSWEEK was not the first to report  allegations of desecrating the Qur'an. As early as last spring and summer, similar reports from released detainees started surfacing in British and Russian news reports, and in the Arab news agency Al-Jazeera; claims by other released detainees have been covered in other media since then. But the NEWSWEEK report arrived at a particularly delicate moment in Afghan politics. Opponents of the Karzai government, including remnants of the deposed Taliban regime, have been looking for ways to exploit public discontent. The Afghan economy is weak, and the government (pressed by the United States) has alienated farmers by trying to eradicate their poppy crops, used to make heroin in the global drug trade. Afghan men are sometimes rounded up during ongoing U.S. military operations, and innocents can sit in jail for months. When they are released, many complain of abuse. President Karzai is still largely respected, but many Afghans regard him as too dependent on and too obsequious to the United States. With Karzai scheduled to come to Washington next week, this is a good time for his enemies to make trouble.\n\n \n http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/10545\n \n Yes, it's a blog I realize that. \n \n Newsweek seems to be trying to cover its butt and you don't blame them. Still, considering what has happened in such places, to declare that such a incident did not occur is just ignorant, that doesn't however, mean it did happen.",

   "There are a few things about the whole damn thing that irk me.\n \n One is the fact that Newsweak would have the audacity to publish utter trash with no apparent fear of being called on it - in the aftermath of the Rathergate affair. Talk about \"freedom of speach\" all you like...there are reasonable limits or lines. That line was most assuredly crossed. The yelling \"FIRE!\" in a crowded theatre for kicks if you will - a bad, but most common, example. Well, this is even worse that that. It wasn't done for \"kicks\" but to purposly publish political kindling...or...to degrade the American military fighting the good fight against terrorism. Either way, it is despicable.\n \n The second thing that stands out to me is the fact that despite Newsweaks retraction and admission, the Islamaniacs will not hear of it --- it's a call to Jihad no matter what the truth is --- this is the mindset we are up against in a war on terrorism. Total ****in' brainwashed fruitloops.\n \n Mental meanderings:\n \n Assuming the Qu'ran, Koran, is roughly the size of a bible...does it really even make any sense that one could be \"flushed down the toilet\"? Was it a \"pocket-size\" version? \n \n Should we Americans get all freeky crazy when we see pics on MSNBC of fruitloops burning American flags? Nah, we know nutters when we see 'em. It's odd, given our often critisised \"overly\" patriotic persona, that we don't up and torch even one Mosque in America! Hell, if we torched one for every nitwitted Mullah/cleric's chant of \"death to America\", we would be equal.
