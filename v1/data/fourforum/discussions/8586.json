   "SUMMARY: A Kansas B&B owner who hoists a Pride flag over his small-town establishment soon learns the true colors of his neighbors. \n \n A bed-and-breakfast owner in Meade, Kansas, has created a tempest with the rainbow Pride flag, a gift from his son, that he hoisted three weeks ago next to the Stars and Stripes over his establishment. \n \n J.R. Knight and his wife, Robin, moved to town two years ago to run the Lakeway Inn, \"midway between the infamous 'Boot Hill' in Dodge City and the fabled 'Land of Oz' in Liberal,\" as their Web site states. \n \n Knight received the rainbow flag from his 12-year-old after a trip to a nearby museum about the Wizard of Oz. The flag reminded the boy of \"somewhere over the rainbow.\" \n \n Knight says he knew the flag stood for gay rights (\"I'm not an idiot\"), but also for a lot of other things, like unity and friendship. \n \n People in the town of 1,600 apparently went ballistic. But Knight dug in his heels. He claims a radio station threatened to pull the Lakeway Inn's ads if he did not remove the flag. Quite a few \"sweet Christian people\" sincerely told him the flag stood for sin. A pastor told him it was as inappropriate as hanging women's panties on a flagpole. Knight joked that he might consider it. \n \n \"I told him, 'How about I go to your church and take down everything about Jesus?' It's the same thing.\" \n \n While the Lakeway Inn has lost local restaurant business over the controversy, Knight says hotel patronage is up. He's on two major highways -- Hwy. 54 east/west and Hwy. 23 north/south -- and has, he says, the only alcohol license for 40 miles. \n \n \"Any gay or lesbian people that do stop by will be treated with the best service I can give you,\" Knight told KWCH-TV reporter Tucker Jankosky of Wichita. \"When this rainbow flag shreds, I will buy another one, and another one, and another one. Just like my American flag, I'll buy another one.\" \n \n He told Gay.com: \"I wasn't flying it in people's face, but anymore I kind of am, because people need to learn.\" \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/po/20060726/co_po/straightkansanloveshisrainbowflag",

   "Knight says the local Meade newspaper is trying to put him out of business and was frustrated when it ran an article about the flag and did not even bother to contact him regarding why he put it up. In fact, most people we spoke to in Meade said they didn't even know what the flag meant until the article ran. But once word got around, the reaction was harsh.\n \n Knight says the radio station has called him threatening to remove the restaurant's commercials if he does not remove the flag. A local pastor stopped by said it was equivalent to hanging women's panties on a flag pole. When Knight jokingly said he might consider that - the preacher said he would have him arrested.\n \n His business has suffered - down to only a few local customers. The folks in Meade who've boycotted say it's too offensive for them to eat there.\n \n Local resident, Keith Klassen says the flag is a slap in the face to the conservative community of Meade. \"To me it's just like running up a Nazi flag in a Jewish neighborhood. I can't walk into that establishment with that flag flying because to me that's saying that I support what the flag stands for and I don't,\" says Klassen.\n \n Knight says it's not meant to be a gay pride symbol but he doesn't mind if that's how it's taken. Any gay or lesbian people that do stop by will be treated with the best service I can give you,\" says Knight.\n http://pandagon.net/2006/07/25/crazies-go-after-kansas-bb-owner-for-flying-rainbow-flag/",

   "Got a link?.\n\n \n http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2006/08/07/1\n A 12-year-old son's gift of a colorful flag he found while staying with his grandparents in California has put his parents in the middle of controversy in the small town of Meade, Kansas. \n J.R. and Robin Knight said they knew the rainbow flag was a symbol of gay rights when they decided last month to fly it on a pole in front of their Lakeway Hotel. \n \n The decision prompted a controversy in the town of 1,600 and eventually someone cut the flag down. It's also prompted an Internet-fueled debate on gay rights in rural America, and the Knights say they have received messages of support from around the world. \n \n The Knights say they are determined to replace the flag and keep it flying. \n \n \"We just put it up. We didn't think about it,\" Robin said. \"It has pretty colors; it's bright' it's summery.\" And, J.R. Knight said, it was a symbolic way to have their son nearby. \n \n Waitress Vicky Best said such a flag has no place in Meade. \n \n \"It's hard enough to keep your kids on the straight and narrow without outside influences like that,\" she complains. \"We stay in a small town to stay away from the XXXX like that that's happening in big cities,\" she said, calling homosexuality \"biblically wrong.\" \n \n But retiree Charles Helms said he doesn't care if the Knights fly the flag. \"If he wants to fly that thing, let him fly it,\" Helms said. \"I don't have a problem at all because I know the story behind it.\" \n \n The Knights say they have no problems with gays but have never taken a role in the gay rights movement. They moved to Meade two years ago from southern California to pursue their dream of operating a bed-and-breakfast. \n \n The Knights say the anger displayed by some residents has strengthened their resolve to keep the rainbow flag flying. Flying the flag not only protests discrimination, they say, but they also believe giving into the pressure would send the wrong message to their son, Anthony. \n \n \"It's our business. It shouldn't be dictated by other people,\" Robin Knight said. So, when someone cut away the flag last week, leaving behind only tattered corners, the Knights quickly ordered two more, and said more will be coming to replace any others that might be destroyed.",

Locals uncomfortable with such a symbol - it also stands for gay pride - decried the flag's presence and then, in the early-morning hours of July 31, someone cut it down.\n \n The disappearance had remained a mystery, but the father of two local boys brought them to the Lakeway on Friday and they owned up to their involvement.\n \n \"They apologized and said they'd replace it,\" J.R. Knight said. He didn't name the boys, and Meade County Sheriff Michael Cox said only that officials are investigating.\n \n Meanwhile, Knight said replacing a 5-foot-by-5-foot plate glass window smashed in at the hotel's restaurant - also apparently due to the flag flap - probably would cost about $500. Two neon beer signs destroyed in the same incident probably will cost another $1,000.\n \n Someone tossed a brick through the window early Friday morning, according to the Knights and local authorities, who are investigating. Scrawled on the brick was the word \"f@g.\"\n",
