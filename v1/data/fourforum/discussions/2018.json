   "IN THE CASE OF\n TRADITION, et., al  v. EQUALITY, et., al\n \n By Christopher Cross\n Citizen of Missouri\n March 1, 2004\n Rodeo1101@netzero.net\n \n In the very near future the people of the State of Missouri will be asked to vote on whether or not marriage should be defined as being between one man and one women. In doing so, we must realize above all else the scope to, which our votes will impact our entire society if we amend our state&#8217;s Bill of Rights. Because of this and moreover, the many aspects involved, we hold a civic duty to examine the question from all sides before rendering our decision.\n \n If we accept that this is a question purely of morals, then we must examine the broad range in, which immorality exists within our society and has existed long before the plight for same-sex marriage surfaced. This is evident by the excessive high rate of divorces, the extent in, which spouses commit adultery, the number of teenage pregnancies, and depth of domestic violence. It is also evident by the totality of dead-beat dads refusing to pay child support, the rate in, which babies are born addicted to drugs and alcohol and the abundant sum of children taken away from their parents because of abuse or neglect. Thus, by the standards of morals, we must ask ourselves whether or not any one of us are truly any better than those whom our legislators are asking us to deprive the same rights and liberties to, which everyone else enjoys. The irony being here is that while we condone rapists, child molesters and murders marrying or having children. Our legislators want us to believe that the plight for gay and lesbian rights to marry is the single most important immorality existing in our State and country that it requires our amending our State and federal Constitutions in order to deny these rights to gay and lesbian individuals. \n \n If we accept that this is solely a question of religious beliefs and practices, then we have no need of a government, for all things in life belong to God and God alone. Yet, God also asks us to obey the laws of man and not trivialize the importance of such. And while many believe that God clearly condemns the behaviors of homosexuality, God also does not want us applying a more vigilant religious approach to one group, while applying a less vigilant approach with other groups. Simply so that one group may own a word, a tradition and control the distribution of rights and liberties. Therefore, while there is certainly a proper place for the many religious beliefs we have in our Country, there is also a proper place for government and moreover, our laws and we must be respectful of each. \n \n If we examine this from a legal point of view then there are several things to consider. The first being Missouri&#8217;s Bill of Rights Article 1, Section 3, which states. 'That the people of this state have the inherent, sole and exclusive right to regulate the internal government and police thereof, and to alter and abolish their constitution and form of government whenever they may deem it necessary to their safety and happiness, [provided] such change be not repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, ' (emphasis brackets added). Therefore, we must then look at both the First and Fourteenth Amendments in the U.S. Constitution, since these amendments govern the freedoms specific to marriage.\n \n The First Amendment guarantees all citizens the inherent right of free speech, religion and association, [provided] one who exercises such does not infringe upon the rights of others to create an [irreparable harm]. If an irreparable harm is created, as would be in cases of polygamy, bigamy, incest and bestiality, which many in opposition use to argue against gays having rights. Then our government, and we, as a society have a right and a duty to discriminate and deny the rights claimed by the person seeking to exercise such. However, when we cannot clearly show that an irreparable harm does in fact exist, which we cannot do in matters of gay and lesbian rights to marry. Then we have no right to deprive others of what everyone else enjoys. Moreover, we must also remember that where the First Amendment gives the freedom of religion, this is to also say that everyone has the inherent right to believe freely in whatever religion or religious practice he/she deems necessary to their spiritual growth and even the lack thereof. And we must be mindful that others may or may not agree with the views of others, but such does not invalidate their beliefs merely because others do not agree.\n \n The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees all citizens equal protection of the law and equal privileges and immunities under the law, just as we hold true in the Missouri Bill of Rights, Article 1, Section 2, which states. 'That all constitutional government is intended to promote the general welfare of the people; that all persons have a natural right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and the enjoyment of the gains of their own industry; that all persons are created equal and are entitled to equal rights and opportunity under the law; that to give security to these things is the principal office of government, and that when government does not confer this security, it fails in its&#8217; chief design'. \n \n Many would claim that to permit same-sex marriage is to invalidate the heterosexual marriage and long standing traditions and this is a view to be respected in due consideration. Yet, while the majority of American citizens are opposed to same-sex marriages, the majority is also opposed to any constitutional amendment that would alter the citizenship of any American by declaring them less in their status. So why then should we, as Missouri citizens be any less protective of our state constitution when the outcome will be the same that will be achieved if we amend our federal constitution? \n \n Some argue that in place of the term 'marriage', gay and lesbian people should be allowed to unite under the term 'civil union'. However, no state passing laws to ban same-sex marriages have, in any way, extended [all] the same rights and liberties afforded to heterosexual marriages, under the concept of 'civil unions'. Therefore, in the governments&#8217; quest to control the distribution of rights, same-sex couples have essentially been denounced by the government as being whole American citizens, by virtue of the governments&#8217; refusal to grant them equal rights under any other term. And President Bush illustrated this very point when, in response to the San Francisco same-sex marriages, President Bush ordered the Social Security Administration to no longer accept heterosexual or same-sex marriage licenses as legal documents for identification purposes. It was a calculated effort to pit citizen against citizen, by implementing a [group] punishment for gays asserting their equal rights under the State and federal constitutions. This is also illustrated in the January 2004 Missouri House Bill 885 that seeks to amend the Missouri Human Rights Act, by depriving public and private businesses receiving state funding, of such if these business seek to implement any kind of anti-discrimination policies internally so as to afford gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people anti-discrimination rights. \n \n If we look at this from a scientific viewpoint, then according to Blanchard, R., & Klassen, P. (1997), 'H-Y antigen and homosexuality in men'. Journal of Theoretical Biology, Pp.185, 373-378. 'In men, sexual orientation correlates with the number of older brothers, each additional older brother increasing the odds of homosexuality by approximately 33%. It is hypothesized that this fraternal birth order effect reflects the progressive immunization of some mothers to Y-linked minor histocompatibility antigens (H-Y antigen) by each succeeding male fetus, and the concomitantly increasing effects of H-Y antibodies on the sexual differentiation of the brain in each succeeding male fetus. This hypothesis is consistent with a variety of evidence, including the apparent irrelevance of older sisters to the sexual orientation of later-born males, the probable involvement of H-Y antigen in the development of sex-typical traits, and the detrimental effects of immunization of female mice to H-Y antigen on the reproductive performance of subsequent male offspring'. Therefore, if we accept this theory as true, which we have no cause at the present time not to accept the validity of such. Homosexuality is in-born and thus, not a choice as many opponents argue unto which raises the logical question of whether or not it is correct to deprive a selected group of people of their inherent rights for something they have no control over in their genetic makeup. Whatever the biological cause may be. The scientific community considers the argument that homosexuality derives from individual choice, to be a dead issue, much in the same way that scientists consider one&#8217;s handedness to be genetic. Rather than a personal choice to be either right or left handed, even though they have not found the specific gene involved. \n \n In a short time the citizens of Missouri will be asked to amend our state Constitution's Bill of Rights and in this electoral process release our government officials of their principal office and chief design. We will be asked to undermine the sanctity and necessity of our laws in the process of denouncing a particular group of people as whole American citizens. By depriving them of 'equal protection of the laws and equal rights under the laws' and our State's Bill of Rights. We will be asked to do these very things in the absence of having any alternative name, e.g. civil union, and in this process, we will intentionally discriminate against gay and lesbian people. Yet, while 'civil unions' are a segregation unto itself, State governments afford no middle ground of compromise for us to consider so as to avoid discriminating in the broadest sense because this is not about compromise. It is rather about a subjective claimed right to own a word, a tradition and control the distribution of rights in the case of Tradition v. Equality&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;",
