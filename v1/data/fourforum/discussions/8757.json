   "FDA OKs nonprescription 'morning-after' pill \n Decision allows over-the-counter sale of Plan B for those 18 or older\n \n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14497678/?GT1=8404\n \n What is so funny is that last night (while looking for a condom), I found a spare pack of the morning after-pill and I was sooo excited! I ran out screaming \"I've got Plan-B and I didn't even know it!\". This of course I obtained from Planned Parenthood (the greatest place on earth). My point is, Plan-B is a life saver for a lot of women (young or old) out there who do fall victim to \"the heat of the moment\". It is nice to know that if we do make a mistake that we have a plan B and don't have to worry about going to the doctor, abortions, having a child etc. I should know, I just had an abortion...it is a painful experience I never want to go through again. Besides, when a young girl can go into planned parenthood and under government funding (thank god) get a years worth of birth control for FREE, who is going to be buying Plan B all the time at 25-40 bucks a pack! c'mon people get real. People are going to have sex, we are going to f*ck...IT IS WHAT WE DO! IT'S NATURAL AND A HELL OF A LOT OF FUN. I'm glad people are finally coming to their senses about this issue. I'M SO HAPPY : )",

Even in the debate on federal funding, the govt. is not trying to eliminate sex ed funding--they are trying to make sure abstinence is part of the equation.\n\n Teen sex is an already established part of most teenage cultures nowadays. Given all of the admiration for sexually alluring people shown in the movies and the general media, not to mention the pleasure of sex (for those who don't do it badly) and the hormonal influence on the mind, it is not at all surprising that sex is something that appeals to most teenagers. One has to have convincing arguements to change that culture. Though it is obviously the most effective method, abstinence is very unappealing to teenagers who are used to accepting sex as part of their culture. For most older teenagers, being a virgin is not something that is considered \"cool\". However, the fear of STDs (including AIDs) and pregnancy can be and is being used as a somewhat successful method for at least making teens more responsible about their sexual acts. Free distributions of condoms could certainly help in this effort. Unfortunately, it is mainly those on the far right who obstruct full efforts at making teens more responsible in their actions (including obstructing such free condom distributions) since they view teen sex as wrong to begin with. So, the far right's stance favoring abstinence is simply not convincing while many seem to view a full agressive effort at educating responsible sex (condoms, etc.) as condoning teenage sex and therefore restrict it. This does not lead to sufficiently effective results.\n \n I agree that, given the immaturity of most teenagers, abstinence would be the preferable thing. However, changing teenage culture is a hard sell. One would have to sell virginity as something that \"cool\" teenagers engage in. In some areas of the country (mainly socially conservative areas), efforts have been made in this direction in the media and have led to some success. I just don't see a reasonable way for that to happen in the country as a whole. I'm curious, jyoshu, do you know what methods are being used in the more conservative areas of the country to try to make virginity seem socially acceptable to teenagers?",

They compare themselves to adults in their rights and expectations. If they live in a society where everyone (from the young hip twenty-somethings to the elderly) views morality based on religious teachings as something to be highly prized and where the common answer to \"Why do we need to do ...\" is \"Because God or the Bible tells us so...\", then many of such teenagers in that society may also view the Bible as the ultimate authority.

For example, when parents tell teenagers that they should not take drugs despite the fact that they had taken drugs as teenagers, that seems to them like arbitrary use of power.

Though I can't say for sure, I suspect your view on that is not based on religious teachings. My point is that it doesn't require religion to come to the understanding that abstinence before a commitment of love to someone (marriage) is the better way. It seems there are lots of people out there (not necessarily religious) who will say, as you have, 'yeah, I know it's best' but because of the pervasiveness of NON-premarital abstinence, they don't think it should be a priority. That just doesn't seem like sound reasoning to me. If it's the preferable thing, then we should strive toward it regardless of how hard it might be. It's that simple.\n \n It may be true that it's easier to convince people of the value of abstinence in more 'religious' geographic areas, but IMO that's beside the point. Giving up promiscuity is a a good thing regardless of religion. And that's really the bottom line of abstinence. I really don't even like the terms \"abstinence\" and \"celibacy\" because they don't really embody very well what \"abstinenence\"-proponents believe, for the most part. It's important that those terms be used with \"until-marriage\" because alone, they give the connotations of a lifetime of not having sex, which isn't the case. What defines the line for what constitutes promiscuity is difficulty to come to, but at least these religious people have drawn a line somewhere (rather than just 'if-it-feels-good-do-it\"). They draw that line at the marriage commitment, and that's what abstinence-before-marriage is all about.\n \n The real problem is that there are contingents of society that value sex over life-committed relationships (marriage), and as such sex is now viewed as fine outside of that context. The better way, IMO, is for young people to go into relationships looking to find life-long partners (and therefore not staying with those who wouldn't make good life-long partners), rather that someone to have sex with. For that to happen, it takes a societal cultural changes, which is what religious groups aim for.",

That just doesn't seem like sound reasoning to me. If it's the preferable thing, then we should strive toward it regardless of how hard it might be. It's that simple.\n\n I think you misunderstand my view of when I think abstinence would be preferable. My general view on sex is that I believe it is ok to engage in it for a wide variety of reasons - ranging from sex for the purposes of childbearing to sex for an emotional connection to a committed partner, to sex purely for physical pleasure - whether within a marriage or committed relationship or outside of one. I may not want to have anything romantic to do with someone who is sexually promiscuous since I prefer sex not only for physical reasons but for emotional connection in a relationship, but that does not mean that I would morally object to others engaging in sexual acts outside of a relationship context purely for physical pleasure. It is a matter of preference of lifestyles and priorities. I try to hold on to some version of religious beliefs but I am strongly against holding a moral belief without having a sound reason behind it - not simply that an authority tells me so.\n \n The main moral judgements that I make where sexual activities are concerned are judgments that require that such acts be pursued with a sense of responsibility (protecting oneself and ones partner from STDs or the risk of pregnancy), full consent of both partners (which requires both partners to be capable of the judgement necessary for consent), and intelligence (awareness of risks and both the physical and societal consequences). Most teenagers are too imature for most of these requirements since many, if not most, are not sufficiently mature to practice sex safely; they can often be intimidated or manipulated into having sex when it might not be their true choice; and they may not be aware of the physical risks or of the societal judgement of certain behaviors. For all of those reasons, I view that it would be better for most teenagers to abstain from sex. This may seem unfair to the minority of teenagers who are indeed responsible, capable of judgement, and aware of the risks and, personally, I would have no problem with those teenagers having sex. However, it would be hard to design a program pushing abstinence where the program says that it is ok for some but not for others since I suspect that all teenagers would put themselves in the category of being deserving of that right.",

   "I have to say that you both present very well-rounded arguments, some of the best I've seen on this website (w/out jabs and insults). My stand point on this whole issue is one of common sense and reality. I have a 16 year old sister and I know what teenagers are like, I used to be one and so did you jyoshu. In the real world, many teenagers think that they are mature enough to do adult things like have sex. We all know that whether or not they are mature they will and do have sex. So my thing is that instead of trying to persuade a teenager to \"follow god\" or \"wait until marriage\" (BTW, for your information not everybody wants to get married...that is not a pre-requisite for adulthood or sex), educate (sex-ed) them on the pros and cons of sex. Teach them to be MATURE about having sex, using protection and choosing the right partner for them. Give them places and people to talk to if they feel uncomfortable or can't go to their parents for whatever reason (this is where Planned Parenthood comes in, which has saved many a girls lives). \n \n Nobody is saying that abstinence is a bad thing; it's jus that some people do not WANT to practice abstinence but practice safe sex. We should not underestimate teenagers and just assume that because we preach abstinence until marriage that they will do that. Why can't we teach abstinence and safe-sex while giving them condoms and birth control incase they do have sex??? \n \n We need to stop teaching kids that sex and promiscuity is evil. That homosexuality or experimentation is a sin. We need to start teaching them that sex is natural and beautiful (yes I know it's a clich\u00e9).

   "I think you misunderstand my view of when I think abstinence would be preferable. My general view on sex is that I believe it is ok to engage in it for a wide variety of reasons - ranging from sex for the purposes of childbearing to sex for an emotional connection to a committed partner, to sex purely for physical pleasure - whether within a marriage or committed relationship or outside of one. I may not want to have anything romantic to do with someone who is sexually promiscuous since I prefer sex not only for physical reasons but for emotional connection in a relationship, but that does not mean that I would morally object to others engaging in sexual acts outside of a relationship context purely for physical pleasure. It is a matter of preference of lifestyles and priorities. I try to hold on to some version of religious beliefs but I am strongly against holding a moral belief without having a sound reason behind it - not simply that an authority tells me so. The main moral judgements that I make where sexual activities are concerned are judgments that require that such acts be pursued with a sense of responsibility (protecting oneself and ones partner from STDs or the risk of pregnancy), full consent of both partners (which requires both partners to be capable of the judgement necessary for consent), and intelligence (awareness of risks and both the physical and societal consequences). \n \n Most teenagers are too imature for most of these requirements since many, if not most, are not sufficiently mature to practice sex safely; they can often be intimidated or manipulated into having sex when it might not be their true choice; and they may not be aware of the physical risks or of the societal judgement of certain behaviors. For all of those reasons, I view that it would be better for most teenagers to abstain from sex. \n\n \n Indeed, then we agree more than we disagree. These are the same reasons that religious people teach teenagers to wait until marriage. That message however, is supposed to go hand-in-hand with parental guidance to not marry too young. (Lest teenagers get married for the sole purpose of having sex.)",

   "Nobody is saying that abstinence is a bad thing; it's jus that some people do not WANT to practice abstinence but practice safe sex. We should not underestimate teenagers and just assume that because we preach abstinence until marriage that they will do that. Why can't we teach abstinence and safe-sex while giving them condoms and birth control incase they do have sex???\n\n \n Or at least make it available, I agree.\n \n \nWe need to stop teaching kids that sex and promiscuity is evil. \n\n \n Promiscuity IS bad, IMO. When a person starts sleeping around with many different partners frequently, it only increases the chances of getting STDs in a given period of time--sooner or later protection might break down or be forgotten.\n \n But I agree with you about the \"sex is evil\" part. Though I really don't think that's hardly anyone's intended message these days. Most religious-right people don't think sex is evil; they just believe it is for marriage.\n \n \nThat homosexuality . . . is a sin.\n\n \n IMO, that's a whole different topic.",

   "Indeed, then we agree more than we disagree. These are the same reasons that religious people teach teenagers to wait until marriage. That message however, is supposed to go hand-in-hand with parental guidance to not marry too young. (Lest teenagers get married for the sole purpose of having sex.)\n\n I can see why one could think that holding off on sex until one is married at a sufficient age would lead to sex happening mainly in a responsible setting. However, I would disagree that marriage is a requirement for that setting to be responsible. The mental state of responsibility, capability of decision-making, and awareness of the risks of sex lies in the individuals that are engaging in sex much more than it lies in their marital state or any other official state they are in (ex. legal minors, etc.). \n \n I have no problem with two people of a sufficiently mature mental state engaging in sex - of whatever age and whatever marital / relationship status. However, we do have a responsibility, as a society, to give proper guidance on such matters to teenagers who are just starting to entertain the notion of having sex. Though, in the ideal world, I would hope that one could convince those teenagers not mentally ready for sex to abstain from it and I certainly agree that efforts should be made at trying to dissuade them through counceling of family and peers, etc. However, many, if not currently most, will most likely remain unpersuadable since teenagers tend to have an unrealistic view of their own maturity and capabilities. For the inevitably large group of otherwise mentally immature and unready teenagers that will engage in sex anyway, we need to give them a firm education in sexual responsibility (protection from STDs and pregnancy and the emotional / social implications of their actions). For this, we need to accept the fact that sex will happen and find an approach that will be most affective - where free distributions of condoms might well be one of the most affective methods. You seem somewhat open to teaching responsible sex to teenagers. How, then, would you balance your teaching of abstinence with teaching of sexual responsibility?",

   "Look Bassman, I never said \"if it feels good do it\"...you can't seem to get off that line. But the fact is, it DOES feel good and people WILL do it. THAT IS LIFE, that is how we create life and how we sustain ourselves as a species. \n \n BASSMAN: \"because the sexual relationship outside of the bonds of marriage is wrong.\"\n \n That is one of the most ridiculous arguments anybody can make on this subject. We all know that \"marriage\" isn't what it used to be. People get married too young because they feel that they need to start a family or...sadly want to have sex and you can't deny that it's possible that a lot of people get married for the wrong reasons because they feel pressure that unless they do get that piece of paper they will be living in sin. People now get divorced every day, most familys are broken etc etc. So I fail to see your reasoning for abstinence until marriage when it is perfectly fine for two mature adults to engage in sex without that silly piece of paper that means nothing in todays world. \"Living in sin\" is just something that Christian right-wing conservatives made up so that they could have more of a grasp on people's sex lives....just like they do today with homosexuals. Christians just can't seem to get out of other peoples bedrooms and it ###### me off. It is not as if homosexuals are f*cking in your front yard is it????....well now i'm off on a tangent. \n \n My point is, you need to think of a people argument besides the bonds of marriage because most reasonable people will #### all over that because they LIVE IN REALITY. Instead, why don't you talk about prevention of disease and the lowering of teen pregnancy and abortion. Now...what are ways to PREVENT those things from happening??? Hmmm....not preaching the bible to teenagers but EDUCATING them on the consequences of sexual activity. Then allowing them at least the chance to have access to PROTECTION.

Neither one of us had any interest in a romantic relationship, long-term or otherwise. We both got what we needed at the time from it, as far as friendship, companionship, and sexual release, and though the sexual part of the relationship ended years ago when I started dating my current partner, we are still friends in every sense. I have no regrets about that relationship. \n \n I fully admit that those kinds or relationships are very risky, as often the feelings and intentions of both parties are unblanced or become so after time.

   "Jyoshu: That's the problem I have with sexual-revolution-liberalism. It seems to think that the mere act of making bad things more visible and known will somehow magically make things better. Knowing more about evil things, in and of itself, does not make evil go away. It takes not doing evil. It may even take people needing to do things like not being promiscuous and actually viewing sex as something best for long-term committed relationships (marriage) rather than just some recreational activity. Perish the thought\n \n Where do you get that sex is evil? I seem to remember saying how I feel that many Christians think sex is \"evil\" or they don't like people doing what they want so they have to make sex this \"bad\" thing and people were telling me that I was wrong. Yet here you are saying that sex is evil. It is not sex that is bad it is the choices that people make. Just because some people make bad choices does not mean that sex in general is bad. Just because you don't like the fact that people are having sex without a piece of paper doesn't mean that they are out screwing everybody in sight.\n \n Again, this whole marriage thing is really getting ridiculous. The people on this forum arguing about how marriage is necessary for a healthy sexual relationship need to get their heads out of their asses. There are many relationships between two unmarried people that are more healthy than some marriages, but would you still say that those unmarried people shouldn't be having sex??? People commit adultery all the time, a marriage does not equal a healthy sex life.....when are you people going to realize that??",

Marriage also does not guarantee that any potential child would have a supportive home - either due to the couple being very poor, or disfunctional for one reason or another.\n \n Though I agree that promiscuity carries more risks than monogamy and I, personally, look down upon those who practice it (just like I may look down on those that indulge most obsessions), those risks can be significantly reduced by responsible behavior in using protection against STDs and pregnancy.\n \n Also, most single sexually active people (at least those that I am familiar with) tend to be along the lines of \"serial monogamists\" - having a limited number of longer term relationships. Such relationships are certainly safer than the truly promiscuous ones which you criticize.",

Lots of non-Christians are married. If a couple has made a life-commitment to each other, preferably public in some way, I consider that marriage. The question you should be asking yourself is \"what's so great about commitment\" rather than asking me \"what's so great about marriage.\" Marriage is just a term. A noun that represents a commitment between two people. I consider such a commitment I have described and marriage as the same thing. If a guy and girl were stranded on a deserted island away from church and everyone else, and they made a life-commitment to each other, I'd think of them as married.\n \n I'm not going to get into the homosexuality question here.

You say that you consider people having sex outside of marriage a bad thing and that people should refrain from that because it can lead to disease and abortions.

I suppose I could publicly profess my life-long commitment to my partner and our sex life would be justified in your opinion? Or would it have to be approved by a minister who belongs to a church that I don't believe in? \n \n I don't mind you using the term \"life-long commitment\" but you always follow it up with (marriage) which I think is unfair because who are you to say that marriage = commitment. As I've said before married people cheat all the time, a signed contract does not mean commitment.\n \n Your comment on two stranded people on an island who make a life-long commitment away from a church, that you would consider that a marriage bothers me.

Yet it's a justification I hear all the time \n \n Nobody is saying that abstinence is bad, it's just that it is not always realistic. You can preach safety all day long but we all know what teenagers are like, they love to rebel. The more you stuff \"safety\" down kids throats the more they are going to want to rebel. My solution is to teach teenagers that sex is a serious responsibility and action. They should not take it lightly if they are to engage. We should teach them all the risks and potential diseases. We should tell them that abstinence is okay, that waiting until marriage is their choice....not something to be forced upon them. We should also teach them that sex is something to enjoy for responsible participants. It's natural and can be a wonderful thing. We should let them know about places to go and people to talk to about contraception and safe sex. \n \n I would be an idiot to just let teenagers do whatever they want because it feels good or because they are going to do it anyways but that is the fact of the matter. My stand-point...which I keep repeating is that if we stop telling teenagers that sex is a NO-NO that they will be less likely to rebel against authoritative adults and practice safer sex if they know their options.",

Kids are already getting sex ed in terms of safe sex at schools and by the culture at large already. When kids go to abstinence conferences or whatever, they're getting an abstinence message that is being added on to what they are already getting.

Church groups don't focus on safe-sex aspect because the kids are getting that already in the majority of cases (your stats!).\n\n \n Jyoshu - I think we see that you, like most, believe in teaching both and that thelmoose's comments are directed at Bassman who supports teaching abstinence only. \n \n For the record - thelmoose's stats show that 35% of schools are teaching abstinence only - they do not indicate that the other 65% are excluding abstinence as an option in sex-ed. Plus I highly doubt anyone here has a beef with churches teaching abstinence programs, it's when huge hunks of information are left out of sex-ed programs in (public) schools that there is an issue. \n \n I agree with thelmoose, Bassman. You can utilize whatever fear tactics you like to ensure your daughter stays virginal or gets hitched, but you have no business demanding we adheare to your one and only path to morality by keeping our kids ignorant.",

   "Where are you quoting from here?\nI was quite taken by a book review in the Wall Street Journal, part of which follows:\n \n \n'Abstain From Evil' Was Once a Lesson In Pupils' Textbooks\n August 28, 2006; Page B1\n In early American public schools, there was no separation between church and state. Tenets of Christianity were embedded in almost every lesson and book, including spelling, reading, history, grammar, arithmetic and science.\n \n A was for Adam, B was for the Bible and C was for Christ. In arithmetic, \"How many days is it since the birth of Our Savior?\" In geography, \"Christianity is the prevailing religion of the leading nations of the world.\" In science, \"All parts of the solar system are framed and adjusted to answer exactly the purpose intended by the Creator.\" In nature, \"The more we examine the insect world, the more sensible do we become of the mighty power and goodness of God.\"\n \n The schoolbooks used by early Americans were supposed to teach literacy and knowledge, but they also had a broader purpose: to create a national character, instilling children with a belief in God and a moral code appropriate to the pious citizens of a new republic. While learning to read, students also had to absorb messages about religion, patriotism and other virtues, such as thrift, diligence and honesty. . . . As the country grew and diversified during the 19th century, and waves of immigrants brought their own faiths and opinions to the U.S., overtly religious references were dropped from most school texts. Lessons about virtue and goodness, however, continued. From late 19th-century spellers: \"Abstain from evil.\" \"Obey the law.\" \"Be on your guard against evil associates.\"\n \n Although early schoolbooks portrayed the world as a moral place, where virtue is rewarded and vice punished, they also didn't shrink from the cruel realities of life on the frontier (\"Xerxes did die/And so must you and I,\" said one speller).\n \n \"Schoolbooks made the 19th-century child thoroughly aware that life is hard and full of natural and manmade pitfalls,\" wrote Ms. Elson. \"It is his duty to strive for success, but he will struggle hard on the way.\"\n",

However, I have to agree with the others that you seem to be in the minority of conservative views in supporting both abstinence teaching and teaching of responsible sexual practices. \n \n As Thelmoose mentioned, 35% of school districts within the US support abstinence-only programs. Yes, that is the minority of school districts but, considering that there are roughly an equal percentage (~35% range) of people who might be classified as the religious right, that number comes into perspective. I'm sure that if the religious right came into undisputed power within the US, that number would go up significantly. It is those that are closed-minded about these issues - such as Bassman in his/her arguements here - that seem to dominate the right wing of the Republican party and the policies that it tries to implement. \n \n I hope that you are right and I am wrong about my estimate that most people on the religious right are closed minded on this issue. If I am wrong, then I sincerely hope that those who are more open-minded and moderate - such as yourself - speak out and influence the decisions which your party makes.",

Before the morality police jump in, the situation I am talking about is in a committed relationship (not that I have a problem, morally, with more spontaneous behavior, but that's another topic.)

I can understand that a Christian might find that morally offensive, but how is it any business of yours what two consenting adults do in their own bedroom...or kitchen or bathroom haha.

I can understand maybe 50 years ago people being concerned with that but now??? A lot of us were raised by one parent, or went back and forth. The divorce rate is so high now, not because people are having sex but because marriage is not what it used to be Bassman, you can't blame that on sex. It seems like people like you Bassman only want to concern yourself with the \"fetus\" or growing child because abortion goes against your beliefs but when the child is born, you stop caring. \n \n I think that you must be pretty blind if you think that society's message is \"if it makes you feel good, do it\", I see commercials and ads all the time telling kids to not do drugs, not smoke, that it's bad for you. To talk to their parents about sex and alcohol. The parents with some sense are going to realize that teens are going to get into some trouble in their lives and they better be protected because truthfully, God isn't going to always reach his hand down and save your child. \n \n Unacceptable 50% divorce rate?????? Ummm, Bassman, what are you going to do if two people no longer want to be married...throw them in prison because it is UNACCEPTABLE??? By you!?

What about them? Do you stop caring? This goes along the same lines as you wanting everybody to be Christian and moral with a halo on their head yet do not want to help those people that are in trouble....or those unwanted children. \n\n \n I've said this before, but there are completely non-religious reasons to hold to the idea that promiscuity is bad. And since marriage is really simply a very serious commitment between two people, avoiding sex before marriage is a very reasonable thing. It's not like it's a death sentance--unless you are entering into a relationship FOR sex, it shouldn't matter. \n \n Also, you seem to be adamant about portraying Bassman and others as trying to force something on you, and they're not. They simply believe that is best for society and are giving their views, just like you think promiscuity is fine for society, and you give your views. \n \n \nSecond, the devastation that I'm worried about is people being killed on earth right now, living birthing eating drinking sleeping people. Also, what about the devastation that these unborn children might experience with parents who dont want them or can't take care of them financially, physically or mentally.\n\n \n I've always thought the argument you're using that abortion somehow protects kids from harm they would experience in life is just about the most ridiculous argument for abortion there is. You're basically arguing we should protect kids by using harm.\n \n Even if it were legit, what about cases where the kid would have grown up with a good life? There are quite a few cases of people who survived abortions, and are more than glad they did. If your argument is that abortion is to protect kids from bad parents, why should adoption not be a better option? That way at least BOTH the kid lives AND gets a good set of parents (adoption procedures work toward that end).\n \n \nUmmm, men are going to do that regardless of marriage. Fix the men doing this, not Americans moral standards.\n\n \n Well, that's what Bassman's trying to do. When he talks about American moral standards, \"fixing\" the men doing this is part of what that is.\n \n \nThe sexual revolution brought about better education in schools on sex, more contraception options, less misogynist views towards womens sexuality, awareness of homosexuality (something that will not go away no matter how hard you pray) etc...... etc....... you need to step out of your cave you backward backward man.\n\n \n Wow, you really need to do some research on this. Much of what you're listing was a counter-balance against the sexual revolution, swinging back the other direction. When the sexual revolution occured, it involved many people not using protection; they weren't having sex responsibly; they weren't doing much of anything to avoid STDs. Orgies became popular, as well as a mixing sex with drug-use. Those were the values of your beloved sexual revolution. Thank goodness the values of the sexual revolution have been kept somewhat in check, and were beaten back by the things you describe along with religion.\n \n So you should thank your lucky stars that things didn't stay the way they were during the sexual revolution. If they had, there would probably be a lot less people alive today. Contraception, safe-sex education, religious culture, etc. saved us FROM the sexual revolution. That's why it's so ironic when proponents of the sexual revolution claim credit for the things you listed. We've been cleaning up the XXXX from the sexual revolution for 3 decades now through education, drug-awareness programs, moral culture change, and promoting responsible sex--and we're STILL doing so.",

Birth control - being able to decide not to be a mother (or to wait to be a mother), even if married.\n \n But it also taught us a hard publich lesson about what will happen when you are careless with your body and heart.

I just do not judge people if they decide to be promiscuious (unlike you). I do not feel it is my place and as a Christian it is not your place to judge either, I do not think you're supposed to do that....only your \"god\".\n \n \nI've always thought the argument you're using that abortion somehow protects kids from harm they would experience in life is just about the most ridiculous argument for abortion there is. You're basically arguing we should protect kids by using harm.\n \n Even if it were legit, what about cases where the kid would have grown up with a good life? There are quite a few cases of people who survived abortions, and are more than glad they did. If your argument is that abortion is to protect kids from bad parents, why should adoption not be a better option? That way at least BOTH the kid lives AND gets a good set of parents (adoption procedures work toward that end).\n\n \n How many kids are waiting for adoption today? I see those sappy commercials every day. How many more will we have if abortion is made illegal? Are you going to take care of them?\n \n \nWell, that's what Bassman's trying to do. When he talks about American moral standards, \"fixing\" the men doing this is part of what that is.\n\n \n Well Bassman will fail. I do not want to live in a country filled with \"moral police\" that will shake their finger at me for MY LIFESTYLE, and sorry to burst your moral bubble but I think a lot of people agree with me. \n \n Reading posts by Jyoshu, Bassman and Steve makes my skin crawl like I have spiders all over my body.",

   "This argument about sex-ed has always perplexed me. It's sort of like saying \"kids are going to steal anyway, so we should be sure and educate them on how to shoplift in a safe way.\" Just because many kids DO have sex (not all of them though) doesn't mean we shouldn't also promote abstinence.\n\n \n I find this quite strange. When has shoplifting ever become a natural and healthy activity?\n \n \n \nAnd as long as religion plays an important part in many peoples' lives, it will be part of the issue; there's no way to avoid that. Christians aren't afraid of sex; we're afraid of teenagers ruining their lives, getting STDs, pregnant when they can't support a child, etc.\n\n \n Ah, theres that good ol' Christian \"we know better than you so we're going to tell you what to do\".\n \n \n \nThose are 'fears' I'll continue to view as important fears, thank you. Promoting marriage as the context for sexual activity is not a bad thing. That's why sex education should be comprehensive and not JUST be about condoms and taking a \"they're-going-to-do-it-anyway\" approach.\n\n \n Even if they are going to do it anyway?\n \n \n \nThe problem is that anti-abstinence people constantly misrepresent the issue as a delimma between education-about-sex and abstinence. (Hence your comment above \"Will you turn your back to them and preach abstinence or give them the protection they need???\" Why do you assume it's completely an either/or thing??) But I've NEVER known a single person who advocated abstinence who didn't also understand the value of sex ed about protection as well. The idea of \"abstinence-only\" (in the sense of abandoning sex ed about protection) is mostly a myth. Even in the debate on federal funding, the govt. is not trying to eliminate sex ed funding--they are trying to make sure abstinence is part of the equation.\n\n \n It should be, but abstinence only education will not stop teens from having sex. Since when have teens ever listened to adults about what to do and what not to do? Especially when it is something their hormones are urging them to do. Do you think they will listen? Safe sex is a better way, because the teens can do what their bodies are telling them to in a safer way, rather than in an unsafe way.\n \n I should know that teenagers will not listen to adults when they are telling them not to do something that is fun and feels good, considering I am one.",
