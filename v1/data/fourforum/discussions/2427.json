   "The Crusades were almost three centuries of endless missions of basically pledged Christian military pillaging in attempts to free the Holy Land from Muslim control, ending in failure. There were other, lesser, crusades to other lands, but recovery of the Holy Lands provided the original rationalization of condoning violence in the name of the Christian God, still utilized to this day. The Pope called for crusades against his political enemies well into the 18th Century. England finally occupied the Holy Lands in 1917, as a result of the final collapse of the Ottoman Empire.",
