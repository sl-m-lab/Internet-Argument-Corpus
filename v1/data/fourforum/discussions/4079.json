   "From here\n \n \nPresident Bush, Vice President Cheney and other top administration officials asserted before the U.S. invasion in March 2003 that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear weapons program, had chemical and biological weapons, and maintained links to al Qaeda affiliates to whom it might give such weapons to use against the United States. \n\n \nBush has expressed disappointment that no weapons or weapons programs were found, but the White House has been reluctant to call off the hunt, holding out the possibility that weapons were moved out of Iraq before the war or are well hidden somewhere inside the country. But the intelligence official said that possibility is very small. \n\n \n Well... that was a successful little venture.",

The evidence we had that saddam still had WMDs was almost all from guys like Chalibi, who stood to gain enormously from US intervention in Iraq.\n \n It surprised even me, with my low opinion of the intelligence of your average American, when the media was reporting on how wChalibi had fallen out of favor, and the fact that he is the guy we got the majority of our WMD intel, and the fact that he had not actually been in Iraq for a number of years, that the Americna public did not wake up and say \"Hey, why were we taking intel from this guy, who has not been there for years, but ignoring the UN inspectors, who we hand picked and put on the ground there\".\n \n Those of us who pay attention outside of whatever bit of fluff the news networks are reporting on at the moment, laready knew who chalabi was, knew he was aspiring to be the next ruler of Iraq, and knew that he was providing us with most of our WMD intel. We also knew that odds are, he was unreliable, since he was obviously using the US to further his goal of being the eventual ruler of IRaq.\n \n It did not surprise me that joe sixpack had no idea what was going on. He rarely does. What frankly shocked the hell out of me is that even when they laid it all out together, Wants to rule the country.....enemy of saddams.....hasn't been in country for years......provided us with most of our WMD intel.....Joe sixpack still didn't pick it up. I came to the conclusion that my assesment of US citizens as some of the least thinking people on the planet was way off. I was giving my fellow Americans FAR too much crdit.",

This is idiotic. It would be suicidal for the russians to do such a thing and they know it. \n \n Second, in order for this to be true, you have to accept that the bush administration is for some reason keeping the fact that we found WMDs secret. This is also a follish ascertation. With all the negative press, and our world opinion ratings falling off a cliff, there is no way they would keep such a thing a secret. On the international stage, we have lost all credibility due to the fact that we have not found any WMDs (or anything near enough to be dangerous). If they were there, and we had found them, we sould have said soemthing, presented the evidence.\n \n I have no doubt that some US servicepeople have seen WMDs. The Un teams DID find some, which they tagged for destruction, and put into chemical dump sites so they could be encapsulated with concrete. In fact, they found a partial warehouse full of them, nearly 220 units. They were all too old to be useful (the chemicals had passed their shelf life), which is why they did not dispose of them immediatly, rather allowing the cheaper option of just putting them in a chemical waste dump. \n \n The US, on entering Iraq, failed to secure these dumps and some of the weapons have since disapeared. So, there are a few shells floating around. \n \n In 10 years of looking, the UN team never found viable weapons. By the end, they were literally inspecting garden sheds and outhouses, because every time they declared Iraq WMD free, the US added a bunch of inspection locations to their list. This last time around would have certainly been the end of inspections, since there was just no where else to look. ALL locations where there was a realistic possibility of finding WMDs had already been inspected and given a clean bill of health. They just weren't there. Get over it.\n \n Common sense dictates that they were not there. Our own inspectors say they were not there. The bush administration says they were not there. \n \n It is amazing how delusional people can be. When Bush, who stands to loose the most by admitting they were not there gets up and says we couldn't find any, and we have called off inspections because there is no reasonable expectation of finding any, it is time for even the most hard headed XXXXX to figure it out. \n \n \n \ndoes that clear some of it up? i'm not willing to name names, but this is what i've pieced together based on everything i've seen. saying there are NO weapons of mass destruction has to be a political move. the more likely story is that there WERE wmd weapons or possibly even wmd manufacturing facilities that were struck by special operatives that could not afford to be compromised (if you know what delta is, think along those lines but higher up, like the fenix project in vietnam, where nobody but the JCOS an the president knew about it)\n\n \n This is open war. No matter what force hits or finds a target, we can show it. You simply subsititute the responsible. You seems to be implying that you know some peopel in such a unit. IF that is the case, either you are a liar or they are. Soldiers in such a unit know better than to talk about anything that goes on in the field, or even to discuss their assinged unit, since discussing such things is a one way ticket to Leavenworth for the rest of their lives.\n \n Even Delta Force keeps quite about such things. For nearly 2 years I was stationed at Ft Bragg as a training officer. The entire time I was there I did not hear one soldier admit to being a member of Delta force, despite the fact that Bragg is the home of Delta Force, and everybody knew who they were. Once they are out, some guys get loose lipped enough to tell you that trhey were in Delta Force. For somebody who is still inside to do so is generally a one way ticket to prison (there are exceptions).\n \n Nobody knew about the Phoenix project? How about the majority of the CIA. Phoenix was a CIA project. Even the south Vietnamese knew about phoenix. Following the Tet offensive they officially endorsed it. Pheonix was little more than a death squad. \n \n There would be no need to create a cover story, or even to utilize special ops personel in this case. WE WON THE WAR. We controlled the whole country for a fairly significant period of time. Besides what we blew up on the way in, we had access to every Iraqi government facility, research facility, and every record held by the Iraqi government. \n \n If you still believe there were WMDs, you are delusional. There is no evidence that they existed, but plenty that says they didn't. I do not doubt that there are servicemen out there claiming to have seen them. Some may be telling the truth, most are probably not. \n \n Going into IRaq, not a single unit was tasked with finding WMDs, nor were there any contingency plans for securing them if found. It was not until the invasion was over that a unit was specifically tasked with finding and securing them, and even they were not actually equipped to secure them, which rather highly suggests that they did not really expect them to find any. \n \n Falling back on hypothetical secret units, so secret that only the president and joint chiefs knows of their existance (which is a farce for many reasons....if you really want me to go into it I can, think real hard about that one, though) in the face of the fact that our own president has admitted that there were no WMDs, despite the fact that in doing so , immesurable harm has been done to the US on the interntional stage, is ludicrous.\n \n It is time to grow up and accept the fact that mistakes were made, and move on.",
