   "Talk about living in a fantasy world!!! You define the term. Can you show any evidence that society not only condones but sponsors gay bashing? Last I saw we have laws against it.\n\n \n No, there are no laws against gay bashing. There are assault laws, that are applied as society sees fit. Gays are renounced by society, all the while society pretends to protect gays. Sometimes light sentences are used, under the guise of \"he had psychiatric issues\" and so on.\n \n Society knows that so many assualts are going to occur under this system of society. They know that. They simply try and direct these assaults against those whom are deemed less important to the current regime, such as gays, criminals etc.\n \n Society is based on the family unit. A father, mother, children as poison containers. Society wants to enslave humans together via the marriage ritual. It wants you to have vaginal sexual intercourse, because it knows this leads to more citizen-slaves being born. By promoting this as a \"social norm\", and by pressuring that citizen-slaves conform to society, it automatically promotes negativity against gays.\n \n I know in tasmania, laws have even been passed that police can spy on gays and arrest them. Then the law is revoked, but it sent its intended message.\n \n Gays are commonly demonised. For example, little kids will call another kid \"a XXXXXX\". This is meant as a derogatory term. Yet if asked, the children would not even know their own sexual identity. They dont understand what XXXXXXX are. Yet they know to use the word. WHo taught them? Society taught them.\n \n Ask other human down the pub. There will be plenty of dissent against gays, yet little to none against \"regular\" sexual intercourse. If you think that western cultures promote or support gays, or that gays are popular, then you are sadly mistaken.\n \n \nOr citizen arrest assaults?\n\n These forms of assault are common in the various newspapers. Often we hear of a drug addict burgling a home, to be chased down the street (or later seen walking away) to be violently bashed by the occupants, with the support and condonement of society.\n \n I knew a man in prison who was bashed into a wheelchair. His jaw was busted up. His neck broken. He had tried to rob cathartically enraged humans with a knife (he usually took a gun, not this time). The man had 3 friends with him,and they bashed him, maybe with metal object too, I cannot recall. The police charged him, refused to charge the attackers. Common story.\n \n \nBased on your complaints, it sounds to me like you have had some personal experiences such as a citizen arrest that was rough on you because you refused to submit to it\n\n No, I have never been assaulted like that. It would be a serious mistake for any normal person to engage in combat with Me. There are no average mainstream humans that could attempt to defeat Me. I am abnormally strong, and well trained in dealing with you creatures. I will use any tactic necessary.\n \n \nand when you were going through the process of being prosecuted you ran head long into cops and a prison warden so now you think it's the norm.\n\n I have had great experiance in these fields. While never seriously physically assaulted by prison guards etc (by serious I mean punched etc), I have had in My many, many years and many encounters with the police and prison guards known such assaults are regular as clockwork.\n \n Savage hidings on handcuffed and restrained prisoners that last for hours. The screams, wails and smackng slamming sounds were music to My ears. This prisoner had cut himself in the high-security section. He was stripped naked, brutalized and sexually abused by 6+ guards.\n \n Another young boy (18) came in. He was regularly knocked about and sexually molested by a giant black man in front of the officer station on a regular basis.\n \n Another old man prisoner, whom I knew, was a gardener. A certain senior officer would always comment on his bent over position while gardening, and make suggestion to forced anal sex on a regular basis.\n \n I can give 100's of accounts.\n \n \nAnd from your problem with bashing child molesters, that may have been what you were being prosecuted for. What do you say, anything you would like to share with us?\n \n\n I personally have never harmed a child. Thats My way. I dont target children. Some do. We all have a Truth-based right to harm children, if we wish to. I have no desire to harm kids.\n \n \nWhat appears to be the norm is your irrational rants which have no place in common sense discourse.\n\n What you think constitutes common sense is nothing more than the mindless mantra you use to deny Truth.\n \n \nYou compare Boxing, the long respected art of pugilism with child abuse?\n\n Boxing is a violence act.\n \n \nIn case you missed it Boxing is two skilled opponents matching wits and skills against each other whereas child abuse is an adult with all the power beating a defenseless child. Get a clue travis, or get professional help.\n \n\n Boxing is violence. Thats the point. Society sponsers boxing. Thats the point. All those acts are violence acts, sponsered by society.

   "Usually I stay out of the abortion debate. But since Travis has seen fit to post his BS moonshine here, I'm gonna cast my fist into the ring.\n \n \n\"Abortion is not murder. Murder is illegal. Since Abortion is legal, it cannot be murder.\"\n \n This is the formal structure of the ridiculous and false arguments to suggest that abortion is not murder.\n\n \n Under current law standard a fetus is neither a person nor an animal. So by the current standard of review abortion can't be considered murder, because you can only commit murder of a human, not a thing.\n \n \nThere are some very rare cases where abortion is legitimately allowable by society. However, most abortions do not fall under this catagory.\n\n \n That's not for you to decide. You are neither God nor legislator.\n \n \nAs usual I emerge triumphant. None of your inferiors have managed to put up even the slightest resistance to My Superior arguments.\n \n I win.\n\n \n Lloyd Demause smokes like a chimney and slurps down coffee like it's going out of style.\n \n \nThe mothers rights argument is based on human rights. They say that the womb-trapped child is not human, therefore her right trumps the child's right not to be brutally and callously murdered.\n\n \n That's the standard of law we have right now. If you don't like it, protest that the fetus is recognized as a sentient living human and get that fact recognized as law.\n \n \nGay-bashings are societally-sponsored cathartic rage release events. Your society sponsers gays being targeted.\n\n \n Gay bashing is recognized as a hate crime in this country. So it's not \"societally-sponsored\", it's punished.\n \n \nSociety hates any citizen-slave enjoying sex without the possibility of creating a child.\n\n \n Lesbian porn seems quite popular actually.\n \n \nHowever, to conclude that drinking, smoking and any other form of drug-taking is \"ok\" is insane. There is no logical reason for you to link being assaulted, society's insane male-female sex decrees, and taking of mind-altering and inferior Truth-denying substances.\n\n \n If the truth involves suffering a migraine because taking ibuprofen is wrong, I'd rather not know the truth.\n \n \nIt is murder, you and they are wrong.\n\n \n Not until the law says it is. Until then your position is nothing more than pure opinion.\n \n \nYou are clearly dumb. You do not meet My Superior quality control standards. Goodbye.\n\n \n If that were true you'd quit replying here.\n \n \n\"Abortion is not murder. Murder is illegal. Since Abortion is legal, it cannot be murder.\"\n\n \n Abortion can't be classified as murder because the fetus isn't legally recognized as being alive. The fetus can't even legally qualify as a separate individual because it's completely dependent on the mother living for it to continue to exist. At best it rates the same as the mother's appendix or gall bladder, or even bacteria.\n \n \nYou cannot show how temporary lack of \"sentience\" should matter.\n\n \n Without sentience one simply can't be a person, even if they are human. Without sentience you're at best an animal. As an animal the most your killer can be charged with is cruelty to an animal.\n \n \nWhat a joke. Society does condone and sponser acts of violence.\n\n \n There are times when violence is justified.\n \n \nYou are wrong. Mainstream society is more violent, judgmental and fascist than any other fringe group could ever be.\n\n \n Priests are a lot worse. Raping children, embezzling from the church funds, and not to mention those who still believe human sacrifice is right and orderly.\n \n \nSociety condemns gays because it knows they wont create new citizen-slaves for them, and they challenge the family unit. Thats the Truth. It condones violence towards gays. At the same time, society needs to keep up an illusion of decency, so it s always pretending that it is trying to help gays, when it is doing nothing of the sort. Society is two faced.\n\n \n Society has laws making it a hate crime to use violence against gay individuals.\n \n \nBoxing and child-abuse are both forms of violence, just like the other forms mentioned. Just like bullying is a societal sponsered violence form.\n\n \n Child abuse results in you having your children taken away from you so you can't hurt them anymore. Prove otherwise.\n \n \nThat was not the point. The point was that you needed a definition of what Truth is, which is absurd to the point of being retarded.\n\n \n The common cop out of someone who doesn't know their own message.\n \n \nYou have no legitimate individual freedoms or rights. Only the false promises and definitions of these things society offers you.\n\n \n The language of our founding documents, like the Constitution itself, says otherwise. Our Founding Fathers recognized that we, as the superior species on this planet, are enumerated with rights from God, not from what some political figurehead declares.\n \n \nI do not flip-flop. You avoid. Society clearly sponsers and condones boxing, and the other forms of violence I mentioned. You claimed society never promotes violence, I have you examples, and now you are too petty and small to admit you were wrong.\n\n \n When there are set rules, guidelines and punishment for foul play, it doesn't qualify as violence.",

I asked admin to forward that opening post and his IP address to the FBI for consideration that he might just be capable of killing people randomly since I consider defending a serial killers right to murder people a public threat to do the same thing. I didn't ask for him to be banned, but maybe admin PMd a warning to him and Travis threatened him also. Either way, I'm afraid for anyone who lives in the vicinity of where he resides. And here's why:\n It is dangerous to \"entertain\" sinful thoughts.\n \n The road to sin begins in your thought life.\n \n When you commit a sin, it never \"just happens.\" Sinful acts begin as attitudes or temptations in your mind and emotions.\n \n For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly (Mark 7:21-22).\n \n Each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death (James 1:14-15).\n \n What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don't they come from your desires that battle within you? (James 4:1).\n \n We should try to act properly, but it's even more important to deal with our thoughts and emotions, since they are the source of our sinful actions.\n \n Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean (Matthew 23:26).\n \n Don't fantasize about sin, thinking that your thoughts are harmless. When you cherish sin in your heart, you put a wedge between yourself and God.\n \n If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened (Psalm 66:18).",

I didn't ask for him to be banned, but maybe admin PMd a warning to him and Travis threatened him also. Either way, I'm afraid for anyone who lives in the vicinity of where he resides. And here's why:\n It is dangerous to \"entertain\" sinful thoughts.\n \n The road to sin begins in your thought life.\n \n When you commit a sin, it never \"just happens.\" Sinful acts begin as attitudes or temptations in your mind and emotions.\n \n For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly (Mark 7:21-22).\n \n Each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death (James 1:14-15).\n \n What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don't they come from your desires that battle within you? (James 4:1).\n \n We should try to act properly, but it's even more important to deal with our thoughts and emotions, since they are the source of our sinful actions.\n \n Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean (Matthew 23:26).\n \n Don't fantasize about sin, thinking that your thoughts are harmless. When you cherish sin in your heart, you put a wedge between yourself and God.\n \n If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened (Psalm 66:18).\n\n \n Can you post anything without quoting scripture? \n \n Wouldn't it just be enough to say that anyone who speaks openly about how it's alright to freely kill innocent people is someone we should consider dangerous? Do you think that the inclusion of scripture will in some way legitimize this point? Even I, a godless, pit-dwelling, stiff-necked christ denying infidel (as Easy likes to call people like me) know that it is wrong to unjustly deny another human being their life. And what is absolutely amazing is that I didn't need the bible to tell me that.",

   "\"Abortion is not murder. Murder is illegal. Since Abortion is legal, it cannot be murder.\"\n \n This is the formal structure of the ridiculous and false arguments to suggest that abortion is not murder.\n \n \"It cannot be murder, because abortion is legal.\" Amazingly, you citizen-slaves fall for this illogical and ridiculous rant.\n \n The argument is illogical because it pre-supposes that abortion not being murder is valid in the premise. It does not matter if you do it, or the law supposes the premise True.\n \n It is also illogical because the definition of murder used has an arbitrary operator (\"illegal\"), and no legitimate definition can have such an arbitrary operator as a part.\n \n The idea that deliberately killing a womb-trapped child is not murder is insane, lie-based and ridiculous.\n\n \n The purposeful taking of life regulated by the government is something that is decided by the people. The people decide what determines what is allowable and what is not. When it is acceptable and when it is not. This is done in agreement, obviously not unanimous. Theses laws are created by the view of society at the time. Our society permits the ability to change those laws as our values change. \n \n You may call it murder, but you are wrong. There is no logical argument you can present to make your view correct. To suggest that legal abortion is anything else is an expression of your frustration why others don't share your views. There is no logic in your argument it's pure emotion and an immature understanding of how to cope with problems that don't go your way. \n \n If you think your view is indeed the view that is best for the people then be thankful in the US the opportunity exists for you to effect that. I can assure you though lieing about it, sensationalizing it, bullying people about it isn't going to get many people to consider you. \n \n Please do us both a favor before you go off on a discourse of the rights, or feelings or value of the fetus remember what I said about we as a society decided what is acceptable and what is not. We make these laws for ourselves for that reason, because we do attempt to value life. That attempt does not always satisfy all of the people all of the time, but it never will.\n \n I don't need a formula to understand how our society functions nor do I stomp my foot and throw insults or intimidate people who don't see you being right. Nor would I justify behavior that from anybody else concerning something of less import would be unacceptable. If you don't like the law, then do something about it. If this is what you deem to be the best and most effective way to do that, I suggest you find a to become comfortable with it.",

   "The simplest economy is a person by himself, on an island.- symbiote\n you need to realize something buddy. if 4 people are one a small island with plenty of resources for them then they will do fine. if there are 2 women and 2 men than they will soon have more people on the island after a few years however when there is a larger population the island they either expand to other islands, regulate births or over populate and die out. we must do something similar, the most clean and dignified thing would be to expand, but to where? the stars are most ideal but they are so very far away. we could go up in to the sky by building tall buildings but eventually we would again run out of room since the atmosphere doesn't go on forever. these are the arguments i have already presented. but now i think i have a solution. in stead of star other than our own why not create satellites orbiting the sun? we already have satellites with people in them orbiting the earth, why not create satellites that can go close to the sun and grow plants. the suits astronauts wear have tinted glass to protect their eyes so on a much larger scale it could work for satellites. it is definitely a half cooked plan but it could work i think, or at least give us time. i would like opinions.",
