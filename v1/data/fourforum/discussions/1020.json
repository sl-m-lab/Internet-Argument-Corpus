I am trying to see the logic of the stance you take. As you have done with my beliefs.\n \n What makes them sick? Who are you to judge? Who/what gave you the right?\n \n \n you don't like my beliefs right? well, you have every right to feel that way, and i respect the fact that you can feel any way you want to.\n\n \n I don't dislike you. But I dislike your beliefs. I believe they are hypocritical, because you're saying you don't judge people/acts, yet you call these acts despicable... unless you are just stating that you feel that they are despicable, and not that they actually are despicable.\n \n \n but don't make it sound like i support genital mutilation or paedophilia.\n\n \n I never said you do. I asked you a question. I didn't address this forum to you. But, I think I asked you similar questions on another thread... and this was in no way meant to imply that. I am sorry if it seemed to suggest so.\n \n \n and yes, most Russians, and Germans, and Italians are Christian...and most who fought in WWII were Christians...albeit not good Christians. but then again, what were the Crusades? Christians killing Muslims in the name of god? get over it...and don't confuse religion with politics. Nazi was a political affiliation...not a religion. Communist is a political affiliation...not a religion.\n\n \n Tell me, if you meet a bad Hindu... should we judge all Hindus by that person's actions?\n \n a) yes\n b) no\n \n if b) 'no' then your argument about Crusades, Italian Christians etc is pointless... unless, you have some maths formula, that you will only judge a faith when there's a threshold of bad people in it. Although you admit that they were 'not good Christians' you threw in a qualifier... \"but then again, what were the Crusades? Christians killing Muslims... blah blah.\" So, you're not really certain you shouldn't be judging at least some of them.\n \n You say you don't judge Christians, but you just have. You've judged all Christians by the actions of some (albeit a lot; but then there's a whole lot of Christians). In fact you judge Christians by my actions too. I have said that I am Orthodox Christian, so I imagine you believe all Orthodox Christians to be arrogant and rude - which I am.\n \n \nby your logic i must be a Christian to follow democratic capitalism?\n\n \n I'll assume you're asking me and not telling me by use of rhetorical ploys. I am a socialist. I've never voted conservative in my life. I was a paid up member of the Australian Labor Party until they became too reactionary. I am always a member of a union, when there is one. I believe in social justice issues;* and currently vote for the Greens. I donate blood. I've done volunteer work with too homeless shelters, and English language tutoring program for migrants, work with the Spastic Centre. etc. I am not pro-capitalist.\n \n If you check my posts on this forum (on gun-control for example), there is someone there who would swear that I am a communist.\n \n I do this because my God was concerned with the well-being of people. However, He left us morals to live by, and didn't say 'go out and do your own thing.'\n \n \n you seem to think that because i don't follow the Christian god or a strict regimented religion that my beliefs are frivolous. that is exactly what my ancestors fled from in the first place\n\n \n This is a correct assessment. What little I know of your beliefs, or paganism/wiccan/magic etc does lead me to that conclusion; also based on the fact that those beliefs themselves are found to be true solely by your own judgment.\n \n \nyou could believe that homosexuals deserve to die for who they are, and i respect your right to believe that. but if you go out and start killing them, then you deserve to be locked away for life. do you see the difference? \n\n \n I am not in favour of homosexuality. I have at least one friend is gay,** he is also a communist so on politics we are fairly close. I am not for the death penalty in any circumstances, both these beliefs stem from the fact that I believe we are created beings (therefore special), with a purpose in life (not homosexuality).\n \n \n i will not be responding to your postings any more Mont, as you have twisted enough of my words around already. i don't mind honest debate, but yelling at a brick wall accomplishes little\n\n \n What I am guilty of is being consistent with what I believe to be right. I believe that I am being honest in this. I like the analogy of a brick wall. I wish I could be as steadfast in my faith as that. I don't mind discussing things with you, but you're the one who says you're not judgemental!\n \n \n \n \n This has all gone rather off topic, and oddly enough it seems I have to justify my existence to you, because you have judged (or rather misjudged) me.\n \n \n *earlier this year I was at a demonstration against our draconian immigration policies, and I got kneed and stomped on by the police.\n \n ** I tend to argue with him only on degrees of politics and on evolution.
