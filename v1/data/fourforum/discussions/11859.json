This spike also comes after a report that single-family homes prices fell a record 16.6% from a year ago.

We know that smoothing was an attempt to eliminate that and thus influence stock prices. Small levels of volatility is rather minor.\n \n But you are right in that volatility in the sheer size we see today is a bad, bad, bad thing. Jumps and declines of 600+ points daily is frightening.
