   "Evidence that points to a conclusion\n (All other 'possibilities' are pure speculation.)\n \n For some time I?d heard a story about a so-called ?wild-child?; a French boy reportedly raised by wolves. Studies into his cognitive abilities showed that he had normal intelligence, however he could not learn complex language.\n \n By complex language, I mean the ability to deal with ethereal concepts, involving space and time. Thus, if he wanted milk, he?d say the (French) word for milk, but he couldn?t construct a sentence such as ?I?d like to meet with you sometime in the future?, not just because he had no grasp of complex grammar, but because he?d had no exposure to concepts dealing with things other than his immediate self. It should also be noted that complex language itself can ?evolve? to become more complex.\n \n Similar findings were made when another ?wild-child? emerged into the light of science in the USA in the 1960s. This child, a girl, had spent the first fourteen years of her life chained to a toilet. Her abusive parents had not communicated with her. When taken in by social workers and speech pathologists she was taught rudimentary English language, but again there seemed to be a lost level of understanding.\n \n It was shown that a child needs to be exposed to complex language at a particular stage of life, or, that skill will never be acquired. It is a unique time-based skill, that is unlike others. You can, at any age in your life learn another language, or, another skill, such as how to build a bridge, or perform a medical operation, but the ability to acquire the skills of complex language have a time-frame on them; if you don?t learn them when the time is right, you will never learn them.\n \n This led me to ponder the problem of complex language? who taught our cave-man ancestors? Cave-man would have had to been exposed to complex language as a child, by adults who themselves would have had to have learnt it as a child.\n \n It is not enough that they could come up with a word for ?fire? and build up from that. Noam Chomsky suggests that we already have pre-wired into our brains, the ability for language. However, like a computer with the hardware, it needs an outside source to start the software.\n \n Could complex language had evolved? This is the recourse of my detractors, to prove that it hasn?t evolved is next to impossible, and thus it will always remain a ?possibility?.\n \n However the main stumbling-block to this is, as mentioned earlier, it needs to be taught!\n \n Secondly we can find parallels in nature. Caroline Goodall spent years observing chimps. She noticed on one occasion that a juvenile chimp happened upon a cache of food. Immediately an instinctive response was uttered, that of chirping happily. Unfortunately this noise drew the attention of older chimps who came and took the food for themselves. Goodall noticed that the next time the chimp found food, it tried to suppress this noise, but almost choked. Even as it managed to reason, it could not control its communicative responses.\n \n Next we have a case of a gorilla that has supposedly been taught to construct sentences using colored and pictured keypad. If this were true, it would show that gorillas have always had the capacity for language, but until taught by someone who already had complex language, gorillas have been unable to miraculously develop such skills. Likewise, dolphins and dogs too can be taught levels of communication, which although vastly inferior to that of humans, is still greater than that achieved naturally over millions of years.\n \n A common objection\n I have put this idea to others on another forum, and they universally come up with a case in Nicaragua involving deaf-children. I will deal quickly with the case, and how it doesn?t relate to my case.\n \n Nicaragua previously stigmatized deaf-children. They paid no money fo the facilities to educate and cater to deaf-children. Then, a change in government saw the establishment of that nation?s first institute for the deaf. All the children that were brought into the institute, (none of whom had been formally trained in the national sign-language) were observed interacting with each other and forming a new language.\n \n The proponents of this fail to recognise two important factors.\n 1) the children were each taught in their own homes by parents or guardians an ad hoc language that was known only to those family members\n 2) the staff of the institute, although played a minimal part in the development of this new language, still played a part\n Thus, the case of these children is likened to that if someone who speaks English, is cast-adrift with someone who speaks Swahili, learn to find a way of communicating with each other, based upon the firm grounding that each already knows a language. What is remarkable about the Nicaraguan case is that each child had a language unto itself, and that they were all deaf.\n \n My open question to you Dear Readers,\n Please show me where complex language has arisen spontaneously or over millions of years.\n This is what I find interesting about evolutionaries. All the evidence I see points in favour of my theory. It doesn?t ?prove? my theory but it is certainly the best theory for the evidence at hand? never-the-less evolutionaries will react unfavourably to this tract.",

   "References and Notes\n \"Wild Children \n From time to time, there appear in our midst beings who challenge our conception of what it means to be human. These beings are often referred to as wild children or wolf children. They are often tragic figures, offering glimpses of what might have been, of fully human intelligence that somehow does not enable them to live a social life. This is particularly true if they are already through puberty when they are found. They suggest to us that there may be a 'critical age', an age beyond which any child who has somehow missed out on learning a language will never completely master one.\" \n http://perso.club-internet.fr/tmason/WebPages/LangTeach/Licence/CM/OldLectures/L3_ExtremeCircs.htm \n http://www.csun.edu/~vcoao0el/de361/de361s52_folder/tsld009.htm about the French wild child or \n http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2112gchild.html about the American one. \n Much of the debate centres around whether language is innate, and still needs to be learnt, or whether it is just learnt. None of it (that I am aware of) suggests that it just spontaneously arises. \n Secondly the issue of Nicaragua was not raised by me initially in other postings. \n Some people might say, \"Oh, English is different today then what it used to be\"\n Regardless of English coming from Middle English etc. It's still a case of one complex language giving rise to another. \n Nicaraguan children\n \"The age at which signers first enter the Nicaraguan signing community predicts their ultimate ability to command some of its more complex structures. Signers who arrived at a young age produce more complex, multi-morphemic signs and use the inflectional and verb agreement system more than signers who entered the community at an older age. These findings are consistent with theories that claim that children*s language-learning abilities DECREASE with age\"\n http://web.mit.edu/mitwpl/dissertations/senghas.abstract.html \n This re-enforces the age-limit idea of language acquisition. And as I've said, the two examples where children have been brought up without the interaction of complex language at the right times in their lives has shown that the CAN NOT then acquire complex language!\n Teaching Apes to talk\n It is believed that language is a complex integrated system. Studies by Wilkins & Wakefield (1995), Curtis (1977), Johns & Newport (1989), Goldwin-Meadow (1979), and even Savage-Rumabugh (1986) all suggest this. The later case showed that chimps could learn complex language in signing, however this was only at being taught by humans - a case of intelligence giving a helping hand. \n How is language different from say, building a bridge? Well you can learn medicine, engineering etc at any stage of your adult life... People in their 50s can go to med school, in their 40s they can go to college and study another language. However, as the studies above show, language is a time-specific skill. \n An increasing complex grammar or syntax is itself not proof. All living-languages grow as they come into contact with other languages and new situations. It is too easy to use the word evolution in this case?\n Might be Possible\n But, let's for a moment look take a pro-evolutionary language side, at what an article actually says... \n ?In order to understand how organisms are shaped by evolution (phylogeny), it is also necessary to consider the development of the individual (ontogeny). A serious ambiguity in the term \"capacity\" can confuse matters here. \"Capacity\" is sometimes used to mean what one will have achieved as a mature organism, but at other times to mean what one could have achieved in all other possible worlds. Because we have neural (and other kinds of) plasticity, we are born with the potential to develop in different ways in alternative worlds; that is, we have potentials which will only be realized in particular environments. In this sense, most of the potential of every organism is latent and unrealized, since each of us lives in only one of these possible worlds. For example, chimpanzees have the capacity to learn to communicate with signs and lexigrams (Savage-Rumbaugh, 1986), but they cannot realize that capacity without the special environment of skilled human intervention (cf. Wilkins & Wakefield, 1995:176). Likewise, humans require an environment containing a certain level of language use - more than what some of Yoshinaga-Itano's subjects have been getting - in order to realize their capacity for language. Apparently, the input must be richer, perhaps as rich as a pidgin, for syntactically complex language to develop3. So the first hominids who had a brain with the capacity for language - that is, who had the developmental potential for language - could not have actually realized a syntactically complex language, because there would have been no adequate model for them to hear. This state of affairs might have persisted for millennia, until at least a pidgin-like level had been reached. The phylogenetic development of language might have been excruciatingly slow, spiraling up gradually; generations of pre-syntactic speakers might have put together a few words, gestures, and facial expressions, with recursive structures only at the discourse level.?\n http://www.lab-io.it/abstract/abs67.htm \n Note their wording \"This state of affairs might have persisted for millennia\" How do they know? Because we have complex language now! Circular reasoning! They don't know for sure, the best they can come up with is a maybe. \n Also, how do they define pidgin language? In the next paragraph. ?Pidgins develop in a world where most of the speakers have command of some other, fully developed language? In other words, they already have a complex language! So, a circular argument emerges, using their own definition... that somehow over time people used a form of language, that is only available to people who already have a fully-formed language!\n \n Anyway, as I said, the evidence, what little there is, points to one theory. I look forward to many evolutionaries debunking this on the grounds of the amount of evidence... when they do a similar job with evolutionary theory. I too, will use their tactic and say that the evidence I present here does not 'prove' my theory, but the evidence suggests the theory is fact! This is my case of serving back at them some of their own medicine with regards truth, proof, theory and fact.\n emoticon_smile \n And then they have to explain who taught the cave-man to speak! I won't say that the theory points to God, but certainly an intelligent force must have taught cave-men, regarldless whether you believe that to be God, aliens, a giant super-computre, or a yellow Honda Accord.\n \n PS, my belief in God does not rest on this theory.",

   "In fact I recognise two things about my theory\n a) it will never be conclusively knowable (until the next life)\n b) if it were shown beyond any doubt at all that language could not evolve from nothing, that this itself would not prove that God was involved - it could have been aliens, someone might conjecture.\n\n \n Montalban, a technical point: you didn't present a \"theory\", at least not in the scientific sense. To be a theory, your description must offer an explanation as to why we see what we do see, and it must offer predictions of observations that we have not yet seen. If your \"theory\" is that God created humans 6000 years ago and endowed them with an innate ability for language, but language must be learned in childhood, this does not quite count as a scientific theory for two reasons:\n \n 1) It doesn't explain why she created us as she did. Why not create us with the ability to learn the first language at any age? Why not create us with the innate ability to speak a particular certain language?\n \n 2) I don't see how we can make any predictions out of this.\n \n Notice that my ideas also don't quite count as a theory, either, since they are too vague to produce any predictions.",
