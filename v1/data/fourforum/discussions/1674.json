We now find out that the deficit for 2003 will be $400 billion plus. Next years projected deficit is $530 billion with no end in sight. That&#8217;s over $20,000 per US family. Much more savings like this and we&#8217;ll all soon be bankrupt.",

   "But tax cuts work at increasing revenue. \n\n \n Revenues go up every year. Ever hear of inflation? Except the third year of the Reagan administration when revenues actually went down which was such a shocker that he signed tax increases to cut the deficit.\n \n \nReagan doubled federal revenues over his eight year term. If only he and Congress wouldn't have kept their spending up at a similar pace...\n\n \n Well almost but no cigar. Revenues went up 176% during his two terms. During Clinton&#8217;s two terms, revenues went up 186%. So tell me again how tax cuts increase revenues? :)\n \n \nI don't like how there is no focus on the national debt. We are 7 trillion dollars in debt... by 2014, which is when we will return to a surplus according to the CBO, we'll be about 9 trillion dollars in debt. Soon we'll be paying 200-400 billion dollars just to cover our interest payments... \n\n \n That&#8217;s the optimistic scenario.\n \n \nBut I don't think a Democrat could do any better.

So it still looks like 2014 would be our return to surplus, no matter who is in office. And instead of spending the surplus, let's focus on paying down the debt.\n\n \n The problem with your statement is that the budget has actually been balanced under a Democratic President. Bush has no credibility in this area as he has squandered the surplus he inherited and turned it into the biggest deficit in US history. So now he wants you to believe him when he suddenly has a change of heart and says he&#8217;ll do better when the election is near. Are you really that gullible?",

   "In the U.S., there are approximately 150 million workers. That translates to 150 million taxpayers out of a population of 290 million people.\n \n The U.S. government (does not include state and local governments) pays about 350 billion dollars a year on the interest on the debt. That translates to an average of over $2,300 per taxpayer per year.\n \n If there was no debt or if the debt was much, much smaller, every taxpayer in America would have an extra $2,300, on average, in their pocket to spend every year. One would think this \"extra\" money would help the economy quite a bit, far more than a one-time $300 \"buy your vote\" tax relief.\n \n Now the average American taxpayer should wonder where is this money going since it is clearly not in their hands? Better yet, what are the voting patterns of the people who benefit from this money? The more people understand the significance of the second question, the more they will understand why certain parties are not interested in fixing the deficit, much less the debt (other than providing lip service to win elections).\n \n Instead, we have people trying to increase the debt to keep up with inflation. The only way to decrease the debt is to have a \"surplus\" -- so, in reality, there is never a \"surplus\" as long as the debt exists. To ensure that the debt keeps growing to keep up with inflation, there must be a deficit.\n \n It is like a bank account. If you were living off the interest, you would want the money in your account to keep growing at a rate that is equal to (or better yet faster) than the inflation rate. Otherwise, the money from interest would eventually be not enough to pay the bills. So additional money needs to be added into the bank account. This is no different from the debt. \n \n It is a scam just like school vouchers. Certain parties see taxes as a big pot of gold and they are trying to siphon money out of it.",
