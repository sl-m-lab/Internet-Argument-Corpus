Close to 6,000 were successfully traced -- and of those, 90 percent -- 5,114 to be exact, according to testimony in Congress by William Hoover -- were found to have come from the U.S.\n \n But in those same two years, according to the Mexican government, 29,000 guns were recovered at crime scenes.\n \n In other words, 68 percent of the guns that were recovered were never submitted for tracing. And when you weed out the roughly 6,000 guns that could not be traced from the remaining 32 percent, it means 83 percent of the guns found at crime scenes in Mexico could not be traced to the U.S.\n",

   "I can't help but wonder something about this whole issue. The president of Mexico claims to be serious about breaking the drug cartel and bringing peace and order to Mexico. And as we've seen the drug cartel is very powerful and has its fingers in many divisions, including the military, police and politicians on all levels.\n \n Now if the president is serious about his commitment against the drug cartel, and he's knows they're so damn dangerous, why exactly hasn't he ordered a full scale military deployment? Why hasn't he given the order to send out the troops armed with heavy machine guns, grenades missile launchers, tanks, strike vehicles, Black Hawk helicopters, gun ships and every other piece of hardware, for the express purpose of blowing the drug cartel out of existence? Why the resistance to wiping them off the face of the planet through overwhelming firepower and a complete lack of mercy? Call in a few airstrikes to carpet bomb the cartel hideouts. Deploy a squadron of UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters mounted with M134 miniguns, or GAU-19 gatling guns. If this is a war then treat it like one, deploy the heavy forces and have them do the job right.

Yeah Right!\n \n   Line Between Mexican Drug Cartels and the Government Increasingly Blurred \n One certain way for Godoy to dodge the charges hanging over him was to take his seat in Congress thus taking advantage of a Mexican blanket immunity law that dates to the late 19tj century and was originally intended to shield Mexican politicians from harassment by opponents and others while in office. Godoy's path to office was cleared by an allegedly cartel-corrupted judge in Michoac\u00e1n earlier this year. Very few high-profile criminals actually face prosecution and jail sentences in Mexico if they are \"well-connected\" like Godoy.\n \n .. Well, my real concern is that hundreds of millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars have poured into Mexico for the Mexican government to battle the very cartels of which Godoy is reputedly a member. This obvious incongruity should be a concern for the U.S. government from the White House on down to local U.S. border town officials. My question is - exactly how thoroughly tainted is Mexico's government with cartel drug money?\n \n Some $400 million of U.S. taxpayer's money has already made its way into Mexican governmental hands, and hundreds of millions more are in the pipeline. Is our taxpayer money being administrated by government officials whose big smiles, outstretched hands, expensive shoes and nice suits belie their duplicitous actions and cartel affiliations? Are we paying the very cartels we think we are assisting Mexico to eradicate? Who is auditing the way U.S. tax payer cash is being used by Mexico? Exactly whose pockets are our tax dollars are being tucked into, and is anybody checking?\n\n SCAM the Constitution! Scam away! \n \n Do you take drugs? I don't expect for anyone here to incriminate themselves. But if you do, just belly up to the bar for your complicity in those terrible deaths! \n \n The Problem is DRUGS and the best Bought and paid for police, military, judges, and government officials that the cartel's drug money can buy! Everyone who uses drugs is contributing the very money that pays for the Military Weapons and all of those bought and paid for Drug Cartel officials! \n \n Concentrate on the criminals! What you dearly hope to perpetrate on the Constitution in the name of fighting Mexican violence will do nothing and you know it! \n \n I'm tired of the LIE!",

Do you honestly expect anyone to believe that Mexico, with all of its corruption, finds it easier to deal with our laws and get out strictly regulated weapons out of our country and into theirs, rather than order old military stock from Colombia and Korea and China and have it imported with the latest drug shipment?\nStrictly regulated? You're joking, right. Maybe they will take any and all.\n \n \nWhat the hell difference does that make? Why are you so fanatically obsessed in finding a literal nobody that might or might not even officially exist? The justice system isn't going to do anything with him even if they do catch him, we know this. Gun traffickers are rarely ever punished for their crimes, they never get even close to the proper sentences the law demands.\nI guess we can just give up on trying to catch gun traffickers then, huh?\n \n \nThat's because you share the fantasy of every gun hater around.

   "They aren't any more than we are. It just isn't necessary in the US because guns are easily had by criminals.\n\n \n Missed your mark again. I'm asking what exactly is preventing the criminals in foreign nations from importing weapons from other countries, due to the lack of weapons back at home.\n \n \n69,000+ requests. I missed nothing. You think the Mexicans are asking the wrong people?\n\n \n Yep. Can't trace something that was never in the system to begin with. And any weapon from outside the country can't be traced.\n \n \nNo, different ones.\n\n \n Which different ones? Which authorities are you referring to, stationed in Mexico, that aren't in the drug cartel's pocket right now? We've seen all the stories about the reach of the cartel's corruption, how they own politicians and use violence against the government to get what they want. We've seen the stories about confiscated weapons going missing and ending up back in circulation. So which authorities are you referring to that are different from the ones that're being bought with drug money?\n \n \nAll the people?\n\n \n If they weapons confiscated were in truth found to be in the possession of the citizenry, yes.\n \n \nNot lifting a finger to reduce the access criminal to firearms either.\n\n \n Criminal access to firearms is zero. It can't be reduced any further. There's not a legal avenue for criminals to acquire firearms unless they further break the law, thus committing more crimes than they had previously.\n \n It's not our job to be fighting Mexico's fight for them. Why hasn't Calderon done anything to keep his country's criminals from crossing the border into our country? What exactly is he doing to help?\n \n \nThat number will probably not be released.\n\n \n Then you've got absolutely nothing and the fight is lost to you.\n \n \nWhat about those acquired on the secondary market? The ones anyone can buy without fear of the firearm ever being traced to them.\n\n \n What of them? Are you going to provide the requested information or are you going to refuse like a bad child?\n \n \nReason and logic suggests where there's smoke, there's fire.\n\n \n There's also smoke bombs and decoys where there's smoke. And you seem to be using them quite a bit in this quest of yours to paint a bad picture of this country and how we do things.\n \n \nI think you know my counterargument to your unregulated firearms market.\n\n \n Your entire counterargument amounts to \"you're wrong\" with no further explanation of how your opinion should be taken as truthful or accurate.\n \n \nMy experience is different I guess.\n\n \n Yeah. Forum trolling.\n \n \nI forego answering every nonsensical thing you say. Life's too short. I don't have a superiority complex, that's just your insecurity talking. For good reason.\n\n \n Nonsensical? I go into detail explaining exactly why a national database of secondary transfers would fail, and you call it nonsensical? I address points such as budget constraints, constitutional restrictions, legal hurdles, manpower limitations, and the realities of extensive paperwork requirements, and all you have to say in response is that it's nonsensical in nature? That's the best you've got?\n \n If life really is too short for you to make an effort to prove yourself right, then you really shouldn't be engaged in a debate you have no chance of winning. Time to fish or cut bait.\n \n \n\"Tom Mangan, a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives...\"\n\n \n Well as someone who actually owns a rifle with an adjustable stock I can speak with perfect certainty that you and Mangan, are talking nonsense. The notion that a person can fold the stock on a rifle, slip it under their coat, and perfectly conceal it without even the slightest of incriminating bulges appearing and alerting someone that something hinky is going on, is a Hollywood myth. As a matter of real world physics it's impossible. Anybody who's ever held an AK-47, AR-15 or other similar firearm knows that fact.\n \n \nIf there are no witnesses and no physical evidence then no successful prosecution is possible. Right?\n\n \n Your original statement was that if somebody isn't watching and observing, then the law doesn't apply/exist. That's quite a way's off from what you just said now; claiming that a crime exists but nothing can be done except let it go.\n \n Make up your mind.\n \n \nI heard that one before. How is CA handling it?\n\n \n Poorly! Your state has sunken an untold amount of taxpayer funding into a system that can't do anything to address guns being brought into the state from outside of California. You can't show the number of secondary sales that have been successfully documented, despite this evidence being available through the FOIA, or the number of prosecutions that have been made against those that have failed to go through a licensed dealer for a secondary sale. You can't even prove that your system is actually enforceable.\n \n Nothing that shows the benefit of your beloved system can be presented to support it. Otherwise you would have already.\n \n \nHow is the name of the initial buyer released to authorities through tracing now?\n\n \n A sale made by a federally licensed dealer to a private individual, isn't comparable to a transfer made between two private individuals. You don't seem to grasp the fact that the two are entirely different standards and aren't substitute goods.\n \n Despite what your state, the land of fruits and nuts, might say to the contrary, government can't require private individuals to follow the same guidelines as a federally licensed dealer and be held to the same standard of practice. Nor can they compel everybody exercising their constitutional rights to disclose private information to them.\n \n \nThe report takes no stand on civilian gun ownership in the US. You're making stuff up.\n\n \n I'd ask you for proof that your statement is accurate. But since you've refused every other time you've been asked to prove facts are accurate I'm getting tired of expecting honesty from you.\n \n \nThe fact is that a couple years ago the Mexican authorities had asked us to trace 11,000 weapons. Two years later, that number is approaching 70,000.\n\n \n Still not sufficient evidence that a significant percentage of those weapons have ties to America. All that says is that Mexico is admitting their country is awash in illegal weapons (despite their very clear and draconian laws) and they can't do a thing about it and they have no idea where they're all coming from.\n \n Calderon keeps asking us to help him. But he doesn't want us to do anything effective to combat his problem. Anytime somebody proposes something that would actually do some good, like closing the borders and keeping people from illegally entering the country, Calderon is condemning the notion and calling for an open border policy. He basically wants the border to remain open for his criminals, but closed to anything except money that might cross back over.",

Stephen Halbrook's 2009 article in the St. Thomas Law Review details the close connection between the disarmament of the German Jews and what came next. From the conclusion:\n \n Over a period of several weeks in October and November 1938, the Nazi government disarmed the German Jewish population. The process was carried out both by following a combination of legal forms enacted by the Weimar Republic and by sheer lawless violence. The Nazi hierarchy could now more comfortably deal with the Jewish question without fear of armed resistance by the victims.\n \n It may be tempting to argue that the possession of firearms by the German Jews would have made no difference, either in the 1938 pogrom or later in the Holocaust, when the majority were deported and then eradicated in death camps. Yet this fatalistic view ignores that the Nazis themselves viewed armed Jews as sufficiently dangerous to their policies to place great emphasis on the need to disarm all Jews. In 1938, it was by no means certain that Jewish armed resistance movements could not develop, and even less certain that individual Jews would not use arms to resist arrest, deportation, or attacks by the Nazis.\n ...\n Consistent adherents of a \"Never Again!\" policy - which assumes that what has happened in history, could again happen - would seek policies to help ensure that it does not indeed occur again.\n \n That brings us back to Alfred Flatow. [The article provides a case study of Flatow, a Jewish veteran of the German army, who competed for Germany in the 1896 Olympics.] What if he - and an unknown number of other Germans, Jews and non-Jews alike - had not registered his firearms in 1932? Or if the Weimar Republic had not decreed firearm registration at all? What if the Nazis, when they took power in 1933 and disarmed social democrats and other political enemies, or when they decided to repress the entire Jewish population in 1938, did not have police records of registered firearm owners? Can it be said with certainty that no one, either individually or in groups small or large, would have resisted Nazi depredations?\n \n One wonders what thoughts may have occurred to Alfred Flatow in 1942 when he was dying of starvation at the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Perhaps memories of the 1896 Olympics and of a better Germany flashed before his eyes. Did he have second thoughts, maybe repeated many times before, on whether he should have registered his revolver and two pocket pistols in 1932 as decreed by the Weimar Republic? Or whether he should have obediently surrendered them at a Berlin police station in 1938 as ordered by Nazi decree, only to be taken into Gestapo custody? We will never know, but it is difficult to imagine that he had no regrets.\n \n \n \n \n\n \n Still you stand opposed to the Constitutional rights of a free people and their G-d given and recognized civil rights. This is your legacy...and the regard with which you are held!:xcensored",

   "\"Regarding the gun violence debate: gentlemen, it's a very complicated landscape. And one that keeps altering with time. It's not your grandfather's NRA anymore, nor is it your grandfather's Brady Campaign. \n \n Regarding the latter group & their supporters, no current \"mainstream\" gun control group supports a ban on any type of weapon, except the assault-type. True, up until recently, there was an interest among a few of them to ban, or seriously regulate, the ownership of handguns. But the general gun control lobby realizes that a handgun ban is unrealisitic. And after the recent Heller & McDonald decisions, such a ban would also be unconstitutional. SO IT JUST AIN\"T HAPPENIN'.\n \n And I've dealt enough with Brady, et al, to know that the gun grabbers within their ranks are few, basically powerless, and just about alientated within these organizations. True, that may have not been the case a few decades ago, but it is now.\n \n I personally don't support a ban on any type of firearm, but do strongly support NATIONAL near-universal background checks, mandated safe storage and mandated lost & stolen gun reporting. And I'd like to see better funding for the BATFE and more freedom for LE to pass gun info amongst themselves. These are all essentially left-leaning gun control initiatives. If such laws are tightly written, funded & enforced, they would drop gun violence significantly over time.\n \n But the right-leaning approach to gun violence would also pay big dividends. It largely focuses on mending a penal system that's presently ineffective (with all the plea-bargaining that goes on, among other things). As we all know, gun offenses are among the ones often bargained away. Also, many violent persons zip through the system's \"revolving door\", ending up on the outside prematurely to commit more mayhem. \n \n A sound anti-gun violence policy should address both approaches, left & right. It would be entirely constitutional and effective. \n \n The trouble is getting the federal government to do something. In the end, it's not a job for state or local governments. They can enact such measures and perhaps reap a small benefit. And, if enough of them do so, they may get the fed to react since many local or state initiatives can go national.

This includes silencers intended for air rifles as they will work just fine on a real firearm, even if for only one shot. The only way to make a silencer in the USA without a license or paying the $200 tax is to make it integral to a non-firearm, like an air rifle. If the silencer has to be destroyed (or cut off with a saw) to be removed from the air rifle, then it is legally not a firearm silencer.\n \n Ranb",

I was curious to know how something that was attatched and rather flimsy looking compared to the actual barrel of a rifle with chamber pressures of 50,000 cup could/would fare and survive. I once had a compensator that was not a silencer but designed to reduce muzzle climb on a .45 target pistol that was extremely sturdy built. Shooting cast or swaged bullets seemed to fill up the grooves at the bottom rather quickly and was a real chore to remove easily after 180 rounds per match. I began to believe it affected the accuracy and finally quit using it although it did work to reduce muzzle climb and reduce bounce. I don't know quite how 'silencers' are constructed but have talked to a few that do use them and seen video that proves their effectiveness to reduce noise. Since they are legal in most States with the \"tax\" which is probably going to be found unConstitutional since a great many were ex post facto and now that firearms are a fundamental right I have to wonder if it is your day job that keeps you tied to the State you currently reside in?\n Seems to me that your career choice would be full of opportunities in a reasonable State?...that would also be much more acceptable to your hobbies?

   "The Purpose.\n   Icebreaker' Clears Way for Gun Control Efforts \n The House of Delegates reaffirmed its support for the Brady bill, which requires a 5-day interval between purchase and pickup of a handgun, and called for restrictions on the sale of assault weapons. \n \n These were just a few steps in the growing national momentum for gun control efforts. The Brady bill signed into law at the end of November is, in the view of antigun lobbyists, just the beginning of increased pressure for gun control laws. \n \n \"We intend to push for some very aggressive gun control legislation,\" says Richard Aborn, president of Handgun Control Inc, one of the more assertive gun control lobbying groups in the nation's capital.\n \n The Result.\n  \n  Brady Bill has not reduced murder rates \n WASHINGTON - The Brady Bill, that darling of gun controllers for so many years, turns out to be a fraud and a delusion. \n \n Forcing gun buyers to submit to background checks and five-day waiting periods doesn't reduce murder and manslaughter one bit. Those are the findings of Jens Ludwig and Phillip Cook of the National Consortium on Violence Research, as reported in the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association. \n \n The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act launched a thousand liberal tirades and hundreds of hand-wringing editorials, but it was all hot air.\n\n How did the CDC and The National Academy of Sciences put it? Oh yeah! The Exact Same results! \n \n In 2000 to 2002 The CDC conducted a systematic review of scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of firearms laws in preventing violence, including violent crimes, suicide, and unintentional injury. The systematic review development team identified 51 studies that evaluated the effects of selected firearms laws on violence and met the inclusion criteria for this review. No study was excluded because of limitations in design or execution.\n \n  What did they find?  \n \"the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.\" \n\n The CDC did suggest more studies. Then a few years later the CDC got a second bite at the apple with The National Academy of Sciences studies. They, along with the Anti-gun Joyce foundation funded, the study. Data on Firearms and Violence Too Weak to Settle Policy Debates; Comprehensive Research Effort Needed\n \n Here is an article about the study Link  who issued a 328-page report based on 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study. \nIn short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns. \n\n \n Sinjin. You are NOT entitled to all of the gun control you want! This is a Constitutionally protected Right from YOU and the Government! \n \n When dealing with a Constitutional Right, laws are supposed to be few in number, specifically targeted, and specifically written to deal with the threat to society. \n \n Gun laws are not few in number.   The \"Unregulated\" Gun  \n \"Gun Laws of America is 384 pages of just the federal statutes that regulate guns-more than 88,000 words. Additionally, the associated federal regulations interpreting these laws are even larger. Minimum penalty for a violation is typically 5 years in federal prison for every offense.\n \n It is estimated that there are between 22,000 and 30,000 gun laws on the books in America. Those laws include restrictions on possession, carry, distribution, storage, transfer, manufacture, sale, ownership, importation, use and more. \n\n \n And you got all of this in the gun Hating Clinton Administration!\n 1.Brady background checks for all handgun buyers, \n 2.institution of the waiting period,\n 3. Making it illegal for anyone under 18 to own or even possess a handgun.\n 4. The President's executive order stopping the importation of many guns,\n 5. Excessive fees and regulations that drove many legitimate gun shop owners out of business.\n 6. The widening of Brady to include background checks from just handguns to include all new firearm purchases. \n 7. Insta Check! \n 8. Additional disqualification's and changes to legal firearms purchases on form 4473, \n 9. The assault weapons ban. sunset\n 10.

(snip)\n For example, restrictive gun laws in California is the largest source of guns traced to out-of-state sources by agencies in Oregon, Nevada and Arizona.\n Finally, guns sold in the 10 states that MAIG says are most responsible for interstate gun trafficking, are actually only one-third as likely to end up being traced from other States.\n\n \n Your STRAWMAN makes for good propaganda for the press though!",

   "When you buy a new gun from a FFL, with a NICS background check, does the personal info you mention above end up in a national database?\n\n \n All the sales records stored at the gun stores, the 4473 forms -the ones that list the name, social security number, race, state, city, address and signature of the buyer, along with the make, model and serial number of the purchase- the ones that list everything short of fingerprints and photographs, which amounts to sufficient information to fulfill registration requirements implemented by various states and cities, constitute a national database. Not a very good one, but a database nonetheless. For as long as these records exist, the federal government knows who bought what and where they live.\n \n That's a database. That's a registry. It's that simple. If you can't see that then it's a fault on your end, not on my end.\n \n \nWhy would it need to be so if we were to cover secondary sales with the existing system?\n\n \n Because the currently existing system wasn't designed for the massive influx of secondary sales that the government has no authority to regulate in the same manner as primary sales.\n \n \n\"NICS is a national name check system that queries available records in the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), the Interstate Index (III), and the NICS Index to determine if prospective purchasers are disqualified from receiving firearms. NICS provides federal firearms licensees with an immediate determination as to whether the transfer of a firearm may proceed or if more research is required to determine whether the transfer would violate federal or state law.\n \n Pursuant to a final rule published on July 20, 2004, the NICS must destroy identifying information by or on behalf of any person who has been determined not to be prohibited from receiving a firearm no more than twenty four (24) hours after the system advises a federal firearms licensee that the transfer would not violate the Brady Act. [3] Accordingly, NICS must destroy all identifying information on allowed transactions prior to the start of the next business day.\"\n Federal Bureau of Investigation - Freedom of Information - Privacy Impact Assessment\n\n \n Federal licensees. Not private individuals who are not engaged in the business of firearm transaction, and thus not bound by government mandate to follow government procedure for the purpose of handling their own private possessions.\n \n Regardless of whether or not NICS is required to destroy all records after 24 hours is irrelevant, as the Form 4473 records remain indefinitely and can be searched at any time for any reason by anyone who works for the government.\n \n I'd also like to see some proof that NICS is actually following through and complying with guidelines that require the destruction of records, rather than thumbing their noses at the authorities and maintaining their own illegal database. Where are the audits? Where's the transparency that we were promised?\n \n \nBtw my state is addressing the loophole by requiring NICS for all sales.\n\n \n You yourself has admitted that the system can't do anything to address the fact that your state is big on illegally importing firearms from out of state, which can't be traced. Your state is one of the reasons that firearms trafficking is such a lucrative business by supplying sufficient demand for the goods that somebody will actually deliver. You admitted it, for every gun trafficked out of the state at least two are trafficked in.\n \n You've admitted that California's system is completely useless for when it comes to out of state sales. The police have absolutely no way of telling who is in possession of an illegal and unregistered firearm, and there's not a law that California can pass to do a thing about it. All you can do is throw your hands up in the air and admit your defeat, and moan like a little ***** about how the rest of the nation hasn't followed your inane standard of distrust and suspicion. The rest of the country isn't going to come to your aid this time, and if you can't stand on your own two feet with your own system then you should do away with it.\n \n \nSince I've never advocated a \"national secondary sales registry\"\n\n \n Yes you have, don't lie to us. Simply because you don't understand what you say, that's not our fault. It's your own fault if you don't have the comprehension skills necessary to understand the implications of what you support and would like to see implemented without review or discussion.\n \n I've explained why your idea of recording secondary sales would fail miserably. I've gone into detail on just why your proposal would never do any good. Your only response has been in the form of an \"You don't know what you're talking about, it'd all work out just fine\" attitude that plays fast and loose with the truth and disregards current facts in favor of pure policy. You couldn't even defend your own position, making it highly questionable just how much you believe it'd be a good idea.\n \n Your suggestion that we have a nationwide system in place to record all secondary sales and hold private citizens to the same requirements as licensed business holders, would never pass the strict scrutiny test. You'd never be able to enforce your desired system, and in the end all we'd do is waste who know how much funding that we don't even have to begin with.",

I have already told you at least 60 times I am satisfied to wait and see what the Supreme Court decides!

I'm all for implementing some new regulations and doing away with others if that's feasible. \n\n You have asked repeatedly for more and more. Besides the one failed law you are pushing now, their is all that this statement entails! \n \n Yes, I support rigorous protocols for sales, storage and timely theft reporting. \n\n \n \nAnd answer the question I posed, if you please.\n\n NOPE! Your endless request for more and more gun control is not justified. No one has been even able to prove the value of what Infringements we have already given you on violent outcomes! I am not for any more restrictions on the 2nd Amendment to our Great and unique Constitution. Unlike you, I am solidly within the majority of the gallop poll! The greatest document of personal liberties even penned! \n \n Perhaps we should be looking at this in another way! How about you anti-2nd Amendment folks start justifying all of the restrictions that you already have? < http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/14712-us-firearms-mexico-6.html#post418095\n \n Heller and McDonald told you this is Our/My Right! The 2nd Amendment is supposed to protect Our/My Right from people like you who will incessantly try to continually, Piggishly I might add, take everything you can get!   The Preamble to the Bill of Rights says. \nTHE Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution\n\n The restrictive clauses is restrictive against government/you! As President Obama correctly says, the Bill of Rights is a list of negative Rights against government! You simply are in the wrong in your endless asking for us to continually give up more to satisfy your HATE for one of our Bill of Rights! And you seem to need to be constantly told that!\n \n You constantly use the dodge of arguing process, to try and take the Sting out of the loss of our Rights! Foolishly I might add!\n   The Second Amendment strikes back  \n Even some noted liberal professors admit the obvious. Harvard's Laurence Tribe says, \"The Fourteenth Amendment, which makes parts of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states, reflected a broad agreement that bearing arms was a 'privilege' of each citizen.\" Fellow Harvard liberal law professor Alan Dershowitz agrees, and scolds fellow liberals for twisting the words of the Second Amendment in a way that could come back to haunt them. \"Foolish liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by claiming that it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a safety hazard,\" said Dershowitz, \"don't see the danger of the big picture.\" He added, \"They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like.\" \n",
