Just like God did. All you need is a little bit of faith, and as Jesus said, you could move a mountain. Why you could (magically) make your debt dissappear.

   "I get you however there are different levels of betrayal.\n For example, the betrayal of Judas as desribed would be drastically different that that of Peter.\n It sould not be compulsary to lay down your life for a friend even if the bible praises that as a noble gesture.

And while one is called to love neighbors and you do yourself and to love your God with all your heart, you aren't required to die to prove it.\nNo one is saying it is required you die to prove it.

Judas did not.\n \n \nAs for the mustard seed.\n Analogy meaning 'very little amount' with the use of a mustard seed comparison...however, many people have expressed abundant faith giving their lives and all they have to back that up and be persecuted...and nothing earth shaking ever happened.\nWhich shows you how little faith they really had.

   "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n I don't think he is at all funny to watch! This may be a bit of a stretch.. But it makes my point. I am sure that in the beginning, all tyrants were funny to watch to by some. However, in time the \"funny\" changed to fear. In fact, Hitler was thought be a nut by a good many Germans in his early days! I am not saying that Hagee is another Hitler. Nonetheless, this nut has a congregation of 19,000 + \"god\" knows how many people watch him on TV and believe his words.... SCARY!!!!!:angry:\n\n \n \n Dr. John C. Hagee is the founder and Senior Pastor of Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, a non-denominational evangelical church with more than 18,000 active members.\n \n Dr. Hagee is the President and C.E.O. of John Hagee Ministries which telecasts his national radio and television ministry carried in America on 160 T.V. stations, 50 radio stations, eight networks and can be seen weekly in 99 million homes. John Hagee Ministries is in Canada on the Miracle Channel and CTS, and can be seen in Africa, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and is in most Third World nations.\n \n He goes by Dr. because he has an Honorary Doctorate from Oral Roberts University. Are they accredited by anyone?",

Even some like pres. Bushy who may try to use it as a template for foreign policy.\n What do I mean try? DOES! DOES!.\n \n And...if I wasn't really evil at heart...I may have some issues with that.\n \n \nHe goes by Dr. because he has an Honorary Doctorate from Oral Roberts University. Are they accredited by anyone?\n\n \n In the 'biz of religion', to some it means a lot. My eldest daughter (now 17) had been planning on going there for college.\n Until something wonderful happened.\n She found Atheism!\n \n Nothing like hearing my \"I'm radical for the Lord and the bible says I must (lie about you to) hate you.\" all of a sudden, do a 180 and Spew some of the most creative 'F**k God' comments I've ever heard.\n Now, I think she sticks to the 'must hate dad' due to ritual and immaturity and inability to say you were right, I was wrong. Couple with her narcissistic mother's (also a new atheistic person) inability to admit wrong and here we are.\n At least, deep down inside...I know I'm vindicated.\n \n As for accreditation. I'm really not sure. I would say they aren't. It's been a couple of years since I checked and I really don't remember.\n \n I do know it's quite popular for honorary doctorates to be handed out (or bought) in the religion field.\n I also know the pastors in this subgenre do like to abuse the honorary part and never inform anyone that they didn't earn it. Thus, trying to protray an air of education where none exists.\n \n I was even going to comment on this phenomena a couple of days back...but, as most know...I'm long winded enough as it is. ;)\n \n But, suffice to say, many evangelicals who have doctorates either got them from an internet degree mill college or were granted one from a place like Oral Roberts as an honorary degree (after donations). That'd account for about 50% IMO. Another 25% got them from bottom of the barrel places like RHEMA. And the remainder got them from normal seminaries and colleges.",
