   "After responding to a clever title to another article posted along similar lines, it prompted me to pose the question without semantics [as it were]. I guess when you look back at the social movements of the 60's which gave rise to many of the liberal ideals shaping the minds of today's youth, pertaining to the question of the validity of an argument that declares a woman has a certain amount of privacy with respect to her body and thus the stare decisis decision that gave us the ruling legalizing abortion-on-demand today.\n \n My question would be if women had the right to the privacy they claim fundamentally - If a woman has \"the right to survive pregancy\" - Where were the abortion advocates in at Plymouth rock? Where were the pro-choice voices in the streets of colonial Philadelphia? Where were these lifestyle proponents during the great \"enlightenment\" or the 1800's, 1900's even up to the 1940's - you didn't hear them as stridently although there was Margaret Sanger in the 20's, but she was touting eugenics not abortion-on-demand. Where were these voices? I guess [truth be told] you cannot guarantee what you cannot guarantee. No one can personally guarantee 100% mortality... life is life, and sometimes it isn't fair. So what do we do, pronounce a \"fairness doctrine\" on the unborn? Nonsense... people need to be aware of their behavior first, that's the missing puzzle piece. But it wasn't until the voice of social upheaval providing the environment for lawlessness to prevade the minds of those making these arguments that we had any arguments made at all. When they did come, it came on two fronts, promoting the ideology and practice strictly out of convenience.\n \n Supported by the radical environmentalist who believes man is the problem and stood for depopulation, and of course the feminist who packaged abortion into a perceived civil liberty that no \"man\" had any right to even be considered into any phase because it was her body. Abortion was sold to American, because it had no chance at any other time - therefore, it took an element of lawlessness in the air to even get it off the ground. Apparently I am not the only one who has made this observation. The question should be asked... how does a woman have a 100% right over another life in the making when she did not exercise 100% rational judgement when she freely engaged int he beahior that bought on the conception. Her responsibility was to protect herself - if she negated it, how does it become a state responsibility to negate the laws of consequences and let her out of a perceived right to privacy carry out what can be called nothing less that state sponsored genocide? That is the question that needs to me addressed in the minds of those who see this for what it is, but makes us ever more weary of when the left comes calling about what they want right now... America always pays for it later.\n \n \n -That Darn Republican",

   "Abortion in colonial America:\n \nContrary to popularly held beliefs, abortion is not historically steeped in illegality. In colonial America there were actually no written laws banning abortion. It was rather loosely controlled by common law (unwritten laws handed down over generations). Abortion was permitted so long as it was done before quickening occurred. Quickening referred to that point in time when a woman could feel movement of the fetus (usually around the fifth month).\n\n Book Review - The Angel of Ashland: Practicing Compassion and Tempting Fate, by Vincent J. Genovese\n \n Also, it might be noted:\n \nAbortion was frequently practiced in North America during the period from 1600 to 1900. Many tribal societies knew how to induce abortions. They used a variety of methods including the use of black root and cedar root as abortifacient agents. During the colonial period, the legality of abortion varied from colony to colony and reflected the attitude of the European country which controlled the specific colony. In the British colonies abortions were legal if they were performed prior to quickening. In the French colonies abortions were frequently performed despite the fact that they were considered to be illegal. In the Spanish and Portuguese colonies abortion was illegal. From 1776 until the mid-1800s abortion was viewed as socially unacceptable; however, abortions were not illegal in most states. During the 1860s a number of states passed anti-abortion laws. Most of these laws were ambiguous and difficult to enforce. After 1860 stronger anti-abortion laws were passed and these laws were more vigorously enforced. As a result, many women began to utilize illegal underground abortion services. Although abortion was legalized in 1970, many women are still forced to obtain illegal abortion or to perform self-abortions due to the economic constraints imposed by the Hyde Amendment and the unavailability of services in many areas. Throughout the colonial period and during the early years of the republic, the abortion situation for slave women was different than for other women. Slaves were subject to the rules of their owners, and the owners refused to allow their slaves to terminate pregnancies. The owners wanted their slaves to produce as many children as possible since these children belonged to the slave owners. This situation persisted until the end of the slavery era.\n\n Abortion in early America. [Women Health. 1979] - PubMed Result\n \n It is interesting to note that slaves were not permitted abortion because they were chattel, property, and the more they bred the richer their owners might become.\n \n So, by many patriarchal religious groups, women are still considered chattel, breeding stock.",

   "Another opinion", 
   "The idea of ensoulment was important in early views of abortion. From Ensoulment - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia :\n \nIn the Roman Catholic Church since the Middle Ages, ecclesiastical penalties for abortion have differed based on varying opinions of ensoulment. St. Augustine made a distinction between a fetus with a rational soul (fetus animatus) and one without (fetus inanimatus), and said that a human soul cannot exist in an animal or unformed body. Writing about Exodus 21 (c. 415), he said:\n \n \"The law does not provide that the act [of abortion] pertains to homicide, for there cannot be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation, if it is not yet formed in flesh and so not yet endowed with senses.\"\n \n This stood as the Christian position for over 1000 years, being incorporated into the Decretum Gratiani.[4][5] Around 1211, Innocent III, when asked if a monk was guilty of murder for helping his lover get an abortion, stated that the soul enters the body of the fetus at the time of quickening (when the mother first felt movement of the fetus), and that abortion before quickening was not murder. St. Thomas Aquinas, Doctor of the Church, wrote in the 1200s that a developing human embryo has first a vegetative and then a sensitive, or animal soul, before dissolving and being replaced by an intellective, or human soul:\n \n \"Therefore it must be said that the intellective soul is created by God at the completion of man's coming-into-being. This soul is at one and the same time both a sensitive and nutritive life-principle, the preceding forms having been dissolved\"[6][7]\n \n The 1311 Council of Vienne officially confirmed the view of Thomas Aquinas.[8]\n \n In 1588, Pope Sixtus V issued the first Papal Bull (Effraenatam) which subjected those that carried out abortions at any stage of gestation with excommunication and punishment by civil authorities.[9] In 1591, Gregory XIV modified the law so that the penalty did not apply until the fetus became animated.[10][11]\n \n In 1679, Pope Innocent XI publicly condemned sixty-five propositions as \"at least scandalous and in practice dangerous\", including:\n 34. It is lawful to procure abortion before ensoulment of the fetus lest a girl, detected as pregnant, be killed or defamed.\n \n 35. It seems probable that the fetus (as long as it is in the uterus) lacks a rational soul and begins to first have one when it is born; and consequently it must be said that no abortion is homicide.[12]\n In 1869, Pius IX rescinded Gregory's animated fetus exception in the Bull Apostolicae Sedis, and re-enacted the penalty of excommunication for abortions at any stage of pregnancy.[13][14] The distinction between animated and unanimated fetus remained in canon law until the second codification in 1917.\n\n This means that, through most of Christian history, there was a differentiation made between a fetus prior to quickening / animation and a fetus after that. This is phrased in different ways - the differentiation between a rational soul and an irrational soul, or that the fetus first has a vegetative and then an animal soul and then finally an intellectual soul. All of these Church doctrines - up to the late 19th century - recognized exactly the type of differentiations that we, on the pro-choice side, are making. Namely, they and we both differentiate between the level of mental existence of the fetus early on vs later in pregnancy. The main differences are that, in the modern day, we ascribe mental existence to the development of the brain and the Church ascribes it to the soul. Also, the Church fathers understood the entering of an animated / rational soul as happening at quickening - something that would have made sense at the time since they would have had no understanding of reflex actions causing movement. Either way, both pro-choice side and Christianity through most of its history viewed abortion very differently depending on its state of mental development (be it from brain or soul arguements) - ascribing legal limits or limits defined by excommunication depending on the development.\n \n Simone is correct in her historical summary. The US government continued the legal views on abortion inherited from British common law - that allowed abortion if performed prior to quickening. Of course, people knew that pregnancy started prior to quickening. They simply understood that there were inherent differences between prior stages and later stages.",

If abortion is outlawed, just what will the sanction be and against whom will it be applied for the \"crime\" of abortion\n\n \n The doctor should be fined and ultimately loose him license, and they need to create a category of manslaughter because it was premeditated but because the child wasn't born, we should refrain from calling it murder but 1st. degree manslaughter on a pre-infant would work. Strong laws with stiff punishments always deter vice to a controllable degree.\n \n \n \n3. what methods will be employed to enforce the law\n\n \n See above, when doctor's loose their licenses, the immediate availability of the procedure would dry up. \n \n \n \n4. what the dollar cost will be to enforce the law.\n\n \n \n Whatever the cost, it can't be more than what we're paying now... \n \n \n \nCome on, you theorists, let's have some answers to real boots on the ground questions.\n\n \n \"theorists?... really, you feel that you have that much of a standing? Roe v. Wade is a heartbeat from being repealled.",

First off... scripture dates back over 4000 years so you got that wrong right off, secondly I submit to what is plainly in front of me... they call that rational and reasonable. Unlike those who engage in an irrational war against something that had nothing but their best interests in... but because it charges one to form up their behavior to an obvious standard... well, that just proves too much for some.
