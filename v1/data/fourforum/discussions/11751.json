This is the silliest thing I have ever heard. How in the heck have these \"resources\" you speak of been reallocated? The problem has been that people demanded houses, the government gave (freddie and fannie when they shouldn't have) then when they couldn't pay their mortgages, they bailed out, wiped their hands, clean, etc and left these companies in negative. They went broke due to bad decision making, bad loans to people who couldn't pay, etc. Thousands lost their jobs, 401k's etc, now these same people blame the government and these companies for their stupidity. Also, I'll let you in something, Bush didn't make these policies, the Carter Administration did and was enlarged by the Clinton administration. When Bush tried to get congress to regulate, the Democrats blocked legislation saying it would hurt \"poor people.\" Sorry my friend, these people wouldn't pay dime even you nullified these changes. BTW, those resources are still there, just now they have more requirements just like they should have.",

Their jobs were outsourced from under them and people who had worked faithfully for years and years were suddenly jobless, without health insurance, having to subsist by running up their credit cards.\nNo, and you have no evidence to back this up. It wasn't like 1yr ago all the jobs went overseas and everyone lost their home. The foreclosures were from mortgages made over the last 5+ years that were made to people who really couldn't afford them come time for the rates to adjust. Interest rates adjust to reflect the risk of the investment since, after all, someone is investing money in the short term to fund the long term debt (mortgages). Once the interest rates got too high or people stopped investing in the short term you saw people forced to default on mortgages they really couldn't afford in the first place. Daewoo gave some great examples of people who had no steady income getting a loan and then down the road complaining about not having the money to pay for it.\n \n You can't blame outsourcing as their is zero evidence to support this claim.\n \n \nAlso, the criminally-inclined credit industry bears a major responsibility for this current mess by extending credit to everyone without checking to see if they can pay.\nTheir responsibility is to go bankrupt for screwing up and issuing the loans. On the other hand the person who got the loan should lose the house because they never were able to afford it to begin with. Not a one-sided fault...these people knew what kind of loans they were getting into.\n \n \nThe intent of the credit industry was to enrich itself though higher interest rates and default penalties rather than simply gathering payments for principle and a lower rate of interest.\nYou clearly don't understand how mortgages work. Many mortgages are backed by short term notes. If people don't re-invest in the short term notes than the money dries up and foreclosures will happen (a few steps later). Now what makes you think a mortgage company wants to not collect payments on a house? Do you honestly think they like going bankrupt and not having any money? Higher interest rates didn't help them. Beyond that, it wasn't just the mortgages that made these companies fail. You can have types of derivative investments which can fail when the market goes south. These make up most of the bad debt covered in the bailout from what I understand. Our government has provided a nice site for the beginners such as yourself.\n \n \nUnprincipled blackguards! Thieves!
