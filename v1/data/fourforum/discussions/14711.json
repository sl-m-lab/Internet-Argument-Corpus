   "\"Rupert Joy should be deeply ashamed of hisself,\" the former UK ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, said when he learned about Joy's participation in the style.uz fashion week, organized by Uzbek President Karimov's daughter Gulnara.\n Having enslaved their country to ensure stratospheric profits for themselves, the Uzbek elite and Karimova, in particular, cannot but be concerned with their image in the world which they are trying to improve by splashing huge money by others on this.\n Craig Murray is convinced that Karimova wants to improve her image to strengthen her political ambitions. One of their means of doing this to involve ambassadors of countries that enjoy a good reputation in the world in her events. \n I think this accident proved that some ambassador has got second wages by Karimov's dictatorship regime. It could be realized by some tax exemption for some structures belong to politicians and other. There are a lot of schemes for it, you know. Joy boost Uzbekistan's image of respectability even though it is one of the world's worst dictatorship!",
