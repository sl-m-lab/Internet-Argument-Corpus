   "God has removed his 'magic hedge of protection*' from the Word of Faith New Life Church in CO. (cf Ted Haggard) allowing Satan to wrech havok in the form of an armed and murderous gunman who killed and injured several\n \n This shooting appears linked to an earlier shooting in Arvada CO. where a gunman killed 2 and injured 2 at a Missionary Training Center where youth are taught how to be a good Christian. The gunman was said to have been rejected by those there when he asked for shelter for the night.\n ' \"What so ever you do (or fail to do) to the least of my brethern you do unto me\"...and I will repay with a mighty vengence' seems to be the case of this incident in God's divine plan.\n \n *God had a hedge of protection around Job 'Job 1:10-12; 2:6'. Satan had to ask Jesus's permission to sift Peter like wheat 'Luke 22:31'. Without God's say so, Satan can do nothing! \n \n I wonder who at New Life 'spoke words of death' and with the power of the tongue brought this tragedy.\n Must have been someone laughing at a Christmas event and proclaiming 'you kill me.' recently.\n \n Yes, as insane as some of these beliefs are...they are touted by WofFers often. Word (your Word, not the WORD associated with God) and Faith (treated as a magic power used to create things...like God did, also knowns as the 'god kind of faith). \n In this event, believers were somehow demonically attacked (ALL bad things are demonically inspired). \n I wonder how the pastors will seek to back track their doctrines in the face of these events.\n I KNOW, they'll blame the dead and wounded!\n Which is exactly what they always do.\n \n As for me, in an ironic twist, I was a witness to this shooting just yesterday as I returned library books with my son.\n Fortunatly my magical powers and protections were intact as I slammed my car into reverse, had my son duck down and got the hell out of dodge, avoiding all random bullets in the area. Skills I learned in bad-guy training school.\n \n As a non-believer, I must say, my life has been quite blessed considering what I've encountered. Every hardship to date, I've come out smelling like roses (not that I really know what they smell like).",

   "So in your typically convoluted way of thinking, because something bad happened to those people, then those specific people did something to deserve being shot and killed like rabid animals? Why am I not surprised this is coming from you. \n \n I mean, on the one hand you say this: \n [Zardoz]God has removed his 'magic hedge of protection*' from the Word of Faith New Life Church in CO. (cf Ted Haggard) allowing Satan to wrech havok in the form of an armed and murderous gunman who killed and injured several\n And on the other hand you admit this:\n [Zardoz]As a non-believer, I must say, my life has been quite blessed considering what I've encountered. Every hardship to date, I've come out smelling like roses (not that I really know what they smell like).\n This is why I say convoluted thinking, because you seem to be implying that God is handing those who love and follow Him over to satan while leaving you, an unbeliever alone to go through life unscathed. \n \n Let me give you another perspective Zardoz. As the bible say's, we are ALL in a spiritual battle here on Earth. And satan, the god of this World wants to destroy all of humanity. But why should he go around attacking the spiritually dead? By that I mean you, the unbelievers. He already has you defeated after all. But the believers in Christ, even though he can't defeat them by claiming their souls, he can destroy their lives here and thereby their future work for God as he wipes out their lives.\n \n The only question that matters is why God allowed this to happen as surely He could have prevented it. I obviously don't know that answer but I do know that \"ALL things work out for Gods Glory to those who believe\". So I don't know how God will be glorified through this tragedy, but I know that He most assuredly will be.",

   "Just showing Arch that reality is 100% incompatable with WofF theology...and pretty much with Christian beliefs also. \n \n You seem to think statement A about God's protection is related to statement B about my personal experiences. \n Such is not the case unless YOU want to believe it.\n A is what WofFers believe to be the 100% truth. B is the reality of my situation. My 'experiences' have repeatedly proven WofF theology to be untrue.\n \n This type of BAD thing that happened, is said by the very victims it happened to to ONLY happen to sinners and those whom God has removed His protections from and, by your own fault, come to happen.\n It's the convoluted thinking and beliefs of Word of Faith.\n Whom are semi-related to Christian Scientist and New Agers in their beliefs.\n WofF accounts for the majority of charismatic/ pentecostalism believers on earth. They have THE largest church in the world (south korea). Are called a prosperity cult. Are the ones you see preaching on the air waves on TBN and other 'religious' channels. If it's a mega church, you can bet money that it's either WofF or closely associated with their beliefs.\n Even you have been co-opted to some WofF beliefs.\n \n When I comment on 'God kind of faith', it's their belief based on misinterpreting the bible.\n When the bible says 'have faith in God', the WofF's (using poor understanding of the original Greek) translate it to mean 'have faith OF God'.\n Using this, they believe God used his magic faith powers from his 'planet' to create the Earth. Adam had these same powers of creation also and Jesus said we could too...if we possessed even a small bit of faith (the size of a mustard seed) we could even move mountains with our verbal commands. WOW!\n \n It's really a fascinating, if entirely destructive, practice that has caught on like wildfire. Think of it as a sort of off-shoot of pentecostalism as they mostly embrace their practices...laying on of hands (that if it doesn't work, is your own fault and not the fault of the anointed healer) babbling like a fool in 'tongues'. Being slain in the spirit. Being drunk in the spirit. Interesting how they take scripture out of context to support their beliefs.\n How about a double portion of honor (money) for the pastor who should be treated like a king. \n \n As for your lesson from the bible...\n I counter with the bible that states anyone born again won't sin. \n 1 John 5:18 and 1 John 3:9\n We know that anyone born of God [b]does not continue to sin[/i]; the one who was born of God keeps him safe, and the evil one cannot harm him.\n \n Which also has passages WofFers use to support their prosperity claims (15And if we know that he hears us-whatever we ask-we know that we have what we asked of him.)\n \n \n In the end, what I'm stating is the bible says God offers protections to his people and will rescind that protection to allow satan to attack people, for what ever reason...or in Job's case, lack of reason, that pleases God.\n Of course, the bible also contradicts this belief by saying His followers would be persecuted and experience hardships*. Silly bible...full of contradictions.\n *something WofF pastors overlook unless the bad things are happening to THEMSELVES.\n \n As for your beliefs that Satan would attack a 'spiritually dead' person...what, I'm BLESSED...and according to the bible ALL blessings come from God.\n Satan can't bless me...that's a 'house divided against itself'.\n And all hardships come from teh devil!\n And the devil can do NOTHING without God's permission as I amply described using the Word. \n So, if you sin...you aren't saved.\n If you're being 'attacked', it's because God wants it to be so. \n \n As in the other thread, you can whine all you like about this but that's what the bible says.",

   "As I stated, I was just witness to a shooting not 50 feet from me roughly during the time of these events.\n I am an AVID gun supporter...I simply choose to get the hell out of the area ASAP.\n \n What I'm doing here is pointing out the failings of these 'Christians' in belief and deed.\n \n The 'Christians' at the missionary training center FAILED in their duty to assist a man who is stated to have ASKED for assistance.\n Matthew 25:35-46 CLEARLY illustrates that these sinners have failed their FINAL test and have gone away to eternal punishment.\n (\"...when I was a stranger, you invited me in...\")*\n \n And let's not forget that the bible commands followers to give a robe when a cloke is stolen and to go a 2nd mile when forced to go one.\n And lets not neglect the commandments to love they neighbor and that Love includes laying ones life down. I guess some can shout out about being a martyr but, when such an event could happen...it much more preferable to make the other guy one.\n \n As to the mega church's armed members.\n What a place to have a gun. \n In a church.\n And this was not a hired security guard to protect the building and property when the facility is shut down but an armed member of their in-house securiy staff.\n I'd really like to have some of the people here attend one of these types of mega churches once and attempt to approach the pastor and see how close they can get before being intercepted by an armed man-servant with a bluetooth ear piece jus' like the secret service has.\n \n All this is is hypocracy and moral failures.\n \n And Archy, you have a standard to live up to. The one set forth by GOD.\n People like me (who, in all likelihood has more evil assault weapons and enough ammo to wipe out my community (PRAISE THE 2ND!)) don't.\n \n I'm all for killing crazy beotches. I thought it sad the other day when that 55yr old man was killed by police near me but, he must have had 'kill me' written all over himself to have started taking pot shots in front of a freaking police station. \n \n But, I'm left to wonder WHY a church thinks it's necessary to have members carry guns (when other non-lethal devices are common) when the number of shootings at churches is virtually non-existant.\n It's like going to Mars and bringing moist towlettes just in case there's BBQ there to eat. And more asinine so when your belief system says you can't eat BBQ.\n I just guess they felt the need to protect themselves from the crazies (who are often attracted to this style of religion) or those they defraud (and there are MANY examples of this) rather than exploit the millions of dollars they bring in and actually have outreach programs worth a damn. \n One of the shows I synopsed today was NPR's Speaking of Faith with Rick Warren being interviewed. He stated that his Mega church was only the very tip of the iceberg of the social programs and outreach activities and missions they engaged in in CA.\n \n Personally, I'm going to speculate that the holy spirit descended upon the shooter and was sent out into the community to test self-professed Christians and visit the Wrath of God upon the sinners.\n Biblical passages would support this idea.\n \n But, in a secular manner, I mourn the 'innocent victims' and don't believe that such an event should have befallen them. \n In a biblical manner, I think the heretics at New Life are obviously suffering eternal damnation as are the youth slain at the mission center. Their own stated theology supports this.\n \n \n *you know, it's not easy doing things for strangers. \n While Christians are called to personally do the work that Jesus commanded in aiding them, most simply toss some money into a plate and 'hire' someone else to do it for them. I recall haveing a couple of shady people come to my home when I was a teen alone with my younger brother, knocking on the door and stating they were hungry. I didn't have any money but, I made them sandwiches. And the Asian couple who couldn't speak English approaching me on my job in the middle of winter seeking help for their stalled car. While not my job, I made time to get it jumped and see them off.\n And while kindness is no stranger to many, I'm often puzzled at the excuses Christians give to avoid doing something required of their faith.\n \n So, Arch, next time you see someone stranded on the side of the road, please pass them by. They could be one of those crazies you hear about often out to get ya. Stopping by to help is for an unsaved, non-believing Samaritian type.\n \n And yeah Jim, let's arm everyone. Only a few bucks for the gun and ammo. Much more cheaper than seeing if Christian compassion in the 1st instance would have prevented all the slaughter to begin with and resulted in NO deaths or injuries. \n I mean, WOW, this was a chance for Christians to do their job even a chance to help a potentially troubled spirit and evangelize...instead of get into a GUN FIGHT.\n Ironic that this apparently started at a TRAINING CENTER FOR MISSIONARIES!\n \n I guess these soon to be prosyletizers hadn't gotten that far in the 1st book of the NT yet. \n And from what I've witnessed, it's not that big of an issue with WofFers.\n \n Lets review what former New Life pastor Ted Haggard has been doing since kicked out.\n \n \nIn August 2007, Haggard released a statement asking for monetary donations to help support his family while he and his wife attend classes at the University of Phoenix. The former pastor also said that his family was moving into the Dream Center, a Phoenix based halfway house which ministers to recovering convicts, drug addicts, prostitutes etc. Haggard is pursuing a degree in counseling while his wife Gayle is studying psychology.\n Following Haggard's request for donations, a member of Haggard's restoration team said he should have consulted with them before releasing a statement. News media pointed to his reported income: in 2006, he received $115,000 for the 10 months he worked and also received an $85,000 anniversary bonus shortly before the scandal broke; after the scandal broke, the board of trustees of New Life Church agreed to give him an $138,000 severance. Additionally, the Haggards have a home in Colorado Springs, Colorado that is valued at more than $700,000 and Haggard still receives royalties from books he has authored. \n Questions also surfaced about the tax-exempt group Haggard asked that donations be sent to, on his behalf - Families With a Mission. According to Haggard, the group would use 10% of donations for administrative costs and forward 90% to Haggard. But the group was dissolved in February 2007, according to the Colorado Secretary of State.\n A few days after Haggard's initial email statement, his restoration team stepped in to say his statement was \"inappropriate\" and that \"Haggard was a little ahead of himself\". They indicated that Haggard would not be working at the Dream Center or in ministry of any kind and that they advised Haggard to seek secular employment to support himself and his family\n\n \n Yep, still got the hand out for donations when it seems he really doesn't need them. And from what I gather the Univ of Phoenix is nothing more than a degree mill. I have one of their branches in the office building I work in.\n Anyone what to speculate whether he still has funds OR has he already blown it all on being 'completely heterosexual' with male prostitutes and meth use...",

   "Welp, apparently the shooter was previously kicked out of the Youth with a Mission 3 years prior himself.\n \n \nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (Dec. 10) - The gunman believed to have killed four people at a megachurch and a missionary training school had been thrown out of the school a few years ago and had been sending it hate mail, police said in court papers Monday.\n \n The gunman was identified as Matthew Murray, 24, who was home-schooled in what a friend said was a deeply religious Christian household. Murray's father is a neurologist and a leading multiple-sclerosis researcher\n Five people - including Murray - were killed, and five others wounded Sunday in the two eruptions of violence 12 hours and 65 miles apart.\n \n The first attack took place at Youth With a Mission, a training center for missionaries in the Denver suburb of Arvada; the other occurred at the New Life Church in Colorado Springs, where Murray was shot by a security guard, though investigators said he may have died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n \n \"Through both investigations it has been determined that most likely the suspect in both shootings are one in the same,\" police said in court papers.\n \n Colorado Springs police said the \"common denominator in both locations\" was Youth With a Mission. The training center maintains an office at the 10,000-member church.\n \n \"It appears that the suspect had been kicked out of the program three years prior and during the past few weeks had sent different forms of hate mail to the program and-or its director,\" police said.\n \n Murray's relatives said they were grief-stricken and baffled.\n \n \"Our family cannot express the magnitude of our grief for the victims and families of this tragedy. On our behalf of our family, and our son, we ask for forgiveness. We cannot understand why this has happened,\" they said in a statement read by the gunman's uncle, Phil Abeyta, who fought back tears.\n \n In a statement, the training center said health problems kept Murray from finishing the program. It did not elaborate. Murray did not complete the lecture phase or a field assignment as part of a 12-week program, Youth With a Mission said.\n \n \"The program directors felt that issues with his health made it inappropriate for him to\" finish, it said.\n \n Police gave no immediate details on the hate mail. And the training center said that Murray left in 2002 - five years ago, not three - and that no one there can recall any visits or other communication from him since then.\n \n Earlier Monday, a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity said it appeared Murray \"hated Christians.\"\n \n Investigators have not said whether Murray singled out his victims. But the two people killed at the church - sisters Stephanie and Rachael Works, ages 18 and 16 - frequented the training center, their uncle Mark Schaepe of Lincoln, Neb., told The Gazette of Colorado Springs.\n \n Authorities searched the Murray house on a quiet street in Englewood on Monday for guns, ammunition and computers. No one was home when a reporter visited the split-level brick home early Monday. Murray's father, Ronald S. Murray, is chief executive of the Rocky Mountain Multiple Sclerosis Center in Englewood.\n \n Matthew Murray lived there along with a brother, Christopher, 21, a student at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Okla.\n \n A neighbor, Cody Askeland, 19, said the brothers were home-schooled, describing the whole family as \"very, very religious.\"\n \n Christopher studied for a semester at Colorado Christian University before transferring to Oral Roberts, said Ronald Rex, dean of admissions and marketing at Colorado Christian. He said Matthew Murray had been in contact with school officials this summer about attending the school but decided he wasn't interested because he thought the school was too expensive.\n \n Police said Murray's only previous brush with the law was a traffic ticket earlier this year.\n \n Senior Pastor Brady Boyd of New Life Church said the gunman had no connection to the church. \"We don't know this shooter,\" Boyd said. \"He showed up on our property yesterday with a gun with the intention of hurting people, and he did.\"\n \n The gunman opened fire at 12:30 a.m. at the Youth With a Mission center. Witnesses said the man asked to spend the night there and opened fire with a handgun when he was turned down. They described him as a young man, perhaps 20, in a dark jacket and cap.\n \n Later, at New Life Church, a gunman wearing a trench coat and carrying a high-powered rifle opened fire in the parking lot and later walked into the church as a service was letting out.\n \n Jeanne Assam, a church member who volunteers as a security guard, shot Murray, who was found with a rifle and two handguns, police said.\n \n Assam said she believes God gave her the strength to confront Murray, keeping her calm and focused.\n \n \"It seemed like it was me, the gunman and God,\" she said at a news conference.\n \n The pastor credited her with preventing more bloodshed.\n \n \"There could have been a great loss of life yesterday, and she probably saved over 100 lives.\"\n \n Boyd said the gunman had a lot of ammunition and estimated that 40 rounds had been fired inside the church, leaving what looked like a \"war scene.\"\n \n About 7,000 people were in and around the church the time of the shooting, Boyd said. Security had been beefed up after the shootings hours earlier in Arvada, he said. The church had a total of 15 to 20 volunteer security officers inside at the time of the attack, he said.\n \n Some members of the congregation reacted with compassion and forgiveness, in keeping with their faith.\n \n Ashley Gibbs was getting into a car with David Harris when they heard the gunshots. They stayed in the vehicle.\n \n \"It was obvious that he was in some sort of pain and going through a lot,\" Gibbs told NBC's \"Today\" show. \"I just prayed God would bring him peace.\"\n \n New Life, with a largely upper middle-class membership, was founded by the Rev. Ted Haggard, who was dismissed last year after a former male prostitute alleged he had a three-year cash-for-sex relationship with him. Haggard admitted committing unspecified \"sexual immorality.\"\n \n The two people killed at the missionary center were identified as Tiffany Johnson, 26, and Philip Crouse, 24.\n \n Johnson, who grew up in Chisholm, Minn., loved working with children and wanted to see the world, said family friend Carla Macynski.\n \n \"Tiffany was a well-liked, easygoing 26-year-old. She was friendly, adventurous and a definite leader,\" Macynski said as she choked back tears. Johnson had traveled to Egypt, Libya and South Africa with the missionary group.\n \n Crouse, of Alaska, was a former skinhead who went through a dramatic spiritual conversion at 18. He had helped build a foster home at a Crow Indian reservation in Montana, said Ronny Morris, who works with a Denver chapter of the mission.\n \n \"Whenever somebody asks me to give a specific situation where a kid's life has been changed or transformed, I always think of Phil, because he had such a radical transformation of life,\" said pastor Zach Chandler in Anchorage, Alaska.\n \n Youth With a Mission was started in 1960 and has 1,100 locations with 16,000 full-time staff, said Darv Smith, director of a Youth With a Mission center in Boulder.\n \n The Colorado shootings came days after a 19-year-old gunman opened fire at a busy department store in Omaha, Neb., killing eight people and himself.\n \n Associated Press Religion Writer Eric Gorski and AP writers Colleen Slevin and Jacques Billeaud in Denver, George Merritt in Arvada and Lara Jakes Jordan in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n \n Yep, WOFF's\n And you want to know the 'reason' why this guys medical condition made it inappropriate for him to finish classes?\n Because according to the WofF theology, as I've said repeatedly, is their belief that physical ailment and even poverty are CURSES from GOD. A God whom they believe promises physical health and wealth (in accordance to their covenant promises) to His followers.\n If you are sick, you are being demonically attacked. If you can not get well, you have unconfessed sin. If they lay hands on you and it doesn't work, it is your own fault for not having the 'god kinda faith'.\n With these beliefs, it's no wonder that their pastors seek financial reward up to and including using many of the unsavory tactics I've stated here and that have been found in various news and government investigations. The pastor is an example and as such must show that he is blessed as God wants him to be. Drive the Lexus. Fly in the personal jet. Wear Armani and Prada and don't pay yor bills.\n And when 'sick'. They simply deny it as a symptom of demonic attack and pretend it doesn't exist. Nope, no illness...right up until the point many die.\n \n The poor nutter guy. Forced into such a belief system due to his parents ignorance and pride. Oral Roberts merely repeats this style of theology.\\\n But, unfortunatly many are. It's so persuasive.\n All that 'feel good' experience based jump around and get your 'praise-on' shouting out 'amens' and 'preach on pastor' while babbling like a fool or wallowing on the floor because, and I quote, \"This IS the way you're supposed top worship...bible says so!\"\n Yeah, I guess this is one of their self fulfilling prophesies coming to pass.\n 'You are a sinner and possessed by the demon of sickness...we can't have your kind here.'\n Eventually, you become that diabolically inspired demon out to kill...and whom better to do so than those who tormented you.\n \n Looks like this sinner will have those he's slain as company in the lake of fire. \n \n Bible says so.\n \n We should be ever thankful for such examples of damnation given to us by the Lord out God as reminder that we need to be ever mindful of our walk in Christ...eh Arch?\n Praise the Lord who's vengence is swift. Thine justice is perfect.\n I postrate myself before Thee...and it's just not because I dropped the firing pin to my .50 Barretta.\n I give thee thanks for these signs and portents of the end to come.\n Surely we await on bended knee for your Son's swift return.\n Amen!\n Amen!\n Amen!",

   "OK Zardoz, Since Word of Lifers is the only church doctrine you seem to know about. I thought I would post their statement of faith for you. I'm not saying I agree with every single aspect of it but I'll let you tell me what is so wrong with what they believe since you are speaking for God and the bible so readily. \n Word of Life Church\n \n Home\n Vision Statement\n What We Believe\n \n We Believe...\n \u0095THE SCRIPTURES - The Bible is the inspired Word of God, the product of holy men of old who spoke and wrote as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. The New Covenant, as recorded in the New Testament, we accept as our infallible guide in matters pertaining to conduct and doctrine.\n (Scriptures: Second Timothy 3:16; First Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Peter 1:21)\n \n We Believe...\n \u0095THE GODHEAD - Our God is one, but manifested in 3 persons - the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, being co-equal. God the Father is greater than all; the sender of the word (Logos) and the Begetter. The Son is the Word flesh-covered, the One Begotten, and has existed with the Father from the beginning. The Holy Spirit proceeds forth from both the Father and the Son and is eternal.\n ** We see these truths in that the Son, while on the earth and in heaven, submitted Himself to the Father. A couple examples are 1) In the Garden of Gethsemane when Jesus said, \"Not My will but Yours be done...\", and 2) Jesus asked the Father to send the Holy Spirit. It's obvious from scripture that the Father is the head over the Son (the Son sits at the Father's right hand). At the same time we also know that Jesus said He and the Father are One, and He said that before Abraham was \"I AM\" which not only presents Himself as God it also shows that Jesus, like the Father, is both eternal and omnipotent (all-powerful). \n (Scriptures: Philippians 2:6; John 14:28, John 16:28, John 1:14, John 15:16)\n \n We Believe...\n \u0095MAN, HIS FALL AND REDEMPTION - Man is a created being, made in the likeness and image of God. But through Adam's transgression and fall, sin came into the world, \"...all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, \" and \"... There is none righteous, no, not one. \" Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was manifested to destroy the work of the devil and gave His life and shed His blood to redeem and restore man back to God. Salvation is the gift of God to man, separate from works of the Law, and is made operative by grace through faith in Jesus Christ, producing works acceptable to God.\n (Scriptures: Romans 5:12-15; Romans 3:10; Romans 3:23; First John 3:8; Ephesians 2:8-10)\n \n We Believe...\n \u0095ETERNAL LIFE AND THE NEW BIRTH - Man's first step toward salvation is godly sorrow that works repentance. The New Birth is necessary to all men, and when experienced produces eternal life. \n (Scriptures: 2 Corinthians 7:10; 1 John 5:12; John 3:3-5)\n \n We Believe...\n \u0095SANCTIFICATION - The Bible teaches that without holiness no man can see the Lord. We believe in the Doctrine of Sanctification as a definite, yet progressive work of grace, commencing at the time of regeneration and continuing until the consummation of salvation at Christ's return. \n (Scripture: Hebrews 12:14; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; 2 Peter 3:18; 2 Corinthians 3:18; Philippians 3:12-14; 1 Corinthians 1:30)\n \n We Believe...\n \u0095RESURRECTION OF THE JUST AND THE RETURN OF OUR LORD - The angel said to Jesus' disciples \"...this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.\" His coming is imminent. When He comes, \"...the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air...\" Following the tribulation, He shall return to earth as King of kings, and Lord of lords, and together with His saints who shall be kings and priests, He shall reign a thousand years.\n (Scriptures: Acts: 1:11; First Thessalonians 4: 16,17; Revelation 20:6)\n \n We Believe...\n \u0095DIVINE HEALING - Healing is for physical ills of the human body and is wrought by the power of God through the prayer of faith, and by the laying on of hands. It is provided for in the atonement of Christ, and is the privilege of every member of the Church today.\n (Scriptures: Mark 16:18; James 5:14,15; First Peter 2:24; Matthew 8:17; Isaiah 53:4,5)\n \n We Believe...\n \u0095HELL AND ETERNAL RETRIBUTION - The one who physically dies in his sins without accepting Christ is hopelessly and eternally lost in the lake of fire and, therefore, has no further opportunity of hearing the gospel or repenting. The lake of fire is literal. The terms \"eternal\" and \"everlasting,\" used in describing the duration of punishment of the damned in the lake of fire, carry the same thought and meaning of endless existence as used in denoting the duration of joy and ecstasy of saints in the Presence of God. \n (Scripture: Hebrews 9: 27; Revelation 19:20)\n \n We Believe...\n \u0095WATER BAPTISM - Baptism in water is by immersion, is a direct commandment of our Lord, and is for believers only. The ordinance is a symbol of the Christian's identification with Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection.\n (Scriptures: Matthew 28:19; Romans 6:4; Colossians 2:12; Acts 8: 36-39)\n \n We Believe...\n \u0095BAPTISM IN THE HOLY GHOST - The Baptism in the Holy Ghost and fire is a gift from God as promised by the Lord Jesus Christ to all believers in this dispensation and is received subsequent to the New Birth. This experience is accompanied by the initial evidence of speaking in other tongues as the Holy Spirit Himself gives utterance.\n (Scriptures: Matthew 3:11; John 14:16,17; Acts 1:8; Acts 2:38,39; Acts 19: 1-7; Acts 2:4)\n ",

   "OK Zardoz, Since Word of Lifers is the only church doctrine you seem to know about. I thought I would post their statement of faith for you. I'm not saying I agree with every single aspect of it but I'll let you tell me what is so wrong with what they believe since you are speaking for God and the bible so readily.\n\n \n It's not Word of Life...\n \n It's Word of Faith.\n I only say it about a billion times here.\n \n Furthermore, it's not the only sect I know about.\n Any main-stream and periphery sect I know about.\n I've even been deposed in a court of law as to the level of knowledge I have about Christian religion in general.\n Have you?\n \n Can you tell a oneness pentecostal from one who isn't and tell them both apart from a word of faither?\n \n Have you not read my posts claiming who the head WofFers are?\n Benny Hinn.\n The Copelands\n The Crouches\n T.D. Jakes (ones pentecostal variety)\n Joel Olsteen\n Ted Haggard\n Joyce Myers\n etc.\n TBN is their main TV network.\n \n For the most part, they are televangelist and tent revival hucksters who often do have their own church buildings.\n Since they have such a large viewing on TV, they get fans who come to see them in real life. Thus, their need for super large buildings called mega churches.\n \n It's more accuratly described as a 'movement' as each pastor preaches what he desires. Some claim the JDS doctrine (Jesus had to go to hell for your salvation, his death on the cross was meaningless...called Jesus Died Spiritually). Some don't.\n The issues in common with them is that God promises worldly wealth and health to His followers.\n \n Founders of the movement are Kenyon who was usurped by Kenneth Hagin and formed Rhema (their version of a seminary).\n \n As said, they can have a plethora of differeing beliefs under the same heading. Nearly all of them nonsensical and anti-biblical. \n Some Word of Life (sweden) are Word of Faith.\n \n \n But, in conclusion, I never said I know only about WofFers. But, they'r the nail that sticks up the most often AND the very church (New Life) that was the subject of this shooting.\n \n And P.S.\n WofFers meet EVERY requirement for a false prophet and a false teacher as described in the OT and NT.\n And repeatedly I have asked readers here to investigate and learn more about the various sects particularly WofF.\n WofF, being the predominate TV and entertainment (Hill Song and other groups) for Christians gives them a foothold into your theology. Where they slowly pervert and corrupt. Eventually, you take that corruption back to your own church and spread it.\n Many other sects have been tainted by it.\n Catholicism (by Hispanics) Baptists of all stripes amongst them.\n It's not too hard to find someone who will bite the line they toss.\n \n Thus, for some, you have the generic statements of faith you listed, once there, you slowly learn that there's a LOT more that they slowly elaborate on that goes beyond that.\n \n If you're going to sup the kool-aid, know the flavor.",

   "Ok, here is the Word of Faith statement of faith and it appears to be identical to the Word of Life's statement of faith. WHY DIDN'T YOU KNOW THEY ARE AFFILIATED if you know the doctrines so well? Here it is, with the link.\n \n http://www.wordoffaithchurch.com/\n WHAT WE BELIEVE\n \n THE SCRIPTURES\n The Bible is the inspired Word of God, the product of holy men of old who spoke and wrote as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. The New Covenant, as recorded in the New Testament, we accept as our infallible guide in matters pertaining to conduct and doctrine. (2 Timothy 3:16; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Peter 1:21)\n \n THE GODHEAD\n Our God is one, but manifested in three persons - the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, being co-equal. (Philippians 2:6)\n \n MAN, HIS FALL, AND REDEMPTION\n Man is a created being, made in the likeness and image of God, but through Adam's transgression and fall, sin came into the world. \"All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.\" \"As it is written, there is none righteous, no, not one.\" Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was manifested to undo the work of the devil, and gave His life and shed His blood to redeem and restore man back to God. (Romans 5:12; Romans 3:23; Romans 3:10; 1 John 3:8)\n \n ETERNAL LIFE AND THE NEW BIRTH\n Man's first step toward salvation is godly sorrow that worketh repentance, meaning a changing of mind and purpose and the turning toward God. The new birth is necessary to all men, and when fulfilled produces eternal life. Man is saved by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost, and being justified by grace through faith in Christ Jesus. (2 Corinthians 7:10; 1 John 5:12; John 3:3-5; Romans 10:9-10)\n \n SANCTIFICATION\n The Bible teaches that without holiness no man can see the Lord. We believe in the doctrine of sanctification as a definite, yet progressive work of grace, commencing at the time of regeneration and continuing until the consummation of salvation. (Hebrews 12:14; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; 2 Peter 3:18; 2 Corinthians 3:18; Philippians 3:12-14; 1 Corinthians 1:30)\n \n BAPTISM IN THE HOLY GHOST\n The baptism in the Holy Ghost and fire is a gift from God as promised by the Lord Jesus Christ to all believers and is received subsequent to and distinct from the new birth. This experience is accompanied by the Biblical evidence of speaking in other tongues as the Holy Spirit Himself gives utterance. (Matthew 3:11; John 14:16-17; Acts 1:8; Acts 2:38-39; Acts 19:1-7; Acts 2:4)\n \n WATER BAPTISM\n Baptism in water is by immersion and is a direct commandment of our Lord, and is for believers only. The ordinance is the showing forth of the Christian's identification with Christ in His death, burial and resurrection. (Matthew 28:19; Romans 6:4; Colossians 2:12; Acts 8:36-39; Mark 16:15-16)\n \n THE LORD's SUPPER\n The Lord's Supper, consisting of the elements of bread and the fruit of the vine, is the symbol expressing a memorial of Jesus' suffering and death and a prophecy of His second coming and is enjoined on all believers until He comes. (1 Corinthians 11:26; 2 Peter 1:4)\n \n DIVINE HEALING\n Divine healing is provided for in the redemption of Christ, and it is the privilege of every believer today. Divine healing is an integral part of the gospel. (Mark 16:18; James 5:14-16; 1 Peter 2:24; Matthew 8:17; Isaiah 53:4-5)\n \n RESURRECTION OF THE JUST AND THE RETURN OF OUR LORD\n The angels said, \"This same Jesus shall so come in like manner.\" His coming is imminent. When He comes, \"the dead in Christ shall rise first, then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the air.\" Following the tribulation, He shall return to earth as King of kings and Lord of lords, and together with His saints, who shall be kings and priests, He shall reign a thousand years. (Acts 1:11; 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17; Revelation 20:6)\n \n THE FINAL JUDGMENT \n There will be a final judgment in which the wicked dead will be raised and judged according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Lamb's book of life, together with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to everlasting punishment in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death. (Matthew 25:46; Mark 9:43-48; Revelation 19:20; Revelation 20:11-15; Revelation 21:8)\n \n HELL AND ETERNAL RETRIBUTION\n The one who physically dies in his sins without Christ is hopelessly and eternally lost in the lake of fire, and therefore has no further opportunity of hearing the Gospel or for repentance. The lake of fire is literal. (Hebrews 9:27; Revelation 19:20)",
