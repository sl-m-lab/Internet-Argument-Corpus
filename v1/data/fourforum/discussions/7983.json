   "Tony Blair told George Bush where to get off with Iran war\n \n \n  http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=577092006 \n \n TONY BLAIR:\n \n \nBritain cannot offer military support to any strike on Iran, regardless of whether the move wins the backing of the international community.\n \n \n Yes! This is attaboy! At last Tony's done something for his nation's security improvement! ^_^ I wish I could shake your hand, pal! You had to have lot of courage to rebuff Bush! \n \n But wait! I wonder what made him take this abrupt turnabout. Does it have to do with the information on prearranged mass terror acts in Great Britain and its dominions Canada and Australia? I heard that branch terrorist organizations of Al-Quaida were ultimatively making threatens with retaliatory actions on the territory of British empire with the assist of local Moslem suicide attackers if Britain supports America's strike on Iran. If it's so, then shame on you, Tony! You only want to save your bacon, chicken! Anyway, of course Tony is a sucker, but it is good he starts to care about security of common people, though it is to the detriment of British-American good relationship.",

Depending on who's numbers one prefers, expert opinions are three years for Iran to come up with a single nuke, a dozen in seven years, assuming an all-out application of resources. This time frame is never discussed by US media or US politicians, so general citizenry in the UK, Europe and Asia aren't being beaten up by the fear motive current US administration used in the US for Iraq and now Iran. Nor are other nations experiencing the desperate entrapment of selling massive debt to keep financially afloat as we in the US live with. I don't offer that as an excuse, we're stuck with ####-poor management.",

The US, for the last 60 years, has been entirely occupied with ensuring the supremacy of capitalism, and the US ability to make money, via the use of force and coercion. That is the thread that runs through every US intervention of the last 60 years, and WW2 as well. These goals have, from time to time, coincided with toppling dictators, but only when they disliked america. The US has been more than happy to prop up dictators in many other places. For a long time, don't forget, Saddam Hussein was a bulwark against the Ayatollahs, meanwhile the Taliban were freedom fighters against the evil commies, and the Shah was a strong hand in the region. The Saudis are still backed by US force, and are one of the more brutal regimes in the world. But they're ok, because they keep the oil flowing through american hands.",
