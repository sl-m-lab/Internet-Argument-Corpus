I tried so hard not to, but when the celebrant asked me to repeat after him, with the vows I wrote my self.....I tried and tried and tried, but couldn't speak. I was too moved by the moment and all I could do was cry....\n \n I love my partner with all my heart....So I wanted to get through, I thought about our taxes (didn't work).

For example in Romans, the reference was to acts involving idol worship, and acts which went against someone's personal nature. For example the men were really hetersexual, but they performed same-sex sexual acts, acts which went against their heterosexual nature. I have a bit of a problem with the notion that God could give people up to sexual things. What control does God have here to give up? Makes one a little squeemish. Is that really how you want to see your God?\n \n As for Corinthians, in its original Greek, Paul didn't use the commonly understood Greek term for male homosexuals of that period, so it is open to interpretation what he meant. He could have been merely referring to immoral or exploitative relationships. If he were condeming homosexuals specifically, he would have surely used the term. Also, your version, the NIV, I believe, uses the term \"homosexual offenders\". That doesn't refer to all homosexuals. For example, if we saw the term \"heterosexual offenders\", we wouldn't take that to refer to all heterosexuals, only to the bad among that group.",

   "Some believe that is a problem with translation and interpretation. For example in Romans, the reference was to acts involving idol worship, and acts which went against someone's personal nature. For example the men were really hetersexual, but they performed same-sex sexual acts, acts which went against their heterosexual nature. I have a bit of a problem with the notion that God could give people up to sexual things. What control does God have here to give up? Makes one a little squeemish. Is that really how you want to see your God?\n \n As for Corinthians, in its original Greek, Paul didn't use the commonly understood Greek term for male homosexuals of that period, so it is open to interpretation what he meant. He could have been merely referring to immoral or exploitative relationships. If he were condeming homosexuals specifically, he would have surely used the term. Also, your version, the NIV, I believe, uses the term \"homosexual offenders\". That doesn't refer to all homosexuals.

To say that these are all mistranslations is a bit of a stretch and seems as if you are trying to twist words into making it say what you wish it to say. It just is what it is.\n\n \n Hmm, after reading this, my question is as follows: exactly what does the term Paul used mean? Is it nothing more than another word for \"homosexuals\"? Or does it not actually mean \"homosexuals\" at all? If not, then Jyoshu's comparison to the word \"XXXXX\" is inappropriate, for the word \"XXXXX\" does refer to homosexuality.\n \n It seems to me that you suggested the word Paul used means \"homosexual offenders\". Is that correct? If so, then it appears to me very certain that the Bible was mistranslated three or four times, despite your skepticism of that possibility. Is the mistranslation so important with that meaning? Perhaps not, I really just mean to say that the fact that the Bible was translated in the same fashion three or four times doesn't mean that it was mistranslated the same way each of those times. Let's figure out what the word actually means, then determine the correct translation for ourselves.\n \n That being said, I remember reading a few times that the word Paul uses does not refer to homosexuality at all, but merely \"indecent acts\" or something along those lines. I also remember reading that Paul used this same word in other places in the Bible at times when he most certainly was not referring to homosexuality. If these things are true, then it does not appear likely to me that Paul was referring to homosexuality, for although Jyoshu is right that an English-speaker means the same thing if he uses \"XXXXX\" instead of \"gay\", he likely does not mean the same thing if he uses \"indecent acts\" instead of \"homosexuality\".\n \n Now, I'm not certain of the accuracy of what I've written above, and I do not believe I retained the sources in which I read this, so perhaps we can look together to determine whether what I've said is correct or not.\n \n Some sources I came up with in a random Google search are:\n http://www.gaysouthafrica.org.za/homosexuality/bible.asp\n http://www.truluck.com/html/six_bible_passages.html\n http://www.whosoever.org/bible/corin.html\n http://www.whosoever.org/bible/tim.html\n \n The whosoever links above seem to me the most informed on the topic, though I would not mind another opinion.\n \n \nI would argue that you have not refuted what it says in the Bible. Christians believe the Bible is the Word of God. Jesus happens to be God. To say that Jesus did not say everything would not be accurate. The Bible is very clear on the issue of homosexuality and I would say that if one can not see this then how can they say they know God?\n\n \n People with believe structures and religions far different than yours claim to know God, if you are a true follower of Christianity, should you not suspect that those of completely different religions are incorrect about their relationship with God before you suspect a fellow Christian who holds a single difference in opinion about the teachings of the Bible?\n \n \nOn a side note, I would hope in the future you would refrain from calling me \"not very bright\". I tend to give one warning as many know.\n\n \n I should just mention here that this is a debate, and such insults will happen. If they do, it is appropriate to point them out, as you have done.

   "\"It is extremely revealing to note that almost every pro-gay group within the church shares one thing in common: they reject the Bible as being fully the Word of God. Of the above mentioned denominations which have accepted homosexuality or are sympathetic to it, none of them believe that we have God's inerrant Word in the Old and New Testaments. Likewise, the many pro-homosexual books that have come out almost all reject - or even ridicule - the church's historic stance on the inspiration and authority of Scripture. \n \n Three different lines of attack on Scripture are found in the various pro-homosexual literature. The first is simply to ignore the biblical writers on the grounds that they were men who oftentimes made mistakes, and thus to reject what Scripture says as being morally authoritative. Thus John Barton states that \"the Bible is not a code at all; it is a big baggy compendium of a book, full of variety and inconsistency, sometimes mistaken on matters of fact and theology alike.\"17 And elsewhere, in John Boswell's widely cited work, we find: \"In considering the supposed influence of certain biblical passages...one must first relinquish the concept of a single book containing a uniform corpus of writings accepted as morally authoritative.\"18 \n \n A second attack relates to the first - that is, the biblical writers were ignorant about homosexuality. They did not know all that we do today, it is argued, and so we must judge and interpret the Bible with our modern understanding of biology, psychology, sociology, and so forth. \"With the quantum leaps that have been achieved in biology, psychology, and sociology, minds in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries must subject traditional religious arguments about nature to more thorough and critical analyses.\"19 \n \n It is not within the purview of this article to give a detailed defense of the inspiration and reliability of the Bible.20 However, the simple response to these attacks is that both Judaism and Christianity have always held to the full authority of Scripture, as did Jesus Himself. In speaking of the Old Testament, for example, our Lord succinctly declared: \"Scripture cannot be broken\" (John 10:35).\"\n\n \n http://www.equip.org/free/DH055-2.htm\n \n \nDo you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders... (1 Cor. 6:9, NIV) \n \n \"In both 1 Corinthians 6:9 and 1 Timothy 1:10 the apostle Paul states that those guilty of sexual immorality will not inherit the kingdom of God. At the time Paul wrote his letters there was no word in classical, biblical, or patristic Greek which corresponded with our English term \"homosexual.\" Instead, homosexual behavior was described (e.g., Rom. 1:26-27). The words Paul uses here - malakoi (\"male prostitute\") and arsenokoitai (\"homosexual offenders\") - have been translated in different ways. Because of this those condoning homosexuality have tried to lessen the impact of these verses, saying that all Paul was condemning was either homosexual prostitution or pederasty (i.e., men having sexual relations with boys).34 \n \n Virtually every Greek lexicon, however, including all of the standard English ones, has understood these words (especially arsenokoitai) to be referring to homosexuality. 35 Arndt and Gingrich's lexicon says malakoi refers to persons who are \"soft, effeminate, especially of catamites, men and boys who allow themselves to be misused homosexually.\"36 Likewise, arsenokoites means \"a male homosexual, pederast, sodomite.\"37 \n \n We also find these terms in classical Greek literature (e.g., Lucian and Aristotle) \"sometimes applied to obviously gay persons.\"38 As well, if Paul were only condemning certain types of homosexuality he would certainly have specified this. Instead, he used a term directly based on the Greek Septuagint translation of the prohibitions against homosexuality in Leviticus: \n \n meta arsenos ou koimethese koiten \n gynaikos (Lev. 18:22) \n koimethe meta arsenos koiten \n gynaikos (Lev. 20:13)39 \n \n Paul, a rabbi thoroughly trained in the Torah, was certainly mindful of these Levitical condemnations and the Septuagint translation of them when he chose his wording in 1 Corinthians and 1 Timothy.\" \n",

   "With the presentation of a different source by Jyoshu, claiming that the words of the Paul do indeed indicate homosexuality. This being the case, we must determine which source is accurate and which is not. Being a supporter of gay rights, I will attempt to find flaws in Jyoshu's source (Gudel).\n \n The first quote that Jyoshu listed deals primarily with arguments not presented in this thread, and the first paragraph of the second quote more reiterates those arguments than anything else. So I will begin with where Jyoshu's author starts justifying his opinion, in the second paragraph of the second quote.\n \n \nVirtually every Greek lexicon, however, including all of the standard English ones, has understood these words (especially arsenokoitai) to be referring to homosexuality. 35 Arndt and Gingrich's lexicon says malakoi refers to persons who are \"soft, effeminate, especially of catamites, men and boys who allow themselves to be misused homosexually.\"36 Likewise, arsenokoites means \"a male homosexual, pederast, sodomite.\"37 \n\n \n The sources this author uses here are interesting to note. The first important one, source 35 suggests that every virtually every Greek Lexicon has understood those words to be referring to homosexuality. However, if you note the sources at the bottom, you can see that this claim comes from a book by John Bowers called Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality.\n \n Although I was not able to find the text of this book, I did find this website:\n http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/index-bos.html\n \n It claims that in that book, Boswell \"proposes that homosexuals were accepted before the 13th century, and then intolerance sets in.\" Furthermore, it is the same source (source 34) that Jyoshu's author used above to reference the argument that the Bible does not actually oppose homosexuality. In such a book, the claim that just about every Greek Lexicon understands those words to refer to homosexuality likely comes with an explanation of how that does not truly indicate the intentions of the Bible. That explanation appears to have been left out of Gudel's writings, and although it will take one of us purchasing the book to figure this out for certain, I wonder if Boswell points out that because of lack of information about this word, just about every Greek Lexicon today bases that translation off of the common translations used in the Bible, not on the fashion that it would actually have been used at the time.\n \n I will have to think about purchasing Boswell's book.\n \n The second importan sources here, sources 36 and 37, come from A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature, which, by the sound of it, based its translations on the common Biblical translations at the time, not on the fashion in which the Greek would have used them. This is further evidenced in the fact that it lists \"sodomite\" in one of its definitions, for surely the Greek would not have had a word for a city which did not exist in their mythology.\n \n \nWe also find these terms in classical Greek literature (e.g., Lucian and Aristotle) \"sometimes applied to obviously gay persons.\"38 As well, if Paul were only condemning certain types of homosexuality he would certainly have specified this. Instead, he used a term directly based on the Greek Septuagint translation of the prohibitions against homosexuality in Leviticus: \n \n meta arsenos ou koimethese koiten \n gynaikos (Lev. 18:22) \n koimethe meta arsenos koiten \n gynaikos (Lev. 20:13)39 \n \n Paul, a rabbi thoroughly trained in the Torah, was certainly mindful of these Levitical condemnations and the Septuagint translation of them when he chose his wording in 1 Corinthians and 1 Timothy.\"\n\n \n A very good analysis of this can be found in the essay here:\n http://www.tms.edu/tmsj/tmsj3h.pdf\n \n This essay is written by James Young, and it argues that Paul was indeed referring to homosexuality. However, it also provides a more complete and balanced summary of the arguments of his opponents, including Boswell. I find the arguments provided by his opponents, especially Boswell, to be more compelling than the arguments against them listed by Young himself.\n \n I urge you to read Boswell's interpretation of the word on pages 3-6 of that article. He provides a very compelling argument suggesting that Paul created this term because he had no other appropriate way of referring to male prostitutes.\n \n Young in retaliation points out the relation to the passages in Leveticus described above, and he suggests that Paul created the word as something the Greek would easily recognize, however it does not seem likely to me that Paul would create a new word to describe something for which the words to describe it already existed.\n \n Anyhow, I hope that article is helpful.",

   "It strikes me that anyone arguing for gay marriage but not the examples you give are not really arguing for equality at all, but simply for the line to be drawn in a different place. The real issue in the marriage debate, when it's all boiled down, is whether marriage is to be broadened or not. The only way someone can make a consistent, non-hypocritical argument in favor of equality when it comes to marriage is to talk of extending marriage to ANY sort of arrangement that could ever come up, such as the one in your example. Otherwise, we're really just talking about moving the line a bit, which still wouldn't be equality.\n\n \n Do you still make this claim? Have I not stated numerous times that we argue for equality, but only when equality makes sense? Have I not explained that equality is appropriate in the case of same-sex marriage because there are no harms of same-sex marriage? The idea that anyone who argues in support of same-sex marriage must also argue in support of incestuous marriage or be hypocritical is absurd and untrue. It is absolutely possible to believe that same-sex marriage is a good thing while incestuous marriage is not. You might as well be saying that \"it is hypocritical to believe in opposite-sex marriage but not every form of marriage.\" I am amazed that you still state what you have after all the conversations we've had. No one here wants equality if there's a good reason for denying it. But no one has provided that good reason.\n \n That being said, I am still interested in your answer to unkerpaulie. I believe you have used it as an opportunity to call gay rights supporters hypocritical, which is fine (except that I disagree), but can you name a good reason that society should deny incestuous marriage?",

(i'm not saying that this is your position, but could you justify this kind of reasoning?)\n\n \n In order to suggest that we grant rights to some people which we deny to others, we must show some sort of harm in granting those rights. In the case of incestuous marriage, there are two arguments which I can imagine against incestuous marriage. The first involves the increased chance of having retarded children. One might suggest that this reason does not apply to incestuous couples who do not have children, however the response would be that by legalizing any form of incestuous marriage, we are putting incestuous relationships sexual on the same legal level as other forms of relationships, and in doing so, we are failing to reinforce the idea that having children via incestuous sex is wrong. If the harm of having a child via incestuous sex could be shown to be so great that it warrants denying the rights of incestuous couples to be recognized under our law, then it might be said that it is immoral not to discriminate against incestuous couples in such a fashion.\n \n Another possible reason for denying incestuous marriage stems from the increased ability of one family member to abuse his or her relationship with another family member in order to convince that family member that the love they share should be turned into a sexual relationship. To present a more simple example, a father may teach his daughter that she is to engage in sex with him. It might not be difficult to see how various other family relationships could be abused in the same fashion as the father-daughter relationship.\n \n The only comparison I can imagine being made between the two is that the AIDS virus or some other STD is more easily transmitted through homosexual sex, and the discouragement of this is similar to the discouragement of bearing retarded children. The problem with such an argument is that homosexual sex is not the action which causes AIDS; promiscuous sex is that action. Same-sex marriage, when implemented should serve as a discouragement for promiscuous sex among gay people, and perhaps the lack of recognition of same-sex unions has played a part in the increased rates of AIDS among gay people in the first place. Alternately, recognition of incestuous unions would increase the rate of incestuous children born if anything. This increase would debatably constitute a harm, however the possible decrease in AIDS from legalizing same-sex marriage must undoubtedly be considered a benefit.\n \n This all being said, I freely admit that I am no expert on the issue of incestuous relationships. I suggest these as possible reasons one might argue against it formed out of the small amount of thought I've garnered toward incestuous marriage, however I would not be surprised to see either or both rendered illogical, nor would I be surprised if an expert opponent of incestuous marriage came up with some better argument.\n \n If these harms and all others presented are shown to be irrational, then I would see no reason why incestuous marriage should not be made legal. I invite any here to disagree with my reasons, in which case we should make incestuous marriage legal, so far none have done so. I invite any here to present some harm common across both incestuous and homosexual marriage, but not across heterosexual marriage, which makes it impossible to support same-sex marriage while opposing incestuous marriage.

   "With the presentation of a different source by Jyoshu, claiming that the words of the Paul do indeed indicate homosexuality. This being the case, we must determine which source is accurate and which is not. Being a supporter of gay rights, I will attempt to find flaws in Jyoshu's source (Gudel).\n \n The sources this author uses here are interesting to note. The first important one, source 35 suggests that every virtually every Greek Lexicon has understood those words to be referring to homosexuality. However, if you note the sources at the bottom, you can see that this claim comes from a book by John Bowers called Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality. It claims that in that book, Boswell \"proposes that homosexuals were accepted before the 13th century, and then intolerance sets in.\" Furthermore, it is the same source (source 34) that Jyoshu's author used above to reference the argument that the Bible does not actually oppose homosexuality. In such a book, the claim that just about every Greek Lexicon understands those words to refer to homosexuality likely comes with an explanation of how that does not truly indicate the intentions of the Bible. \n\n \n It seems to me that even if that's the case, it doesn't weaken Gudel's argument. These are two different things to consider, not the same. Furthermore, it could be argued that for a source claiming homosexuality is permissible in the Bible to claim that just about every Greek Lexicon understands those words to refer to homosexuality only makes it that much harder for your side to refute--it could be seen as an admission from Boswell. \n \n \nThe second importan sources here, sources 36 and 37, come from A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature, which, by the sound of it, based its translations on the common Biblical translations at the time, not on the fashion in which the Greek would have used them. \n\n \n How do you figure? Typically lexicons are based on numerous things, one definitely being writings in the original languages. (in this case, non-Biblical, but still Greek from the period.)\n \n \nThis is further evidenced in the fact that it lists \"sodomite\" in one of its definitions, for surely the Greek would not have had a word for a city which did not exist in their mythology.\n\n \n Perhaps the lexicon simply translated the greek word for homosexual to \"sodomite.\" (A common term earlier in the 20th century and before.) I don't see why this would reflect on the author's premise that most Greek Lexicons understand those words to refer to homosexuality.\n \n \nThis essay is written by James Young, and it argues that Paul was indeed referring to homosexuality. However, it also provides a more complete and balanced summary of the arguments of his opponents, including Boswell. I find the arguments provided by his opponents, especially Boswell, to be more compelling than the arguments against them listed by Young himself.\n \n I urge you to read Boswell's interpretation of the word on pages 3-6 of that article. He provides a very compelling argument suggesting that Paul created this term because he had no other appropriate way of referring to male prostitutes.\n\n \n Heh, well I find Young to be more compelling. :) Paul may have just as easily wanted to use his own term for homosexuals to show in terminology that they are offensive by having homosexual behavior (\"homosexual offenders\"). Either way, I don't don't see Boswell's view any more compelling.\n \n \nhowever it does not seem likely to me that Paul would create a new word to describe something for which the words to describe it already existed.\n\n \n I doubt there was a word in place that indentified both homosexual relations AND it's offensiveness, in one word. Maybe there was, but I doubt it.",

They claim that what the Bible condemns is offensive homosexual (and heterosexual) behavior. But isn't it clear that when Paul speaks of \"homosexual offenders\" he is speaking of the offense of homosexuality itself? If only \"offensive\" kinds of homosexual acts were evil, then what about the rest of what Paul mentions in the same passage: adultery, idolatry, and so forth?\n \n What could be clearer than Paul's words in Romans, where he calls homosexuality \"sinful desire, sexual impurity\" and says that it is \"degrading and shameful\"? Or his unmistakably sharp words against giving oneself over \"to depravity\"? (Rom. 1:24-28) \n\n \n http://www.bruderhof.com/articles/jca/Homosexuality.htm?format=print",

   "Then what may lead to incest and polygamy is the fact that marriage is a legal institution, is that what you are saying? If so, these things may come up equally as a result of straight legal marriage or gay legal marriage or interracial legal marriage, or legal inter-faith marriage or legal marriage with legal divorce, etc. It doesn't relate specifically to gay legal marriage at all. \n\n \n What makes their argument disingenuous is that they conveniently leave out the fact that polygamy and incest both existed in marriage at one point (and in some instances, they still do. First cousins can marry in NY State, for example).\n \n Can any of them honestly explain how nixing gender requirements of the partners in a marriage act as a catalyst for adding the number of participants in a marriage, or how it relates (no pun intended) to marrying blood relations any more than marriage as it currently stands?\n \n \n \n\n I was saying this is how many people attempt an argument against gay marriage, by attempting to incite fear by spouting off a parade of horribles that have nothing to do with the issue of gay marriage. What if straight people are married and winged green monkeys come flying out of everyone's derriere in the future? What will you do then? Demonstrate how gay marriage specifically relates to incest and incestuous marriage and polygamy\n. \n \n You'll asphyxiate before you get an answer.",

It certainly doesn't say anything like that about these two men. \n \n Just because two men are close doesn't mean it's a sexual thing. To assume it by default is a very backwards way to think.",

   "The ceremonial law was no longer necessary. \n\n \n You are correct on this. There were two codes: a moral code and a ceremonial code. Things like eating shellfish were not the moral code--and these are the things that are often used to portray the OT law as 'outdated' by it's detrators. But Jesus made it clear that if anything, He was taking the law farther. The law said for instance, don't commit adultery. He said don't even do it in your heart. The moral code is still important.",

Like I said when you translate from hebrew to english you have to do some guess work. But it is a scientific fact that a percentage of the animal population as well as the human population is homosexual. It is natural to think that something is wrong with the minority. If most people are this way and a few are that way they must be commiting a sin or doing something wrong. That is a natural feeling. I just don't get it. Everyone has a sexual preference. If you say that homosexuality is a choice then your saying everyone one is heterosexual. Why if you are attracted to women would you want to be attracted to men. In the bible where it says that a man shall not lie with a man as a women it is an abomination, you have to understand that women in this time period were looked at as lower than a man so to put yourself in a womens position or a position of submission was an abomination. I guess you could say that it is against homosexuality but its more about putting yourself in the postion of a women b/c of how low women were in society. I will continue to say that I have no control over my arousal and even if I chose to be with men I would still be aroused by women. Please just think about this logically instead of just quoting the bible because there other moral issues in the bible specifically in Leviticus that you can't take seriously.",

   "For you maybe.

What is your point?\n \n \nThe potential for risk and harm is in any type of relationship. You are using the very same type of arguments that opponents of same sex marriage use when you say things like that.\n\n \n No, you know I was talking about a specific type of risk, specific to incest. However this is just a diversion.\n \n \nI think you missed the point of the analogy. The point is that it's not really equality if only two groups have it and no one else.\n\n \n Well, yes it is for the groups that have equality. We are not limited to either a certain set number of groups, no groups, or every single group or individual to have equality within a society.\n \n \nSo you are saying it's anarchy for anyone other than straights and gays to have marriage?\n\n \n No, I was saying the definition of total equality you are arguing, is similar to anarchy. Either, everything or nothing, in terms of laws, equality, classes, etc. We start off from that point without any laws, in anarchy. There are different types of equality. There is something between anarchy and authoritarianism, where there can and is equality. That's what our system is, where we debate and negotiate about every issue as it relates to freedom and equality as it comes up. The issue up for debate today is gay marriage. \n \n \nI've heard the \"anarchy\" argument made against same-sex marriage.\n\n \n How so?\n \n \nAgain, you are using the same sort of arguments that opponents of same-sex marriage sometimes use.\n\n \n How am I doing that?",

To him are they married.\n\n \n \n It goes along with the conservatives view of God to them; God is this angry Vengeful creature that has to be feared and obeyed or he will kill you.",

   "O i get it. Its ok for heterosexuals to act out our lusts but its not ok for homosexuals I got ya now.\n\n \n Well, the real question is, are you going to abide by what the Bible says as a Christian (and agree it should be abided by) or is it ok to not obey the Bible just because someone desires to do differently? Is it to be obeyed, or are situational ethics called for? To answer your question--yes, that's exactly right. If you want to accept what theh Bible says. If not, that's your choice--no one is going to make you obey or acknowledge it.\n \n \n \nAnd for those alcoholics they aren't born wanting to drink. They begin drinking socially and it turns into an addiction. Your saying that being an alcoholic is a genetic trait.\n\n \n A gay person isn't BORN sexually desiring anyone either. There is evidence that in both cases, there is genetic disposition involved.\n \n \nAlso God cares just as much about your inner thoughts as he does your outer actions. As was quoted earlier on the forum Jesus said that thinking of and lusting for another women is adultery.\n\n \n Indeed! That's why it's probaby very hard for gay people who are trying to live a Christian life. They should be given a lot of support from other believers. Nevertheless, no matter why God has them living that burden, it doesn't mean they have a license to sin and live in ways everyone else can't.",

   "It's ridiculous to look at a book that is thousands of years old as the only source of information on sexuality, homosexuality, gender roles, politics and government, science, or almost any other topic.\n \n A commandment or religious dogma that gives orders to a gay person, is not understanding that gay person's sexuality. It's just giving an order to be obeyed. Why shouldn't a gay person act on his or her sexuality? Because the Bible says so, is the reason given. Could those who wrote the Bible understand sexuality and many of the other topics as we do today? No, they could not.\n \n We know that being gay is not just about behaviour. Gay people are not really straight people who act with bad behaviour, either. If you ask someone to not act gay, it's also going to make the person feel bad or guilty about his or her sexuality, which is what the action is based on. That sexuality is a part of a person, gay or straight, it's not just an action. Sexuality occurs in the brain. If your religion tells you this is just about behaviour, jyoshu or others, it is wrong. All the orders to obey don't change the fact that it is wrong. What kind of God expects his people to not learn and grow? Are we just to be spoonfed commandments and orders to follow for eternity, to never really understand ourselves or one another? Are we to only accept the information from one ancient book or from the right church, and we cannot explore beyond that?",

I dont want to force my views down anyones throat and if u read my posts, u will see that ive had an abortion which I assume the vast majority of christians believe is murder and Im very glad it was legal. It was a sin but Im glad I had that right to make that sin because now Ive repented and been forgiven but yet also I dont have the same burden that I wouldve had. You know I guess after reading your post, im on the fence again about gay marriage. On one hand I do believe what I wrote and that women are the perfect partners for men and that is the way God intended. I do believe that but at the same time just like with my abortion, I believe people should have a choice and at the end of the day, their relationship with God is personal and its up to God to judge us all. If gay marriage is a sin then the gay people that marry will have to deal with that on judgement day and maybe its not up to us to regulate it.",

Are the gay people being pressured to abstain because of guilt, which would undeniably be related in some way to their sexuality? Are they expected to never have sex, just because they are told to, and it is believed by some that gay people can just do that without much trouble, or are gay people expected to struggle and be in pain with this for their entire lives?
