   "Evening :)\n \n There are some very interesting responses on your webpage; most thought-provoking.\n \n One statement did rather leap out at me, however:\n \n \nEvery theologian, even every atheist, would probably agree with you that religions are based on faith. That is a starting point, like an axiom in mathematics. \n\n \n I could either agree or disagree on this point, depending upon what was meant by 'based on'.\n \n If you're talking about the initial spark that fired a religion - say, the belief in a narrative justification for a possibly coincidental event - then yes, I'd agree. I'd also point out that everything we broadly think of as 'scientific knowledge' ultimately began the same way: the belief (or at least suspicion) that some consistent mechanism links certain events. Whether you end up with science or religion depends entirely upon what you do next.\n \n At least one of the paragraphs on your page attempts to segregate on principle the scientific from the personal, mechanism from narrative, explanations from justifications. This is in my opinion a false separation. It is an entirely testable proposition that, for example, the meek shall inherit the earth, or that cheats never prosper, or indeed any consistent assertion regardless of whether it demands the universe uphold some narrative imperative. The impersonality of science has emerged, just like any other law or equation, from the process of performing science. It models the world mathematically rather than dramatically because that's what works.\n \n If, alternatively, you are claiming that religions are axiomatically based upon faith in the sense of faith being, to put it crudely, 'the point of' religion, I would strongly disagree, for three reasons:\n \n First, referring to the point made above, it is perfectly possible to scientifically establish universal narrative laws. They need only be testable and consistent. Thus a spiritual journey - the discovery of individual or collective purpose, say - can in principle be made without faith. I'm no bible scholar, for instance, but I don't recall any of the main protagonists needing to have faith in anything that wasn't fairly promptly confirmed.\n \n Which leads me to my second reason, namely that the faith upon which modern religions subsist is not the same faith of which they were born, upon which they are truly based. The primal faith of Religion was the same faith with which I turn the key in the ignition each morning - or better yet, the faith which prevents some people from walking beneath ladders or smashing mirrors. It was faith in appreciable, inescapable and more-or-less immediate consequences.\n \n These days, such faith is comparatively rare - and where it survives, it generally does so as the gaudy fair-weather bloom of a hardier, all but ineradicable growth of untestable beliefs beneath. Thus someone will maintain confidence in the healing power of prayer, for example, whilst placing the failure of such genuine, tangible events to affect the average in the realm of divine mystery.\n \n It is quite wrong, then, to suggest that faith - belief in the absence of proof - is axiomatic to Religion or even foundational to religions extant today. On the contrary: pure faith is - and not through choice - their last refuge.",

What should we do promote it? etc.\n \n Thank you in advance,\n \n Ludwik Kowalski (see Wikipedia)\n\n \n Greetings.\n \n The Bible says to be able to give a reason for our faith. Like science, we have evidence that substantiates what we believe. The historical accounts of the life of Christ, for example, were very carefully investigated and documented, i.e.\n \n \"...it seemed fitting for me as well, having investigated everything carefully from the beginning, to write it out for you in consecutive order, most excellent Theophilus; so that you might know the exact truth about the things you have been taught.\" (Luke 1:3-4) \n \n There are tons of scholarly works that also go into depth in researching the historical accounts of the New Testament. Unfortunately, many Christians and way too many rationalists don't carefully delve into the historical data to learn the truth.\n \n Many areas of science were started or brought to their initial heights by people of gaith - people who believed in a Creator God.\n \n Creation scientists and other biographies of interest\n \n Creation scientists and other biographies of interest\n \n 50 Nobel Laureates and Other Great Scientists Who Believe in God\n \n While there are conflicts between believers and non-believers, we also often see schisms between rationaists themselves. \n \n I believe in due time the reality of God will become evident in our base of knowledge, and eventually men of science will also predominately become men of faith.\n \n People just need to spend some quality time doing their research with an unbiased mind.\n \n http://www.amazon.com/Evidence-Demands-Questions-Challenging-Christians/dp/0785243631\n \n And finally, here's another excellent resource on the discussion of God and Science:\n \n http://www.godandscience.org/",
