But from what I've heard, these were two illegal columbian dope dealers, that were wanted by the police. Remember, were not talking about some nerd stealing money with a computer. We're talking about two illegal columbian drug dealers breaking an entering into a home and robbing it. Horn seemed like he was very fed up with the robbers. He thought they had no right to break into someone's house, which very well could've been his, and steal someone else's hard earned property.\n \n I don't think Joe Horn should've shot those men, however I don't believe he should go to jail for life for it. I also thought I heard on the tape Horn saying \"move and you're dead\". Apparently they moved, which meant they knew they would be shot if they tried to run with the loot.

Maybe the perps in this case would have gotten away, but they wouldn't be dead. Burglary is not a death penalty crime in the USA.\n\n \n \n I agree somewhat, but not completely. I'm far from being with the \"right on\", \"Horn for Sheriff\" mindset, there's a chance that there could have been a little prejudice involved, the way he described them as \"black\" in the first part of the call. It was a heat of the moment thing, he seemed to have made up his mind at the beginning that he wasn't going to watch them get away with it, and if his carrying that out was wrong, it was an impetuous wrong, not a calculating, cold blooded wrong IMO, and apparently in the opinion of a grand jury as well.\n \n Anyone who breaks and enters takes a chance on getting shot, it's just that simple. Any rational person knows that one who breaks and enters is likely to have a concealed weapon, and to try to analyze whether they do or not when considering taking action could cost the analyzer their life. If an unarmed person who breaks and enters doesn't realize that he is likely to be shot, his stupidity shouldn't require a society to bend over backwards to accommodate his mistake. \n \n The only alternative to this unfortunate event would have been if Mr. Horn would have stayed inside like he was told, and the thieves would have almost certainly gotten away. And they almost certainly would have robbed again, and they may have had enough money from this job to buy a gun. Chances are good that Mr. Horn did save a decent persons life. \n \n That he refused to obey the dispatchers orders to stay inside doesn't mean much to me at all. No one has ever told me that when 911 is called, the caller immediately surrenders his or her every freedom to an absentee commander at the other end of a phone line. No matter how much \"training\" they have, they can't understand what is going on at an emergency scene the same way as someone who is actually there. They can make good suggestions, but the caller has to make the decisions. \n \n Anti gun people dislike Americans like Mr. Horn, that's obvious from the liberal posters here, and it was obvious from the grilling that Diane Sawyer gave him in her interview with him on \"Good Morning America\". (I heard both the 911 call, and parts of Sawyers interview on talk radio, otherwise I wouldn't have even known about this) It's interesting how different types of shootings get different news coverage in the US. Post office shootings, school shootings, police shootings, shootings like this, all different coverages. \n \n He seems shaken by what happened, not proud of it, and when Sawyer was questioning him, he may not have had the presence of mind to defend himself as many believe he could have. I don't remember what his answer was when Sawyer asked, \"is there a moral to this story\", but in spelling it out in writing and having a few minutes to think it over, I would answer her this way;\n \n Yes Diane, the moral is that in many types of crimes, the police do not have time to respond effectively. As illegal aliens continue to enter the US, and as increasing traffic jams around all major US cities continue to hinder police response time, the problem isn't going to fix itself. A civilized society can take only so much unchecked crime. Citizens policing themselves often works, even if it does get a little messy sometimes. If the messiness is unacceptable to you, then you need to come up with a realistic alternative. There simply isn't one, in a free society.",

   "Perhaps the men were obviously dead after one shot.\n\n \n \n IIRC...shot gun. Close range.\n \n I covered this case as part of my job.\n From my perspective, Mr. Horn IS a racist, right winger, old fart who got fed up and let his temper take control.*\n His emotional based decisions were to KILL the criminals unless (like in TV shows) they immediatly stood totally motionless and patiently waited for the police.\n \n He REPEATEDLY refused to listen to a plea for him to wait until the police arrived and to NOT go outside.\n \n IMO, he put himself in a position of danger deliberatly. \n As for the officer on the scene...a plain cloths officer who waited in his car for back up...he stated the \"men who were killed received gunfire from the rear\" \n \n All that said, I believe 2 more sub-human pieces of trash are gone and see no problems with that.\n I believe Mr. Horn made a 'legalistic' use of the Castle Doctrins and other laws for TX. and, I salute him for that.\n My black heart yearns for a world where cunning manipulation and legalism rule the day.\n Because in such a world...all things are possible and provable in a court of law. And such courts are ruled by the wealthy and the whitey. Vital Pillars of The MAN's oppression system.\n \n \n *I deal with such people a lot. Just saw two tables full of them them this morning sipping coffee at a McDonalds as I wolfed down some pancakes.\n And, when I'm old, eliminate the 'racist' and replace it with 'pants-less' and I hope to be jus' like 'em.\n Well, at least some people who know me expect me to stand in my front yard waving a shotgun at the noisy kids and shouting at them while wearing nothing but a house coat.\n Maybe my state will have a castle doctrine by then...so when the lil rascles step onto my property and ask me what's the problem or that I speak a little more clearly...I can blamminate them all over the grass.\n \"They're coming right at us!\" -Southpark.\n \n \n \nHere's an excerpt from the transcript of Joe Horn's 911 call: \n \n Horn: He's coming out the window right now, I gotta go, buddy. I'm sorry, but he's coming out the window.\n Dispatcher: Don't, don't - don't go out the door. Mr. Horn? Mr. Horn?\n Horn: They just stole something. I'm going after them, I'm sorry.\n Dispatcher: Don't go outside. \n Horn: I ain't letting them get away with this s--t. They stole something. They got a bag of something.\n Dispatcher: Don't go outside the house. \n Horn: I'm doing this.\n Dispatcher: Mr. Horn, do not go outside the house.\n Horn: I'm sorry. This ain't right, buddy. \n Dispatcher: You're going to get yourself shot if you go outside that house with a gun, I don't care what you think.\n Horn: You want to make a bet?\n Dispatcher: OK? Stay in the house.\n Horn: They're getting away!\n Dispatcher: That's all right. Property's not worth killing someone over, OK?\n Horn: [curses]\n Dispatcher: Don't go out the house. Don't be shooting nobody. I know you're ###### and you're frustrated, but don't do it.\n Horn: They got a bag of loot. \n Dispatcher: OK. How big is the bag ... which way are they going?\n Horn: I'm going outside. I'll find out. \n Dispatcher: I don't want you going outside, Mr. Horn.\n Horn: Well, here it goes, buddy. You hear the shotgun clicking and I'm going. \n Dispatcher: Don't go outside. \n Horn: [yelling] Move, you're dead!\n [Sound of shots being fired]\n\n \n IMO, boldened statements indicate that Mr. Horn did Judge and did come to a conclusion of guilty (kinda hard not to) and was confrontational and rather than think about his own safety when the dispatcher said he could get shot, the 'wanna bet' retort indicated that he'd get the 1st shot off...because he intended to shoot at the slightest provocation.\n \n According to the Wiki entry on this case.\n Mr. Horn cited the pertient laws as justification to the use of deadly force.\n The ONLY reason someone would do this is to pre-empt calls for arrest/retalitory action IF/WHEN he acts upon said laws.\n \n While on the phone with emergency dispatch, Horn stated that he had the right to use deadly force to defend property, referencing a law (Texas Penal Code \u00a7 9.41., \u00a7 9.42., and \u00a7 9.43.) which justified the use of deadly force to protect property\n \n I do this ALL the time.\n I even did this about 3 years ago when I was being attacked. Cited, very loudly for the suspect and all in the vacinity, that if the suspect didn't stop, I was within my rights to use force to ensure they did. Repeated it 3 times too.\n \n \n...I'm gonna shoot, I'm gonna shoot.\" \n \n Dispatcher: \"I want you to listen to me carefully, OK?\" \n \n Horn: \"Yes?\" \n \n Dispatcher: \"I got ultras coming out there. I don't want you to go outside that house. And I don't want you to have that gun in your hand when those officers are poking around out there.\" \n \n Horn: \"I understand that, OK, but I have a right to protect myself too, sir, and you understand that. And the laws have been changed in this country since September the First and you know it and I know it.\" \n \n Dispatcher: \"I understand.\" \n \n Horn: \"I have a right to protect myself ...\" \n \n Dispatcher: \"I'm ...\" \n \n Horn: \"And a shotgun is a legal weapon, it's not an illegal weapon.\" \n \n Dispatcher: \"No, it's not, I'm not saying that, I'm just not wanting you to ...\" \n \n Horn: \"OK, he's coming out the window right now, I gotta go, buddy. I'm sorry, but he's coming out the window. \" \n \n",

I know those dispatchers are coached to ask questions and keep the caller on the phone, but I think this one could have done a better job.
