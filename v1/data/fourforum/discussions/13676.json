   "Senators Sanders is offering a Medicare for All amendment in the Senate. This time, he appears to have more support, namely from Brown and Burris (who are co-sponsoring) and Harkin, who has said he supports single-payer reform. \n \n It will be the first time single payer is voted on in the Senate. \n \n The article provides a link for writing into one's Senators through Physicians For A National Health Plan. You can also call your Senators' offices through this article and its links at healthcare-now.org.\n \n \nWASHINGTON -- Challenging head-on the powerful private insurance and pharmaceutical industries, Sen. Bernie Sanders introduced an amendment to the Senate health reform bill Wednesday that would replace the bulk of the Senate bill's language with provisions establishing a single-payer, Medicare-for-All program.\n \n Joining with Sanders, I-Vt., in co-sponsoring the measure, known as Senate Amendment 2837, were Senators Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and Roland Burris, D-Ill. Other senators, including Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, have previously declared their support for single-payer health reform. The vote on the measure could take place in the next few days.\n \n \"This amendment starts from the premise that health care is a human right, and that every citizen, rich or poor, should have access to health care, just as every citizen has access to the fire department, the police or public schools,\" a statement from Sanders' office said.\n \n The single-payer approach embodied in Sanders' amendment stands in sharp contrast to the reform models being offered by the Senate and House leadership and the White House. Those bills would enhance the central role of private health insurers.\n \n Sanders' amendment, on the other hand, would replace the present crazy-quilt array of for-profit insurers with a single nonprofit, public financing agency, thereby slashing administrative waste in the system and redirecting the savings to clinical care.\n \n Dr. Quentin Young, national coordinator of Physicians for a National Health Program, said, \"This historic move by Sen. Sanders and his colleagues - it's the first time single payer will be voted upon on the floor of the Senate - is yet another sign of the strong and growing support for an improved Medicare for All among the public and the medical profession.\n \n \"In contrast, the Senate leadership's deeply flawed bill doesn't expand coverage until 2014, would still leave 24 million uninsured, and would place no effective constraints on exploding costs,\" he said. \"Sanders amendment would cover everyone from the start and allow for effective cost-containment.\n \n \"Physicians and patients alike stand to gain enormously from the adoption of this measure,\" Young said. \"No effort should be spared to ask every senator to vote yes on Senate Amendment 2837.\"\n \n Sanders' measure, which is largely patterned after a bill he introduced last March, the American Health Security Act (S. 703), would cover all of the 46 million Americans who currently lack coverage and improve benefits for all Americans by eliminating co-pays and deductibles and restoring free choice of physician.\n \n Highlights of the amendment include the following:\n \n * Patients go to any doctor or hospital of their choice.\n \n * Comprehensive benefits, including coverage for dental, mental health, and prescription drugs.\n \n * By eliminating the high overhead and profits of the private, investor-owned insurance industry, along with the burdensome paperwork imposed on physicians, hospitals and other providers, the plan saves at least $400 billion annually - enough money to provide comprehensive, quality care to all.\n \n * Community health centers are fully funded, giving the 60 million Americans now living in rural and underserved areas access to care.\n \n * To address the critical shortage of primary care physicians and dentists, the bill provides resources for the National Health Service Corps to train an additional 24,000 health professionals.\n \n * The program is paid for by combining current sources of government health spending into a single fund with modest new payroll and income taxes amounting to less than what most businesses and people now pay for insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\n \n * While federally funded, the program is to be administered by the states.\n \n Sanders, who serves on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, is a longtime advocate of fundamental health care reform.\n \n To urge your Senator(s) to sponsor this amendment, go here.\n Find this article @http://www.commondreams.org./headline/2009/12/04-4\n\n \n Healthcare is a civil and human right in a sane, democratic society.\n \n YouTube - Bruce Springsteen - We shall overcome (Live)",

   "What appears (at a glance) to be the latest news through googling; reported @ Democratic Underground via CSPAN2 that Amendment 2837 for single payer was not on the agenda today.\n \n \nThe agenda of today's Senate special session on health care reform was announced at 12:30pm--debate nw/ equal time allotted to each party. Two amendments were to be voted on, one from Sen. Lincoln, and both w/ higher #'s than Sanders' 2837, but 2837 was not on the agenda. Reid said he would get to other amendments \"in numeric order\", but didn't explain why 2837 skipped. Coverage of the session continues on C-Span 2 this afternoon.\n \n Nelson is speaking in favor of passing a bill, says \"there will be 60 votes\", but says the bill \"can be improved\". He expects passage \"in a week\".\n \n This means that we can call our Senators once again Monday morning to urge them to vote for it. Two tollfree numbers are available for the purpose: 866-220-0044 and 800-828-0498.\n \n Cosponsors of the amendment are Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Sen. Roland Burris of Illinois.\n \n @http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=106x33855\n",

Get real.\n\n \n You are really a sorry crew. This man works hard and can't afford health insurance, let alone dental care. Many Americans are in the same boat, with health professionals comparing dental conditions in the U.S. to third world nations:\n \n \nOn the front line of healthcare debate\n \n Doctors and dentists providing free care at the Forum say there's only one difference with Third World patients -- in Inglewood, they speak English.\n August 16, 2009|STEVE LOPEZ\n \n \"Do you want to see the tooth?\" Dr. Mehrdad Makhani asked me Friday morning at the free clinic being staged inside Inglewood's Fabulous Forum. \"Come. I'll show you.\"\n \n Jenny McLean, 36, opened her mouth and Makhani aimed a little flashlight in there.\n \n \"You see here?\" he said.\n \n The area around a back tooth was red and swollen, and McLean's eyes were teary with discomfort. She'd endured the pain for more than a year because she's had neither insurance nor the money for a dentist since losing her job as a social worker.\n \n It was a story repeated hundreds of times last week at the Forum, where a nonprofit called Remote Area Medical had brought in volunteers to treat legions of the uninsured.\n \n \"Here, look at this,\" said Makhani, pointing to a second tooth that would have to be extracted and yet another that needed a root canal.\n \n Makhani pointed me to another dentist. \"Talk to him. He's worked in Brazil.\"\n \n That would be Joseph Chamberlain, a Westwood dentist who said he's done charity work in Brazil, but not in conditions like this.\n \n \"They have a nice system of public hospitals and clinics,\" he said.\n \n But don't patients have to wait for treatment?\n \n \"Yes,\" Chamberlain said. \"But not like this. Not for a year.\"\n \n Stan Brock, who founded RAM in 1985 to bring medical care to Third World countries, told me that in 1992 he began getting requests to do the same work in the United States.\n \n \"The people we're seeing here have teeth as bad as the people in the Upper Amazon,\" said Brock, who used to tangle with wild beasts on \"Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom.\"\n \n It would be nice if we could send Brock to the nation's capital and have him grab the vipers and hyenas by their necks until they work out a healthcare reform plan. But Brock has a better idea: The nation's leaders should instead come spend a day at one of his clinics and learn a thing or two.\n \n He pulled out a chart showing that at his last medical jamboree, in Virginia, volunteer dentists performed 4,304 tooth extractions in two days, among various other medical procedures.\n \n \"President Obama was just down the road somewhere a couple days later, talking about healthcare,\" Brock said. \"I think it would have been a lot more interesting if he came to our clinic.\"\n \n Eugene Taw, an ear, nose and throat specialist with the Buddhist Tzu Chi Free Clinic in Alhambra, was one of many Forum volunteers who has worked in other parts of the world. Yes, he said, there are far too many parallels between the uninsured in the United States and the residents of impoverished Third World nations.\n \n @http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/16/local/me-lopez16http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/16/local/me-lopez16\n\n \n You are the one who needs to get real, with people waiting an entire year in the U.S. to get into a free dental clinic. Are you even aware that there are oral infections that can travel to the brain and kill a person? That periodontal disease -- which afflicts a very high percentage of Americans, is also linked to higher rates of heart disease, among other killers?",

Ander Crenshaw\n\n \n \n And how about your teabagging guru, Dick Armey, and all the years he's been sucking the teat of the nanny state with his taxpayer subsidized government health plans?\n \n \n\n BILL MOYERS: Gingrich became Speaker of the House and Armey the House Majority Leader.\n \n But they did nothing about health care except let its costs soar while their corporate backers reaped huge profits. Since then costs have more than doubled and are escalating now at twice the rate of inflation. There were around 39 million americans without health care coverage then. There are more than 46 million now. \n \n And Dick Armey? He retired from his government job to lead an advocacy group called FreedomWorks, which aims to torpedo healthcare reform once again. Curiously, they refuse to disclose their corporate donors. They say they want to protect against \"aggressive attacks on companies who people have claimed are donors but aren't even donors.\" Got that? \n \n But here's the catch. Something these marchers who came to Washington at Armey's urging could hardly be expected to know. For most of his adult life, their leader has benefited from just the kind of government, tax-supported healthcare he's fighting to keep them from having, too. \n \n When Dick Armey taught economics at the University of North Texas for 13 years his health insurance was administered by the state and supplemented by the taxpayers. \n \n When he was elected to Congress, he was covered by the federal employees' health benefit plan. And when he retired from Congress eighteen years later, he was insured by that plan until he turned 66 and Medicare, another government program, kicked in. All the time he's been making some half a million dollars a year working for FreedomWorks and raking in lobbyist fees amounting to what he recently called \"a darned handsome pile of dough.\" \n \n You can't blame him for keeping his government health plan. It's great. It gave him a lot of options, dozens of private insurers to choose from, and with eight million members in it, the federal government's got the muscle to negotiate some of the best premiums and drug prices in the country. That's not all. Taxpayers subsidize these federal health insurance plans by as much as 75% of the premium cost. Beneficiaries -- including members and retired members of congress like armey -- pay their share of the premiums with pre-tax dollars. \n \n Not bad. \n \n Now get this: Dick Armey thought so much of that federal health plan - the cadillac of coverage --that he tried to keep it as his primary carrier, instead of that other federal program, medicare. \n \n Mr. Armey wanted an option. A government option. How about that? \n \n But he couldn't get out of medicare without losing his Social Security (they're hitched together -- you give up one, you give up both), so he's suing to divorce the two ... And now he says he's happy to buy his health insurance on his own - and why not? He's got that pile of dough. And there's the rub. \n \n Dick Armey is the epitome of those people with power and privilege who are insured against the vicissitudes of life, and want no government assistance for any suffering ... Except their own. \n \n And all those members of congress sitting there during the president's speech last week? Joe Wilson, included. They; too have Cadillac federal coverage subsidized by tax dollars. \n \n That's no lie. \n \n @http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/09182009/watch3.html\n \n\n \n The constant plaint of your shamelessly pathetic crew just doesn't stand up to the light of day, as when scrutinized for what you actually practice.",

   "British Pull Own Teeth\n The Raw Story | English 'pull own teeth' as dental service decays\n Brits resort to pulling own teeth - CNN.com\n Blimey, British pull own teeth in dentist shortage\n Sufferers pull out teeth due to lack of dentists - Telegraph\n Nationalized Health Care Is Like Pulling Teeth -- Your Own\n The British have had a nationalized health care system for decades, and almost as long a list of examples why it doesn't work. Three years ago, we discovered that hospitals in the UK threw out viable kidneys for lack of physicians qualified to transplant them. Now we find out that a shortage of dentists has led Britons to perform free-lance extractions to avoid an excruciating wait:\n \n A shortage of National Health Service dentists in England has led some people to pull out their own teeth - or use super glue to stick crowns back on, a study says. \n Many dentists abandoned Britain's publicly funded health care system after reforms backfired, leaving a growing number of Britons without access to affordable care.\n \n \"I was not surprised to hear those horror stories,\" said Celestine Bridgeman, 41, of London. \"Trying to find good NHS dentists is like trying to hit the lottery because the service is underfunded.\"\n \n The National Health Service provides care to the vast majority of Britain's people, often for free. Unlike doctors who work for the health service, dentists work on a contract basis and can leave whenever they wish.\n \n \n The situation shows what happens when government crowds out the private market, even when it allows some private participation. Most Britons, whose tax dollars fund the NHS, cannot afford to add private dental services on top of the burden. Thanks to so-called reforms, almost half of Britain's dentists won't take NHS patients, and the rest have either long waits or work too far away from the patients who need them.\n \n In a free market, the compensation for dentists would be set by market forces. Shortages would not long exist, because any shortage would make dental services more valuable and would incentivize more students to pursue that specialty. As with the transplant surgeons, shortages occur because government caps compensation and removes the incentive to specialize at all -- and with dentists, who can opt out of the NHS system unlike their physician colleagues, the private market becomes exclusive to only those who can afford both the tax burden of NHS and the fees for dental work. \n \n What happens then? The rich get dental work. The poor buy pliers and Super Glue. Actually, I could be wrong. The poor might borrow the pliers.\n \n Six percent of the survey sample treated themselves out of frustration, including one man who extracted 14 of his own teeth. Twenty percent of the sample could not afford dental services. An additional 35% blamed their lack of dental care on a lack of NHS options close enough to them. That means a majority of Britons have no practical access to dental care, thanks to their government-run health care system.\n Captain's Quarters\n Patients pull own teeth as dental contract falters | UK news | The Guardian\n sound familiar?

   "The latest on activities around Senate Amendment 2837, i.e. demonstrations on behalf of Medicare For All on Human Rights Day:\n \n \nBodies Delivered to Senate Offices for Human Rights Day\n Friday, December 11, 2009\n \n Washington, D.C. - On International Human Rights Day, Dec. 10, 2009, health professionals and patients delivered \"bodies\" to selected Senators to make visible the number of people who die in the Senators' home states because we do not have Medicare for all.\n \n As part of a national day of action centered on health care as a human right, dozens of health professionals and patients gathered at the Hart Senate Building in Washington, D.C. yesterday morning. The day was sunny but very windy, which made it challenging to hold the large banners which stated: \"How many must die for insurance company profits\" and \"Medicare for all saves lives.\" Activists also held signs declaring that \"Health care is a human right\" and \"Single payer now.\" They chanted and sang as passing cars honked their support.\n \n Following the spirited rally, the activists entered the Senate building to visit 26 Senators and present them each with a letter that requested their support for Senate amendment 2837. The amendment, co-sponsored by Senators Brown and Burris, would substitute single payer financing for the current senate health legislation and would create a federal health system, administered at the state level, which would be universal, comprehensive and financially sustainable.\n \n The letters were attached to the backs of large cutouts of bodies, much like the chalk outlines seen at a murder scene. The number of adults who die each year in that Senator's state was printed on the front of the body with the words that there would be this number of fewer deaths if we had a Medicare for All health system.\n \n Some of the senate staffers reacted strongly to the appearance of the bodies, which was the intention. It is imperative that members of Congress and their staff understand the magnitude of suffering and death that would be prevented if they took steps to pass Medicare for all.\n \n Senator Reid's Deputy Chief of Staff, David McCallum, met with the delegation that brought the body to his office. The group implored Mr. McCallum to, at the very least, give the majority of Americans who support Medicare for all the right to have S.A. 2837 debated on the floor of the Senate.\n \n Serendipitously, the Mobilization for Healthcare for All was contacted by the daughter of Senator Phil Hart, for whom the building is named, on the day before the rally. She stated that International Human Rights Day was also her father's birthday and that he would have supported single payer, as she does.\n \n The movement for single payer continues to grow and become more visible daily. It is unacceptable that at least 120 people die each day in the United States from lack of access to health care. This magnitude of suffering and death does not occur in any other industrialized nation.\n \n We must continue to demand that the voices of the majority of people in America, including the majority of health professionals, who support Medicare for all are heard by the members of Congress not just on Human Rights Day, but every day. \n \n Join the Mobilization at Mobilization for Health Care for All | Patients not profit! | and let your voice be heard.\n \n @http://mobilizeforhealthcare.org/2009/12/11/bodies-delivered-to-senate-offices-for-human-rights-day/\n\n \n For the record, though I posted this before, I \"speak\" for myself only, as an individual, on this board. No one tells me what to say, nor do I \"speak\" for anyone else. Whatever some try to make up about me, because they have no argument, just character assassination, along with their other sorry attempts to intolerantly stifle free speech. \n \n Also on December 10th, in health care, and in Kansas City, a massive turn out of thousands of Americans for free medical and dental care.\n \n As the writer in the article says, what other advanced industrialized country needs a mass free clinic for the uninsured?\n \n See it on The Ed Show here speaking to a volunteer physician and at the link at huffpost, as Ed Schulz invites our U.S. Senators to come and spend some time at a free clinic with real Americans needing healthcare, and while they debate the bill; also on Keith Olbermann.\n \n Obviously, our senators are out of touch with America, as a number of posters on this board are, too. Yeah, debate it in a clinic, fellas! \n \n The event is one of a series of health care fairs put on by the National Association of Free Clinics. Though, as the physician points out, in her interview with Ed, this is hardly a comprehensive solution to a complex problem facing our nation. \n \n Health care is a civil and human right in a sane, democratic society. Open up Medicare for ALL!\n \n \n And Happy Hanukkah!\n \n \n \n ..",

And, as a general rule, you do not liberate people by occupying their country.\n \n Besides, how many Afghan women will be paid Robert Gates \"competitive\" salary increase?\n \n Read this from Maureen Dowd, since you're not a misogynist, \"baby\":\n \n \nPuppets just aren&#8217;t what they used to be.\n \n Or maybe a trillion dollars doesn&#8217;t buy the same felicitous level of obsequiousness it once did.\n \n Visiting Afghanistan and Iraq in an attempt to shore up our wobbly wards, Bob Gates could not seem to get the respect due the man running the world&#8217;s best military, a force that has been protecting and propping up our two occupied territories for most of this decade.\n \n At a joint press conference Tuesday at the presidential palace in Kabul, Hamid Karzai surprised the usually unflappable Gates when he knocked down President Obama&#8217;s attempt to get out of Dodge.\n \n Needling his American sugar daddy, the Afghan peacock observed: &#8220;For another 15 to 20 years, Afghanistan will not be able to sustain a force of that nature and capability with its own resources.&#8221;\n \n Gates and Obama may have wanted to &#8220;light a fire,&#8221; as Gates put it, under the corrupt Afghan president and warn that the A.T.M. is closing, but Karzai called their bluff. He knows, as do the leaders in Iraq and Pakistan, that America is stuck bailing them out with billions every year, even when they dawdle, disappoint and deceive.\n \n Gates and his generals in Afghanistan talked a lot last week about &#8220;partnering&#8221; with and &#8220;mentoring&#8221; the Afghan Army and police. But given the Flintstones nature of the country, it&#8217;s more basic. Americans have to teach the vast majority of Afghan recruits to read and write before they can get to security training. It&#8217;s hard to arrest people if you can&#8217;t read them their rights and take names.\n \n It seems late to realize this, but Gates told reporters he had only recently learned the &#8220;eye-opener&#8221; that the Taliban were able to attract so many fighters because they paid more. Generals in Afghanistan said the Taliban dole out $250 to $300 a month, while the Afghan Army paid about $120. So Gates has made sure that recruits get a raise to $240.\n \n The American solution is always to throw more money at a problem; now we&#8217;re in a bidding war with the Taliban, which doesn&#8217;t bode well for the democracy manqu\u00e9.\n \n Gates promised that America would not leave until the Afghan and Iraqi forces stand up &#8212; even when he gets stood up, as he did by Nuri Kamal al-Maliki Thursday night.\n \n The Iraqi prime minister blew off a planned meeting with Gates because he was in a scorching closed-door six-hour meeting with Iraqi lawmakers, being taken to task for his failure to stop five bombings that ripped into government buildings Tuesday, killing 127 people and wounding hundreds more.\n \n The defense secretary&#8217;s aides tried to spin the snub, noting that their guy was merely an appointed official while Maliki was an elected leader. When the prime minister finally agreed to reschedule the meeting for 7:50 a.m. Friday, Gates&#8217;s aides gleefully noted that, given Maliki&#8217;s preference for sleeping late, it was a diplomatic triumph, even if the Iraqi had on pajamas under his suit.\n \n After four days of preaching a message of love &#8212; Gates said it was &#8220;a myth&#8221; that America likes war and called it the first time in military history that an occupying force was in Afghanistan &#8220;on behalf of the Afghans rather than to conquer&#8221; &#8212; he finally got some back.\n \n &#8220;You look very young &#8212; you look much older on TV,&#8221; Maj. Gen. Turhan Abdul Rahman, the leather-clad Kirkuk provincial director of police, told the manicured Gates.\n \n If Rummy had been dissed by our inglorious glove puppets, he would have blown his top. But the disciplined, analytical, pragmatic, introverted Gates is no Rummy (nor does he call his predecessor). His form of ego is not to show ego. When a much-anticipated trip to see an Army Stryker brigade in Kandahar was canceled because of fog, he dryly told us: &#8220;As Clint Eastwood said, &#8216;A man&#8217;s got to know his limitations.&#8217; &#8221;\n \n The Cold Warrior who helped persuade the Reluctant Warrior to do the Afghan surge has sometimes been on the wrong side of history &#8212; with the Soviet Union, the Iran-contra scandal and the 1989 desertion of Afghanistan.\n \n But unlike Rummy, Cheney and Wolfie, he doesn&#8217;t seem driven to make up for past disappointments by manipulating present history. &#8220;Where I do think I bring something unusual is, I think I have uncommon common sense, whether it&#8217;s growing up in Kansas or just my life experience,&#8221; he told me, sitting in The Silver Bullet, a secure Airstream trailer on his C-17 that looks like a big toaster oven.\n \n Asked about the Democratic lawmakers who felt the president had been rolled by the generals, Gates snapped: &#8220;That&#8217;s ridiculous.&#8221;\n \n So how does Gates make a decision that will determine his reputation and that of the young president he serves?\n \n &#8220;Anybody who reads history has to approach these things with some humility because you can&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Nobody knows what the last chapter ever looks like.&#8221;\n\n \n \n That's not a good enough argument. And we have too many Americans at home who need health care.

   "The socialist house of cards is beginning to fall apart thanks to an unlikely player, Joe Lieberman(I). \n \n\n Senate health bill unlikely to include Medicare buy-in\n DEMOCRATS SET TO SCALE BACK\n Insufficient support for public-option alternative \n By Shailagh Murray and Lori Montgomery\n Washington Post Staff Writer \n Tuesday, December 15, 2009 \n Senate Democratic leaders appeared poised Monday night to abandon efforts to create a government-run insurance safety net in their push for health-care reform, as they attempted to close ranks around a bill they hoped would win the backing of all 60 members of their caucus. \n Democratic negotiators had already disappointed liberal lawmakers by jettisoning a full-fledged public insurance plan a week earlier. Last night, party leaders conceded that a key portion of the compromise they crafted to replace the public option -- a proposal allowing people as young as 55 to buy into Medicare -- also did not have sufficient support from Democratic moderates to overcome a likely Republican filibuster. \n Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), after consulting with senior White House officials, rallied his caucus in a closed-door meeting Monday evening, reminding senators that there was broad consensus behind most of the provisions in the $848 billion package and warning them of the consequences of not passing a bill before the end of the year. \n \"Democrats are not going to let the American people down,\" he told reporters after the meeting. \"I am confident that by next week, we will be on our way to final passage.\" \n The full contents of the legislation probably will not be known until Tuesday, at the earliest, when the Congressional Budget Office is expected to provide an official cost analysis. \n \n Senate Democrats will head to the White House on Tuesday afternoon to meet with President Obama. The Medicare buy-in proposal, announced last week by 10 moderate and liberal Democrats, was applauded by Obama as a worthy effort but received a cool reception from a small but crucial bloc of Democratic senators who have not committed to supporting the bill. \n On Sunday afternoon, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (I-Conn.), whose vote is needed to break a GOP filibuster, appeared to deal the proposal a mortal blow when he told Reid he would not support any form of buy-in. \n Reid and other Democratic leaders were furious with Lieberman, but his announcement forced a quick resolution to an issue that has clouded the health-care debate from the outset. Liberal lawmakers in both the House and the Senate have insisted on a public option as a way to force competition in marketplaces with few private insurers. But conservatives in both chambers are just as strongly opposed to the idea, seeing it as an unwarranted expansion of government that would squeeze private firms out of business and potentially leave taxpayers on the hook for the care of millions of people.\n \n \n",

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. &#8212; Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.

   "An introduction\n I am a chimney sweep I have been unequivocally for HR676 and would support the Sanders bill. I speak for no one but myself.\n I will admit, much of what I learn is from personal experience. I have experienced first hand what harm, and at considerable cost, what abusive governmental policy, financial institutions \"do as they please\" usury, and the health insurance industry (and other corporate posers) can do to the working poor. I will speak primarily of the health insurance industry here, although the reader is advised that they will be hard pressed to find anyone as disdainful to large corporations, big brother government and gigantic financial institutions as I am. I have no disrespect and have a full understanding of why anyone would hesitate to support what they would see as a possible takeover of health care by big government and therefore be confused by the support and even obviously the campaigning, for what they see to be exactly that which I support, I would like to try to address that.\n Before I do that, I would like to give a bit of background on the health insurance experience I have had. I have carried health insurance since 1976. The first 20 years it was subsidized by the government aka my employer the USPS. I paid 1/4 of the premium. The last 13 years I have paid for all of my own premiums out of money from our small family chimney sweep business. I have paid $100,000 in premiums (or very close to it, $78,000 since 2001) since becoming self employed. I received no help from my employer. I have seen a pattern by insurance companies of raising rates 20-25 percent a year for people in small group plans provided by the insurer. I have seen how if after 3 years a person who is in good health can easily find a plan much lower, which will then raise 20-25 percent a year until the policy holder decides to get a different policy. I have also seen that if something happens, for instance, an unknown spot in lung becomes a previous condition even if it is asymptomatic, a new policy is not to be found through any other company, and the rates for the policy holder will continue to raise 20 percent or more a year forever, until the policy owner can't afford it any more. It is a systematic weeding out of those who actually need health care. This happened to me. \n \n I have paid up to 1/3 of my income in any given year to insurance companies, you know, being responsible and all. There have been years when my entire medical expenditures were less than a months premium. Busy season for a chimney sweep comes in the fall. There is a season of scarcity and a season of harvest. In the fall a sweep works long and hard. A year ago I was working with the goal of catching up on property taxes on my house. When I couldn't pay, the state sold someone someone my taxes at 25 percent interest a year. If I don't catch up with interest, the tax buyer gets the house. State does not allow payments either. All taxes and interest have to be paid at once. The amount owed raises exponentially. Might not be all my fault either. I was paying my sick and aged mother a substantial amount of money so she could live in an assisted living home. My goal therefore was to pay that back, hopefully have a little money saved for Jan, Feb, months little money comes in. I worked 26 straight days at one time and caught the flue in Nov. I did not recover completely, continued to work outside, carrying ladders, climbing roofs and attempted to sleep while sitting up at night because I couldn't breath at night until finally a year ago Dec 15, short of reaching my goal, I breathlessly stumbled into the hospital, with 20 lbs of excess fluid and a heart functioning at 1/4 capacity and was diagnosed with Congestive heart failure. The doctors tell me to go on disability if I wish to live. Hmm. I must say, it was a good thing I had health insurance although with no money, and an inability to work it becomes apparent quite quickly that my 100,000 dollars spent for insurance over the years is only as good as next months 900 dollar payment. Not only that, I owe the hospital 3000 dollars I can not pay. Sweet.\n I must admit, I awaken at night worrying about what will happen. This is personal for me and from a personal standpoint I have to say, this really sucks and I have/had insurance.\n Not really feeling abused here though. There are 47 million who don't. .\n \n I would like to present this for consideration. Although my passion may come from my situation, I believe my argument is sound.\n \n Remember, I have already said that I have no disagreement with anyone not wanting to automatically give the government more control and therefore questioning HR676 or 2837, if that is what they take it to mean. If this is someone's position. I respect it. I do think this position is missing some important connections and information that once discovered may change some people's minds. It may not be as much a capacity to comprehend, as it is in maybe the way the truth is obfuscated to all of us I will do my best to present my case the way I see it.\n I want to make it clear that I am speaking for myself. I am unequivocally for single payer in some form. I am 100 percent sure it would be less government, although much more visible than what we have today.\n It seems to me that any Empire worth its weight in salt, must be able to manipulate the population to its own desires. This can be through deceit, bribery, fear tactics, creating apathy, controlling of funds, dividing the people, all tools are at its disposal. If I would design a nice little workable empire designed on world domination, I would need a good war machine. I would have to find a way to provide for such a machine. I would need to have people willing to risk and potentially sacrifice their lives and be trained to kill the \"enemy\", willingly if possible.\n \n \n I would also have to provide for the production the equipment needed for war making. I would use the carrot and the stick, however if I could use the carrot without the public realizing it was being manipulated to my ends, so much the better. Misinformation to divide, confuse and conquer segments of the population would be necessary. Having a unnoticed controlling bank to make monetary policy beneficial to my wishes would be necessary.\n To fight continually my necessary little wars for expansion or a major one, I need recruits. I can invent enemies and entice some good hearted patriotic individuals, but I would also need to give my recruits who perhaps would not be willing to sacrifice so much for nothing but pride, a gift, perhaps some would call it a bribe. I say this not in any way to offend anyone who has chosen to join the service for any reason. I will say it does have some perks, especially to the struggling. The GI bill was created in the 40's. It in effect gave every GI who was or ever would be in the service, practically free health care for life, as well as money for schooling or a new house when service was completed. It separated them from others in that regard. Pretty good deal for a few years of giving your life to the military if you come out alive. Makes it look appealing. I question the premise that no universal health care can be provided to a country before they stop war. I think as good of an argument could be made that if universal health care was provided to everyone, a very important carrot would be taken away from the military recruitment.\n Now that I have my soldiers, I need to have equipment. I need to have domestic workers, but the workforce is depleted because so many are soldiers. What do I do? I put price and wage controls on every single business and person (civilian) in the country. However, I create a loophole for the large businesses who are doing well because I am buying my war machines for my little Empire from them. I make them my partner. I lead more workers to them by giving them (the producers) the ability to give the gift of health insurance for their employees. I do not make these corporations pay any taxes on the money paid for their part of the health insurance. I do not make the workers receiving this health insurance pay for what in reality is a raise in income. Most small business or individuals can't afford this but they are not of service to me anyway, but the large companies with government contracts can because I make the money, I pay them, I give them tools to recruit workers because I want the tanks and guns and ships and ammo. I don't give any tax free deals for the people who have to buy their own insurance. Workers can hardly be blamed for moving (as I conveniently herd them where I want them) to the only job that gives them such a good deal and effectively are now entrenched in my war machine. They are also in a difficult position even if they morally disagree, being for all practical purposes dependent on their employer for their health. Who in a hundred would give that up? This would expand my war making empire, manipulate labor into making the empire's toys for battle and in effect separate them from other workers economically. My policies I create would financially benefit my warriors and give lucrative contracts and wealth-fare to the \"corporations\" It would give me another ally as well. It would create or completely reinvent another small relatively exclusive business and turn it into growth industry. The health insurance companies would propel in growth directly due to government policy I have enacted. I would of course frame it in the best possible light, in a way that all would think I have the best interest of all in mind. Now both the workers in the large corporations doing my work, and the soldiers are separated from the rest of the people by easier access to healthcare. This is exactly what our government did in the 40's and those same loopholes have continued to do for 60 years. cont\n \n Over 70 percent of all health insurance today is through an employer due to government policy. This is manipulation after 60 years.\n Can you imagine anyone ever deciding to give 100 dollars to a business in exchange for them giving you 70 of it back in actual services when you need it like health insurance companies do, especially if it were needed for your health care? If everyone had to buy the product themselves how would you ever market it if the costs were not subsidized and divided by government policy among the government, the employer and the holder of the policy like it is today? My opinion is not that which has been stated many, that going to a government controlled plan like hr676 or 2837 is just as bad as a corporate controlled plan. That view contends that going to single payer would actually be trading corporate for government. My position is that everything we have today is a government empirical controlled plan in complete cahoots and with preferential treatment going to the corporations. It is not a choice of one or the other, it is a total government manipulation we have today right now. It divides those who happen to get subsidized insurance through employers, or the service from those less fortunate. From that (my) world view, and realizing that there are a few congressmen left who do not believe in empire, do not believe in endless wars I appreciate them. These are some of the same in congress who tried to put a universal health care bill up for debate a bill that simply abides according to the mandates given to congress in section 8 of the Constitution that states that taxes can be collected for the public welfare, (as opposed to just about everything else our leaders pulling) they want everyone to have access to health care out of public funds and with very little intrusion from government to determine where one goes to get it, seems like a mighty step back for governmental and corporate control which we have today and a relief for me Knowing this though, it is no wonder the other members from both parties who prosper from the insurance industry wanted to squash it without a debate and did. (676) A bill like that would remove class divides among citizens at least in a most basic level of access to health care, thus it takes away Empires power (to bribe with health care) in both veteran benefits and it ends corporate health wealth-fare and would free up workers to not stay with an employer for only health insurance, and it would end the government made health insurance industries ability to get filthy rich from a scamming a pathetic product that serves no purpose . It treats all equally in at least one regard. No other plan will do that. It would save lives. \n Thanks for letting me ramble here. I hope it caused someone to at least look at something in a different light. In any case, my experiences with health insurance along with my health condition makes this important for me to write, perhaps vent. Perhaps I will quit obsessing and concentrate on getting next months health insurance premium.",

   "A nice summary following Senator Sanders' attempts to introduce Senate Amendment 2837.\n \n \nThe Unacceptable Senate Bill\n By Matthew Rothschild, December 16, 2009\n \n Howard Dean is right: Let&#8217;s ditch the Senate health care bill.\n \n Without a public option, and without a Medicare buy-in for people 55 to 65, the bill doesn&#8217;t do nearly enough.\n \n A better approach, as Dean suggested, would be for the Senate to take up the House bill and vote it up or down under the rules of reconciliation, so that only a 51 majority is needed.\n \n But Harry Reid isn&#8217;t up for that. Nor is the Obama Administration.\n \n Let&#8217;s remember how we got in this fix.\n \n Barack Obama and Rahm Emanuel bollixed this thing from the start.\n \n Instead of proposing their own plan, they tossed the whole ball to Congress.\n \n They took single-payer off the table. (Senator Bernie Sanders, to his great credit, took to the Senate floor on Wednesday to propose a single-payer amendment. See Home: U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (Vermont).)\n \n They didn&#8217;t even propose Medicare for All Who Want It, even though 60 percent or more of the American public want it.\n \n Instead, they continually pooh-poohed the public option.\n \n And they focused all their political attention on Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins, and now the execrable Joe Lieberman.\n \n They could have chosen a different path.\n \n They could have insisted on Medicare for All Who Want It, and they could have rallied the American people to come to Washington and lobby their legislators for it.\n \n In short, they could have used a grassroots strategy of empowerment.\n \n But they opted for a Washington strategy of appeasement.\n \n And so, as Governor Dean realized, we&#8217;re left with a very unacceptable outcome.\n \n Postscript: On December 16, Sen. Bernie Sanders wanted to introduce the first single-payer health care legislation ever to be discussed on the floor of the Senate but Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma forced the Senate clerk to read the entire 767-page amendment out loud, thus bringing all Senate work to a halt. Coburn crowed about this on his website.\n \n After a couple of hours, Sen. Sanders pulled his amendment so the Senate could go back to work. muchmore@http://www.progressive.org/wx121609.html\n\n \n The only thing I'd disagree with the writer on, is the part about the Senate getting back to work.\n \n Considering that 3 presidents are allegedly supporting just the public option, have control over Congress, and 75% of the American people behind them on the public option, and over 50% of Americans saying they're less likely to vote in the next election without a public option going through, including 1/3rd of Democrats, not to mention -- a widespread voters' mandate on public healthcare -- I don't think they're working nearly hard enough.\n \n From the great state of Vermont, hear a wonderful 3:01 excerpt from Bernie's speech on the Senate floor.\n \n \n \n ...",

   "Mark Warner isn't up for reelection....he just got elected! He was a great governor but he has caved fast to the liberal stranglehold. I've meet Warner a few times and so far he has been a disappointment. We thought we would get the Governor Warner we had earlier...how do you think he won by so much!?\n \n Look for Jim Webb to bite it in 2012 though.\n\n \n Oops. Wrong senator. Thanks for the correction.",
