   "There are from 2 to 5 thousand of them in Germany. The official figures vary but number of Chechens here is definitely rising. Still we don't know who they are as a people. They say Chechens are all terrorists and criminals. Not all of them are looking so at least. Those ones long living in Europe look civilized but their mindset is alien cause. I've got to mix with some of them in business. Well you can't rely on them 'cause they are somewhat prone to lies and cheating. Their ways especially in family life are somewhat different from ours in Germany, their women's status you know and so on. \n In their native lands in Chechnya itself and nearby they are much worse living life of real cavemen in their villages or life of wolves in the terrorists' camps in the mountains. My former university fellow now a freelancer specializing on reports from the Caucasian region says Chechen terrorists are wandering for months in the mountains making outings to kill and destroy. Interestingly, on his recent visit to Georgian capital city of Tbilisi he saw \"N2 world terrorist\" Chechen warlord Basaev. A year or so ago he interviewed the man and knows how he looks like. Basaev caught my buddy's eye when he was beating up some Georgian military officers just in the centre of Tbilisi in an open-air caf&#1081;. The scene was disgusting but it didn't last long and Basaev was quick to leave. My friend tried to sort it out with the officers. But they were reluctant to be interviewed for obvious reason. One of them explained \"those were old sours\". The name of a Georgian autonomous region Abkhazia was also mentioned. My friend's guess is that Basaev had had some combat encounter with those Georgians in Abkhazian armed conflict or sort of that.\n Well, that story was to be continued here in Germany when my buddy was surfing the Net. Again this was a clash between Basaev and this time another Chechen Zakaev by the name (he's kind of political rep of Chechen fighters in Europe). Zakaev posted info on Basaev's spring tour in the Caucasus. The latter accused him of lies and branded him \"national traitor\" and all that.\n They are very different, those Chechen \"reps\" living in safe European environment and \"Chechen rebels\" staying in the wilderness of the Caucasus. I get the impression the gap between them widening. Though there may be no gap far as their attitude towards outer world is concerned. In their perception Europeans are all \"infidels and of second brand\". I gather many of them are just looking civilized but are as wild as Basaev in spirit.",
