   "This article mostly concerns Senator Obama's position on driver licenses, in context of the Kennedy endorsement. But I am posting it because United Farm Workers already endorsed Senator Hillary Clinton, and the article includes comments by Dolores Huerta on the two candidates:\n \n Huerta, a longtime Latina activist and co-founder of the United Farm Workers union, scoffed at Obama's credentials with Latinos. Clinton worked in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas as a young woman, she said, while Obama was missing in action during two major activist events in Chicago, once when Elvira Arellano sought church sanctuary to avoid deportation, and another time when two Latino men were falsely accused of murder.\n \n \"He's now trying to build a relationship, but it's just not there,\" Huerta said. In Nevada, casino workers dubbed themselves \"Hilarios,\" she said, meaning Hillary supporters. \"This came from the people.\"\n \n With Obama, she said, \"A lot of them would say, 'Se\u00f1or como se llama?' They didn't know Obama's name.\"\n \n Latinos also trust Clinton, Huerta said. \"Support for her is not just support; it's enthusiastic support. In fact, I haven't seen anything like this since the Bobby Kennedy campaign back in '68.\"\n \n http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2008/01/29/6713/",
