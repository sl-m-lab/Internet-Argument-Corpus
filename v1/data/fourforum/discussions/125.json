   "Ok. First of all I'll withdraw the first statement of my first post for the time being. I thank falling and thistownwilleat for watching my tail, so to speak, LOL!! :D Point well taken guys. Of course men weren't created to kill. \n \n So I'll leave that aspect out for now. How about my other points? Frankly, one should NEVER change anything in one's method of defense unless it improves the mission... I submit that allowing women in combat does NOT improve the mission. It complicates it, and I don't believe that is an idle statement. Ask our Armed Forces if it doesn't complicate things. I know that right now we can afford to degrade the armed forces to some extent, but that is a common peacetime deception. While not fighting we should concentrate on being ready, not catering to the ideas of a special interest group. \n \n Not so long ago a survey of our women in uniform was conducted. A great majority of enlisted-grade females said they would refuse a combat assignment! (a smaller percentage of women officers said the same thing.) It's ok to be in the military in peacetime, the military's a free ride! But then in wartime, they want out. Not that I blame them. But this cannot be what we rely on for the security of our nation and it's interests. \n \n I will also point out that having women in the military actually serves as a \"deterrant factor\"... not a military one mind you, but a deterrant to signing up. Recruiters are having a hard time meeting quotas in all branches, and young men are electing to not go into the Service because of the admission of women. I speak from experience. That 1 of 2 major reasons why I chose to not join up. \n \n \n The correct question is, \"WHY should we allow women in combat?\"",

   "If any of a woman wishes to risk her own life she may, but when she put the life of another in undo danger because of your choice that is a problem. There are two major drawbacks to putting women in combat situations:\n \n First. A man in the trenches can look left and right at other men, shake their hands, and say \"You cover my back and I'll cover yours\" and without thinking twice about it step out into the battle fray. But you put a woman in the mix and you instantly deprive the group of its ability to perform at full capability. When a woman is present in a combat situation it is a natural instinct in men to protect her, even if it costs them their own lives. Therefore by placing women in a combat situation you not only endanger her life, you also unnecessarily endanger the lives of the men around her.\n \n Second. If a woman were to join the military right now, and be deployed to Iraq, she would again be placing the people around her in undo danger, simply by her presence. Islamic nationalists predominantly populate Iraq, and as such they will not surrender to a woman. We saw in the Gulf War that because of the presence of women in the trenches the enemy refused to surrender, and we lost \"many a good man.\"\n \n I agree that \"[i]f we have another soldier out there who is metally and physically capable of serving this country it is a plus [sic],\" but I do not believe that \"it is a plus\" if that soldier unnecessarily endangers the lives of the others out there. If you want to complain about \"equal rights\" go ahead, but I am not going to sit silently by and watch the death toll or our armed forces rise because y'all say that \"equal rights\" are more valuable than human life. \n \n As I said in another post (on the old site), \"I do not question your patriotism or dedication to our great nation, but I have a problem with someone who wants to use war for their personal gratification...I am not against women fighting, but fight in the air, on the home front, or a vast number of other arenas.

I actually was refering to physically handicapped people, not mentally handicapped people. The majority of men can make it, the majority of women cannot, and that's not just my opinion. No one here (I hope) is going to suggest that the average woman can equal or outperform (physically!!) a male soldier. \n \n Debategirl, you are the first person to give me the benefit of a doubt in my debates here, for which I'm grateful. However, I still have to disagree. There is no \"right to combat.\" the defense of our nation should be gone about in the most buisnesslike manner possible, and that does not include catering to individuals. If we re-raised the standards, how many women do you think would actually get in? the majority of women who could make it are professional athletes, and they aren't about to risk their life on the battlefield. It would then cease to have any reason for continuing, except the fact that feminists (I'm not accusing anyone here, thankyou) would really like to see women performing in all positions occupied by men. Including combat. Such interests cannot be reason enough for us to change our defensive policy. We've fought every war (except the Gulf war and the other quasi-conflicts since) without the aid of women in combat. Why should we change now? How all of a sudden did women gain a right to combat?",

How exactly does that work? Is that kinda like being an armchair quarterback? Maybe you should go serve in the military before you offer up opinions about what being in the military is like, eh?\n \n I can't help but notice that you say \"yet\". What does that mean? That you're like 15 years old? Do you think that being a kid gives you all the insight you require about what fighting men are thinking on the field? Or even what women are like? Where did said experience come from? Video games? Internet message boards? I dare say you don't know much at all about being a soldier, from both a lack of experience and a lack of life experience.\n \n You say below that you \"know many women\" who believe as you do.

I think the majority of people against women in combat are men. And certainly the majority of people who think women are weak and helpless are men! Why would women believe such a thing?\n \n I never said \"all men\". If it applies to you, it applies to you. If it doesn't, it doesn't. But saying \"men\" is certainly approriate.\n \n I think that if you ask around, you'll find that the women who are against women being in combat are really against being drafted. Newsflash: the draft and being in combat are two separate issues. And it's irrelevant anyway since most of the western world has abolished the draft anyway. Why do you think the armed forces advertise so heavily on TV? Find those women you talk about who say women shouldn't be allowed in combat, and ask them if they really mean they don't want to be drafted. You'll get an eye opener.",

You'd like the wimminfolk around to clean up after and feed the men in this real man's army! Gotta let them in the military for that, right?? They can serve their country by cooking and cleaning and playing nurse!\n \n You have no proof whatsoever that having women in combat will be detrimental. On the contrary, we have proof that women in fighting roles are performing their duties with excellence, and the men aren't having a problem with their own performance. Right now in Iraq, female apache pilots are shooting Iraqis. Female sailors are firing missiles and firing deck guns. We've even had the Iraqis capture a female POW now. And it's working! They're serving in dangerous roles right alongside the men, and it's working. How does that jive with your theories about women in combat?\n \n Will you just say that frontlines combat is \"different\"? Well, guess what? There is no evidence to support your theory.

It doesn't take a genius to see that you are indeed saying women are inferior, not \"different\" as you tried to claim above.\n \n And what is it that makes you think that men were created to kill each other? And that women can't? What about men makes them better able to kill, and women less able? Throughout nature (and humans are no exception), females are every bit as physically able to kill as males are. If you don't believe me, go observe what happens when you abuse the wrong woman, or abuse the wrong woman's children. The fact that she probably needs a weapon to kill you is absolutely irrelevant, since the last time I checked, field soldiers were issued rifles and bayonets.",

I don't think that just because we are women that we are \"inferior\" and can't perform the same way. I don't think that just because we are women, we should be allowed into the military for a limited purpose. It sounds to me that some of these guys think that we should be pregnant, and walking around the kitchen in our bare feet. I don't think so! If we meet the same standards and can perform the same duties efficiently, then why the hell can't we serve our country right beside them?\n As for me, I am in the military, and during training, the females were held to the same physical standards as the males. We met the same standards and passed the same tests and can perform our duties just as well, if not better, than any male. \n This country, The United States of America, is my country.

His ignorance is showing. Minute for minute, a penis is every bit the liability out there. A penis in combat suffers from yeast infections, infections from sand in the foreskin, abrasions, impact injuries, and want to know the biggest liability? This next problem is the single biggest health risk that faces every single army in the history of man: Venereal disease. Simple proven fact, men cannot keep their penises in their pants, and end up infected by the local CIVILIAN female population. STDs in wartime FAR FAR FAR exceed injuries from combat.\n \n And you know what? The overwhelming percentage of those treated are male soldiers, not female. Your marine buddy up above sorta forgot to mention that, didn't he? The amount of time the military spends treating STDs in wartime makes the amount of time spent on female hygeine absolutely insignificant.\n \n Women are already in the field, and have effortlessly proven your marine friend's assumption false. We don't need douche trucks and tampon deliverymen out there. The problems your poster was talking about haven't been proven out by experience. He's just flapping his gums.\n \n Now let's get to his assumption (and yours) that men are created to be women's protectors. I'm reminded of a famous quote by a WOMAN who won the medal of honor in the civil war:\n \n \"You men are not our protectors... If you were, who would there be to protect us from?\" - Dr. Mary Edwards Walker\n \n Think about that for a second, will you?\n \n The idea that women shouldn't be in combat because there will be complications from \"being surrounded by horny young men all the time\" is simply absurd. What are you implying? That women in combat will be raped by their own countrymen? Sure, it's possible. But that completely invalidates your idea that men are obsessed with protecting women, doesn't it?\n \n \n \nOriginally posted by Patriot \n \n A quote from Anita Blair, chairman of the Congressional Commission on Military Training and Gender-Related Issues in 1994:\n \"As a result of my work on the commission, I became convinced that the objective for many who advocate a greater female influence in the armed services isnot so much to conquer the military as conquer manhood: They aim to mak the most quintessentially masculine of our institutions more feminine.\"\n \n I concur. \n\n \n Well whoopdedoo for you.

Before training, less than 25 percent of the women were capable of performing the tasks. By comparison, 90 percent exactly matches the number of male trainees unable to pass these physicals.\" - senior analyst Everett Harman, US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine at Natick, MA\n \n I concur.

   "Originally posted by Truth Seeker \n Sure, but first I would like to ask you several questions if you don't mind. :D\n \n Since you were in the military at one time, I would be interested in knowing the following: \n \n 1) When you served, did you ever hold a position of authority? For example, you were promoted to a certain rank that required others to follow your orders.\n \n\n \n Of course I did. Hardly anyone who served a full term managed to do so without being promoted to a position of authority. I dare say you would have look very hard to find anyone who served in the military who never achieved any authority.\n \n That said, I enlisted as an officer. I had my college degree, and after attending OCS I earned a commission. If that's not authority, I don't know what is.\n \n \nOriginally posted by Truth Seeker \n \n 2) If you didn't serve as any kind of authority figure, who were your commanders? Were they mostly men or women? (I am guessing they were mostly men since there are more men in the military at present, but you never know.) \n\n \n It's not quite as black and white as you're presenting here. I was both in command and had soldiers under my command at the same time. It was always such. It is always such for anyone except the absolute lowest rank soldier, a private E-1. Both the soldiers above me and below me in the chain of command were mostly men. That should come as no surprise to anyone, since most of the military is mostly male.\n \n \nOriginally posted by Truth Seeker \n \n 3) If/ When you had women commanders were they treated with respect by both the men and women under them?\n \n\n \n This isn't Star Trek or M.A.S.H. You don't treat your superiors with respect, you go to prison. If you think otherwise, you've been watching too many movies and too much TV. Of course female commanders were treated with respect, and their orders were followed. To do otherwise is insubordination, the equivalent of a felony under military law. \n \n If you were looking for a situation where soldiers don't listen to female commanders, like I said, you've watched too many movies and too much TV.\n \n \nOriginally posted by Truth Seeker \n \n 4) If/ When you had men commanders were they treated with respect by both the men and women under them? \n \n \n See Above.\n \n I can't help but notice your signature. What are you, Patriot under a different username? Bad show, Patriot. Sock Puppets aren't good debate form.\n \n Patriot-- \n \n About your statement that you've been vindicated. I hope you're just fooling around. :)\n \n TruthSeeker's first post doesn't even belong in a debate forum. She stated an opinion, and then stated absolutely nothing to back it up in any way. No evidence. No reasoning. Not one \"because\". Nothing. It was like entering a presidential candidate debate and saying, \"I think the other guy sucks\" and leaving. Hence why I asked her as politely as possible to elaborate.",

The morale of men is much easier to keep up than that of women.\n \n\n \n Can you cite any evidence of that whatsoever? It sounds like an opinion to me. Opinions don't really have any merit here, do they?\n \n \nOriginally posted by Truth Seeker \n \n Physically, the majority of men have more strength and endurance than women do.\n \n\n \n You're half right. Men generally have more strength. However, women have more endurance. Test after test done by the military bears this out. Take a man and a woman in equivalent physical condition, and the woman lasts longer. It has to do with fast vs slow twitch muscle structure.\n \n I'm in no way advocating the use of lower physical requirements for women. However, if you read an earlier post of mine, you'll see that the head of physical testing for the army himself admits that 90% of women he worked with were able to meet the physical requirements standards to enter a combat unit after proper physical training. \n \n 90% That's 9 out of 10 females meeting the MALE physical fitness requirements for entering a combat unit after proper physical preparation.\n \n Read that one more time, please, because it clearly contradicts what you're implying above. Women are able to meet the current physical requirements for entering a combat unit. If a woman can meet it, I say let her in. If she can't, then don't. Same standards as for men.\n \n \nOriginally posted by Truth Seeker \n \n Morally, it is wrong to have men and women use the same sleeping, washing, and living facilities. I believe that there are same-sex barracks, but I don't know that it is the general rule. Does anybody know?\n \n\n \n You didn't really go there, did you? You're arguing about the morality of sexual population in the midst of murder, pillage, plunder? Are you serious? You're really worried about the moral standing of people's souls because of seeing each other naked while they're KILLING EACH OTHER WITH WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION? That doesn't even make sense to me. How can you be worried about men and women seeing each other naked when they're all there for purpose of murdering other people?\n \n But to answer your question, the military segregates male and female like it was a kindergarten class. It's severe separation. The only time you find men and women sleeping together in the military (apart from sexual trysts) is when they're married. Unmarried male and female soldiers are not allowed to cohabitate. So you have no worries there.\n \n \nOriginally posted by Truth Seeker \n \n Also women going into combat face the possibility of becoming POW's. If men are treated cruelly as POW's, just imagine how a woman would be treated. Remember that women are not held in very high regard or with any respect in many countries of the world. \n \n\n \n Go to your history books, and turn on CNN. Women have been taken as POWs in every recorded war in history. And you know what? The vast majority aren't treated any differently than the men. We can see this in current events as well. Ask the women who just came home from being POWs in Iraq if they were raped and whatnot because they were women. They weren't, and that speaks for itself.\n \n Can you provide evidence to the contrary? I think you should try, since all the current evidence is supporting me and contradicting you.\n \n \nOriginally posted by Truth Seeker \n \n Speaking from a religious point of view, men are leaders and protectors. Women help men to be more effective in everything that they do. This in no way implies that women are inferior beings. Men and women have \"different\" roles. \n \n\n \n Christian beliefs have no place in government. Principles such as The Golden Rule that Christianity was founded upon certainly have a place, but they existed before Christianity existed, and as such are irrelevant. Read your constitution. Using religious beliefs as a way of establishing doctrine in the military is expressly forbidden, and as such completely invalidates the point you made above.\n \n \nOriginally posted by Truth Seeker \n \n The issue is not whether women are capable of being in the military or capable of fighting. The issue is whether or not it is a good idea to make an exception to the rule. Should we allow women in the military because some women meet all the physical and mental requirements to join? \n\n \n I hope I've cleared this point up for you. Women who want to fight aren't asking for special standards. The simple fact (and remember who said it, a male high mucketymuck doctor in the army's medical branch) is that women are capable of meeting the physical standards set for men for combat units. I know I met them when I was in the military. I wasn't in a combat unit (obviously), but it's simple enough to compare the results from your fitness tests to a combat unit's standards.\n \n I think you should look into exactly what the standards are. You'll be surprised. You might even be shocked. Your average 18 year old scrawny 5'6\" 110 pound guy can meet them without a whole lot of preparation.\n \n \nOriginally posted by Truth Seeker \n \n Maybe they are capable, but they shouldn't, because when women become just like men and act just like men then all the refinery and femininity tend to go out the window. These niceties of life are what make life more pleasant. \n \n\n \n A woman can be a combat soldier and still be the feminine little flower you know and love. You don't have to be built like a professional wrestler to meet the standards. In fact, the standards aren't really any higher than the physical fitness tests you took in high school.\n \n Again, you've been watching too many movies. Women don't turn into that butch lesbian from \"Aliens\" when they get in shape for the military.\n \n Besides, women being able to enter combat units doesn't mean you have to do it. You don't even have to join the military, much less a combat unit. So why are you telling other women what to do? What makes you qualified to run their lives for them? Are they doing it to you?\n \n Women are asking for the option to fight for their country. And no, it's not special treatment. They're expecting to meet the physical requirements. Men are in no way required to join a combat unit when they join the military. They get to choose. Women are fighting for the option to choose as well. It doesn't affect you, or even most women. So why are you standing in their way? Why are you helping oppress your fellow women?\n \n \nOriginally posted by Truth Seeker \n \n The point is, is that men and women ARE \"different\". Hence, we are better suited mentally and physically for \"different\" occupations. \n \n\n \n I can't help but notice that the people who say what you just said always refrain from stating just which occupations you feel women are suited for. In addition, are there occupations for which women are suited and men are not? I tried to get Patriot to say, and he refused. Will you refuse as well?",

If you ever doubt that women are unable to handle violence, think about what you would do if you found a strange man in your child's bedroom late at night hurting him or her.\n \n \"In 2002, 16% of all violent crime was perpetrated by females\" - Washington D.C.: Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n \n Are you aware of Jessica Lynch's story? She refused to surrender until she ran out of ammunition, killing several Iraquis in the process. She survived her experience as a prisoner.

Can you please show me evidence that shows women were POW's from every recorded war in history as a result of deliberately going out and fighting in combat. \n \n\n \n The only way you ever get taken as a POW is by engaging in combat. Civilians are not counted as prisoners of war. Civilian prisoner counts are tallied separately. Look it up if you don't believe me. \"Prisoner of War\" applies solely to soldiers.\n \n Your criteria is more than a bit slanted, and I suspect you know that and are trying to be cute. It doesn't matter how you got into combat and got taken prisoner. You do not have to be in a combat unit to have combat find you and end up a POW. Ask the female POWs from the current war how they ended up POWs. As such, your question as asked doesn't merit an answer. However, I will list several wars who had female POWs for you. Listing them all would take more time than I could possibly have, but I'll list enough that you get the idea.\n \n I really think you should research this subject, as you may very well find it fascinating.\n \n History records female soldiers as early as 1300BC. \n \n Everyone from the Romans to the Native Americans to the Vikings, the Celts and the Gauls lists not only female combat soldiers, but female military leaders. Go look it up, it'll give you something to do while you sit at home waiting for your husband to get home from work.\n \n Now up to more current times...\n \n American Revolution: At one point, 66 field nurses were drafted into the infantry in desperation. The unit was overrun and many of them were taken as POWs.\n \n Civil War: Mary Walker, a Union Army surgeon, was captured and held in a Confederate POW camp for 4 months. She was awarded the Medal of Honor for bravery and valor later.\n \n WW2: 79 American female POWs were taken in the Phillopines. All 79 survived to be rescued 3 years later. Kinda puts a crimp in your idea that women can't handle such an ordeal, huh?\n \n If you really wish to learn more, I suggest you do some digging yourself. It's all there in the history books.\n \n \n \nOriginally posted by Truth Seeker \n \n First of all, Christianity was not founded upon the Golden Rule. It was founded upon Jesus Christ. (By the way, where is the Golden Rule found?) The point about the roles of men and women really is not wholly related to religion. It really is a fact. Your response to it really depends on your worldview. \n \n\n \n Are you so sure about that? The Golden Rule was indeed one of the principles upon which Christianity was founded, along with most other religions. It was not founded on Jesus Christ, as even the Bible (are you sure you read it?) will clearly show that Christianity existed before Jesus was born.\n \n History also shows that many of the religions that predate Christianity bear a suspicious resemblance to the things you find in the bible. Very little in Christianity was original when that book was written. Again, you don't have to take my word for it. Start studying ancient religions and see just how much of Christianity was borrowed from older, already existing religions.\n \n \nOriginally posted by Truth Seeker \n \n About different occupations for men and women and which are suitable, I don't want to go there.

Either I would be written off as having \"oppressive attitudes toward women\" or just an old-fashioned fuddy-duddy who has to be enlightened to the greatness that feminists have done to free women.\n \n\n \n Ahh. But if you yourself feel that your views are inapropriate, why do you espouse them here? Not a very good position to take in a debate forum. Perhaps you should stick to your knitting circles?\n \n \nOriginally posted by Truth Seeker \n \n However, I will tell you something about the occupations of women. Women should not be in the military, if they are married and have children they should not be in the public workplace, and if they are not married, they need to judge for themselves the wisdom of having a job in the public workplace. \n \n \n But women are in the military, and have been since the dawn of recorded history. The history of female soliders is vast and well-documented. Women WILL enter combat units, and there is little that you can do about it. Thankfully, your oppressive opinions are in the minority in today's more enlightened world.\n \n No one is telling you what to do with your life. You're completely free to be a barefoot and pregnant wimminfolk, serving the men's wishes. If that's what you wish, more power to you! I just wish you would wake up and realize that it's not right to force your lifestyle on others. The women wishing to enter combat aren't forcing theirs on you and I think you should think about that.",

[*]\u00b7 One female Marine complained that the 3-mile morning run was demeaning to women. The run had to be suspended pending an investigation.\n Military Morale\n [*]\u00b7 One instructor stated that it was his opinion as many as 60% of recruit graduates should not graduate . . . instructors are not allowed to fail or expel recruits who did not meet standards. Instructors are told to motivate those recruits who refuse to perform. Instructors are not supposed to verbally abuse trainees.[*]\u00b7 Gender integrated training appears to be contributor in the decline in military training and standards.[*]\u00b7 The military accepts pregnancy as an \"acceptable readiness problem.\"[*]\u00b7 Each year between 10% - 17% of women military personnel become pregnant BUT, depending upon other factors that number may be significantly higher.

Each must be accompanied by a battle-buddy as a witness.\n Physical Fitness Facts - Gender Studies(The Erosion of Military Effectiveness)\n [*]\u00b7 Women possess approximately half the strength of a comparable height/weight male.[*]\u00b7 Women have 30% less aerobic capacity.[*]\u00b7 Carrier Theodore Roosevelt: 45 of 300 women did not deploy or complete the cruise due to pregnancy (11 had to be flown off the carrier when underway). [*]\u00b7 Bosnia: 1 pregnancy every 3 days.[*]\u00b7 Women have twice as many sick calls as men.[*]\u00b7 When asked to carry 90 lbs of artillery shells: males failed 20% of the time - females failed 70% of the time.[*]\u00b7 When asked to march 12.5 miles while carrying 60 lbs of equipment followed by target practice: males failed 17% while females failed 48%.[*]\u00b7 Fort Jackson (Army) reports the frequency of lower body injuries among females (hip, knee, back sprains, broken ankles, etc.) is a serious problem. Also, each is accompanied by a battle-buddy during their convalescent time.[*]\u00b7 Previous 1-man jobs have had to be reassigned as 2-man jobs since single females are incapable of performing such jobs alone.[*]\u00b7 More weight had to be assigned to map reading and first aid so as to so that women would not fail in such high numbers.[*]\u00b7 The percentage of women soldiers being medically non-available at any time literally twice that of male soldiers.[*]\u00b7 1988 - 51% of single Air Force women stationed in Iceland became pregnant.[*]\u00b7 1988 - 48% of single Navy women stationed in Iceland became pregnant.[*]\u00b7 Bosnia, December 1995 - July 1996: a female military person had to be evacuated due to pregnancy every 3 days.[*]\u00b7 Natick, MA military laboratory study of women between ages of 18-35 who met normal physical standards for Army entry, including height/weight: women suffered 3 times overall injury rate AND twice the incidence of stress fractures in military training environment.[*]\u00b7 1982-1983 Military Study of 970 advanced graduates (completed boot camp): showed that all men could meet heavy lifting requirements whereas fewer than 15% of women could meet the same standards. Yet, many women are assigned heavy lifting status MOS (military occupational specialty). [*]\u00b7 Hospitalization rate of females is more than 10 times that of men with white females being more than 15 times that of the Army overall.[*]Women have a significantly higher rate of attrition AND women are not as profitable to train due to normal gender differences, injuries, pregnancies, etc.\n Marine Corps discovered: [*]\u00b7 Only 45% of female Marines could toss a hand grenade beyond its burst radius; i.e., women can't throw a hand grenade far enough to keep from blowing themselves up.[*]\u00b7 Only 12% of female Army recruits could throw a hand grenade beyond its burst radius.[*]\u00b7 Only 12% of Navy females can accomplish a 2-person stretcher carry.[*]\u00b7 Women can not change a truck tire without a man's assistance.[*]\u00b7 Women can fire field artillery pieces BUT they are incapable of handling the ammunitionWest Point Military Academy: Due to gender norming schemes  \n [*]\u00b7 Women receive A grades for the same performance that earns a male a D[*]\u00b7 Women perform 11% fewer sit-ups[*]\u00b7 Women perform 53% fewer push-ups[*]\u00b7 Women run 1.5 miles 27% slower than males\n Lt. Kara Hultgren, U.S. Navy pilot - killed October 1994 while trying to land her Tomcat fighter plane\n \u00b7 On approach to the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln, Hultgren made 5 major errors.\n \u00b7 Major Hultgren ignored repeated wave-off signals by the ship's landing officer.\n \u00b7 Major Hultgren's F-14A's left engine subsequently stalled, sending the plane out of control. (Hultgren mistakenly jammed the rudder)\n \u00b7 No Navy pilot had ever stalled an engine in this manner before.\n \u00b7 Major Hultgren had subpar performance during several phases of her pilot training.\n \u00b7 Major Hultgren had four downs (major errors) during her pilot training. Historically, two downs would have been sufficient cause to dismiss a male pilot trainee. The White House and Congress put political pressure to ensure more female combat pilots.\n \u00b7 During Major Hultgren's final training flying session crashed her plane into the sea while attempting to land on an aircraft carrier.\n \u00b7 Another female pilot trainee was allowed seven downs of which the last two were not even recorded on her personal record so as to ensure her graduation from pilot training.\n \u00b7 Double standards dumb-down all pilot training.\n \u00b7 Double standards undermine military morale and respect.\n \n Lt. Carey Lohrenz\n \u00b7 After Hultgren's death, Lohrenz was dismissed from further aviation training after her flying performance was described by her instructors as \"unsafe, undisciplined, and unpredictable.\"\n \u00b7 Instructors described Lohrenz as engaging in a\"high and fast\" landing technique, which \"scared everyone but her.\"\n \u00b7 Lohrenz has filed a lawsuit against the Center for Military Readiness (CMR) and Elaine Donnely (head of CMR) regarding her (Lohrenz's) dismissal from aviator school.\n \u00b7 Lohrenz alleges that the ensuing news stories about Hultgren caused her \"to lose confidence\" in her flying abilities and caused her colleagues to \"scorn\" her. \n It should be noted that the CMR report never identified Lohrenz by name. The CMR report referred to Lohrenz as 'pilot B'. It was later articles by the news media that identified Lohrenz by name. Lohrenz has subsequently named two newspapers in the lawsuit.\n \u00b7 The military conceded to Lohrenz; i.e., the Navy reinstated Lohrenz as a land based pilot. Elaine Donnelly says that this concession to Lohrenz \"overruled the first-hand judgments of a long line of instructors and superiors in the Pacific chain of command.\"\n \n \n Ok, maybe more than a FEW facts, but all ones that one should be aware of when deciding if women belong in combat. Quite plainly if someone can't throw a grenade out of the blast radius, is that someone you want standing next to you???",

   "Believe me, I am not Patriot under another name. :D\n \n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n Why shouldn't women be allowed into military combat?\n \n There are distinct physical differences between men and women. ( I hope we can at least agree on this point.) There are also distinct mental differences between men and women.\n \n I oppose women in combat for:\n 1) psychological reasons\n 2) physical reasons\n 3) moral reasons\n 4) religious reasons\n \n Psychologically, the majority of men are better able to take on antagonistic forces than women are. The morale of men is much easier to keep up than that of women.\n \n Physically, the majority of men have more strength and endurance than women do. \n \n Morally, it is wrong to have men and women use the same sleeping, washing, and living facilities. I believe that there are same-sex barracks, but I don't know that it is the general rule. Does anybody know?\n Also women going into combat face the possibility of becoming POW's. If men are treated cruelly as POW's, just imagine how a woman would be treated. Remember that women are not held in very high regard or with any respect in many countries of the world. \n \n Speaking from a religious point of view, men are leaders and protectors. Women help men to be more effective in everything that they do. This in no way implies that women are inferior beings. Men and women have \"different\" roles. \n \n The issue is not whether women are capable of being in the military or capable of fighting. The issue is whether or not it is a good idea to make an exception to the rule. Should we allow women in the military because some women meet all the physical and mental requirements to join? \n \n I would say no, because it is not a job that women should do. \n \n Maybe they are capable, but they shouldn't, because when women become just like men and act just like men then all the refinery and femininity tend to go out the window. These niceties of life are what make life more pleasant. \n \n The point is, is that men and women ARE \"different\". Hence, we are better suited mentally and physically for \"different\" occupations. \n \n \n Note: In many of my statements I refer to a general rule and not the exception. Keep in mind that there are always exceptions. However, I do not believe in \"rule by a few\", even though I am afraid this very often happens.\n well you want equality isnt that a b.......h! their shouldnt be any female boss,s because their not physically able to perform the job than . they shouldnt be able to vote either !they want the good things but dont want the responsability!if i take a bullit in combat because im a man and a women doesnt because shes a women thats not equality! thats reverse discrimination you gotta take the bad with the good!",

   "Ok, I just spent quite a while reading this entire thread...\n I can see the main arguements are coming from Patriot, and Silver as well as a few others. \n I'm with Silver for the most part. I'm 18, I'm female, I took the ASVAB and got a rather... HIGH score on it for what it means. (dunno if I can release that.. better not) I meet all of the physical requirements... and I'm now enlisted in the Marines. I took the test with mostly guys... and somehow managed to surpass the majority. Am I not qualified? I handle myself well in emergency situations. I'm very mentally alert. It's also been proven that women can concentrate on more things at once than guys can, for what that's worth.\n \n I signed that line for several reasons. \n I want to serve this country and give back what it has given me, if necessary. And what the hell, there are some guys out there who aren't qualified to, or simply won't. To Put it simply. Some men don't qualify, and some women do.\n My recruiter was a male. He seemed to have no problem with me being female and wasn't phased the least. Neither were all the other males that were with me when we were sworn in. I don't know why people on the field would feel any different. Then again, I don't have that experince. Help me out there, Silver. heh.\n As for male's protective instincts or whatever... what about female's protective instincts. Aren't they noted for being the more protective parent. Or maybe I was taught wrong. Whatever\n And seriously, how much of that protective instinct is going to be directed at just a female, rather than the rest of the fighters on the field? Are men just not strong enough to overcome that instinct and do his job? (Ok, that sounded really sexist, and I'm sorry, but it's a point) His job is to protect his country and fellow fighters, not a specific one. So then do the job.\n \n I'm beginning to convince myself that I'm really biased. wow. I'm just typing my thoughts though. These are questions I was never presented with before and got me thinking. I like that.\n \n Anyway, another reason I joined was because of family history. Many of my relatives (both male and female) were in the military, and when asked, say they wouldn't trade it for the world. I'm doing it because I want to make something of myself, my wheels are spinning, I'm not challenged, and I need something to motivate my life. What's better than serving my country?\n \n I also joined because even though I'm young, I know that wealth doesn't come in the form of money, it comes in the form of experince. Everyone I've talked to that's been in the military say that they now have a completely new, better outlook on life. I want that. I guess I think the services are just the way to go if you want a worthwhile experience. (once again, Silver, help me out there... is that anywhere near the truth?)\n \n So it's not just about fighting to me. It's about serving, it's about knowledge, it's about experience, and it's about pride (and I don't mean being conceited). So then why can't I join the Military?\n \n I'm not in it for that equal rights XXXX. I know many females (and yes, they do outnumber the males, but that's because society has shaped them to be so) that are NOT qualified. I am. So should I waste that qualification? I think I could do the country a service (and NOT hinder them... ) and I am determined to do so.",
