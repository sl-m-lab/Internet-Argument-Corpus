   "Here's more evidence of Obama's associations with long time committed COMMUNISTS since childhood. This evidence is offered by Accuracy in Media (AIM) I suppose you lefty's will question AIMs objectivity also, right? emoticon_rolleyes\n AIM Identifies Mysterious Obama Mentor As Communist Party Revolutionary\n \n PRESS RELEASE | FEBRUARY 19, 2008\n \n WASHINGTON, February 19, 2008 -- A mysterious friend and adviser to Barack Obama when he was growing up in Hawaii is identified in a new column by Accuracy in Media editor Cliff Kincaid as a member of the old Moscow-controlled Communist Party USA. \"Obama's communist connection adds to mounting public concern about a candidate who has come out of virtually nowhere, with a brief U.S. Senate legislative record, to become the Democratic Party frontrunner for the U.S. presidency,\" Kincaid writes in the column, posted on the AIM web site www.aim.org \n \n Obama's mentor \"Frank\" is Frank Marshall Davis, who was publicly identified as a member of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA). Obama, in his book, Dreams From My Father, refers to him repeatedly as just \"Frank,\" without a middle or last name. \n \n Kincaid explains, \"The reason is apparent: Davis was a known communist who belonged to a party subservient to the Soviet Union. In fact, the 1951 report of the Commission on Subversive Activities to the Legislature of the Territory of Hawaii identified him as a CPUSA member. What's more, anti-communist congressional committees, including the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), accused Davis of involvement in several communist front organizations.\" \n \n AIM recently disclosed that Obama has connections to the Democratic Socialists of America and that he sponsored a \"Global Poverty Act\" designed to send hundreds of billions of U.S. foreign aid to the rest of the world, in order to meet U.N. demands. The bill has passed the House and a Senate committee and awaits full Senate action.\n \n Accuracy in Media is a citizens' media watchdog organization whose mission is to promote fairness, balance, and accuracy in news reporting. Founded in 1969, AIM is the oldest non-profit press watchdog group in America. For more information, please visit www.aim.org. ",

As usual you attempt to intimidate by shouting down and insulting the opposition rather than directly answering the questions forwarded. \n You see child, wouldn't you agree that the political philosophy of the founder and promoter of any political system is very relevant in labeling what it is and what it represents? Then doesn't Stalin, who ruled the USSR from 1929-1953 take credit for establishing what the USSR represented throughout the entire Cold War? HERE is a link to Stalin's bio, and here is his MARXIST BEGINNING, Which formed his political beliefs for the rest of his life.\n Mini biography: \n 1894 - Stalin wins a scholarship to the Tiflis Theological Seminary in the Georgian capital, moving to the city at a time when the empire is racked by dissent and heading closer to revolution. Once resident in Tiflis he joins the city's Marxist underground and becomes a leader of a clandestine Marxist group at the seminary. However, when his revolutionary activities are discovered, he is expelled.\n Now little child, are you going to deny that it was marxism that formed what Stalin brought to the political table from his youth in seminary to the time that he took power in 1929, and until his death in 1953? And are you so ignorant that you don't understand that THE PRINCIPLES of marxism has been read, understood and corrupted from its original intent, in order to oppress and control the masses by more than one dictator? Like a roasted chicken, MARXISM has been picked over, consumed in part as men have taken what they can use to control the masses and attain personal power under the false banner of creating a peoples paradise where both work and wealth is equally shared. That is the great lie of Marxism that has led to so much human misery since a pure and undefiled marxist philosophy has never once been established anywhere on Earth. \n \n Are you going to now rephrase your diatribe above in order to make it sound like this is exactly what you were attempting to say in the first place? That's your M.O. after all. Well don't bother because this quoted post of your clearly shows how clueless and superficial your perspective is, and oh, wrong also. SINCE THE MAN CREDITED BY WORLD HISTORY WITH FORMING SOVIET COMMUNISM WAS AN AVOWED AND DEDICATED MARXIST!\n \n Of course if you were a mature adult, I would ask for an apology for the insulting invectives which you spewed, and for the wasted bandwidth due to the long drawn out emotional yet incorrect explanation in your attempt to wiggle out of your original spurious claim. But since you are an \"obvious child\", I'll expect no such maturity from you.",

As a result of Lenin's and Stalin's policies, many people came to associate the term communism with undemocratic or totalitarian governments that claimed allegiance to Marxist-Leninist ideals. The term Marxism-Leninism refers to Marx's theories as amended and put into practice by Lenin.\n \n And your only response is to insist that I DON'T GET IT??? What political philosophy are you suggesting guided him for the rest of his life, egalitarianism? Feel free to look that up, but you can be sure he never practiced it with the unwashed masses whom he oppressed and abused in his quest to maintain absolute power. \n \n The point is that no country has ever practiced true marxism but many have taken certain aspects from it only to create their own perverted form of communism from it. But you would have to actually be honest in order to admit that fact. So stop claiming that I don't understand communism, and stop claiming that you do if you're unable to #1, tell me what to call the USSR's political system, if not communist, and #2, what was Stalin if not a committed marxist from the age of 16 years old? Now do yourself a favor before you go off on me with your misdirected rage, because I'm not going to go around in circles arguing semantics with you about what an 8th grader should know from political science class.\n Communism, a theory and system of social and political organization that was a major force in world politics for much of the 20th century. As a political movement, communism sought to overthrow capitalism through a workers' revolution and establish a system in which property is owned by the community as a whole rather than by individuals. In theory, communism would create a classless society of abundance and freedom, in which all people enjoy equal social and economic status. In practice, communist regimes have taken the form of coercive, authoritarian governments that cared little for the plight of the working class and sought above all else to preserve their own hold on power.\n \n The idea of a society based on common ownership of property and wealth stretches far back in Western thought. In its modern form, communism grew out of the socialist movement of 19th-century Europe (see Socialism). At that time, Europe was undergoing rapid industrialization and social change. As the Industrial Revolution advanced, socialist critics blamed capitalism for creating a new class of poor, urban factory workers who labored under harsh conditions, and for widening the gulf between rich and poor. Foremost among these critics were the German philosopher Karl Marx and his associate Friedrich Engels. Like other socialists, they sought an end to capitalism and the exploitation of workers. But whereas some reformers favored peaceful, longer-term social transformation, Marx and Engels believed that violent revolution was all but inevitable; in fact, they thought it was predicted by the scientific laws of history. They called their theory \"scientific socialism,\" or communism. In the last half of the 19th century the terms socialism and communism were often used interchangeably. However, Marx and Engels came to see socialism as merely an intermediate stage of society in which most industry and property were owned in common but some class differences remained. They reserved the term communism for a final stage of society in which class differences had disappeared, people lived in harmony, and government was no longer needed.\n \n The meaning of the word communism shifted after 1917, when Vladimir Lenin and his Bolshevik Party seized power in Russia. The Bolsheviks changed their name to the Communist Party and installed a repressive, single-party regime devoted to the implementation of socialist policies. The Communists formed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR, or Soviet Union) from the former Russian Empire and tried to spark a worldwide revolution to overthrow capitalism. Lenin's successor, Joseph Stalin, turned the Soviet Union into a dictatorship based on total state control of the economy and the suppression of any form of opposition. As a result of Lenin's and Stalin's policies, many people came to associate the term communism with undemocratic or totalitarian governments that claimed allegiance to Marxist-Leninist ideals. The term Marxism-Leninism refers to Marx's theories as amended and put into practice by Lenin.\n \n After World War II (1939-1945), regimes calling themselves communist took power in China, Eastern Europe, and other regions. The spread of communism marked the beginning of the Cold War, in which the Soviet Union and the United States, and their respective allies, competed for political and military supremacy. By the early 1980s, almost one-third of the world's population lived under communist regimes. These regimes shared certain basic features: an embrace of Marxism-Leninism, a rejection of private property and capitalism, state domination of economic activity, and absolute control of the government by one party, the communist party. The party's influence in society was pervasive and often repressive. It controlled and censored the mass media, restricted religious worship, and silenced political dissent.Communism - MSN Encarta",

   "Yes, it is. Because that is what the evidence suggests. The US overthrew Allende precisely because they feared a vibrant socialist democracy in south america, and installed a brutal capitalist dictatorship in its place. \n\n \n I'm going to shock you now Jo, but I actually agree with you partially. I say partially because what Allende was creating in Chile was far from a vibrant socialist democracy. In addition to that, what Marx considered to be true Marxism was a complete Communist System, that's far different than a socialist democracy.\n \n But here is why I agree with you. It seems on the surface that Allende wasn't interested in becoming a dictatorial war monger and a tyrant over his people. It appears that he was attempting to institute a non aggressive socialist political system only, and had no desires to expand communism as a tool to control and oppress the masses. For that reason, I'm ashamed that the US instigated to unseat him while allowing a man like Pinochet to create a Police State which went on to oppress the people of Chile.\n \n I understand it was the Cold War period and we were dedicated to not allowing communism to take hold in South America. But Allende was hard to read also. Allende's socialistic ideology and friendship with Cuban president Fidel Castro made him deeply unpopular within the administrations of successive U.S. presidents, from John F. Kennedy to Richard Nixon; they believed there was a danger of Chile becoming a communist state and joining the Soviet Union's sphere of influence.\n \n Yet, here he condemned the Soviet aggression while formerly recognizing Communist China. \n \n  Allende publicly condemned the Soviet invasion of Hungary (1956) and of Czechoslovakia (1968) while he later made Chile the first Government in continental America to recognize the People's Republic of China (1971).\n \n I would like to think that had he and we communicated with each other, maybe a meeting of the minds could have allowed us to have a friend like him rather than ending up supporting the likes of a Pinochet.\n \n \nUS policies are not designed to benefit its people, they are designed to benefit the wealthy elite who make up both the political class and the CEOs.

The US was founded on the principle of making sure business owners could squeeze the last penny of profit without having to pay the real costs of their activities.\n\n \n This is nothing more than socialist propaganda that is finally coming true in America only because of the liberal socialist influences of this generation. This hasn't always been true of the American Republic for which I stand. It sickens me that I can't boldly proclaim that this paragraph just isn't true, and could never be true in my Country.\n \n \nIt is entirely consistent with this that the US cannot abide the thought of a system that genuinely allows an economy to be democratically controlled, and will use force (contras, school of the americas etc.) to achieve that goal.\n\n \n Here's where you lose me Jo. Your idea of a democratically controlled economy is one that is owned and controlled by the Government. I am personally opposed to any system that prevents property and business ownership and control by the people. You really use all of the leftist talking points that socialists and dedicated communists use. And that turns me off from the get go. But you have shown by using Allende as an example, that the USA made mistakes during the cold war and although we don't know what Allende would have become had he survived as President of Chile, there is no doubt how bad Pinochet was for the people of that impoverished and oppressed country under his control.",

There is no reason why an entire economy shouldn't run on this basis.\n\n \n Maybe so, but that remains to be seen on a massive scale. The point is, you used Allende as an example of a vibrant socialist democracy, and I dispute that as a factual statement for 2 reasons. #1) He never had time to see his plan through to completion so we could judge it on its long term merits. And #2) because he suffered internal opposition from various quarters within his own country.\n Main article: Chile under Allende\n \n Allende stamp from East Germany.\n Upon assuming power, Allende began to carry out his platform of implementing socialistic programs in Chile, called La v\u00eda chilena al socialismo (\"the Chilean Path to Socialism\"). This included nationalization of large-scale industries (notably copper mining and banking), and government administration of the health care system, educational system, a program of free milk for children (given out arbitrarily by GAP \"Group of Personal Friends of the President\"), and a greatly expanded plan of land seizure and redistribution (already begun under his predecessor Eduardo Frei Montalva,[11] who had nationalized between one-fifth and one-quarter of all properties liable to takeover).[12] The Allende government's intention was to seize all holdings of more than eighty basic irrigated hectares.[13] Allende also intended to improve the socio-economic welfare of Chile's poorest citizens; a key element was to provide employment, either in the new nationalised enterprises or on public work projects.\n Chilean presidents were allowed a maximum term of six years, which may explain Allende's haste to restructure the economy. Not only did he have a significant restructuring program organized (the Vuskovic plan), he had to make it a success if a Socialist successor to Allende was going to be elected. In the first year of Allende's term, the short-term economic results of Minister of the Economy Pedro Vuskovic's expansive monetary policy were favorable: 12% industrial growth and an 8.6% increase in GDP, accompanied by major declines in inflation (down from 34.9% to 22.1%) and unemployment (down to 3.8%). However, these results were not sustained, and in 1972, the Chilean escudo had runaway inflation of 140%. The average Real GDP contracted between 1971 and 1973 at an annual rate of 5.6% (\"negative growth\"); and the government's fiscal deficit soared while foreign reserves declined [Flores, 1997]. The combination of inflation and government-mandated price-fixing, together with the \"disappearance\" of basic commodities from supermarket shelves, led to the rise of black markets in rice, beans, sugar, and flour.[14] The Chilean economy also became the victim of a US campaign against the Allende government[15].\n The Allende government announced it would default on debts owed to international creditors and foreign governments. Allende also froze all prices while raising salaries. His implementation of these policies was met with strong opposition by landowners, employers, businessmen and transporters associations, some middle-class sectors like some civil servants and professional unions, the rightist opposition, led by National Party, the Roman Catholic Church (which in 1973 was displeased with the direction of educational policy[16]), and eventually the Christian Democrats. It also was a reason for growing tensions with foreign multinational corporations and the government of the United States.\n He also raised wages before the economy was able to sustain the added costs leading to high inflation.\n October 1972 saw the first of what were to be a wave of confrontational strikes. The strikes were led first by truckers, and later by small businessmen, some (mostly professional) unions, and some student groups. Other than the inevitable damage to the economy, the chief effect of the 24-day strike was to induce Allende to bring the head of the army, general Carlos Prats, into the government as Interior Minister.[14] Allende also instructed the government to begin requisitioning trucks in order to keep the nation from coming to a halt. Government supporters also helped to mobilize trucks and buses but violence served as a deterrent to full mobilization, even with police protection for the strike breakers. Allende's actions were eventually declared unlawful by the Chilean appeals court and the government was ordered to return trucks to their owners.[18]\n Throughout this presidency racial tensions between the poor descendants of indigenous people and slaves who supported Allende's reforms and the white settler elite increased.[19]\n In addition to the earlier-discussed provision of employment, Allende also raised wages on a number of occasions throughout 1970 and 1971; these wage hikes were negated by in-tandem inflation of Chile's fiat currency. Although price rises had also been high under Frei (27% a year between 1967 and 1970), a basic basket of consumer goods rose by 120% from 190 to 421 escudos in one month alone, August 1972. In the period 1970-72, while Allende was in government, exports fell 24% and imports rose 26%, with imports of food rising an estimated 149%.[20] Although nominal wages were rising, there was not a commensurate increase in the standard of living.Salvador Allende - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n So it seems that his program was failing due to the universal problems which always seem to lead to the failure of Socialism where ever it's attempted. Just look at Norway, Sweden and Finland, the most Socialist of the Northern European Countries with a non aggressive military infrastructure. look at how frail their economic balance was, and how they tumbled and immediately imploded when the world market experienced a radical adjustment a month ago. It was their socialist infrastructure which led to their inability to respond efficiently and effectively since they already have the entire economic weight of their countries on their governments shoulders. Socialism lacks flexibility and versatility where as Capitalism is built upon it since it allows the economy to eb and flow according to the needs of the consumer.",

   "The last time we had a Liberal as Prime Minister was just after WW1, when David Lloyd George held together a national government, mostly with tory support.\n \n People voting for Blair being a rejection of socialism doesn't hold a huge amount of water when the opposition weren't socialist - they were racist and avowedly capitalist, even more so than Blair. As for \"standing up to terrorists\", Blair's government was responsible for a NEGOTIATED settlement with the IRA that has led to them disbanding. It's one of the few good things he has done. The Good Friday agreement is a model for how to deal with terrorism everywhere, by compromise and by addressing the legitimate grievances that drive people to extremes. Blair did not bomb the Shankill Road and think that would stop the IRA attacks.\n \n If you think people supported Blair in 2005 because they liked the Iraq war you're crazier than I thought. \n \n Britain's deepest recessions occurred under monetarist economic policies in the early 80s and 90s, the tories are only just becoming electable again as people forget the mess they made. Unemployment soared past 3 million. There is no point in lowering inflation if it comes at the expense of people being able to feed and house themselves. The north of England has never recovered from Thatcher's demolition project. You want to talk about class warfare? Thatcher's stated goal was to smash the institutions of the working class so as to prevent them ever challenging the power of the employers again. This has led to a massive widening of inequality, and a collapse in social mobility. I'd like to see evidence that people are happier in Britain than they were, say, 35 years ago.\n \n As for Venezuela elections, how about the 2004 recall referendum? The Carter Centre report gives a positive, if imperfect verdict on the conduct of the election:\n The presidential recall process was a novel electoral\n event for Venezuela. The process suffered from\n some irregularities, delays, politicization, and intimidation,\n as described below. Nevertheless, we note it is\n important to distinguish between irregularities and\n fraudulent acts that could change the outcome of a\n process. It is the Center's finding that the official\n results reflect the will of the Venezuelan electorate as\n expressed on Aug. 15, 2004.\n http://www.cartercenter.org/documents/2020.pdf\n \n And no, I don't think capitalists think in terms of exploiting people, almost nobody thinks like that. That doesn't mean it isn't what happens. At worst they consider themselves to be \"looking out for number 1\", more usually they come up with self-justification about how hard they work. In extreme cases they'll attribute it to divine providence:\n \n The rich man in his castle\n The poor man at the gate\n God made them high and lowly\n And ordered their estate",
