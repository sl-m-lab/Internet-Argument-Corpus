Don't even try to pass that off on Bush 43, it is the inner cities now coming to grips with the fact that no other voice has been voted in - only democrats - and they are the living guinea pigs of neglect from the radical change in the direction of the DNC, no longer looking for their usual hand out mentality... they are social agitators now and have sold their souls to the next lowest common denominator - their mantra now is a moral shift in the laws of the land... thus the real problem with America... the \"progressive\" left.
