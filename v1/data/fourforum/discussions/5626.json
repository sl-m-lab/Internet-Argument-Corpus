   "I got to thinking about this while watching a program, on the discoverytimes network, about men entering the priesthood. Preists are married to the church and since the church is the bride of christ then by logic every catholic preist is involved a samesex marriage. Jesus was/is male so in way all catholics who oppose samesex marriage are hypocrits. If you broaden the scope, since it is scriptural and the church is the bride of christ, all christian males are in a samesex marriage with jesus. So in a way if it is good enough for jesus why is it bad for the rest of us? \n \n I Corinthians 12:27\n Ephesians 4:12 \n Rev. 21:2 \n Rev. 21:9 \n Rev. 22:17 \n John 3:29 Ephesians 5:25-28\n Revelation 19:7-9 \n \n I am using scripture to back up my claim about all christain males being in a samesex marriage with jesus. If evangelicals can use scripture word for word, and not the meaning behind the scripture, to condem me I feel very justified in using scripture word for word in proving my point. It says the church is the physical bride of christ. The scripture says nothing about spirtual forms.They can't or refuse to see the truth. Jesus was a man, he rose from the dead, hence he came back to life. He assended into heaven, hence he is still alive. The church is his bride. When you call yourself a christain you are part of the church. So male christain+church=bride of christ+ jesus male = married = samesex marriage",

Rather than fighing to mainstream itself into the status quo, the gay liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s focused more on highlighting and championing the differences between gay culture and the status quo (what some gay rights advocates contemptuously labeled \"straight culture\"). Consequently, it was not unheard of for these groups to take positions which gay rights groups today reject.\n \n Opposition to age-of-consent laws demonstrates the radical nature of many of these early gay rights groups. The 1972 Gay Rights Platform adopted by about 200 radical gay activists at a convention in Chicago held by the National Coalition of Gay Organizations (NCGO), called for the \"repeal of all laws governing the age of sexual consent\" at the state level.\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nambla)\n Sources for the above article:\n - Art Cohen, \"The Boston-Boise Affair, 1977-78\", Gay and Lesbian Review Worldwide, Vol. 10, No. 2.
