Please read it.\n \n \n Do you realise that ALL of our modern understanding of biology has been informed by, and only makes sense in the light of, evolutionary theory? If evolution id a 'fraud' and 'junk science' then so is ALL of modern biology AND medecine.\n \n Scientists do not work with preconceived goals in mind; no one is desperately trying to 'fix' the evidence to make sure a fraudulent theory retains its standing. If anything, if evolution was a fraud you can have no doubts whatsoever that there would be plenty of biochemists out there who would happily debunk it in order to make themselves the number one leading scientist in the field.\n \n Science is as competitive and ruthless as capitalism; if a theory is dodgy, there will be armies of people fighting to bring it down; if a theory is wrong, it will be discarded as emotionlessly as the market discards companies who provide poor service. Even with a heavily entrenched theory such as evolution, if it has flaws, they will eventually be uncovered.\n \n In fact the whole process of scientific investigation is geared more towards disproving hypotheses than trying to support them. It is the nature of a hypothesis that while it might make sense on its own, the facts which it purports to explain may be better explained by some other as yet unimagined hypothesis. For this reason the vast majority of experiments take the form of imagining how we can disprove the hypothesis, and then carrying out such tests to see if they do indeed disprove it.\n \n And when those tests suggest that something might merely be slightly wrong with a theory, that theory can be changed to accomodate the new results. Sometimes such changes are opposed by the theory's 'old guard' but the new FACTS always win through in the end; Einstein hated the idea of quantum mechanics but was forced to accept it in the end.\n \n We may not understand the origin of life (we have, however, pretty conclusively gone back all the way to before the 'DNA revolution', to the so-called 'RNA world' hypothesis), but evolutionary theory, as the change in allele frequencies in a population over time AND common descent over 3.5 billion years actually has more evidence in support of it than practically any other scientific field, in that all known facts fit with what evolution predicts.\n \n I will now lay out the major evidence in support of evolutionary theory. Thanks to 'Vicious Love' of Internet Infidels Discussion Board whose work I have shamelessly plagiarised. My apologies for the long post, but I rarely bother with the Evo/Creo debate because it's just the same old arguments over and over again, so this is kind of my definitive last word on the subject (even if it is somebody else's original words).\n \n Evidence # 1. The nested hierarchy of species. Now, remember how ToE says new species form. Each one branches off from an existing species. Therefore, ToE predicts that all species will be related to each other, and this relationship will be structured like an enormous tree, with smaller and smaller branches. Many of the main trunks and limbs may now be extinct, but if we find evidence of them (fossils) they should still fit in this pattern, and no other. And we have found that all 12 million or so known species, as well as all the extinct species we know about, are related to each other in just this way. Nor is this an artificial or arbitrary classification system, it is based on objective and measurable standards, and in particular on genetic relationships that can actually be seen in their DNA.\n \n Evidence # 2. Homologies. These are similar structures on different organisms. It's not just that they exist, just that many creatures have similar structures or features, but that they resemble each other according to their inheritance. I'll give an example: Bats, human beings, whales and moles are all mammals, and all descended from a common ancestor. All us mammals branched off from birds a long time ago. Bat's wings, human hands, whale flippers and mole's paws all have the same number of bones in the same arrangement. This is because we share a common ancestor, so that's what nature had to work with and evolve from. Birds' wings, on the other hand, use different bones! So even though bird wings and bat wings look alike, a bat's wing is actually more like your hand than it is like a bird's wing. ToE predicts this and explains why: it's because birds and mammals branched off from a common ancestor before birds developed flight. So, it's not just that creatures share common features, but the exact specific pattern of their similarities.\n \n Evidence # 3. Geographical distribution of species. This is a pattern that really helped Darwin figure it out. Again, you've continents, islands, etc. So say you've got a tropical island off the coast of a continent. What species do you find there? Do they resemble more the creatures on the adjacent continent, or the species on another tropical island on the other side of the world. It turns out that the species greatly resemble those on the adjacent continent, and do not resemble those in the comparable environment on the other side of the world, as evolution predicts.\n \n What you tend to find in these environments is a lot of birds, because birds can fly there. Some of these island environments have very limited species of land animals, and they tend to evolve to fill all the niches there are.\n \n For example Australia. Everyone knows there are no placental mammals on Australia. There are only marsupials and a few monotremes. There are a very few marsupials in the entire rest of the world, such as the possum. Why no mammals on Australia? Marsupials preceded placentals. Once placentals evolved, they tended to be more successful and replace the marsupials, which went extinct. Australia broke off from Asia before placentals evolved, so we still see marsupials there, but hardly anywhere else.\n \n I should also add that with ToE and other strongly grounded scientific theories, it's not the nested heirarchy, not the homologies or geographic distribution or vestigial features or DNA or the fossil record that really counts; it's the combination of all of these. When many separate lines of evidence all support the theory, and are all consistent with it and with each other, especially when they come from different fields, such as geology, physics, archeology and paleontology, that's called consilience. And that is what really nails a theory as being well-supported. We will see that ToE has very strong consilience, which is why scientists rank it as among the best grounded and most certain theories, along with gravity, electromagneticism, germs and so forth.\n \n Evidence # 4. Vestigial structures. Vestigial organs and structures are organs or structures remaining or surviving in a degenerate, atrophied, or imperfect condition or form. ToE predicts that organisms will retain abbreviated, ineffective versions of organs inherited from their ancestors. There are many of these. The point is not just that they exist, but that they always reflect their ancestral origins.\n A good example are the eyes of blind fish. These fish live in caves with no light, and cannot see whatsoever. Nevertheless they have tiny, buried eyes that fill no function but have not atrophied yet all the way into non-existence. ToE explains that the reason they have them is that they descended from sighted fish.\n Another nice example is that biologists believe that mammals evolved after life emerged onto land. Aquatic mammals such as whales descended from land mammals with limbs. So while whales do not have legs, they still retain vestigial hip bones. On rare occasions whales are found with tiny useless back limbs.\n \n Evidence # 5. The age of the earth. Evolution makes a prediction about it. Darwin realized from the beginning that for ToE to be correct, the earth had to be very, very old. At that time there wasn't enough data to know exactly how much, except that it would have to be very old. At that time and for the preceding 100 years, geologists had begun to realize that the earth was quite a bit older than previously suspected. (These geologists were all Christians, btw.) Between 1850 and 1900, they started trying to use the data they had to make some kind of estimate, data such as the proportion of salt in the oceans and so forth. The leading physicist of the day, Lord Kelvin, used Fourier's theory of heat conduction and innovative math to calculate the age of the earth, based on certain starting assumptions about the temperature of the earth's core and rate of heat conduction, and came up with 100 million years. 100 million years is a lot, but Darwin and his proponents knew it wasn't nearly long enough for ToE to account for the tremendous diversity and complexity of life on earth. Then radiation was discovered in the early C20th, and it ws realized that the earth had another source of heat energy, radioactivity in its core. So Kelvin's calculations were correct, but he was missing key data. Soon after, physicists realized that, because radioactive isotopes decay at a constant rate, the earth in effect had a sort of clock that could be used to calculate its age.\n \n Applying this method to meteorites (because all earth rocks have metamorphisized), geophysicist now estimate the age of the earth to be about 4.56 billion years old, which is plenty of time for the diversity of life to have arisen by strictly evolutionary processes.\n \n This method has been calibrated against several simpler measures, including tree rings, ice cores, and, most notably, lake varves. I like varves because they are so simple even I can understand them. It is observed that two layers of sediment form in lakes each year: a lighter layer in spring and summer, and a darker layer in fall and winter. These layers are laid down in the lake bed. Millions of years later, when the layers of sediment have hardened into sedimentary layers of rock, you can count them. So you don't have to understand any fancy physics at all, you just have to be able to count. When radiometric dating is calibrated against lake varves, they agree very well, verifying the theory of radiometric dating very well. All 4 of these methods are based on sound, simple bases, and all 4 correlate very well.\n \n Evidence # 6. DNA. When Darwin figured out descent with modification, he knew almost nothing about genetics. Although Mendel had begun his work it was not disseminated until much later. Darwin worked with pigeon breeders to understand that practical application of breeding. ToE predicts some kind of mechanism that would account for descent with modification. That is, people observed that organisms reproduce imperfectly, but didn't know why. ToE predicted that some kind of mechanism would be found that would explain HOW offspring come to resemble their parents, but not completely. Over the next hundred years, biologists discovered DNA and how it works. ToE did not predict the double helix structure, meiosis and mitosis, 4 chemicals, coding for proteins, etc. etc., just that there would be some mechanism that would account for these features in reproduction. Because of sexual combination, and mutation, DNA does completely account for this phenomenon.\n \n Once DNA was disocovered and understood, it lent much objective support and clarification to all of evolution. For example, when we say there is a nested heirarchy (evidence #1) we can see that it is not an arbitrary imposition of classification, but can be objectively based on DNA resemblances. It became possible to determine how closely related various organisms are. The work that is going on now about exactly how DNA triggers changes in organisms is very exciting and, like most scientific discoveries, surprising.\n \n Evidence # 7. The fossil record. Bear in mind again that when Darwin first figured this out, very, very few fossils had been found. ToE makes very specific predictions about what kinds of fossils will be found, and where. Now thousands and thousands of fossils have been found and identified. Let's just start with one feature of the fossils that have been found.\n \n According to ToE, at one time there were only replicating molecules, then single cell organisms, simple bacteria and algae, then eukarytic cells, simple multi-celled wormy thingies, simple aquatic life, amphibians, reptiles on land, mammals--in that order. Therefore we should expect to see that the older rocks should contain only fossils of the earlier forms of life, and newer rocks the more recent and complex forms. Further, and most important, we should never see more recent and complex forms in layers of rock that are under, and older than, more ancient and simple forms of life. And this is exactly what we have seen, over and over again, thousands of times. This has been so well established, over such a long period, by so many different scientists, that it is now accepted as a basis on which to build. Therefore we see modern scientists using this pattern as an assumption for new work.\n \n This evidence is so powerful, so consistent with geology and physics, and so extensive, that biologists by consensus accepted that ToE was confirmed with as much certainty as any current scientific theory.\n \n Please note that ToE does NOT predict that we will find a lot of fossils, or that we will find complete lines of fossils for every step in an evolutionary chain, or anything like that. That is because fossils are so rare, for geologic reasons. ToE makes two main predictions about fossils:\n 1. They will appear in the rock layers in chronological order, from simplest/oldest to most complex/newest. (Of course, new layers have simpler creatures as well, but older layers do not have the more complex creatures, because smaller and simpler forms of life continue while newer and more complex ones arise.)\n 2. Each and every one will fit somewhere on a vast tree with thousands of limbs, millions of branches, and tens of millions of twigs. It may be that the supporting branch is extinct, and we haven't yet found those fossils, so there are missing branches and twigs, but the overall sceme fits this tree-like pattern, which grows through geologic time.\n \n You can immediately see how these two predictions are so crucial to ToE over the grand scheme of time. Both of them have been confirmed over and over, in fact, every time, thousands of times. No bunnies have ever been found fossilized in pre-cambrian stone. No creatures have ever been found that could not be placed in time and relationships on this enormous tree of life.\n \n Evidence # 8. Transitional fossils. It's important to understand that ToE does not predict that we will find every transition for every line of descent. The main reason for this is that fossils are extremely rare, due the necessary conditions for their formation. But to the extent that we have been able to piece together such lines of descent, it confirms ToE.\n \n An excellent example: Paleontologists have been working for some time on the transition to life on land. Obviously this is a crucial, very exciting area. They finally figured out where they think this happened--in river deltas. Then they knew what kind of rocks were formed in river deltas, and where. So they went excavating in just those kind of rocks. And they found an example of what the theory predicts.It's called Tiktaalik. It's an amphibious fishy thing. Now these guys have all kinds of technical reasons why they classify it as they do, it has a doo-hickey bone in its ears, and its wrists look like such and such, etc. Too technical for me. But a couple of things about this. One is that finding such a creature was a very specific prediction that ToE made. They didn't just stumble on it or dig any old where. They predicted where they would find it, dug there, and did. And although we keep finding more fossils in this area, more water/land transitionals, and learning more and more about exactly how this happened, we now have a pretty good outline of where different extinct creatures fit in this story, which is cool. Finally, a very important prediction of ToE is confirmed: that life emerged from water to land, and that we can find fossils of extinct creatures on this cusp.\n \n Evidence # 9 Speciation has been observed in the lab. I'll say it again. Speciation has been observed in the lab. The question that ToE tries to answer is, what causes species? Initially, it was a hypothesis: random mutations plus natural selection plus time. But the problem is that it takes too much time to actually observe a new species developing. Now several scientists have had a chance to see new species emerge in fast-reproducing species, such as E. coli and fruit flies, just as evolution predicts. Examples can be found here.\n \n So, without any of the other evidence listed so far, which is more of a circumstantial type, we know that ToE explains the emergence of new species. The only question remaining is whether this process can be extrapolated on a larger scale.\n \n Because all this evidence is so huge, both in quantity and significance, biologists consider ToE to be basically completely confirmed, and no longer research its validity. They now use it as a foundation on which to explore further questions. It has comparable importance to germ theory, relativity, or electro-magnetic theory. That is why it, and only it, is taught in all introductory biology classes everywhere.",

   "Great post, and very informative. And I don't deny any of the basic conclusions you make accept where evo is applied or credited as relevant to the outcomes.\n\n \n Then you are forced to deny all of the conclusions, as well as all of science (see below) as they all make sense and support each other only in the light of evolutionary theory. \n \n \n Man has misinterpreted the finding to fit evo into the mix and therefor misunderstands the complete picture as it truly is. Evo is junk science...\n\n \n This literally makes no sense. Evolutionary theory makes specific predictions which have been validated, and which have a huge degree of consilience with other, equally accurately predictive sciences. There is no other way to 'interpret' the data. \n \n It is also very clear what specific hypothetical discoveries would falsify the theory. Not one has ever happened. What I am trying to get through to you is that regardless of your faith, evolution as a stand-alone structure is solid and cross-referentially supported from top to bottom, without a single exception in the data. It is as solidly supported as any of the sciences that have given us so much practical knowledge. \n \n Therefore, if you call evolution 'junk science' you must logically also adopt the position that ALL science is junk science, as evolution is so solid that it is almost a yardstick against which to measure the validity of other sciences. If the methods and tests which support evolution are all wrong, then so are the methods and tests that support every other science.\n \n Conversely if you accept that other sciences are valid you have no logical choice but to accept evolution as well. It really is all or nothing, precisely because of the degree of consilience involved and especially the predictive power of the theory. Think about it. We can literally use science to tell the future to a degree. If a theory's predictions are confirmed, that theory has literally told us that if we look at phenomena X, we will find, specifically, that it has qualities Y and Z which were previously uncertain, and lo and behold when we look it has just those qualities. When a theory can do this, as thermodynamics, relativity, cosmology, electromagnetism and evolution (among many others) can, I don't see how you can argue with it.\n \n \n and is just plain wrong as it applies to man evolving from a lower life form. Plain and simple.\n\n \n There are no 'lower' life forms. This is a very anthropocentric viewpoint, which we have absolutely no reason to hold given what cosmology can tell us about our place in the universe. There are older life forms, but that in no way places any life forms 'higher' or 'lower' on some kind of imaginary ladder of progress or strata of importance.\n \n For example, compare man with the arthropods (insects, crustaceans, arachnids and others). They look pretty much like inferior life, they're all pretty small, they seem to mostly act like little deterministic biological machines, and they die very easily. \n \n But, they outnumber us tens of thousands to one, and have been around in one form or another since before the cambrian, over 500 million years ago. They were the first animals to colonise the land. They reproduce in vast numbers. Some of them work together in huge colonies acting as one massive superorganism. A lot of them can fly. Some manufacture poisons and/or webs. Some 'farm' other insects. They live on land, in the sea, high in the air, underground, even inside other organisms; they are found everywhere on the planet, which they explored hundreds of times over before mammals even existed. They have been far more successful\n than us in terms of survival, colonisation and adaptation to the environment.\n \n So if I were to classify species as 'higher' or 'lower', the arthropods (along with sharks and crocodiles, who have been around for 200 million and about 70 million years respectively) as definitely 'higher' than us. Even if you use criteria such as intelligence, communication and production of material to claim that we are superior to the rest of life, there are plenty of examples that show that while these are our evolutionary fortes, we are not so stratospherically high above the rest as we like to think, and these are again very anthropcentric criteria. We look at what makes us different, and we find that of course, no other life quite measures up to us in those specific qualities. But if we look at other qualities, such as those of insects, we find that of course, they beat us hands down, because those are their evolutionary fortes. It's all a matter of perspective.\n \n For example, you can say \"Look at humans. We have systems of thought; ideologies, religions, politics and culture that no other life does.\"\n \n This is true. But you can also say \"Look at trees. They live longer than any other organisms, they get their food directly from the sun and the earth, they can survive massive damage, fires, and extreme weather like no other life can.\"\n \n \"Look at birds. They can fly, which only insects (which by virtue of their size and anatamoy find flying much easier) and one order of mammal can do, and they navigate across the world in their migrations using methods still unknown to us.\"\n \n \"Look at fish. They can breathe underwater, which no other vertebrates can do, and many of them have navigational powers similar to birds'.\"\n \n Every class of life, in fact every species, has its own particular unique trait which it is best at. Ours is our brain. That doesn't make us 'special'. The effect it has had is to allow us to be, purely biologically speaking, the top of the food chain. That's basically what we are, and that's the only thing that you could say is 'special' about us.\n \n Thanks to our technology, in theory there is no life that we cannot subjugate. But that's what it all comes down to; use of force. It is our ability to use force of such sophisticated nature that we have climbed to the top of the food chain. But there has always been someone at the top of the food chain, which is why it's not that special after all. There has to be someone at the top of the food chain. At the moment it's us.",

They call them false but cannot live their daily lives without them. Evolution is a lie, but using drugs derived from plant species traced through evolutionary biology is okay. Evolution is a lie, but filling a car with gas found through geology which shows a billions year old Earth with a evolutionary predicted fossil record and strata distribution is okay. Evolution is a lie, but astronomy is so cool as we learn about stars and space travel despite the fact that astronomy has evidence the universe is billions of years old.

If the methods and tests which support evolution are all wrong, then so are the methods and tests that support every other science.\n \n Conversely if you accept that other sciences are valid you have no logical choice but to accept evolution as well. It really is all or nothing, precisely because of the degree of consilience involved and especially the predictive power of the theory. Think about it. We can literally use science to tell the future to a degree. If a theory's predictions are confirmed, that theory has literally told us that if we look at phenomena X, we will find, specifically, that it has qualities Y and Z which were previously uncertain, and lo and behold when we look it has just those qualities. When a theory can do this, as thermodynamics, relativity, cosmology, electromagnetism and evolution (among many others) can, I don't see how you can argue with it.\n\n \n It's simple really. The concept of random mutations resulting in the World we live in today is balderdash. Plain and simple. You can reject the term, lower life forms if you like and worship at the alter of insect superiority and longevity but if you would like to come back to the real world for a minute I will remind you of the difference between acting on instinct which the animal kingdom survives on and critical thinking which man utilizes in creating and designing all aspects of our existence.\n \n Evolutionists have this skill of redefining what is accepted as normal in any other science. In biology it is boasted that one of mans great leaps forward was our ability to critically think. But you insist there are no lower life forms. Again the lack of consistency and the contradictions that exist within evo. One species of insect, any one you choose goes through literally hundreds of thousands of generations of life cycles in the span of one human lifetime. And as you say, they have been here for hundreds of millions of our years. So according to their life spans they have existed for multiple billions of generation of potential evolutionary changes. Yet they are still just insects acting upon inherited insticts passed down from their parents. \n \n My question to you is why doesn't an obviously smart guy like you ask this and other questions that obviously conflict with common sense if evo is real ? Given the time they've been here and given that we are evidence supposedly of higher intelligent evolution, how is it that after so long a period of time in evolutionary standards that insects have existed, that they are still basically just insects with no intellectual advancements at all ?\n \n Are you suggesting that some unspoken physical need within the Earth is limiting the evolutionary track of different species of life in order to maintain the so called balanced chain of life which prevents chaotic inbalances which could easilly destroy the planet if they took place ?\n \n Because again, that fits in with ID and rapid adaptation but not evolution.\n \n \nThere are no 'lower' life forms. emoticon_confused This is a very anthropocentric viewpoint, which we have absolutely no reason to hold given what cosmology can tell us about our place in the universe. There are older life forms, but that in no way places any life forms 'higher' or 'lower' on some kind of imaginary ladder of progress or strata of importance.\n \n For example, compare man with the arthropods (insects, crustaceans, arachnids and others). They look pretty much like inferior life, they're all pretty small, they seem to mostly act like little deterministic biological machines, and they die very easily. \n \n But, they outnumber us tens of thousands to one, and have been around in one form or another since before the cambrian, over 500 million years ago. They were the first animals to colonise the land. They reproduce in vast numbers. Some of them work together in huge colonies acting as one massive superorganism. A lot of them can fly. Some manufacture poisons and/or webs. Some 'farm' other insects. They live on land, in the sea, high in the air, underground, even inside other organisms; they are found everywhere on the planet, which they explored hundreds of times over before mammals even existed. They have been far more successful\n than us in terms of survival, colonisation and adaptation to the environment.\n \n So if I were to classify species as 'higher' or 'lower', the arthropods (along with sharks and crocodiles, who have been around for 200 million and about 70 million years respectively) as definitely 'higher' than us. Even if you use criteria such as intelligence, communication and production of material to claim that we are superior to the rest of life, there are plenty of examples that show that while these are our evolutionary fortes, we are not so stratospherically high above the rest as we like to think, and these are again very anthropcentric criteria. We look at what makes us different, and we find that of course, no other life quite measures up to us in those specific qualities. But if we look at other qualities, such as those of insects, we find that of course, they beat us hands down, because those are their evolutionary fortes. It's all a matter of perspective.\n \n For example, you can say \"Look at humans. We have systems of thought; ideologies, religions, politics and culture that no other life does.\"\n \n This is true. But you can also say \"Look at trees. They live longer than any other organisms, they get their food directly from the sun and the earth, they can survive massive damage, fires, and extreme weather like no other life can.\"\n \n \"Look at birds. They can fly, which only insects (which by virtue of their size and anatamoy find flying much easier) and one order of mammal can do, and they navigate across the world in their migrations using methods still unknown to us.\"\n \n \"Look at fish. They can breathe underwater, which no other vertebrates can do, and many of them have navigational powers similar to birds'.\"\n \n Every class of life, in fact every species, has its own particular unique trait which it is best at. Ours is our brain. That doesn't make us 'special'. The effect it has had is to allow us to be, purely biologically speaking, the top of the food chain. That's basically what we are, and that's the only thing that you could say is 'special' about us.\n\n \n Excellant, let's look at birds, for centuries man has watched them and finally at the beginning of the 20th century we learned to fly also. And we have created compasses and GPS that allows us to pinpoint our exact location in the World at any given moment. And we have overcome the challenges of not only breathing underwater but have created vehicles that will support hundreds of people under water for a year without ever surfacing if need be. Show me a whale that can do that without ever surfacing for air.\n \n You see we have the ability to take any beneficial skill any member of the animal or insect kingdom has naturally and adopt it for ourselves. We THINK, we don't survive by inherited traits and instincts born into us from our parents. We take our parents skills and expand on them. That is the definition of being human.\n \n \nThanks to our technology, in theory there is no life that we cannot subjugate. But that's what it all comes down to; use of force. It is our ability to use force of such sophisticated nature that we have climbed to the top of the food chain. But there has always been someone at the top of the food chain, which is why it's not that special after all. There has to be someone at the top of the food chain. At the moment it's us.\n\n \n Now, for one last flaw in your perfect science. You insist above that we didn't come from some lower form as if we were secretly destined a hundred million years ago to become what we are as homo sapiens. But according to evo man has genetically changed from a lower life form to what we are today. And the alleged evidence of that from your perspective is that again, allegedly 100 million years ago man didn't exist at all. A billion years ago most forms of life on earth didn't exist at all. 5 billion years ago according to evo all that existed on earth was an atmosphere of sulfuric acid and ammonia, yet from that dead planet, life spontaniously began by the act of random mutations that accidentally happened. According to statisticians, the chances of the diversity and complexity of life from the simplest organism to the human being existing in such perfect harmony we call the chain of life is about 100 Trillion to one to the 10th degree.\n \n Now consider that abiogenesis, another science that you say melds with evo like a pair of gloves insists that what I said above is how we started as life on planet earth. So how do you insist that all sciences compliment each other perfectly ? I know, I just don't get it right ? Yet you will never successfully explain the contradictions, nor will you have either the courage or the commitment to the truth to insist that evo answer these contradictions and inconsistencies.",

   "**\n Pardon me for butting in, and please do not mistake me for a creationist like archangel, but you are only rehashing the darwinist dogma here.\n\n \n Bology is science, not dogma. Evolution as a fact is support by empirical observation, in the field, lab and fossil record. Darwinism as one of the several mechanisms of evolution is also supported by empirical data. Where there is empirical data to suggest that Darwinian selection does not operate in evolution, then biologists accept that it doesn't. Genetic drift, for example.\n \n \nThe truth is, there is no documented empirical evidence of any kind tio the effect that random genetic mutations are anything but systemically entropic and destructive.\n\n \n On the contrary, there is plenty of evidence that mutations often lead to new biological information and adaptation.\n \n \nOTH, genetic mutations that are systemically adaptive and productive can always be traced to an immediate and proximate environmental stimulus which provokes a behavioural and organic response in the affected biosystem. There is nothing random about organisms making systematic adaptations to random environmental changes.\n\n \n Nope. There is no evidence that environmental changes can provoke specific and directed mutations, though they can increase general mutations rates. You are confusing randomness of variation, i.e. mutation of genetic sequence, with the directionality of natural selection. As for individual organisms adapting to changes in local conditions, that is a separate issue from natural selection. They may have genomes that permit sufficient phenotypic plasticity for one genome to adapt to several environments. There are many trivial examples of this in botany, and more in zoology. However, those are temporary. What Darwinian evolution is about is permanent and hereditary changes owing to differential selection among variants.\n \n \nOnly true of _random_ mutations, but to be expected of random changes, since randomness is by definition, directionless and ateleleological.\n\n \n Again, mutations are random, so far as anyone can tell. Natural selection is highly non-random, which is why evolution happens, because it selects variants able to operate in an environment over ones that are less able. Natural selection operates on the menu of organisms thrown up by random mutation, and selects those that fit the environment. If the variant can't fit the environment, it has a reduced opportunity to pass on its genes. Hence the directionality of natural selection.\n \n \nBUT, as above, at the proximate and immediate level, (as opposed to anything distant and as yet unexperienced), there is _always_ a teleological direction to adaptive biuosystem mutation, that is, from novel and random environmental stimulus to immediate and specific biosystemic response to that stimulus, a direct cause/effect re-ordering that may or may not result in an adaptive organismic mutation which may, at some point, stimulate a genetic mutation.\n\n \n Total speculation. No such teleological direction of mutation has ever been demonstrated, besides some dubious and highly controversial experiments in bacteria, for which perfectly Darwinian explanations were offered. Of course, if you have solid evidence for it, feel free to produce it.\n \n \nEither way, they are always entropic and maladaptive, as millions of experiments have shown. Only systematically teleological mutations are ever adaptive and productive.\n\n \n Nope. Most mutations are neutral. Perhaps you do not quite understand what biologists mean by a mutation. It is not some macroscopic malformation; it is just a change in the genetic code. Many mutations involve gene duplications, for example, which allows for the evolution of new genes with new functionalities. There is considerable empirical evidence for this.\n \n \nUnfortunately, that supposition follows naturally from an acceptance of the darwinian 'principle' of \"natural selection\". Which, itself, is pure humbuggery; a meaningless, pointless 'truism' that has been elevated from a false literary conceit to a false pseudoscientific notion, in the service of an atheistic, and now discredited, metaphysic.\n\n \n Nope. Natural selection is an empirically demonstrated reality. It is not postulated to account for everything in evolution, however, but it is still considered the major mechanism to account for adaptation.\n \n \nName a homeostatic system, a self-sustaining, self-directed autopoietic system, that does not possess an internally generated and controlled , \"intentionality involved in maintaining the status quo\".\n\n \n Homeostatic systems do not necessarily exhibit intentionality. Take a Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. It maintains itself over a considerable period of time, but is hardly intentional! It's just chemistry that is far from equilibrium, but that stays in a steady, oscillating state, much like many biochemical reactions. No intentionality needed.\n \n \nNot true of the ideology that is darwinism, either. And ID was intentionally tutned into a travesty of its real self by the false equivocations of creationists and darwinists.\n\n \n Sorry, but Darwinism is not ideology, it's science. It's empirically demonstrated. IDism is religion in sheep's clothing.\n \n \nGenuine ID asserts that evolution is correct, but darwinism is wrong. But genuine ID has been assasinated by darwinists and creationsts in order to protect theier respective ideologies.\n\n \n There is no science in IDeology.

Evolution is not darwinism, however, despite darwinian insistence upon the false equivocation. Darwinism has never been supported by \"empirical observation, in the field, lab and fossil record\". You have to throw off your dogmatic assumption that evolution and darwinism are synonymous.\n \n \n\n Darwinism as one of the several mechanisms of evolution is also supported by empirical data.\n\n \n **\n Darwinism is a metaphysical postulate derived out of materialism/mechanism/logical positivism, then euphemized as physicalism and naturalism, which postulates one single \"mechanism\", or rather, non-mechanism, as an explanatory hypothesis re the causes of evolution in lifeforms. That 'non-mechanism', that 'metaphysical notion', is that evolution is a succession of happy accidents wherebye changes in lifeforms and their subsequent behaviours and abilities are spontaneously generated by random, haphazard chemical changes at the molecular level. There is no empirical data to support this would-be 'mechanism', and plenty of empirical evidence to the contrary.\n \n \n \n\n Where there is empirical data to suggest that Darwinian selection does not operate in evolution, then biologists accept that it doesn't. Genetic drift, for example.\n\n \n **\n Which does not alter or effect the primary postulate of darwinism, i.e., that all evolution is accidental and ateleological--a metaphysical dogma if ever there was one.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n The truth is, there is no documented empirical evidence of any kind tio the effect that random genetic mutations are anything but systemically entropic and destructive. \n \n \n On the contrary, there is plenty of evidence that mutations often lead to new biological information and adaptation.\n\n \n **\n You have to learn to read what's written. I said that adaptive mutations, organismic or genetic, can and often do \"lead to new biological information and adaptation\". I also said that RANDOM GENETIC MUTATIONS are never adaptive, but always systemically entropic, and so never \"lead to new biological information and adaptation\", as darwinists persistently claim-- without any evidence to support this metaphysical postulate. Entropic system failure, by definition, can never increase systemic productivity. System failure, (i.e., random accidents), always decreases productivity in complex systems, including complex information systems such as the genome.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n OTH, genetic mutations that are systemically adaptive and productive can always be traced to an immediate and proximate environmental stimulus which provokes a behavioural and organic response in the affected biosystem. There is nothing random about organisms making systematic adaptations to random environmental changes. \n \n \n Nope. \n\n \n **\n Yup.\n \n \n\n There is no evidence that environmental changes can provoke specific and directed mutations, though they can increase general mutations rates.\n\n \n **\n You need to catch up with the literature. The direct correlation between environmental stimulus and specific organismic response is ubiquitous, and undeniable, except by dogmatic ideologues.\n \n \n\n You are confusing randomness of variation, i.e. mutation of genetic sequence, with the directionality of natural selection.\n\n \n **\n I'm not confusing anything. But if you think that your \"natural selection\" is 'directional', then you need to re-read your own dogma, which in fact denies \"directionality\" altogether, both short and long term. According to darwinist evolution, whatever \"happens\", just \"happens\" to \"happen\", that's all. And the notion that a randomly-acting environment somehow supplies the missing regularity to this would-be 'mechanism', is just plain ridiculous.\n \n \n \n\n As for individual organisms adapting to changes in local conditions, that is a separate issue from natural selection.\n\n \n **\n As far as I'm concerned, \"Natural Selection\" is a preposterously inflated truism masquerading as a meaningful principle, but since darwinists like yourself believe that all of biology depends on evolution, and evolutionary 'science' depends upon \"NS\", I'd like to know just how you manage to make this exception to your basic principle.\n \n \n \n\n They may have genomes that permit sufficient phenotypic plasticity for one genome to adapt to several environments.\n\n \n **\n And just how does \"phenotypic plasticity\" lift them above the hurly-burly of your \"natural selection\"?!?\n \n \n\n There are many trivial examples of this in botany, and more in zoology.\n\n \n **\n Examples of what? Phenotypic plasticity? Of course there are. Is phenotypic plasticity darwinian? Of course it's not. So is phenotypic plasticity explained by \"NS\", by \"RMNS\", by darwinism, by chance? Of course it is not. Phenotypic plasticity is anti-darwinian, but pro intelligent, self-directed, self-controlled biosystems.\n \n \n\n However, those are temporary. What Darwinian evolution is about is permanent and hereditary changes owing to differential selection among variants.\n\n \n **\n \"Differential selection among variants\" says nothing at at all about the origins and causes of those variants, and the causes for the origins of variants in biosystems, i.e., organisms, is what evolution is all about. Your \"differential selection among variants\" is just a fancy way of saying that statistics fluctuate. It explains nothing but temporary local numerical population fluctuations, and as such is simply ecological arithmetic, and is nothing to do with _evolution_, i.e., ORIGINS, per se.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Only true of _random_ mutations, but to be expected of random changes, since randomness is by definition, directionless and ateleleological. \n \n \n Again, mutations are random, so far as anyone can tell.\n\n \n **\n You mean so far as darwinists will insist. And it is true that maladaptive, destructive mutations, like all accidental events, do happen haphazardly in highly complex, productive biosystems. But to leap from the fact of entropy to a supposition that entropy supplies the mechanism generating greater complexity and improved productivity, i.e., adaptive mutation, is perfectly absurd.\n \n \n \n\n Natural selection is highly non-random,\n\n \n **\n That's preposterous. Your \"NS\" is completely and utterly an effect of environmental causation, and environmental causes are at best chaotic, at worst entirely, stochastically, random. To claim, as you darwinists do, that random environmental causation produces a regular, non-random effect, and that that supposedly, but impossibly, \"regular\" effect, (NS), is itself a \"mechanism\", i.e., a \"cause\", for the origins of novel variants in organisms, is such a glaring example of \"newspeak\" that it should drive all rational thinkers up the wall.\n \n \n \n\n which is why evolution happens, because it selects variants able to operate in an environment over ones that are less able.\n\n \n **\n Who or what is this 'universal chooser' that you call \"NS\", and what is its/her universal criterion for discrimination, and how does she/it cause new variants to arise, just by 'choosing' among old and established ones?? I'm afraid that all I hear is you repeating the dogmatic drivel you memorized in order to pass your exams.\n \n \n \n\n Natural selection operates on the menu of organisms thrown up by random mutation, and selects those that fit the environment.\n\n \n **\n Shorten that up some way and it'll make a great bumper-sticker. Otherwise its just one more example of vacuous pomposity.\n \n \n \n\n If the variant can't fit the environment, it has a reduced opportunity to pass on its genes. Hence the directionality of natural selection.\n\n \n **\n What \"directionality\"? 'Whatever happens, happens', is not \"directionality\". _Direction_ is an aspect of causation, not a derivative of effect. Water flowage has direction because gravity causes it to flow downhill, not because it 'just does' flow downhill. Your 'natural selection' is a statistical effect, not a scientific cause. Its the way the water flows, not the reason why it flows that way, if I may extend the analogy.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n BUT, as above, at the proximate and immediate level, (as opposed to anything distant and as yet unexperienced), there is _always_ a teleological direction to adaptive biosystem mutation, that is, from novel and random environmental stimulus to immediate and specific biosystemic response to that stimulus, a direct cause/effect re-ordering that may or may not result in an adaptive organismic mutation which may, at some point, stimulate a genetic mutation. \n \n \n Total speculation. No such teleological direction of mutation has ever been demonstrated,\n \n \n **\n Nonsense. It's empirically obvious to anyone not wearing ideological blinders.\n Bacteria, pests, weeds, etc. don't grow steadily more susceptible to our toxins--they become steadily more resistant, and more specifically resistant, to them.\n \n \n\n besides some dubious and highly controversial experiments in bacteria, for which perfectly Darwinian explanations were offered. \n\n \n **\n The wonder of darwinism is, that since it is pure metaphysics, it can, like any religion, explain anything at any time. That is why it is junk science.\n \n \n\n Of course, if you have solid evidence for it, feel free to produce it.\n\n \n **\n As above--any biological resistance to any man-made toxin will do the trick.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Either way, they are always entropic and maladaptive, as millions of experiments have shown. Only systematically teleological mutations are ever adaptive and productive. \n \n \n Nope.\n\n \n **\n Yup.\n \n \n\n Most mutations are neutral.\n\n \n **\n Meaning ineffectual trivialities. So?\n \n \n\n Perhaps you do not quite understand what biologists mean by a mutation.\n\n \n **\n I'm familiar with darwinian newspeak, and know what darwinists mean when they use that poor, semantically mangled, word.\n \n \n\n It is not some macroscopic malformation; it is just a change in the genetic code.\n\n \n **\n That's the darwinist re-definition, alright.\n \n \n\n Many mutations involve gene duplications, for example, which allows for the evolution of new genes with new functionalities. There is considerable empirical evidence for this.\n\n \n **\n Yes, there are. And gene duplication is strong empirical evidence for systematic, self-directed, heuristic, non-random, non-accidental genetic restructuring and re-designing within a self-operated, self-serving, complex, productive, biosystem. Of course, you dogmatically leap to the darwinist assumption that gene duplication is just accidental and pointless.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Unfortunately, that supposition follows naturally from an acceptance of the darwinian 'principle' of \"natural selection\". Which, itself, is pure humbuggery; a meaningless, pointless 'truism' that has been elevated from a false literary conceit to a false pseudoscientific notion, in the service of an atheistic, and now discredited, metaphysic. \n \n \n Nope.\n\n \n **\n Yup.\n \n \n\n Natural selection is an empirically demonstrated reality.\n\n \n **\n \"Natural Selection\", as a statistical _effect_, is nothing but a fact parading as a principle. \"Natural Selection\" as a _cause_ is nothing but the vacuous truism that big dogs usually beat up little dogs, or put another way, the struggle may not always be won by the strong, nor the race by the swift, but that's the way to bet. And you call that, 'science'?!?! Besides which, under normal circumstances, (i.e., not abnormal, generally catastrophic environmental circumstances) no 'selective' effect upon general populations has ever been empirically demonstrated. Your \"selection\" is inoperative, and your \"fitness\" is simply a matter of blind chance.\n \n \n \n\n It is not postulated to account for everything in evolution, however, but it is still considered the major mechanism to account for adaptation.\n\n \n **\n It certainly is so held, dogmatically, by darwinists. For no scientific reason, but for a strictly ideological compulsion.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Name a homeostatic system, a self-sustaining, self-directed autopoietic system, that does not possess an internally generated and controlled , \"intentionality involved in maintaining the status quo\". \n \n \n Homeostatic systems do not necessarily exhibit intentionality. Take a Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. It maintains itself over a considerable period of time, but is hardly intentional!\n\n \n **.\n I have no idea what you are getting at here. How does an extended chemical interaction relate to a complex system's self-maintained productivity? I just don't see grounds for comparison. \n \n [quote]\n It's just chemistry that is far from equilibrium, but that stays in a steady, oscillating state, much like many biochemical reactions. No intentionality needed.{/quote]\n \n **\n No productivity exhibited either, I'll hazard a guess. Hence no relation to any biosystem under discussion here. Sounds like a red-herring, to me.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Not true of the ideology that is darwinism, either. And ID was intentionally turned into a travesty of its real self by the false equivocations of creationists and darwinists. \n \n \n Sorry, but Darwinism is not ideology, it's science.\n\n \n **\n Sorry, darwinism is ideological pseudo-science. Junk, that is.\n \n \n\n It's empirically demonstrated.\n\n \n **\n No, it absolutely is not.\n \n \n\n IDism is religion in sheep's clothing.\n\n \n \n **\n That is what you darwinists, and your accomplices, the creationists, have turned it into. Why? In order to turn evolutionary science into a political debate founded upon a false dichotomy.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Genuine ID asserts that evolution is correct, but darwinism is wrong.

Your two ideologies have thus, by distorting the meaning of \"intelligent design\", muddied the waters irreparably, and done great harm to the scientific quest for truth. I can no longer use the term, knowing that it has been corrupted permanently. But that does not mean that without the \"ID\" label, the evidence found by modern biologists indicating a teleological mechanism for organismic evolution can now be ignored by you quarreling ideologues.",

In biology it is boasted that one of mans great leaps forward was our ability to critically think. But you insist there are no lower life forms.

It explains how through selective pressures that man arose to the top of the food chain. \n \n \nOne species of insect, any one you choose goes through literally hundreds of thousands of generations of life cycles in the span of one human lifetime.

Yet they are still just insects acting upon inherited insticts passed down from their parents.\n\n \n Because they are well adapted to a specific ecological niche. They do not have environmental pressures forcing them to change. This is the basis of evolution. Not understanding that would conclude that you are indeed talking about something entirely different.

Evolution argues that environmental pressures coupled with new genes from mutations leads to microevolution and eventually macroevolution.

It's not a puzzle. In any case, individual species do not usually last so long. They do vary, and can be very similar to preceding species.\n \n\n \n Hi lesz, this answer is total speculation, assumption and a theory at best that is based on no factual information at all. Unless of course you have either lived as an insect, lived with insects, or interviewed an insect lately. I marvel that in the course of these debates you all pronounce these beliefs as if they are common knowledge in the real World. \n \n Given the huge assumptions you make that weak little insects have experienced no pressures that would motivate evolution to a higher functioning state of being. Don't you just also assume mans need to evolve is based on the different levels of primates found that you attribute to our lineage ? You realize don't you that Java, Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal are also the result of huge assumptions that they are actual descendants of human beings dont you ? Someone posted that the DNA tests run on mr neanderthal were somewhat similar to ours as if he was proving something. Well the chimp has 98% of our DNA and although he's a primate, he's not even close to being human. \n \n The fact is that evo doesn't verify or prove any environmental pressures existed that forced man to evolve to the higher state of being we have attained. They assume alot but they don't prove it at all because it is unprovable. You see DNA tests and fossils wont tell us if our alleged descendants had the spirits of humanity in them that separates us from the animals kingdom. But let me change the subject for one more issue of inconsistency and contradiction in evo. And this is directed to anyone.\n \n Here's another question for you to ponder as you deny Intelligent Design is possible. Trees have been used as evidence of evolution for a long time now so let me ask you this. Each different type of tree has a different way of creating seeds so that they have a bigger chance of surviving to maturity. The major ways of transportation are water, air or animals. Some seeds traveling by air remain flying for hours (cottonwood trees) while others have only ten seconds to land in the perfect spot to grow (maple trees), while others resemble whirly birds and fly for hundreds of yards on the currents before touching down. A seed can rely on an animal in many different ways. The tree could produce delicious fruit so that a mouse or other animal would eat it and release the seeds in its droppings (apple trees). Another example would be a watermelon seed carried away by a field mouse or chipmunk. Or a squirrel which is the progenitor of so many eggcorns over the Ages.\n \n Now trees don't think or make choices at all. They are presumably bonded to the Earth where they fall, or should I say end up as seeds. My question is this, how can you deny the hand of an intelligent designer who designed the original ability for so many diverse trees, with so many diverse types of seeds to scatter them in so many unique yet successful ways ?

   "and as I thought, you didn't think things through again, because you have a predetermined conclusion, so why bother thinking about things, right? Trees have been aroud for about 350 Million years (I'm going off the top of my head here, so I'm sure someone can correct me. The important point is the time scale). Early trees reproduced by spores - just like ferns do. Eventually, through many small steps, spores mutated into seeds. Seeds have several advantages over spores (protection, built in nutrient source, etc), so those trees which had the advantage of seed-like reproduction techniques had more offspring, which means the advantages became more common and were the majority.\n \n Again, all your \"questions\" are explained in the exact same way as above. Small, incremental changes, each of which conferred a small advantage. For one example, let's take an apple. Apple trees produce a fruit to transport and feed it's seeds. What kind of apple would you (or any animal) rather eat: a good tasting one or a bad tasting one? So, those fruits which were better tasting were eaten, and the seeds carried away from the tree to be deposited in the animal droppings-away from the competition of the other apple trees. Those which didn't taste very good were dropped near the tree they came from (too bitter, etc so they weren't eaten), and the saplings had less chance to survive as they were competing against the other apple tree(s).\n \n See, it's actually pretty simple and common sense if, like I said, you think about it for 2 seconds and don't have a predetermined conclusion to jump towards",

But, as I have already argued, while this is a perfectly valid position to hold it does not make us 'special'. Mammals in general have large brain/body ratios, and primates larger still. All it took was another step in that direction. Humans are unique in the size of our frontal lobes where evidence suggests our conscious decision-making processes take place. But every species is unique in some way and there have been many 'great leaps forward'. Even the fact that we seem to be 'more different' from other species than they are from each other does not mean a whole lot. Consider the first species to photosynthesize, the first to utilise oxygen for energy, the first gills, the first teeth, the first lungs, the first wings etc. \n \n 2) There is no fine line between 'pure instinct' and 'conscious thought'. Countless experiments have shown that some species of bird, lizard, mammal and notably octopuses display very sophisticated abilities in terms of applied learning, tool use and communication. The argument from an evolutionary standpoint is that once these abilities reach a certain level, they become self-reinforcing over the course of generations. Roger Penrose, the acclaimed physicist and polymath coined (I believe) the term 'extelligence' to complement 'intelligence'. Intelligence is the individual's ability to learn from experience and others, to apply that learned knowledge, and to communicate with others. Extelligence results from mass intercommunication, the sharing of knowledge, which eventually becomes what we call 'culture', including moral values, religious and political ideologies, artistic sensibilities, and scientific knowledge. Intelligence and extelligence reinforce each other over time in a positive feedback loop. We can see minor examples of extelligence in the 'lower' life forms all the time, in that most animals teach their young what their parents taught them, and there are groups of primates that have been observed in the wild to learn to use new tools and new, successful group behaviours over the course of generations as the result of one of their members originally trying something new. The one thing we have that they do not is the ability to store knowledge outside of ourselves, originally through writing. This is not such a huge conceptual leap but accelerates the expansion of extelligence exponentially.\n \n You also ask why no other species has developed such in/extelligence. While there is, as yet, no precise answer, we can look at the huge body of data that we have on the history of life on earth and come to three very obvious and well-founded conclusions:\n \n 1) Environmental pressures. This is the most obvious, simplest, and I will concede weakest of the three. Each species exists in its own bubble of environmental pressures (which are geographical, climatic and ecological) which 'guide' its evolutionary development upon a particular 'path'. But none of those 'paths' have to lead to the rise of in/extelligence; if this happens it is just a by-product of specific pressures, and would not need to be (in fact almost certainly would not be) the same pressures if multiple instances were to occur.\n \n 2) Biological limitations. As I said, primates have the largest brain/body ratio of any animal (two exceptions; dolphins and octopuses). As such, as far as we know, they are the only group with anything approaching our own cognitive abilities. Such a large brain also requires a constant, large supply of energy; there is no way any cold blooded creatures could possibly sustain the kind of brain needed for conscious thought. That rules out most of life right there. And obviously insects (and all creatures below a size not much smaller than our own) do not have the size needed for a brain of such complexity.\n \n 3) In/extelligence is a very recent evolutionary phenomenon. Someone always has to be first. Considering the evidence that very early cultural man left for us to find, it is highly unlikely that any other species could have evolved a similar degree of brain functions before we did and left no traces of culture. I'm going to go out on a limb here and list , off the top of my head, some arbitrary 'great leaps forward' in evolution (leaving out all the complex biochemical leaps that occurred before multicultural [edit: I meant multicellular but I though I'd leave it cos it's such a funny typo] life, which includes things like photosynthesis)\n \n *~1200 million years ago: Multicellular life; sexual reproduction \n * 600 mya: Tissue differentiation; bilateral symmetry\n * 570 mya: Exoskeleton\n * 540 mya: Circulation; Gills\n * 500 mya: Endoskeleton\n * 475 mya: Plants colonise land\n * 450 mya: Arthropods colonise land\n * 365 mya: Swim bladders; lungs; animals colonise land\n * 360 mya: Seeds\n * 300 mya: Insects evolve flight\n * 220 mya: Therapsids (first warm-blooded animals)\n * 200 mya: Dinosaurs\n * 110 mya: Birds\n * 65 mya: BANG! emoticon_cry \n * ~2 mya: In/extelligence\n \n \n Excellent, let's look at birds, for centuries man has watched them and finally at the beginning of the 20th century we learned to fly also. And we have created compasses and GPS that allows us to pinpoint our exact location in the World at any given moment. And we have overcome the challenges of not only breathing underwater but have created vehicles that will support hundreds of people under water for a year without ever surfacing if need be. Show me a whale that can do that without ever surfacing for air.\n \n You see we have the ability to take any beneficial skill any member of the animal or insect kingdom has naturally and adopt it for ourselves. We THINK, we don't survive by inherited traits and instincts born into us from our parents. We take our parents skills and expand on them. That is the definition of being human.\n\n \n OK, so we can emulate the advantages that other species have. This is purely because our evolutionary advantage is our problem-solving ability. Once you can, as a species, look consciously at your environment, that gives you a massive, self-reinforcing advantage. That doesn't make you 'higher' by definition. It just means you have an advantage. And, we have only built up this advantage over hundreds of thousands of years of having such an efficient brain. For most of our history we have had very limited technology and only an average (for our species) population. Over the last half-millenium since the Enlightenment and 'scientific revolution' allowed us to innovate outside the box of religious dogma (that's not an insult it's a fact) both have increased faster and faster. If we lost all that knowledge due to some major event you can hardly argue that both our population and ability to manipulate our environment would drop dramatically, and quickly.\n \n \nNow, for one last flaw in your perfect science. You insist above that we didn't come from some lower form as if we were secretly destined a hundred million years ago to become what we are as homo sapiens. But according to evo man has genetically changed from a lower life form to what we are today.\n\n \n No, we have evolved from other, older life forms. \n \n \nAnd the alleged evidence of that from your perspective is that again, allegedly 100 million years ago man didn't exist at all. A billion years ago most forms of life on earth didn't exist at all. 5 billion years ago according to evo all that existed on earth was an atmosphere of sulfuric acid and ammonia, yet from that dead planet, life spontaneously began by the act of random mutations that accidentally happened.\n\n \n Not accidentally, or spontaneously. The use of the word 'accidentally' is a fundamental misunderstanding. Chemistry does not happen accidentally, it happens according to very specific rules, and given the right ingredients, life is pretty much inevitable. See below.\n \n The use of the word 'spontaneously' is meaningless; nothing happens spontaneously in any scientific discipline. Spontaneity is a quality of 'free will' and as such may not even exist (you'll have to ask the philosophers and neuroscientists!).\n \n \nAccording to statisticians, the chances of the diversity and complexity of life from the simplest organism to the human being existing in such perfect harmony we call the chain of life is about 100 Trillion to one to the 10th degree.\n\n \n This statistical argument is actually very flawed, in that in does not take all the factors into account. Given that our planet orbits the right kind of star, at the right distance, with a bunch of gas giants further out to soak up impacts, and given that organic compounds form very easily when the correct chemical environment exists, it is just as valid to claim that it was very likely that life would start on earth. \n \n \nNow consider that abiogenesis, another science that you say melds with evo like a pair of gloves insists that what I said above is how we started as life on planet earth. So how do you insist that all sciences compliment each other perfectly?\n\n \n I'm sorry, but I just don't see how your question follows from the previous sentence. Plus, I don't insist that all sciences complement each other perfectly. For example, the problem with physics at the moment is that relativity and quantum mechanics give us major problems when we try to combine them, and I'm sure there are plenty of less glaring examples; the only way all sciences could complement each other perfectly would be if we had a complete 'theory of everything'. My point was that there are theories within science that have a high degree of consilience, in that huge amounts of well-established data from other theories supports them as well as data from the theory itself. Evolution is such a consilient theory.\n \n \nHere's another question for you to ponder as you deny Intelligent Design is possible. Trees have been used as evidence of evolution for a long time now so let me ask you this. Each different type of tree has a different way of creating seeds so that they have a bigger chance of surviving to maturity. The major ways of transportation are water, air or animals. Some seeds traveling by air remain flying for hours (cottonwood trees) while others have only ten seconds to land in the perfect spot to grow (maple trees), while others resemble whirly birds and fly for hundreds of yards on the currents before touching down. A seed can rely on an animal in many different ways. The tree could produce delicious fruit so that a mouse or other animal would eat it and release the seeds in its droppings (apple trees). Another example would be a watermelon seed carried away by a field mouse or chipmunk. Or a squirrel which is the progenitor of so many eggcorns over the Ages.\n \n Now trees don't think or make choices at all. They are presumably bonded to the Earth where they fall, or should I say end up as seeds. My question is this, how can you deny the hand of an intelligent designer who designed the original ability for so many diverse trees, with so many diverse types of seeds to scatter them in so many unique yet successful ways ?\n\n \n Precisely because the evolution of a seed doesn't need anyone to know whether or not that seed will be successful. All a seed needs to do is have one of a vast number of characteristics that make it slightly likelier to end up in a spot where it can grow. The seeds that have inferior versions of those characteristics will also be successful, but will be less represented in the next generation. The seeds that don't have any useful characteristic will not be represented at all. After millions of generations only the seeds that were really, really good at what they did will have any surviving descendents, many of whom will have changed beyond all recognition. This is the essence of the theory of natural selection. It is an entirely passive process, but very efficiently filters results.",

   "and as I thought, you didn't think things through again, because you have a predetermined conclusion, so why bother thinking about things, right? Trees have been aroud for about 350 Million years (I'm going off the top of my head here, so I'm sure someone can correct me. The important point is the time scale). Early trees reproduced by spores - just like ferns do. Eventually, through many small steps, spores mutated into seeds. Seeds have several advantages over spores (protection, built in nutrient source, etc), so those trees which had the advantage of seed-like reproduction techniques had more offspring, which means the advantages became more common and were the majority.\n \n Again, all your \"questions\" are explained in the exact same way as above. Small, incremental changes, each of which conferred a small advantage. For one example, let's take an apple. Apple trees produce a fruit to transport and feed it's seeds. What kind of apple would you (or any animal) rather eat: a good tasting one or a bad tasting one? So, those fruits which were better tasting were eaten, and the seeds carried away from the tree to be deposited in the animal droppings-away from the competition of the other apple trees. Those which didn't taste very good were dropped near the tree they came from (too bitter, etc so they weren't eaten), and the saplings had less chance to survive as they were competing against the other apple tree(s).\n \n See, it's actually pretty simple and common sense if, like I said, you think about it for 2 seconds and don't have a predetermined conclusion to jump towards\n\n \n I truly marvel at your ability to rationalize anything in such a way as to give the glory to your imaginary belief system.

   "Hi lesz, this answer is total speculation, assumption and a theory at best that is based on no factual information at all. Unless of course you have either lived as an insect, lived with insects, or interviewed an insect lately. I marvel that in the course of these debates you all pronounce these beliefs as if they are common knowledge in the real World. \n\n \n It may come as a surprise, Arc, but scientists study insects extensively. They are very well adapted! Your original argument, if you'll forgive me for stretching the meaning of the word, is basically of this form: If men evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?, which is usually uttered in a triumphalist tone under the vague and false impression it's a clinching one!\n \n Sorry, but it is simply a fact that when a daughter species evolves from a parent species to adopt a slightly different niche or geographic location, that does not mean the parent species is obliged to either go extinct, or all evolve in lockstep. The original niche need not disappear, and any third species trying to adopt the new niche the daughter species has already claimed is going to face fierce competition. So parent and daughter species can co-exist in time, and sometimes in geographical location. There is nothing remarkable here, just plain, common sense.\n \n \nDon't you just also assume mans need to evolve...\n\n \n I don't assume humanity has any \"need to evolve\". The evidence shows we just did. We can hardly avoid evolution.\n \n \nYou realize don't you that Java, Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal are also the result of huge assumptions that they are actual descendants of human beings dont you ?\n\n \n Well, possible ancestors, actually. If you can think of a better explanation to explain the sequential appearance of fossils that become more and more like modern humans through time, I'd like to hear it.\n \n A question... was your god practicing?\n \n \nWell the chimp has 98% of our DNA and although he's a primate, he's not even close to being human. \n\n \n Ha! A lot closer than Creos like to think! Humans and chimps share many physiological and mental traits in common. I suspect it would upset you to realise how many!\n \n \nThe fact is that evo doesn't verify or prove any environmental pressures existed that forced man to evolve to the higher state of being we have attained.\n\n \n Sorry, but paleontology demonstrates that modern humans didn't appear on the scene till something like 100-200,000 years ago, while bipedal human ancestors first appeared some 4-6 million years ago. It's true that scientists are still investigating why bipedality evolved, followed by the evolution of large brains, but the sequence isn't controversial any more. Its been empirically demonstrated.\n \n \nYou see DNA tests and fossils wont tell us if our alleged descendants had the spirits of humanity in them that separates us from the animals kingdom.\n\n \n It is true that religious speculations about so-called spirits are outside the domain of science. However, we do know that we are evolved animals, whatever the priests, shamans and other workers of voodoo prefer to claim. What binds us to the rest of the animal kingdom is far more elemental than what separates us.\n \n \nMy question is this, how can you deny the hand of an intelligent designer who designed the original ability for so many diverse trees, with so many diverse types of seeds to scatter them in so many unique yet successful ways ? It boggles the mind that such creative survival techniques could be found in the simplest life form that doesn't even have a brain. I await your excuses, er uh, I mean responses. :)\n\n \n I deny it because I see no evidence for it, and do not need it in place of a naturalistic, evolutionary explanation, which is sufficient to account for the data. God hypotheses I leave to witch doctors!\n \n Trees do not make seeds or fruit to feed chipmunks or birds. They make seeds to propagate their own species, and if you notice, their seeds are often extremely hard to get at, and are often poisonous to many species that might otherwise eat them -- wild almonds, for example. They make them difficult to get at to discourage feeding by animals, for heavens sakes, not to supply beasts with food. That some animals circumvent the precautions is hardly surprising, nor is it surprising that some trees adapt and use animals to propagate seeds.\n \n For example, fruiting trees have discovered, by a process of naturalistic trial and error, that if they cover their seeds with a tasty treat, then birds and animals will consume the fruit, let the seed pass through their alimentary tract, and then disperse it to take root elsewhere. They are using the animals, not altruistically feeding them!\n \n Let me ask you a question in turn. Why do you insist on a Tinkerer God who has to keep suspending the laws of nature and interfering with the evolution of his creation to get what he wants, rather than a god ingenious enough to just set evolution in motion, and sit back and enjoy the results?\n \n At any rate, you basically have two choices based on evidence: there is either no god guiding biological creation every step of the way; or there is a god who operates in a manner indistinguishable from naturalistic evolution. I just dispense with the extra deity.",

   "... it's an _informed_ ideological opinion that I can defend rationally.\n\n \n Well, if you do, let me know. Since you seem to have ignored my question, I'll ask it again: What is your evidence for a teleological component to evolution, and how does it universally disprove all cases of natural selection?\n \n \nThere is absolutely no scientific evidence of any kind, anywhere, that supports the darwinist postulate that a mystical something called \"Natural Selection\" is the physical force/mechanism, that causes, directs, guides and controls biological evolution.\n\n \n Well, if you are the sort of person who will ideological deny the existence of evidence that every biologist can see, then no evidence will be sufficient for you. As a biologist, all I can say is that any reasonable person finds the evidence for natural selection being the major biological sieve leading to adaptation very compelling. I know of no equally compelling evidence for directed mutation. Do you? If you do, what is it?\n \n \nAll claims to the contrary rest upon the vacuous 'ex post facto' truism, and tautology, that the strong survive while the weak perish, without ever providing a universal mechanism to determine what makes a 'winner' strong, and a 'loser' weak, in terms of adaptation and survival.\n\n \n Nope. Biologists spend a lot of time demonstrating how natural selection results in adaptations. They don't just assume it; they test it in the lab and the field through experimentation and observation. They can actually watch species gradually adapt in real time, generation after generation, and that includes microbes, plants and animals. Read the literature, especially the microbial lit. Treatises on animal breeding are also helpful.\n \n \nSorry, but you and your fellow darwinists conflate the terms, 'evolution' and \"the Darwinian Theory of Evolution\", treating them as synonyms, every single chance you get. \n\n \n Nope. We don't. I certainly haven't. That's simply a false statement, but you refuse to be corrected.\n \n \nAnd I never claimed that biologists did it, only that darwinists do it constantly and with no qualm of conscience for their duplicity.\n\n \n All biologists are Darwinians to the extent that they accept that natural selection is a force driving a lot of evolution. Even the most insistent Darwinian, however, acknowledges that it isn't the only force. Not even Darwin claimed it was the only force. You are setting up a straw man as usual.\n \n \nI can defend my premises\n\n \n You haven't defended a single one. You've been attacking straw men of your own construction because it's easier than doing actual research of the literature, or heaven forfend, your own experiments.\n \n \nI've got lots of evidence that shows that organisms adapt themselves, dynamically, to their changing environments, and are not so adapted, passively, by something mystical that darwinists call \"Random Mutation and Natural Selection\".\n\n \n If you bothered to read any biology, you'd be aware of the vast body of work that studies how individual animals and plants adapt themselves to changing environments. The phenomenon is called phenotypic plasticity, is well known, and thanks to molecular genetics, is now better understood than ever before. However, the ability of many individual organisms to adapt their bodies in some limited way to a changing environment is not an explanation for the evolution of new species, which is what Darwin was addressing. If you recall, his seminal work was entitled Origin of Species, and not Adaptation of Organisms. Evolution of new species requires for breeding isolation, and so far as we know, permanent changes to the genome.\n \n Further, there is nothing mystical about mutation, random or otherwise, which is a very well understood and documented phenomenon, nor natural selection, which has been demonstrated in many systems in both the laboratory and the field. These are facts of life. Get used to them.\n \n So once again, let me give you another chance to answer the question, instead of dodging it in a flurry of windy rhetoric: What is the evidence for a teleological component to evolution? Give me some real world examples of teleology that cannot possibly be explained by a Darwinian mechanism, or one of the several other mechanisms that are believed to drive evolution, such as structural constraints or genetic drift. The only way you'll convince me is through evidence.\n \n If you can't, then all you accomplish is to demonstrate the depth of your groundless faith in the miracle of teleological design, and are no better than an adversarial, IDist evolution-denier with no scientific contributions of his own.",

A clear case of teleological cause and effect.\n \n Now let me follow your lead and ask you in your turn--What is your evidence for ateleological evolution, whereby organisms are mere passive clay changed by accident and conserved by lucky coincidence, i.e., RMNS? And, how does the fact of evolution demonstrate the reality of its hypothetical cause, i.e., your notional, \"natural force\", that you label natural selection? Why don't you start by trying to express what is meant by 'natural selection' in non-metaphysical, i.e., empirical, scientific, terms? And yes, I do know that I'm asking you to do the impossikble\n \n \n\n Quote:\n There is absolutely no scientific evidence of any kind, anywhere, that supports the darwinist postulate that a mystical something called \"Natural Selection\" is the physical force/mechanism, that causes, directs, guides and controls biological evolution. \n \n \n Well, if you are the sort of person who will ideological deny the existence of evidence that every biologist can see, then no evidence will be sufficient for you. As a biologist, all I can say is that any reasonable person finds the evidence for natural selection being the major biological sieve leading to adaptation very compelling. I know of no equally compelling evidence for directed mutation. Do you? If you do, what is it?\n\n \n \n **\n Here's a thought--instead of blustering on and on about the 'evidence' that \"anyone can plainly see\" that supports natural selection as an empirically real cause, mechanism, that results in what non-darwinists call evolution, i.e., the origins of novel traits in organisms, why don't you try to present this hypothetical 'evidence', and try to show why what you call 'evidence' really is 'evidence' for the reality of 'natural selection' as the causal mechanism for the origins of organismic novelty over time[i.e., _evolution_]?. My bet is you'll just blow the usual darwinist smoke without saying anything to the point.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n All claims to the contrary rest upon the vacuous 'ex post facto' truism, and tautology, that the strong survive while the weak perish, without ever providing a universal mechanism to determine what makes a 'winner' strong, and a 'loser' weak, in terms of adaptation and survival. \n \n \n Nope. Biologists spend a lot of time demonstrating how natural selection results in adaptations.\n\n \n **\n Nope. They spend about as much of their time doing that as you've spent doing it in these threads--which is none at all.\n \n \n\n They don't just assume it; \n\n \n **\n Yes, they do \"just assume it\". See the 'peppered moth' and 'Galapagos finch', Luria and Delbruck , and on and on, for clear evidence that a/they assume \"natural selection\" as a natural 'cause' of organismic change, 'a priori', and b/they arbitrarily interpret their observations so as to make them appear to support that arbitraily, (i.e., ideologically), adopted 'a priori' position.\n \n \n\n they test it in the lab and the field through experimentation and observation.\n\n \n **\n Sez u. Show us this vaunted \"experimentation and observation\", and explain how it actually supports your \"NS\" as the cause of the appearance organismic novelty over time, (i.e., evolution).\n \n \n\n They can actually watch species gradually adapt in real time, generation after generation, and that includes microbes, plants and animals.\n\n \n **\n Of course they can!! It's called, \"evolution\", doncha know?!? But, for the hundredth time, the fact of evolution is not 'evidence' for your hypothetical explanation, (i.e., \"natural selection\") for its own cause. As always, you ccommit the darwinist folly of conflating a real effect with your own notional cause for that effect, that is, you habitually and irrationally conflate organismic evolution with your own 'natural selection' explanation for it.\n \n \n\n Read the literature, especially the microbial lit. Treatises on animal breeding are also helpful.\n\n \n **\n You assume that I'm unfamiliar with the literature. Bit presumptuous and condescending of you, wouldn't you say?\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Sorry, but you and your fellow darwinists conflate the terms, 'evolution' and \"the Darwinian Theory of Evolution\", treating them as synonyms, every single chance you get. \n \n \n Nope. We don't.\n\n \n **\n Yup. You do. Constantly.\n \n \n\n I certainly haven't.\n\n \n **\n Yes, you have. Repeatedly.\n \n \n\n That's simply a false statement, but you refuse to be corrected.\n\n \n **\n No, yours is simply a false statement, but you refuse to be corrected. I've pointed out several instances where you do exactly what you deny doing. \n \n \n\n Quote:\n And I never claimed that biologists did it, only that darwinists do it constantly and with no qualm of conscience for their duplicity. \n \n \n All biologists are Darwinians to the extent that they accept that natural selection is a force driving a lot of evolution.\n\n \n **\n That's another false statement. And who cares if 'most' biologists buy into your NS nonsense/ It's still nonsense; it's just very popular nonsense. Like certain religious beliefs I could name.\n \n \n\n Even the most insistent Darwinian, however, acknowledges that it isn't the only force. Not even Darwin claimed it was the only force. You are setting up a straw man as usual.\n\n \n **\n If I'm \"setting up a strawman\", then it will be very easy to show that I am. All cyou have to do is, A/ Show how \"Natural Selection\" is a universal, alocal, regular efficient cause for the origins of organismic novelty over time (i.e., evolution), and B/, describe any other universal, alocal, efficient cause for this organismic evolution that is accepted by Darwinists, and C/ demonstrate conclusively that any and all 'causal forces' for evolution that are postulated and accepted by darwinists do not reduce themselves to chance genetic accidents and lucky environmental coincidences.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n I can defend my premises \n \n \n You haven't defended a single one.\n\n \n \n **\n Another false statement.\n \n \n\n You've been attacking straw men of your own construction because it's easier than doing actual research of the literature, or heaven forfend, your own experiments.\n\n \n **\n Yaddayaddayadda.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n I've got lots of evidence that shows that organisms adapt themselves, dynamically, to their changing environments, and are not so adapted, passively, by something mystical that darwinists call \"Random Mutation and Natural Selection\". \n \n \n If you bothered to read any biology, you'd be aware of the vast body of work that studies how individual animals and plants adapt themselves to changing environments. The phenomenon is called phenotypic plasticity, is well known, and thanks to molecular genetics, is now better understood than ever before.\n\n \n **\n I'm well aware of phenotypic plasticity. This may shock you, perhaps even disturb your dogmatic self-assurance, but phenotypic plasticity is a neo-lamarckian broadside into the leaking barge of darwinist speculation. And genetics have been informed by phenotypic plasticity, not the other way round, as you falsely believe.\n \n \n\n However, the ability of many individual organisms to adapt their bodies in some limited way to a changing environment is not an explanation for the evolution of new species, which is what Darwin was addressing.\n\n \n **\n sez u. I say it is the only scientific explanation for organismic evolution in sight, and that even Chucky D., realizing that his \"NS\" in no way accounted for origins, co-opted such Lamarckian thought with his \"pangenesis\".\n \n You know, you'd present a better case if you actually took time to first learn something about evolution from the available literature.\n \n \n\n If you recall, his seminal work was entitled Origin of Species, and not Adaptation of Organisms.\n\n \n **\n That's ol' chuck for ya--title a book \"origins\", and then say nothing about them.\n \n \n\n Evolution of new species requires for breeding isolation, and so far as we know, permanent changes to the genome.\n\n \n \n **\n Sentence inarticulate. My best guess is that it says nothing pertinent, anyway. We are debating darwinism, not evolution itselrf, although you appear to once again conflate the two.\n \n \n\n Further, there is nothing mystical about mutation, random or otherwise, which is a very well understood and documented phenomenon,\n\n \n **\n The notion that entropic system [genome] failure of accidental origin [genetic mutation] can and does, via spontaneous generation, account for organismic novelties that are coincidentally adaptive to some chaotically arising environmental conditions, is pure, unadulterated [with science] metaphysics. \n \n \n\n nor natural selection, which has been demonstrated in many systems in both the laboratory and the field. These are facts of life. Get used to them.\n\n \n **\n These are not \"facts\" at all, but mere darwinist dogma. Get used to the truth, for a change.\n \n \n\n So once again, let me give you another chance to answer the question, instead of dodging it in a flurry of windy rhetoric: What is the evidence for a teleological component to evolution?\n\n \n **\n Scientific experimentation and observation of the fact that evolution takes place, when and if it takes place, as an immediate organismic response to a proximate local environmental stimulus, enabled by a universal property found in all live organisms, but no dead ones. I call this universal, causal, enabling, natural force, \"Vitality\";-- for obvious reasons.\n \n Now you show me science that proves that evolution is caused by spontaneously generated genetic accidents that are coincidentally, fortuitously, adaptive to chaotically arising local environmental conditions, as luck would have it.\n \n \n\n Give me some real world examples of teleology that cannot possibly be explained by a Darwinian mechanism,\n\n \n **\n Your so-called \"Darwinian mechanism\", i.e., spontaneous generation generation by random accident, RMNS, \"explains\" anything and everything and nothing at all. That is why it is scientifically bankrupt. Here's a challenge--present any natural phenomena, in biology or anywhere else, from Huguenots to horseraces, that your \"Darwinian mechanism\" cannot \"explain\".\n That is, rationalize into some specious \"understanding\", or other. \n \n \n\n or one of the several other mechanisms that are believed to drive evolution, such as structural constraints or genetic drift.\n\n \n **\n Structural constrainsts don't drive evolution; to the contrary, they restrain, restrict, and to a great degree, prevent it. How come you guys always get such simple concepts completely bass-ackward?\n \n As for your genetic drift, that's just genomic entropy in some sorry cases, or is an internally generated identity factor in others (see 'ring species'), one that is connected to sexual, (i.e., real organismic, intelligent and volitional, not \"natural\", selection), and, most importantly is, in vitally adaptive cases, (say flightless birds, for example), is a clear instance of the principle of energy conservation and efficiency in complex, self-modulating systems that is referred to in neo-lamarkian terms as \"use it or lose it\".\n \n As always you leap to the darwinian 'a priori' metaphysical assumption, i.e., dogma, that genes change organisms, rather than organisms change genes.\n \n \n\n The only way you'll convince me is through evidence.\n\n \n **\n You are a 'true-believer' in your way to the same extent that archangel is a 'true-believer' in his. There is absolutely no chance that observed fact and rational, logical interpretation of those facts will ever shake either of your two faiths. You couldnt, either of you, do that even if you wanted to. It would require some traumatic event that would shake your respective worldviews into pieces. I have no idea what such an event might be.\n \n \n\n If you can't, then all you accomplish is to demonstrate the depth of your groundless faith in the miracle of teleological design, and are no better than an adversarial, IDist evolution-denier with no scientific contributions of his own.\n\n \n **\n Right back atcha.",

   "Nothing about evo is a proven fact. The evidence for that is the constant corrections and adjustments in order to try to maintain consistency in the face of new evidence. And also why it's still referred to as a THEORY!!! You people have so deluded yourselves that even you can't keep the fairy tale straight so that you forget and consider it a forgone conclusion that it's actually a fact to be relied on. When you fill in all the gaps, get back to me and I'll become a believer. I guess we have a date in about, well, never... emoticon_xangel\n\n \n Come on Arch, those are some of the oldest tricks in the book!\n \n 1) Science doesn't deal in absolute proof or absolute truth; only the best explanations we currently have for the available data. You may, I suspect, see this limitation as a weakness, but I see it as a great strength because it allows a greater degree of focus on any given area of study. By these criteria, evo is one of the strongest theories by far. \n \n 2) Scientists expect and (mostly!) enjoy the \"constant corrections and adjustments\" that need to be made to all theories as time goes by, because new data becomes available over time. This is the very cornerstone of the scientific method; its ability to change direction. This is another great strength. Of course when new data doesn't seem immediately to fit with current theory, scientists do their damndest to find out how to alter the theory so it does fit, but if it really, really doesn't fit (most ususally if it falsifies one of the theory's major predictions (remember my evidence+predictions post?) then new theories have to be thought of. \n \n 3) Come on now. Seriously. :) I don't believe you actually used the 'it's just a theory' argument. You must have heard the response a thousand times, and it's basically answered in my point (1) anyway: A theory is as good as you ever get in science. A theory is by definition very well-supported, self-consistent, and preferably highly consilient with other theories. Evo is all of these.\n \n 4) If evo is wrong, then the only thing that could really put the nails in its coffin is another theory that better explains all the evidence of \n \n * The nested hierarchy of species\n * Biological homologies\n * The geographical relationships of the distribution of species\n * Vestigial biological structures\n * The age of life on earth\n * The role of DNA\n * The fossil record\n * Transitional fossils\n * Observed speciation\n \n as well as others. These are all very intriguing phenomena and are all predicted, described and explained extremely well, and in great detail, by the aspects of evo theory that have been developed over 150 years.\n \n I'm not trying to insult you; I have no wish to get into the usual mud-slinging matches that so often occur, which is why I have only recently started regularly posting on the evo-creo section. That said, I have to add that I have read a huge number of these kinds of debates and unfortunately what is really striking every single time, is how little those who argue against evo actually know about what the theory does and (especially) does not say, about the scientific method in general and in particular how much of a great deal of modern science would not make a lot of sense if you take all the evidence and theory for evo out of the picture.\n \n I'll say it again: Given the high degree of consilience, the strength of the evidence and the rigour of the methodology, if you reject evolution and apply that standard with 100% integrity, you will find that you are forced to reject most, if not all of science.",

We compared morphological and life-history traits in populations of Daphnia with a known history of introduced salmonids and populations that have no history of salmonid introductions.\n \n Results\n \n Our results show that Daphnia populations co-existing with fish have undergone rapid adaptive reductions in body size and in the timing of reproduction. Size-related traits decreased by up to 13 percent in response to introduced fish. Rates of evolutionary change are as high as 4,238 darwins (0.036 haldanes).\n \n Conclusion\n \n Species introductions into aquatic habitats can dramatically alter the selective environment of native species leading to a rapid evolutionary response. Knowledge of the rates and limits of adaptation is an important component of understanding the long-term effects of alterations in the species composition of communities. We discuss the evolutionary consequences of species introductions and compare the rate of evolution observed in the Sierra Nevada Daphnia to published estimates of evolutionary change in ecological timescales.\n And if daphnia don't convince you, here's another guy who's written several papers on evolutionary changes in the life cycle of Trinidadian guppies in response to natural selection by predation:\n \n David Reznick:\n My general interest is in studying the process of evolution by natural selection from an experimental perspective and testing evolutionary theory in natural populations. I primarily work on guppies from the Caribbean Island of Trinidad. Guppies are found in high and low predation environments that differ in the species of predators that guppies co-occur with. This contrast is found repeatedly in different drainages and the different predation regimes are often right next to one another, separated by a waterfall. Guppies from high predation environments experience much higher mortality rates. High mortality is associated with earlier maturity, a higher rate of investment of resources in reproduction, and the production of more and smaller offspring. All of these differences have a genetic basis. Mortality rates can be manipulated by either introducing guppies from high predation localities into sites from which they and their predators had previously been excluded by waterfalls, thus lowering mortality rates, or by introducing predators into low predation sites over barrier waterfalls, thus increasing mortality rates. Such experiments have shown that live histories evolve as predicted by theory and in a fashion that is consistent with the earlier comparative studies They have also shown that evolution by natural selection can be remarkably fast, on the order of four to seven orders of magnitude faster than inferred from the fossil record. I am currently studying the evolution of aging in this same system.\n These are just three of hundreds of examples of biologists measuring and quantitating the effect of natural selection on evolution, and attempting to explain HOW natural selection works, rather than just assuming it does.\n \n And if you think it still isn't natural selection, perhaps you could explain to me, meaningfully and scientifically, what it is.",

   "\n Not. I don't think that word means what you think it means.\n\n \n **\n What word? Evolution? Actually 'evolution', outside the boundaries of darwinism, means precisely what I say it means, and always has done. Darwin , the stock-breeding English gent, said that evolution was just Mother Nature doing her own stock-breeding out in the wild, away from the pens. He called the mystical work done by this demi-goddess, \"Natural Selection\", and he founded this mystic process on the ancient agricultural belief about inheritance called 'blending'. This notion stipulated that all creatures are originally gifted with all traits possible to them, and 'breeding' consisted soley of subtracting unwanted traits from 'the mongrels', or 'commoners', and so creating the 'thoroughbreds' or 'aristocracy'; elites that possessed only the best, the most 'noble', traits. An elitist notion, equivalent to the 'xtian' notion of 'the saved' and 'the damned', which lead directly to eugenics, nazi death-camps, and just about every right-wing political party's most fundamental understanding of 'the human condition'.\n \n When people pointed out to Chuck the flaw that I still have to point out to his followers, (that is, that evolution refers to the emergence of novel traits in organic morphology and/or behaviour, and not simply the numerical fluctuations of one 'desired' inherited trait over some other 'undesirable' inherited trait), and asked him where he got the brass to call his book 'origins', when it ignored 'origins' completely, he simply attempted to rectify his failure by plagiarizing the ancient explanation of novelty expressed by Lamarck. He took credit for it, as was his usual habit, by simply giving it a different name,-- \"pangenesis\". Just as he has already done with 'breeding', by calling it 'evolution'.\n \n To eliminate any teleological lamarckian influence in evolutionary theory following the rise of Mendelian inheritance theory, geneticist statisticians [see Ronald Fisher, et al], adopted 'spontaneous generation by entropic genomic system failure', aka, \"random genetic mutation\", as the, you should forgive the expression, \"explanation\" for the mechanism generating biological novelty, 'origins'. This pretext then allowed \"Natural Selection\" to be rescued by materialists from the rubbish heap of science history, along with fresh pretensions that it really had something to do with the evolution of original bioforms and abilities.\n \n Then Fisher and friends switched Darwin's \"Natural Selection\" of live organisms by \"Mother Nature\", (or \"The Great Flying Spaghetti Monster\", if you prefer), over to 'selection' of bits of inert chemical called 'genes'. And when even that wasn't materialistically reductionist enough, 'alleles'.\n \n Out of this arose the new darwinist definition of evolution, now nothing more than the vacuous, \"Evolution is the statistical fluctuation of comparitive allele[acid molecule] frequency within any given local population of genotypes.\" Which amounts to nothing more than the old stock-breeder's notion that Darwin adopted, i.e., 'blending', in which 'evolution' equates to 'breeding', the subtraction of some biological traits compared to the retention others over generations. As said before, that corruption has nothing whatsoever to do with the original and true meaning of evolution, i.e., the ORIGIN of _novel_ traits and behaviours. \n \n \n\n What happens during the evolution of new species is populations throw up a number of variants.\n\n \n **\n \"Throw up\"!!?! What the heck is that supposed to mean? Do they \"spontaneously generate\" novel variants that are more in keeping with the necessities of the local environment? That would be evolutionary, alright, but \"spontaneous generation\" is just an irrational, even mystical, explanation for it. It can be reduced to the less than scientific bumper-sticker, \"It just happens, that's all!\".\n \n Or do you mean that the 'random' sexual mixing of genes/acids from two different sources [conveniently ignoring the non-sexually reproducing members of the biosphere] 'spontaneously generates' completely new acid/gene/allele variants?\n If so, see above.\n \n Or do you mean that natural 'breeding' takes place, wherein nothing original or novel _evolves_ at all, but simply that, thanks to local environmental pressures, some of the old and extablished inherited morphologies cope better with the present local conditions than other inherited traits? Which has nothing to do with actual 'evolution', (ie., ORIGINS), as the non-population geneticist/darwinist world understands that word. You might as well claim that 'evolution', by your definition, applies every time a farmer adds a brown chicken to a flock of white or black ones, or when brown hens mate with white roosters to produce mottled chicks!! That, my friends, is ridiculous.\n \n \n\n Some breed more effectively than others in a given environment, and so their genes come to dominate the population.\n\n \n \n **\n So what? As above that's not evolution, that's simple breeding, as per the 'blending', or subtractive, theory of inheritance. Evolution is about creativity, not comparitive statistical rates of destruction.\n \n \n \n\n This is a wholly separate issue from the individual adaptability of an organism to some limited and regular (or previously experienced) environmental change, such as change of season or salinity.\n\n \n **\n Like I didn't know that? Your problem is that you don't know that 'phenotypic plasticity' applies to much more than inherited, genetically established and determined, capacity for colour change or whatever. \"Phenotypic plasticity\", for your information, is also important in developmental biology and the epigenetic mechanisms in play wrt organismic morphology and behaviour. It is these newly found epigenetic mechanisms that are the key to the non-darwinian mechanism for evolution, i.e., the inherent ability of the organism to direct its own morphology and behaviour in response to present needs or opportunities found in its immediate environment.\n \n You will claim that these epigentic developmental mechanisms for phenotypic plasticity are all completely under genetic control, but the fact is, they are not, but rather, are largely organismically responsive to environmental stimuli, in a lamarckian, not a darwinian, sense.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Now you show me science that proves that evolution is caused by spontaneously generated genetic accidents that are coincidentally, fortuitously, adaptive to chaotically arising local environmental conditions, as luck would have it. \n \n \n I think the simplest thing for me to do is link you to a web page where microbial evolution is discussed:\n\n \n **\n It certainly would be the easiest and laziest thing for you to do, but don't try 'arguing by link' on me. Present your arguments in this forum, yourself.\n Feel free to quote from certain papers that you feel support your argument, showing, of course, just exactly and specifically how they do so. Or, for general interest's sake only, supply links you think people might enjoy reading; but do not think that by pointing to a link and ordering us all back to _your_ school that you have presented anything like a real argument, at all.\n I'll just ignore that kind of ploy.\n \n \n \n\n Richard Lenski's lab isn't the only one involved in observing the appearance of mutations and selection in microbes, but it has done some outstanding work in the evolution of bacteria by natural selection, and would be a good place to start.\n\n \n **\n Unread, as per above.\n \n \n\n If bacteria aren't good enough, there's another interesting experimental system with daphnia and fish here (and it's only one of many):\n \n Rapid evolution in response to introduced predators I: rates and patterns of morphological and life\n\n \n **\n Oh, man, I have to love it!! Don't you get it?! \"Rapid evolution\" is contrary to darwinian \"gradualism\" (necessitated by darwinian dependence upon random genetic mutation as the root cause of evolution), just to start with. Secondly, the word \"responsive\" indicates an entirely different evolutionary mechanism, a neo-lamarckian mechanism, which is contrary to the darwinian word for your supposed mechanism, which is \"selection\". So whether the author realizes it or not, his work has an anti-darwinian, pro-lamarckian title!!\n \n There are two ways to look at what happens in this study.\n \n A/ True evolution occurred when novel, totally original morphology and/or behaviours arose in the fish, that had previously not been present in their established phenotype. \n \n B/If nothing like this is observed, then no _evolution_, but only 'breeding',- [a statistical fluctuation in the relative frequency of inherited alleles], - occurred.\n \n \n\n Abstract\n \n Background\n \n Introduced species can have profound effects on native species, communities, and ecosystems, and have caused extinctions or declines in native species globally.

We discuss the evolutionary consequences of species introductions and compare the rate of evolution observed in the Sierra Nevada Daphnia to published estimates of evolutionary change in ecological timescales.\n\n \n **\n From what you've quoted here it would appear that nothing novel or original was generated in the daphnia, and that only B/, i.e., 'breeding', (no evolution at all), took place. A mere statistical fluctuation in the comparitive frequency within the established range of species body size. Which is the same as saying that ponies 'evolved' from horses, when in truth they are nothing but a variety of horse.\n \n However, if the daphnia in fact reduced their size to a novel, original limit, one measurably below the size parameters set by their genetic heritage, then yes, real evolution, albeit only micro-evolution, transpired.\n I can't tell from the citation whether or not this is the case. However, if it is, (and I certainly hope it is!), then it is demonstrated proof that evolution is an organismic response to a proximate environmental stimulus, and not a darwinan happy genetic accident coupled with a 'selective' cull of the unfortunate and unlucky non-mutants.\n \n \n \n\n And if daphnia don't convince you, here's another guy who's written several papers on evolutionary changes in the life cycle of Trinidadian guppies in response to natural selection by predation:\n \n David Reznick:\n \n My general interest is in studying the process of evolution by natural selection from an experimental perspective and testing evolutionary theory in natural populations. I primarily work on guppies from the Caribbean Island of Trinidad. Guppies are found in high and low predation environments that differ in the species of predators that guppies co-occur with. This contrast is found repeatedly in different drainages and the different predation regimes are often right next to one another, separated by a waterfall. Guppies from high predation environments experience much higher mortality rates. High mortality is associated with earlier maturity, a higher rate of investment of resources in reproduction, and the production of more and smaller offspring. All of these differences have a genetic basis. Mortality rates can be manipulated by either introducing guppies from high predation localities into sites from which they and their predators had previously been excluded by waterfalls, thus lowering mortality rates, or by introducing predators into low predation sites over barrier waterfalls, thus increasing mortality rates. Such experiments have shown that live histories evolve as predicted by theory and in a fashion that is consistent with the earlier comparative studies They have also shown that evolution by natural selection can be remarkably fast, on the order of four to seven orders of magnitude faster than inferred from the fossil record. I am currently studying the evolution of aging in this same system.\n These are just three of hundreds of examples of biologists measuring and quantitating the effect of natural selection on evolution, and attempting to explain HOW natural selection works, rather than just assuming it does.\n\n \n **\n Once again, I love it. Please keep supplying scientific evidence like this, that destroys, albeit all unawares, your darwinian 'passive selection' mechanism, and supports my lamarckian 'dynamic organic response' mechanism.\n \n \n\n And if you think it still isn't natural selection, perhaps you could explain to me, meaningfully and scientifically, what it is.\n\n \n **\n I'll try, but you won't understand it any better this time than you ever have. Still, here goes--\n \n Evolution only takes place when a morphological or behavioural trait appears in one or more organisms that cannot be accounted for within the range/parameters of possible variants in their inherited genotype. If there is a novel variation that is strictly quantitative, that is, there is more or less of the same trait, but more or less of it than than inherited alleles can account for, then micro-evolution can be said to occurred. If a major, robust physiological change occurs, in form and function, (such as a penguin's flight wing changing into a swimming flipper), then macro-evolution can be said to have occurred.\n \n When evolution, micro or macro, as described above, does _not_ occur, but rather, only a simple arithmetic differential in established inherited phenotypes and standard behaviours occurs, then either 'breeding' or 'learning' has occurred, as forms of 'adaptation'. The darwinist mistake is to commonly confuse and conflate 'adaptation' with 'evolution' itself. I have not 'evolved' simply because I have learned not to shovel snow in my bare feet. Neither has 'evolution' occurred because I have bred my horses to be faster than yours.\n \n Now, since even Darwin was forced to admit that his \"Natural Selection\" did not generate original traits, had nothing to do with 'origins', and thus nothing to do with evolution, but only to do with 'breeding', , it is plainly evident that \"Natural Selection\" has nothing to do with actual biological evolution, but solely to do with the statistical differentials between inherited variations--aka, 'breeding'. Data of great use in ecology, but nothing to do with evolution itself.\n \n Whether your examples point to true evolution, even micro-evolution, and not mere 'breeding', is up to those who read your cited material to decide for themselves. But the fact remains that if real evolution did take place, \"Natural Selection\" had nothing to do with producing it.",

   "The definition of evolution, my dear chap, is best defined as Darwin defined it: Descent with modification. Indeed, Darwin didn't coin the word evolution at all, that was Huxley and others. Descent, of course, implies breeding for sexually reproducing organisms, or parthenogenesis for non-sexual organisms. Modification, as we now know, means genetic alterations, and perhaps epigenetic ones. Genetic alterations are various kinds of alterations in the DNA sequence, arising from well-known causes.\n \n \nWhat word? Evolution? \n\n \n No. Teleology.\n \n And there's nothing \"mystical\" about natural selection, as biologists demonstrate how it happens all the time.\n \n \nTo eliminate any teleological lamarckian influence in evolutionary theory following the rise of Mendelian inheritance theory, geneticist statisticians [see Ronald Fisher, et al], adopted 'spontaneous generation by entropic genomic system failure', aka, \"random genetic mutation\", as the, you should forgive the expression, \"explanation\" for the mechanism generating biological novelty, 'origins'.\n\n \n They didn't just \"adopt\" it to satisfy some abstruse metaphysics, they demonstrated it empirically. Genetic novelty by mutation is an established fact.\n \n \nOut of this arose the new darwinist definition of evolution, now nothing more than the vacuous, \"Evolution is the statistical fluctuation of comparitive allele[acid molecule] frequency within any given local population of genotypes.\"\n\n \n Well, what else is it? New species arise because of permanent genomic changes, and the only known way those changes can arise is by mutation, whatever the cause of the mutation. Indeed, that's the biological definition of a mutation, a change in the DNA sequence!\n \n \nWhich amounts to nothing more than the old stock-breeder's notion that Darwin adopted, i.e., 'blending', in which 'evolution' equates to 'breeding'\n\n \n No, it doesn't. Blending refers to a theory of inheritance common prior to the rediscovery of genes. Darwin didn't know anything about genes. As for evolution being about selective breeding, of course it is, though Darwin had the wrong theory about heredity. It's just that natural selection as opposed to artificial selection is accomplished through the passive action of environmental constraints that affect breeding success, and not by intelligent planning.\n \n \nDo they \"spontaneously generate\" novel variants that are more in keeping with the necessities of the local environment?\n\n \n There is copious evidence for spontaneous, apparently random (i.e. non-directed) mutation with each generation. There is no evidence that new mutations ever follow the \"necessities\" of the local environment, though surviving ones do. If some variants happen to make some offspring better adapted, then they'll be likely to breed more effectively, and their genes will have a better chance of survival. It's all about statistics.\n \n \nThat would be evolutionary, alright, but \"spontaneous generation\" is just an irrational, even mystical, explanation for it. It can be reduced to the less than scientific bumper-sticker, \"It just happens, that's all!\".\n\n \n Actually, many biological mechanisms for mutation are known, and have been shown to be responsible for evolutionary changes in the genome. They don't \"just happen\" miraculously, though they happen unpredictably (which is all random means in this context), and they happen all the time, whenever DNA is replicated. Each generation, every offspring contains a few mutations their parent did not have. Fact, not fiction. That the environment deals with these variants differentially is expected, and no surprise.\n \n \nYou will claim that these epigentic developmental mechanisms for phenotypic plasticity are all completely under genetic control, but the fact is, they are not, but rather, are largely organismically responsive to environmental stimuli, in a lamarckian, not a darwinian, sense.\n\n \n First of all, biologists have long known that an organism's phenotype is the result of an interaction between its genes and its environment. Nothing new there. Second, there is absolutely nothing Lamarckian about an individual's adaptation to external conditions. Its ability to adapt is already programmed into its genome. Organisms cannot adapt outside the range permitted by their genes. E.g. even if it would be beneficial for an animal to grow a woolly coat in the winter, if it doesn't have the genes that allow it, it won't do it.\n \n \nI'll just ignore that kind of ploy.\n\n \n Well, I wasn't really expecting you to address any, you know, actual science.\n \n \nUnread, as per above.\n\n \n That seems to sum up your attitude towards science.\n \n \nOh, man, I have to love it!! Don't you get it?! \"Rapid evolution\" is contrary to darwinian \"gradualism\" (necessitated by darwinian dependence upon random genetic mutation as the root cause of evolution), just to start with. \n\n \n Nope. Gradualism is all relative, and Darwinian evolution can happen as easily in years or decades as in millennia or millions of years. it's not restricted to any particular rate or time scale. In fact, evolution in laboratory studies generally seems to operate at much faster rates than in the field, probably because of the simplified conditions.\n \n \nTrue evolution occurred when novel, totally original morphology and/or behaviours arose in the fish, that had previously not been present in their established phenotype.\n\n \n That is precisely what these sorts of studies have demonstrated.\n \n \nA mere statistical fluctuation in the comparitive frequency within the established range of species body size. Which is the same as saying that ponies 'evolved' from horses, when in truth they are nothing but a variety of horse.\n\n \n That is one aspect of evolution -- the change in frequency of alleles. Of course, new alleles come into a population all the time, which is what permits major changes to occur. Daphnia with genes for smaller bodies came to dominate the gene pool. Whether the variant existed before the experiment, or whether it appeared by mutation, isn't really relevant to this particular experiment, which demonstrates the effect of one kind of natural selection on gene frequencies, thus demonstrating one mechanism of Darwinian evolution.\n \n \nEvolution only takes place when a morphological or behavioural trait appears in one or more organisms that cannot be accounted for within the range/parameters of possible variants in their inherited genotype.\n\n \n OK. But surely you mean evolution occurs when an offspring has a different genotype from its parents. After all, most offspring do not inherit the parental genotype without any modification, not even in asexually producing organisms. They will all have some variants as a result of mutation from a variety of causes during DNA replication.\n \n \nIf a major, robust physiological change occurs, in form and function, (such as a penguin's flight wing changing into a swimming flipper), then macro-evolution can be said to have occurred.\n\n \n OK\n \n \nWhen evolution, micro or macro, as described above, does _not_ occur, but rather, only a simple arithmetic differential in established inherited phenotypes and standard behaviours occurs, then either 'breeding' or 'learning' has occurred, as forms of 'adaptation'. The darwinist mistake is to commonly confuse and conflate 'adaptation' with 'evolution' itself.\n\n \n I really have no idea what you mean here, as this first statement is confused. A change in phenotype with the same genotype is not considered to be evolution. You are confusing two different kinds of adaptation. Biologists do not usually confuse evolution with either kind of adaptation, though some are hyperadaptationists. However, there is more to evolution than adaptation, as every biologist already knows.\n \n \nI have not 'evolved' simply because I have learned not to shovel snow in my bare feet.\n\n \n of course not.\n \n \nNeither has 'evolution' occurred because I have bred my horses to be faster than yours.\n\n \n If you have altered gene frequencies through selective breeding to produce a genome that codes for a faster horse, then evolution has occurred. If you have merely trained them to run faster than similar horses with poorer training, then no evolution has occurred.\n \n \nNow, since even Darwin was forced to admit that his \"Natural Selection\" did not generate original traits, had nothing to do with 'origins', and thus nothing to do with evolution, but only to do with 'breeding', , it is plainly evident that \"Natural Selection\" has nothing to do with actual biological evolution, but solely to do with the statistical differentials between inherited variations--aka, 'breeding'. Data of great use in ecology, but nothing to do with evolution itself.\n\n \n That has all the clarity of mud. It's changes in genomes, and perhaps epigenetic changes, that produce novelty and new species. If you didn't have changes in genomes, which include changes in gene frequencies as well as the appearance of new genes, and new combinations of genes, new species would be impossible. Natural selection is merely the sieve that decides which genomes make more effective breeders.\n \n Finally, a brief note on \"Darwinism\" -- it is not what you think it is, or at least, no biologist could be described as a \"Darwinist\" using your straw man definition in a later post. When biologists refer to Darwinian evolution -- never \"Darwinist\", BTW -- they refer to passive selection enforced by some sort of natural constraint supplied by the environment, such as a predator, food source availability, mate preference, climate, etc. That is why they call it natural selection, as opposed to artificial selection by a breeder. Neither do they assume it's the only influence on evolution, and I cannot for the life of me imagine where you got the false impression they do. The literature of evolutionary biology is full of arguments about whether some trait or other is adaptive, and whether it arose under the influence of natural selection or some other cause.\n \n But of course, since you don't read it, you wouldn't know about it.",

In a similar way, Darwin didn't care for Spencer's phrase, \"survival of the fittest.\" Darwin used that only after the 4th edition upon encouragement by Alfred R. Wallace. But even then, he always mad a reference to \"natural selection\" at the same time.",

An ignorant card perhaps but still a lot of laughs. The evolution of humans is perhaps better documented than other linages. After all we are a younger species.
