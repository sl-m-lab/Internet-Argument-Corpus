   "In the decades since young gay men in the United States started dying from a mysterious syndrome in the 1980s, scientists have wondered how and when the AIDS virus arrived. Many scenarios have been proposed, including one early but now-discounted theory that the disease was imported by a promiscuous Canadian flight attendant dubbed \"patient zero.\" \n \n Now, however, scientists reconstructing the genetic evolution of the deadly virus say they have traced its true path -- concluding that the insidious pathogen used Haiti as a steppingstone from Africa to the United States and arrived much earlier than had been thought. It then simmered silently here for more than a decade before it was detected, beginning its global spread along the way. \n \n \"This is the first time that we've been able to bring together the geographical picture with the timing picture to show with a pretty high degree of certainty where the virus went from Africa, and when,\" said Michael Worobey, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona in Tucson, who led the research. \n \n Others praised the detailed genetic analysis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from around the world as an impressive bit of biomedical sleuthing. \n \n \"For those of us who have been interested in HIV evolution and the origins of the virus, this is very interesting,\" said Beatrice H. Hahn, a professor of medicine at the University of Alabama in Birmingham. \"It's a very nice piece of work.\" \n \n In addition to writing a key chapter in the history of the AIDS pandemic, the new insights into the genetic variability of the virus could aid the long-frustrated efforts to develop an effective vaccine. \n \n \"What this might tell us is how the virus might evolve molecularly,\" said Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \"That might have an impact on the virus that you put in your vaccines. So this not only has historical value but practical implications for vaccine design.\" \n \n The new work fills in the latest piece of the puzzle of the origins of the AIDS pandemic. Hahn and her colleagues had previously established that HIV originally jumped from chimpanzees to humans, possibly when hunters in Africa butchered animals infected with a version of the virus. In 2000, Bette Korber of Los Alamos National Laboratory and her colleagues found that the virus began to proliferate in Africans around 1930. \n More at http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/04/AR2007110400959.html?nav=rss_email/components",

But don't you find the \"some of my best friends are...\" conversational ploy, followed by patently offensive remarks about the allegedly disgusting habits of hypothetical \"friends\", is a tad shopworn and unconvincing? \n \n \nThis thread concerns HIV, aids and the spread thereof via anal sex initially and by other means after it became a plague. It seems quite appropriate to speak of anal sex. Do you realize that if gays had never engaged in anal sex that aids might still be a miniscule killer of just a few?\n\n \n Apparently this is news to you, as you aren't a scientist, so let me repeat: anal sex does not cause AIDS. It's a virus called HIV. Anal sex has never been known to spontaneously generate the virus. It's generally safe, so long as neither partner is infected, and condoms are used. It's not \"gay sex\" that causes disease, it's parasites, microbes and viruses that take advantage of any kind of sexual contact between infected people, irrespective of sexual orientation. HIV/AIDS is not \"a gay disease\"; it is not \"an anal sex disease\". HIV doesn't ask people if they're gay or had anal sex before infecting them. Why I have to explain this almost 40 years into the epidemic is beyond me, but it's an important point, as there's a lot of disinformation out there: you will not be safe from HIV if only you avoid anal sex.\n \n As for who or what started the HIV epidemic, genetic studies suggest it probably spread from monkeys or apes to Africans, either male or female (and no-one knows what sexual orientation), probably in the first half of the 20th century, before eventually breaking out and spreading to gay males in the West in the 70s. It is likely that the initial jump across species occurred because monkeys and apes are occasionally on the human menu in Africa, and so blood contact between species regularly occurs. Maybe the promiscuity of some gay males was a factor in this secondary breakout, but it would have broken out at some point, anyway. It just happened to be noticed among Western gay males first. \n \n However, heterosexuals having vaginal sex remains by far the most prevalent mode of infection, worldwide. But you obsess about anal sex...\n \n \n...and I think anal sex is wrong for heterosexuals too. It is not within the bounds of what I call natural behavior. The fact that it is a naturally occuring phenomenon does not make it natural.\n\n \n How can you make a statement that something that occurs in nature \"just ain't natcheral!\" without embarrassment? You really mean that you, personally, do not approve of it, not that it isn't \"natural\". Yet heterosexuals have been using anal sex for ever as a means of contraception. Not all, and probably not even most, use it routinely, but surveys of sexual habits in America suggest that some 20-30% of straight couples practice it occasionally. Given that gay men form less than 5% of the population (and do not always have anal sex with every man they bed), I would guess that, in terms of sheer quantity, there's probably more heterosexual anal sex going on than gay anal sex.\n \n There's a simple solution for your disapproval. Don't participate in it. Everyone's happy.\n \n \nThere is nothing unnatural about oral sex.\n\n \n emoticon_confused \n \n Why ever not? If putting Tab P in Slot A is \"unnatural\" by your arbitrary definition, why is it \"natural\" to put it in Slot O? If it is \"obviously designed\" for Slot V, then Slot O should be equally unacceptable (and legally speaking, it usually has been) -- if you want to argue consistently. But I imagine consistency here isn't the issue for you: anal sex is. Of course, I should point out that all these organs are evolved to be multifunctional, anyway. No-one \"designed\" them to be used only in accordance with some religious instruction manual. I suggest you are misusing the word \"natural\", when what you really mean is \"personally and morally unacceptable\".\n \n \nIf monkeys and humans had not become hedonistically attached to anal sex, we wouldn't be having so many friends die of aids.\n\n \n Aside from the fact I don't know of any evidence that monkeys engage in anal sex (you must be thinking of rams or dogs, and besides, bonobos aren't monkeys), if there weren't a virus called HIV, there wouldn't be any AIDS. Sex is not a cause of disease, not even anal sex. It can only act as an opportunity for infection, and heterosexuals are just as susceptible to it as gay men.\n \n \nI am not a religious person. I was as much as drummed out of town for giving my daughter The Joy of Sex as a wedding present.\n\n \n Well, then, you do a consistently excellent impression of an outraged Christian apologist, and you have admitted to being a Christian. You should try to get over your uptightness about what other people do in bed in private -- they aren't asking to do it with you.",

Anal sex is unnatural.\n \n \n No, it isn't. It's only proscribed by your religion.\n \n \nI am a Christian. I believe in evolution. I believe in natural selection. I do not believe in an inerrant Bible. I believe much leeway was taken in interpretation of what God's words would have been. I believe man evolved. I believe Jesus came and went. I believe He taught that love thy fellow man is THE most important part of human life. NONE OF THE ABOVE has anything to do with the question.\n\n \n It has everything to do with the question of which human behaviours are \"natural\" according to your puzzling and arbitrary code, and which are not. Since your code is based on your religiously inspired morality, and not on nature or any science I'm aware of, your religion is extremely relevant to trying to understand why you have such view that is at odds with the natural behaviour of so many humans, gay or straight.\n \n \nI have not called gays unnatural. I've said that anal sex is unnatural. Anal sex is not confined to gay men. Anal sex is practiced by a lot of heterosexuals. It is unnatural because it is a social construct not included in the bag of reasons that caused our configurations.\n\n \n The reasons you give are arbitrary. You call it \"unnatural\" because your religion condemns it, not because of any objective reason. Nature uses whatever parts are available to generate adaptation; it doesn't refer first to the bible to see if these are going to be considered \"natural\".\n \n \nHow many times must I tell you. God and religion have NOTHING to do with this issue. A scientific, empirical study of the human body is all that is required to conclude that there is only one intended function of the human anus. \n\n \n Experience suggests that you are wrong on both counts. But that isn't unusual, Jim.\n \n \nThe penis and the vagina both provide multiple functions..the vagina has three. I wouldn't call the effluent from the penis sewage though. It's just urine. Sewage is made when you mix the liquid waste from the penis with the solid waste from the rectum.\n \n \n I love this one... it's the physiological version of the \"not a real Christian\" debating ploy. Penis and anus are both principally waste disposal facilities -- I was thinking the old joke about the electrical, mechanical and civil engineers discussing what sort of an engineer god had to be. Turned out he was a civil engineer, because only a civil engineer would think of running a sewage disposal system through a recreational area. \n \n Multifunctionality is common in physiology. If nature hadn't \"intended\" the anus to be erogenous, it wouldn't have made it so, for so many people. Yet there it is, a fact of nature. Maybe yours isn't -- I really don't want an answer to that -- as not all people have the same erotic preferences, but you have no call to make moral judgements of others whose likes and dislikes differ from yours, still less to condemn natural behaviour as \"unnatural\" because it doesn't comport with what you deem appropriate. I can't understand how anyone could bring themselves to slurp down raw oyster, but I'm not out there condemning the practice, even though it disgusts me and carries a considerable risk of food poisoning, as \"unnatural\". And yes, this is a purely moral judgement of yours, otherwise you wouldn't feel a need to camouflage it by calling anal sex \"unnatural\". That is pure value judgment, not objective observation, no matter that you attempt to cloak it as such.\n \n It's no more unnatural than wearing glasses, since our noses, to invert Pastor Pangloss, were obviously intended for breathing.\n \n \nThere you are with the religious defense again. This is not a religious issue with me. \n \n \n So you keep claiming, but you haven't managed to advance a non-religious reason that hasn't been easily refuted. I'd say you are merely unwilling to admit your reasons are religious, hence you rationalise them as being objective, whereas that is far from being the case.\n \n \nYes and yes. I know there's a lot more to being gay that the sex part, whether it's anal or not. I think oral sex is perfectly natural. Kissing is natural. Tongue kissing is natural. Tongue bathing is natural. The skin is the largest organ of the human body and is sensitive in just about every area of the body. It's natural to caress the skin with the lips and tongue and there's no reason to stop when you get to the genitals.\n\n \n More totally arbitrary value judgements. Obviously, the human mouth is intended for eating and speaking, not for slobbering on genitalia to cause orgasms. Whatever makes you think that's \"natural\"? Oh yes... \"just because it is\". I mean, come off it. How many people do YOU know who routinely lick themselves, let alone each others, clean??? Most folk I know wash. It may be natural for beasts to lick everything in sight, but that makes licking each other bestial for us. Get with your own program, Jim! emoticon_xangel \n \n Oh, and if oral sex is \"natural\", is it natural to swallow? After all, sperm and seminal fluid weren't intended for consumption...\n \n \nThat's what I believe. I really don't care that you don't agree with me.\n\n \n When you offer arguments or opinions that make sense, I have no hesitation in agreeing with you. In this case, they don't, and are easily refuted as mere rationalisations of prior bias.",

That does not mean that the intent of the prostate is to provide sexual pleasure. Were that the case, I suspect there would be some auto-lubrication of the anus as there is in the vagina.\n\n And if the female genitalia were designed for receiving oral sex, you wouldn't have lips in the way, would you...\n Perhaps they would be swinging doors instead?\n \n Over and over again, you introduce arbitrary excuses for acknowledging the obvious.\n And you still avoid the question I asked, while still talking about the issue.\n WHY does stimulating the prostate give sexual pleasure?\n What is the \"biological function\" of that, if not involving anal sex?\n \n Quite frankly, you're approach is like refusing to acknowledge the monkey has a tail by saying you'll get to that end of the monkey later, but then complaining that when you look at the hands and the feet you see no tail.\n \n \n \nIt could be more related to taking a dump than to sexual pleasure. Any pleasure that comes from that area could likely be misinterpreted as sexual pleasure.\n\n Seriously NOT the same sensation.\n \n \n \nI've had personal experience with a girl who could be driven to orgasm by simulataneous massage of both feet. That doesn't mean her feet were intended to give sexual pleasure.\n\n Such a judgment can be evaluated also by examining individual reactions to the foot massage.

You seem to think naming one function automatically precludes other functions.\n What is the biological purpose of stimulating the prostate producing sexual pleasure in the context of what you just said was the \"biological function\"?\n Realizing you'll feign incapability to comprehend English, let me just answer for you that stimulating the prostate producing sexual pleasure has NO design function in producing the liquid that carries the sperm.\n Ergo, logically, something else has to be at work...\n \n \n \nSeriously, this is gibberish. Talk with some sense.\n\n It's an analogy.\n If it sounds ridiculous, it's because I'm mimicking the flaw you are perpetrating.\n \n You cannot definitively claim that \"anal sex\" is not a potential biological function when you admit that you have NOT EVEN LOOKED at the evidence for doing so.\n Whether or not you comprehend that flaw is actually irrelevant to me. The fact that others recognize it when I point it out is sufficient for me...\n \n \n \nMaybe you should talk to a lot of women before making such an unbacked claim.\n\n I've talked to a few about their boy-friends. IMO, Gays are a LOT more capable to have frank sex talks about sex with guys than straight guys are, in my experience.\n Part of it has to do with straight guy hang-ups on potential judgment of their technique, and part of it has to do with the girl relaxing on a subject that she knows the guy isn't going to try and use it to some devious advantage later...\n \n Regardless, I meant \"statistically isolated\" with regards to the percentage of the population. Not to judge that she was the only one.\n \n \n \nWhat analogy?The animals you observe in nature likely have no clue what a prostate is...\n\n No problem. The animals don't need to.\n Nor is your observation relevant. You think animals know what their red blood cells are doing?

Why do you think that happened?\n \n \n \n\n And if I study the use of body parts by humans, I can surely conclude that all functions are natural, since unnatural consequences do not ensue. In fact, I'd have to be an idiot not to reach the conclusion that the \"natural\" uses of body parts are the uses to which humans put them to. How could they possibly be \"unnatural\"?\nNatural phenomenon does not equate to natural. You are confusing social constructs with naturalism.\n \n \n \n\n To claim that one arbitrary function -- oral sex -- is \"natural\", while another closely related one -- anal sex or rimming -- is \"unnatural\" -- I'd have to appeal so some judge of aesthetics other than science, such as religion or a prude.\n \n All you are doing is making a transparent attempt to justify your moralistic disdain for certain sex acts by dubbing them \"unnatural\", then getting uppity when supplying outlandish reasons produces incredulous laughter.\nUnless my understanding of rimming is mistaken, I haven't said it was unnatural...just penile penetration is unnatural.",

   "I think you misunderstand. Drop the conscious intent and you will be close. My contention is that it does not matter who or what designed us or the method used to produce us. The only thing that matters is that our parts have different intended functions. These functions can be discerned by study of the body. Surely, you can agree that our legs and feet were intended to aid in our mobility....or that the beak of an eagle was made to tear meat. Do you have to know what precipitated the outcome of the evolution of birds to make that conclusion? Is your admission that there was an intent going to reveal a belief in God? Certainly not. \n\n \n No. Here is where we disagree. \n I guess I don't know how something can be designed without any conscious intent. If there is no conscious intent, it wasn't designed, it merely happened. \n \n No, I cannot agree that our legs and feet were intended to aid in our mobility. That assumes that an intention exists in the first place. It may be merely the use of words here. I can understand using your careful powers of discernment that legs and feet certainly do aid in mobility, but they came about because organisms that move perhaps had a survival advantage over ones that can't. \n \n In addition, we are talking about this on two levels. \n \n One, we are the way we are, because we evolved this way from the way we used to be. There is no overarching design or endpoint or intention. \n \n Secondly, we use the parts we have the way we do. It's that simple. Using our lips to play a kazoo is unnatural (and annoying) but we do it. \n \n Lastly, if something is designed or intended there has to be a designer or an intender with forethought.

The liver likely does all sorts of stuff that we don't know about. Maybe the appendix has a function, maybe not. What is the clearly defined function of that?\n \n Deferring your speculations (on whom or what the grand intender might be) to a separate thread is weaseling out.

Something shaped us the way we are. Each part has a purpose. That purpose was defined by whatever shaped us.\n\n \n Ah. Indeed, I am quite unable, as a rationalist and biologist, to grasp what you mean here by \"intent\", as it's a completely unscientific concept in this context -- it's a religious or philosophical one. You must mean function, not intent or purpose. Evolution and natural selection have neither intent nor purpose. \n \n Then tell us, Jim, why is the anus an erogenous zone for so many people? And why did natural selection make such \"hedonistic\" bonobos that they use forbidden sexual zones for social purposes? Why can't humans use them that way, too?\n \n It's all down to your religious prejudices, Jim, because you haven't made a single, objective, scientific argument yet.\n \n \nNatural phenomenon does not equate to natural. You are confusing social constructs with naturalism.\n\n \n Your \"unnatural\" is the social construct, created from a tired old religious tradition. By my defnition, anything that happens in nature, at whatever frequency, is natural. It may be rare, unusual or common, but it's still natural.\n \n For example, there are many examples in the wild of a male or female pair raising a brood of offspring. This is especially common amongst birds that mate for life, and has been well documented in penguins, swans and seagulls. Often these same-sex parents do have sex together, though at least one needs to have sex with another opposite sex bird to get eggs to clutch. Natural or unnatural, Jim? By my book, it's perfectly natural, though relatively rare, unlike bonobo same-sex behaviour which is probably more common than opposite sex behaviour, but they don't mate for life. \n \n By your idiosyncratic definition of natural vs. unnatural, who knows what classification conclusion you'd reach? I certainly don't.\n \n \nUnless my understanding of rimming is mistaken, I haven't said it was unnatural...just penile penetration is unnatural.\n\n \n Penis no, tongue yes. Golly, THAT makes sense!!! emoticon_xbouncer\n \n Now listen up, gay guys... the penis up the wazzoo is an unnatural no-no, but you can stick your tongue up as far as it can go!

You're quite right. Dogs do it. Mama dogs will lick every puppy in the litter to stimulate a BM...the product of which they will eat (to keep predators from discovering the litter). The lips and tongue seem to be natural stimulators when people cuddle and become more intimate. When performing a tongue bath on an intimate partner, there is no reason to exclude the genitals or the anus. Oral stimulation of any part of the body seems natural to me.\n\n \n Now, how about fingers? If rimming is OK for humans because female dogs do it to puppies, is anal stimulation with a finger natural or unnatural? I mean, I've never known a human female lick her child's anus for any purpose (she would probably get locked up for that in today's sensitive climate!), but I guess she does wash it or wipe it, so I suppose fingers up the anus are natural. Otherwise, of course, delivering suppositories would be unnatural. (Hey! Maybe suppositories ARE unnatural! OK, you hedonists, just deal with your constipation like REAL men, OK?)\n \n Now, you know, erotic stimulation is a two way street. If it is natural and legitimate to stimulate someone's penis with a mouth or fingers, or who knows, breast, foot or any other part of the human anatomy that is clearly \"intended\" for some other purpose -- I mean, you DO regard frottage as natural, right? Or not? it's so hard to predict with you -- then why not with the anus, which is also \"intended\", by your rather wobbly and unstable argument, for something else?\n \n Your humorously contrived arguments here remind me of one of those Creationist nincompoops I once saw on a video trying to prove \"intentionality\" of design. The argument went something along these lines: Look at the banana. It's structured as a polyhedral cylinder clearly designed to fit comfortably and securely into the grasping hand, and is equipped with an efficient zipper mechanism to peel the skin off the fruit with the other! \"Obviously\", this twit went on, the banana was \"intended\" to be eaten by humans!

Anything short of that would be a completely arbitrary double standard and render your justification meaningless. \n \n Alternatively, you could state that, IN YOUR OPINION, anal sex is unnatural, and I for one would be fine with that. You're welcome to that opinion, just as you're welcome to the opinion that the sun orbits the earth. Just don't state it as fact.\n \n My respect for you is dwindling at an astonishing rate. I'm certain that if we were discussing ANY other topic, you would have realized the contradiction/error in your claims and admitted as such. You are many things, but blatantly illogical, or an outright liar, are not on the list to date.\n \n Waxy\nYour respect for me is unimportant to me. Our 24/7 sex drive does not change the OBVIOUS INTENDED functions of body parts. I would expect lovers to caress each other with their tongues...in all places.\n \n \nContinuing with the strawman's I see...\n \n The point is that you cannot come up with ANY CONSISTENT STANDARD by which \"oral sex\" is considered natural, but \"anal sex\" is not considered natural.\n \n So far, it seems that you think that you can show SOME forms of oral stimulation as \"natural\", ergo you assume ALL forms of oral stimulation are natural.\n \n You still haven't shown any consistent argument for why oral sex is natural, which would consistently and logically exclude anal sex as unnatural.\nYou just haven't picked up on it yet. It has to do with natural uses of the tongue and natural use of the anus. They are not the same.\n \n \n \n \nOh? Really?? emoticon_wow What observations would these be?\nAnatomy diagrams, dissections in biology, educational films...all these that I have seen are consistent in descriptions of human body parts.\n \n \n \n\n Ah. Indeed, I am quite unable, as a rationalist and biologist, to grasp what you mean here by \"intent\", as it's a completely unscientific concept in this context -- it's a religious or philosophical one. You must mean function, not intent or purpose. Evolution and natural selection have neither intent nor purpose. \nDo you deny that each organ has at least one function? Do you deny that some of these functions are clearly defined?\n \n What is the function (or functions) of the heart?\n What is the function of the kidneys?\n What is the function of the liver?\n What is the function of the gall bladder?\n \n Start answering that question in regard to every organ you we have. I doubt you can reach a conclusion that completely avoids the concept of INTENT.\n \n \n \n\n Then tell us, Jim, why is the anus an erogenous zone for so many people?\nLikely because it's extremely sensitive to touch.\n \n \n And why did natural selection make such \"hedonistic\" bonobos that they use forbidden sexual zones for social purposes? \nBy your own argument, it was entirely accidental.\nWhy can't humans use them that way, too?\nThey can...and they do. There's nothing FORBIDDEN here...just an unnatural use of the anus.\n \n\n It's all down to your religious prejudices, Jim, because you haven't made a single, objective, scientific argument yet.\nReligion has nothing to do with this. You're just miffed because you can't accept the idea.\n \n \n \n\n Your \"unnatural\" is the social construct, created from a tired old religious tradition. By my defnition, anything that happens in nature, at whatever frequency, is natural. It may be rare, unusual or common, but it's still natural.\nReligion has nothing to do with this. It's more of a common sense look at body parts and their functions. What is your anus supposed to do?\n \n\n For example, there are many examples in the wild of a male or female pair raising a brood of offspring. This is especially common amongst birds that mate for life, and has been well documented in penguins, swans and seagulls. Often these same-sex parents do have sex together, though at least one needs to have sex with another opposite sex bird to get eggs to clutch. Natural or unnatural, Jim? By my book, it's perfectly natural, though relatively rare, unlike bonobo same-sex behaviour which is probably more common than opposite sex behaviour, but they don't mate for life. \nNow you're mixing a lot of parameters into a question regarding one act. Of course it is natural when a same sex couple wants to raise a child. It is natural for same sex couples to exist and love each other. The same sex touching and cuddling is natural. Where the activities becomes unnatural is when anal penetration is introduced. That act (in my humble opinion) is unnatural.\n \n\n By your idiosyncratic definition of natural vs. unnatural, who knows what classification conclusion you'd reach? I certainly don't.\nSee above.\n \n \n \n\n Penis no, tongue yes. Golly, THAT makes sense!!! emoticon_xbouncer\nBased on what I consider to be the obvious INTENDED uses for the tongue and penis (when considering the whole of female and male bodies), it does make sense. Many animals (not just mammals) have been found to use their tongues and mouths in gentle play and tickling as a form of bonding. The penis has other uses, clearly defined by study of the female and male bodies.\n \n\n Now listen up, gay guys... the penis up the wazzoo is an unnatural no-no, but you can stick your tongue up as far as it can go! Jim has set us on the straight and narrow path to naturality!\nNot quite. I don't condemn anyone for practicing anal penetration. I just think it's unnatural.\n \n \n \n \nGeez, that's a pity, because if it was anything like this next one, it must have a doozy of a prevarication!!!\nYou're next one is a misrepresentation.\n \n \n \n\n Now, how about fingers? If rimming is OK for humans because female dogs do it to puppies, is anal stimulation with a finger natural or unnatural? \nI have not said that because dogs do it it's okay for humans. I agreed with you that dogs do it...then expanded a bit on their eating of the excrement. I'm sorry that you took that as a statement of cause regarding why some people do it. Oral stimulation is natural.\n \n \nI mean, I've never known a human female lick her child's anus for any purpose (she would probably get locked up for that in today's sensitive climate!), but I guess she does wash it or wipe it, so I suppose fingers up the anus are natural. \nNo. Fingers up the arse is not natural either.\nOtherwise, of course, delivering suppositories would be unnatural. (Hey! Maybe suppositories ARE unnatural! OK, you hedonists, just deal with your constipation like REAL men, OK?)\nNow you're being silly. A lot of unnatural things are done in the name of health and medical care. It's not a natural state of being to have your stomach opened and your gall bladder removed. That doesn't mean you shouldn't have that done when the gall bladder fails.\n \n \n \n \n\n Now, you know, erotic stimulation is a two way street. If it is natural and legitimate to stimulate someone's penis with a mouth or fingers, or who knows, breast, foot or any other part of the human anatomy that is clearly \"intended\" for some other purpose -- I mean, you DO regard frottage as natural, right? Or not? it's so hard to predict with you -- then why not with the anus, which is also \"intended\", by your rather wobbly and unstable argument, for something else?\nI suppose that as long as there's no penetration, it would be just as natural to rub one's penis against someone's anus. The penetration is unnatural.\n \n\n Your humorously contrived arguments here remind me of one of those Creationist nincompoops I once saw on a video trying to prove \"intentionality\" of design. The argument went something along these lines: Look at the banana. It's structured as a polyhedral cylinder clearly designed to fit comfortably and securely into the grasping hand, and is equipped with an efficient zipper mechanism to peel the skin off the fruit with the other! \"Obviously\", this twit went on, the banana was \"intended\" to be eaten by humans! (Or maybe it was the hand was intended to grasp bananas, or something equally vacuous.)\n \n Keep up the posts, Jim... I haven't laughed this much since my last exchange with the Creo crowd. emoticon_xagree\nGlad to oblige your need for humor. However, my opinions expressed here have nothing to do with creationism or religion. It is merely coincidental that I believe in God.\n \n \n PUBLIC NOTICE:\n \n THE ABOVE WRITINGS ARE OPINIONS.

But then again, our lungs weren't designed for smoking and our brains weren't designed to be manipulated by alcohol and other drugs. What we CHOOSE to do is a lot different than what we were DESIGNED to do.\n \n But homosexuality was specifically NOT provided for in our natural sexual menu, some of us are born with a sexual attraction that points us in that direction and any sex outside of heterosexual coitus is simply a compensatory manifestation of a abnormal situation.\n\n \n This is pure nonsense.

   "Not intentionally for that purpose, though I do agree that its use is usually intended that way. I know no other word that fits as well. How about \"not normal\", \"strange\", \"irregular\"...?\n\n \n As long as you insist on using pejoratives, Jim, people will assume you intend to be pejorative. What you insist on doing is making value judgments, which a scientist will not do. A scientist lets nature answer questions, and doesn't impose his or her own values on it. Nature uses eroticism in various ways, and not just in humans, but in bonobos and even dolphins.\n \n \nI'm just saying that the purpose of he organs were likely there before man became a species. Some were obviously formed for individual specific functions.\n\n \n That doesn't mean that other functions can't arise. All anatomical adaptations occur by changing the function of some pre-existing body part. Wings evolved (independently, several times) from legs, which in turn evolved from fins.\n \n \nThat seems like a contradiction of your claims in the Evo/Creation forum that evolution is entirely accidental. If a species can affect the evolution of itself, there's some design going on.\n\n \n I have never claimed that evolution is \"entirely accidental\" -- natural selection is NOT a random process. Neither would I dream of saying that species \"design\" their own evolution. Maybe humans have that ability, now, but if so, it has never existed previously. Evolution follows the course of least resistance, whatever that is, and adapts by forcing old parts into new roles.\n \n \nFinding a new use for an organ doesn't change its function. Are you saying those reptiles invented a new use for feathers? Just above you said this sounds like a contradiction.\n\n \n If a paleontologist says dinosaurs \"invented a new use\" for feathers, you can be sure she is speaking metaphorically. No dino biotechnologist sat down to plan them. But yes, since the original function of feathers was for something other than flight (their evolutionary kinship with hair and bodily coverage does indeed suggest insulation, and yes, hair, scales and feathers have developmentally similar origins, though it may not be entirely accurate to say that feathers evolved from reptilian scales), then feathers achieved a new function, just as wings function differently from legs, which function differently from fins.\n \n \nNow you sound as if evolution had a consciousness.\n \n That's a good idea.\n\n \n Nothing could be further from my views.",
