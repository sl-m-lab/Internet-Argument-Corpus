Religion and science have co-existed for the most part peacefully for the last several hundred years. Some of the more influential scientists in history were devoutly religious. The myth that they can't both exist simultaneously is an unfortunate misconception on the part of both some religious people and some science-related people and is mostly a pretty new way of thinking (relatively speaking anyway). The key is understanding the roles and limits of each.",
