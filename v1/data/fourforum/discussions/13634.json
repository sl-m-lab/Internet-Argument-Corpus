   "South Carolina shoots holes in gun battle by peddling tax-free weapons for Black Friday\n Michael Daly \n \n \n \n Read more: South Carolina shoots holes in gun battle by peddling tax-free weapons for Black Friday\n The great state of South Carolina is putting its own sick twist on Black Friday with a tax holiday on firearm purchases.\n \n Not cars. \n \n Not clothes. \n \n Certainly not books. \n \n Just guns. \n \n For the 48 hours following Thanksgiving, gun buyers will enjoy a break of up to 9% in state and local taxes. \n \n Firearms traffickers are not expected to pass the savings on to New York criminals, but what is called \"the extrava-gun-za\" and \"Second Amendment Weekend\" is sure to help South Carolina stay among the top five states that provide 85% of the illegal handguns recovered in New York City. \n \n South Carolina shoots holes in gun battle by peddling tax-free weapons for Black Friday",
