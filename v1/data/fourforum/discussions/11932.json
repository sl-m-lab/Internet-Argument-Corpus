   "1976 and 2008 Election Years: A Silver Lining for Conservatives?\n \nAs I write this I'm distressed to say it looks like there is no path to victory for John McCain. But since I prefer to see the glass as half full, I'm searching for something positive to write about tonight's election. Is there anything positive to consider right now?\n \n After careful thought I think so. I think there is still reason for conservatives to hope.\n \n This 2008 election cycle has a remarkable number of parallels to 1976 when Democrat Jimmy Carter beat Republican Gerald Ford. As you may recall, Ford became President following the resignation of scandal-plagued President Richard Nixon. With the Republican brand tarnished by Watergate and the messy war in Vietnam fresh on voters' minds, Carter eked out a 50.1% popular vote and a 297 to 240 electoral win.\n \n As things now stand, Obama appears to be headed for a similarly narrow victory over McCain. As in 1976, the 2008 Republican brand is deeply tarnished by six years of squandered opportunities, wasteful spending, an unpopular Republican President and war that seems to drag on and on. Add in a candidate who had difficulties mobilizing his base and energizing people with a clear vision and you have a recipe for Republican electoral disaster. For Democrats, though, these factors created the perfect storm to sweep into power.\n \n Rewind to 1976. Carter, like Obama was very inexperienced. Little was known about Carter just as little is known about Obama. Contrasting these Democrats were Republicans Ford and McCain who were both tested and experienced leaders. They were, however, dragged down by sweeping calls for change and widespread desire to put a new face and political party in Washington.\n\n \n http://www.ponderstorm.com/2008/11/04/1976-and-2008-election-years-a-silver-lining-for-conservatives/",

   "Um, so Iran is going to stage another mass kidnapping of American personnel and then cut a deal behind the screens to not release them until a Republican president is sworn in?\n \n Just like Iran held onto the 66 hostages until moments after Ronald Wilson Reagan began his inaugural address.\n \n Ah, the October Surprise of 1980:\n \nIn the late stages of the presidential race with Ronald Reagan, Carter, given those new parameters, might have been able to bargain with the Iranians, which might have clinched the election for him. The 11th-hour heroics were dubbed an \"October Surprise\"* by the Reagan camp - something they did not want to see happen.\n \n Allegations surfaced that William Casey, director of the Reagan campaign, and some CIA operatives, secretly met with Iranian officials in Europe to arrange for the hostages' release, but not until after the election. If true, some observers aver, dealing with a hostile foreign government to achieve a domestic administration's defeat would have been grounds for charges of treason.\n \n Reagan won the election, partly because of the failure of the Carter administration to bring the hostages home. Within minutes of Reagan's inauguration, the hostages were released. Under Reagan, the Iran-Contra Affair completes this story.\n\n Iran Hostage Crisis\n \n And, what about the role George H.W. Bush played in this little scenario:\n \nAnother Israeli intelligence officer, Ari Ben-Menashe, said these combined pressures on Begin led the Likud leader to throw in his lot with the Reagan-Bush campaign in 1980 by helping to arrange meetings between Iranian leaders and senior Republicans. Ben-Menashe has asserted that George H.W. Bush personally participated in a key meeting in October 1980 in Paris, a claim that Bush denied at two press conferences in 1992 but was never questioned about in a formal government investigation.\n \n Since then, additional evidence has emerged linking the senior Bush to the clandestine Republican contacts with Iran during the 1980 campaign. Chicago Tribune reporter John Maclean said he was informed by a well-placed Republican Party source in mid-October 1980 that Bush was heading to Paris for a meeting with Iranians about the hostage crisis.\n \n David Andelman, a former New York Times correspondent who was assisting French intelligence chief Alexandre deMarenches on his memoirs, said deMarenches described arranging meetings between Republicans and Iranians in Paris but insisted that be left out of the book for fear it would hurt his friend, George H.W. Bush.\n\n Consortiumnews.com\n \n Assuredly, we must never, ever forget the cozy little Iran/Contra arms deal that Ronald Reagan and his people cut with Iran to reward them for their role in ensuring his successful election as president of the United Sates.",

   "And Reagan's economic policies began the downfall of a vibrant, healthy and powerful America.\nNo. The downfall of our economy can be logically said to have its roots in Democratic liberalism...the social programs being extended into making sure that home loans were available to those voters that could not afford them. Jimmy Carter started it and Bill Clinton greased the skids. I'm sure they both gained a lot of friends in those who sported the new homes and matching flashy cars for several years before going into repossession and foreclosure. It was a nice ride for some of them.\n \n It's the bleeding heart liberal attitude that has ruined our economy this time. It has snowballed into a catastrophic recession that may last for several years...all because the liberal Democrats wanted to 'spread the wealth'.\n \n ...and Obama will continue the tradition, all the while preaching that the Republicans caused this mess.\n \n To answer the OP question, this is deja vu...the Democrats are enabling our future economic woes...again.",
