   "Mumbai massacre has hallmarks of al-Qaeda: US experts\n WASHINGTON: The multiple terror attacks in Mumbai that have killed over 100 people have the &#8220;hallmarks'' of the al-Qaeda, anti-terrorism experts have suggested, even as they indicated other well-known terror outfits with links to Pakistan may be behind t he strikes.\n \n The horrific attacks in Mumbai that have left over hundred people dead and involving a hostage situation has received widespread attention in the American media. Bruce Riedel, a veteran CIA officer and former senior director for South Asia and the Middl e East on the White House National Security Council, said the attacks had the hallmarks of an al Qaeda-affiliated Islamic group such as Lashkar-e Toiba (LeT), which is based in Pakistan and has links to Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency.\n \n &#8220;India has been a major target of terrorism for the last several years, Bombay in particular,'' Riedel, one of the top advisors to US President-elect Barack Obama, has been quoted as saying in The Washington Times. \n\n The Hindu Business Line : Mumbai massacre has hallmarks of al-Qaeda: US experts\n \n If George W. Bush had put period to Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden when he had a chance at Tora Bora in November, 2001, would this horrific attack have occurred?",

   "September 11, 2005\n Lost at Tora Bora\n By MARY ANNE WEAVER\n Well past midnight one morning in early December 2001, according to American intelligence officials, Osama bin Laden sat with a group of top aides - including members of his elite international 055 Brigade - in the mountainous redoubt of Tora Bora in eastern Afghanistan. Outside, it was blustery and bitterly cold; many of the passes of the White Mountains, of which Tora Bora forms a part, were already blocked by snow. But inside the cave complex, where bin Laden had sought his final refuge from the American war in Afghanistan - a war in which Washington, that October, had struck back for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks - bin Laden munched on olives and sipped sugary mint tea. He was dressed in his signature camouflage jacket, and a Kalashnikov rested by his side. Captured Qaeda fighters, interviewed separately, told American interrogators that they recalled an address that bin Laden had made to his followers shortly before dawn. It concerned \n martyrdom. American bombs, including a 15,000-pound \"daisy cutter,\" were raining from the sky and pulverizing a number of the Tora Bora caves. And yet, one American intelligence official told me recently, if any one thing distinguished Osama bin Laden on that cold December day, it was the fact that the 44-year-old Saudi multimillionaire appeared to be supremely confident.\n \n ..... Defending its decision not to commit forces to the Tora Bora campaign, members of the Bush administration - including the president, the vice president and Gen. Tommy Franks - have continued to insist, as recently as the last presidential campaign, that there was no definitive information that bin Laden was even in Tora Bora in December 2001. \"We don't know to this day whether Mr. bin Laden was at Tora Bora,\" Franks wrote in an Oct. 19, 2004, Op-Ed article in The New York Times. Intelligence assessments on the Qaeda leader's location varied, Franks continued, and bin Laden was \"never within our grasp.\" It was not until this spring that the Pentagon, after a Freedom of Information Act request, released a document to The Associated Press that says Pentagon investigators believed that bin Laden was at Tora Bora and that he escaped.\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/magazine/11TORABORA.html\n \n As an American who never voted for George W. Bush, I offer my deep apologies to the nation of India for this despicable act which has been visited upon them, and I sorrow at my president's, George W. Bush's, possible complicity in this horrendous act.",

   "It has never been satisfactorily explained to me why members of the bin Laden family and members of the Saudi royal family were mysteriously whisked out of the United States within a day or two of the September 11, 2001 attack on my nation, while respectable, law-abiding American citizens were forbidden to leave the ground.\n \nAmericans who want to understand an important aspect of what has gone wrong with the Bush \"war on terrorism\" must read Craig Unger's stunning investigative story in the October issue of Vanity Fair. He provides a definitive account of how members of the bin Laden family and relatives of the House of Saud were spirited out of the country on private aircraft during the days following the Sept. 11 attacks -- when almost all aviation was prohibited.\n \n Boarding a series of flights that crisscrossed the country, from Florida to Kentucky to Los Angeles, Washington and Boston, they were permitted to leave on orders from the \"highest level\" of the United States government -- without any real interrogation or investigation by the FBI. As Unger points out, at least two bin Laden male kinsmen had been probed for connections with the U.S. branch of the World Association of Muslim Youth, a suspected terrorist front group.\n \n Why were individuals connected with the prime suspect in the worst crime in American history allowed to leave the country so abruptly? Unger examines the role of Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the suave Saudi ambassador and longtime crony of the Bush family, who apparently used his influence to win the release of as many as 140 of his compatriots, including the bin Ladens. \n\n Joe Conason's Journal - Salon.com",

We have seen time and time again that killing leaders in the terrorist heirarchy simply makes a vacancy at the top that is quickly filled by the next in line. Believe it or not, Al Qaeda and other similar terrorist groups are highly organized and resilient. It's not even clear right now if Al Qaeda is responsible for these attacks...kinda putting your cart before the horse aren't you?

The movie demonstrated that the Clinton Administration did not have the will to pull the trigger on Osama bin Laden.

He says there were 10 such chances between May 1998 and May 1999. It was not clear who decided not to take those chances.\n \n In May of 1998, after months of planning, officials called off a CIA plan to have Afghan allies capture bin Laden and send him out of Afghanistan for trial. The plan was apparently scrapped because of worries about the chance of killing bystanders, and even bin Laden himself, as well as concerns over the strength of the legal evidence against bin Laden. (CIA Insider Says Osama Hunt Flawed, Claims HQ Unit Has Fewer Officers Now Than On Sept. 11, 2001 - CBS News)\n CIA field agent Gary Bernsten told ABC News that the \"CIA provided an American president, first Bill Clinton, multiple opportunities to capture or kill bin Laden,\" Bernsten said. \"We provided those opportunities, tactical opportunities which were not taken.\" Bernsten said that CIA Director George Tenet gave the word to stop three opportunities to kill bin Laden. (ABC News The Blotter, September 10, 2006)\n \n Clinton National Security Advisor Sandy Berger also refused to authorize several strikes against bin Laden according to documents released by the 9/11 Commission. A document dated December 4, 1999, the National Security Council's counterterrorism coordinator, Richard Clarke, sent Mr. Berger a memo suggesting a strike in the last week of 1999 against Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. Reports the commission: \"In the margin next to Clarke's suggestion to attack Al Qaeda facilities in the week before January 1, 2000, Berger wrote, 'no.' \" (NY Sun July 23, 2004)\n \n So was it President Clinton who refused to authorize Tenet, Clarke and Berger to give the go ahead to nix bin Laden? Dick Morris, Clinton's chief political strategist, said that there were at least three times that Clinton refused to give that authorization that he knows of. The military officer who carries the nuclear football (who also carries the presidential mobile phone), Lt. Col. Buzz Patterson, who wrote a book about this very subject titled Dereliction of Duty, said in television interviews that \"in December 1996 with bombers and fighters in the air, Berger called the President through me and the president, knowing what the call was about, refused to take Berger's call.

In the second hour Clinton decided to debate the issue with Berger, Madeline Albright and Secretary Cohen. ... I saw this situation happen over and over and over again. The president didn't like making decisions like that,\" says Patterson.\n \n According to former Democratic fund raiser Mansoor Ijaz:\n From 1996 to 1998, I opened unofficial channels between Sudan and the Clinton administration. I met with officials in both countries, including Clinton, U.S. National Security Advisor Samuel R. \"Sandy\" Berger and Sudan's president and intelligence chief. President Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir offered the arrest and extradition of Bin Laden and detailed intelligence data about the global networks constructed by Egypt's Islamic Jihad, Iran's Hezbollah and the Palestinian Hamas. Among those in the networks were the two hijackers who piloted commercial airliners into the World Trade Center. The silence of the Clinton administration in responding to these offers was deafening. As an American Muslim and a political supporter of Clinton, I feel now, as I argued with Clinton and Berger then, that their counter-terrorism policies fueled the rise of Bin Laden from an ordinary man to a Hydra-like monster.

Not on this mattress. Serta & other top brands!\n clintonmattress.com\n \n \n The last issue of the Vision featured a column by this writer that told how the Democratic Leadership in the Senate threatened the broadcast license of ABC if it showed the mini-series The Path to 9/11. The movie demonstrated that the Clinton Administration did not have the will to pull the trigger on Osama bin Laden. The administration was also reluctant because they did not believe that they could make a rock solid criminal case against Osama. The Democratic leadership and Bill Clinton himself, vehemently deny this in spite of the evidence released in the 9/11 Commission Report. \n \n Should we all be proud that not a single one of the liberal to leftist professors and students I talked to about this threat to ABC denounced the behavior of those senators in the name of free speech, instead what I got was an attempt to justify government censorship with a defense of \"but Chuck, the movie isn't true.\"\n \n I hate to break the news to you hyper-partisans, it is true and a cadre of administration and CIA insiders say so, and you are about to see the proof. \n \n Michael Scheuer, the CIA agent in charge of hunting bin Laden in Afghanistan told CBS News:\n The CIA had more opportunities to capture or kill bin Laden that has been reported previously. He says there were 10 such chances between May 1998 and May 1999. It was not clear who decided not to take those chances.\n \n In May of 1998, after months of planning, officials called off a CIA plan to have Afghan allies capture bin Laden and send him out of Afghanistan for trial. The plan was apparently scrapped because of worries about the chance of killing bystanders, and even bin Laden himself, as well as concerns over the strength of the legal evidence against bin Laden. (CIA Insider Says Osama Hunt Flawed, Claims HQ Unit Has Fewer Officers Now Than On Sept. 11, 2001 - CBS News)\n CIA field agent Gary Bernsten told ABC News that the \"CIA provided an American president, first Bill Clinton, multiple opportunities to capture or kill bin Laden,\" Bernsten said. \"We provided those opportunities, tactical opportunities which were not taken.\" Bernsten said that CIA Director George Tenet gave the word to stop three opportunities to kill bin Laden. (ABC News The Blotter, September 10, 2006)\n \n Clinton National Security Advisor Sandy Berger also refused to authorize several strikes against bin Laden according to documents released by the 9/11 Commission. A document dated December 4, 1999, the National Security Council's counterterrorism coordinator, Richard Clarke, sent Mr. Berger a memo suggesting a strike in the last week of 1999 against Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. Reports the commission: \"In the margin next to Clarke's suggestion to attack Al Qaeda facilities in the week before January 1, 2000, Berger wrote, 'no.' \" (NY Sun July 23, 2004)\n \n So was it President Clinton who refused to authorize Tenet, Clarke and Berger to give the go ahead to nix bin Laden? Dick Morris, Clinton's chief political strategist, said that there were at least three times that Clinton refused to give that authorization that he knows of. The military officer who carries the nuclear football (who also carries the presidential mobile phone), Lt. Col. Buzz Patterson, who wrote a book about this very subject titled Dereliction of Duty, said in television interviews that \"in December 1996 with bombers and fighters in the air, Berger called the President through me and the president, knowing what the call was about, refused to take Berger's call. Berger was getting angry at me because I couldn't get an answer out of the president.\"\n \n Patterson spoke of another time in 1998 \"a cruise missile strike was planned against bin Laden and we had a two hour window. Berger was in the situation room, in the first hour after Berger called the president, Clinton refused to talk to him or return his call. In the second hour Clinton decided to debate the issue with Berger, Madeline Albright and Secretary Cohen. ... I saw this situation happen over and over and over again. The president didn't like making decisions like that,\" says Patterson.\n \n According to former Democratic fund raiser Mansoor Ijaz:\n From 1996 to 1998, I opened unofficial channels between Sudan and the Clinton administration. I met with officials in both countries, including Clinton, U.S. National Security Advisor Samuel R. \"Sandy\" Berger and Sudan's president and intelligence chief. President Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir offered the arrest and extradition of Bin Laden and detailed intelligence data about the global networks constructed by Egypt's Islamic Jihad, Iran's Hezbollah and the Palestinian Hamas. Among those in the networks were the two hijackers who piloted commercial airliners into the World Trade Center. The silence of the Clinton administration in responding to these offers was deafening. As an American Muslim and a political supporter of Clinton, I feel now, as I argued with Clinton and Berger then, that their counter-terrorism policies fueled the rise of Bin Laden from an ordinary man to a Hydra-like monster. (LA Times December 5 2001)\n Former FBI Director Louis Freeh said in his book, \"My FBI\", and in multiple interviews, that after the Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, Clinton refused to ask Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah to allow the FBI to interrogate bombing suspects the Saudi's had in custody. Freeh writes, \"Bill Clinton raised the subject only to tell the crown prince that he understood the Saudis' reluctance to cooperate and then he hit Abdullah up for a contribution to the Clinton Presidential Library.\" Says Freeh, \"That's a fact that I am reporting.\"\n \n Chuck Norton\n News Analyst\n Clinton Administration Turned Down 10 Chances to Get Osama The IUSB Vision Weblog\n\n \n \nWhy am I not surprised that you don't see the need in setting the record straight as to what administration is truly culpable for giving Bin Laden a pass that not only allowed this recent attack from taking place, but our own 9/11 from occurring. Only in your blindness and warped mind could you interpret my post as evidence of not caring about the victims of Munbai's terrorist attack.\n \n Yet you have no criticism for simone basing this thread on historical distortions and absolute lies. You looney lefty's love to fein compassion for victims of such travesties as you condemn the one President who has actually stood up to these terrorists. Your hypocrisy and inability to tell the truth is both telling, regarding your true character, and disturbing regarding your historical honesty as it reflects how distorted your world view is. emoticon_xdonno\n\n \n \nThis isn't any type of ploy at all simone. It's a direct refutation of your blatant lies that blame Bush for failing to find a guy that's buried alive in some invisible cave while Bill Clinton failed to take him out when he was living openly and totally exposed, when Clinton knew he was behind the 93 WTC attack, not to mention numerous others around the world. That is what I'm responding to. And it isn't me making these claims, but officials from the CIA and the Clinton Administration itself.\n Michael Scheuer, the CIA agent in charge of hunting bin Laden in Afghanistan told CBS News:\n The CIA had more opportunities to capture or kill bin Laden that has been reported previously.

But you must attempt to ignorantly blame our American president for the acts of an unknown terrorist group which is \"believed\" to be affiliated with Al-Qaeda. \n \n And with what evidence do you prove that if he was killed, and maybe is dead as we speak, (nobody knows for sure after all) that the principles upon which it exists would die with him, and the terrorist group would cease to exist? \n \n In other words this thread is based on complete ignorance and an irrational premise which only you would be small enough to use as a vehicle to attack bush with. If you really cared about the victims, you would blame the actual terrorists who killed them and the sadistic philosophy which drives them to commit the atrocities they carry out in pure evils name.\n",

I have no idea how much Pakistan is involved in all this either (I was just going by today's headlines...), but if it is linkable, I suspect that it will be in a bit of trouble.\n \n Personally, I'm going with Northern Ireland as a model solution again. Talk to the organisations that back up the extremists (if merely by non-interference), and you remove a lot of the bite - extremists have their own world views with varying amounts of warped, but without financial backing or organisational prowess they are reduced to the level of the soapbox and minor attacks - still a bad thing, to be sure, but a far better thing than large-scale assaults such as this.\n \n Negotiate with the countries that can reduce the extremism, reduce the sabre-rattling (nothing but recruitment for terrorism), and I suspect that we could go a fair way to reducing the violence.",

These tribal areas are loaded with people who are almost fanatical in support of their local tribal leaders and clerics. Many believe that Bin Laden has been hiding among these tribes between Pakistan and Afghanistan where he has a great deal of support, and where tribal leaders and clerics have villified the US, Israel, and anyone who is associated with them. \n \n In order to deal with problems ;ike this effectively, Pakistan needs to wrest control of this area, which would most likely mean an armed conflict of sectarian violebnce within Pakistan much like we have seen in Iraq.

There is no other option which they are allowing for.\n \"Islamist\" is a technical term used to refer to fundamentalist Muslims with a specific ideology and political agenda, in order to differentiate them from the vast majority of moderate and peace-loving Muslims who do not share their religious or political views.\n \n The Islamist agenda includes:\n \n imposing their interpretation of Islamic law on all members of society, like the Taliban in Afghanistan;\n .\n transforming Islam from a personal faith into a totalitarian political system;\n .\n overthrowing Muslim governments that cooperate with the West, and\n .\n establishing a pan-Islamic caliphate, stretching from Morocco to Indonesia and the Philippines... \n .\n all in service of their ultimate goal, which is to bring the entire world under the sway of radical Islam.Libforall Foundation - Radical Islam - The Islamist Agenda\n \n T Our difficulty lies in learning how to capture or kill the radicals while not hurting the innocents whom they hide amongst dressed as civilians. The fact is, when fighting such an enemy which plays on our valuing of human life, they have all of the advantages as they willfully kill indiscriminately while we attempt to preserve life at all cost. I obviously have no answer to this dilemma, and neither does anyone else on our side.",

   "That's the rub. There are always going to be people who justified or not will hate America, Israel, the jews, christians, and any who identify as our allies. So in that respect, there are always going to be people who want to kill us. Giving in to terrorist demands and attempting to appease them is not going to change it. Killing them all is not possible. Killing the ones we can kill is simply going to make more of them want to kill us. Therefore, we will firm our resolve to kill more of them...and so on and so forth. It is a perpetual cycle that will carry on for many years, probably long after we are all dead. \n \n Our goal needs to be one of minimization, not eradication. Sadly, world peace and harmony are untenable goals.\nI agree the problem will be ongoing...as long as there are masses of people on both sides of the issue. \n \n This is not the first time radical Islam has threatened to world. The Crusades beat them down more than once.\n \n In this modern day they have a totally new bag of weapons to use where previously the sword was their mainstay. Now they can kill thousands at a time with minimal losses of their own. The kill ratio is quite skewed. This should be patently obvious to us. They use up 19 of their faithful followers to kill 3000 other people (some of those were Muslim, but the radicals evidently do not care), the recent attacks in India required only 10 men to kill almost 200 people.\n \n What is a bit encouraging from Mumbai is the story I heard recently that some of the moderate Muslims in India are refusing to bury the bodies of the terrorists. I think the moderate Muslims are expressing their disdain for the radicals and their violence.",

Read and learn winny. Israeli Economy Weathers Global Storm Here's an excerpt:\n The global economy may be shaky, but Israelis don't seem to be tightening their belts. Consider car sales, long an indicator of how an economy is faring. Israeli auto importers have been enjoying an unprecedented boom, with 81,500 cars sold in the first four months of this year, up 61% even from the record pace set last year. To meet demand, the local Toyota (TM) importer asked for an increased allocation from Japan, and Toyota agreed to lift shipments by 12%. But that still leaves Israeli car-buyers with a considerable wait for popular Corolla and Prius models.\n \n It used to be that when the U.S. economy sneezed, Israel caught a bad cold. These days, the Middle East nation's economy is proving far more resilient than in the past. \"Israel will be one of the countries that is least affected by the global economic crisis,\" predicts Leo Leiderman, chief economist at Bank Hapoalim (POLI.TA), the country's largest bank.\n \n Booming exports, the absence of a local housing bubble, and robust consumer spending all have contributed to continued confidence. Israel's economy has grown by 5% or more for the past four years, and even with the clouds on the global horizon, economists are forecasting a healthy 4% growth rate in 2008.",

   "The Washington Times \n \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Politicized intelligence . . . \n By Mansoor Ijaz \n Published March 23, 2004 \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n LONDON. -- Richard Clarke, former White House counterterrorism czar for Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, testifies today before the commission investigating the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States. He is well-qualified to do so because few individuals over the last decade, inside or outside government, better understood the Islamic extremism threat in all its dimensions.\n \n But rather than deliver a factual recounting and analysis of intelligence failures and politically charged antiterrorism policies that plagued his years as coordinator for counterterrorism operations, he has chosen to characterize the Bush White House as indifferent to the threat posed by Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network prior to the September 11 attacks without consideration for the failures on his watch during the Clinton years. This is inaccurate and adds nothing to our understanding of how distant terrorists could plan and carry out such daring and effective attacks.\n \n Mr. Clarke's premise that Bush national security officials neither understood nor cared to know anything about al Qaeda is simply untrue. I know because on multiple occasions from June until late August 2001, I personally briefed Stephen J. Hadley, deputy national security adviser to President Bush, and members of his South Asia, Near East and East Africa staff at the National Security Council on precisely what had gone wrong during the Clinton years to unearth the extent of the dangers posed by al Qaeda. Some of the briefings were in the presence of former members of the Clinton administration's national security team to ensure complete transparency.\n \n Far from being disinterested, the Bush White House was eager to avoid making the same mistakes of the previous administration and wanted creative new inputs for how to combat al Qaeda's growing threat.\n \n Mr. Clarke's role figured in two key areas of the debriefings -- Sudan's offer to share terrorism data on al Qaeda and bin Laden in 1997, and a serious effort by senior members of the Abu Dhabi royal family to gain bin Laden's extradition from Afghanistan in early 2000.\n \n \u0095 Fall 1997: Sudan's offer is accepted by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, then rejected by Mr. Clarke and Clinton National Security Adviser Samuel \"Sandy\" Berger.\n \n Sudan's president, Omar Hasan El Bashir, made an unconditional offer of counterterrorism assistance to the vice chairman of the September 11 Commission, then Rep. Lee Hamilton, Indiana Democrat, through my hands on April 19, 1997. Five months later on Sept. 28, 1997, after an exhaustive interagency review at the entrenched bureaucracy level of the U.S. government, Mrs. Albright announced the U.S. would send a high-level diplomatic team back to Khartoum to pressure its Islamic government to stop harboring Arab terrorists and to review Sudan data on terrorist groups operating from there.\n \n As the re-engagement policy took shape, Susan E. Rice, incoming assistant secretary of state for East Africa, went to Mr. Clarke, made her anti-Sudan case and asked him to jointly approach Mr. Berger about the wisdom of Mrs. Albright's decision. Together, they recommended its reversal.The decision was overturned on Oct. 1, 1997.\n \n Without Mr. Clarke's consent, Mr. Berger is unlikely to have gone along with such an early confrontation with the first woman to hold the highest post at Foggy Bottom. \n \n \n U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed by al Qaeda 10 months later. Files with detailed data on three of the embassy bombers were among the casualties of Mr. Clarke's decision to recommend missile attacks on an empty Khartoum pharmaceutical plant rather than get Sudan's data out almost a year earlier to begin unraveling al Qaeda's network.\n \n To this day, neither Mr. Berger nor Mr. Clarke has explained to the American people why a deliberative decision of the U.S. government, made by interagency review, was overturned in such cavalier fashion by a small clique of Clinton advisers in the face of Sudan's unconditional April 1997 offer to cooperate on terrorism issues. If he was interested in facts, why did Mr. Clarke spurn the recommendations of his own intelligence and foreign policy institutions that the Sudanese offer be explored? Why did he not act on the Sudanese intelligence chief's direct approach to the FBI, of which he was aware, in early 1998 just prior to the final planning stages of the embassy bombings?\n \n \u0095 Spring 2000: Abu Dhabi's offer to get bin Laden out of Afghanistan falls flat.\n In late 1999, after a barrage of threats from al Qaeda's senior leadership against the Abu Dhabi royal family, a senior family member approached the Taliban foreign minister and Mullah Omar to discuss mechanisms for getting bin Laden out of Afghanistan. Mr. Clarke, who enjoyed close relations with the Abu Dhabi family, was brought into the loop early to prevent separation between Washington and Abu Dhabi on such a sensitive matter.\n \n While Mr. Clarke was skeptical of the idea at first, he played ball long enough to understand the real intentions of the Taliban regime. Smart enough, except when the deal got real.\n \n As the strategy started taking shape in earnest -- a personal request from President Clinton to Sheikh Zayed, Abu Dhabi's ruler, seeking help to get bin Laden coupled with a $5 billion pan-Arab Afghan Development Fund that would be offered in return for bin Laden taking residence under house arrest in Abu Dhabi, with the possibility of extraditing him later to the United States -- Mr. Clarke again scuttled the deal by opting instead for the militaristic solution. He pushed for armed CIA predator drones to hunt bin Laden in the remote mountains of northeastern Afghanistan.\n \n Abu Dhabi was left with a black eye. The Taliban became even more aggressive in allowing al Qaeda to plan and carry out terrorist operations from Afghan soil. Another chance to capture the world's most notorious terrorist had been lost.\n \n Mr. Clarke's selective memory serves no interest but his own agenda. He personifies the politicizing of intelligence by pointing fingers during the political high season for failures that not only occurred on his watch but also were due partly to his grand vision he would one day personally authorize a drone operation to kill bin Laden.\n \n Mr. Clarke, as he testifies today, should remember he served at the pleasure of the American people. He was appointed to defend us against the very terrorists he repeatedly assessed inaccurately. A grateful nation recognizes the difficulty of his task but we ask that he stick to facts rather than inject vitriol and untruths into a debate that must yield answers to help protect our children in the future.",

   "March 23, 2004, 8:55 a.m.\n A Dick Clarke Top Seven\n Questions for commissioners.\n \n by Mansoor Ijaz\n \n \n Richard Clarke, the former White House counterterrorism czar in four successive administrations, testifies in front of the 9/11 Commission on Wednesday. But what should have been a serious inquiry into how a loosely knit gang of Islamic fanatics could rise to become one of history's most lethal and effective global terrorist organizations now promises to become a political spectacle.\n \n At the height of the presidential campaign season, Clarke has made irresponsible and untrue allegations that the Bush White House was indifferent to the threat posed by al Qaeda in the months leading up to the 9/11 attacks. Whether his charges are the result of a momentary lapse in judgment in an otherwise distinguished civil-service career, or the hallmark of personal ego and greed in trying to sell a book while settling scores with a Bush White House that demoted him, the 9/11 commissioners cannot be deterred in their task to find out the truth about what happened on his watch to America's counterterrorism efforts. \n \n The 9/11 commissioners have a thankless job of asking tough questions that nobody wants to ask. There will be a broad set of questions asked Tuesday and Wednesday of the various witnesses who appear. But when Clarke goes under oath, there will be a need to get down to specifics because the devil of understanding how 9/11 became possible is in the details of what Clarke did or did not do.\n \n If I were a 9/11 commissioner, there are seven very pointed areas of inquiry I would enter into with Clarke to understand exactly how the intelligence failures and policy missteps evolved:\n \n 1. Sudan's offer to hand over Osama bin Laden. Mr. Clarke, we know from news reports and the testimony of a former U.S. ambassador that a meeting took place at an Alexandria, Virginia, hotel in February 1996 between Sudan's minister of defense, El Fatih Erwa, Ambassador Timothy Carney, a career State Department officer, and a CIA official with oversight responsibility for African affairs. During that meeting, Erwa offered to have Osama bin Laden extradited to Saudi Arabia (an offer which President Clinton has admitted to and also said that the Saudi government declined when asked), and barring that, to have Sudan essentially baby-sit him with U.S. guidance (which we also turned down). Is it true that a second meeting took place a few weeks later in which Erwa and the CIA officer met alone? What can you tell us about that meeting? Did Erwa make an offer, however vague or oblique, to permit the United States to have access to bin Laden in a manner similar to the capture of Carlos the Jackal that Sudan orchestrated with France? If the CIA case officer received this offer, did he pass it up the chain of command and did you at the NSC see or review any notes of that meeting? If he did not, was this a result of the poor state of relations between CIA and the White House or just a bureaucratic snafu? How do you assess President Clinton's own view that the administration chose not to bring bin Laden to the United States because there were insufficient legal grounds for doing so? Why would he make such a claim if there were never any offer in the first place?\n \n 2. Sudan's counterterrorism offer. Mr. Clarke, in April 1997, a private U.S. citizen brought an unconditional offer from Sudan's president to cooperate on the intelligence data about various terrorist groups, including al Qaeda, to the vice chairman of this commission, the Honorable Lee Hamilton. On September 28, 1997, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced after a five-month interagency review that the U.S. was sending a high-level team of diplomats back to Sudan to pressure the Islamist government there to stop harboring terrorists, and to have a look at Sudan's intelligence files on those terrorists it had harbored in previous years, including several of the 9/11 hijackers and several of the planners for the 1998 U.S.-embassy bombings. That decision was overturned on October 1, 1997. What role did you play in the reversal of that decision? Were you ever approached by Susan E. Rice, the former director of African affairs at the National Security Council and assistant secretary of state for East Africa, to assist her in making a case to Samuel R. \"Sandy\" Berger in overturning the Albright decision? If so, what were her reasons, and why did you agree with her assessment, if you did? Please tell us whether any officials other than you, Mr. Berger, and Ms. Rice were involved in that decision.\n \n 3. Iraq and al Qaeda the Sudan connection. Mr. Clarke, are you aware of a February 1998 correspondence from Sudan's intelligence chief to FBI Regional Director for East Africa David Williams in which again an offer to share terrorism data was made by Sudan without conditions? Are you aware that bin Laden's chief deputy in Sudan made a trip to Baghdad to visit with Iraqi intelligence officials at about the same time in February 1998? If not, why not? How do you reconcile your categorical statement in a recent 60 Minutes interview that there was no relationship between al Qaeda and Iraq ever, I believe is how you put it with the fact that bin Laden's chief deputy was visiting Baghdad at the same time you were receiving repeated offers to explore Sudan's intelligence files?\n \n 4. The U.S. embassy bombings. Mr. Clarke, once the U.S. embassies had been attacked in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998, Sudan's intelligence chief again contacted the FBI in a handwritten note that has been published, and offered to turn over to U.S. custody two of the key suspects who had taken up residence in an apartment overlooking the U.S. embassy in Khartoum. Why did the United States not pursue their extradition immediately? Were you aware of the offer? If not, why not? If so, why did you not, in your role as counterterrorism coordinator, make sure the FBI was given all support necessary from the White House to gain their extradition?\n \n 5. Retaliation: bombing the al-Shifa plant in Khartoum. Mr. Clarke, you then recommended bombing Sudan's al-Shifa pharmaceutical plant as the best response to the embassy attacks. Can you recount the evidence that led you to believe al-Shifa was producing nerve agents, and the evidence you had of its ownership and financing by bin Laden? Can you again help us to rectify your categorical statement now that there was no relationship between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's regime, ever, when you previously argued that Iraq and Sudan were cooperating on the development of chemical and biological weapons at a pharmaceutical plant you claimed was owned and financed by bin Laden? \n \n 6. The United Arab Emirates offers help on capturing bin Laden. Mr. Clarke, press reports indicate that the government of the United Arab Emirates, for its own reasons, was interested in helping the United States get bin Laden out of Afghanistan during the summer of 2000. It is our understanding that you were involved in a similar effort already in late 1999 and that the effort failed for a number of different reasons before a second attempt was made to revive it. First, can you tell us precisely what is the nature of your relationship with the UAE ruling family? Are you aware of any threats that were made against the family by al Qaeda leaders during that period of time? Did you relay any U.S. intelligence on the nature of those threats to UAE officials at that time? Did any UAE official, including members of the ruling family responsible for defense and national-security affairs, make an assessment or an offer to find a way to get bin Laden out of Afghanistan? If so, did it involve the construction of an Afghan Development Fund for the Taliban regime in return for bin Laden's transfer to the UAE? Was onward extradition of bin Laden from the UAE to the United States ever discussed with you? Did you ever make the president aware that such a possibility to get bin Laden out of Afghanistan existed? Was it your view at that time that armed CIA predator drones, which would presumably identify and kill senior al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan, were the most efficient tools available to the United States for dealing with the threat posed by al Qaeda?\n \n 7. Did al Qaeda get nuclear assistance from Pakistan? A Pakistani national, Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, has now admitted to selling nuclear hardware and other materials for the construction of nuclear devices to Iran, Libya, and North Korea. The White House in which you worked was warned about Pakistan's nuclear black-market enterprise in August of 2000, and again in September 2000. You clearly had suspicions about the North Korean relationship very early on. Other troubling aspects of Pakistan's nuclear program were brought to Mr. Berger's attention as early as February 1996. Can you tell us today whether al Qaeda was able to get its hands on sufficient nuclear materials to be able to build a radiological device? Do you believe al Qaeda possesses a functional nuclear device? Did the Clinton administration have sufficient evidence to confront Pakistan's military regime about the illicit nuclear activities of its scientists? Why did you not act on the intelligence you had to stop Dr. Khan's network earlier?\n \n Factual answers to these questions, minus the political bluster and ad-hominem attacks aimed at scoring points with a potential future employer, would go a long way in restoring Richard Clarke's severely damaged credibility as an observer and participant in some of history's most important events. Our future generations deserve better than to watch catfights between grown adults charged with nothing less than providing for their safety and security.\n \n Just tell us the truth, Mr. Clarke.\n \n Mansoor Ijaz is chairman of Crescent Investment Management in New York. He negotiated Sudan's offer of counterterrorism assistance on al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden to the Clinton administration in 1997 and coauthored the blueprint for the ceasefire in Kashmir in the summer of 2000.",

Brought to you by yours truly. emoticon_xgood\n \n Clinton Administration Turned Down 10 Chances to Get Osama\n September 25, 2006 - iusbvision\n Ads by Google\n Clinton Mattress Retail\n Count sheep? Not on this mattress. Serta & other top brands!\n clintonmattress.com\n \n \n The last issue of the Vision featured a column by this writer that told how the Democratic Leadership in the Senate threatened the broadcast license of ABC if it showed the mini-series The Path to 9/11. The movie demonstrated that the Clinton Administration did not have the will to pull the trigger on Osama bin Laden. The administration was also reluctant because they did not believe that they could make a rock solid criminal case against Osama. The Democratic leadership and Bill Clinton himself, vehemently deny this in spite of the evidence released in the 9/11 Commission Report. \n \n Should we all be proud that not a single one of the liberal to leftist professors and students I talked to about this threat to ABC denounced the behavior of those senators in the name of free speech, instead what I got was an attempt to justify government censorship with a defense of \"but Chuck, the movie isn't true.\"\n \n I hate to break the news to you hyper-partisans, it is true and a cadre of administration and CIA insiders say so, and you are about to see the proof. \n \n Michael Scheuer, the CIA agent in charge of hunting bin Laden in Afghanistan told CBS News:\n The CIA had more opportunities to capture or kill bin Laden that has been reported previously. He says there were 10 such chances between May 1998 and May 1999. It was not clear who decided not to take those chances.\n \n In May of 1998, after months of planning, officials called off a CIA plan to have Afghan allies capture bin Laden and send him out of Afghanistan for trial. The plan was apparently scrapped because of worries about the chance of killing bystanders, and even bin Laden himself, as well as concerns over the strength of the legal evidence against bin Laden. (CIA Insider Says Osama Hunt Flawed, Claims HQ Unit Has Fewer Officers Now Than On Sept. 11, 2001 - CBS News)\n CIA field agent Gary Bernsten told ABC News that the \"CIA provided an American president, first Bill Clinton, multiple opportunities to capture or kill bin Laden,\" Bernsten said. \"We provided those opportunities, tactical opportunities which were not taken.\" Bernsten said that CIA Director George Tenet gave the word to stop three opportunities to kill bin Laden. (ABC News The Blotter, September 10, 2006)\n \n Clinton National Security Advisor Sandy Berger also refused to authorize several strikes against bin Laden according to documents released by the 9/11 Commission. A document dated December 4, 1999, the National Security Council's counterterrorism coordinator, Richard Clarke, sent Mr. Berger a memo suggesting a strike in the last week of 1999 against Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. Reports the commission: \"In the margin next to Clarke's suggestion to attack Al Qaeda facilities in the week before January 1, 2000, Berger wrote, 'no.' \" (NY Sun July 23, 2004)\n \n So was it President Clinton who refused to authorize Tenet, Clarke and Berger to give the go ahead to nix bin Laden? Dick Morris, Clinton's chief political strategist, said that there were at least three times that Clinton refused to give that authorization that he knows of. The military officer who carries the nuclear football (who also carries the presidential mobile phone), Lt. Col. Buzz Patterson, who wrote a book about this very subject titled Dereliction of Duty, said in television interviews that \"in December 1996 with bombers and fighters in the air, Berger called the President through me and the president, knowing what the call was about, refused to take Berger's call. Berger was getting angry at me because I couldn't get an answer out of the president.\"\n \n Patterson spoke of another time in 1998 \"a cruise missile strike was planned against bin Laden and we had a two hour window. Berger was in the situation room, in the first hour after Berger called the president, Clinton refused to talk to him or return his call. In the second hour Clinton decided to debate the issue with Berger, Madeline Albright and Secretary Cohen. ... I saw this situation happen over and over and over again. The president didn't like making decisions like that,\" says Patterson.\n \n According to former Democratic fund raiser Mansoor Ijaz:\n From 1996 to 1998, I opened unofficial channels between Sudan and the Clinton administration. I met with officials in both countries, including Clinton, U.S. National Security Advisor Samuel R. \"Sandy\" Berger and Sudan's president and intelligence chief. President Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir offered the arrest and extradition of Bin Laden and detailed intelligence data about the global networks constructed by Egypt's Islamic Jihad, Iran's Hezbollah and the Palestinian Hamas. Among those in the networks were the two hijackers who piloted commercial airliners into the World Trade Center. The silence of the Clinton administration in responding to these offers was deafening. As an American Muslim and a political supporter of Clinton, I feel now, as I argued with Clinton and Berger then, that their counter-terrorism policies fueled the rise of Bin Laden from an ordinary man to a Hydra-like monster. (LA Times December 5 2001)\n Former FBI Director Louis Freeh said in his book, \"My FBI\", and in multiple interviews, that after the Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, Clinton refused to ask Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah to allow the FBI to interrogate bombing suspects the Saudi's had in custody. Freeh writes, \"Bill Clinton raised the subject only to tell the crown prince that he understood the Saudis' reluctance to cooperate and then he hit Abdullah up for a contribution to the Clinton Presidential Library.\" Says Freeh, \"That's a fact that I am reporting.\"\n \n Chuck Norton\n News Analyst \n Clinton Administration Turned Down 10 Chances to Get Osama The IUSB Vision Weblog\n",

   "If you guys want to go back to partisan fighting that is fine, but I have a pet pieve where Richard Clarke is concerned. Clarke tried to snow the 911 Commission and got caught. The tape of him talking to reporters saying exactly the opposite what his book says and what his testimony was was bad enough, the rest of the evidence just confirms what the tape already suggested. \n \n Clarke wanted to cash in on partisan vigor during the 9/11 Hearings and the upcoming election with his book and in the process did a disservice to his country.\n\n \n You hit the nail right on the head Historian. Unfortunately, and you will learn this soon enough; we have many partisans who prefer rewritten history to factual history since the former fits with their world view where as the latter usually reveals the flaws in that very world view.

It goes all the way back to \"The Sophists\" of ancient Greece. Aristotle considered their tactics to be \"unethical rhetoric\".",
