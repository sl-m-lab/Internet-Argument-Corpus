   "A New Game For Terrorist Kids...\n \n \n While the images are not as gruesome as the recent beheading videos of Kim Sun Il and Nick Berg they are nonetheless just as disturbing. That's because the participants in this video are young children who are staging a mock execution reminiscent of the Kim and Berg decapitations. \n \n The New York Daily News said the \"game\" could be called \"behead the infidel.\"\n \n The shocking images in this movie take the words \"silent movies\" to an entirely different level. (Click here to see the video.)\n \n A girl and two hooded boys stand over a kneeling boy - all in positions to the ones similar to the ones assumed by the captors in recent executions. While gesticulating furiously with his hand, the hooded leader appears to deliver a speech. His apparent diatribe ends and the three captors, all carrying play stick rifles, seize their helpless victim.\n \n The ringleader and the girl then pretend to saw off their victim's head. \n \n The New York Daily News reported that the video was found by them on the web site, shareeah.org, of radical hook-handed London based Islamic preacher Sheik Abu Hamza al-Masri, jailed last month on terror charges. \n \n However, an exhaustive search by a reporter on Thursday failed to find the video on al-Masri's web site. It was, however, obtained elsewhere and is available here.\n \n The web site, shareeah.org, is apparently run by members of Hamza's Finsbury Park Mosque in London, formerly attended by Zacarias Moussaoui and shoe-bomber Richard Reid. It appears to be administrated out of Utrecht in the Netherlands.\n \n A spokesman did not immediately respond to an e-mail or a message left on voice-mail. \n \n Al-Masri was taken into custody in a predawn raid in London in May on a U.S. warrant, accused of trying to set up jihad camps in Oregon and helping the bombers of the U.S. destroyer Cole. \n \n As CNN pointed out earlier this year, al-Masri is one of the most controversial Muslim figures in Britain. Although he was banned from his Finsbury Park mosque in London's northern suburbs in 2003, he nonetheless continued to preach on the pavement outside.\n \n Police said, CNN reported, that the Finsbury Park mosque premises \"have played a role in the recruitment of suspected terrorists and in supporting their activity both here and abroad.\" \n \n Al-Masri came to prominence in 1999 when five Britons of Pakistani origin were convicted in Yemen, CNN reported. They were sentenced to between three and seven years for plotting to blow up targets in Aden including the British consulate, a church and a hotel.\n \n His teenage son and stepson were among those convicted and prosecutors said he had sent the group to Yemen. Al-Masri denied this, CNN said, and the five insisted they had been tortured into signing confessions.\n \n Al-Masri and his group were also accused of working with Islamic radicals who kidnaped 16 Westerners in December 1998. Four of the Westerners died in a shoot-out during a botched rescue attempt by Yemeni security forces.\n \n After the attacks of 9/11, Al-Masri said the plane hijackers should be hailed as \"martyrs\" if it emerged they had carried out the attacks in the name of Islam. \n \n CNN reported Al-Masri said, \"I won't condone what has happened and I won't condemn it because I don't know who has done it yet. If somebody has done this just for earthly gain and political advancement, then obviously it is a cheap cause. But if it was done because people are desperate and their lives have been threatened, then that is a respectable cause which no one could dare to condemn. Then those people who carried out the attacks would be martyrs. Martyrdom is the highest form of jihad (holy war). \n \n Abu Hamza married a British woman and became a British citizen in 1981.\n \n By: Jeremy Reynalds\n http://www.mensnewsdaily.com/archive/r/rey...nalds062504.htm\n \n What do you think? emoticon_wow",
