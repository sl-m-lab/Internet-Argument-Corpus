There was no one there at the door interviewing people, saying \"you can't come in if you're gay.\" There was no sign that said \"no gays allowed.\" This was a perfect opportunity for gay families to bring their kids and participate, in equality, like all the other families there. You HAD that available. But you wanted MORE than equal representation there--you wanted to stand out from the crowd and make a big issue out of something that wasn't an issue with this event at all. \n Thats' the problem.\n\n That's a problem for you.\n It's a problem for others.\n \n You want to make us \"stand out from the crowd\" on YOUR terms, and insist that we \"fit in\" when you want us to. When it's convenient for you.\n Sorry, but no...\n \n Tell me Jyoshu. If this had been a group of Southern Baptists who all decided to wear matching t-shirts, would you be complaining this vehemently?",

   "As a general note, I just can't help but comment on a general impression regarding some perceived opinions...\n \n I feel like some people say that they want the equality omelet, but they don't want to see any eggs cracked or feathers ruffled. I feel like some people want the equality omelet off the menu, and are using complaints of cracked eggs and ruffled feathers as an excuse to ensure that omelets aren't an option.\n \n With that said, I acknowledge that it's possible to go too far. There is no point in breaking all the eggs by throwing them at the floor as hard as you can.\n But I don't see that being done by the mainstream gay movement. I don't see anybody's opinions being changed from pro-gay or gay-neutral to anti-gay just because they see some gays wearing matching clothing.\n And if there are people like that out there, then I would love to meet them to try and figure out how they can go from observing a handful of gay people doing something relatively immaterial, to supporting prejudice against AN ENTIRE GROUP of gay people. \n Just think. An opinion judging over 14 MILLION people, based on the actions of about a dozen. Now THAT is efficiency! <end sarcasm<\n \n If a person makes it known that he is a homosexual, that's his freedom of speech. Just like another person can state that they are Jewish, or that they are black.\n It's not a political statement. It's not a protest. It's an acknowledgement of fact.\n \n What some people fail to acknowledge is that hiding in the closet has done ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for the gay rights movement. In fact, it ensured that laws which were on the books for centuries went unchallenged.\n Silence has gotten the gay rights movement nowhere.\n And for those who believe that not being quieter has set gay rights back, I challenge them to show me precisely how that is the case...\n Don't just explain the opinion. Prove it...\n \n Gay men and women had to speak out and challenge the conception that homosexuality was a mental illness, and get people to question the assumption. They didn't do that by blending in, but rather by making it known that they lived an ordinary life like heterosexuals, but that they weren't heterosexuals.\n We could go through a list of other issues, starting with the legal environment around the \"Stonewall\" period, but I don't see a point. I think that some just don't want to know...\n \n Silence allows people to assume that gays are just like they have always been told. Like the stereo-types.\n Polls have shown that people opposed to gay rights are less likely to actually know anybody who is gay. Experience has shown me that those opposed to gay rights are more likely to have no clue as to who gay people truly are. Experience has also shown me that those who try to tell me, a gay man, how they claim gays \"actually are\", despite me telling them otherwise, are just too damn stupid to be reasoned with. They'll never change their minds because they think they know gay people better than gays themselves...\n \n Most people when they hear of the \"Smith\" family, they think of a white, heterosexual couple. If you saw the Smith family on the street, you might realize that they aren't white, but rather black. If you saw the Smith family on the street, you might assume that it's a father and a friend walking their baby, and not a gay couple.\n \n Breaking through these assumptions to show the truth is not a political statement. It's not a \"protest\".\n It's an act as simple as a Christian man wearing a cross, or a Jewish man wearing a yarmulke.",

I thought that any behavior or even the mere mention of anything that would indicate to others that I am gay is \"flaunting it\" or \"pushing it down others' throats.\" \n \n \nFirst, \"gay pride\" (two sins).

Hmmm????\n \n \n \nPossibly. Depends on the context, who (if anyone) recruited them, the political climate, etc.\n\n Already addressed...\n The Ladies' Group recruited within their own membership to go.\n They have been involved in political issues in the past.\n \n Address the issue instead of dodging it and pretending that I am the one not addressing things...\n \n \n \nWell I've certainly come to realize that no argument you disagree with will ever \"convince\" you of anything.\n\n Incredibly not true.\n I mean seriously jyoshu. Take a step back and THINK about this situation for a minute.\n I am classifying this as not a political issue based on the DEFINITION of the word \"political\".\n You have concocted a variety of arbitrary wickets by which you, without any secondary corroborating source, have declared this as \"political\".\n \n Do you REALLY THINK that you have presented an argument here that would persuade ANYBODY to your cause?\n Seriously. Do you?\n \n \n \nI think you're just being beligerent here, because I just don't think you're so naive as to think this is like little old ladies, the cub scouts, or the cleaning janitors, or whatever other nonpolitical-as-possible examples you could come up with to avoid the possibility that there were political motives at work here.\n\n O-M-G you are just soooo avoiding the issue.\n You keep claiming that the boogeyman is in the closet, but when I open the closet and ask you to point to him, you keep insisting that he's there and ignore the fact that you're INCAPABLE of pointing to a boogey-man.\n \n WHAT political motive did they have?\n If you claim there is a political motive present, then EXPLAIN WHAT political motive it is.\n \n It's just that fricken' simple.\n \n \n \nYou seem to have this idea that as long as a message doesn't directly address the issue, context can be completely ignored is deciding that there's nothing polical about it, even when there's plenty to suggest it is You see, the very fact a gay activist organization organized this effort makes it questionable. I bet you'd be the first person to throw stones if a Christian Right organization recruited people to go to an event and make a statement by trying to stand out, wouldn't you?\n\n Jyoshu, YOU are the one demonstrating GROSS hypocrisy and bias here. Not me.\n I have pointed out REPEATEDLY that the anti-gay group was SPECIFICALLY MAKING an anti-gay protest AT THIS VERY EVENT, and there has been NO specific comment whatsoever from you to criticize the people who did this. None at all.\n \n But to answer your question, the answer is a resounding NO if the situation were analogous to what you described.\n If all they were doing was wearing a little Cross pin or necklace or whatever, and they were going about the event and all they did was WEAR THE CROSS, then I would have NO problem with them.\n \n If the gay families in question actually started talking to the other members present about gay family legislation, then that would be making it \"political\".\n If the Christian families in question actually started talking to the other members present about gay family legislation, then that would be making it \"political\".\n \n In fact, I'm curious as to WHAT I have actually said which leads you to the conclusion that you claim. My example is simple. Your refusal to criticize the other side of the fence for a more egregious violation of your standard.\n What lead you to your conclusion that made you think I might have a different standard for Christians?",

   "This last paragraph is the only thing I need to respond to--the rest of your post is mostly just quibbling terms and individual words. \n\n The hypocrisy and dishonesty beaming off of you is incredible.\n You accuse me of not addressing the issues at hand (and fail to show anywhere where I supposedly did that), and then you ignore the majority of my statements by doing nothing more than claiming it is \" quibbling terms and individual words\".\n YOU claim that it's a \"political statement\", and then whine when I point out that it is not a political statement?\n Truly pathetic!\n \n \n \nSince you've actually made a stance here, this is what I'll respond to. \n\n More dishonesty from Jyoshu. I've put forth \"stances\" left and right...\n \n \n \nThe bottom line is that you believe the message of \"gay people exist\" is not political. Fine, disagree with me if you want. I think it IS political, and it was making a statement (which you've now agreed to). It's political because of the context of the gay rights debate in this country, and because it was initiated by a gay rights group, and there is no indication these people would have gone otherwise. Obviously you are determined not to see it that way (since you're naturally going to give them the benefit of the doubt), so we're going to have to agree to disagree here. I see no point in continuing in a long drawn out quibbling discussion about what the definition of \"is\" is. I also think the whole idea of having a message \"gay people exist\" is strange, because everyone knows that gay people exist. Therefore this effort by this gay rights group was a waste of time if you ask me.\n\n Your refusal to admit the obvious is amazing. Or, in this case, your refusal to go from the undeniable to the obvious is amazing.\n \"Gays exist\" is a STATEMENT OF FACT. Undeniable, irrefutable fact.\n It is no more a \"political statement\" than saying \"blacks exist\" or \"Jews exist\" or \"Men exist\".\n Is there any controversy to the statement of fact that \"Gays exist\" or \"Gay families exist\"? No.\n \n But you see controversy about the SUBJECT of gay people, so therefore you automatically try to convey political aspects revolving around the issue onto simple statements of fact...\n \n The fact that you claim it was a \"political statement\", but then you see no point to it, is hilarious.\n The fact that you see no point to this \"political statement\", yet you object to its existence anyways, is INCREDIBLY telling of your lack of substance...\n \n \n Tell me. If one of the gay parents had gone without the clothing accessory, all on his/her own without advisement from anybody else, and had mentioned in conversation that he/she was gay, would that constitute a \"political statement\" to you?\n The truth of the matter is that YOU view this issue through eyes of controversy and politics, and therefore YOU automatically claim that is what is going on without even bothering to THINK about it first...\n \n \n \nYou're going to see what you want to see. IMO it showed the true bad colors of your movement in that it tried to use an Easter event as gay rights platform, even if it was merely to say gays exist.\n\n The statement was not political. Plain and simple.\n I've used simple definitions and simple facts to explain that stance.\n \n You, on the other hand, have concocted all sorts of arbitrary reasons to pretend a simple statement of fact was a \"political statement\".\n \n And in ALL of this, you have repeatedly refused to explicitly condemn the anti-gay people who WERE disruptive to the event, and who WERE protesting the event.\n You have revealed more about your prejudice in this exchange than you meant to, and it won't be forgotten.",
