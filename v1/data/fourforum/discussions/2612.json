   "Bush Addresses 'The Lobby'\n \n The most powerful lobby in Washington, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), has held its yearly conference, and a Jewish Telegraphic Agency report offers some insight into the level of corruption that it represents.\n \n Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Texas) introduced Bush by calling him the greatest friend of Israel the world has ever had, and received a standing ovation.\n \n The JTA reports: \"Bush is something of a messiah to those attending the conference in Washington. The very mention of his name or the sight of his image on video screens prompts thunderous rounds of applause and standing ovations.\"\n \n JTA: \"Don Shein disagrees with President Bush on the environment. He disagrees with Bush on stem-cell research. And he disagrees with Bush on abortion. But he's voting for Bush anyway. For Shein, a financial adviser from Baltimore, the election is about only one thing: Israel.\"\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=2894\n \n \n In Meeting, Kerry Emphasizes His Strong Support of Israel\n \n Senator John Kerry told dozens of Jewish leaders in New York on Sunday that he would continue the Bush administration policy of vetoing any United Nations Security Council resolutions seen as one-sided against Israel, participants in a closed 90-minute meeting said.\n \n [Thank goodness it was closed..who wants to see that much Jewish hiney getting kissed? By the way, when will Sen. Kerry be addressing a group of Palestinian leaders?]\n \n At the meeting, attended by the heads of major Jewish groups and Jewish politicians, he also repeated what he said in the televised debate earlier on Sunday: that the barrier Israel is erecting to separate Palestinian territories from Israeli ones is a fence, not a wall.\n \n [He's the perfect politician for them! Are they cloning the politicians in America these days?]\n \n Mr. Kerry noted that if elected he would be the first president with a Jewish heritage and a Jewish relative, people at the meeting said. His brother, Cameron, who also attended, converted to Judaism. His paternal grandparents were Jews who converted to Roman Catholicism in fleeing Europe. In Vienna yesterday, an Austrian genealogist said two Jewish relatives of Mr. Kerry's - his grandmother's sister and half-brother - had died in Nazi concentration camps.\n \n [Are your violins playing at full tilt?]\n \n Mr. Kerry, making a push for an important Democratic constituency that has warmed to the Bush administration over its Middle East policy, sought to assure the attendees that he was as strong a supporter of Israel as Mr. Bush.\n \n [It's revolting how politicians in America have no shame kissing up to the Jewish lobby]\n \n But Jack Rosen, the president of the American Jewish Congress, said Mr. Kerry, while reassuring, had not entirely won him over. Mr. Rosen said Mr. Kerry had said he would be far more engaged in the Middle East peace process than Mr. Bush. \"What does more engagement mean?\" Mr. Rosen asked. \"Because typically when Democrats accuse Bush of not being engaged enough, it's an excuse for not bullying the Israelis enough.\"\n \n [Rosen said \"He hasn't kissed as much butt for as long as some of the other politicians around. Whilst it was comfortable to have a wannabe-president pucker-up, he needs to show he enjoys it for a long period before we'll publicly rest our feet on his back as our footstool like we have with Bush\"].\n \n More repulsive brown-nosing:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/01/politics/campaign/01KERR.html",

   "Kerry Position Paper Outlines Support For Israel\n \n WASHINGTON - In a position paper outlining his stance on Israel, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry promises not to negotiate with Yasser Arafat and expresses support for Israel's right to defend itself by attacking terrorist organizations.\n \n The paper, entitled \"John Kerry: Strengthening Israel's Security and Bolstering the U.S.-Israel Special Relationship,\" was sent in mid-June to a group of people in the Jewish community as part of the Kerry attempt to maintain contact with Jewish supporters in the United States and to clarify his positions on Israel.\n ...\n Seeking to set himself apart from Bush on several issues, Kerry blasts Saudi Arabia and promises to act against anti-Semitic statements by senior Saudi government officials. \"As president, he will never permit these kinds of attacks to go unanswered,\" the paper promises.\n \n Full article:\n \n http://www.rense.com/general54/hery.htm",
