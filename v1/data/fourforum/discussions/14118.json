   "American so called colored revolutions at post Soviet area are going to be fully smashed. Kyrgyz president Bakiev offered his resignation after two days of disorders and brutal violence in Kyrgyzstan. \n Well, there's some evident logic to this. Look, in Ukraine its American president (American prot&#1081;g&#1081;) quit loosing in course of democratic elections. Then Kyrgyzstan followed and it's much worse in here! Lots of mass violence and blood were needed to kick president Bakiev out (he's also an American stooge). Who's next I wonder? I bet you this is crazy Micho, Georgian president planted in Georgia by D.C. smarties. I suspect deeply disappointed Georgians are going to force him out in nearest perspective! Americans XXXX up again an again! American democracy in action!!",
