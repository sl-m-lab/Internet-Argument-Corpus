   "Can you point me, specifically, and in layman's terms as well due to my lack of knowledge of specific Bible passages, to the part of the Bible that dictates that Roman Catholic priests must take a vow of celibacy?\n\n There is nothing in the Bible that specifically dictates that Roman Catholic priests take a vow of celibacy. This is a part of RC tradition. You may be aware that the Orthodox Church does allow their priests to marry.\n \n At least part of the reasoning behind this tradition is the idea that celibacy frees a person from the role of family-life so that they may devote their time and attention to their parish or their role as a priest. (As you implied in your post.)\n \n I think you would find that no matter where you look, people are people. Some are 'good' and some are 'bad.' Some are happy and some are unhappy. Ultimately, it has nothing to do with whether or not they enter the priesthood or take a vow of celibacy.\n \n If Maximus is still around on these forums, I bet he could give you a more thorough answer (or at least point you to some references to do a little research).",

   "Greetings to Waxy and All:\n \n \nYou asked << Can you point me, specifically, and in layman's terms as well due to my lack of knowledge of specific Bible passages, to the part of the Bible that dictates that Roman Catholic priests must take a vow of celibacy?\n\n \n Perhaps a better question would be, \"What part of the Bible supports the existence of Roman Catholic priests?\" I must assume that you have searched the web for answers to this question, as there are many sites that give a variety of answers. Like this one:\n \n http://www.answerbag.com/q_view.php/127 (Why are Catholic Priests forbidden to marry?) \n \n And here: http://www.cathinsight.com/apologetics/celibacy2.htm ( Why Celebacy?) \n \n This last fellow can give you Scriptural reasons for practicing celibacy, but nobody can provide that kind of support for a priest remaining single his entire life. Nothing like that exists among the tribes of Israel. John the Baptist was the son of Zacharias and Elizabeth. Luke 1:59+60. Where would the next generation of priests come from, if none of them married? \n \n We cannot consult Paul about the subject of 'priests,' because he only uses the word one time. \". . . to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, so that {my} offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.\" Rom. 15:16.\n \n \nWaxy << It would seem to me the church would have a lot more willing candidates, and IMHO, priests that are far more effective in their workings within the community, if they were allowed to marry and have families. Other than the time constraints involved in raising children, which I could foresee as being a problem.\n\n \n We agree. I believe a church is much better able to meet the needs of answering the questions of fathers, if the pastor has experience in raising children. Pastors with a wife and children of their own have been through the trials and tribulations that confront many of our young couples today. They possess tools which the RC priest simply does not have in his arsenal. Paul does mention the office of deacon in the church, saying, \n \n \n\"Deacons must be husbands of {only} one wife, {and} good managers of {their} children and their own households.\" 1Tim. 3:12. \n \n \n Note the 'good manager' aspect that the members of the church should use in selecting a good deacon. A man well able to manage the affairs of his own household is a good candidate to oversee the dealings of the church. How does one decide between men without families of their own? In the RC Church example, they allow other men without families to decide for you. \n \n \nWaxy << Seems like a miserable life to me. My experiences with priests have always left me pitying them. They seem lonely and rather out of touch to me, kind of disconnected from the world. I think the celibacy vow eliminates a lot of great young men from entering the priesthood, and at the same time, I think it encourages some of the \"less desirable\" young men to enter the priesthood.\n\n \n We agree on some of these points. But, please allow me to stick to what the Bible says to us in this area. Paul does give direction on how to select elders and overseers:\n \n \n\"An overseer, then, must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, prudent, respectable, hospitable, able to teach.\" 1Tim. 3:2\n \n \"For this reason I left you in Crete, that you would set in order what remains and appoint elders in every city as I directed you, if any man is above reproach, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, not accused of dissipation or rebellion.\" Titus 1:5+6.\n\n \n When I take all of Paul's words that pertain to the church together, it is most difficult to reconcile those things with what I see in the RC Church. Paul writes, \n \n \nAnd He gave some {as} apostles, and some {as} prophets, and some {as} evangelists, and some {as} pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ. Eph. 4:11+12.\n\n \n The 'body of Christ' is the church (Col. 1:8, 24, etc.) currently on this planet. God gave us His word through the Apostles and Prophets. Today we have our pastors and teachers working together to build up the body of Christ. There is an evangelist in every one of us who shares the gospel with our family, friends, co-workers, etc.. Every soul you lead to Christ is a jewel in your crown, so share the good news with All. A priest however is a horse of a totally different color indeed. \n \n Paul does not give any commands regarding priests, because we are not supposed to have any. A priest in the Hebrew tradition is one who stands in the gap and intercedes between men and God. To a Jew, a priest is, \"One consecrated to the service of the sanctuary and, more particularly, of the altar.\" \n \n ( http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=523&letter=P )\n \n You see, the altar is all about sacrifice. In OT times, when a Jew fell into transgression to Mosaic Law, he did not have the authority to pay for that sin by killing his own calf or lamb. Instead, he headed for the temple and rounded up a priest. The priests made a living by taking the choice parts of the sacrifices for themselves. This was part of the problem they had with John the Baptist coming along and, \"preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.\" Mark 1:4. How can the priest eat the best part of a water baptism? \n \n Anyway, a true 'priest' stands at the altar and makes a sacrifice for the sins of the people. Paul does not mention priesthood to us Gentiles, because Christ died on the cross for our sins. So the RC Church had to come up with a daily sacrifice to justify the existence of their priesthood. So enter the \"Holy Eucharist Sacrificial Communion Ceremony,\" which is the heart and soul of the Mass itself. \n \n Each of their Seven Sacraments represents something that a member of their priesthood is going to do for the layman. Paul says that our one baptism (Eph. 4:5) is done by the Spirit of God. 1Cor. 12:13. And yet, the very first Sacrament of the RC church is \"The Sacrament of Baptism.\" In this example, they replace our Baptism of the Spirit with Peter's water baptism for the forgiveness of sins (Acts 2:38), and allow their priest to stand in the gap between you and God. They replace the Spirit of God with a man. The Second Sacrament is The Sacrament of Confirmation, where a priest confirms his own work of the first sacrament. Works, works and more works. Perhaps the priests would have more time on his hands, if he was not contantly sacrificing our Lord over and over and over again.\n \n Paul never envisioned the body of Christ needing such services, because we have direct access to God through Christ (Rom. 8:34) and the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:26+27). We are temples of the Holy Spirit right? 1Cor. 6:19? The Spirit of God dwells in us right? \n \n \n\"But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.\" Rom. 8:11.\n \n \n God is closer to me than my own breath. There is no room for any priest to stand in the gap, because no gap exists. So? What do I need with these man-made rituals? Christ Himself is my Intercessor to the Father, \"for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.\" Eph. 2:18. \n \n Maybe this post will serve to show why many among the denominations have no priests at all.\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "You know what, I didn't even bother to search, the topic, I knew you guys would give me a better answer, and I was right.\n \n I did go and look at the links you provided though Terral. Thanks.\n \n I must say, the second one turned me right off. His explanation for some of the recent \"troubles\" within the priesthood is simply that they allowed homosexuals to \"infiltrate the priesthood\", and that they must be more diligent in their efforts to prevent homosexuals from entering the priesthood. That'll solve all their problems. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n Anyhoo,\n \n I guess I have my explanations - both historical and practical for the vow of celibacy.\n \n I can see how it serves a couple of purposes, the biggest being the test of one's conviction to God and church, the other being keeping the priest's calendar open.\n \n IMHO, neither is reason enough for the continued commitment to the \"Canon of Celibacy.\"\n \n Terral, I found your viewpoint on the RC sacraments interesting. It may surprise you to learn that I have been baptized and confirmed into the RC church. In fact, I was very recently married in the RC church, due to pressure from my our families, more so than ourselves.\n \n That was my first contact with a priest in years, and I guess my thinking about it led to this post. I truly felt sorry for the guy. He seemed rather pathetic, depressed, and out of touch, though perhaps that's just my biased impression because I simply can't understand \"his world\". \n \n What really led to this question was the fact that he was to instruct us about marriage, sexual relationships, and the raising of kids - an odd contradication to say the least. Kind of like me teaching a Bible study class or a university class on nuclear physics.\n \n Thanks again to all, I appreciate the time taken to give me the \"Priesthood for Dummies\" short course. :p\n \n Waxy",

In order to undermine the eastern church, the Popes made exceptions to those easterners who left and accepted the Pope as boss; the Uniat Churches. Take for example the Maronite Church - they acknowledge the Pope as boss, but still follow all their old Orthodox rites; and have married clergy. The Popes allowed them all these concessions in order to bring them over into the Roman church. Same with Greek Catholics, Ukraine Catholics etc.\n \n AND for Anglican priests who defect to the Catholic church, even when they become fully-fledged Roman Catholic priests, they are still allowed to be married.\n \n So we have the Roman Catholic church making all these exceptions in order to woo people away from their own church.\n \n But, I'm more concerned over Terral's question about the institution of priests per se.

   "1 Peter 2:9 establishes all of us as a universal priesthood when it states, \"You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God...\" This is the truth. The fact that we are all priests and that Christ is the supreme priest (Hebrews) does not exclude the fact that there is also a chosen priesthood in service of God. Read Exodus 19:6, \"...and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.\" Sounds a lot like 1 Peter 2:9 doesn't it? The Old Testament foreshadows the new. God proclaimed through Moses in the Old Covenant that the people of Israel were his royal priesthood a long time ago. God similarly proclaimed through Jesus in the New Covenant that all people on earth were his royal priesthood. But if you read the Old Testament you will also find the priestly line of Aaron, of the Levites and the priesthood of Melchizadek. The appointed priesthood co-existed with the universal priesthood. \n \n Jesus appointed a priesthood when he appointed the apostles. He said, \"As the Father has sent me so I send you.\" He told the apostles to perform the miracle of the Eucharist \"in memory of me.\" They were appointed to continue the Eucharistic celebration and to preach to all nations. It is seen in the first chapter of Acts that these offices were to be passed on when Matthias is elected to replace Judas. \n \n More evidence of the priesthood can be found in the New Testament. This priesthood is in a line of succession from Christ. The priesthood is appointed or called by God and approved by the current priesthood to ensure the legitimacy of their teaching. This is done by the laying on of hands-elements of the ordination and sacrament of holy orders. Read Acts 6:6, Acts 13:3, Acts 14:22. Read Acts 15:24 to see that some tried to teach and take the office of clergy but they had not been given this power by the apostles and were therefore rejected, \"Since we have heard that some persons from us have troubled you with words, though we gave them no instructions, it has seemed good to us in assembly to choose men and send them to you.\" \n \n Paul speaks of bishops and deacons in his writings and states that he is in the \"priestly service of the gospel.\" (Romans 15:16). Paul makes it clear that the gift of priesthood is given to others by those already in authority (by appointment of Christ). Not just anyone could make their confession and start preaching the gospel. This is found in 1 Timothy 4:14  and 2 Timothy 1:6 where he tells Timothy that his gift was received by the laying on of hands. In Titus 1:5 Paul commands that presbyters be appointed in each town. Matthias was appointed to take Judas' place in Acts 1. There is a priesthood. A priesthood that carries out Jesus' command of continuing the once for all but perpetual, ongoing sacrifice of Christ in the Eucharist. \n \n There is a priesthood evident in the Bible and celibacy is also evident in scripture. Jesus was celibate and endorsed celibacy (Matthew 19:12). Paul was celibate (1 Corinthians 7:8)? 1 Corinthians 7:32-35 tells us some of the reason for celibacy as you all have mentioned previously.\n \n Furthermore, celibacy is essential in conveying the fullness of Christ's message. It is a total, passionate, self-sacrifice following the example of Christ. As he gave his body and life for us, so do the celibate clergy. They give their physical pleasure and their material wealth to serve God and fellow man.\n \n Can the Church make celibacy a requirement? Most certainly. How? By the power of the Church to bind and loose for the good of the Church (Matthew 16:19).\n \n But is it a requirement or a gift from God (Notice that Jesus' words in Matthew describe it as a receiving)? After all, who forces these men to be priests? No one.",

   "For those of you who question if celibacy is related to pedophilia:\n \n Have you ever had thoughts of having sex with a child when you were in a celibate period in your life?\n \n If for some reason, your significant other died or lived but for health reasons could no longer have sex would you consider pedophilia as a normal sexual outlet/interaction?\n \n If you were required to be celibate your entire life do you think that you would be attracted to children?\n \n Pedophilia is a perversion, a sickness, a disorder. It has little to do with celibacy. \n \n In a lot of cases in the recent church scandal ephebophilia was the occurence, not pedophilia. A little less wicked but perhaps part of the rationale that homosexual clergy were a big part of the problem. And if celibacy is the problem then why does pedophilia occur in Protestant congregations at a similar rate when the pastor is not required to be celibate?",

   "Terral03 (or any others suppose),\n \n Can you point me, specifically, and in layman's terms as well due to my lack of knowledge of specific Bible passages, to the part of the Bible that dictates that Roman Catholic priests must take a vow of celibacy?\n \n It would seem to me the church would have a lot more willing candidates, and IMHO, priests that are far more effective in their workings within the community, if they were allowed to marry and have families. Other than the time constraints involved in raising children, which I could forsee as being a problem.\n \n I've always been curious about that.\n \n Seems like a miserable life to me. My experiences with priests have always left me pitying them. They seem lonely and rather out of touch to me, kind of disconnected from the world. I think the celibacy vow eliminates a lot of great young men from entering the priesthood, and at the same time, I think it encourages some of the \"less desirable\" young men to enter the priesthood.\n \n Waxy\n \n P.S. I put \"less desirable\" in quotes because it is not necessarily so, depending on your point of view. I would suggest it can mean anything from those that are somewhat somewhat socially inept, to homosexuals, to pedophiles (ALWAYS BAD). So obviously the term is a pretty broad, and admittedly somewhat useless, generalization.\n\n \n Perhaps if they did allow priests to marry, they wouldn't be sexually abusing the children they are suppose to teach.",

This requirement, according the RCC's own findings, has created a situation where young men who are emotionally and sexually immature are drawn to the RC priesthood as a means of hiding from their own personal issues.

A married priest is much better equipped to be the priest and shephard of a parish flock han a priest who is celibate and has no applicable experince with issues parishioners face in their lives as parents, and married couples.\n \n Now, if a man feels a very strong calling to be celibate, he can still be a priest.

The RCC has become a Church of checklists and bureaucracy....much like the Pharisees..\n\n \n That is the point, if they were serious about celibate priests then why make exceptions for people within the same 'class' of priests? Why have married priests up till c.1100 AD and then not? Did they just discover the 'biblical evidence' only then?\n \n In a similar vein... the RCC (to use your term) makes arguments about the filioque being said in the Mass. (For those unfamiliar see APPENDIX below). Catholic sites will argue why the filioque needs to be said AND YET they allow the original form of the Nicene Creed to be said in Uniat Churches - the same ones that they make exemptions for married priests - because that was how they lured them away from Orthodoxy.\n \n They went to Orthodox communities and basically said, \"If you switch to our church, you can keep the Mass (the Liturgy) in the exact same way as you've always done it, you can keep married priests, as you've always done. All you need do is accept the Pope as your Master\". And they made some success so that many Orthodox Churches now have Uniat parallels....\n There's the Greek Orthodox Church The Greek Catholic Church\n The Ukrainian Orthodox Church The Ukrainian Catholic Church\n The Antiochian Orthodox Church The Maronite Church\n \n Even when the Pope himself visits a Maronite Church the service has the ORIGINAL Nicene Creed said. Doesn't this make a mockery of the arguments put forward by the RCC in favour of a celibate clergy, and the introduction of the filioque?\n \n \n APPENDIX\n The Nicene Creed was one of the earliest statements of faith of the Christian Church. When it was drawn up it was agreed to that no one should add or change it unless by consent. In it, it was originally stated that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father. Several hundred years later the Pope changed this to now read \"We believe in the Holy Spirit who proceeds from the Father AND THE SON\" (and the son = filioque in Latin).\n \n Modern Version\n We believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, \n maker of heaven and earth, of all that is, seen and unseen.\n We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God,\n eternally begotten from the Father, God from God, Light from Light,\n true God from true God, begotten, not made, of the same substance as the Father.\n Through him all things were made.\n For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven:\n by the power of the Holy Spirit\n he was born of the Virgin Mary, and became man\n For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;\n he suffered, died, and was buried.\n On the third day he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures;\n he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.\n He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,\n and his kingdom will have no end. And His Kingdom will have no end: \n We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,\n who proceeds from the Father (and the Son).\n With the Father and the Son he is worshipped and glorified.\n He has spoken through the Prophets.\n We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.\n We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.\n We look for the resurrection of the dead,\n and the life of the world to come. Amen.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed",

   "Spartacus,\n \n Actually there is debate on whether celibacy might have been an apostolic tradition. Also, the RCC requirement for celibacy predates the 1200s.\n\n \n There were married RC priests during the time of the crusades. One of the reasons the Pope put a stop to it was parishioners (crusaders among them) would sometimes give a priest property as gift. If the priest had children, the property would be inherrited by them. With a celiabte priest...the property reverts back to the churhc on his passing. Also the cost of having married priests with their families was seen as a burden.\n \n Although celibacy was a very strong tradition in the West...It was not until the time of the Great schism that it became Doctrine.\n \n At the coucil of Nicea in 325...there was no required celibacy of the priesthood...until this time the Church had no unified beleifs or \"universal\" i.e. catholic Tradition. That is where I began guaging Apostlic tradition in non-scriptural matters...at 325 when the Books of the Holy Bible were first agreed upon. \n \n \n Want to be married and be an Orthodox priest? Just get married. Well, get married if you haven't taken your vows or if you are not a widower or if you don't want to be a bishop. Not so simple.

We believe Christ is the head of our Church and trust in the good sense God gave us...Orthodox use the rule of economia.(sp?)...basicly asking...\"Does this rule serve the greater good in this instance?\" When it clearly does not, exceptions can and are made in administartive areas and areas not related to basic foundations of the faith.\n \n As I understand it, it is required the priest be married prior to Ordination because the priest's wife plays an important role in parish life...often called the \"mother\" of the parish. From a practical sense it just seems logical that she begin her study of this role as her husband is in seminary, going through the process with him and and both of them deciding together if he shall actually become a priest...rather than a priest being single, dating, marrying a woman...and her not realizing what she is getting into.....it just makes good sense.",

   "To what Roman Catholic findings do you allude that report that celibacy has created a situation where sexual perversion is generated?\n\n \n There was a report realeased earlier this year....the official summary said the high percentage of homosexuals in the RC priesthood were partly to cause for the scandal...but it did point out that a good number entering the seminary are immature in many areas and are in fact looking for a way to hide from many personal issues...if you desire I shall google it and see if I can provide a link butit is late, I have just returned from vespars and have duites tomorrow AM at Divine Liturgies.\n \n \n\n In churches with optional celibacy (i.e. the Anglicans, Orthodox) is there a flood of priests?\n\n \n Yes!!!..at least in the Orthodox Church there are...in my parish we have about 200 families and six priests. That is a high percentage even for Orthodox Churches though...but the answer is YES. It is not som much a \"flood\" as it is a healthy abundance.\n \n\n Why do Anglican and Orthodox priests who are already allowed to be married convert to Catholicism?\n\n Don't know..never met one...never heard of one in the US...I don't doubt that there might be some...I just never met any...In fact never heard of any Orthodox ever becoming RC...And I used to be involved with Cathecising converts to the RCC. But in my Orthodox Parish we have a former RC Deacon who is now an Orthodx priest. We also have a former RC nun who is a degreed theologian and is a leading parishioner....in fact about 25% of our parish is former RCs.....I can tell you why some of us have left..... \n \n \n\n So you are saying that the Catholic Church has required celibacy for approximately 800 years? So why has there not been a shortage of priests until now? OVer these 800 years if celibacy was the problem would we not have seen problems with the numbers of priests previously?

(Consider also that the Catholic celibate priesthood is flourishing in other countries outside the U.S.)\n\n \n In regards to quanitity of course social issues factor heavily...in regards to quality though...Today we are living in the information age...I don't think there is any more perversion now than there is ever was before...we just know more about it, and peope are more open to talk about such things...even 30 yrs ago a boy cliaming to have been abused by a priest might very well have gotten the belt to his behind from his parents and then made to go into a confessional with the same priest who abused him. People today are just more aware and more likely to give victims the benfit of the doubt over the priest...and with good reason.\n \n \n\n And can the priest choose to be celibate? That must be qualified right? As you say, he can't choose once he is ordained to be married. And he can't choose once he is widowed to be remarried.\n\n Sure a celibate can choose to get married...but they won't be a priest. A widower priest can choose to remarry...but he won't be a priest any longer....and agin keep in mind....these are not necessarily absolutes.\n \n \n\n If a married priest is a better shepherd then why would a patriarch not be a better shepherd of his larger flock if he was married?\n\n \n Because you don't go to a Bishop with advice on what to do about a child who just fights with you every Sunday about going to church. You don't go to a Bishop to confess you lust after women other than your wife...the Bishops deal mainly with priests and parish presidents on an everyday basis..not families or indivual parishioners. \n \n \n\n If a married priest is a better shepherd then why do the Orthodox require that an unmarried person not marry once he is ordained as a priest?\n Why do they forbid a widower to remarry to enhance his shepherding abilities?\n\n \n Asked and answered\n \n \n\n If a married priest is so much better equipped then would you advocate requiring marriage of all parish priests?\nNO..just as I would not advocate requiring celibacy of all priests....I can only speak of my own experince...we have a monk who works in our parish..he is celibate and a priest...he ministers to a small ethnic group within our parish...I am sure he does a great job..but I would not know because I don't speak their language. I believe he does this and other such things and works for the Bishop...but unless there is suddenly a surge of parishioners of this one particular ethinic group...I do not think he will ever be a parish priest in that he will have his his own parish. He is still a good priest though from what I understand...and what a voice....it penetrates through to my bones...the man has some pipes! Celibate priests are often in positions of ministering to such groups...monks ((lay monastics), immigrants, missionaries, chaplains...due to their not having a wife, they tend to be drawn to duties other than the standard parish of worshipping families of husabnds, wives and children. \n \n\n You said that almost all parish priests in the Orthodox Church are married. Do you think that the Orthodox parishes with celibate clergy suffer because of their priest's celibacy? (Would he be of lower quality as you say that opening the Catholic priesthood to married individuals would raise the quality of seminarians.) \n\n \n already answered\n \n \n\n So you don't want priests who devote \"every minute of their lives\" to the Church? Wouldn't that be the fullest devotion and model of Christ?\n\n \n A model..as in perfect ideal..perhaps ...but our world is imperfect....we must be grounded in certain realities....Is it wrong for two parents to leave their children for a weekend retreat to work on their marriage? Are they ignoring their children? Or are they they becoming better parents by working to strengthen the marital relationship and giving their children good role models by doing so...This is how I view parish priests being married....being a good parent and husband makes him a better priest. Being good at one job helps him be better at the other. In the business world this is referred to as \"sharpening the saw\" or balancing life's priorities to become more productive\"...Also ..Bishops are often travelling throughout their dioceses and all over the world...it would not be much of a life for a married couple.\n \n \n\n If a bishop is required to be celibate in the Orthodox Church wouldn't he therefore be subject to the same problems you allude to in the priesthood of the Catholic Church where celibacy is required? Wouldn't this create \"a situation where young men who are emotionally and sexually immature are drawn to the [Orthodox episcopacy] as a means of hiding from their own personal issues?\"\n\n \n Perhaps...but in Orthodoxy there is no shortage of priests....I would hope that having this pool of talent to choose from reduces the chances of such people making it far in the priesthood. Not all priests go on to have a parish..some never do. SOme priests work in the real world at regular jobs...and serve only during Liturgies...it si not their phone that rings at 3 AM when aprishioner learns they have lost a child in a horrible car accident. We normally have about 4 priests serving DIvine Liturgy on Sunday...only two are receive a full salary...the others work regular jobs or are retired,and receie a lesser salary.

With the establishment of the Patriarchate in Moscow in 1589, and the expected new pressure from Moscow, the Union of Bierascie(Brest Litovsk) was forged in October 1596 which created the Uniate church. The Union was expected to raise the social status of the Orthodox, but since most of the upper class had already become fully polonized and Roman Catholic, the anticipated reprieve was not realized for even the Uniate church was prosecuted and proselitized by fanatic Latin-rite Catholics under the leadership of Jesuits.\"\n http://www.belarusguide.com/culture1/religion/BAOC.html\n There are various versions, amongst Catholics.\n There's this:\n The hierarchy of the Metropolia of Kyiv freely chose, in Orthodox synodal fashion, to pursue union with Rome in 1596. They surprised the Polish king, the papal nuncio, the Jesuits and even the pope himself. Let us remember that the Polish Jesuits had something very different in mind. They wanted the Ruthenian (Ukrainian and Belarusian ) Orthodox to accept wholesale Polonization and absorption into the Roman rite. That is not what they got, and they were therefore quite surprised by the ecclesiological turnaround proposed by the Metropolia of Kyiv. Not all the fruits (because we live in a fallen state) but many of the fruits of this union would be good, including the free choice of many to accept martyrdom for the sake of this union (a case of tyranny being transformed into freedom)\n http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/2001/240121.shtml\n And then there's...\n In 1569, when most of Ukraine became part of Poland, Protestantism was on the rise in Europe, and the Jesuits sought a local union between Catholics and Orthodox to counter the threat. The Orthodox responded favorably, not only to counter Protestantism, but as a way of preserving their Byzantine tradition in the face of the expansion in Poland of Latin Catholicism. \n http://www.ewtn.com/tv/ukrainian_catholic_church.htm\n There is much bitterness\n \"The behavior of the Orthodox looks bad and the world will condemn them for that,'' the cardinal said. However, he warned against characterizing ``the Catholics as knights on white horses or the Orthodox as people with horns and tails,'' Blagovest reported.\"\n http://www.catholicherald.com/cns/russia517.htm\n Even now the Roman Catholic Church pumps money into the east... to convert Orthodox, whilst at the same time declaring us 'brothers'.\n \"Inside it is cold and damp, and water drips through the hard-board ceiling. Its poverty is in stark contrast to the Greek Catholic Church of the Nativity easily visible at the other end of the estate. \n Father Vladimir Kuz'o, Orthodox priest \n Five years under construction, the latter's massive walls and five gold cupolas gaze down contemptuously on poor St Vladimir's.

How shall I begin to tell of the deeds wrought by these nefarious men! Alas, the images, which ought to have been adored, were trodden under foot! Alas, the relics of the holy martyrs were thrown into unclean places! Then was seen what one shudders to hear, namely, the divine body and blood of Christ was spilled upon the ground or thrown about. They snatched the precious reliquaries, thrust into their bosoms the ornaments which these contained, and used the broken remnants for pans and drinking cups, --precursors of Anti-Christ, authors and heralds of his nefarious deeds which we momentarily expect. Manifestly, indeed, by that race then, just as formerly, Christ was robbed and insulted and His garments were divided by lot; only one thing was lacking, that His side, pierced by a spear, should pour rivers of divine blood on the ground. \n \n Nor can the violation of the Great Church [note: Hagia Sophia in Constantinople] be listened to with equanimity. For the sacred altar, formed of all kinds of precious materials and admired by the whole world, was broken into bits and distributed among the soldiers, as was all the other sacred wealth of so great and infinite splendor. \n \n When the sacred vases and utensils of unsurpassable art and grace and rare material, and the fine silver, wrought with gold, which encircled the screen of the tribunal and the ambo, of admirable workmanship, and the door and many other ornaments, were to be borne away as booty, mules and saddled horses were led to the very sanctuary of the temple. Some of these which were unable to keep their footing on the splendid and slippery pavement, were stabbed when they fell, so that the sacred pavement was polluted with blood and filth\n quoted at\n http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/bible/sack.stm\n \n 3 The Athonite monks have a long memory. Not only were they the object of persecution by the Crusades, but in September each year they commemorate the feast of those monks martyred after the Council of Lyons (1274) for not accepting the union with Rome forced upon them by the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaeologos. Some of the monks of Zographos were burnt in their tower, some from Vatopedi were beheaded at Karyes, others thrown into the sea to drown. The history and tradition of the Athonite monks keep alive the adage: don't trust Rome.\n http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a39f996ba2c1f.htm",

   "Spartacus,\n \nThere were married RC priests during the time of the crusades. One of the reasons the Pope put a stop to it was parishioners (crusaders among them) would sometimes give a priest property as gift. If the priest had children, the property would be inherrited by them. With a celiabte priest...the property reverts back to the churhc on his passing. Also the cost of having married priests with their families was seen as a burden.\n \n Although celibacy was a very strong tradition in the West...It was not until the time of the Great schism that it became Doctrine.\n \n At the coucil of Nicea in 325...there was no required celibacy of the priesthood...until this time the Church had no unified beleifs or \"universal\" i.e. catholic Tradition. That is where I began guaging Apostlic tradition in non-scriptural matters...at 325 when the Books of the Holy Bible were first agreed upon. \n \n Know first that as strong as my words and arguments get in debate I hold you and other Christians as brothers in Christ. Mont and I have argued for eternity on the issues which separate the two apostolic Churches. So do not take my words as being hostile or confrontational. John Paul calls both the two lungs of the body of Christ (or something similar--it's paraphrased).\n \n But back to the debate. Check out these articles concerning celibacy in the Church:\n http://www.catholicmind.com/articles/celibacy.htm \n Note the part on St. Epiphanius.\n \n http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03481a.htm \n Note the part on clerical celibacy.\n \n \nHAHAHAHAHAHA...Firstly, on such matters, there are guidlelines...there are no strict \"rules\" as there are in the RCC. We believe Christ is the head of our Church and trust in the good sense God gave us...Orthodox use the rule of economia.(sp?)...basicly asking...\"Does this rule serve the greater good in this instance?\" When it clearly does not, exceptions can and are made in administartive areas and areas not related to basic foundations of the faith.\n\n What is wrong with rules? Do you think Christ was shy about unequivocally preaching his stance on certain issues?",

I also agree that Catholics and Orthodox have some friction between them. I think that Pope John Paul and the Patriarchs have attempted to make headway in this. I also agree that Catholics probably have done some misguided things in seeking to reunite the two churches (and the sacking of Constantinople was an abuse). \n \n I do have a problem with your assertions concerning the Catholic Church manipulating people into the Church with money and allowing married priests. You seem to put all of the \"blame\" on the Church and do not allow for the fact that these people for the most part are willfully converting. Even if money is used to woo these people in then what does it say about their faith if it is tempted with money? What is the Orthodox Church teaching that would allow their members to be wooed away with money? If this practice is going on then the Church and the converts should both be taken to task.",

   "\n What is wrong with rules? Do you think Christ was shy about unequivocally preaching his stance on certain issues?\n\n \n There is nothing wrong with rules. However when those rules are used by pharisees...and followed to the letter rather than the Spirit that was intended...that is where we get problems.\n \n \n You ask many questions...so please allow me to ask you one:\n \n \n From since before 325 AD until 1058, the Pope was viewed as \"First among equals\" among all Bishops...like a Chairman of the Board.\n \n So why is it that Cardinals during a time when ROme was between popes, excommunicated the Orthodox Churches of the East?\n \n The RCC points to Scripture where Christ declares that \"upon this rock I will build my church\"...but obviously this interpreattion of that passage was not widely any Pope prior to the 11th Century...so...Why does it hold true today...when it did not hold true for the first half of Christian history? What happened in the 11th century and before that prompted the cardianls to excommunicate the Churches of the East?\n \n Note: Orthodox beliefs, interpreatations, doctrines, Traditions and practices have changed very little in the last 1500 years...The Orthodox Churches today are as the RCC was then...so if the RCC is the \"true faith\"...then why has it changed so much? Does truth change or did the RCC have a few things wrong that Orthodox still have wrong today?\n \n To re-unite the Churches...the Pope could start the process by renouncing the concept of the Pope being infalliable and returning to the doctrine of the Pope being \"First among equals\" rather than the \"Vicar\" (stand-in) of Christ. This would be the first and biggest step. Orthodox Churches will never put themelves under the authority of the Pope. Orthodoxy has not changed its position on this issue since the first Council. The only way the Churches wil be re-united is if there is a Pope who will bring the RCC back to what it once was...given that Church's propensity to change...who knows perhapsI or my children maight actually live to see it.\n \n THe Number one reason why I left the RCC was I came to understand that it has become more of a political and cultiral affiliation than Christ's Church...at least in my experience. For me Roman Catholicsm is empty. cold and noweher near as full of the Holy Spirit as my Orthodox Church. That's just my opinion. I feel that way because:\n \n 1.) I am knowlegeable of RCC history\n \n 2.) I am knowlegeable of RCC Apologetics (which I find sort of silly as Apologetics is a protestant invention)\n \n 3.) I have seen too many changes in the RCC in my short life, that I am no longer connected to the faith of my childhood, my ancestors or most of the RCs throughout history.\n \n 4.) If all Roman Catholics were to be ressurected today...they would not recognize modern Roman Catholic MAss in the US...they would though recognize and probably be more comfortable at an Orthodox Divine Liturgy. I include the Popes in this as well.....",

   "Spartacus,\n \nThere was a report realeased earlier this year....the official summary said the high percentage of homosexuals in the RC priesthood were partly to cause for the scandal...but it did point out that a good number entering the seminary are immature in many areas and are in fact looking for a way to hide from many personal issues...if you desire I shall google it and see if I can provide a link butit is late, I have just returned from vespars and have duites tomorrow AM at Divine Liturgies.\n\n Yes, homosexuality is a problem. Maturity is not garnered simply by allowing someone to have a relationship with a woman. Seminary formation does need to change though to ensure growth of maturity and to address homosexual issues. \n \n A celibate man has an example in his own birth family of marriage and family issues so he does not necessarily need to be married to be able to address these issues. If he has come up in a good Christian household then he experiences aspects of married life and family life. I think often times there is a problem with social/sexual maturity as you said. But these people would have problems if they were married or not. And I think often that there is downright perversion and these people need serious help. Good seminary formation can alleviate this problem with social/sexual immaturity in a celibate person or otherwise. From what I have read the Legionaries of Christ address this issue well in seminary.\n \n \nYes!!!..at least in the Orthodox Church there are...in my parish we have about 200 families and six priests. That is a high percentage even for Orthodox Churches though...but the answer is YES. It is not som much a \"flood\" as it is a healthy abundance.\n\n In your parish or throughout the Orthodox Church?\n \n \nDon't know..never met one...never heard of one in the US...I don't doubt that there might be some...I just never met any...In fact never heard of any Orthodox ever becoming RC...And I used to be involved with Cathecising converts to the RCC. But in my Orthodox Parish we have a former RC Deacon who is now an Orthodx priest. We also have a former RC nun who is a degreed theologian and is a leading parishioner....in fact about 25% of our parish is former RCs.....I can tell you why some of us have left..... \n \n Please tell me why some of you have left. I would be interested to hear.\n \nIn regards to quanitity of course social issues factor heavily...in regards to quality though...Today we are living in the information age...I don't think there is any more perversion now than there is ever was before...we just know more about it, and peope are more open to talk about such things...even 30 yrs ago a boy cliaming to have been abused by a priest might very well have gotten the belt to his behind from his parents and then made to go into a confessional with the same priest who abused him. People today are just more aware and more likely to give victims the benfit of the doubt over the priest...and with good reason\n\n So in regards to quantity would you say that celibacy is not the major factor contributing to a decline in the priesthood being that we haven't seen a scarcity of priests over this long span of time since the requirement?\n \n I disagree concerning the amount of perversion in the world. There was perversion in the past but I believe there is more of it and that there is different types with the advent of the information age and with that the dissemination of pornography--as well as the breakdown of family life. Not to mention the sexual overdose we receive on store shelves and on TV.\n \n Celibacy has little to do with the Church scandal involving children or with the scarcity of priests.\n \n \nSure a celibate can choose to get married...but they won't be a priest. A widower priest can choose to remarry...but he won't be a priest any longer....and agin keep in mind....these are not necessarily absolutes.\n\n In the same way a Catholic can be married if he chooses not to be a priest. All priests choose to be a priest readily knowing that celibacy is an aspect of that in the Catholic Church. If the Catholic Church is wrong on celibacy concerning the points I responded to your previous post with, the Orthodox Church is also wrong. If the Catholic Church is right about celibacy then the Orthodox Church is also right.\n \n \nBecause you don't go to a Bishop with advice on what to do about a child who just fights with you every Sunday about going to church. You don't go to a Bishop to confess you lust after women other than your wife...the Bishops deal mainly with priests and parish presidents on an everyday basis..not families or indivual parishioners. \n \n My bishop deals with families and individual parishioners in addition to his administrative duties. The bishop shepherds the people and the priests. I guess it differs from place to place. \n \n \nAsked and answered\n\n It was? Why would they not encourage a person who is unmarried at the time of becoming a priest to get married so that he would be better equipped to deal with a parish? Why not get a widower to remarry so that he can continually learn more about married life in order to help his parishioners? \n \n \nNO..just as I would not advocate requiring celibacy of all priests....I can only speak of my own experince...we have a monk who works in our parish..he is celibate and a priest...he ministers to a small ethnic group within our parish...I am sure he does a great job..but I would not know because I don't speak their language. I believe he does this and other such things and works for the Bishop...but unless there is suddenly a surge of parishioners of this one particular ethinic group...I do not think he will ever be a parish priest in that he will have his his own parish. He is still a good priest though from what I understand...and what a voice....it penetrates through to my bones...the man has some pipes! Celibate priests are often in positions of ministering to such groups...monks ((lay monastics), immigrants, missionaries, chaplains...due to their not having a wife, they tend to be drawn to duties other than the standard parish of worshipping families of husabnds, wives and children. \n \n I think you speak more to this celibate priests ethnicity rather than to his celibacy.\n \n \nA model..as in perfect ideal..perhaps ...but our world is imperfect....we must be grounded in certain realities....Is it wrong for two parents to leave their children for a weekend retreat to work on their marriage? Are they ignoring their children? Or are they they becoming better parents by working to strengthen the marital relationship and giving their children good role models by doing so...This is how I view parish priests being married....being a good parent and husband makes him a better priest. Being good at one job helps him be better at the other. In the business world this is referred to as \"sharpening the saw\" or balancing life's priorities to become more productive\"...Also ..Bishops are often travelling throughout their dioceses and all over the world...it would not be much of a life for a married couple.\n\n The Kingdom of God is perfect and the Kingdom of God on earth is also called to be perfect, \"Be perfect as my Father in heaven is perfect.\" While it may be true (although not certain) that marriage could make a person a better priest it may not be true that it would make him the best priest. Those who are celibate priests offer a total, passionate, self-sacrifice following the example of Christ. As Christ gave his body and life for us, so do the celibate clergy. They give their physical pleasure and their material wealth to serve God and fellow man. They are concerned with the affairs of the Lord not with the affairs of a household.\n \n \nPerhaps...but in Orthodoxy there is no shortage of priests....I would hope that having this pool of talent to choose from reduces the chances of such people making it far in the priesthood. Not all priests go on to have a parish..some never do. SOme priests work in the real world at regular jobs...and serve only during Liturgies...it si not their phone that rings at 3 AM when aprishioner learns they have lost a child in a horrible car accident. We normally have about 4 priests serving DIvine Liturgy on Sunday...only two are receive a full salary...the others work regular jobs or are retired,and receie a lesser salary. They also help out and back up the other priests...one thing about being Orthodox...you don't need to schedule an appt. with the parish secretary...and your meeting is not limited to a 20 minute slot...they are there for you when you need them.\n\n So it is the screening process that would allow these type of people to get into the priesthood that is the true problem. Celibacy is not the problem as you asserted previously. If it was then your bishops would have problems.\n \n \nContrast that to a typical US PArish where one priest has a parish of perhaps 6,000 people...AIYAi yai..at my RC Parish the priest only gave such access to the \"tithers\" or the politically connected or influnecial...we regualr slobs...even if we were active..had to schedule an appt...usually 2 weeks out or more....and during business hours too...so you better be ready to take off of work if you want a chat. The two times I did speak with my former RC priest for advice on serious family matters concerning how my sister was neglecting her children...his advice was worse than useless...it showed he had no basis in the everyday world of his parishioners...his advice...\"pray the rosary everyday and call the police\". If he had any experience in the real world of the family lives of his parishioners he would have realized the neglect I described did not rise (sink) to a level sufficient to warrant state action as having two drunks for parents is not reason for State intervention so long as the children are going to school, show no signs of physical abuse, are fed, and not being denied medical treatment...the phone call I made to the Police had severe reprecussions...We had no access to the children for more than a year, when what I should have been doing is seeing to the children...Those kids suffered as a result of this bad counsel..and I let the priest know it....despite being a priest for more than 20 yrs he confessed to me...\"well you kow we're really not the best at handling much beyond spiritual matters like sacrements and deaths\". He should have told me this up front as I called him because I did not know what to do...he should have said \"I don't think I can offer any practical advice...but I know Susan M. in our parish is a social worker..I'll ask her to call you is that alright?\"\n\n I think you are generalizing the failure of your particular priest into an endictment of the entire celibate priesthood in general. Priests are human. They make mistakes. They all have different talents. Many priests are good at handling those types of issues. I'm sorry for the painful experience that you and the children went through.\n \n \nJudging from your line of questioning, you seem to be following the apologetics guidelines as published in the San Juan Catholic Seminars materials..are you?\n\n No, I am not. I simply responded to your assertions. I have skimmed some of the San Juan stuff and use it for reference occasionally but I don't rely heavily on their material--except for their scriptural concordance sheet--it's a great reference tool.",

   "Maximus,\n \n I will cut to the quick here. Here is my opinion, beliefs and impressions of the Roman Catholic Church.\n \n Things began to go astray in the 9 century. When Charlemagne by threat of arms re-installed one Pop, that Pope (forget his name) decided to crown Charlemagne as the \"Holy Roman Emperor\".\n \n This is where we find the moment in Church History where it started to become focused more and more on politics and earthly things. The RCC further devolved when the Popes began sending Armies tothe Holy Land -- off to war. Not a war to repel an invasion...but a foreign expedition. How can a true Church with Christ as the head actually order armies off to war? Where is the scriptural basis in this?\n \n Around this time we also see other things chaging in the RCC:\n \n The required celibacy of the priesthood.\n \n The Augustinian concept of Purgatory included as Dogma\n \n The belief in indulgances\n \n The belief in the concept of the \"stain of original sin\"..that we are all guilty of the first sin as if we actuially committed it...rather than only suffering the consequences of the sins of Adam and Eve. The child of a criminal suffers from his father's sin...but he is not guilty of his father's sin....\n \n Limbo\n \n The separation of the sacrements into baptism, confirmation and Holy COmmunion.\n \n \n \n I have to come to view these changes in Dogma not so much based in scripture...but bnased in a desire or need to control people.\n \n In this century I see where Roman Catholicism in the US has become more like proetstanism with the plethora of changes that have occurred with little explanation in the last 30 years:\n \n turning the altar around\n \n no more fasting before reciving Holy Communion\n \n A lack of belief among laiety that the Eucharist is the actual precious body and actual precious blood of Christ. This is only indicative of a general ignorance among most RCs about what their church actually believes. For instance a recent survey indicated about 60% of Rcs do not believ the Eucharist is the actual precious body and actual precious blood fo Christ. In France it is even worse...80% of people identifying themselves as Catholic do not even believe in the resurrection! They are not even Christian! Yet they still call themselves ROman Catholic. When I read this survey it remonded me of all the doubts and lack of faith I encountered among many in the ROman Catholic Church. Give me some time and I will give you the details of the study as I do not have it in front of me.....\n \n For me....I have not changed...My beliefs have always been Orthodox. As a teen I pulled out of my confirmation class two weeks before I was to be confirmed. I had too much respect for the Church to say I believed everything it taight..when in fact I did not. I continued to practice with a short period of agnosticism in my late teens. Eventually 4 years ago I decided I would do what most Catholics I know did and just try to ignore the differences I had with the RCC...So at the age of 35 I was finally confirmed after almost my entire being a practicing RC. For me it did not take.\n \n I am still catholic....I am just no longer a member of the Roman Catholic Church. Finding the Orthodox Church for me was like finally finding my home.",

   "I must state again that I don't agree with Spartacus' assertions regarding the morality of married/un-married priests; that un-married priests are more likely perverted.\n \nMont, \n I agree with you that many do not know as much about the Orthodox Church as they do the Catholic Church. I also agree that Catholics and Orthodox have some friction between them\n\n Yes, it works both ways. Currently the focus is on Russian Orthodox picking on Catholics in Russia - happened since the time of Stalin.\n In the midst of WWII after persecuting the Orthodox Church for some decades, the Soviets decided they needed every ounce (gram) of support they could muster; and turned to the Orthodox Church. The Orthodox Church inevitably benefited much by this. The Catholic Church (being controlled by an outside prince; the Pope) was viewed with suspicion, and both Communists and Orthodox did their level best to persecute the Catholic Church in Russia... however, this might have been viewed somewhat as payback for persecutions done when Poland-Lithuania ruled a great portion of the land.\n \n I think that Pope John Paul and the Patriarchs have attempted to make headway in this. I also agree that Catholics probably have done some misguided things in seeking to reunite the two churches (and the sacking of Constantinople was an abuse).\n\n I find it hard to accept JP II's statements on this, because whilst on one hand he calls Orthodox the closest church to Catholicism, he is quite happy about gaining 'converts' with great trucks of resources poured in.\n One would ask, if we're so close, why try to undermine our Church? The underlying reason is that in conservative Catholic circles the view is you're not saved if you're not Catholic (the exception being if you've never had the opportunity to choose Catholicism)\n \nI do have a problem with your assertions concerning the Catholic Church manipulating people into the Church with money and allowing married priests.\n\n If you have an alternate theory for why they allowed all these eastern groups to\n a) retain their married clergy\n b) retain their original liturgy\n AND YET argue against these things everywhere else... I'd be glad to here it.\n \nYou seem to put all of the \"blame\" on the Church and do not allow for the fact that these people for the most part are wilfully converting. Even if money is used to woo these people in then what does it say about their faith if it is tempted with money?\n\n Indeed, what does it say about the people you're accepting into your church!\n \nWhat is the Orthodox Church teaching that would allow their members to be wooed away with money?\n\n You're assuming that the Orthodox Church which is without fault is to be blamed for imperfect people acting with fault.\n \nIf this practice is going on then the Church and the converts should both be taken to task.\n\n I repeat, what kind of church would wish for such people?\n \n \nhehehehe,\n I gave mine to a fellow Orthodox parishioner who holds an advanced degree in theology and happens to be the head of the religion dept. and a campus minister at a large Roman Catholic School\n\n Could I suggest that you give ALL of your posts for them to comment on?

   "Spartacus,\n \nYou ask many questions...so please allow me to ask you one:\n \n From since before 325 AD until 1058, the Pope was viewed as \"First among equals\" among all Bishops...like a Chairman of the Board.\n \n So why is it that Cardinals during a time when ROme was between popes, excommunicated the Orthodox Churches of the East?\n \n The RCC points to Scripture where Christ declares that \"upon this rock I will build my church\"...but obviously this interpreattion of that passage was not widely any Pope prior to the 11th Century...so...Why does it hold true today...when it did not hold true for the first half of Christian history? What happened in the 11th century and before that prompted the cardianls to excommunicate the Churches of the East?\n\n You say that no Pope held that Peter's Chair was superior in authority to other bishop's before the 11th Century? So if I find a statement by just one pope prior to the 11th Century explaining Peter's primacy then this argument fails. How about looking at the writings of Pope Leo I, a pope, and an Orthodox saint??\n \n Pope Leo I\n \"Our Lord Jesus Christ . . . established the worship belonging to the divine religion. . . . But the Lord desired that the sacrament of this gift should pertain to all the apostles in such a way that it might be found principally in the most blessed Peter, the highest of all the apostles. And he wanted his gifts to flow into the entire body from Peter himself, as if from the head, in such a way that anyone who had dared to separate himself from the solidarity of Peter would realize that he was himself no longer a sharer in the divine mystery. . . . [You, my brothers], must realize with us, of course, that the Apostolic See-out of reverence for it, I mean-has on countless occasions been reported to in consultation by bishops even of your own province [Vienne]. And through the appeal of various cases to this see, decisions already made have been either revoked or confirmed, as dictated by long-standing custom\" (Letters 10:2-3 [A.D. 445]). \n \n \"As for the resolution of the bishops which is contrary to the Nicene decree, in union with your faithful piety, I declare it to be invalid and annul it by the authority of the holy apostle Peter\" (ibid., 110). \n \n \"If in your view, [Anastasius of Thessalonica], in regard to a matter to be handled and decided jointly with your brothers, their decision was other than what you wanted, then let the entire matter, with a record of the proceedings, be referred to us. . . . Although bishops have a common dignity, they are not all of the same rank. Even among the most blessed apostles, though they were alike in honor, there was a certain distinction of power. All were equal in being chosen  [to be apostles], but it was given to one to be preeminent over the others. . . . [So today through the bishops] the care of the universal Church would converge in the one see of Peter, and nothing should ever be at odds with this head\" (ibid., 14:11).\n \n If you want further elaboration of Pope Leo's ideas concerning Peter's primacy then you can click here:\n \n http://ic.net/~erasmus/RAZ235.HTM \n \n This does not mention the countless other Church Fathers who spoke in favor of Peter's primacy. This does not mention the Eastern Patriarchs who were over churches that became Orthodox churches that defend the papacy. Click here:\n \n http://web.globalserve.net/~bumblebee/ecclesia/patriarchs.htm \n \n You also say that the Church's interpretation of Peter the Rock is a late invention but I have to quote only one person to specifically refute that also (not mentioning Pope Leo above):\n \n Cyprian of Carthage(bishop and martyr)\n \"The Lord says to Peter: 'I say to you,' he says, 'that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell will not overcome it. And to you I will give the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever things you bind on earth shall be bound also in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth, they shall be loosed also in heaven' [Matt. 16:18-19]). ... On him [Peter] he builds the Church, and to him he gives the command to feed the sheep [John 21:17], and although he assigns a like power to all the apostles, yet he founded a single chair [cathedra], and he established by his own authority a source and an intrinsic reason for that unity. Indeed, the others were also what Peter was [i.e., apostles], but a primacy is given to Peter, whereby it is made clear that there is but one Church and one chair. So too, all [the apostles] are shepherds, and the flock is shown to be one, fed by all the apostles in single-minded accord. If someone does not hold fast to this unity of Peter, can he imagine that he still holds the faith? If he [should] desert the chair of Peter upon whom the Church was built, can he still be confident that he is in the Church?\" (The Unity of the Catholic Church 4; 1st edition [A.D. 251]). \n \n Now, the above confirms the Apostolic Tradition of Papal Primacy held in the Catholic Church but you seem to think that Matthew 16:18  was the only scriptural reference the Church relied on to appoint Peter and his successors as the head of the Church. You also question the meaning of Matthew 16  due to the languages of scripture. So let us address scripture now. Here is an explanation of the abundance of scriptural support for the Catholic papacy and this is only a summary:\n \n First, do you believe that a man should be the head of a Christian household? (Scripture tells us he should-the presentation of God the Father, Jesus taking the form of man, Adam being the first human creation and woman being created from man, etc.) (This is not misogyny either--Ephesians 5 is the foundation).\n \n If you answered yes to the above question then think about this: Why would God do anything less with his own household, the Church? It has been so throughout the history of the world of Judaism and Christianity. God always put someone in charge of his people to be his voice and administrator on earth. He always placed a father to lead the household of God-Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, the judges, Saul, David, Solomon...Jesus...then Peter...then the Popes...the fathers of the household. This is a simple explanation that couples with the overwhelming scriptural evidence for Peter's primacy that shows us the nature of God and his plan for his kingdom. \n \n Peter the Rock\n \n There are many problems with a denial of Peter as the foundation of the Church in Matthew 16. There are the problems of language and translation, grammar, geography, significance of the keys as it relates to the Old Testament, the reason for name changes, and the testament of the Church Fathers. There are too many indications in scripture of Peter's primacy to be discounted as mere coincidence.\n \n Was it necessary that Christ establish Peter as the anchor and foundation of his Church? One might just as well ask if the incarnation of Christ was needed by God our Father to bring about our salvation. God is omnipotent and omniscient so it is a denial of God to say that he could not grant us salvation without embodying Himself in Christ. Yet, he sent Christ, though He is capable of performing Christ's mission Himself without taking on human form (excluding any Trinitarian chicken versus egg tangents). Why did He do this? We can never fully know. We can never fully grasp, as humans, God's plan and will. Yet He did will that Christ be our Savior. Perhaps, it was the best way to make humans understand (as much as possible) his plan. He related to us on our level. So too, Christ did not need Peter, but he chose Peter. Christ was the most efficacious way of bringing about our salvation and Peter was the most efficacious way of establishing Christ's Church on earth. The statement of Paul on Christ does not exclude the statement of Christ on Peter. As Christ was the cornerstone that the Jews rejected because they didn't recognize him, Peter is the stone of foundation for the Church that Protestants reject because they do not recognize him.\n \n In Greek, \"Petros\" is used to refer to the name of Peter while \"petra\" is used to refer to the rock. The claim is that \"petros\" refers to a small stone, while \"petra\" refers to a massive rock. Therefore, Christ is referring to Peter as a small stone and to the declaration of faith or Himself as the large stone. There are several problems with this argument. The major problem is the fact that the Greek does not matter. Jesus did not speak in Greek; he spoke in Aramaic. Matthew's Gospel was originally written in Aramaic. In Aramaic the word for rock is \"kepha.\" Remember that Peter is referred to as Cephas and Kephas in scripture also.\n \n The use of \"petros\" and \"petra\" came about with the translation from Aramaic to Greek. The Greek word for rock, \"petra,\" is feminine in gender. Although it could be applied to the reference to a stone rock, it could not be applied to Peter as a name because he was obviously a male. The substitution of the masculine \"petros\" was necessary. That is why it appears to many whom are ignorant of the subtleties of Greek (myself included) that Jesus is saying, \"You are a little rock (petros) but upon this big rock (petra) I build my Church.\" Another refutation of this meaning is the fact that petros and petra were synonyms in first century Greek. The distinction between the two words was gone by the first century. If the author wanted to make a distinction he would have used the Greek word lithos.\n \n So for a closer idea of what Christ said, one must substitute the Aramaic, \"You are kepha and upon this kepha I build my Church.\" The true play on words Jesus intended can be seen using the Aramaic. The English rendering of this is closer to the original than the Greek because English nouns do not express gender. It could just as well be written, \"You are Rock and upon this rock I will build my Church.\"* The name change, in itself, is significant. The change of name was a change of role or vocation as in the name changes pronounced by God upon Abram (Abraham) to become the father of the faith and Jacob ( Israel) to become the progenitor of the tribes of Israel named after his sons. (If Jesus would have said, \"You are Simon and on the rock of your profession I build my Church\" then I could see your idea on Peter's profession. However, with the name change occurring at that very moment along with the grammar problems, and what I discuss below, this theory does not hold up). \n \n *(from www.catholic.com click on Peter and the Papacy) \n \n One must also consider the geography. Jesus and the apostles were in the district of Caesarea Philippi (Matthew 16:13). This city was built and named by Philip Herod in honor of Caesar Augustus to gain favor with Rome. The city was formerly named Panias in ancient times in honor of the god Pan. The ruins of this ancient city lie near a huge rock promontory 200 feet high and 500 feet long that are part of the Mount Hermon range of mountains. Pagan idols once decorated this mountain. Father Stanley Jaki describes it thus in his book And On This Rock, \"A splendid pagan city lying in clear sight of a huge wall of rock. At the top of that wall there glitters the white marble of a temple dedicated to Caesar. At the bottom, there is an outwardly idyllic sanctuary of Pan. Immediately to the left of that sanctuary there is a fathomless cavity full of water, one of the three sources of the Jordan.\" One of three sources of the river Jordan flowed from this mountain. The Jordan gave life to Israel. Jesus knew the power of symbolism, as no one will argue when they read the numerous parables of the gospels. The faith of Christianity flows through the rock of Peter to give life as the Jordan flowed through the other rock. The cavity mentioned in the quote was known by the inhabitants as the \"Gates of Sheol\" -but the gates of hell would not prevail against Peter and the Church. Besides the symbolism effected above, Jesus was definitely trying to drive home two important points to the apostles: 1) Christ is true God, not Caesar or Pan 2) the temple of the false gods are built upon a huge, unmovable rock but Christ's Church would be built upon the more immense rock of Peter. Remember Jesus' teaching earlier in Matthew that one must build upon a foundation of rock, not upon sand. The Church of Christ is built upon Christ the cornerstone primarily and Peter the Rock secondarily.*\n \n *(Patrick Madrid, Pope Fiction (Santa Fe: Basilica Press, 1999), 37-50. Karl Keating, Catholicism and Fundamentalism (San Francisco: Ignatius Press), 198-214.)\n \n The next issue is the \"keys of the kingdom.\" Again Jesus uses Old Testament parallel and symbolism. You say that the authority to bind and loose was given to all of the apostles as indicated by the plural Greek in Matthew 18:18. I have no argument with that. What you don't mention is the fact that it was given to Peter first and in a special way in Matthew 16:19  and this is indicated by use of the singular pronoun. Only Peter was given the keys. What's the big deal about the keys? Read Isaiah 22:15-25. In ancient times cities were walled. Huge gates guarded the entrance and could only be unlocked by huge keys. The kingdoms of ancient times were obviously ruled by kings. However, the king could not be continuously running to the gates to let people into the city. So the king gave the keys to the city to his steward. Keys that were so big the steward had to carry them on his shoulder. The steward controlled whom the king would and would not see. (This is the origin of the modern honor of giving someone a key to the city although I just learned this recently). \n \n As one reads Isaiah 22, he realizes how much authority the steward possessed. He was second only to the King. He was Prime Minister. Peter was designated as the steward/prime minister of Christ. Christ is the King. Look at the Old Testament reference to Daniel 7 in Luke 1:32-33, \"...and the Lord will give to him the throne of David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there will be no end.\"\n Then read closely the passage of Isaiah... \"Come, go to this steward, to Shebna, who is over the household...and I will clothe him with your robe, and will bind your girdle on him, and will commit your authority to his hand; and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. And I will place on his shoulder the key of the house of David; he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open. And I will fasten him like a peg in a sure place, and he will become a throne of honor to his father's house. And they will hang on him the whole weight of his father's house, the offspring and issue...\" Jesus knew Old Testament scripture better than anyone. He was making parallels between the keys of his heavenly kingdom and the way the keys were passed in the ancient kingdoms of Israel! Jesus would ascend his throne in heaven and leave Peter as his steward on earth (thus Peter's supremacy as Pastor does not contradict Christ's role as chief shepherd, rather Peter's supremacy comes from and is designated by Christ to rule the earthly Church once Christ was in heaven). All authority is committed to Peter's hand to rule over the household of his Father. \"None shall open what he shuts\"=none shall loose what he has bound and vice versa. He would become a throne of honor to the father but he does not detract from the Father. He has only the power granted to him by Christ but this power is much greater than Protestants pretend. \n \n Now consider also the significance of the pope speaking ex cathedra, that is \"from the chair.\" What chair and why is this chair so important? This chair is the chair of Moses. In Matthew 23  Jesus told his disciples to do what the Pharisees told them to do because they sat on the chair of Moses. \"Do what they tell you, but not what they do.\" Read Exodus 18  explaining the chair of Moses. It was the chair of judgement, the chair from which Moses instituted God's laws. Jesus put a new steward in the chair. As Moses was given his authority at Mount Sinai by God, Peter was given his at the mountain of Caesarea Philippi by Jesus. Moses had the power to judge, \"Moses sat to judge the people.\" He also had teaching authority, \"and you shall teach them the statutes and the decisions, and make them know the way in which they must walk and what they must do.\" Peter has these powers because he sits on the new chair of the Church. Moses spoke for God and Peter spoke for Jesus. \n \n Another clear example of Peter's primacy can be found in the Gospel of John, chapter 21: 15-19. Jesus' words here designate Peter as shepherd. Jesus again singles out Peter to lead the flock, in effect Jesus appoints Peter to be the chief shepherd. The Church did not appoint Peter shepherd, it only recognizes that Christ appointed him shepherd. The Church is obedient to Christ in accepting Peter. If one thinks that the designation of shepherd is not a designation of leadership then remember how often Christ referred to himself as the shepherd. \n \n Now, there is a volume of other evidence pointing toward Peter as prime minister that is more than coincidence, as I mentioned above. Although Peter was not the first to be called, after being called he always seemed to be first. In Matthew 10  he is listed first in the list of the apostles. The Greek word protos is used to designate him. This word means \"foremost,\" \"best,\" or \"chief.\" Peter's name is listed first in every scriptural listing of the apostles and sometimes they are referred to as \"Peter and the others.\" (Judas is always listed last). Peter's name is mentioned 195 times in the New Testament, more than all of the other apostles added together. The next closest is John at 34 times. Jesus chose Peter's boat from which to preach and work miracles. Peter is the only apostle to be personally prayed for by Jesus (Luke 22:31-32) and he tells Peter to \"strengthen his brethren.\" The risen Christ appeared first to Peter (Luke 24:34, 1 Corinthians 15:5). Peter headed the meeting to replace Judas, he led the apostles in preaching on Pentecost and received the first converts, he performed the first pentecost miracle, inflicted the first punishment, excommunicated the first heretic, etc. The Church Fathers also testify to Peter's primacy.\n \n If you are cut off from the head of the Body of Christ in the pope then you are not in full communion with the Church that Jesus established.",

Because Jesus wanted him to have it. Cross reference Matthew 16:18  with Isaiah as I mentioned in my previous post. Other relevant passages: Matthew 28:20, Luke 10:16, John 16:13.\n 2. Because absolute authority is the only way unity can be preserved (one of the 4 marks of the Church--one, holy, catholic, apostolic). The Church must be one body: John 10:16, Ephesians 4:3-6, Phillipians 2:2, 1 Corinthians 12:13.\n \n Ask yourself two questions:\n 1. The Orthodox do not often lay down dogma. Could it be due to the fact that they have no uniting authority that will allow them to enforce dogma? Do the Orthodox have any power that would allow them to cause an effect  on the universal church? If not, then where is its universality? It does not seem as though we should call it the Orthodox Church. It seems as though it is the many Orthodox churches.The same problem that is happening in the Anglican Church with ordaining a homosexual bishop could conceivably occur in the Orthodox churches. Or any number of doctrinal errors or inventions could occur...because there is no uniting, binding authority on the churches as a whole. Lack of this authority that is outside of a single church, lack of the authority that is truly international and universal, leads to a loose association of single, national churches with single, national authority.\n \n 2. Do the blemishes of papal history change the fact that Jesus appointed Peter as the head of his Church and the fact that apostolic succession warrants this headship be continued?\n \n Read about the papacy from the viewpoint of Russian Orthodox layman, Vladimir Soloviev (1853-1900). I've already told Mont about him. I read an article about him in a magazine a while back. He was actually in favor of the Orthodox Church reuniting with the Catholic Church because of our intimate relation in faith and his belief in the necessity of the pope. I think he also may address the filioque. He was ridiculed by the Orthodox for his beliefs. \n \n Here is the article mentioned above in which Soloviev puts forth some convincing arguments:\n http://www.crisismagazine.com/november2003/ryland.htm \n \n The book in which he put forth his ideas is Russia and the Universal Church (1895). There is an abridged version put out by Catholic Answers (I know that might make you skeptical) called The Russian Church and the Papacy (2001). (their website is www.catholic.com). \n \n Peace.",

   "Spartacus,\n \nTHe Number one reason why I left the RCC was I came to understand that it has become more of a political and cultiral affiliation than Christ's Church...at least in my experience. For me Roman Catholicsm is empty. cold and noweher near as full of the Holy Spirit as my Orthodox Church. That's just my opinion. I feel that way because:\n \n 1.) I am knowlegeable of RCC history\n \n 2.) I am knowlegeable of RCC Apologetics (which I find sort of silly as Apologetics is a protestant invention)\n\n The Catholic Church can never be less than Christ's Church although its people may not live up to being Christ's Church. It is Christ's Church until the end of time and no one else's. The politicians cannot claim it and the culture cannot claim it. The Catholic Church is Jesus' Church because it is the Church he founded.\n \n Regarding RCC Apologetics...There is nothing silly about defending one's faith 1 Peter 3:15  \"Always be prepared to make a defense to any one who calls you to account for the hope that is in you, yet do it with gentleness and reverence...\" Apologetics has been around since the inception of the Church. Apologists defeated heresies at every turn. Thank God for apologists so that we may know the truth.\n \n \n3.) I have seen too many changes in the RCC in my short life, that I am no longer connected to the faith of my childhood, my ancestors or most of the RCs throughout history.\n\n You are still connected-The faith \"changes\" because it is an organic, living thing. It develops while retaining the essential truth of the Revelation of God. None of that has changed. \"The Church is a thing that we [will] meet two thousand years [after its beginning] rushing through the ages as the winged thunderbolt of thought and everlasting enthusiasm; a thing without rival or resemblance; and still as new as it is old.\" G.K. Chesterton The Everlasting Man.\n \n \n4.) If all Roman Catholics were to be ressurected today...they would not recognize modern Roman Catholic MAss in the US...they would though recognize and probably be more comfortable at an Orthodox Divine Liturgy. I include the Popes in this as well.....\n\n Have you ever heard of the Tridentine Latin Mass? It is the Mass of pre-Vatican II and it has gone on since Vatican II. We also have the Novus Ordo, the \"new\" Mass. A liturgy invoked for the people. One to broaden their understanding and faith. One with the same meaning as the Tridentine Mass. Would all of the Roman Catholics recognize Mass upon resurrection? I would think so. You see, they would all recognize the REAL PRESENCE of the EUCHARIST. That is preserved in the acceptable and appropriate liturgies of both the Novus Ordo  and the Tridentine Mass. (Do not think I am saying that there is not Liturgical abuse out there--there are some wacko liturgies going on.)\n \n More later on indulgences, purgatory, and the Crusades.\n Peace.",

The Liturgy has cahnged very little since the 8 century. SHould Orthodoxy insititute any changes it would be as the result of an ecumenical council.\n\n Are the members of the Orthodox Church required to believe the tenets of the Nicene Creed? It may be called core beliefs but you have dogma (just like you have \"apologetics\"). If you wouldn't then your church wouldn't remain stable very long because dogma prevents the rule of heresy. \n \n \n2.) Orthodox view the Church as being who is in communion with whom. All Eastern Orthodox are in communion with each other...Greeks, Russians, etc....However there are some oriental Orthodox we are nmot in communion with -- Coptics, Indian Orthodox, Ethiopian Orthodox, etc.\n\n And is there anyone who can make a ruling that would affect all of the churches that are in communion with one another?\n \n \n3.) Ecumenical councils decide these things.\n\n When was your last ecumenical council?\n \n \n4.) If Peter was to be the sole authority then: \n \n Why does Christ imeedaitaely associate Peter with Satan in the verse right after declaring He will build his Church on the ROck of Peter's proclamation of faith?\n\n That's a good question. If there was scandal with Jesus' words as you seem to propose then you will also have to explain why you believe in someone who would be a vacillating flip-flopper like that. Why would you believe in such a man/God? \n \n Why would Jesus bless someone, tell him he was the rock upon which His Church would be based, and give him the keys to the kingdom of God and then call him Satan? Can you answer that question? Perhaps it was because Peter was trying to protect Jesus too zealously. He was still using human reason instead of accepting the will of God, (see the latter part of Matthew 16:23).\n \n \nWHy did Vhrist even bother with other the Apostles? Afterall...if it is all supposed to be Peter...why did He nned the others?\n\n There were 12 apostles one to represent each of the twelve tribes of Israel. The apostles had the power to heal, the power to forgive sins, to preach the good news to all nations, to break bread, and to legislate in communion with Peter.\n \n \nAlso In the Gospels Christ speaks literally and in allegory and parable. We see Him speaking literally when He says\" This is my Body\" Christ did not say \"This is 'like' my Body.\" If Christ truly wanted Peter to rule with absolute authority, then this would have been recorded as such -- particularliry by the other Apostles.\n\n I think the scriptural and early Church information I have supplied in my previous post gives a pretty clear indication of Peter's rule. Have you read John 21:15-19  when Jesus tells Peter 3 times to feed and tend the sheep? Have you read Luke 22:32  where Jesus prays specifically for Peter that his faith may not fail and charges him with the responsibility of strengthening the rest of the brethren?\n \n \n \n \n \n\n What you seem unwilling or unable to admit is:\n Every Pope before the 1th Century was satisfied with their position as \"First among equals\" with the other patriarchs. It was in fact earthly issues of politics, power and greed that compelled a popeless vatican to excommunicate the Churches of the East so that the next elected Pope would have total authority...This excommunication was then followed by the Pope's crusaders sacking Constantinoble and committing horrible attrocities in the presence (goading?) of Roman Priests.\n \n So how are we to judge the fruits of this tree? What did the Orthodox do to deserve torture, rape and murder in Constantinoble at the hands of the Pope's soldiers?\n\n I have already provided quotes that show that your hypothesis of popes being satisfied with \"first among equals\" is not tenable. \n \n I'm not sure what you are talking about when you say a popeless vatican. Are you speaking of the 1300s when the residence of the papacy was moved to Avignon, France?\n \n Furthermore, the sacking of Constantinople was wrong and I have acknowledged that earlier to Montalban. However, the Pope did not order it or approve of it. The crusaders abused their power and attacked the wrong place.\n \n \nYou also fail to address at all, how the Pope has seen fit to change core beliefs since the Great schism other than to say \"He is the Pope\".\n\n You will have to identify which beliefs you are talking about. The pope does not change beliefs because \"He is the Pope.\" He does not change things on whims. He cannot change the Revelation of God made known by Jesus Christ. He is only a messenger.\n \n \nThe only way East will unit with the West is for the Pope to accept being \"First among equals\" again. SInce the Schism Orthodoxy has not changed -- but Roman Catholicism has.\n\n Or perhaps the east will humbly submit to proper authority as Christ gave us that example in his life. Perhaps they will submit as they did in the past as I showed with the quotes from those in the Eastern Churches prior to the Schism.\n \n \nHERE's a Big question...Maximus, have you ever attended an Orthodox Divine Liturgy?\n\n No, I haven't but I'm sure it is a beautiful thing.\n \n Peace.",

   "Spartacus,\n \nI will cut to the quick here. Here is my opinion, beliefs and impressions of the Roman Catholic Church.\n \n Things began to go astray in the 9 century. When Charlemagne by threat of arms re-installed one Pop, that Pope (forget his name) decided to crown Charlemagne as the \"Holy Roman Emperor\".\n \n This is where we find the moment in Church History where it started to become focused more and more on politics and earthly things. The RCC further devolved when the Popes began sending Armies tothe Holy Land -- off to war. Not a war to repel an invasion...but a foreign expedition. How can a true Church with Christ as the head actually order armies off to war? Where is the scriptural basis in this?\n\n The Crusades get bad press but few acknowledge that they were a response to Muslim aggression. I believe that the first Crusade took place well over 400 years after the Muslims first began attacking Christian lands (Mont correct me if I'm wrong). Few acknowledge that if the Crusades had not been fought that we might today live in a Muslim world. And the oppression of Islam is much worse than the liberty of Christianity. \n \n What wars are scripturally justified? There are probably some depending on what side you were on. What about the Union's fight against slavery? Would World War I or WWII qualify? What about our attempts to protect the Vietnamese or South Koreans? \n \n What do you think Jesus was speaking of in Matthew 10:39 when he said, \"Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law againts her mother-in-law; and a man's foes will be those of his own household. He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and he who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.\" \n \n What do you think of Jesus throwing the tables and goods over in the temple and expelling the merchants with such vigor? Was that a \"violent\" action at all? What of his calling the Pharisees and Saducees hypocrites and condemning them to their face for wrongdoing?\n \n I do believe Christians can justly fight in a war. There is just violence and there is unjust violence. I believe that Christians are always ready and willing to fight in a war...because Christians believe in a right and wrong. They believe in right and wrong/good and evil so strongly that they are willing to fight for it. (They are willing to take action. Just as Jesus was willing to take action). I would not like to see what would have happened if everyone stood by in World War II or even in the Crusades. \n \n To rely on Chesterton, \"a good war is sometimes better than a bad peace.\" I would be inclined to say that the Christians at the time of the Crusades were experiencing a bad peace or no peace at all with the advancing presence of the Muslims. Action was necessary.",

He did not teach war or violence. His actions in the temple were righteous idignation...he struck no man or harmed no person...merely expressed anger how earthly things had defiled the temple.

I don't believe in killing people, but letting people get butchered is just as bad.\n \n There is some debate whether the Crusades were wanted by the Byzantines - I recall this was a big issue when I studied the 1st Crusade at uni.

It was a response to Muslim aggression. Do you not know that the Muslims took over major portions of the Holy Lands? The Christians were attempting to get them back. \n \n You say that it was mostly Orthodox Christians who were confronting the Muslims. Do you mean that the Orthodox Christians are justified in fighting them but the Catholics are not? Why are you condemning Catholic Crusades when you speak of the Orthodox mostly fighting the Muslims?\n \n Yes, Pope John Paul II makes sermons to Muslims. The Church strives for unity of all men--it is that universal. How many other Christian leaders have spoken in front of Muslims and had the opportunity to influence them? And there IS one God--doesn't the Nicene Creed that holds your core beliefs state that? The Muslims simply have a distorted view of that one God.\n \n \n4.) You also make a point for me rather well here. ROman Catholicism has a way of turning faith into politics. Christ's teaching on earthly political matters is simply give unto Ceasar what is Ceasars...not rise up and destroy your enemies...but love your enemy. \n \n Does that mean that one's faith plays no role in his politics?\n \n \nAgani...I have come to view the RCC as a social and political church more than Christ's Church. It was not always this way....it used to be Orthodox.\n\n You are right to say that the Church is a political and social Church--although it is not a political or social organization. It speaks out on social and political issues. It speaks for justice in politics and society. You see, the Catholic Church is universal enough to affect all aspects of life. Christ spoke out on political and social issues and so must His Church. We do not huddle in a corner and try to remain isolated in our own world. We are in the world, not of the world. We affect the world.\n \n Didn't you say that one of the reasons you left the Church was because the bishops wouldn't speak up and tell politicians to stop supporting abortion? Now you chastise the Church for being political?\n \n You asked me if I learned about Orthodoxy from others who are not Orthodox. Not really, I just read things. You and Monty are the only Orthodox I know except for one medical doctor in my city that I don't know very well. I must ask, did you learn about Catholicism before or after you converted and whom did you learn about it from?\n \n Did you simply look at Catholicism and criticize all the sinners in and faults of the Church, throwing your hands up in the air in resignation? Did you ever try to make real headway with positive actions to set an example or to persuade others in the right direction while you were Catholic? \n \n \nPlease read 2 Peter 3:16,17\n\n I have read it and quoted it many times. But I am not the ultimate scriptural authority--personal scriptural interpretation has limits. Any statements I make are subject to Church authority. The quoting of the verses that I did was simply to show that Jesus was not a total apathetic pacifist as some make him out to be. He acted and spoke out for right. Christians who fight in just wars do the same.\n \n One last question concerning the Nicene Creed which you say embodies the \"core Orthodox beliefs\" (dogma). It states the four marks of the Church of Christ: one, holy, Catholic, apostolic. The Orthodox Church meets the requirements of holy and apostolic. Do you think it truly meets the marks of one--is there true unity--can it affect its entire body with decisions and actions? Do you think it meets the marks of catholicity-- Does it have a strong presence universally--throughout the world?",

   "Spartacus,\n \nThe Augustinian concept of Purgatory included as Dogma\n\n \n Augustine may have shaped some of the understanding of Purgatory but there was a belief in it before he came around:\n \n The Martyrdom of Perpetua and Felicity\n \"[T]hat very night, this was shown to me in a vision: I [Perpetua] saw Dinocrates going out from a gloomy place, where also there were several others, and he was parched and very thirsty, with a filthy countenance and pallid color, and the wound on his face which he had when he died. This Dinocrates had been my brother after the flesh, seven years of age, who died miserably with disease. . . . For him I had made my prayer, and between him and me there was a large interval, so that neither of us could approach to the other . . . and [I] knew that my brother was in suffering. But I trusted that my prayer would bring help to his suffering; and I prayed for him every day until we passed over into the prison of the camp, for we were to fight in the camp-show. Then . . . I made my prayer for my brother day and night, groaning and weeping that he might be granted to me. Then, on the day on which we remained in fetters, this was shown to me: I saw that the place which I had formerly observed to be in gloom was now bright; and Dinocrates, with a clean body well clad, was finding refreshment. . . . [And] he went away from the water to play joyously, after the manner of children, and I awoke. Then I understood that he was translated from the place of punishment\" (The Martyrdom of Perpetua and Felicity 2:3-4 [A.D. 202]). \n \n Tertullian\n \"[T]hat allegory of the Lord [Matt. 5:25-26] . . . is extremely clear and simple in its meaning . . . [beware lest as] a transgressor of your agreement, before God the Judge . . . and lest this Judge deliver you over to the angel who is to execute the sentence, and he commit you to the prison of hell, out of which there will be no dismissal until the smallest even of your delinquencies be paid off in the period before the resurrection. What can be a more fitting sense than this? What a truer interpretation?\" (The Soul 35 [A.D. 210]). \n \n \"We offer sacrifices for the dead on their birthday anniversaries [the date of death-birth into eternal life]\" (The Crown 3:3 [A.D. 211]). \n \n \"A woman, after the death of her husband . . . prays for his soul and asks that he may, while waiting, find rest; and that he may share in the first resurrection. And each year, on the anniversary of his death, she offers the sacrifice\" (Monogamy 10:1-2 [A.D. 216]). \n \n Cyprian of Carthage\n \"The strength of the truly believing remains unshaken; and with those who fear and love God with their whole heart, their integrity continues steady and strong. For to adulterers even a time of repentance is granted by us, and peace [i.e., reconciliation] is given. Yet virginity is not therefore deficient in the Church, nor does the glorious design of continence languish through the sins of others. The Church, crowned with so many virgins, flourishes; and chastity and modesty preserve the tenor of their glory. Nor is the vigor of continence broken down because repentance and pardon are facilitated to the adulterer. It is one thing to stand for pardon, another thing to attain to glory; it is one thing, when cast into prison, not to go out thence until one has paid the uttermost farthing; another thing at once to receive the wages of faith and courage. It is one thing, tortured by long suffering for sins, to be cleansed and long purged by fire; another to have purged all sins by suffering. It is one thing, in fine, to be in suspense till the sentence of God at the day of judgment; another to be at once crowned by the Lord\" (Letters 51[55]:20 [A.D. 253]). \n \n Lactantius\n \"But also, when God will judge the just, it is likewise in fire that he will try them. At that time, they whose sins are uppermost, either because of their gravity or their number, will be drawn together by the fire and will be burned. Those, however, who have been imbued with full justice and maturity of virtue, will not feel that fire; for they have something of God in them which will repel and turn back the strength of the flame\" (Divine Institutes 7:21:6 [A.D. 307]). \n \n Cyril of Jerusalem\n \"Then we make mention also of those who have already fallen asleep: first, the patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, that through their prayers and supplications God would receive our petition; next, we make mention also of the holy fathers and bishops who have already fallen asleep, and, to put it simply, of all among us who have already fallen asleep, for we believe that it will be of very great benefit to the souls of those for whom the petition is carried up, while this holy and most solemn sacrifice is laid out\" (Catechetical Lectures 23:5:9 [A.D. 350]). \n \n Gregory of Nyssa\n \"If a man distinguish in himself what is peculiarly human from that which is irrational, and if he be on the watch for a life of greater urbanity for himself, in this present life he will purify himself of any evil contracted, overcoming the irrational by reason. If he has inclined to the irrational pressure of the passions, using for the passions the cooperating hide of things irrational, he may afterward in a quite different manner be very much interested in what is better, when, after his departure out of the body, he gains knowledge of the difference between virtue and vice and finds that he is not able to partake of divinity until he has been purged of the filthy contagion in his soul by the purifying fire\" (Sermon on the Dead [A.D. 382]). \n \n John Chrysostom\n \"Let us help and commemorate them. If Job's sons were purified by their father's sacrifice [Job 1:5], why would we doubt that our offerings for the dead bring them some consolation?

Let us weep for them, let us assist them to the extent of our ability, let us think of some assistance for them, small as it may be, yet let us somehow assist them. But how, and in what way? By praying for them and by entreating others to pray for them, by constantly giving alms to the poor on their behalf. Not in vain was it decreed by the apostles that in the awesome mysteries remembrance should be made of the departed. They knew that here there was much gain for them, much benefit. When the entire people stands with hands uplifted, a priestly assembly, and that awesome sacrificial Victim is laid out, how, when we are calling upon God, should we not succeed in their defense? But this is done for those who have departed in the faith, while even the catechumens are not reckoned as worthy of this consolation, but are deprived of every means of assistance except one. And what is that? We may give alms to the poor on their behalf\" (Homilies on Philippians 3:9-10 [A.D. 402]).\n \n *Fathers quotes taken from www.catholic.com\n \n Furthermore we know that Purgatory is scriptural:\n \n Here's my take on Purgatory from another debate I had with someone:\n \n If you can understand that we can take action to cooperate or to deny God then it is easier to understand Purgatory. We can also take action to intercede for others. Realize that Purgatory has little to do with salvation. All of the souls of Purgatory will get to heaven. They are all saved (1 John 5:17, not all sin is mortal that will cause the person to go to hell, yet they can't go to heaven with lesser sins due to the necessity of perfection and purity before entering heaven). In Purgatory, although souls are already saved, they must be purified because Jesus says in Mark 9:49  that \"everyone will be salted with fire.\" \n \n 1 Corinthians 3 is a good illustration of purgatory. Paul wrote, \"...I laid a foundation, and another man is building upon it. Let each man take care how he builds upon it.\" Then he speaks of the fact that \"any man's\" work will be put to the test. But there are numerous other indications in scripture of an intermediate state prior to heaven (1 Peter 3:19  shows that an intermediate state (though not Purgatory in this passage) is not only a possibility but also a reality). The doctrine of Purgatory rests on the fact that nothing unclean can enter heaven. But, wait a minute, is God asking of us something that we cannot give him? The catholic would say, no.\" The Book of Revelation in Chapter 21  states that God does not want the filth of sin in heaven for it says, \"But nothing unclean shall enter it, nor any one who practices abomination or falsehood...\" So can one enter heaven unclean in a cloak of righteousness? It seems that the uncleanness is still there but it is covered up and hidden. God does not hide things. He brings them to the light. God's goodness is pure and undefiled through and through. So too, if we are to go to heaven we must be pure and undefiled. We will be pure and good if we reach heaven as we see in Revelation. Hebrews 12:14  also speaks of this, \"Strive for peace with all men, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.\" Hebrews 12:23  tells us that the \"just men will be made perfect.\" The Gospels tell us to be perfect, as our Father is perfect.\n \n Many say that there is one mediator between God and man and that is Jesus Christ (1 Timothy 2:5). However, if you look at the first line of chapter 2 of 1 Timothy-a few lines above the mediator quote, you read, \"First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be made for all men...This is good, and it is acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour...\" Why does Paul ask that we pray and make supplication for others if Jesus' work is finished? Jesus' work is once and for all but also perpetual and on going since the time of the crucifixion. It is outside of the boundary of time and is eternal. But what good will our prayers do if Jesus' mediation excludes our intercession and action? Jesus is the primary mediator but others can intercede (Colossians 1:24, 1 Corinthians 3:9). This is the basis for Catholics praying for the intercession of Mary and the Saints. This is the basis for Catholics praying for the souls in purgatory. We pray for others to intercede and pray for us through Jesus. And it is readily evident that the prayers of the saints and of righteous men have power (Romans 15:30, Ephesians 6:18-19, James 5:16, Revelation 5:8, Revelation 8:3-4) Pay close attention to the quotes from Revelation 5 and 8 if you think praying to saints is lacking understanding of the mediator!\n \n Consider also that Paul prays for his dead friend Onesiphorus in 2 Timothy 1:16-18. Why does Paul pray for a dead man if he is already in heaven? No prayers can help him if he is in hell because it is eternal. The Old Testament scripture that foreshadows the New Testament Purgatory is evident. It has been deleted from your protestant Bibles by Martin Luther because it did not gel with his theories though. Look up 2 Maccabees 12: 44-46  to see that the sins of the dead can be atoned. Jesus himself alludes to this in Matthew 12:32  when he speaks of forgiveness in this age or the next. And he again alludes to this in Matthew 5:26 and 12:36.\n \n The word Purgatory is not in scripture. This is just a name given to the intermediate state by the Church. When you consider this, remember also that the word Trinity and Incarnation cannot be found in scripture. Yet many Christians have no trouble in believing in either of these doctrines.",

   "Spartacus,\n \n \n Augustine may have shaped some of the understanding of Purgatory but there was a belief in it before he came around:\n \n The Martyrdom of Perpetua and Felicity\n \"[T]hat very night, this was shown to me in a vision: I [Perpetua] saw Dinocrates going out from a gloomy place, where also there were several others, and he was parched and very thirsty, with a filthy countenance and pallid color, and the wound on his face which he had when he died. This Dinocrates had been my brother after the flesh, seven years of age, who died miserably with disease. . . . For him I had made my prayer, and between him and me there was a large interval, so that neither of us could approach to the other . . . and [I] knew that my brother was in suffering. But I trusted that my prayer would bring help to his suffering; and I prayed for him every day until we passed over into the prison of the camp, for we were to fight in the camp-show. Then . . . I made my prayer for my brother day and night, groaning and weeping that he might be granted to me. Then, on the day on which we remained in fetters, this was shown to me: I saw that the place which I had formerly observed to be in gloom was now bright; and Dinocrates, with a clean body well clad, was finding refreshment. . . . [And] he went away from the water to play joyously, after the manner of children, and I awoke. Then I understood that he was translated from the place of punishment\" (The Martyrdom of Perpetua and Felicity 2:3-4 [A.D. 202]). \n \n Tertullian\n \"[T]hat allegory of the Lord [Matt. 5:25-26] . . . is extremely clear and simple in its meaning . . . [beware lest as] a transgressor of your agreement, before God the Judge . . . and lest this Judge deliver you over to the angel who is to execute the sentence, and he commit you to the prison of hell, out of which there will be no dismissal until the smallest even of your delinquencies be paid off in the period before the resurrection. What can be a more fitting sense than this? What a truer interpretation?\" (The Soul 35 [A.D. 210]). \n \n \"We offer sacrifices for the dead on their birthday anniversaries [the date of death-birth into eternal life]\" (The Crown 3:3 [A.D. 211]). \n \n \"A woman, after the death of her husband . . . prays for his soul and asks that he may, while waiting, find rest; and that he may share in the first resurrection. And each year, on the anniversary of his death, she offers the sacrifice\" (Monogamy 10:1-2 [A.D. 216]). \n \n Cyprian of Carthage\n \"The strength of the truly believing remains unshaken; and with those who fear and love God with their whole heart, their integrity continues steady and strong. For to adulterers even a time of repentance is granted by us, and peace [i.e., reconciliation] is given. Yet virginity is not therefore deficient in the Church, nor does the glorious design of continence languish through the sins of others. The Church, crowned with so many virgins, flourishes; and chastity and modesty preserve the tenor of their glory. Nor is the vigor of continence broken down because repentance and pardon are facilitated to the adulterer. It is one thing to stand for pardon, another thing to attain to glory; it is one thing, when cast into prison, not to go out thence until one has paid the uttermost farthing; another thing at once to receive the wages of faith and courage. It is one thing, tortured by long suffering for sins, to be cleansed and long purged by fire; another to have purged all sins by suffering. It is one thing, in fine, to be in suspense till the sentence of God at the day of judgment; another to be at once crowned by the Lord\" (Letters 51[55]:20 [A.D. 253]). \n \n Lactantius\n \"But also, when God will judge the just, it is likewise in fire that he will try them.

Those earliest Christians who were closer to the apostle's teaching in time than we today?\n\n \n \n\n Why do you pray for the dead, by the way??\n\n \n One of the mysteries shared by both our Churches is the belief of what Christ did between His burial and resurrection.\n \n 1 Peter 3:19  by whom He went and preached to spirits in prison, 20 who formerly disobediant when once the longsuffering waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is eight, righteous were saved through water.\n \n In the time between His burial and Resurrection Christ descended to Hades (spirits in prison) so that light might shine on them and that He might deliver them from death (spiritual death in Hades). \n \n Hades(GR) and Sheol (HEB)are both words used to describe the place where souls were deposited awaiting the Resurrection of Christ. By His crucifiction and descent Christ destroyed these. Releasing souls so that they might have eternal life. Both Hades and Sheol are often interpretted as \"Hell\" in English Language Bibles.\n \n \"But Christ mentions Hell and Hellfire?\"\n \n Actually the word used by Christ often interpretted as \"Hell\" or \"Hellfire\" is in fact \"Gahenna\" -- an infamous and ancient Garbage heap outside Jerusalum.\n \n As far as purifictaion and nothing not purified entering the Kingdom of Hevaen. Fire was and still is often used to purify things. That does not neccessarily denote the visions of \"Hades\" people often have when they think of being purified by fire. The Holy SPirit appeared as tongues of fir on the Pentecost. Did this purifying fire harm or help the Apostles? \n \n Christ is the ultimate Judge of all of us -- not the Pope or the Roman Cardianls -- as such \"Why do we pray for the dead?\". We pray to God to have mercy on them...and us too for that matter. As Orthodox we see no need to codify this belief, quantify it or claim to know how God will Judge us through the teaching of \"Indulgences\" or anything.\n \n To codify and quantify the Christian practice and hope of praying God have mercy on the departed and on us as well...and then to require such a belief...to Orthodox just seems \"superfluous\" and bourne more in the teachings of man that those of Christ through His Apostles.",

Paul tells us to pray for others (Rom 15:30, Col 4:3, 1 Thess 5:25, 2 Thess 3:1, Eph 6:18,19, 1 Tim 2:1-7).

   "Spartacus,\n RE: Indulgences from a previous post--my response from a previous thread to another poster\n \n Firstly, indulgences were not for sell (Canon 2327 excommunicates anyone who seeks material profit from indulgences). Secondly, indulgences did not grant forgiveness. An indulgence is the remission of the debt of temporal punishment (not the eternal punishment) due to sin after its guilt has been forgiven. It is the remission of sentence of penalty and not a commutation of the sentence or penalty. The remission of debt is not the remission of guilt. An indulgence has nothing to do with the guilt of the sin. In fact, an indulgence can only be gained by one who is not in a state of sin; one who has secured forgiveness of his sins by repentance and Confession. This does nothing to detract from the eternal salvation bought for us by Christ on the cross. Even after Christ's sacrifice, we are not exempt from suffering. \n \n Scriptural foundations for indulgences can be found in Matthew 16:19, \"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\" Jesus gave the Church the power to bind and loose, including the penalty for sin. This is the power the Church uses in granting indulgences. Paul gives us an example of remitting temporal punishment due to sin (as an indulgence does) in 2 Corinthians 2: 6-10  when he allows the man found guilty of sinning with his stepmother (1 Corinthians 5:1) back in to the church after learning of his repentance. There are many more examples in scripture where works can offset the consequences of sin (James 5:20  and 1 Peter 4:8 as well as many Old Testament verses)\n \n Indulgences can also be illustrated with a practical example. Suppose a boy throws a rock through the window of a store to win a bet with his friend (a sin). The boy feels badly after throwing the rock and confesses to the crime with an immediate apology (contrition and confession). The store manager knows the boy and he talks to the owner of the store about the incident. The owner gives the manager the permission to decide whether or not formal charges for vandalism will be pressed. The manager elects not to press charges for the indiscretion (forgiveness). However, he still has a broken window to repair (consequence of sin). He decides to let the boy work off the debt at the store by sweeping for 5 days. The boy comes in every day for 4 days on time. The boy has a very good attitude during his work. He actually helps the storeowner stock shelves and cleans out the freezer without the storeowner requiring it of him (good works/penance). Because the boy has shown a change of heart and reformed his ways the store manager cancels the debt of the remaining day (an indulgence). In effect the boy gets time off for good behavior. This does not change the fact that the boy sinned, nor is the sin abolished. Rather, the good works lessen the penalty of that sin. \n \n I acknowledge that there were abuses concerning indulgences in the time of Luther but the Church never sanctioned this. Indulgences were granted to those who would give alms towards the building of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. These people gave alms for a good work. Just as Christ gave a special blessing to the widow who gave her mite as an alm to the temple in Jerusalem, indulgences were granted to those who gave alms for St. Peter's.\n \n (Also, you mentioned something about Catholic belief in Limbo. Be aware that Limbo is not a doctrine of the Catholic Church. Limbo was a theological concept by which theologians speculated on the fate or state of non-baptized babies that died. \n \n And Catholics DO fast before receiving Communion).",

The Pope said he'd give help only on condition that they over-turn all objections to Catholicism, including that they had to recognise the Pope as leader. Those at the conference readily agreed to everything, providing that they got help. On return to Constantinople the delegates were condemned for all the concessions they gave.

With the abundance of other scriptural points of reference to Peter's primacy this granting to the other apostles takes nothing away.

You are saying not that you are 'devoted' to Mary, but to the co-redemptress, Mary. Unless you've already accepted her as this. And this is where your argument about 'dogma defined' falls down. Currently the co-redemptress issue IS NOT dogma, because it has not been stated at any council, however if it does become dogma, then you might be able to retrospectively add as 'evidence' the fact that people consider her co-redemptress, now. But that is not the same as saying that on 12/10/2004 Catholic dogma considered her a co-redemptress. Thus, papal infallibility did not become dogma, till defined. And that was in the 1870s.\n \nI have one Catholic neighbour, and one Catholic work-mate who both have told me that I am going to hell by the fact that I once was a Catholic, and am one no more. \n\n \nYou could, in fact, go to hell (so could I).

The Church teaches this: if you know and truly understand the Catholic Church as the fullness of truth of Christ's teaching and turn away from it or refuse to enter in communion with it then it is a mortal sin worthy of hell. It is not so much that you are turning away from a church as that you are turning away from Christ (and his Church).\n\n Yes, and that's why they can say I'm going to hell\n \n The Acacian Schism\n The Acacian Schism is another thing plucked out of the context of history and given as proof of papal power.\n The Emperor imposed upon the eastern churches an oath at behest of the Pope. He was playing politics. He was doing this at a time he needed help. 15 years earlier, he had been in a different position, and had ordered Pope Vigilius to Constantinople, and placed him under arrest for 10 years. This later incident is not noted by Catholics for it shows not the supremacy of the Pope, but the supremacy of the Emperor, who forced his will on the eastern church when he needed to, and on the western church likewise. The Emperor already had control over the east, and could more easily control affairs there.\n Thus...\n \"The Emperors considered the Pope to be their subject as well as the Patriarch; and the Pope was more important because he was physically less easy to control and politically more useful owing to the influence he commanded in Italy (which Justinian was trying to regain). Thus if the Pope could only be placated by humiliating the Patriarch, the Emperor was usually prepared to order the patriarch to recognise papal superiority...\" Sir Steven Runciman, \"The Eastern Schism: A Study of the Papacy and the Eastern Churches during the XIth and XII Centuries,\" pp17-18\n quoted in\n Whelton, M (1998) \"Two Paths: Papal Monarch Collegial Tradition\", p82\n Likewise... \"But the fear of compromising the autonomy of their churches prevented the Orientals from accepting the claims that were made by certain Popes, especially Gelasius, Symmacus and Nicholas I, the claim to direct and immediate jurisdiction over the whole church, including the east.\"\n Francis Dvornik, *Byzantium and the Roman Primacy, p165\n Roman Catholic scholar at Harvard University.\n quoted in Whelton, M (1998) \"Two Paths: Papal Monarch Collegial Tradition\", p83\n \n The oath was \"In following all these things the apostolic see and in professing all its constitutions, I hope that I will deserve to remain in the same communion with you which is professed by the apostolic see, in which persists the total and true strength of the Christian religion. Promising also not to recite in the liturgy the names of men who have been separated from communion with the Catholic Church which means, who do not agree with the apostolic see....\"\n Cambridge Medieval History - vol 2, pp246-247\n quoted in Whelton, M (1998) \"Two Paths: Papal Monarch Collegial Tradition\", p81\n HOWEVER\n \"Before signing the document, John, Patriarch of Constantinople, added the following sentence: \"I hold the most holy Church of the old and the new Rome to be one. I define the see of the Apostle Peter and this of the imperial city to be the one see.\" In doing this, he was recalling the fact that canon 28 of the Council of Constantinople declared that the Sees of Roman and Constantinople were equal.\"\n Whelton, M (1998) \"Two Paths: Papal Monarch Collegial Tradition\", pp81-82\n \n AND, the admission of any Patriarch to any one thing does not make it Orthodox, because we don't believe in the infallibility of individuals, but of the church as a whole, and doctrine is only defined by the church as a whole. So, even if Justinian effectively points a gun (or a sword) to his head, and makes him say anything, that does not validate papal claims.",

   "Do you have references to which parts of the Councils?\n It's not dogma, by the very meaning of the term, until it is defined. It wasn't defined until Vatican I. I stated that John XXII denied papal infallibility, he did so in the 1300's, twice in a Bull Extravagantes (March 1322) and In another Bull; Quia Quorundam, November 1324.\n\n I don't have references but I will try to find the time to look for them. Obviously something is not dogma until defined but that does not mean there is no basis at all for it in the Revelation of Jesus. I can't find a Bull Extravagantes do you have a link?\n \n \nWhat do you mean by 'participation'? Schism had already split Catholicism from Orthodoxy. A presence at the council is not akin to active participation.\n You must also know that those Orthodox 'participating' at the Council of Florence, were condemned on their return. Do you know the historical context? In the mid-1400's Constantinople was being attacked by the Turks. They turned to the west for help. The Pope said he'd give help only on condition that they over-turn all objections to Catholicism, including that they had to recognise the Pope as leader. Those at the conference readily agreed to everything, providing that they got help. On return to Constantinople the delegates were condemned for all the concessions they gave. There were cries \"Better Turk, than Roman\", and so we went it alone, and the Turks won, but we kept our Orthodox church. It does you no justice in making reference to such things without due consideration of what actually went on.\n\n No, I did not know the historical context. Thanks for the information. I will have to study this.\n \n \nAbortion was considered a sin by the first Christians. What development do you mean?\n\n I was arguing on the basis of Spartacus' logic seeming to state that Purgatory is not named in Scripture so it is an addition to the Revelation of Christ. I do believe there is a scriptural basis condemning abortion and have argued this previously--although I do not believe there is an explicit and outright scriptural condemnation. \n \n \nIt doesn't matter at all, or you're arguing what against what Jesus showed in his parables; viz. the vine-yard workers who are employed at various times in the day, and yet are all paid the same. And, all the Apostles were give the same payment.\n\n The vine-yard workers may all receive the same payment when they reach heaven but they did not all have the same power here on earth. Peter will receive the same payment but he was a CEO not simply senior level management.\n \n \nI think stating that there's an 'abundance of scripture' is a 'just-so' statement.\n I draw your attention to post #3 for a context of the Bible.\n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=3265\n\n I did not simply say that there was a lot of scripture about Peter. I stated there was a lot and told why it points to his primacy in the previous post on Peter the Rock.\n \n \nI think this is not the argument you wished to make. You are saying not that you are 'devoted' to Mary, but to the co-redemptress, Mary. Unless you've already accepted her as this. And this is where your argument about 'dogma defined' falls down. Currently the co-redemptress issue IS NOT dogma, because it has not been stated at any council, however if it does become dogma, then you might be able to retrospectively add as 'evidence' the fact that people consider her co-redemptress, now. But that is not the same as saying that on 12/10/2004 Catholic dogma considered her a co-redemptress. Thus, papal infallibility did not become dogma, till defined. And that was in the 1870s.\n\n Dogma does not become dogma until defined but that does not mean that there is not a basis for that dogma in the Revelation of Jesus. This does not mean that there is no history of the dogma defined until its definition.\n \n \nYes, and that's why they can say I'm going to hell\n\n 1. So you believe you fully understand Catholic teaching? and\n 2. You reject it?\n \n \nThe Acacian Schism\n The Acacian Schism is another thing plucked out of the context of history and given as proof of papal power.\n The Emperor imposed upon the eastern churches an oath at behest of the Pope. He was playing politics. He was doing this at a time he needed help. 15 years earlier, he had been in a different position, and had ordered Pope Vigilius to Constantinople, and placed him under arrest for 10 years. This later incident is not noted by Catholics for it shows not the supremacy of the Pope, but the supremacy of the Emperor, who forced his will on the eastern church when he needed to, and on the western church likewise. The Emperor already had control over the east, and could more easily control affairs there.\n Thus...\n\n Are you saying that the pope's imprisonment is not usually mentioned by Catholics?",

It was taught by them. It was dogma... in that it was taught as truth. \n\n \n It was not created in the 1870s the quotes from the councils I supplied attest to that.\n\n Frankly, I don't believe your selective sourcing.\n \nYou will be hard pressed to find the early church teaching that St.Peter's one particular See was supreme. \n\n \nNo, I will not. I have supplied quotes from the Fathers to support this many times. But we have gone round and round on it so much I'm not sure why we continue--both hard-headed!\n\n Again, your sources have been highly selective, some have been out-right misleading.\n See post #5 of \"The Papacy\" thread, where in I give a claim, and its real context.\n Most of your quotes about 'the Papacy' deal with things such as 'to the head of the Church of the Romans\". Which is not a call for the head of the church in Rome to be the head of the other churches, such as the head of the church of the Asians.\n \nHowever, I will concede that I need re-define my own definition of dogma because the dogma of the Trinity has been re-stated, but that's different from having never been taught previously. \n\n \nNone of the Catholic dogmas are any different in their fulfillment and declaration than the dogma of the Trinity.\n\n You changed the relationship of the Trinity, with the addition of the filioque, which again previous Popes had argued against.\n \nBut that still leads us to the point where you should condemn me to hell... because I openly reject Catholicism, and I was Catholic. \n\n \nNo it doesn't. I have no power to condemn anyone to hell. I have no power to know if you truly understand Catholicism. \n\n Your church condemns me.\n \nIf you disagree with me then that is probably proof that you do not understand it. You see, I am always right! \n\n :) A novel argument\n \nI believe it does. The incident doesn't show the Pope in charge, it shows the Emperor in charge. At best it would be an argument of Papal supremacy, not infallibility, and as I stated, in the context of both incidents, it doesn't show anything than the Emperor pushing one person when he needed to, then another. \n\n \nI do not think the Emperor's use of force to imprison a pope disproves anything about the papacy or the Church. The emperor is not a deacon, priest, bishop, or pope.\n\n I believe it does. It shows that the Emperor had power over the Pope by the fact the Pope was actually in the Emperor's power.\n \nAgain these arguments are better suited to a 'papal supremacy' argument, not a 'papal infallibility argument.\n You've still yet to show this... by mixing up two similar arguments;\n Papal Supremacy\n Papal Infallibility. \n\n \nNo they are not because of the words written at the council--that the faith had been kept unsullied by the Apostolic See of Rome. These words show ideas of papal infallibility in the Roman Church prior to 1870 whether the Orthodox agreed with it or not.\n\n I disagree, many of your incidents are arguments for papal supremecy.",

But he never denied Papal Infallibility.\"\n\n That is what happened, but your conclusions are different. Whelton (quoted in previous post) states how a decision was made regarding a religious order. John XXII wanted to change that decision. The religious order claimed he couldn't, because what was set by a previous pope was 'infallible in the sense that it ruled by one pope, and therefore set in stone. John XXII argued against being bound by a previous Pope's ruling; he thus put a case against infallibility, in that he argued that he could in fact go against what a previous pope had said. Where it differs is that what the previous pope said, wasn't claimed by that pope to be infallible, but by the religious order. To quote Whelton, who quotes Tierney, John XXII called it a \"pernicious novelty\", and in 1324 \"...proclaim(ed) irreformabilty as a pernicious audacity...\" (Whelton, p129)\n That \"...the Franciscans leaders defended this cherished papal Bull on the grounds that it was irreformable and its very 'irreformability' logically presupposed Papal Infallibility.\" (Whelton, p128)\n [quote=Montalban] Again, I don't think that this is the argument you want to make.

Prior to the schism many in \"Orthodox\" or Eastern churches made affirmative statements on papal supremacy. I have quoted these.\n\n a) individual Orthodox making statements does not equate to Orthodox doctrine\n b) Catholic quotes of such matters are themselves highly dubious.\n See a sampler from \"The Papacy\" Post #2\n Catholics make much use of the words of these councils. One of the main Catholic 'evidences' comes from the belief that Cyril, Bishop of Alexandria acted as the Pope's (Celestine) servant, in the Nestorian debates. Pope Pius XI claimed that the 3rd Ecumenical Council established papal supremacy.\n \"But Cyril said... \"Peter and John were both Apostles and saints and adorned with equal honours and powers\" (P G Migne, 76:65).[i] In fact, specifically in this debate, Pope Celestine held a synod in Rome in which he condemned Nestorius. He then wrote to Cyril informing him of this decision. Importantly, Cyril convened a council in Alexandria to discuss the issues raised in the Pope's letter, and they too condemned Nestorius. This is important, because even though the Pope had ruled on this, and had informed Cyril, Cyril did not just 'obey', but instead called a council of those in his own See. This was because as Cyril understood it, he was the boss of his own area. What was ruled in Rome did not affect him.\n Catholics continue to re-write Council teachings\n \"Third Ecumenical Council: Ephesus (431) The Council of Ephesus, of more than 200 bishops, presided over by St. Cyril of Alexandria representing Pope Celestine I, defined the true personal unity of Christ, declared Mary the Mother of God (theotokos) against Nestorius, Bishop of Constantinople, and renewed the condemnation\n of Pelagius.\"[ii]\n This falsehood stems from Pius XI's declaration (in Lux Veritatis) that Cyril, Patriarch of Alexandria was a papal legate. Pope Celestine never refers to Patriarch Cyril as legate in correspondence to the Council, and only describes Arcadius, Projetus, and Philip as those who \"filled the place of the Apostolic See\". (Mansi - VI, 1337).[iii] \n The fact that the Pope sent these legates at all shows that Cyril did not represent him, or else the Pope would not have sent them as his representatives. Three months before the Council had been called, Pope Celestine had issued an excommunication on Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople. The Council, however, ignored this and treated Nestorius as the proper Patriarch of Constantinople. The council then proceeded to examine the evidence and pronounced its own sentence: \"The holy Synod...to Nestorius the new Judas: Know that for thy impious doctrines thou was deposed by the holy Synod agreeably to the laws of the Church.\"\n (Mansi -IV, 1227).[iv]\n That is, they ignored the excommunication of Celestine and judged him for themselves. Pope Pius XI tried to put a spin on this saying that they merely ratified Celestine's sentence. This is not so, as shown Nestorius was accepted with honour, until the sentence was passed. The Emperor himself had invited Nestorius \"...In November the emperor, not regarding the papal condemnation as definitive, had already convoked a general council...\" \n (Leo Donald Davis (a Jesuit) \"The First Seven Ecumenical Councils (325-787) Their History and Theology\", Liturgical Press, Minnesota, 1990, p153).[v]\n Further, Roman Catholic historian Bishop Maret says \"The Pope pronounced in the affair of Nestorius a canonical judgment clothed with all the authority of his see. He had prescribed its execution. Yet, however, three months after this sentence and before its execution, all the episcopate is invited to examine afresh and to decide freely the question in dispute...\" (Du Concile generale et de la paix religieuse - vol1, page 183, Bishop Henri Maret Paris, 1869).

I have in great detail met many quotes and shown them to be false. If Catholics continue to say \"Here's the list, it just proves our case\", it is possible many will just accept it, based on the fact that Catholic sites pronounce as exemplar such a list. However one would have to wonder why, on closer inspection (when some are found fraudulent) that the Catholic church would use such fraud - it is akin to the \"Donation of Constantine\" fraud.\n \nAfter the schism no Orthodox consented to papal authority (as you informed me when I quoted the councils and gave me historical context) so that they remained Orthodox and not Catholic.\n\n Actually I mis-stated this. Some Orthodox have, as individuals become Catholic. It would be impossible to say otherwise. However, yes, as a Church we have never accepted Papal Supremacy.\n \nObviously I'm going to have to set this record straight by actually re-quoting the words (references to past posts hasn't worked)...\n Post # 3 of \"The Papacy\"\n APPENDIX B \"The Council of Jerusalem\" as shown by Acts of the Apostles\n There are a few important things to note about this council.\n a) James presided, not Peter, because Jerusalem was then the most important Christian centre.\n b) When someone spoke, whomever it was, no one else spoke over them.\n That's called politeness\n Thus...\n \"When they finished, James spoke up:...\"\n That is, James waited his turn.\n Earlier...\n Acts 15:12\n \"The whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul telling about the miraculous signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them. \" They too had the floor, and everyone was silent.\n c) MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL James clearly made the decision\n Acts 15:19\n \"It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God.\n Note also...\n Acts 15:23\n \"With them they sent the following letter: The apostles and elders, your brothers, To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia:\n Greetings.\n 24 We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said.\n 25 So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul-- 26 men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ That is, 'we' decided this, 'we' voted on this.

St. James made a judgement, and they followed it.\n\n \nJames affirmed Peter's decision.\n\n I think this is really trying too hard.\n If St. Peter says something, and they agree, you take this to be affirmation of leadership. If someone else says something, and they all agree... you are silent. I have shown the discussions made by them all. Peter speaks, everyone listens (for you; affirmation of supremacy). St. Paul speaks with his mate, everyone else is silent (you ignore this). St. James presided (you somehow think makes St. Peter supreme (???)). They took turns. St. Paul rebuked St. Peter (you ignore) Where you apply a rule is not based on 'evidence', but of the assumption you've already made.\n St.Augustine stated\n \"He had not the primacy over the disciples (in discipulos) but among the disciples (in discipulis). His primacy among the disciples was the same as that of Stephen among the deacons\". -St. Augustine, Sermon 10 on Peter and Paul.\n \"But observe how Peter does everything with the common consent; nothing imperiously.\" - St. John Chrysostomon, Homily III on Acts 1:12\n (Whelton, p33) (for this last one also see http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-11/npnf1-11-10.htm#P272_117779)\n \nFrankly, I don't believe your selective sourcing. Again, your sources have been highly selective, some have been out-right misleading.\n See post #5 of \"The Papacy\" thread, where in I give a claim, and its real context.\n Most of your quotes about 'the Papacy' deal with things such as 'to the head of the Church of the Romans\". Which is not a call for the head of the church in Rome to be the head of the other churches, such as the head of the church of the Asians. \n\n \nMany of my quotes are unequivocal in establishing that the person was speaking of supremacy over the entire church.\n\n You claim this, again. Unfortunately, you give a certain amount of quotes. Of these, only some I can actually check by independent sources, and most are not how you make them. Which leads me to conclude that the sites you cite are dishonest, or making an attempt to justify something without really researching it. I have already gone over this\n For example...\n A catholic claim you and various sites state...\n \"After the reading of the foregoing epistle [The Tome of Leo], the most reverend bishops cried out: 'This is the faith of the fathers! This is the faith of the apostles! So we all believe! Thus the orthodox believe! Anathema to him who does not thus believe! Peter has spoken thus through Leo!\" (ibid., session 2).[xvii]\n This same Leo, it must be remembered, begged the Emperor to have the council meet in Italy, but the Emperor ignored him?\n \"And because this mystery is now being impiously opposed by a few ignorant persons, all the churches of our parts, and all the priests entreat your clemency, with groans and tears seeing that our delegates faithfully protested, and bishop Flavian gave them an appeal in writing, to order a general synod to be held in Italy, which shall either dismiss or appease all disputes in such a way that there be nothing any longer either doubtful in the Faith or divided in love, and to it, of course, the bishops of the Eastern provinces must come, and if any of them were overcome by threats and injury, and deviated from the path of truth, they may be fully restored by health-giving measures, and they themselves, whose case is harder, if they acquiesce in wiser counsels, may not fall from the unity of the Church.\" Letter XLIV. To Theodosius Augustus.[xviii]\n But what about the actual text as put forward by the Catholics? Well let's look at the text and how it reads in context \"After reading of the forgoing epistle (Pope Leo's), the most reverend bishops cried out: \"This is the faith of the fathers, this is the faith of the Apostles. So we all believe, thus the orthodox believe. Anathema to him who does not thus believe. Peter has spoken thus through Leo. So taught the Apostles. Piously and truly did Leo teach, so taught Cyril. Everlasting be the memory of Cyril. Leo and Cyril taught the same thing, anathema to him who does not so believe. This is the true faith. Those of us who are orthodox thus believe.\" (quoted in Two Paths, p64).\n That is, they welcome the teachings of Leo, because they are the truth, as are the teachings of Cyril. They are not saying 'these are the teachings of our leader', otherwise they wouldn't have put Cyril on the same footing as Leo.\n [xvii] http://www.catholic.com/library/Aut...Pope_Part_2.asp\n [xviii] http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-...tm#P1334_326773\n [xix] http://www.ccel.org/fathers/NPNF2-1...edon/canons.htm\n This is but one example, but on testing it, it fails to support the claim. All you do now is re-state that you've listed such claims. It is a 'just-so' statement, repeated. When it is possible to test the evidence, it fails.\n \nYour church condemns me. \n\n \nYou condemn yourself. The Church makes no judgement on if you truly and fully understand its teachings. That will have to come on the Last Day.\n\n No, your church claims I am condemned, even if by my own hand. You just repeat it here. It has made a decision that because I have rejected Catholicism, I am doomed, you made the announcement here \"Montalban is condemned (even if by his own hand).\" My church makes no such claim (that I am aware of). Yours does. Your church has pronounced that I am condemned.\n \nI believe it does. It shows that the Emperor had power over the Pope by the fact the Pope was actually in the Emperor's power.\n\n \nThis shows no power in the ecclesiastical setting.\n\n The Emperor was not excommunicated for imprisoning the Pope. So, I suppose you're going to say that has nothing to do with church matters - that the Pope was imprisoned?",

   "As to false claims, I've already retorted, but seems I must do so again. (the body of this text I gave on the thread \"The Papacy\"). It is a shame that Maximus continues a 'just-so' argument that he's posted 'evidence' somewhere else.\n Catholics list quotes (such as to be found at http://www.globalserve.net/~bumblebee/ecclesia/patriarchs.htm) wherein they claim Orthodox supported Papal claims to power. I wrote to this particular site and stated....\n Sir,\n I am amazed at the lack of critical thinking that was shown in posting these quotes. Many clearly don't support the case of Papal Primacy. For instance...\n Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus in Syria (450): \n A native of Antioch, Theodoret ruled under the Antiochean Patriarch.\n The great foundation of the Church was shaken, and confirmed by the Divine grace. And the Lord commanded him to apply that same care to the brethren. 'And thou,' He says, 'converted, confirm thy brethren.' (Theodoret, Tom. iv. Haeret. Fab. lib. v.c. 28)\n Is taken so much out of context that it has no mention of St. Peter, or of Rome, or anything, and is thus bereft of meaning for the purposes of your argument.\n Another quote...\n St. Athanasius (362 A.D.): \n Rome is called the Apostolic throne. (Athanasius, Hist. Arian, ad Monach. n. 35).\n This doesn't support your case, because many 'thrones' were Apostolic. Antioch was founded by St. Peter too, and was in fact founded before the Roman See, thus it can claim the same 'Apostolic' status.\n Where does it say that St. Peter, as the head of the Apostles should be succeeded by a ruler, in only one of the bishoprics that he founded - in particular, Rome? Thus, even when you can show that St. Peter did lead the Apostles, you need to draw a connection between this and the bishops of only one particular see that he founded.\n Likewise, another (mis)quote of yours...\n St. Cyril of Alexandria (c. 424): \n He suffers him no longer to be called Simon, exercising authority and rule over him already having become His own. By a title suitable to the thing, He changed his name into Peter, from the word 'petra' (rock); for on him He was afterwards to found His Church. (Cyril, T. iv. Comm. in Joan., p. 131)\n The very basis for claims of Papal Authority stem from the New Testament passage: ?Thou art Peter; and on this rock I will build My church? and I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.? (Mat 16:18-19).\n But, how did the early church view this passage? Is the Catholic claim so clear-cut? A survey of early church fathers commentaries 1 shows seventeen Fathers thought of the rock as Peter, forty-four thought it referred to Peter's confession of faith, sixteen thought Christ himself was the rock, while eight thought that the rock meant all of the Apostles. Thus 80% of these Church Fathers did not recognise ?the rock? as meaning Peter alone. Such a claim of Catholic commission therefore is not so clear.\n St. Augustine of Hippo wrote 2 \"See what praises follow this faith. \"Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build this Church\" What meaneth, \"Upon this rock I will build My Church\"?\n Upon this faith; upon this that has been said, \"Thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God. Upon this rock,\" saith He, \"I will build My Church.\"\n St. Cyprian stated 3 \"Faith is the foundation of the Church, for it was not of the person but of the faith of St. Peter that it was said that the gates of hell should not prevail against it; it sis the confession of faith that has vanquished hell. Jesus Christ is the Rock. He did not deny the grace of His name when He called him Peter, because he borrowed from the rock the constancy and solidity of his faith. Endeavour then, thyself to be a rock ? thy rock is thy faith, and faith is the foundation of the Church. If thou art a rock, thou shalt be in the Church for the Church is built upon the rock\"?\n Thus, St. Cyprian, the very bloke you quote understands that it is the faith as declared by St. Peter to be the basis for the church. Not the person of St. Peter.\n Turning again to St. Augustine 4 \"Therefore Peter is so called from the rock; not the rock from Peter; as Christ is not called Christ from the Christian, but the Christian from Christ. \" Therefore, \"He saith, \"Thou art Peter; and upon this Rock\" which thou hast confessed, upon this Rock which thou hast acknowledged saying, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God, will I build My Church:\" that is upon Myself, the Son of the living God, \"will I build My Church.\" I will build thee upon Myself, not Myself upon thee. For men who wish to be built upon men, said, ?I am of Paul: and I of Appollos; and I of Cephas,\" (1 Cor. 1:12) who is Peter, but upon the Rock, said \"But I am of Christ.\n And when the Apostle Paul ascertained that he was chose, and Christ despised, he said, \"Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?\" (1 Cor. 1:13) And, as not in the name of Paul, so neither in the name of Peter; but in the name of Christ: that Peter might be built upon the Rock, not the Rock upon Peter.?\n \n Your quote...\n Eulogius of Alexandria (581 A.D.):\n Neither to John, nor to any other of the disciples, did our Saviour say, 'I will give to thee the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,' but only to Peter. (Eulogius, Lib. ii. Cont. Novatian. ap. Photium, Biblioth, cod. 280)\n \n Doesn't add that further to this, the power of binding and loosing is given to all the Apostles (Mat 18:18). Thus to turn to St. Augustine once more 5 ?He had not the primacy over the disciples (in discipulos) but among the disciples (in disipulis). His primacy among the disciples was the same as that of Stephen among the deacons?\n \n Other 'sources' you quote, I can't check. I try the meta search-engine Ithaki.net I type \"Sergius, Metropolitain of Cyprus\" in the search-engine only reveals your own web-site (and other sites mirroring the same set of quotes). However, I would be safe to assume that you liberally misquote them as well.\n \n One of the worst quotes you use is \n St. Sophronius, Patriarch of Jerusalem (c. 638): \n Teaching us all orthodoxy and destroying all heresy and driving it away from the God-protected halls of our holy Catholic Church. And together with these inspired syllables and characters, I accept all his (the pope's) letters and teachings as proceeding from the mouth of Peter the Coryphaeus, and I kiss them and salute them and embrace them with all my soul ... I recognize the latter as definitions of Peter and the former as those of Mark, and besides, all the heaven-taught teachings of all the chosen mystagogues of our Catholic Church. (Sophronius, Mansi, xi. 461)\n \n Note that he accepts teachings of St. Peter and St. Mark. He embraces both with 'all his soul', as I do, as we all should - embrace the teachings of all the Apostles. You seem to think that this is proof of only St. Peter's greatness, and I don't see why you would draw such an inference especially when mentioned in context with another Apostle.\n \n One of the main Catholic 'evidences' comes from the belief that Cyril, Bishop of Alexandria acted as the Pope's (Celestine) servant, in the Nestorian debates. Pope Pius XI claimed that the 3rd Ecumenical Council established papal supremacy.\n But Cyril said...\n \"Peter and John were both Apostles and saints and adorned with equal honours and powers\"6\n \n The Pretence of Popes goes back a long way, so it is no surprise that it would be based on misquotes and misrepresentations....\n \n Third Ecumenical Council: Ephesus (431) \n The Council of Ephesus, of more than 200 bishops, presided over by St. Cyril of Alexandria representing Pope Celestine I, defined the true personal unity of Christ, declared Mary the Mother of God (theotokos) against Nestorius, Bishop of Constantinople, and renewed the condemnation of Pelagius.7\n \n This lie stems from Pius XI's declaration (in Lux Veritatis) that Cyril, Patriarch of Alexandria was a papal legate.\n \n Pope Celestine never refers to Patriarch Cyril as legate in correspondence to the Council, and only describes Arcadius, Projetus, and Philip as those who \"filled the place of the Apostolic See\"8 The fact that he sent legates at all shows that Cyril did not represent him.\n \n Three months before the Council had been called, Pope Celestin had issued an excommunication on Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople. The Council, however, ignored this and treated Nestorius as the proper Patriarch of Constantinople. The council then proceeded to examine the evidence and pronounced its own sentence: \"The holy Synod...to Nestorius the new Judas: Know that for thy impious doctrines thou was deposed by the holy Synod agreeably to the laws of the Church\"9\n \n \n That is, they ignored the excommunication of Celestine and judged him for themselves. Pope Pius XI tried to put a spin on this saying that they merely ratified Celestine's sentence. This is not so, as shown Nestorius was accepted with honour, until the sentence was passed. The Emperor himself had invited Nestorius \"...In November the emperor, not regarding the papal condemnation as definitive, had already convoked a general council...\"10\n \n \n Further, Roman Catholic historian Bishop Maret says \"The Pope pronounced in the affair of Nestorius a canonical judgment clothed with all the authority of his see. He had prescribed its execution. Yet, however, three months after this sentence and before its execution, all the episcopate is invited to examine afresh and to decide freely the question in dispute...\"11\n \n In summary then your bulk of evidences can be whittled away once we remove quotes that don't support your case - through not even mentioning St.Peter or Rome, or to those that simply refer to the status of St. Peter - because there's no link between him being given great honour and those honours being only bestowed upon one particular bishopric that he founded (out of many)... Then there are the quotes you take out of context, specifically those of St. Cyprian, whom I have shown, understood the Bishop of Rome's position differently from what you would have readers believe. Then there are quotes I can't independently check, but going on the record of other quotes, I wouldn't like to bet that they support your case either.\n \n Thus in conclusion, Maximus' claim that there is a list somewhere that supports him, is true, only insofar as there is a list. What credibility is there for a church to make use of such dubious and selective use of quotes? If their case was so water-tight. It is akin to the \"Donation of Constantine\" wherein the Church forged a \"will and testament\" of the Emperor Constantine. And they continued to quote from it, long after its fakery was known.\n \n ENDNOTES\n 1 by Jean de Launoy Epist.

Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.\n (Ibid).\n \n If you had read my post, which wasn't all that long, you'd have seen...\n Post #79\n \nFrom what I understand of it, and from reading \"The Orthodox Veneration of Mary the Birthgiver of God\" (by John Maximovitch) it is placing Mary, a human, too high.\n\n Which strongly suggests that we Orthodox 'venerate' Mary (see title of the book). So, you didn't need to 'rely' on my signature.\n \n If your question is 'why?' (Which you didn't ask, but let's just assume that's what you were heading towards), then....\n \n The prayer itself is based in Scripture;\n Luke 1: 26 In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, 27 to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary. 28 The angel went to her and said, \"Hail Mary, full of Grace! The Lord is with you.\"\n and\n Luke 1: 42 In a loud voice she exclaimed: \"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!\"\n \n And Mary says of herself,\n Luke 1:46 And Mary said: \"My soul glorifies the Lord 47 and my spirit rejoices in God my Savoir, 48 for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed, 49 for the Mighty One has done great things for me-- holy is his name. 50 His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation. 51 He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts. 52 He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble. 53 He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty. 54 He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful 55 to Abraham and his descendants forever, even as he said to our fathers.\"\n \n \n *Much as the Scots can claim ownership of a great many things, this is not one of them.\n \n **Scottish can refer to many non-Gaels of Scotland of which there are many, even in an historic sense, such as those of the Orkneys and Shetland Isles, and also many lowlanders never identified as Gaels. Also, Scots can refer to the form of language akin to English that was spoken in the lowlands and Borders areas which supplanted Gaelic as the official language c. the reign of David I.",

   "All references from \"The Orthodox Veneration of Mary the Birthgiver of God\" (by John Maximovitch) unless otherwise stated. (Note: an on-line version of this is available at\n http://www.stmaryofegypt.org/library/st_john_maximovich/on_veneration_of_the_theotokos.htm)\n \n The first person to voice the idea of the Immaculate Conception was Paschasius Radbertus in the 12th Century (Ibid, p48). It was denounced by Thomas Aquinas and Bernard of Clarirvaux\n \n The nun Bridget of Sweden claimed to receive a vision of Mary, telling her that she (Mary) had been immaculately conceived, however another noted visionary, and a Doctor of the Catholic Church, Catherine of Sienna, had a vision of Mary, telling her that she (Mary) HAD NOT BEEN immaculately conceived.\n \n Here is a classic example of a half-truth debate about a half-truth...\n \"Q: In another question you said that St. Thomas Aquinas explained why Mary submitted to a Mosaic purification ritual even though she was sinless, something which you said he and virtually everyone in his day accepted. But I have heard a Protestant apologist repeatedly say that Aquinas rejected the Immaculate Conception. What's the deal?\n \n A: What the Protestant apologist said is a classic example of a half-truth. Evangelicals often use the fact that Aquinas (unlike others of his age) did not believe that Mary was entirely sanctified from the moment of her conception to imply that she committed actual, personal sin--as Protestants assert. However, nothing could be further from the truth. Even though Aquinas did not claim that Mary was sanctified from the moment of her conception, he did claim that she was sanctified before her birth, and so never committed personal sin (for unborn children commit no personal sin; cf. Rom. 9:11).\"\n http://www.cin.org/users/james/questions/q052.htm\n For this to be true, this Catholic Apologist site is suggesting that all children are immaculately conceived. This is a distortion then of Aquinas' real objections to the doctrine, which is why another Catholic site can say\n \"The Immaculate Conception\n Let's take the Immaculate Conception first. As you probably know, the Immaculate Conception of Mary was declared to be a dogma of the Church in 1854. Before that time, it was merely what we call a theolegoumenon (a theological opinion). Thus, before the Church solemnly defined it in 1854, Catholics were free to either believe in the Immaculate Conception or reject it. Indeed, even some of our greatest Catholic saints, such as Thomas Aquinas and Bernard of Clairvaux...had serious problems with the idea that she was conceived without original sin (although they believed she was personally sinless). Yet, despite this, there were also others in the Church, such as St. Bonaventure and Blessed Duns Scotus who championed the Immaculate Conception. So, the Immaculate Conception was a debated question in the Church for centuries.\"\n http://www.bringyou.to/apologetics/a28.htm\n \n From this novel teaching the Pope also derived a case for Infallibility. The same pope it could be argued, that if he could introduce new doctrine, then he could speak infallibly. And from this elevation of Mary comes the push to have her declared equal of Jesus.\n In three respects - as Daughter, as Mother, and as Spouse of God - the Holy Virgin is exalted to a certain equality with the Father, to a certain superiority over the Son, to a certain nearness to the Holy Spirit\" (The Immaculate Conception\" Malou, Bishop of Brouges) (Ibid p52)\n \n Here is what St. Epiphanius of Cyprus said in this regard; representing the Orthodox position: \n \n \"There is equal harm in both these heresies, both when men demean the Virgin and when, on the contrary, they glorify her beyond what is proper. Let Mary be in honour, but let worship be given to the Lord\" (Panarion, \"Against the Collyridians\"); \n \n \"Although Mary is a chosen vessel, still she was a woman by nature, not to be distinguished at all from others. Although the history of Mary and Tradition relate that it was said to her father Joachim in the desert, 'Thy wife hath conceived,' still this was done not without marital union and not without the seed of man\" (same source as above); and \n \n \"One should not revere the saints above what is proper, but should revere their Master. Mary is not God, and did not receive a body from heaven, but from the joining of man and woman; and according to the promise, like Isaac, she was prepared to take part in the Divine Economy. But, on the other hand, let none dare foolishly to offend the Holy Virgin\" (St. Epiphanius, Against the Antidikomarionites)",
