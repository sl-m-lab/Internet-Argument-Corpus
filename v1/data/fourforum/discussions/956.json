I loved Domino's pizza when I was going to college in Plattsburgh, NY. Pizza was good from all the mom and pop stores in the New York City suburbs where I grew up so we had no need for the chain stores there. I now live in St Petersburg Florida and Domino's, Hungry Howie's, Pizza Hut etc. pizza all make me want to throw up. It just tastes god awful! It tastes like they dumped raw tomato sauce on top and heated it (never cooked the sauce). I just gave up eating pizza completely because it was awful everywhere here in Florida. Now a place called 'Mario's Pizza' opened near my house and it actually tastes like pizza did back in NY (or at least very close).",

A large pizza, which will generally feed 2 people or 1 hungry teenager, can often be had for $5 AUS, which is about $4 US. Their pepperoni pizza has 8 slices of pepperoni, and their quality is both low and highly variable.\n \n I'm much more a fan of Dominoes, costs about twice as much, but its quality approaches that of \"real\" pizza places, and I will gladly eat it.\n \n \n \n One thing I both love and hate about the US, and I haven't often been there, is the size of portions. I mean when you order ribs, you got so many ribs you can barely eat them all. And after your meal you have to sleep.
