   "Hi guys,\n \n Just thought you might like to know that this isn't a problem confined to those of you across that rather large pond that is the Atlantic.\n \n In the UK, a group called Truth in Science (pretentious name, homepage here), are setting up that ID should be taught in order to allow 'a critical approach to Darwinism in science lessons' (see article here)\n \n Seems to me this means one of two things. Either: The ID/fundie community (I draw no line between them, one is merely the others slightly smarter, more city-slick cousin) is getting frustrated in the US and has decided that they might have more chance of getting in through the British tradition of fair play (equal time to even the stupidest ideas, we've got a 'Jedi' in the House of Commons for ****'s sake), or the ID/fundie community is working on the 'Well, they teach it in Britain. Must be OK if they do it'. I don't know how well that one flies in the US, but it has some influence on Europe. It's perfectly possible that there's some longer game here, but I'm rather worried that some twit will actually let this in the classroom. At the moment, it's recognised for what it is, however will that last?",

   "Thanks for that link, it seems I managed to miss that one. I do remember the Archbishop of Canterbury arguing against the teaching of Creationism in Science lessons (I'm now waiting for Marc9000 to accuse him of atheism). \n \n The only thing I would say though is that I'm hearing more and more of this debate creeping into the UK. Maybe you heard that Australian Creationist arguing that schools that don't teach design are forcing their pupils into depression and so forth. Also given that there is no equivalent to the separation of the church and state clause in English/UK law (sorry gents, I've forgotten which Clause it is), surely that sort of stuff is easier to slip in over here. I went to a school with compulsary church attendance twice a week. It didn't do me any harm, but I hate to think what would happen if the happy clappy (evangelical) or some of the more virulent christian sects got hold of that sort of system. \n \n I will say also that there is no legal history over here. On that note, following on from Ripskar's link, has anyone waved John F. Haught, Professor of Theology at Georgetown University in Marc's face? Surely a Profesor of Theology has to have some clue what he's talking about...",
