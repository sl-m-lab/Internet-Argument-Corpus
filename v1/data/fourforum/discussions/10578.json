   "A GRIEVING father has won a nearly $US11 million ($11.8 million) verdict against a fundamentalist church that pickets military funerals in the belief that the war in Iraq is a punishment for the US's tolerance of homosexuality.\n \n Albert Snyder sued the Westboro Baptist Church, based in Topeka, Kansas, for unspecified damages after members demonstrated at the March, 2006, funeral of his son, Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder, who was killed in Iraq. Among the signs church members displayed at the funeral was one that read: \"Thank God for Dead Soldiers\".\n \n A federal jury in Baltimore on Wednesday first awarded $US2.9 million in compensatory damages. It later awarded $US6 million in punitive damages for invasion of privacy and $US2 million for causing emotional distress.\n \n Earlier, church members demonstrated outside the courthouse. Pastor Fred Phelps held a sign reading \"God is your enemy\", while his daughter and co-defendant, Shirley Phelps-Roper, stood on an American flag and carried a sign that read: \"God hates ### enablers\". Members of the group sang God Hates America to the tune of God Bless America.\n \n One of the defendants said the civil award was the first against the church, whose members have stirred outrage by picketing at funerals for service members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, often carrying placards bearing virulent anti-gay slogans.\n \n The church maintains that God is punishing the US, killing and maiming troops, because the country tolerates homosexuality.\n \n Mr Phelps scoffed at the jury and the award. \"It was a bunch of silly heads passing judgment on God,\" he said. The church would appeal, and he predicted that a higher court would overturn the award \"in five minutes\".\n \n In the lawsuit, Lance Corporal Snyder's family said it had suffered invasion of privacy and infliction of emotional distress.\n \n \"The fact of the matter is, a funeral's private,\" one of their lawyers, Sean Summers, said.\n \n The church reportedly has fewer than 100 members, and it is unclear whether the award will be collected. After the jury awarded the smaller compensatory damages, the District Judge, Richard Bennett, said that the size of that award \"far exceeds the net worth of the defendants\".\n \n In his closing arguments during the punitive damages phase, the plaintiffs' lawyer, Craig Trebilcock, described church members as bullies who \"seek out those among us who are at the weakest point in our lives\".\n \n \"That's why they've gotten away with it,\" he said. Grieving families were too weak to fight back \"until [Mr Snyder].\"\n \n As a result of the pickets, several states have passed bills restricting protests at funerals or tightening existing limits, and legislators in more than a dozen other states are considering such measures.\n \n Ms Phelps-Roper said the verdict made her 50th birthday on Tuesday a happier one. It would help the church, many of whose members are from the Phelps family, get its message out, she said.\n \n \"We're making new signs: 'Thank God for $US10.9 million'. Listen to that amount. It's so laughable,\" she said. \"It was all I could do not to laugh. You guys think you can change God?\"\n \n The Washington Post, Associated Press",

The motivation for Phelps and company's pickets is his hatred of \"homosexuality,\" and his insistence that \"God hates f&gs.\" He claims America is doomed for being too accepting of gay people. This issue IS about gays. Phelps is not picketing because he hates dead soldiers or grieving families, although his pickets certainly do show disrespect for grieving families and their lost loved ones, no doubt. \n \n I'm curious why YOU don't say anything about respect for gay people, who are the real targets of Phelps and his gang of nuts. Phelps started out by picketing the funerals of gay men, and when that didn't garner him enough attention, he switched tactics and began picketing the funerals of troops. The troops and their families are just a tactic for him; they are not the point of his attacks. This is just a tactic for Phelps to draw attention. \n \n Whether religion is a good thing or not is a debatable question, and I think it depends on which forms of religion we are talking about.

   "Easyrider, this is not \"yet another study\".\n This is an old study that has been REPEATEDLY DISPROVEN as employing false techniques...\n Critique of \"Obituary Study\" by the Paul Cameron Group\n Their conclusion - that homosexual men and women have a shorter life span than heterosexual men and women - provides a textbook example of the perils of using data from a convenience sample to generalize to an entire population.\n \n Death Notices and Obituaries \n Most city newspapers include a section containing death notices for community residents. These notices - which can carry a small fee for printing - typically list the name, age, address, and survivors of the deceased, along with information about funeral or memorial services. Funeral directors often assist the loved ones of the deceased in submitting such notices.\n \n Gay community newspapers do not have sections of death notices. When the AIDS epidemic began to claim the lives of so many gay and bisexual men in the 1980s, however, many gay newspapers began to print obituaries. Except in the case of prominent community figures, these obituaries are typically written by (or based on information from) the loved ones of the deceased.\n \n Assuming that the deceased person wasn't famous, an obituary appears in a gay community newspaper only if (1) a loved one or friend notifies the newspaper about the death (and, in many cases, writes the obituary) and (2) the editor decides to print the obituary.\n \n Consequently, many gay men and lesbians who die never have an obituary in a gay community publication. Here are just a few examples of who is left out of gay newspapers' obituaries.\n [*]* gay men and lesbians who were not involved in the gay community[*] * gay men and lesbians who were in the closet about their sexual orientation[*] * gay men and lesbians whose loved ones or family didn't want their homosexuality to be known[*] * gay men and lesbians whose loved ones or family simply didn't think of sending an obituary to a gay community newspaper[*] * gay men and lesbians whose loved ones did not write an obituary for some other reason (e.g., they were too grief stricken)[*] * gay men and lesbians who died without leaving anyone to write an obituary for a gay publication (e.g., those whose loved ones and relatives died before them).\n An accurate estimate of the life span of gay men and lesbians would have to count such people. By restricting their analysis to obituaries in gay newspapers, however, the Cameron group systematically excluded them from the sample.\n \n \n Internal Inconsistencies \n The inadequacy of the Cameron group's approach is evident from internal inconsistencies within their own data. Compare the data about lesbians reported in their obituary study, for example, to data from their so-called national survey.\n \n In their obituary study, the Cameron group claimed that the average lesbian life-span is similar to that of gay men who do not have AIDS (\"under 50 years\" versus \"mid-40s,\" respectively). But if this is true, and if obituaries are indeed a valid source for this type of data, the ratio of gay male obituaries to lesbian obituaries should be about the same as the ratio of gay men to lesbians in the population.\n \n From their survey data, the Cameron group has claimed to know the number of gay men and lesbians in the population. If we believed their numbers, we would set the ratio of gay men-to-lesbians at about 1.6-to-1 (or approximately 2.6-to-1 if bisexuals are omitted).\n \n But the ratio of gay male-to-lesbian obituaries in the Cameron group's study is quite different - approximately 6-to-1 if AIDS and violent deaths are excluded, 32-to-1 if they are included.\n \n Thus, at least one data set has to be wrong. Either the obituaries data do not include a representative sample of lesbians, or the Cameron group's population estimates based on their survey data are invalid.\n \n An observer with training in research methodology would most likely conclude that both sets of data are fatally flawed. \n \n The 2005 article explicitly mentions the \"study\" was done by Paul Cameron.\n I don't know if you realize it or not, but Paul Cameron is renowned as an anti-gay liar. There are only two people whose work I think should be rejected as a matter of automatic recognition of a faulty source. Paul Cameron is one of those people.\n He has just been busted too many times for lying...\n # On December 2, 1983, the American Psychological Association sent Paul Cameron a letter informing him that he had been dropped from membership. Early in 1984, all members of the American Psychological Association received official written notice that \"Paul Cameron (Nebraska) was dropped from membership for a violation of the Preamble to the Ethical Principles of Psychologists\" by the APA Board of Directors.5 Cameron has posted an elaborate argument about his expulsion from APA on his website, claiming that he resigned from APA before he was dropped from membership. Like most organizations, however, APA does not allow a member to resign when they are being investigated. And even if Cameron's claims were accepted as true, it would be remarkable that the largest professional organization of psychologists in the United States (and other professional associations, as noted below) went to such lengths to disassociate itself from one individual.\n \n # At its membership meeting on October 19, 1984, the Nebraska Psychological Association adopted a resolution stating that it \"formally disassociates itself from the representations and interpretations of scientific literature offered by Dr. Paul Cameron in his writings and public statements on sexuality.\"6\n \n # In 1985, the American Sociological Association (ASA) adopted a resolution which asserted that \"Dr. Paul Cameron has consistently misinterpreted and misrepresented sociological research on sexuality, homosexuality, and lesbianism\" and noted that \"Dr. Paul Cameron has repeatedly campaigned for the abrogation of the civil rights of lesbians and gay men, substantiating his call on the basis of his distorted interpretation of this research.\"7 The resolution formally charged an ASA committee with the task of \"critically evaluating and publicly responding to the work of Dr. Paul Cameron.\"\n \n At its August, 1986 meeting, the ASA officially accepted the committee's report and passed the following resolution:\n  The American Sociological Association officially and publicly states that Paul Cameron is not a sociologist, and condemns his consistent misrepresentation of sociological research. Information on this action and a copy of the report by the Committee on the Status of Homosexuals in Sociology, \"The Paul Cameron Case,\" is to be published in Footnotes, and be sent to the officers of all regional and state sociological associations and to the Canadian Sociological Association with a request that they alert their members to Cameron's frequent lecture and media appearances.\"8\n \n # In August, 1996, the Canadian Psychological Association adopted the following policy statement:\n  The Canadian Psychological Association takes the position that Dr. Paul Cameron has consistently misinterpreted and misrepresented research on sexuality, homosexuality, and lesbianism and thus, it formally disassociates itself from the representation and interpretations of scientific literature in his writings and public statements on sexuality.\n # Cameron's credibility was also questioned outside of academia. In his written opinion in Baker v. Wade (1985), Judge Buchmeyer of the U.S. District Court of Dallas referred to \"Cameron's sworn statement that 'homosexuals abuse children at a proportionately greater incident than do heterosexuals,'\" and concluded that \"Dr. Paul Cameron...has himself made misrepresentations to this Court\" and that \"There has been no fraud or misrepresentations except by Dr. Cameron\" (p.536).9 Paul Cameron Bio and Fact Sheet\n \n Sorry, but you quoted yet another example of anti-gay attack which compromised scientific integrity and honesty.",

In addition to the group of physicians who presented their findings to Parliament in a referenced brief last week (see LifeSiteNews.com coverage Same-Sex &#8216;Marriage&#8217; a Health Risk Doctors Warn Parliamentarians ), two other doctors have approached LifeSiteNews.com to submit evidence but requested anonymity based on fear of retribution from homosexual activists.\n \n The doctors noted that they are concerned for individuals practicing dangerous homosexual sex practices but also for society in that the normalization of such sex practices through same sex &#8216;marriage&#8217; legislation will result in a major added burden on health care.\n \n &#8220;Legalization of same sex marriage by the government would give the false message that homosexual sex practices, such as anal intercourse, as long as &#8216;practiced safely&#8217;, are not endangering the health of the partners,&#8221; said Dr. C.\n \n Providing rather explicit details which she felt the public must be aware of, she explained, &#8220;Anal intercourse causes abrasions of the relatively fragile rectal wall, especially in the receptive partner. The penetration of E.coli, always present in the stool, and other bacteria, viruses and parasites penetrate through such lesions into the deeper body tissues. This leads to the suppression of the immune system of such individuals even if there is no exposure to HIV. The immune suppression increases the risk to develop certain cancers, opportunistic infections, to which otherwise one would be resistant, and other health problems including the risk of premature death.&#8221;\n \n Information on the health risks of gay sex is available from the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association (GLMA). A survey by members of the GLMA released in August 2002 listed the main health problems affecting homosexual men. According to Christopher E. Harris, MD, GLMA President and Vincent M.B. Silenzio, MD, MPH, there are increased health risks for homosexual men.\n \n The most common health problems in homosexual men are:\n \n 1. Increased incidence of infectious diseases \n - HIV/AIDS* \n - syphilis\n - gonorrhea\n - chlamydia \n - pubic lice \n - hepatitis A\n - hepatitis B\n - hepatitis C\n - anal papilloma\n \n 2. Increased incidence of cancer especially\n - colon/rectal\n - prostate\n - testicular\n \n 3. Increased incidence of eating disorders \n - bulimia\n - anorexia nervosa\n - obesity\n \n 4. Increased incidences of other psychological problems\n - anxiety\n - depression\n - suicide\n \n 5. Increased incidence of addiction problems especially \n - tobacco\n - alcohol\n - street drugs\n - amyl nitrates (poppers)\n \n See also\n Physician Says Science of Medical Consequences of Homosexual Behaviour is Being Trumped by Political Agenda\n Physician Says Science of Medical Consequences of Homosexual Behaviour is Being Trumped by Political Agenda\n \n http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2005/feb/05021811.html",

In addition to the group of physicians who presented their findings to Parliament in a referenced brief last week (see LifeSiteNews.com coverage Same-Sex 'Marriage' a Health Risk Doctors Warn Parliamentarians ), two other doctors have approached LifeSiteNews.com to submit evidence but requested anonymity based on fear of retribution from homosexual activists.\n\n \n Lifesite news.... Oh come on.. Want to post some things from NOM as well? I'm sure everyone will take that seriously too.\n \n \n\n The doctors noted that they are concerned for individuals practicing dangerous homosexual sex practices but also for society in that the normalization of such sex practices through same sex 'marriage' legislation will result in a major added burden on health care.\n\n \n Gays and Lesbians engaging in a monogamous sexual act with their husband or wife will add a burden on health care? who writes this ####?? \n \n \n\n \"Legalization of same sex marriage by the government would give the false message that homosexual sex practices, such as anal intercourse, as long as 'practiced safely', are not endangering the health of the partners,\" said Dr. C.\n\n \n Oh lord.... And heterosexuals are just as much at risk for HIV and STDS as gays and lesbians. Once again playing the fear card on the ignorant...\n \n \n\n \n Providing rather explicit details which she felt the public must be aware of, she explained, \"Anal intercourse causes abrasions of the relatively fragile rectal wall, especially in the receptive partner. The penetration of E.coli, always present in the stool, and other bacteria, viruses and parasites penetrate through such lesions into the deeper body tissues. This leads to the suppression of the immune system of such individuals even if there is no exposure to HIV. The immune suppression increases the risk to develop certain cancers, opportunistic infections, to which otherwise one would be resistant, and other health problems including the risk of premature death.\"\n \n\n \n What does anal sex have to do with marriage? What if a gay couple doesn't have sex? Some argument this is. And one who engages in this \"act\" as listed above. I can say this is defunct garbage. Any health care professional will tell you otherwise that isn't on the radical right's payroll that is. \n \n \n\n \n Information on the health risks of gay sex is available from the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association (GLMA). A survey by members of the GLMA released in August 2002 listed the main health problems affecting homosexual men. According to Christopher E. Harris, MD, GLMA President and Vincent M.B. Silenzio, MD, MPH, there are increased health risks for homosexual men.\n\n \n Once again health risks of unprotected sex and multiple partners, etc. Not a monogamous relationship where both have been tested and given the Ok...\n \n \n\n \n The most common health problems in homosexual men are:\n \n 1. Increased incidence of infectious diseases \n - HIV/AIDS* \n - syphilis\n - gonorrhea\n - chlamydia \n - pubic lice \n - hepatitis A\n - hepatitis B\n - hepatitis C\n - anal papilloma\n \n 2. Increased incidence of cancer especially\n - colon/rectal\n - prostate\n - testicular\n \n 3. Increased incidence of eating disorders \n - bulimia\n - anorexia nervosa\n - obesity\n \n 4. Increased incidences of other psychological problems\n - anxiety\n - depression\n - suicide\n \n 5. Increased incidence of addiction problems especially \n - tobacco\n - alcohol\n - street drugs\n - amyl nitrates (poppers)\n \n See also\n Physician Says Science of Medical Consequences of Homosexual Behaviour is Being Trumped by Political Agenda\n Physician Says Science of Medical Consequences of Homosexual Behaviour is Being Trumped by Political Agenda\n \n Doctors Say Legalizing Same-Sex Marriage Will Give False Impression Gay Sex is Safe\n\n \n I just love this list.

As for talking like a woman, many people believe that gay men speak with a lisp. Do women speak with a lisp? What about the gay men who don't have a lisp? What is it about their speech which is like a woman? How does a woman move? If you are under the impression that a woman moves like Marilyn Monroe you are misinformed. As for the men (gay or straight) that do move like Marilyn Monroe they are called female impersonators.",

   "Depending on how you feel about same-sex marriage, the results of a Gallup poll released this morning might surprise you, or seem to state the obvious.\n \n The poll's big finding is that 57 percent of Americans currently oppose making same-sex marriages legal - essentially the same number as last year. And support for those marriages appears to have stalled at 40 percent, after peaking at 46 percent in 2007.\n \n But demographically, things get a bit more complicated: youngsters (18-to-29-year-olds) favor gay marriage 59 percent to 37 percent. Perhaps predictably, a majority of every older age group oppose same-sex marriage (with increasing margins; 66 percent of those past 65 oppose it). The obvious conclusion? The future belongs to same-sex marriage supporters, demographically speaking.\n \n From Gallup's release on the poll results:\n \n The lack of change in public opinion on same-sex marriage seen in the new USA Today/Gallup poll occurs in an environment in which an increasing number of states have taken steps to legalize such unions. Same-sex marriages are now legal in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, and Iowa, and will be legal in Vermont in September.\n \n On Tuesday, California's Supreme Court refused to add that state to the list, by upholding the Proposition 8 referendum, approved by voters, that banned same-sex marriage in the state. The referendum was put on the November 2008 ballot in response to an earlier court decision that allowed same-sex couples to legally marry in California.\n \n Among major demographic or attitudinal subgroups, self-identified liberals show the greatest support for legal gay marriage at 75% in the May 7-10 poll. By contrast, only 19% of conservatives think same-sex marriages should be legally valid.\n \n Just a slim majority (55%) of Democrats approve of gay marriage, but they are more likely to do so than independents (45%) and Republicans (20%).\n -Jeremy Gantz\n \n \n The Raw Story Majority of Americans oppose gay marriage",

   "The change is coming, as older people like me die off and younger people become active voters. The change is coming faster than I had ever anticipated. Same-sex marriage is already a reality. It may not become a reality in all states in my lifetime, but it is a reality in more states now than I ever expected in so short a period. I think that when voters go back to amend the California constitution again, to once again legalize same-sex marriage there, the marriage equality side will win. The more publicity and exposure the issue gets, the more people think about it, and the more they realize that arguments against legalizing same-sex marriage make no sense. \n \n Btw, in 1967, the year that the Supreme Court struck down state laws barring inter-racial marriage, a Gallup poll showed that 72% of Americans surveyed opposed inter-racial marriage. A greater percentage of Americans today support same-sex marriage than supported inter-racial marriage in the year it was legalized nationwide.",

It seems to me that changing the process for amending the state constitution might actually be a revision of the constitution, and this may have to go through the legislature. But I don't know. \n \n Meanwhile, there is an interesting story in the NYTimes today about the federal lawsuit being filed by the two lawyers who duked it out in Bush v. Gore back in 2000. They have teamed up to file a suit challenging the California constitutional marriage ban as a violation of the 14th amendment of the U.S. constitution. The article quotes lawyers and equality activists who have labored long for equal marriage rights. They are concerned that these two famous lawyers and their plaintiffs have jumped in at the wrong time to file a federal lawsuit.
