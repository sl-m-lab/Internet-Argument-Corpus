   "I know this doesn't apply to you JPS, but for everyone else: Drag racing is done at a sanctioned off road track. Too many people are reffering to street racing as drag racing. While the action and goal are the same, the place makes a huge difference.\n \n The nearest strip to me is a solid two hour drive one way.

It makes me dizzy.",

   "Drag racing has come a long way since the first strips opened. Back in the mid '50's I had a new BSA 650cc twin that I thought was fast. I took it to the strip and entered it in the Stock class. EVERBODY beat me and it didn't take long to figure out that I had the only really stock bike in the class. On Monday we changed the cam, enlarged the carb port, ported and polished the head and changed the primary gear. The next Sunday I made it to the trophy dash before being eliminated. You could put up $25 and challenge, but since we all cheated nobody did. There were some weird machines back then, you might see a Model A with an Olds V8 hooked to a LaSalle transmission driving truck rims. Art Afrons had a rail with a 1200hp Allison aircraft engine that had liquid clutches to keep from snapping the axles. A friend of mine had a 90 inch stroked harley he ran on alcahol and nitro which blew the engine with regularity. Nowadays, fairness and safty are strictly maintained and the machines are awesume.\n Dono",
