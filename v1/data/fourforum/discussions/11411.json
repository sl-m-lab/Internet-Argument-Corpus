The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. The ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.\" Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment, 1764.",

Constitution Art. 1 \u00a7 13\n \n That civil power is exercised by the Governor:\n \n \"The Governor shall be commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the Commonwealth and shall have power to embody such forces to repel invasion, suppress insurrection, and enforce the execution of the laws.\"\n Va. Constitution Art. 5 \u00a7 7\n \n However, Congress also has the power at any time to \"federalize\" the state militia and place it under control of the federal government for the following purposes:\n \n \"To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions\" U.S. Constitution Art. 1, \u00a7 8 \n \n When this is done, the Governor loses his control over the militia, and the President assumes control:\n \n \"The President shall be the commander in chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several states, when called into the actual service of the United States.\" U.S. Constitution Art. 2 \u00a7 2\n \n In the Militia Act of 1792 Congress effectively transferred its power of \"calling forth the militia\" to the president. The act gave standing authority to the President to call forth the militia into federal service without having to wait for Congress to do so in specific response to an emergency. The events permitting this standing Presidential authority are \"whenever the United States shall be invaded, or be in imminent danger of invasion from any foreign nation or Indian tribe,\" and/or \"whenever the laws of the United States shall be opposed or the execution thereof obstructed, in any state, by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by the powers vested in the marshals by this act.\" \n \n This was apparently done in response to fears that rebellion, invasion, or other troubles could occur while Congress was out of session or while Congress was in session but for other reasons prove too slow to react to the crisis.",

This would be due to the changed range, power and (most importantly) availability of firearms.\n \n To insist on quotes from 'dead people' is to insist, largely, on validating the opinions of pre-1930 as relevant to today's situation, which is (IMO) stacking the boards somewhat. \n \n Disclaimer: I realise that people have died since 1930, but I doubt that Ethmi would accept them - he seems to be talking about the era rather than the people, just as if a famous gun critic died today he would refuse a quote from them tomorrow. Surely to ask for 'dead people' regards the era in which they lived as opposed to whether they are alive or not? If this is not the case, and Ethmi was being absolutely literal in his question, I would say that it's a fairly daft requirement - why would he ask for it, if not purely to bias his results?\n \n Regardless of all of this, that the OP is entirely an appeal to authority still stands.\n \n IN-POST EDIT: re-reading the OP, Ethmi states the criteria 'historical figures' as well as 'dead people only'. Definitely out of date by my standards - see the rest of this post for why.\n \n (REAL) EDIT: Going back to the interesting topic of 'immutable rights', I should probably add/restate that I consider a 'right' to be appropriate only if it can be re-validated by the situation of the time. Thus the 'out of date-ness' is a valid argument (for me, at least).",
