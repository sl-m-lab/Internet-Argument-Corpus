   "I just love watching you guys argue over Creation vs. Evolution. First off you creationist need to know what you're arguing about. Evolution is a fact, it happens, it's been proven. Now, what you're arguing about it Darwin's \"Theory of Human Evolution\", not the process of evolution. So start getting your argument right. \n \n As I stated above, Darwin's \"Theory of Human Evolution\", It's a theory. Another word for theory is guessing. The same for creation. Faith is not knowing something to be true, it's believing in something that can't be proven. This whole silly fight is over something that can't be proven unless someone goes travels back in time or someone comes back after being dead and buried, and seeing a bright light doesn't mean you rose from death.\n \n Most of all, I think it's really funny because you're fighting over the same thing. The only difference is the way you look at it. One is a religious perspective and the other a scientific one. Maybe \"God\" did create the universe, and the science is just the detailed explanation of the process \"God\" used.\n \n See, it all just really silly.",

   "To Clive14:\n \n Darwin never produced a \"Theory of Human Evolution\".  \n \n R--i--g--h--t. And I'm a Shakespearean act--o--r. Darwin's book titled \"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life\" sure seems to me to suggest that he had an idea on the evolution of man. Darwinian evolution was (and still is) inherently a racist philosophy, teaching that different groups or \"races\" of people evolved at different times and rates, so some groups are more like their ape-like ancestors than others. Darwin believed, for instance, that the Australian Aboriginals were considered the missing links between an ape-like ancestor and the rest of mankind\". Many indigenous peoples died because of Darwinian evolution, so don't give me such rubbish that Darwin never did a theory of human evolution.\n Darwin's evolutionary scheme went something like this:\n Evolutionary ancestor --< Australoid --< Negroid --< Mongoloid --< Caucasoid.\n \n Perhaps you best go home and check up on your own theory before you post such a remark. And people think that creationists are mis-informed!\n \n This is true of the unscientific use of the word \"theory\". In science, \"theory\" is equivalent to \"fact\". There is a theory of gravity for example. Is gravity just guesswork therefore?\n \n Once again, falsehood. If a theory is equivalent to fact, than why do they have two different things. In science, using you above example, gravity is a fact (I don't think that there is a theory of gravity, at least it is not in the HSC Physics course when we were studying it!). By definition, a theory is an explanation of observed facts and laws. It is supported by experiments upon which it is based, and is confirmed by experiments designed to test predictions based on the explanation. Now where in that definition is the word fact either used or implied? Now where, a theory is like a story to explain observed facts and phenomenon. A theory does not mean the idea is \"fact\". It is just a story used to explain how some observed phenomenon may have either came into existence, or why and how it behaves the way it does. You mis-interpretation of scientific terms is noted.\n \n I disagree. Faith is believing something to be true regardless of the evidence. People have faith in the Bible. People do not (or should not) have faith in evolution. \n \n I agree with your definition of faith. Bible believing creationists must take it by faith that there is a God, and that the Bible is the Inspired Word of God. Evolutionists (for the most part, i.e. most are atheistic), however, must take it by blind faith that there is no God and that the Bible is not the Inspired Word of God.\n \n Your last sentence struck me as to how brainwashed some (or many people) are in the lie of evolution (microorganism into people evolution). For one, evolutionists must take it by blind faith that stuff has evolved, i.e. there is very few fossils that support this notion. The fossil record dismisses and is a crushing critque of Darwinian evolution. For example, Dr Ronald R. West (paleoecology and geology) stated in his article \"Paleoecology and uniformitarianism\" which was published in Compass, vol.45, May 1968, p. 216:\n \"Contrary to what most scientists write, the fossil record does not support the Darwinian theory of evolution [microorganism to man] because it is this theory (there are several) which we use to interpret the fossil record. By doing so we are guilty of circular reasoning if we then say the fossil record supports this theory.\" \n \n In addition to this, Dr David B. Kitts (School of Geology and Geophysics, Department of History of Science) in his article \"Paleontology and evolutionary theory\" in Evolution, vol. 28, September 1974, p. 467 says the following:\n \"Despite the bright promise that paleonotlogy provides a means of \"seeing\" evolution, it has presented some nasty difficulties for evolutionists the most notorious of which is the presence of \"gaps\" in the fossil record. Evolution requires intermediate forms between species and paleontology does not provide them. The gaps must therefore be a contingent feature of the record.\" \n \n What they are saying is that the fossil record does not show evolution, but we will continue to believe it even though we have no proof of the theory of evolution (i.e. microorganism to man evolution).\n \n Evolution has been proven. Creation has been disproven. This whole argument is over stubbornness on the part of people with faith who cannot bring themselves to accept that evolution has been proven and creation has been disproven. \n \n Four words that always gets an evolutionist into trouble, \"Evolution has been proven\". If you refer to what you call \"micro-evolution\" (to which creationists call \"Varriation within a \"kind\"\") than I would agree with you. Species change all of the time, but it is important to know that the species never get more complex, they are constantly losing gentic information (i.e. DNA) and becoming less complex. With natural selection, things lose an ability that will enable a species to survive in an environment (usually by the way of mutations). So since varriation within a kind (or micro-evolution - always a loss of DNA) has been proved, this is also further evidence to the creationary model. The macro-evolution has not been proven. Nor does the fossil record bear out many evidences for this, as many leading evolutionary scientists have (or are comming) to realise. \n \n Creation has not been disproven, as you falsely claim. Otherwise, the evolutionists here on this forum would be able to hammer the creationist arguments, and thus far they have not. This fact alone is evidence against you. They only gain an advantage when we start having silly debates on things that I do not know much on, nor have studied up on, such as geological features for an example. We have the same rocks, so of course the evolutionists are going to claim that in many cases I am wrong - as they have a different interpretation to me. Or they have a different story to explain who a land structure got there to me. Both stories are based on the evidence, so it is hard to get through to one another. Sadly, time restricts me from continuing.",

   "To Clive 14:\n \n There are no \"kinds\" as no one can define what a kind is. \n \n More false information. You obviously don't search to hard. \n \n From Genesis 1, the ability to produce offspring, i.e. to breed with one another, defines the original created kinds. Linnaeus recognised this, but named many species2 without any breeding experiments, on the basis of such things as flower characteristics. In his mature years he did extensive hybridization (cross-breeding) experiments and realised that his 'species' concept was too narrow for the species to be considered as created kinds; he thought that the genus perhaps corresponded better with the created kind.3,4\n \n Even today, creationists are often misrepresented as believing that God created all the species we have today, just like they are today, in the beginning. This is called 'fixity of species'. The Bible does not teach this. Nevertheless, university professors often show students that a new 'species' has arisen in ferment flies, for example, and then claim that this disproves the Genesis account of creation. Darwin made this very mistake when he studied the finches and tortoises on the Galapagos islands. (He also erred in assuming that creation implied that each organism was made where it is now found; but from the Bible it is clear that today's land-dwelling vertebrates migrated to their present locations after the Flood.)\n \n If two animals or two plants can hybridize (at least enough to produce a truly fertilized egg), then they must belong to (i.e. have descended from) the same original created kind. If the hybridizing species are from different genera in a family, it suggests that the whole family might have come from the one created kind. If the genera are in different families within an order, it suggests that maybe the whole order may have derived from the original created kind.\n \n On the other hand, if two species will not hybridize, it does not necessarily prove that they are not originally from the same kind. We all know of couples who cannot have children, but this does not mean they are separate species!\n \n In the case of three species, A, B and C, if A and B can each hybridize with C, then it suggests that all three are of the same created kind - whether or not A and B can hybridize with each other. Breeding barriers can arise through such things as mutations. For example, two forms of ferment flies (Drosophila) produced offspring that could not breed with the parent species.5 That is, they were a new biological 'species'. This was due to a slight chromosomal rearrangement, not any new genetic information. The new 'species' was indistinguishable from the parents and obviously the same kind as the parents, since it came from them.\n \n Following are some examples of hybrids that show that the created kind is often at a higher level than the species, or even the genus, named by taxonomists. \n The above came from Ligers and wholphins? What next?. \n \n We actually, untill a couple of decades ago, had far more evidence for macro-evolution, in the form of a near continuous series of fossils showing evolution from microbes to all the modern species of life. \n \n Times change. Notice your wording, especially the use of the word \"had\". Now the truth has been exposed. The fossil record does not show microorganism to man evolution. The evolutionists only have a few examples of highly debatable candiates for \"transitional status\" when there should be hundreds of them, if not thousands. \n An example of changing times, in 1960, the point was still being made...\n \"Although the comparative study of living animals and plants may give very convincing cirumstantial evidence, fossils provide the only historical, documentary evidence that life has evolved from simpler to more and more complex forms.\" ~ Carl O. Dunbar, Ph.D. (geology) in Historical Geology, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1960, p.47.\n But more than 20 years later...\n \"In any case, no real evolutionist, whether gradualist or punchtuationist, uses the fossil record as evidence in favour of the theory of evolution as opposed to special creation.\" ~ Mark Ridley (zoologist, Oxford University) in \"Who doubts evolution?\" New Scientist, vol.90, 25 June 1981, p. 831. [No wonder! Note that this was after concerted creationist exposure of the true nature of the fossil record.]\n \n Recently with advances in genetics we have been able to start gathering good evidence of micro-evolution too. Information theory has even started to creep into things now we can measure the increases and decreases in information that various mutations cause. \n \n As I mentioned before, I am not against an information losing micro-evolution, as I call it \"varriation within a kind\". As for the information theory, I would invite you (you can decline to of course) to check out the Evolution: It doesn't add up! article for insight from into information from one of the world's leading information scientists. Also, there is not one mutation that one can point to that will add any useful information to the genome. For a more detailed response into this question, I would once again invite you to check out the How is information content measured? article for a technical analysis of this issue. In fact Dr Lee Spetner, an Israeli biophysicist, has done a very detailed analysis of mutations and he has concluded that there is not one example that one can point to that has actually been observed to increase the genetic information on the molecular level.\n \n Evolution has been proven beyond any sensible reasonable doubt. Anyone who claims otherwise has their head stuck firmly in the sands of reality denial. \n \n I claim otherwise, and my head has - metaphoricly speaking - not been stuck firmly in the snads of reality denial. Nor is it based on faith. It is based on examining the evidence and seeing which side has the model/theory that best fits with the evidence, and I believe that is the creation model.",

   "To Clive14:\n \n Darwin never produced a \"Theory of Human Evolution\".  \n \n R--i--g--h--t. And I'm a Shakespearean act--o--r. Darwin's book titled \"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life\" sure seems to me to suggest that he had an idea on the evolution of man.\nThis is a common view held by people who make a half hearted effort to learn about evolution and then promptly think they are experts. Go read the book. You will find that Darwin uses the words \"races\" and \"varieties\" interchangably throughout the book to refer to both plants and animals. You have fallen for a tired old false creationist argument by believing that races\" in the title refers to people only.\n \n \nDarwinian evolution was (and still is) inherently a racist philosophy, teaching that different groups or \"races\" of people evolved at different times and rates, so some groups are more like their ape-like ancestors than others.\nUntrue. Read the book. Learn about Darwinian evolution and understand your mistake.\n \n \nDarwin believed, for instance, that the Australian Aboriginals were considered the missing links between an ape-like ancestor and the rest of mankind\".\nUntrue. Darwin was a rabid liberal by Victorian England's standards as he held that the different between \"civilised\" and \"savage\" peoples were like the difference between tame and wild animal. This was way short of the right wing christian view of the time that held that the \"savages\" were created differently.\n \n \nMany indigenous peoples died because of Darwinian evolution, so don't give me such rubbish that Darwin never did a theory of human evolution.\nMany people died because racists hijacked the theory of evolution to further their own ends.\n \n \nPerhaps you best go home and check up on your own theory before you post such a remark. And people think that creationists are mis-informed!\nWhatever.\n \n \nOnce again, falsehood. If a theory is equivalent to fact, than why do they have two different things. In science, using you above example, gravity is a fact (I don't think that there is a theory of gravity, at least it is not in the HSC Physics course when we were studying it!).\nWe know far less about how gravity works that about how evolution works. Yet you call gravity \"fact\", and evolution \"theory\"? There are some big holes in gravity theory, in that it doesn't appear to work \"properly\" at large scales. Yet it's fact you say? I'm amazed at the idea that you do not know about gravity theory. Type it into google and educate yourself.\n \n \nBy definition, a theory is an explanation of observed facts and laws. It is supported by experiments upon which it is based, and is confirmed by experiments designed to test predictions based on the explanation. Now where in that definition is the word fact either used or implied?\nBecause when something passes every experiment thrown at it and when something fits observation better than anything else, then it's as near as damnit fact. We can get pedantic over this if you want, but the conclusion that reaches is that there are no facts.\n \n \n You mis-interpretation of scientific terms is noted.\nRather than \"noting\" it, learn from me: you confuse hypothesis and theory; you confuse scientific theories with non scientific theories.\n \n \nI agree with your definition of faith. Bible believing creationists must take it by faith that there is a God, and that the Bible is the Inspired Word of God. Evolutionists (for the most part, i.e. most are atheistic), however, must take it by blind faith that there is no God and that the Bible is not the Inspired Word of God.\nWrong. Since the vaste majority of religious people accept evolution over blind faith in contradictory creation stories within their religious texts, it's highly unlikly that most \"Evolutionists\" are atheistic. Secondly, you fail to understand what atheism is. It's a lack of faith. There might be a god and the bible might be the \"Inspired Word of God\", but there is no evidence of either therefore it makes no sense to believe either. That is an atheist position: it is sans faith.\n \n \nYour last sentence struck me as to how brainwashed some (or many people) are in the lie of evolution (microorganism into people evolution). For one, evolutionists must take it by blind faith that stuff has evolved, i.e. there is very few fossils that support this notion.\nUntrue. We have more transitional fossils than we know what to do with. We are awash with transitional fossils. Oh and if you are going to quote books to support your false claims about the fossil record, how about quoting ones written less than 30 years ago eh? \n \n \nWhat they are saying is that the fossil record does not show evolution\nAnd they are wrong.\n \n \nFour words that always gets an evolutionist into trouble, \"Evolution has been proven\".\nReally? I don't see myself in trouble for saying them. I stand by them, for they are truthful words.\n \n \n If you refer to what you call \"micro-evolution\" (to which creationists call \"Varriation within a \"kind\"\") than I would agree with you.\nMicro evolution and and \"variation within 'kind'\" are two different things. The latter is some nonsense made up by creationists that contains nonsense about loss of information and \"devolution\". Its about as scientific as sesame street. The former is the study of the effects of variation in genetic composition of interbreeding populations over time.\n \n \nSpecies change all of the time, but it is important to know that the species never get more complex, they are constantly losing gentic information (i.e. DNA) and becoming less complex.\nUtter rubbish. Mutations can result in the increase or decrease in genetic information. You are just making this up now!\n \n \nCreation has not been disproven, as you falsely claim. Otherwise, the evolutionists here on this forum would be able to hammer the creationist arguments, and thus far they have not.\nHave you read any of this forum? The creationists are hammered into a squelchy mess on every single occasion! They have no evidence to back up their position, and very little knowledge of the subject, so lose every time. I'm shocked that you would claim otherwise.",

   "Two facts that have been asserted in error:\n \nDarwin never produced a \"Theory of Human Evolution\".\n\n He most certainly did.\n \nDarwin's book titled \"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life\" sure seems to me to suggest that he had an idea on the evolution of man.\n\n Doesn't matter what it seems to you. Have you read the book? If you had you would find that Darwin didn't discuss the evolution of humans in that book. He did discuss races of cabbage and pigeons. Darwin's \"races\" are now referred to as species.\n \nDarwinian evolution was (and still is) inherently a racist philosophy, teaching that different groups or \"races\" of people evolved at different times and rates, so some groups are more like their ape-like ancestors than others.\n\n Really? Then cite Darwin's works to support you assertion. I am sure that you would not make such an assertion if you had not read Darwin's books. But on the other hand, you claim the \"On The Origin of Species\" supports your assertions, as if you had actually read it. I have and it doesn't say what you claim. Please cite specific passages.\n \nDarwin believed, for instance, that the Australian Aboriginals were considered the missing links between an ape-like ancestor and the rest of mankind\".\n\n No kidding? Did you get that from your reading of \"On The Origin of Species\"? Please cite specific passages. Your claims indicate that you have read Darwin's works on evolution. Please show that you have done so and support your assertions.\n \nMany indigenous peoples died because of Darwinian evolution, so don't give me such rubbish that Darwin never did a theory of human evolution.\n\n That's a non-sequitur. What does Darwin's theory have to do with the death of any \"indigenous peoples?\" I hope you are aware that Darwin first published \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859. So tell me, specifically which \"Indigenous peoples\" were slaughtered as a result of Darwin's theory. Please compare them the the indigenous people of the Caribbean islands who were wiped out by Christians. Please compare them to the Inca and the Mayan peoples when they encountered Christians. What about the Aztecs? They died to the last child when they encountered Christians.\n \n So the question is, what indigenous peoples died because of Darwinian evolution? I don't think that you know what you are talking about.\n \n By the way, gravity is a theory. Like all scientific theories, it attempts to explain the mechanisms the cause the observations. The thing is that the theory of gravity isn't very well developed - certainly not as well developed as the theory of evolution. We have no idea of why objects fall to earth, while we have a pretty good understanding of why populations change to adapt to the environment.",

   "To Clive14:\n This will be the last time for me on this and any forum as it is an utter waste of time trying to convince others who strongly believe in something else of how wrong their beliefs are, this is mainly because they so want to believe in their theory that they become ignorant to science and what the facts imply.\n \n This is a common view held by people who make a half hearted effort to learn about evolution and then promptly think they are experts. Go read the book. You will find that Darwin uses the words \"races\" and \"varieties\" interchangably throughout the book to refer to both plants and animals. You have fallen for a tired old false creationist argument by believing that races\" in the title refers to people only.\n \n No, actually it is view held by those who care to investigate what Darwinism did to society of the day when it came out and became accepted. For two, I did not say that Darwin's book was only about Humans, did I? Races generally refers to humans, and species to animals. And no, there is no such creationist argument that tries to decieve people into believing that Darwin's book is only about Human \"races\". What you have to remember is the big picture, as Christians, creationists are bound by God's Word, which says not to lie. But to atheists, telling the truth is neither right nor wrong, i.e. they have no basis for morality.\n \n Untrue. Darwin was a rabid liberal by Victorian England's standards as he held that the different between \"civilised\" and \"savage\" peoples were like the difference between tame and wild animal.\n \n Actually, anything that was not European (i.e. used agriculture and built permenant houses for examples) was considered \"savages\" (i.e. Natives). \n \n Many people died because racists hijacked the theory of evolution to further their own ends.\n \n Arguably, I might agree with you. But when Darwin published his ideas, it fuelled racism. Now, Darwinism/evolutionism is not the cause of racism, but it sure fuelled it. Imagine the effect of generations of school kids being told that that \"black fella\" (no offense intended) down the road is an animal, or less of a human being and not as evolved as you, would have! In fact, the Sydney Museum at the start of the turn of the century (1850-1920) listed the Australian Aboriginals as animals. In fact, scientists from Europe sent people to Australia with directions on how to kill the Aboriginals, how to plug the bullets from their head, and how to get them ready to be shown in exhibits around the world as the so-called missing links. The Europeans (heavily under the influence of evolution) shot them, they stabbed them, they herdered them over cliffs, and many other terrible things. All in the name of evolution. The same thing also happened to the Natives of America.\n \n We know far less about how gravity works that about how evolution works. Yet you call gravity \"fact\", and evolution \"theory\"? There are some big holes in gravity theory, in that it doesn't appear to work \"properly\" at large scales. Yet it's fact you say?\n \n Gravity is a fact because we can observe it's effects on objects and we can do tests to determine more about it. A theory is basically a story made up to try and explain an observation. Generally, most theories have the backing of many experiments. Evolution and creation are both stories made up to try and fit with the evidence in order to explain how it and everything got there and why it behaves the way it does. That is it. I could make up a theory based on the evidence (i.e. matches the evidence) to explain how everything got here and it would be just as \"scientific\" as evolution and creation. Microorganisms to man evolution cannot be tested, nor can it be observed. We see varriation within a kind - evidence of creation, i.e. created kinds have diversified over time but they have never improved in complexity. This is backed up by the evidence and observations that we see today. This is also in-line with the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics which says that things have a tendency to run down (i.e. more complex to less complex) unless acted upon by intelligence. In evolutionary theory, there is no God and therefore no intelligence to push this natural trend in the opposite direction.\n \n Because when something passes every experiment thrown at it and when something fits observation better than anything else, then it's as near as damnit fact.\n \n Yes I will agree with you, but evolution has many severe holes in it that at present cannot be explained (such as less complex into more complex organisms). Evolution is not a fact, it is a story designed to explain how we got here and why things behave the way that they do. This is exactly the same as creation.\n \n Rather than \"noting\" it, learn from me: you confuse hypothesis and theory; you confuse scientific theories with non scientific theories.\n \n No, I believe I have the right interpretation of a hypothesis and a theory. A hypothesis is a plausible solution to a problem. It forms the basis for further investigations by which it may be proved or disproved. A theory on the other hand is an explanation of observed facts and laws. It is supported by experiments upon which it is based, and is confirmed by experiments designed to test predictions based on the explanation. \n \n You are missing a vital truth. Evolution is based on a religious view point, the new religion, that of atheism (i.e. a belief in no God). Creation says that there is a God, while evolution says that there is no God. Both require faith for either or them to be true. They are both based on what the person believes to be true about origins. In science however, there is no or little room for personal beliefs, but in evolution, many parts must be taken by faith, such as the big bang and life from non-life and increasing complexity (grouping the whole secular theories as one).\n \n Since the vaste majority of religious people accept evolution over blind faith in contradictory creation stories within their religious texts, it's highly unlikly that most \"Evolutionists\" are atheistic. Secondly, you fail to understand what atheism is. It's a lack of faith. There might be a god and the bible might be the \"Inspired Word of God\", but there is no evidence of either therefore it makes no sense to believe either. That is an atheist position: it is sans faith.\n \n No, they are just replacing faith with blind faith by believing in evolution (especially since microorganism to man evolution is not supported by the evidence). It is a very sad and disturbing trend though. Atheism is a belief in no God, it is a belief system in which no God exists and thus requires blind faith. There is good evidence to suggest both that there is a God and that the Bible is the Inspired Word of God. Firstly, the DNA coding system is good reason to suggest that there must be a \"Designer\" out there. We see a computer program, we know that it must have a designer; and in a similar way, we see the amazingly complex DNA coding system, we must therefore say that by the logical conclusion it needs a programer/designer. Also, our morals/values/ethics and so on are also good evidence to suggest a God, as to is design. The Bible contains many scientific and historic accurate lines in it, see \"Mistrust in Religion\" thread in the Religion forum for more information.\n \n Untrue. We have more transitional fossils than we know what to do with. We are awash with transitional fossils. Oh and if you are going to quote books to support your false claims about the fossil record, how about quoting ones written less than 30 years ago eh?\n \n ROTFLOL! There are many quotes less than 30 years old. In fact, many of the ones that I have were made in the early to late 1980's. Not much has changed since the 1980's - although you can blindly believe that the fossil record supports the belief of evolutionism. The truth is that the fossil record does not support evolution, it is just that you so much want to believe evolution that you are blind to the evidence and will therefore be ignorant when one discusses the evidence. This time, I have the backing of many high profile evolutionists (with their quotes) that dismisses your claims. \n \n And they are wrong.\n \n Woah, just hold on a second. Are you trying to tell me that I should believe you, an evolutionary fanatic, over real evolutionary scientists such as the now deceased Stephen Jay Gould? That just isn't logical.\n \n Really? I don't see myself in trouble for saying them. I stand by them, for they are truthful words.\n \n In your point of view. \"Many of the truths that we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.\" ~ Obi-Wan. This is examplified here.\n \n Micro evolution and and \"variation within 'kind'\" are two different things. The latter is some nonsense made up by creationists that contains nonsense about loss of information and \"devolution\". Its about as scientific as sesame street. The former is the study of the effects of variation in genetic composition of interbreeding populations over time.\n \n This just illustrates your limited knowledge on opposing theories. Varriation within a kind is real, in fact we observe this happening today and you would be more than a fool if you tried to argue this point (as you would be arguing against micro-evolution). The TNR is an example of varriation with in a kind, so to is beatles without wings. Prime examples of evolution is actually best described as \"varriation within a kind\", such as antibiotic resistance of germs. This is - apart from contrary belief - devolution. The bug or germ has lost genetic information (in all cases) and thus because of the loss of an ability it has become resistant to the antibiotic. Natural selection and mutations enables the diversification and varriation within a kind. It is the same thing (just that varriation within a kind would be limited by downhill genetic changes - or reshufflment of genes - but this fits in nicely with the evidence as there is not one situation that one can point to - that holds up to scruitny - that can be seen to increase the genetic information content). So since there is no mutation that can be seen to increase the amount of genetic information content, micro-evolution is the same as varriation within a kind. Just a different name.\n \n Utter rubbish. Mutations can result in the increase or decrease in genetic information. You are just making this up now!\n \n Actually no. This is a proven scientific fact thus far. Dr Lee Spetner (who is a highly qualified Israeli biophysicist)demolishes the NeoDarwinian belief that mutations can add the information needed for real evolution. Spetner in his book \"Not by Chance\" shows in clear, understandable detail that genuine point mutations are all, without exception, losses of information. In otherwords, there is not one genuine point mutation (when studied on the molecular level) that increases the genetic information in the genome. So no, I was not making this up. It is fact. \n \n Have you read any of this forum? The creationists are hammered into a squelchy mess on every single occasion! They have no evidence to back up their position, and very little knowledge of the subject, so lose every time. I'm shocked that you would claim otherwise.\n \n Generally when evolutionists can't deal with the evidence they become violent and out comes the insults. They often attack character when they either can't or won't deal with the evidence. Of course, not all evolutionists are like this, but this forum is a testamony to many doing exactly this. Otherwise, they won't deal with the evidence, i.e. they will ignore the evidence, this has happened a few times too. Creationists do have evidence to back up their position and they do have knowledge on the subject that they are arguing about. And no, they do not lose everytime. In fact, recently Dr Carl Wieland was challanged to a debate by some ABC skeptic of the year on creation V evolution. Accordingly it was a tough battle, but of those who filled out the survey at the end of the debate (ignoring those who said that they were overtely Christian or evolutionists before the debate) Dr Carl Wieland came out on top by I think from memory around 10-20ish%.",

   "To Ursus maritimus:\n This is because creationism is not a well-defined, well-thought out theory.\n \n Actually, creation is based directly on the Bible. Creation theory basically says that God made the universe and all that is in it in six literal days about 6,000 years ago. Shortly after creation when Adam rebelled and sinned against God, God placed a curse on the whole creation. He subjected it to decay (which is what Adam through his actions asked for, i.e. a life without God) as He lifted some of His sustaining powers over His creation and let the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics effects (more complex into less complex, i.e. things running down) take hold. Suffering and death entered the world. Harmful mutations started to take hold and degrade species even more and diversify the Biblical kinds at a faster rate than what would have happened before the Fall. After the Fall comes the next biggest thing in history, Noah's Flood. This is where God destroyed 99% of everything that He ever created and only Noah and his family and the creatures they saved on the Ark managed to survive to repopulate the Earth. It is during the Flood when the majority of the worlds fossils and landforms were formed. The retreating Flood waters would have carved out the landscape and features. \"Mountains rose and valleys sank\" as the Bible describes it (after the Flood). We then have the seperation of man. After the Flood the creatures saved began to repopulate the Earth and have some more varriation within the kind aided by natural selection and mutations. The next idea is the seperation of man and the origin of the different languages at Babel. It is here where God confused man's language and than seperated them all over the world. The seperation enabled the Human Race to divsersify as different people adapted to different environments. Than hey presto, we are here at the present. See, no evolution and no hard confusing stuff. Pretty simple theory, would you not concurr?\n \n It makes no predictions that can be falsified. Any world that we live in can be made consistent with creationism.\n \n Actually the Bible provides many situations in which may be proved false. This includes the scientific predictions/verses as can be reviewed in the \"Mistrust in Religion\" in the Religion forum. Apart from this, the Biblical model says that there is only one race, the Human Race; things breed true to their kind (i.e. no macro-evolution); the issues regarding the Flood; 2nd Law of Thermodnyamics; and probably some others.\n \n What would you consider to be proof against creationism?\n \n What would I consider as evidence against creation? Probably, if you could prove the Bible to be inaccurate would be a major issue. Transitional forms, many increasing information genetic mutations to the genome; that life can come from non-lie without intelligence; and basically disprove anything that AiG says.\n \n The closest that relgious fundamentalism comes to science is the Flood. This should have left definite, unambiguous evidence of its occurrence. Despite people posting instances of creatures being buried in marine environments (indeed, most of the fossil record is in marine environments - marine environments have better characteristics for the preservation of fossils than other environments), and instances of catastrophic events, there is no evidence that there was a single Flood occurring world-wide tht drowned representatives of all species at the same period of time. It would be easy to find this \"Flood layer\" in the geologic, heck, in the archaeological record, if it happened.\n \n Remeber that how you interpret the fossil record all depends on your starting assumption (or starting belief system is). Although we are looking at the same evidence, we will come to different conclusions as we start off with different assumptions and beliefs. When as an evolutionist you may not see any evidecne of a Global Flood, once you become a creationist you will see countless examples of a Global Flood. This has happened many times in the past.",

   "To Clive14:\n This will be the last time for me on this and any forum as it is an utter waste of time trying to convince others who strongly believe in something else of how wrong their beliefs are, this is mainly because they so want to believe in their theory that they become ignorant to science and what the facts imply.\nTranslation: \"I'm out of my depth here, but I'm so assine that I'd rather run away than leearn about how I'm wrong\".\n \n Whatever. If you can't take the heat, then getting out the kitchen is wise.\n \n \nNo, actually it is view held by those who care to investigate what Darwinism did to society of the day when it came out and became accepted.\nThe society Darwin lived in was already racist. To suggest that the theory of evolution caused that racism is an outrageous lie.\n \n \nFor two, I did not say that Darwin's book was only about Humans, did I? Races generally refers to humans, and species to animals.\nToday, this is true. Darwin's book offers clear evidence that \"race\" was used to describe both plant and animal varieties (not species!) in Darwin's day.\n \n \nAnd no, there is no such creationist argument that tries to decieve people into believing that Darwin's book is only about Human \"races\". What you have to remember is the big picture, as Christians, creationists are bound by God's Word, which says not to lie. But to atheists, telling the truth is neither right nor wrong, i.e. they have no basis for morality.\nSadly if only this were true. Any examination of creationists websites, for example, will reveal them to be a huge bunch of liars. yet they call themselves Christian. And cut the **** about atheists not having morality please. Morality isn't an absolute and it isn't solely owned by Christians.\n \n \nMany people died because racists hijacked the theory of evolution to further their own ends.\n \n Arguably, I might agree with you. But when Darwin published his ideas, it fuelled racism. Now, Darwinism/evolutionism is not the cause of racism, but it sure fuelled it. Imagine the effect of generations of school kids being told that that \"black fella\" (no offense intended) down the road is an animal, or less of a human being and not as evolved as you,\nThis is a strawman. The kids of the time already viewed the \"black fella\" as an animal. You try to paint a completely untrue image of Europeans getting on just fine with other people, then along comes Darwin and the Europeans start seeing them as savages and animals. This is utterly untrue.\n \n \nGravity is a fact because we can observe it's effects on objects and we can do tests to determine more about it.\nAnd some of those tests fail. There are holes in the theory of gravity. Yet gravity remains fact in simple every day terms. Evolution is fact because \"we can observe it's effects on objects and we can do tests to determine more about it\". Further there are very few holes in that theory. Evolution is therefore more deserving of being called fact than gravity is. \n \n What I think you are really trying to say is that you can think you understand gravity (drop ball; ball falls) therefore you see it as a fact. But evolution is complex even at a basic level, so you do not see it as fact.\n \n \nA theory is basically a story made up to try and explain an observation.\nStop lying please. I have explained to you what a scientific theory is. Continuing to falsely claim it's something else makes you a liar.\n \n \nGenerally, most theories have the backing of many experiments. \nAnd there are thousands upon thousands of experiments that back evolution. Clearly you haven't bothered to look at any of them.\n \n [more creationist lies snipped for they are getting tedious]\n \n \nYes I will agree with you, but evolution has many severe holes in it that at present cannot be explained (such as less complex into more complex organisms).\nUntrue.\n \n \nEvolution is not a fact, it is a story designed to explain how we got here and why things behave the way that they do. This is exactly the same as creation.\nYawn. Yet more lies.\n \n \nNo, I believe I have the right interpretation of a hypothesis and a theory.\nThen I apologise. You are not a liar: you are simply assinine.\n \n \nYou are missing a vital truth. Evolution is based on a religious view point\nMore lies/ assine nonsense (I know not which now).\n \n \nAtheism is a belief in no God, it is a belief system in which no God exists and thus requires blind faith.\nIt so amuses me when a non atheist tries to tell me, an atheist, what atheism is. It's very funny as they haven't a clue and always seem to need to claim it's a faith based position (which is the absolute opposite of reality).\n \n \nThere is good evidence to suggest both that there is a God and that the Bible is the Inspired Word of God.\nPlease do prvide it then.\n \n \nFirstly, the DNA coding system is good reason to suggest that there must be a \"Designer\" out there.\nWrong.\n \n \nWe see a computer program, we know that it must have a designer; and in a similar way, we see the amazingly complex DNA coding system, we must therefore say that by the logical conclusion it needs a programer/designer.\nSorry you lost me at the \"we must therefore say\" bit. We must do no such thing. If one is desperate to find evidence, I could understand why this would seem like a straw to grasp, but to anyone unencumbered by faith and dogma, there is no reason, \"logical\" or otherwise, to see DNA as designed.\n \n \nAlso, our morals/values/ethics and so on are also good evidence to suggest a God, as to is design.\nNope, you have lost me there. How are \"morals/values/ethics\" evidence of your particular god (or any god come to that)?\n \n \nThe Bible contains many scientific and historic accurate lines in it, see \"Mistrust in Religion\" thread in the Religion forum for more information.\nAnd it contains many scientific and historic inaccurate lines in it. What was your point?\n \n \nROTFLOL! There are many quotes less than 30 years old.\nThen provide them!\n \n \nIn fact, many of the ones that I have were made in the early to late 1980's. Not much has changed since the 1980's\nNo dear. Not much has changed, he says. Guess we had best break it to the world that all the advances in genetics of the last 20 years for example are worthless. Pathetic!\n \n \nalthough you can blindly believe that the fossil record supports the belief of evolutionism.\nI do not need to blindly believe it. There is ample evidence to remove the need for belief. It's a bit like me not blindly believing the sun \"rose\" this morning.\n \n \nThe truth is that the fossil record does not support evolution\nThis is getting stupid. Why am I wasting my time with you?\n \n [rest snipped as it's getting depressing wasting my time replying to such ill-educated nonsense]",

   "Hello, Rogue, and good-bye. A pity you may not read this response. But I suppose that I should respond, for the lurkers if for no other reason.\n \n First, let me comment on something you said to Clive14:\n \nThis will be the last time for me on this and any forum as it is an utter waste of time trying to convince others who strongly believe in something else of how wrong their beliefs are, this is mainly because they so want to believe in their theory that they become ignorant to science and what the facts imply.\n\n I'm sorry that you feel you need to convince others of anything. What I enjoy about these message boards is the exchange of ideas. I enjoy finding out what others think, and why. I also learn a lot from the debates - the discussions force me to do a little research, and I often learn new things. It's a pity that you don't feel that you have anything to learn, and that we have nothing to contribute to your learning.\n \n On the other hand, I find this pretty hypocritical. Everytime anyone tries to convince you of anything, you claim that atheists are liars, or that evidence can be interpreted differently. You are the one coming off as ignorant about science and facts. I don't think anyone can convince you of anything.\n \n \n \nThe same thing also happened to the Natives of America.\n\n As an American, let me assure you that the Native Americans were being robbed, murdered, and treated as animals long before Darwin.\n \n \n \nBut to atheists, telling the truth is neither right nor wrong, i.e. they have no basis for morality.\n\n So, whenever anyone tells you something you don't want to believe, they are lying atheists. How far do you think that attitude is going to get you in life? And what about Christians who accept evolution? Are they lying? What about Christians who do scientific research that confirms evolution? Are they lying? To go back to the first statement I quoted, when you dismiss all the evidence we bring up as lies, how are we supposed to convince you of anything? Or is this just a one-way street? It is our duty to be convinced by you?\n \n \n \n To me:\n \nActually, creation is based directly on the Bible.\n\n The point is that it is not a scientific theory. You cannot make predictions about based on it.\n \n \n \nActually the Bible provides many situations in which may be proved false.\n\n So, give a prediction, based soley on the Bible, that can be verified or falsified.\n \n \n \n \nProbably, if you could prove the Bible to be inaccurate would be a major issue.\n\n One issue is the global flood. If there were a global flood, there should be unambiguous signs of it. There aren't. That is the biggest inaccuracy that I can think of. But you don't want to hear about it. Any evidence I could give is either a lie or a misinterpretation. You have already indicated that you simply regard any evidence against your beliefs as a lie.\n \n \n \n \nTransitional forms,\n\n These exist in abundance. But you will just claim they are a lie.\n \n \n \nmany increasing information genetic mutations to the genome;\n\n These have been seen. But you will just claim that this is a lie.\n \n \n \n \nthat life can come from non-lie without intelligence;\n\n Why? What does this have to do with evolution of present and past species? Or radiometric dating?\n \n \n \n \nand basically disprove anything that AiG says.\n\n TalkOrigins.org. But you have already dismissed them as liars. We cannot disprove anything AiG says, because when we do, you dismiss it as a lie.\n \n \n \nRemeber that how you interpret the fossil record all depends on your starting assumption (or starting belief system is). Although we are looking at the same evidence, we will come to different conclusions as we start off with different assumptions and beliefs.\n\n Your honor, people claim they have seen me drinking in a bar. The police claims to have seen my car weaving in traffic. The tests showed that my blood alcohol lever was .15. But I maintain that this is merely an interpretation of the evidence, and that the charges of drunken driving be dismissed.\n \n Try that one and see how far it gets you.\n \n \n \n \nThis forum is starting to get a little bit boring and is using up to much of my time.\n\n So, we on this board aren't receptive to your proselytizing? Sorry about that. This particular forum is intended to be a scientific discussion, based on logic and evidence. We certainly don't want to waste your time. The door is over there. I find your dismissive, superior attitude to be offensive, to be honest., so I can't say I'll miss you.\n \n But should you ever want to discuss evolution and creation in terms of actual science you will be welcome to return.",

   "Darwin produced the theory of natural selection. That can be used to understand human evolution, but I'm not aware he developed a separate theory of human evolution. Can you provide details?\n\n Well, I seem to have confused you a bit. I pointed out two errors in the discussion, one being your error in stating that Darwin never developed a theory of human evolution, and the other that it was clear that \"On the Origin of Species\" demonstrated that theory because it was racist because of the subtitle of \"Origin\" - \"Or The Preservation Of Favoured Races In The Struggle For Life.\"\n \n First, I'll deal with what I meant that Darwin most certainly did develop a theory of human evolution. You see, even though Darwin didn't discuss human evolution in \"Origin,\" he was quite aware of the implications of his theories. He wanted his theories to be considered without the confusion and emotion that religious dogma would bring to the question and took pains to avoid any mention of the issue in \"Origin.\" However, in 1871 Darwin finally published his view of the theory in \"The Descent Of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex,\" which directly applied his theories to the evolution of mankind, as well as expanding on another of his theories of evolution, that of sexual selection. The reason that Darwin was willing to publish in 1871 what he had avoided for so many years was the the implication of human evolution from Darwin's theories, while not suggested, was obvious and had been discussed almost since 1859. For example, in 1860 Bishop Wilberforce asked T.H. Huxley if he was descended from an ape on his grandfather's side or his grandmother's. Huxley replied that he would rather have an ape for an ancestor than a bishop.\n \n So, yes. Darwin did develop a theory of human evolution, but no, it was not suggested in \"Origin.\" As I mentioned, the issue was painstakingly avoided by Darwin in \"Origin\" in an effort to limit the discussion to scientific considerations.\n \n But Rogue790 claimed that Darwin's book, \"On the Origin of Species\" suggested to him that Darwin had an idea about human evolution. He further claims that the book is racist because of the use of the word \"race\" in the title. It is clear the Rogue790 has never read the book and is unfamiliar with Darwin and his beliefs. Darwin was actually one of the least racist men of his day. To Darwin the word \"race\" meant variety or species. Anyone who has read \"Origin\" is quite aware that Darwin is talking about varieties of pigeons and species of cabbage and the like. He didn't discuss human evolution, much less did he express racist ideas. But those ideas were quite prevelant in Victorian, Christian England.\n \n But Rogue790 wasn't able to respond to any of my questions except with more unsupported assertion. And when examples of Christian racism are pointed out, Rogue790 answers with the \"no true Scot\" argument.\n \n But \"On the Origin of Species\" is more than a statement of the theory of natural selection. In fact, there are at least 5 theories of evolution that are stated in the book that stand and fall on their own, independant of the others.\n \n 1) Evolution as such - the idea that lineages of organisms change over time. An old idea that was reexpressed by Darwin.\n \n 2) Gradualism - the idea that differences between populations of organisms accumulate by a series of innumerable small steps through intermediate forms. Darwin's original idea.\n \n 3) Population Speciation - Another idea that was original with Darwin. Individual organisms do not evolve and offspring are not different species from their parents. Evolution is a process that occurs in the heritable characteristics of a population over time. Remarkable when you consider that Darwin knew nothing of genetics.\n \n 4) Common descent - Darwin was the first to argue that species had diverged from common ancestors and thus comprise a great tree of life.\n \n 5) Natural selection - Also developed by, and published concurrently with Wallace. This is the theory of differential reproductive success. Darwin resisted the application of sociologist Herbert Spencer's phrase, \"survival of the fittest\" to his theories. Darwin didn't use it until the 4th edition of \"Origin\" and then always follwed it with \"or natural selection\".\n \n By the way, for those who would like to know what Darwin said without actually reading Darwin, I suggest reading Darwin's Ghost: The Origin of Species Updated by Steve Jones. I have always found Darwin's Victorian languages ponderous at best. The above book uses modern examples to illustrate Darwin's ideas. Of course, as is true with any book on evolutionary theory, this one only scratches the surface.",
