   "First guppies, now lizards\n \n You know...this is just too dang easy. \n \n I have indeed unlocked the secret code of deception of the scietific underworld. It's an ugly place where the facts are concealed by complete and utter nonsense. It's a sleight-of-hand maneuver that all of science is evidently in on...and it's a tactic that Satan himself would be proud of.\n \n See, here's the trick.....scientists have a beautiful little scam set up: \n \n What they report to the public is often completley different than what is shown in the scientific papers. What's shown on the front page of USA Today often reads much different than what reads in a 13-page PDF file that's only meant for pre-brainwashed scientific eyes. Since they assume that much of the public is not yet sufficiently brainwashed -- nor smart enough to comprehend \"real\" science -- they give them the pro-darwin version.\n \n Lizard experiment suggests rapid evolution\n \n http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/evol/lizard.html\n \n First it's guppies...now it's lizzards.\n \n I told you evolutionists that whenever science studies animals closely that real biology dismantles their beloved theory. That's why there's so few documented studies like this. \n \n But in this case, scientists have discovered when the environment changes that lizzards' limb length changes with it. Of course, since they are dead-set against reporting the truth to the public, these guys just make stuff up. Check this first paragraph out...\n \n http://www.txtwriter.com/Onscience/Articles/losos.html\n \n Darwin can rest a little easier tonight. I'm sure he would have been puzzled at the average American's reluctance to accept his theory of evolution. The evidence supporting Darwin's theory is clear, and every year more supporting evidence accumulates. \n \n Please.\n \n Anyway, we're talking about lizard legs:\n \n One of the specializations of lizards noted by scientists over the years has been that lizards that inhabit large trees tend to have long legs, whereas those lizards that live on twig-like plants have short legs.\n \n The experiment involved the introduction of one species of lizard to fourteen small, lizard-free Caribbean island near the Exumas in the Bahamas. The lizards were left for fourteen years. The original intent of the experiment was to study extinction. The experiment, started by Thomas Schoener of the University of California at Davis, would have provided scientists with important information as they observed the extinction of the introduced lizards. Unfortunately, the lizards adapted to their new environments, and the focus of the experiment changed to study this rapid evolution. \n \n Ok.... So what was supposed to be an experiment on extinction/DEATH -- ie natural selection -- turned out to be an observation of how God made animals individually adapative to environmental shifts. What a LETDOWN for the death-obsessed scientific community!\n \n \n Losos and his colleagues report in the journal Nature that the lizards evolved in the direction as predicted. Those with the shortest legs are found on islands with the scrubbiest vegetation.\n \n Of course what the evolutionists just assume -- and report -- is that the lizards evolved via darwinian natural selection.\n \n But GUESS WHAT????????\n \n It seems if one digs below the surface just a little bit that they can get the actual truth buried underneath.....which tells us that these lizards actually are simply exhibiting plasticity upon an environemental shift: (different site/different study)\n \n http://www.medscape.com/medline/abstract/10937208 \n \n Species of Anolis lizards that use broad substrates have long legs, which provide enhanced maximal sprint speed, whereas species that use narrow surfaces have short legs, which permit careful movements. We raised hatchling A. sagrei in terraria provided with only broad or only narrow surfaces. At the end of the experiment, lizards in the broad treatment had relatively longer hindlimbs than lizards in the narrow treatment. These results indicate that not only is hindlimb length a plastic trait in these lizards, but that this plasticity leads to the production of phenotypes appropriate to particular environments. Comparison to hindlimb lengths of other Anolis species indicates that the range of plasticity is limited compared to the diversity shown throughout the anole radiation. Nonetheless, this plasticity potentially could have played an important role in the early stages of the Caribbean anole radiation.\n \n Yet, in the article meant for public consumption...these scientists are so desperate to brainwash the unsuspecting public that they try to confuse them by giving them only two choices pick from -- neither of which is the way lizards REALLY evolve new traits.\n \n \n hypothesis A -- lizards migrated between the islands. A specialist anole like the one that lives in grass may have evolved only once, but then travelled to the other islands, perhaps on floating driftwood. If this is true, the similarity of communities is not the result of evolution repeating itself, but just a matter of specialists finding their way to the habitats they prefer.\n \n hypothesis B -- lizards evolved in parallel on the four islands. The anole communities on the four islands may have evolved their similarity independently, evolution taking the same course again and again. \n \n I guess they finally decided on hypothesis B...\n \n Has evolution repeated itself? Yes. The DNA data are clear-cut: specialist species on one island are not closely related to the same specialists elsewhere, and are closely related to other anoles inhabiting the same island. Hypothesis B is correct. The four lizard communities evolved independently to be similar to one another.\n \n Of course I'm surprised they would admit this because that would clearly point to the fact that all the lizards evolved plastically at the same time according to the same environmental cues. Yet the Losos research team gets an award:\n \n Last night Losos received the St. Louis Academy of Science's \"2001 Innovation Award,\" given to a young scientist under age 40 for highly innovative work. It is an honor I am sure Darwin would applaud.\n \n \n They may get an award here on earth...but I have a feeling they're in for a different kind of \"reward\" when they look their maker in the eye.\n \n But this just goes to show how simple plasticity can give the ILLUSION of evolution. \n \n But do you remember THIS comment?:\n \n Darwin can rest a little easier tonight. I'm sure he would have been puzzled at the average American's reluctance to accept his theory of evolution. The evidence supporting Darwin's theory is clear, and every year more supporting evidence accumulates. \n \n What does plasticity have to do with Darwin? \n \n And by the way...this same exact thing can be seen with Reznick's guppies: The article meant for public consumption states that the guppies evolved via natural selection -- yet in his scientific PDF file, Reznick says the guppies were exhibiting phenotypic plasticity -- yet there's no mention of plasticity in the article.\n \n You know what I think? I think the scientific community is full of corruption. There ain't no doubt about it in my mind.",
