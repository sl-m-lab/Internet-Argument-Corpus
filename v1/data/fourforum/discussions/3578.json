   "The opinion of the rest of the world matters\n \n The simplistic view offered up by many in America is that they don't care about what the rest of the world thinks about the US. They see that going alone, doing what we want, when we want, to whomever we want, and damn the consequences is a noble practice. Granted, that attitude is beneficial at times, but this is not one of those times. \n \n Why you ask does the opinion of the rest of the world matter? \n \n Let's consider the basics of our modern needs. Much of our lifestyle comes not from the US, but from other places such as Japan, China, Mexico, and Europe, just to name a few. We trade with them to obtain products we want, and we trade them products they want. It is the basic economic principal that voluntary trade creates wealth. Now, trade is restricted by tariffs, opinions of peoples in the respective trading countries, and self proclaimed needs. All of these can change, and all of these have drastic results upon trade. Also, we have to remember that nations are similar to temperamental children. Now, a nation that has a good public opinion of you, you usually have good trade, with few barriers. All is good. Now, if that nation dislikes your nation for a number of reasons, they can slap tariffs and other trade barriers on your products, decreasing your wealth, and lowering your standard of living. Now imagine the entire world doing this to one nation. It is called sanctions, and if it goes far enough, an embargo. The affects of such can be seen in nations such as Cuba and to a lesser degree Iran. Low standard of living, few variety of resource, poverty, you name it, all of the stuff good economies work to avoid. Public opinion of a populace can force its politicians, whether they like your country or not, to raise barriers to trade and to the extreme sanction you. Keeping a good public opinion in other countries ensures that trade flows relatively smoothly and tariffs aren't raised on the whims of the populace. \n \n Now, let's consider the deeper issue. Nations that dislike each other, regularly raise opposition to each other's interest and endeavors, making each country spend more time, effort, money and lives into getting what it wants, if it can get it at all. Countries that are on cordial relations do not do this except on rare occasions for very, very good reasons. The more powerful a nation, the more opposition it can raise, and the more nations, the greater the opposition. Basically the weak can band together to bring down the strong, as we have seen time and time again in this world's history. This occurs to all powerful nations and empires, whether internally, externally or a combination of the two. Either way, helping along the process that will make life harder for you, your nation and your fellow citizens is not the path one wants to take, not to mention accelerating the probability of uniting the weak against you into a strong military or economic alliance. \n \n This attitude not only makes our interest much harder to obtain, our lives more expensive, our quality of living lower, but it places in jeopardy now long we will continue in our current state. Ultimately, you have the right to say what you want, but it is you who will bear the consequences of your comments.",
