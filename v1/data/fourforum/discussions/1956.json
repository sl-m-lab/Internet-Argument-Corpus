Spoken in the temple in Jerusalem, just three days before Jesus, God's Son, was killed. This illustration, too, was in answer to the question about the source of Jesus' authority. (Mr 11:27-33) Immediately after the illustration, the Gospel accounts state that the religious leaders realized that he was speaking about them.-Mt 21:45; Mr 12:12; Lu 20:19.\n The fence around the vineyard might have been of stone (Pr 24:30, 31) or it might have been a hedge. (Isa 5:5) The wine vat was frequently excavated in the rock and consisted of two levels, the juice flowing from the upper one to the lower. The tower was a lookout place for the guard, who was to keep out thieves and animals. In some cases, the cultivators employed received a certain portion of the fruits. In other cases, the cultivators paid rent in money or agreed to give the owner a definite amount of the produce, the latter apparently being the case in the illustration. By murdering the son, the heir, they may have thought to seize the vineyard as their own, since the one who planted it was out of the country. In Isaiah 5:1-7 \"the vineyard of Jehovah\" is said to be \"the house of Israel.\" As shown by the Gospel writers, Jesus quoted Psalm 118:22, 23 as a key to understanding the illustration.\n \n Since Jehovah left the vineyard in the hands of the Jews and they murdered the son that means it was the Jews surely that were responsible, Satan was just the instigator, although he is to blame overall, the Jews still had free will.",
