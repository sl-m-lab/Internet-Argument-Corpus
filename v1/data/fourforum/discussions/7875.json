   "I ran across this http://www.expressgaynews.com/2006/4-1/view/editorial/crain.cfm I find it intresting that on one hand bush and his religious right backers want to impose \"Judeo-Christian morals\" into American law but on the other are outraged when Muslims want to impose Islamic law in a country that is majority muslim. They want to blur the line between chruch and state here but want strict separation in other countries.\n\n \n I think you need to read the following: \n \n Charlotte Kates is a pro-terrorist law student at Rutgers Univ. who organized the pro-Palestinian conference and defends suicide bombers... \n \n The following letter was written to the President of Rutgers State University by an Israeli citizen after reading Kates' published comments on the Israeli/Palestinian situation!! \n \n Dear Ms. Kates, \n \n I think you are a remarkable woman. You are neither an Arab nor a Jew, you do not study the Middle East, or any associated subject and, correct me if I am wrong, you have never visited this region. Therefore I am somewhat astounded at your expertise and your comments on Israel being an \"Apartheid\" state. \n \n I have lived in Israel for many years and I would be delighted to take you on a little virtual tour of our country. Let me first give you a couple of minor points. Israel occupies 0.1% of the landmass of the Middle East and it is the only Jewish state, not only in this region, surrounded as we are by 22 Arab states, but in the world. \n \n Let us begin your virtual tour!! You have already been through immigration at Tel Aviv Airport with your boyfriend, whom we shall call Ken. You will have filled out a visitors form. This form will not ask you, as it will in many of the countries that surround us, what is your religion, and it will certainly not ask you, as they do in Saudi Arabia, for a \"certificate of religion\". \n \n The day is Sunday! You will want to attend a church service. No problem in the Apartheid State of Israel. We tolerate and freely allow worship for all religions. This is more than can be said for nearly all of the surrounding 22 Arab nations. In fact many of them would not even have a single church, let alone a synagogue. \n \n After a lovely service you and Ken would head for a leisurely lunch, maybe at one of the lovely beachfront restaurants in Tel Aviv. You would most likely have returned to your hotel and put on a very casual outfit, as fitting the very hot Israeli summers. This could be a pair of shorts and a tight-fitting skimpy t-shirt. No problem in the Apartheid state of Israel. In Israel we allow freedom of dress, especially for women, who are not made to wear bulky long robes, a veil to cover their face, and, wouldn't it be a pity if you had to cover that lovely coiffed hairdo, as you would probably have to in most of the surrounding 22 Arab states. \n \n During lunch Ken could gaze lovingly into your heavily painted eyes, complete with a good application of black mascara. He would be free to lean across and kiss your lips, finely painted with lip liner, 2 shades of burgundy lipstick and gloss. People would probably think you were in love, especially as Ken has proudly displayed a good wine on the table. Public displays of affection and consuming alcohol in the Apartheid state of Israel is nothing unusual and its not even scorned upon. That's more than can be said for most of the surrounding 22 Arab states, where your glossy lips would be considered whorish and alcohol is forbidden. \n \n But Ken, being a little flirtatious, pinched one of the young waitresses while you went to reapply your lipstick. It was harmless and, luckily for the young girl in the Apartheid State of Israel, her father and 6 brothers will not take her to the family pool in the evening and drown her, as they would in some of the surrounding 22 Arab states. \n \n After lunch you and Ken drive around. You are even allowed to drive. It is not forbidden in Israel. You stumble across a kindergarten. The children are running around and enjoying themselves. They are not made to sit for hours reciting by rote pages from religious books. Their games are in the sand pit or on the swings. They are not infested with hate or told the only honor to their lives will be in death. In the Apartheid state of Israel we rejoice in life and living. We do not promote murder and violence by brainwashing our children with hatred, as they do in many of the surrounding 22 Arab states. \n \n By the end of the day you and Ken come across a political rally. Many thousands have turned up. In the Apartheid State of Israel all the citizens, men, women, Jew; Arab and Christian are free to vote. We are allowed to openly criticize the government. And our media, including the T.V. and newspapers offer, without prejudice, a choice of opinions. Every person has the right to openly agree with or condemn the government. This can certainly not be said for most of the surrounding 22 Arab states, ruled as they are by oppressive dictators, where any dissent is met with dire consequences. \n \n Of course, most of the 22 surrounding Arab countries can't offer you a good old-fashioned homicide bombing as a tourist attraction. This can only happen in the apartheid state of Israel, surrounded as we are, by so many hostile countries determined, as you are, to wipe us off the face of the earth. Where else can you get on a crowded bus, often packed with children and come face to face with some poor, plighted Palestinian ghoul who thinks life isn't very jolly, having been fed and brainwashed by evil organizations like Hamas, to believe that the only way forward is to murder innocent people? This dehumanized creature will have been fed on a 24/7 diet of lies and hate incitement, he will have been coaxed with the reward of 72 vestal virgins waiting for him in Paradise. His demonic mother will be dancing in the street waving her $10,000 check. \n \n While Israelis are scraping their dead children off the sidewalks, the Palestinians will be lighting fireworks and dancing in the street, to honor this mass murderer as a hero, often to their children who are being systematically nurtured to be the next generation of mass murderers. \n \n The Apartheid state of Israel? Forgive me Ms. Kates but you seem somewhat confused as to the meaning of the word. It usually refers to segregation. It's funny isn't it that a large section of the Jews who live in this apartheid state had to flee for their lives from nearly all of the surrounding 22 Arab states. These countries not only have no tolerance for Jews, they refer to anyone who is not a Moslem as an Infidel and an enemy. I find it somewhat curious that you find nothing \"apartheid\" about these countries. Maybe you should do a project on how many churches there are in Saudi Arabia. Let me help you - there are none. It would not be tolerated. \n \n I am proud to live in this Apartheid State. In 55 years we have become one of the most technologically advanced nations on this planet, with many innovations that have made Israel a true leader in many fields. It is tragic that we have to live in a region that feels threatened by our achievements. \n \n Israel is not an apartheid state and it is appalling that a so-called intelligent and thinking person like you can go around finding feeble excuses for mass murder. \n \n Ms. Kates there is no justification, in any society, for getting on a crowded bus, often packed with children, detonating an explosive belt, often packed with nails and shrapnel, and destroying innocent lives. This is not a freedom fighter, or a person seeking justice, but a chronically and irreversibly evil human being. I can only assume that one day in the near future Ms. Kates, you will chip off that heavy layer of make up and discover your conscience. \n \n Signed: Martin R. Taubman, D.P.M., M.B.",

   "Shall we have a look at some older countries? I believe there has been a parliament at or near Wesminster since the 13th century, and similar bodies dating back to Saxon times and the reign of Alfred the Great. Limiting it to \"constitutional republics\" is a bit dubious, given how many long lasting constitutional monarchies there are around the place. It's also worth pointing out that you had a large civil war in the middle of the 19th century, hardly the indicator of a stable society.\n\n \n \n The civil war was caused by a flaw in the system that the founders knew about. They realized that they could not put together a nation unless they compromised. As the country grew the flaw became bigger until compromises no longer worked and the flaw tore the country apart. There are several other flaws built into the system, such as the electoral college, the winner takes all philosophy, and no directly written out rights. These things have the potential to once again tear the country apart.",

   "Think about those things that are contrary to God's law: Murder would be okay; theft okay; lying and deception across the board okay; adultery the law of the land, and all those things. Such a country would eventually self-destruct, or be overthrown by someone else.\n\n \n There have been countless societies throughout history (and prehistory) who never heard of your god's law. Every one of them had laws against murder and theft, and tightly adhered-to conventions on lying, deception and sex outside marriage.\n \n Can you say 'false dichotomy'? I knew you could.",

   " (Christian Cross necklace on a school teacher) Inaproprate in a secular society if kept hidden would be fine or if the teacher had a necklace from all religions that would be ok\n\n \n You lose. The courts have already ruled against your view on this.\n \n \nHow many children have blown thier brains out with fire arms in general. Unless youi support children killing themselves or someone else.\n\n \n How many babies have been butchered in their mother's wombs via abortion? \n \n \nReligion has no place in a secluar school if you want your children to do bible studies go to church. Besides many of these bible study groups teach children to hate gay people.\n\n \n Nonsense. And the courts have upheld Bible Study groups in schools (after hours) as long as other student groups are also using the facilities. It's called equal access.\n \n \nIf someone smokes everyone around them smokes. However most people who smoke marajuna do so in thier homes and do not force others to breathe their smoke. Unlike cigarette smokers.\n\n \n If your attempts to legalize marijuana were successful, then there wouldn't be much difference in what you just posted above.\n \n \nI don't need my tax dollars going to religious schools were the children will be taught to hate me.\n\n \n <flush< \n \n After watching the radical gays in San Francisco calling Christian protestors all sorts of names in a recent gathering at city hall, I wonder who's really doing the hating. \n \n \nWhat like school lunch program? You must lkike to make children suffer and go hungry.\n\n \n You want to copulate and create a child, you pay for it. It's called personal responsibility. I'm not taking your child to raise. \n \n \nProlifers have no business interfereing with a womans right to control her body.\n\n \n It's called a protest, which is constitutionally protected, and your attemps to use the RICO Racketeering Statute to discriminate against pro-lifers was shot down by the courts. You lost.",

   "Inaproprate in a secular society if kept hidden would be fine or if the teacher had a necklace from all religions that would be ok\nHow so? It is a symbol of personal belief. It is not an attempt at indoctrination. Out of interest, what would you consider it to be OK for a teacher to wear: A Peace sign? A rainbow? A Union Flag (or Stars and Stripes in the US?) A political party's logo? An anarchy symbol? A marijuana leaf?\n \n \nReligion has no place in a secluar school if you want your children to do bible studies go to church. Besides many of these bible study groups teach children to hate gay people.\nReligion has every place in school. A school's position is to educate. Education on different religions is vital. I agree that schools should not officially indoctronate in a particular religion. But where is the harm in 'club' or student group?\n \n \n \nIf someone smokes everyone around them smokes. However most people who smoke marajuna do so in thier homes and do not force others to breathe their smoke. Unlike cigarette smokers.\nI disagree, but not strongly enough to really argue the point.\n \n \n \nI don't need my tax dollars going to religious schools were the children will be taught to hate me.\nDon't think we have this in the UK, so I don't know.\n \n \n \nWhat like school lunch program? You must lkike to make children suffer and go hungry.\nAgree to an extent.\n \n \n \nWhat God. The fraise was not thereuntill the 1950's and has no place in a secular society or on money.\nAgreed.\n \n \n \nOh so you think it is ok to discriminate against people? They need to keep thier evil religious beliefs to themselves.\nHeh. The best diversity course I've been on through work was religious diversity, which of course would totally disagree with that statement!\n \n \n \nIf nesesary yes. Prolifers have no business interfereing with a womans right to control her body.\nPeople have the right to demonstrate. Full stop.\n \n \nSo do I get a chance to protest or vote against your marriage? Do I get a chance to vote against your freedoms? I don't understand how one couples marriage in any way interferes with another couples marriage. If it does then do I get to interfere with your marriage?\nAgreed.\n \n So you see Easy. Not everyone you would consider one of those damned 'liberals' thinks the same way or supports the same causes to the same extent at all.",
