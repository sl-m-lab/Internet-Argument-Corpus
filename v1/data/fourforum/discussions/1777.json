   "Well, I got thinking the other day after I woke up from this REALLY odd dream. I was wondering what everything means in them. Do you think there is symbolisim in your dreams or are they just something your imagination makes up for you to think about while you sleep? Do you dream things that you secretly desire? I've heard all these different things. I wanted to hear what you guys had to say and I also put the thread up for people to share any dreams they have had.\n Just a thought.\n ~ElusiveShadow",

   "So far, the only one to have actually written down what dreams meant was Frued. His theories are ones that some modern day psycholgist (and psychitrist) take with a grain of salt.\n For example, he suggested that if you dream of cows, you were not breast feed enough as a baby.\n I'd like to offer up the possibility that a dream of cows could suggest a few other ideas:\n 1) You crave beef.\n 2) You have a fear of cows (cowaphobic or something).\n 3) You ate too many cheeseburgers at dinner time.\n 4) (Especially if it was a Texas Longhorn) You are horny.\n 5) You saw some cows during the day but it was a minor thing...you thought.\n 6) You have a facination with cows.\n 7) Your dream was taking you to a farm and subconscously put cows in there as a way to say \"Hey, I'm at a farm.\"\n 8) You just watched the movie Twister before going to bed.\n \n Long story short, what ever you dream could be something significant or just something that your imagination was doing. My list was just a guess.\n So what was your dream about? Wait, it was over a year and a half ago so you probibly don't remember, but I was looking at some old ones and this one looked fun.",
