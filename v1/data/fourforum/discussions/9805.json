Here's the story:VA allows Wiccan symbols on headstones\n \n And here's the actual article if you can't access the page: \n\n VA allows Wiccan symbols on headstones \n By SCOTT BAUER, Associated Press Writer \n \n Mon Apr 23, 12:47 PM ET\n \n \n \n MADISON, Wis. - The Wiccan pentacle has been added to the list of emblems allowed in national cemeteries and on goverment-issued headstones of fallen soldiers, according to a settlement announced Monday. \n \n \n A settlement between the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Wiccans adds the five-pointed star to the list of \"emblems of belief\" allowed on VA grave markers.\n \n Eleven families nationwide are waiting for grave markers with the pentacle, said Selena Fox, a Wiccan high priestess with Circle Sanctuary in Barneveld, Wis., a plaintiff in the lawsuit.\n \n The settlement calls for the pentacle, whose five points represent earth, air, fire, water and spirit, to be placed on grave markers within 14 days for those who have pending requests with the VA.\n \n \"I am glad this has ended in success in time to get markers for Memorial Day,\" Fox said.\n \n The VA sought the settlement in the interest of the families involved and to save taxpayers the expense of further litigation, VA spokesman Matt Burns said. The agency also agreed to pay $225,000 in attorneys' fees and costs.\n \n The pentacle has been added to 38 symbols the VA already permits on gravestones. They include commonly recognized symbols for Christianity, Buddhism, Islam and Judaism, as well as those for smaller religions such as Sufism Reoriented, Eckiankar and the Japanese faith Seicho-No-Ie.\n \n \"This settlement has forced the Bush Administration into acknowledging that there are no second class religions in America, including among our nation's veterans,\" said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which represented the Wiccans in the lawsuit.\n \n The American Civil Liberties Union said the agreement also settles a similar lawsuit it filed last year against the VA. In that case, the ACLU represented two other Wiccan churches and three individuals.\n \n VA-issued headstones, markers and plaques can be used in any cemetery, whether it is a national one such as Arlington or a private burial ground like that on Circle Sanctuary's property.\n \n Wicca is a nature-based religion based on respect for the earth, nature and the cycle of the seasons. Variations of the pentacle not accepted by Wiccans have been used in horror movies as a sign of the devil.\n \n ___\n \n On the Net: VA approved religious emblems: http://www.cem.va.gov/cem/hm/hmemb.asp\n \n Circle Sanctuary: http://www.circlesanctuary.org/\n \n \n\n \n I think this is absolutely wonderful that these families can get their religious symbols put on their loved ones headstones, and not have it be denied because they happen to be a part of the Wiccan religion (while other religions got to use their symbols - even small ones that are rarely heard of). I loved the part where it said it forced the Bush administration to acknowledge that there are no second class religions in the Us, not even among military veterans.\n \n \n I wish all of these deceased veterans peace in the Summerland.",

If you could supply facts instead of vague allusions that would be a big plus.\n \n Why Kronus, I am surprised at ye. Ye have argued with Jyoshu on numerous occasions and I have not perceived a lack of fluency in, or ability to deploy the rant. Oh how I have been looking forward to this!\n \n I have nothing in for the ACLU. I will state publicly that the ACLU is the single greatest insurer of Religious Rights in America. I acknowledge the ACLU's efforts to ensure the right of Christians to preach on the Las Vegas Strip and in prisons among other locales. In fact, I believe the ACLU is the bulwark of religious freedom. I simply cannot say enough good things about this organization or its efforts. \n \n So there. Happy family???\n \n I am not attacking the ACLU as an organization. I just want them to be consistent. Let us read the following text from the ACLU website:\n \n A Christian cross that is fully visible from a public sidewalk is constitutionally protected when placed in front of a church. But if that same cross were moved across the street and placed in front of city hall, it would violate the Constitution. The issue is not \"religion in the public square\" - as the rhetoric misleadingly suggests - but whether the government should be making decisions about whose sacred texts and symbols should be placed on government property and whose should be rejected.\n \n Well, there it is. Seems fair enough. The cross cannot be in the public, er, gubment property. And yet the tree, held sacred by Druids (and celebrated in Sylvan Wicca) may exist in profusion on gubment property. The hell?\n \n I am a true proponent of religious freedom. I believe that the tree and the cross should have equal representation. Anywhere there is a tree, there should be a cross. If ye truly believe that Wicca, Earth Worship, Druidism, what-not should be treated as equal to other world religion than those belief's symbols must be subject to the same standard the ACLU sets for the Christian Cross. \n \n So far the litmus test for symbol removal has been one wing-nut taking offense. I would be happy to act as wing-nut for the ACLU's suit to remove trees from public property. \n \n Earlier, I had paraphrased a line from the Wiccae Rede which I believe the ACLU should follow: \"if it harm none, do what ye will.\" Curiously, this line is completely consistent with libertarian thinking. I see no harm in a cross, neither do I see harm in a tree. \n \n Do what ye will.",

The hell?\n\n \n Ok, that's pretty simple. It isn't that the government can't use something that someone somewhere thinks is sacred. What they can't do is use something because it is sacred. I know that sounded odd, let me expand. What is at issue here is endorsement of religion, right? If the mayor sticks a big old cross up in front of town hall, it can't really be for any other reason then to say \"Yay Christianity\". And even if, by some stretch, that wasn't the reason, most people would still assume it was. The cross is the most well known Christian symbol, and it has no other well known meaning, so displaying it is de facto an endorsement of Christianity. The same would go for most well known religious symbols, like the Menorah. Trees on the other hand are most widely know for being trees. When one sees a tree one doesn't assume that there's another message there, there's no reason to think that anyone is promoting anything religious. It's just a tree. Sure, Druids may think something special about trees, they may hold them sacred. But that doesn't make all trees everywhere an automatic endorsement of Druidism. Now if a Druidic mayor planted a tree in front of town hall and held a religious ceremony dedicating it and set up a altar then the ACLU would most likely step in, at that point we would have crossed the line into endorsement of religion.\n \n \n\n So far the litmus test for symbol removal has been one wing-nut taking offense. I would be happy to act as wing-nut for the ACLU's suit to remove trees from public property. \n \n\n Not quite. The litmus test is endorsement of religion. The \"wing-nut\" is just what got the ball rolling. There are plenty of actual wing-nuts out there who get ignored because they're actually nuts; the mere presence of an offended person is not what is required to get a symbol removed.",
