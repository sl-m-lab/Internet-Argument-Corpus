   "  California may have to cut prison population by 40 percent \n Federal judges tentatively ruled on Monday that California must reduce the number of inmates in its overcrowded prison system by up to 40 percent to stop a constitutional violation of prisoners' rights.\n \n Implementing the court's ruling would result in up to 58,000 prisoners being released, Cate said, describing it as a threat to public safety.\n\n So how can THIS end up good? How do we fix this? \n \n What? More gun control? emoticon_smile",
