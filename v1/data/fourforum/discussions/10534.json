   "I've always been a fan of Chriss Angel. For those who aren't familiar with him or with his tv show, Mindfreak, Angel is an illusionist who performs acts that will blow your mind, such as walking on water, getting impaled on a wrought-iron fence, levitating from building to building, lighting up and floating light bulbs, or making a girl disappear. He work is entertaining, and he's established himself as a master of illusion and misdirection.\n \n Which brings us to modern day Republicans, the political mindfreaks of our time.\n \n On the merits, the GOP knows full well that it has lost its audience. Poll after poll shows that when it comes to issues, Americans overwhelmingly support the Democratic agenda. Political survival then depends on misdirection from this fact. At any cost.\n \n The most common form of misdirection employed by the idea-barren Republican Party is to avoid talking about ideas altogether. And the most common method used to accomplish this goal? Deflecting attention from the policy to the personal.\n \n And oh, what masters of deflection Republicans have become. A debate about whether to invade Iraq becomes a debate about whether Joe Wilson's undercover CIA wife hooked him up with a sweet junket overseas. A debate on stem cell research becomes a debate about whether Michael J. Fox exaggerates his symptoms. A debate about the right to privacy becomes a debate about whether Terri's blinks were voluntary. A debate on Iraq policy becomes a debate about how mean people are to General Petraeus. A debate about health care becomes a full-blown investigation into the lifestyles of 12 year old Graeme Frost and 2 year old Bethany Wilkerson. A debate about curbing global climate change becomes a debate about how many compact fluorescent light bulbs Al Gore has in his house. A debate about the shameful level of poverty in this country becomes a debate about how much money John Edwards spent on a haircut. A debate about who's qualified to be president becomes a debate about who does or does not wear a lapel pin. A debate about executive accountability becomes a debate about whether Representative Stark hurt Mr. Bush's feelings.\n \n Knowing that they cannot emerge victoriously out of a battle of ideas, Republicans latch on to individuals instead. Public figures and private citizens alike are fair game as the right-wing noise machine turns its cacophony-creating media apparatus in non-discriminating fashion upon any individual, any prey that can serve to distract even for one minute from the utter vapidity of the Republican platform today.\n \n It's a tried and true method of deception, for this version of political smoke and mirrors benefits from an already distracted and busy electorate. And it is so much easier to attack individuals rather than ideas. It is so much easier to appear grand when you're standing on the head of a pin rather than standing against the dwarfing backdrop of a real policy debate. \n \n And so, this army of magicians trained in misrepresentation launches into action. At the first sight that the truth may actually seep into American living rooms, they propel themselves into action. Drudge, Malkin & Co., the RNC, elected Republicans and the Faux News apparatus lower their heads and begin their work. They send out press releases, which, in typical GOP style, use every formatting option available. Caps, bold, underline, italics. It's all there as if they don't know which lie to emphasize the most. Online, the members of Republican hate sites slither into action, latching on to the target of the day and obliterating any sense of privacy and decency in the debate. Meanwhile, conservative commentators and pundits take to the air and demand with red-faced indignation that liberals apologize for whatever faux outrage they've decided to shove down American throats this time around.\n \n Piece by piece, they toss out any hollowed out fact, any twisted piece of data, any dry opinion, piling the ######## higher and higher and lighting it on fire.\n \n And thus a conservative firestorm is born.\n \n The pillar of flaming lies consumes the media landscape. Over here, in the blazing light of burning controversy, in a simulated world where shadows dance and distract and where the smoke clouds judgment and reason, there are no ideas. The individual sacrificed at the feet of Republican survival writhes in pain as Limbaugh and Coulter and the rest of the representatives of this modern Republican Party smirk and laugh and delight in the disastrous distraction of it all.\n \n And over there, in the distance, in the darkness, is the reality. Ignored by those who are transfixed on the conservative conflagration before them.\n \n The inevitable Democratic response? As we have witnessed time and time again, instead of starving the fire, they fan the flames with \"rebukes\" and resolutions of \"condemnation\" and \"apologies.\" Instead of starving a story of oxygen, they breathe out sputtering explanations and clarifications and fact sheets, which are, at this point in the game, futile.\n http://www.dailykos.com/",

   "The author has some points, but at the same time...\n There is a casual disregard for the times when the Democrats instigate such debates.\n \"General Petraeus\" is listed as an example above, which I find funny in a dark irony sort of way.\n \"Moveon.org\" MADE THAT the focus of discussion with their ad.\n And now to complain about the fact that Republicans talked about it? \n \n Nevertheless, I do see these tactics time and time again.\n It's a tactic used, abused, and re-used on the gay threads.\n \n A discussion starts on some issue, but suddenly that discussion is lost in faux outrage over words like \"homophobe\" or \"bigot\". Sometimes when nobody actually used those words.\n (Quite frankly, I have personally tried to avoid the use of such labels unless I felt that they were 99% defensible, just because I have seen too many arguments get completely sidelined by the complaints over the labels instead of a debate over the actual discrimination.)",

   "On the merits, the GOP knows full well that it has lost its audience. Poll after poll shows that when it comes to issues, Americans overwhelmingly support the Democratic agenda. Political survival then depends on misdirection from this fact. At any cost.\n\n \n This article commits a common mistake that I see Democrats make from time to time--over-reliance on polls. IMO, polls don't always accurately reflect how things will turn out because they assume themselves (as polls) to be an accurate representation of the way people vote. Many times, they are not. The 2004 election was a good example; if we were to go by the poll numbers such as approval ratings, there is no reason to assume Bush would have been elected president. I believe this is a lesson the DNC still has yet to learn: that poll #s just don't mean nearly as much as we might think they do. I believe the GOP does understand this, and as a result has won at times despite the polls. Popularity doesn't necessarily have anything to do with \"the issues\".\n \n IOW, polls may SAY that people support the DNC agenda, but when it comes crunch time where it really matters, they may not, in actuality. They may instead opt for national security and safety, or moral values (as in 2004). Or the leadership qualities of the candidate. IMO, \"the issues\" shouldn't be the only thing considered for someone running for office. \n \n I think I should also point out that, if we should do what the article does and assume polls are accurately indicative of having peoples' support or not, then Democrats should consider themselves in VERY hot water given that the approval ratings for the Democratically-controlled congress is lower than the president's, and the lowest of any Congress in history, I believe.\n \n \nA discussion starts on some issue, but suddenly that discussion is lost in faux outrage over words like \"homophobe\" or \"bigot\".\n\n \n Speaking for myself, it's not \"faux\" outrage at all, and I suspect that's the case with many instances of 'outrage'. It's genuine outrage because the words are over-used as an attack term. When someone throws in a terms like that, it is basically a veiled accusation, and they can't expect the conversation not to turn as a result. The best solution is to not resort to using subjective terms that people know will incite others.\n \n \n(Quite frankly, I have personally tried to avoid the use of such labels unless I felt that they were 99% defensible, just because I have seen too many arguments get completely sidelined by the complaints over the labels instead of a debate over the actual discrimination.)\n\n \n Yes, you have. IMO, that's commendable, even if your motivation is nothing more than to avoid sidetracking the discussion.",

The 2004 election was a good example; if we were to go by the poll numbers such as approval ratings, there is no reason to assume Bush would have been elected president.\n\n It's boring how you pull the same bait-and-switch time and time again.\n The \"approval ratings\" are an ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ANIMAL from the polls which ask \"who would you vote for\".\n At the start of the election, Kerry had an impressive lead.\n In fact, somebody said at the start that the election was Kerry's to lose.\n Which he promptly proceeded to do.\n \n Over time, Kerry shaved off his lead, and at the end most polls had Bush as the winner.\n Quite frankly, my vote was decided on voting for the opponent of the guy who I really, really didn't want to see be president, as opposed to the guy who I just really didn't want to be president.\n \n Of course your statement admits none of that.\n \n Maybe one thing you need to realize is that polls change over time.... emoticon_emb \n \n \n \nI believe this is a lesson the DNC still has yet to learn: that poll #s just don't mean nearly as much as we might think they do. I believe the GOP does understand this, and as a result has won at times despite the polls. Popularity doesn't necessarily have anything to do with \"the issues\".\n\n Can you give an actual example of when the GOP has won \"despite the polls\"?\n Cause the example you just tried to give was inaccurate.\n \n It's amusing how you're trying to turn \"ignoring the will of the people\" into a positive trait for the Republican party.\n \n \n \nIOW, polls may SAY that people support the DNC agenda, but when it comes crunch time where it really matters, they may not, in actuality.\n\n Yeah.\n And the 2006 election proves that in spades, huh... emoticon_ic \n \n Again, what example do you actually have on this issue?\n Your last attempt bombed badly.\n \n \n \nI think I should also point out that, if we should do what the article does and assume polls are accurately indicative of having peoples' support or not, then Democrats should consider themselves in VERY hot water given that the approval ratings for the Democratically-controlled congress is lower than the president's, and the lowest of any Congress in history, I believe.\n\n Yes. They should be worried.\n \n However, I suspect a large part of the difference is that the democrat congress does not have the unthinking \"ditto-head\" support that the president has.\n The Democrats were elected to take action. And when they don't show a spine to take that action, of course people are going to be upset with them.\n \n The REASON for the dissatisfaction should not be ignored while just acknowledging the EXISTENCE of the dissatisfaction. But of course it's a mistake which you are more than willing to perpetrate.\n \n \n \nSpeaking for myself, it's not \"faux\" outrage at all, and I suspect that's the case with many instances of 'outrage'. It's genuine outrage because the words are over-used as an attack term.\n\n < yawn <\n \"Over-used\"? or \"Over-accurate\"?\n And considering how many times I have seen the complaint when the term was not even used in the first place, it is very much \"faux\".\n The fact that you genuinely have such an emotion doesn't make the basis of it any less fake.\n \n \n \nThe best solution is to not resort to using subjective terms that people know will incite others.\n\n I find it hilarious how a conversation about ACTUAL DISCRIMINATION can quickly be turned into a byatch-fest about not liking the words being used.\n Sticks and stones type of thing, whereby the ACTUAL DISCRIMINATION is a bigger problem than the complaints on name-calling, but the time is consumed over complaints over the names.\n \n \n \nYes, you have. IMO, that's commendable, even if your motivation is nothing more than to avoid sidetracking the discussion.\n\n Same ol' b.s. coming from Jyoshu.\n So if I use a term in a post talking about many other things, and you try to change the topic to talk SOLELY about that term, that's my fault. emoticon_frazzled \n \n The focus of my post isn't even the term itself, but when you MAKE that the focus of your response, that's somehow my fault??? emoticon_ic \n \n Sometimes I feel like beating a dead horse and exposing such insane thinking where YOUR actions are somehow my fault.\n Where people fighting AGAINST discrimination \"causes\" the dispute, whereby the precursor of actually LEGALIZING the discrimination is ignored as the actual cause.",
