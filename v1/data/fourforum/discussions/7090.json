I don't remember if that was buried somewhere in my poli sci coursework or if maybe it was in a history class, or maybe both. The biggies (the power you absolutly DID NOT want the government to have) were secret arrest, secret trials, the power to silence the voice of dissent (say, by establishing approved protest areas in the middle of nowhere), and unlimited surveilance.\n \n Those were pretty much the biggies, especially the first, since a government with the power to secretly arrest and imprison people without a trial is essentially all powerful anyway.

He has been in business here in town for 30+ years and to the best of my knowledge has never offed anybody.\nThough the scenario is unlikely, you should recall instances from the past where seemingly quite, harmless people have been exposed as spies.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the intelligence operation.\n \nThere&#8217;s quite a difference, also, in the responses of McCain and Feingold.\n \n McCain shows proper restraint&#8230;Feingold shows exaggeration of fact.\n \n Some of you seem to be trying to paint a picture of thousands of black vans easing through neighborhoods trying to detect terrorists dialog with electronic devices, or scanning the airways for signs of terrorism on the gigajillions of phone calls we make daily. There&#8217;s no reason to assume the snooping is random. Firstly, there aren&#8217;t enough agents to do anything close to that. Secondly, and most importantly, for the 36 times Bush has re-upped the permission, he&#8217;s been shown that there is grave threat to the US from suspected terrorist activity.\n \n Your collective claim of our rolling over and giving up civil liberties is unwarranted.\n \n \n &#8220;The president has authorized NSA to fully use its resources &#8212; let me underscore this now &#8212; consistent with U.S. law and the Constitution to defend the United States and its citizens,&#8221; the official said, adding that congressional leaders have also been briefed more than a dozen times.\n \n\n \n The President is doing his job.

She says nothign of the legality of the current system, where they spy on US citizens with no warrant. I am guessing it is pretty illegal since they are talking senate investigations and pressing charges against people/\nThe senate is prone to investigate just about every single thing that comes along these days, and there's already the purported shadow of impropriety and lawlessness. You are assuming guilt before hearing proof. All your opinions here are based on opinions of others, not the assembled \"whole truth\".\n \n \n \n \n\n Becuase you saw fit to jump into the middle of the thread without even bothering to read the article that is the topic of the thread.\nYou had no evidence that I hadn't read it.

   "I've stayed out of the fray on this thread, but having taken the time to readit, I'm inclined to surmise that both sides are relying on hyperbole and missing the basic facts.\n The Patriot Act is a piece of :xcensored , IMO, but the \"Big Brother\" spying on law-abiding John Q. Public hyperbole isn't any better. It's a hyped up charge that the media loves to use to reinforce their hatred of Bush and Cheney. Their motives for making false claims and exaggerations are well-known.....and not credible, IMO. If the media was really concerned with personal freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution, where was the outrage that Clinton had hundreds of FBI files on his adversaries illegally? Where's the outrage against gun control laws that clearly violate the 2nd Amendment? Why? Because Clinton was their boy and liberalism likes gun control. When we start ascribing altruistic intents to the US media, we're all doomed to Hell (my hyperbole).\n \n The simple fact is that the American public demanded that the Federal gov't do something after 9-11. The President and Congress scrambled to create \"something\" that would be perceived as a positive step towards preventing another 9-11. In the meantime, the Constitution was temporarily shelved in favor of perceived improvements in national security. In other words, the public got what it wanted, the Patriot Act and HSA.\n Now, 4 years later, the immediate threat long over, people have begun to take a deep breath and assess the value of those initial actions taken and found them wanting. I hope that the Patriot Act goes the way of the dinosaur and would also like to see the HSA dissolved along with most of the other cabinet level agencies. To me, having an agency that monitors foreign travelers coming into the US via airports at huge costs but leaves our southern border damn near unprotected is ridiculous. Every year, hundreds of thousands of illegals gush into the US via Mexico and the HSA is too busy plugging tiny cracks in airport security. I guess that we're supposed to believe that terrorists only use airports and don't walk across unprotected borders that are much easier to pass through.emoticon_xdonno \n So, bottom line, I'd say that the chicken littles on both sides of the argument are arguing unrealistic scenarios to bolster their respective positions.\n I'm not going to alter my life one iota to proect myself from a suitcase nuke, nor am I going to become paranoid that \"Big Brother\" gives a rat's XXX about my personal phone calls and e-mails...or even posts to forums like this one. \n I will behave the same as I did pre-9-11 because I'm not prone to paranoia.",

At that point, when the court has foun them guilty, the court will decide what level of civil rights they should have. What we have right now is the executive branch deciding who is a terrorist and who is not, then essentially passing judgement and punishment on that person. It is little more than a kangaroo court.

   "...and there are no civil rights for foreign terrorists guaranteed by our Constitution...a fact seemingly overlooked by those screaming, \"Foul!\" It also argues for the legality of the taps.\n \n You call a foreign terrorist on the phone or carry on email traffic with one...your conversation should be tapped. I suspect the NSA has a list of known and suspected foreign terrorists and is using that list wisely. We have no need to see their list.\n \n Kill emoticon_xkill all terrorists and those who support them!\n\n \n \n There are civil rights for EVERYBODY in the US in our constitution, and the supreme court recently ruled (much to the chagrin of the Bush administration) that those protections apply to people in US custody as well. \n \n A warrant is required to listen in on the phone calls of anybody in the US. That is why the taps are illegal. Prior to Bushs order, it was perfectly legal for the NSA to listen in on phone calls in other countries. If the person called within the united states, they could not listen. They COULD leave the tape machine running while they requested a warrant, something that took less than 5 minutes. They have a special court, with their opwn assinged judge, and a backup judge. It was simply a matter of filling out a short form, calling the judge, and sending a fax. \n \n My local police deparment can have a warrant any time night or day in less than 5 minutes. They call the dispatch center and have the dispatcher fill out the form and fax it to the judge on duty. Then they call the judge on duty, wherever they are, in case the judge has any questions. The Judge signs the warrant, informs the officer that it is signed, and the officer cna proceed with the search. The judge faxes the signed warrant back to the dispatcher and somebody runs it out to the search site. Our local PD does NOT have their own specially assinged court. I see no reason that teh NSA can not follow normal procedure, make the call, and get the warrant.",

   "I've stayed out of the fray on this thread, but having taken the time to readit, I'm inclined to surmise that both sides are relying on hyperbole and missing the basic facts.\n The Patriot Act is a piece of :xcensored , IMO, but the \"Big Brother\" spying on law-abiding John Q. Public hyperbole isn't any better. It's a hyped up charge that the media loves to use to reinforce their hatred of Bush and Cheney. Their motives for making false claims and exaggerations are well-known.....and not credible, IMO. If the media was really concerned with personal freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution, where was the outrage that Clinton had hundreds of FBI files on his adversaries illegally? Where's the outrage against gun control laws that clearly violate the 2nd Amendment? Why? Because Clinton was their boy and liberalism likes gun control. When we start ascribing altruistic intents to the US media, we're all doomed to Hell (my hyperbole).\n\n \n I actually agree with you on this one to an extent, JP. I do not think that the current situation is that terrible. At the same time, I know absolutly that every government will abuse the power they are given. I know this becuse history has shown it so clearly so many times. You give a good example right here. Gun control. When the NFA was passed (1938...the law that restricts machine guns, short barrel shotguns, etc...) it was widely held that it was wholly unconstitutional and would be tossed out the minute it hit the supreme court. It was not widely enforced becuase its primary purpose was to fight organized crime at the time. My grandfater had a .410 pistol and a coupel fo silencers when it was passed and he never registered any of them. It was widley known in his community and nobody really cared, including law enforcement. After all, as soon as the law hit the supreme court, it was going to be thrown out. \n \n Instead, it never really made it to the supreme court. For years prosecutors dropped charges rather than allow cases to go forward on appeal. Slowly the public just kind of got used to the idea. 9 out of 10 constitutional scholars will still tell you that it is blatently unconstitutional, but even today it has never really made it to the supreme court as a full second ammendment challenge.\n \n The last run of gun control was about flash hiders and high cap mags. The public has gotten so used to gun control that they accepted it serenely.\n \n Do you really want to see the same thing done with your right to be secure against warrantless wire taps or habeus corpus, or your right to a trial? I don't. The time to fight such things is at their inception, not 40 years later when it has reached the point that they are the norm. It was Patrick Henry who said:\n \n \"Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined.\" \n \n He was correct. Somewhere a line has to be drawn, and that line has to be defended. That line in the us has always kind of been the bill of rights. That is the line that we drew against our government over 200 years ago. Unless we are willing to defend that line, it is meaningless. We may as well trash the whole thing.",

If there is some kind of legitimate proof on hand that they are terrorists, gettign that warrant should not be a problem. \n \n What we know and what we can prove are two different things, and frankly what we know does not count for squat. All that matters under our system is what we can prove. You either believe in the concpet of rights or you do not, and if you do not, then you cannot claim them for yourself. A right is not somethign granted by the governemtn on a situational basis. A right cannot be give, all men have them by virtue of the fact that they were born.

I prefer not to.\n \n \nYou have proven nothing here, daewoo...just presented more deceptive arguments designed, I suspect, to save face.\n\n \n I have refuted every point you have made here, Jim. You came in here swignign without even bothering to catch up on the thread, likely because I made you look likie an utter fool in other threads here lately, and the danger in making you look the fool is that you almost always go hunting the person who did so. Now you are just digging yourself a deeper hole. \n \n The facts here are simple. The NSA is carrying out survelance on people in the US without warrants. That is illegal and improper. That is pretty much all there is to it. You can try to legitimize it all you want, but the facts are unchanged. The NSA is runnign wiretaps on people in the US without having a warrant. Tjhat is crystal clear.\n \n As far as your unwillingness to give up your rights, frankly I would be more inclined to remove your rights than those of a terrorist becuase frankly I think you are more dangerous. We have established here the terrorists motivation. They want us out of the ME. They do not want us supporting tyrants and dictators. I can live with that. You, on the other hand, seek to undermine the very basis of the american way of life.

You came in here swignign without even bothering to catch up on the thread, likely because I made you look likie an utter fool in other threads here lately, and the danger in making you look the fool is that you almost always go hunting the person who did so. Now you are just digging yourself a deeper hole. \n \n The facts here are simple. The NSA is carrying out survelance on people in the US without warrants. That is illegal and improper. That is pretty much all there is to it. You can try to legitimize it all you want, but the facts are unchanged. The NSA is runnign wiretaps on people in the US without having a warrant. Tjhat is crystal clear.\n \n As far as your unwillingness to give up your rights, frankly I would be more inclined to remove your rights than those of a terrorist becuase frankly I think you are more dangerous. We have established here the terrorists motivation. They want us out of the ME. They do not want us supporting tyrants and dictators. I can live with that. You, on the other hand, seek to undermine the very basis of the american way of life. In your rush to trade liberty for security, you are willing to destroy everything that makes the US worth fighting for.\nI see you belong to that small group that believes if they keep wriggling and come up with the last post, they win. You have changed your arguments to the point to that you have sublimated into ridiculousness. I put text in red letters that clearly indicate you're full of bull concerning the goals of al Qaeda and you simply ignore them and go into some rant about removing the remaining tyrants in the ME. Bin Laden called for Muslims ALL OVER THE WORLD to wage a holy war against the US, American citizens and Jews...and you still can't get the picture.\n \n \nRegardless of where they are striking, their goal is unchanged...to drive the US out of the ME.\nIn this case I trust the words from the horse's mouth rather than you. They are explained in red letters in my previous post. They come from a link that you evidently chose to ignore.\n \n \nThey plan to bring down the houe of Saud. the government of Kuwait, and the baathists in Syria. You strike your enemy where you can. In the Sudan we were supporting some pretty unsavory folks...folks that made Saddam look like a choir boy. \n\n \n Well lookie here. You support a group that wants to do the same things he relentlessly criticizes the US for doing. After all we just wanted to remove the tyrants from Afgahanistan and the baathists in Iraq.\n \n \nI will ALWAYS support the toppling of a totalitarian government, and will ALWAYS be ashamed of my government when they go out of their way to support a totalitarian governent as they have done in so many places in the ME. \nHere you lie again. You have not supported the US in the toppling of Saddam.\n \n I think you are ashamed of your government because you live where it is permissable to criticize the government and you think you're being fashionable in doing so.\n \n \n You, my friend, are a sick man and have severely limited your credibility.

Muslims who do not heed this call are declared apostates (people who have forsaken their faith).\n\n \n What portion of that refutes my claims as far as what BL wants from the US?\n \n Apparently you have ignored your own link, as strange as that sounds. What does Bin laden want?\n \n \nThe principal stated aims of al-Qaeda are to drive Americans and American influence out of all Muslim nations, especially Saudi Arabia; destroy Israel; and topple pro-Western dictatorships around the Middle East. Bin Laden has also said that he wishes to unite all Muslims and establish, by force if necessary, an Islamic nation adhering to the rule of the first Caliphs. \n\n \n Are you daft man? What part of this are you not understanding? Where is the \"convert to islam or die\"? You need to work on your reading comprehension skills.\n \n \nWell lookie here. You support a group that wants to do the same things he relentlessly criticizes the US for doing. After all we just wanted to remove the tyrants from Afgahanistan and the baathists in Iraq.\n\n \n Those are not our tyrants to remove, and we replaced Saddams government with a worse one. You can spin it however you want, but the Dawa party is the primary party in Iraw. Who they work for is well documented, and Saddam, with all his faults, was without a doubt the most humanitarian leader in the ME. Now he is gone, and those Iraqis are to be att he mercy of the Iranians. I have never opposed the removal of Saddam in principal. I have oppose the manner in which he was removed. I have opposed the rediculous cision for the future of Iraq that the Bushies held (mainly becuase it was so totaly unrealistic as to be laughable). \n \n Those are my objections to the war. It was simply a situation where nothing good could possibly come of it. Saddam was NOT a totalitarian.

Whent hey tried to overthrow the government, things got nasty. The Shia were primrily left alone under the same terms. Now that the US had had our hand at running the country and been forced to resort to tactics as bad or worse than saddam (we CERTAINLY have more political prisoners tha he ever did), I would think you would have a more realistic view of his leadership. \n \n \nI think you are ashamed of your government because you live where it is permissable to criticize the government and you think you're being fashionable in doing so.\n\n \n No, I am ashamed of my governement because they support folks like the Sauds, Pinochet, Saddam, the list goes on and on.

   "I actually agree with you on this one to an extent, JP. I do not think that the current situation is that terrible. At the same time, I know absolutly that every government will abuse the power they are given. I know this becuse history has shown it so clearly so many times. You give a good example right here. Gun control. When the NFA was passed (1938...the law that restricts machine guns, short barrel shotguns, etc...) it was widely held that it was wholly unconstitutional and would be tossed out the minute it hit the supreme court. It was not widely enforced becuase its primary purpose was to fight organized crime at the time. My grandfater had a .410 pistol and a coupel fo silencers when it was passed and he never registered any of them. It was widley known in his community and nobody really cared, including law enforcement. After all, as soon as the law hit the supreme court, it was going to be thrown out. \n \n Instead, it never really made it to the supreme court. For years prosecutors dropped charges rather than allow cases to go forward on appeal. Slowly the public just kind of got used to the idea. 9 out of 10 constitutional scholars will still tell you that it is blatently unconstitutional, but even today it has never really made it to the supreme court as a full second ammendment challenge.\n \n The last run of gun control was about flash hiders and high cap mags. The public has gotten so used to gun control that they accepted it serenely.\n \n Do you really want to see the same thing done with your right to be secure against warrantless wire taps or habeus corpus, or your right to a trial? I don't. The time to fight such things is at their inception, not 40 years later when it has reached the point that they are the norm. It was Patrick Henry who said:\n \n \"Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined.\" \n \n He was correct. Somewhere a line has to be drawn, and that line has to be defended. That line in the us has always kind of been the bill of rights. That is the line that we drew against our government over 200 years ago. Unless we are willing to defend that line, it is meaningless. We may as well trash the whole thing.\n\n \n For years I listened to a local talk show host, Mark Scott, who started off every show with his granddaughter saying \" I love my country, but I fear my government.\" That about sums up my beliefs as well. I prefer to not give them any additional power, even \"temporarily\". I don't trust the Federal gov't, especially now that \"compassionate conservatives\" have morphed into a new flavor of super-liberalism. :xcensored :xcensored",

   "I think that we would all be nieve not to acknowlege, or at least suspect, that, legal or not, intelligence gathering agencies, both local and large, have been eavesdropping, bugging and spying on people of interest to them for decades. FBI. CIA. Local cops. Nosey wannabes.\n \n They may not be able to present the evidence gathered on an illegal wiretap in a courtroom but it might help them quickly get to the heart of the matter in order to decide whether a proper investigation might be in order. When administered properly. \n \n Anyone one of us in this forum could visit our local radio shack and purchase a scanner over the counter that will pick up telephone conversations of anyone who might be transmitting on that frequency. And in doing so, if you heard some foreign accent discussing chaos and terror, would you not report it? Do you really know who is listening to you and Mary Lou, when you both say all those bad things about Aunt Betty? \n \n How would you feel about your next door neighbor tapping into your phone line and snooping? Outraged? Why? What have you got to hide? (Do you see how flimsy that weak arse excuse is?)\n \n Just the other day, I saw a bronze, black walled tire, plain Jane car parked behind the Karl's Jr., with a uniformed cop inside. It had at least a dozen antennaes coming off the trunk and roof. It gave me a rather uneasy feeling. And this is why. It's not that I have anything to hide myself. But I can think of conversations I have from time to time that I prefer to keep close to the breast and in low-breath. I really cherish that freedom. I feel somewhat violated knowing that is no longer a 100% guarantee. Adios privacy. \n \n I could conceed this issue of Bush's illegal eavesdropping might be for the better good of the whole when debated on facts except for the following issues:\n \n (I preface by saying this is merely my opinion formed on personal observations and the analysis of the same.) \n \n The current powers in control cannot be trusted. Period. They have twisted. They have lied. They represent special interest groups that stand for much I stand against. Stand up to this administration and you will be sliced, diced and julianne'd on the screen for all to see. (How many times have we ALL witnessed this?) What makes me think that they would think twice before slandering or blackmailing another citizen, with gathered info, that is totally unrelated to the War on Terror, that they may \"inadvertantly\" attained, should that person not be in their corner, a critic or political opponent? An anonymous news leak here, an ennuendo there, say it three times and it's on FoxNews.\n \n I just do not trust the current administration. Too much water under the bridge. And the flood, I suspect, has yet to begin. I think they should be prevented from making a single move in Washington until we have a chance to clean house during the next elections. Enough is enough. I am confident that enough eyes have been opened in America to effect a change in our future political landscape. It is the present landscape that worries me. How much more damage to the nation can they do in the short time they have to do it in? \n \n There might be some plausable reason for a double-secret court to operate in matters of covertness and intelligence gathering. Maybe not. Time will tell, BUT, this is not the time, with people sporting the Bush mentality in our government offices, to be taking this touchy violation of liberties for a test drive. It will be abused. Count on it.\n \n Heck, after writing opinions such as this, I fear to hit the send button these days. I know we are being monitored. These folks really do scare me.",

When I say \"The 9/11 attacks were retaliation\" I am not supporting or condoning the attack, merely accepting the fact that they were not random events. \n \n I think the problem is that Jim has a very simplistic outlook on the world and we do not live in a simple world. Very few things are black and white, especially in the current conflict\n\n \n I'd have to say that your views are at least as simplistic as Jim's.

   "Though I have only read a sampling of the posts on this thread, I would still like to add my two cents to the issue of the government evesdropping on communication between its citizens.\n \n For me, a few questions need to be addressed:\n \n 1) Is it useful in helping to address a particular problem - in this case, the terrorist threat? Possibly. Just as with evesdropping in typical criminal investigations, most information is useless, but sometimes one stumbles upon a useful gem.\n \n 2) Does it overly infringe on our civil liberties? It depends on whether it is misused. If there is indeed a strong reason to suspect a particular person of being involved in terrorism, then I would condone such eavesdropping. If it is simply someone who is a political agitator against the government, then that is an example of misuse of that power.\n \n 3) How could you prevent misuse of such powers of eavesdropping at the hands of the government? If such a thing can exist, then a non-partisan, independent entity (ex. judges with Secret clearance) could decide on a case-by-case basis whether eavesdropping is justified.\n \n 4) Can a truly independent, non-partison watchdog organization really exist and have the power to curb the government's power? I am skeptical in this climate, but could be convinced with proper arguements.",

It was Carter that started our reign of terror in S America. Reagan just escalated it.\n \n The idea of not supporting tyrants and despots is only impractical if you cannot accept the fact that the United States has no right to rule the world, and that others in the world have a right to their own freedom, even if it leads them in a direction we do not approve of. \n \n Pinochet was installed and supported becuase the people of Chile had freely elected, in monitored elections, an extremely popular socialist. This was unacceptable to the US. We fought in Vietnam becuase after convincing the people there of houw great democracy was and setting up and scheduling elections there, we called them off when it became clear that the socialists were goign to win the elections. \n \n In a lot of ways we are stillfighting the cold war, unwillign to accept the fact that the world has seen our form of government and social system and soundly rejected it. We are still trying to force it down their throats in many cases, despite the fact that from a practical social standpoint, we have already lost the cold war. Socialism has spread across the globe and nations have become more socialist as time passes, and in most cases the people in those nations are happy for the change.\n \n In other cases, we interfere and install tyrants ebcause it is easier to deal with a few totally self motivated individuals than to deal with a governemtn thats primary concern is its people. This is the case in Saudi Arabia. We prefer that a few people control the oil in Saudi Arabia and the rest of the nation is treated like trash becuase it makes them predictable and easy to deal with and in helping those tyrants stay in power we cement their support. \n \n As low as US approval ratings are in Saudi Arabis, no democratically elected government would have possibly ever allowed us to base troops there. By assisting the tyrants, we have bought them, and know that we can push ahrd enough and they will do what they are told.\n \n You are certainly correct that it is more difficult if we do nto install dictators all over the world. Many things would be easier if we had a dictator ruling the united states. The fact that it makes it more convenient for us does not in any way justify your stance here.",

   "Impotence? Maybe you could explain what you would have liked Carter to do about the Svoiet invasion of Afghanistan. This should be rich.\n\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Carter\n One of the greatest contributors to Carter's political downfall came in November of 1979 when a pro-U.S. monarchy was toppled by the 1979 Iranian Revolution and dozens of American hostages were taken inside the American embassy by Islamic fundamentalist revolutionaries after Carter gave sanctuary to exiled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. With the international outrage at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan later the same year, Carter appeared impotent, as America saw its influence declining abroad.\n \n \n President Carter initially departed from the long-held policy of containment toward the Soviet Union, as first articulated in the Truman Doctrine and held to by all subsequent American presidents, both Republican and Democrat.\n \n See, he had no balls. John Kennedy made the Soviets back down with a blockade and fearless threat of nuclear war. Carter just relaxed and said in effect, &#8220;Y&#8217;all can have Afghanistan.&#8221;\n \n The main conflict between human rights and U.S. interests came in Carter's dealings with the Shah of Iran. The Shah had been a strong ally of America since World War II, and was one of the \"twin pillars\" upon which U.S. strategic policy in the Middle East was built. However, his rule was strongly autocratic. Though Carter praised the Shah as a wise and valuable leader, when a popular uprising against the monarchy broke out in Iran, the Carter administration did not intervene.\n The Shah was deposed and exiled. Many have since connected the Shah's dwindling U.S. support as a leading cause of his quick overthrow. Carter was initially prepared to recognize the revolutionary government of the monarch's successor, but his efforts proved futile.\n \n \n In December 1979, USSR invaded Afghanistan, after the pro-Moscow Afghanistan government placed by a 1978 coup was overthrown. There are many theories as to why the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Some believed the Soviets were attempting to expand their borders southward in order to gain a foothold in the region. The Soviet Union had long lacked a warm water port, and their movement south seemed to position them for further expansion toward Pakistan and India in the East, and Iran to the West. The Carter administration, and many Republicans and Democrats alike, feared that the Soviets were positioning themselves for a takeover of Middle Eastern oil. Others believed that the Soviet Union was fearful that the Muslim uprising would spread from Iran and Afghanistan to the millions of Muslims in the USSR. After the invasion, Carter announced the Carter Doctrine: that the US would not allow any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf. Carter terminated the Russian Wheat Deal, a keystone Nixon Detente initiative to establish trade with USSR and lessen Cold War tensions. The grain exports had been beneficial to people employed in agriculture, and the Carter embargo marked the beginning of hardship for American farmers. He also prohibited Americans from participating in the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, and reinstated registration for the draft for young males. Carter and Zbigniew Brzezinski started a $40 billion covert program of training Islamic fundamentalists in Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n \n The grain embargo hurt the American farmers and in turn, the American economy. (Don&#8217;t we all remember those years of rampant inflation and high interest rates?)\n \n Refusing to take part in the Olympics simply gave the Russians more gold medals.\n \n I suppose one thing he might have done is similar to what Kennedy did against the Russians in the Cuban missile crisis. He could have thwarted their use of the seaport of Afghanistan. One of their key goals was a warm water port. He just didn&#8217;t have the balls to stand up to them in such a military fashion.\n \n Another thing he could have done would have been to REFRAIN FROM LETTING THE RUSSIANS KNOW THAT HE WOULD NOT INTERFERE IF THEY INVADED AFGHANISTAN. That, my friend was a MAJOR blunder.\n \n Though his plan to train the Islamic fundamentalists is said to have contributed to the eventual collapse of the Soviet, it left the Taliban in control of the country...and we all know what happened after that.\n \n \n \n \n \n http://www.discoverthenetwork.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=1655\n \n \n \n \n \n While Carter's administration brought the U.S. some of its worst economic conditions in living memory - with soaring interest and inflation rates - his worst failing as President was in the realm of foreign policy. His human rights policy led to human rights disasters in Nicaragua and Iran, where he facilitated the rise to power of Marxists and Islamist despots, respectively. Both of those new tyrannies far surpassed the brutality of their predecessors. The fruits of the Iran disaster are still very much with the United States today. If the U.S. would have supported the Shah or his successors, the history of the past 25 years in the Middle East would have been very different, and the Iranian people would have fared much better. Moreover, the Soviet Union would have hesitated greatly over invading Afghanistan in 1979. Carter's timid approach to international conflicts emboldened the USSR to extend its reach further into the Third World. \n \n By letting the Soviets know he would not respond if they invaded Afghanistan, Carter spawned a war that ultimately saw one million dead Afghans, five million displaced, and a situation of evil that nurtured the Islamic hatred and militancy that ultimately turned on the West and brought about 9/11.\n \n During his Presidency and the years since then, Carter has demonstrated a refusal to acknowledge the hard reality that evil must sometimes be met with overwhelming force; that negotiation cannot always win the day when one is dealing with an enemy that has no interest in mutual respect or peaceful coexistence. Even Neville Chamberlain, the arch-appeaser of England in the 1930s, eventually came to understand the dark truth about the Nazis, but Carter and similarly minded leftists cannot be shaken from their sentimental view of the world, even by something as stark as 9/11.\n \n Carter is a mixture of neo-Kantianism&#8212;that is, the philosophical view that one's good intentions outweigh the practical consequences of one's actions and words&#8212;and leftwing Christian pacifism that believes the use of force is always wrong. Although Carter, like most leftists, says that the use of force is always to be available as \"the last resort,\" in practice Carter would never reach \"the last resort.\" There is always one more negotiation to be held, one more appeal to the United Nations, one more \"last-ditch effort\" to try. Whereas Ronald Reagan believed in \"peace through strength,\" Carter believes in \"peace through talk\"; this was the hallmark of his Presidency.",

   "ABSOLUTLY INCORRECT. First of all, we played the same games under Carter. It was Carter that started our reign of terror in S America. Reagan just escalated it.\n \n The idea of not supporting tyrants and despots is only impractical if you cannot accept the fact that the United States has no right to rule the world, and that others in the world have a right to their own freedom, even if it leads them in a direction we do not approve of. \n \n Pinochet was installed and supported becuase the people of Chile had freely elected, in monitored elections, an extremely popular socialist. This was unacceptable to the US. We fought in Vietnam becuase after convincing the people there of houw great democracy was and setting up and scheduling elections there, we called them off when it became clear that the socialists were goign to win the elections. \n \n In a lot of ways we are stillfighting the cold war, unwillign to accept the fact that the world has seen our form of government and social system and soundly rejected it. We are still trying to force it down their throats in many cases, despite the fact that from a practical social standpoint, we have already lost the cold war. Socialism has spread across the globe and nations have become more socialist as time passes, and in most cases the people in those nations are happy for the change.\n \n In other cases, we interfere and install tyrants ebcause it is easier to deal with a few totally self motivated individuals than to deal with a governemtn thats primary concern is its people. This is the case in Saudi Arabia. We prefer that a few people control the oil in Saudi Arabia and the rest of the nation is treated like trash becuase it makes them predictable and easy to deal with and in helping those tyrants stay in power we cement their support. \n \n As low as US approval ratings are in Saudi Arabis, no democratically elected government would have possibly ever allowed us to base troops there. By assisting the tyrants, we have bought them, and know that we can push ahrd enough and they will do what they are told.\n \n You are certainly correct that it is more difficult if we do nto install dictators all over the world. Many things would be easier if we had a dictator ruling the united states. The fact that it makes it more convenient for us does not in any way justify your stance here.\n\n \n \n No argument that the US' policies in SA were purely anti-USSR cold war policies. We backed anybody that was anti-USSR. Was that a bad move? Difficult to say. Would a group of USSR satelites in our hemisphere be a threat to the US someday? I guess that's a topic for debate. We do know that Cuba was certainly a potential threat when the USSR began trying to place nukes there. Who knows what may have happened if SA countries had become USSR satelites. I'm not sure that installing Pinochet wasn't a good strategic move for the US regardless of the eventual consequneces to Chile. The world during the Cold War was a cold place. Bottom line, we chose to prevent the USSR from establishing a foothold in our backyard by any means necessary. At the time, that was in our best interests. The focus has changed with the demise of the USSR, so I agree that the strategy also needs to change. We're now the only 900 pound gorilla in the world and we need to stop acting like there's still another one out there. :xbanghead",

That does not mean that they have the right to seize land that is not theirs. When they seized the \"disputed territories\", the UNSC issued a resolution requiring its immediate return. Israel is currently in violation of over 30 UNSC resolutions for everything from illegally invasion and occupation to gross human rights abuses. \n \n There is a chance that in loosing the occupied territories they will not be able to remain functional as a country. Then they will fail to exist. If the only way they can exist is through constant war with their neiborghs, then NO, they have no right to exist. Hitler invaded Poland because he HAD to. Germanys economy was sunk, and only its defense industries were keeping it alive. He had to acquire more wealth in order keep the country running, and the only way to pull it off at that point was to start invading other countries and take their wealth. Did germany have a right to eist? Sure, but not at the expense of surrounding countries. \n \n \nClarify.\n\n \n What clarification is needed? No more fixing elections in other countries, no more installing dictators, no more using our military as a trade negotiation tool.\n \n \nUnrealistic. An isolationist policy cannot work in this day and age.\n\n \n Ignorant drivel. If we are not supporting dictators all over the world, you will find that we do not need our military as badly. Let regional conflicts be dealt with either regionally or with full cooperation of the UN. I am not calling for isolationism. I am saying that there is no need for us to try to be the worlds policman, nor is it right for us to use our military as a trade negotiation tool.

Your article is implying that by faling to support the shah Carter telegraphed to the Russians that we would not interfere. I think the guy who wrote your article is an idiot. There are too many blatant factual errors to take the guys opinion seriosly (you fall into the same category on this one). \n \n His argument that the Russians were emboldened by our failure to supprot the Shah is fatally flawed for several resons:\n \n 1. We DID support the Shah. In 1978, during the islamic revolution, we snet of $1 billion in new weapons and surveilance equipmetn to Iran\n \n 2. The Shah abdicated his post and fled Iran. His opposition did not even control the country at that point.\n \n 3. It was our support of the Shah, the fact that we allowed him into the US for medical treatment and then refused to deport him back to Iran, that caused the later hostage crisis.\n \n The revolution in Iran was a grass roots effort. IT was an unstoppable force that permeated every level of Iran. Unfortunatly, like you, whoever wrote that article believes in the mythical magic military wand that we just wave and all our problems go away.

He was just a wimp when it came to flexing military muscles. John Kennedy, on the other hand, was a lion.\n\n \n Oh, yea, the bay of pigs was definatly the work of a lion...using mercenaries and untrained seperatists because he was so afraid of the US being associated with it. \n \n \nI have explained my lack of thoroughness in the port mistake. I don't know your age, but I'm wondering if you were still wet behind the ears in the '70s when Carter was considered BY MANY to have done exactly as I claim. He let the Russians know we would not respond. Regardless of what you claim to be the reason for this opinion, HELD BY MANY, it was indeed true. He was a wimp.\n\n \n As I said, 20 million people believe that have been abducted by aliens. The facts do not bear out the opinion that Carter was simply a wimp. In Iran, he supported the Shah. The Shah simply wimped out and left the country. He was afraid he might loose, rocognized based on the US experience in Vietnam that US assurances did not necessarily mean we could uphold our end of the deal, and he was afraid that if he lost, he would be tried and killed. So he took $300 billion dollars and fled the country. \n \n In Afghanistan, there was no opportunity for containment. It was over before it started. There was no gain for the US in attempting to invade Afghnaistan in order to take the coutnry back, and the expense, incluidng retooling the entire US military for the job, would have been HUGE. We had no way to get our troops into the country, no way to resupply them, and no real chance of vistory since the entire Soviet militarty could be brought to bear in less than 14 days to end any kind of ill advised US intervantion.\n \n There will always be those who believe that having the best military in the world is a magic wand that can be waved to make problems go away. They are sorely mistaken. If you can not get you men and equipment into a location, and with enough troopp strenght to secure your method in ingress, you cannot possibly win. If you cannot resupply your troops efficiently, you cannot possibly win. \n \n What it comes down to is that we could not possibly have won in Afghanistan. While th US military was certainly better than the Soviet military technologically, we sould almost cetainly have lost in Afghanistan. We chose a long time ago to equip our military with relatively few \"superweapons\" instead of optign to provide weapons that could be quickly and produced and that are cheap enough that we can afford to produce them in quantitiy. This makes for a military that is highly effective in a limied engagement, or an engagment against a smaller adversary. Against the Soviets in afghansitan, even if we had managed to put the ENTIRE US military on the groud, we would have certainly lost. While US tanks had provent to be twices as effective as soviet tanks, they had 6x as many tanks as we had. Their fighters were only 80% as effective as ours, but they had 4X the number. \n \n Couple this with the fact that their resupply and reinforcements were hours away, while ours were days away. They could outproduce us on ordinance nearly 10 to 1. They had complete control of the country, including fortified military postions and already had a complete supply chain in place that they had built for the Afghanis. It was a war that we could not possibly have won. \n \n \nThat was not his argument. His argument was:\n \n Carter's timid approach to international conflicts emboldened the USSR to extend its reach further into the Third World. \n\n \n And my argument is that the guy is an idiot. He offers no evidence to back his claims, and th facts do not bear him out. This is why you need to be careful about posting opinion articles as fact...especially opinion articles from obviously biased sources. You have to be careful to check the facts, especially important in your case, where you do not seem to have any in your posession, just unfounded, unsupportable rhetoric.\n \n \nThe Shah was overthrown and exiled.\n\n \n He was exiled in the fact that he could nto return to his country. He was NOT forcibly exiled. Your argument does not make any sense here. You seem to be claiing that the Iranians kicked him out of the ocuntry, then a few years later wante him back so badly that they were willing to spit in the eye of the US and face serious sanctions to get hom back. That does not even make any sense. It is illogical. \n \n When he fled Iran, he still had comlete control of the military.\n \n \nAppeasement works better in all cases?\n\n \n What appeasement?\n \n \nThe \"go ahead\" was not imaginary.\n\n \n Yes, it was. Not only was it imaginary, it was not even imagend until 20 yrs after the fact, and was only imagined in the US. Your stance on this does not make sense AT ALL. You are arguing that our handling of Iran, when we did not get directly involved in a POPULAR overthrow somehow sent the Russians a signal that it was OK to overthrow Afghanistan. \n \n Lets step into the real world here for just a minute, Jim.

It is so full of double talk that is is worthless. For example:\n \n \nArticle (17): 1st - Each person has the right to personal privacy as long as it does not violate the rights of others or general morality.\n\n \n Privacy as long as what you are doing is considered moral...\n \n \n7th - Court sessions will be open unless the court decides to make them secret.\n\n \n Court sessions will be open...unless they are not\n \n \n9th - Laws do not apply retroactively unless otherwise has been legislated, and this exception does not include laws of taxes and duties.\n\n \n Laws do not apply retroactivley, unless they do\n \n \nArticle (23): 1st - Private property is protected and the owner has the right to use it, exploit it and benefit from it within the boundaries of the law.\n \n \n You have the right to private property...unless you don't\n \n This is one of the better tricks in the consitution:\n \n \nArticle (28): 1st - Taxes and fees shall not be imposed, amended, collected or eliminated except by law.\n 2nd - Low-income people should be exempted from taxes in a way that guarantees maintaining the minimum level necessary for a living. This shall be regulated by law.\n\n \n Everything in the Iraqi consitituion is to be regulated by law, but without guidelines as to what those law shall or shall not be. There are virtually zero limits on what kinds of laws may or may not be passed, excpet fo one, which is that no law may undermine the laws of Islam.\n \n \nThe Shiites must still find a coalition partner to be THE government.\n\n \n They already have...the Kurds, who have stated openly un explicitly that they do not care what happens in the rest of Iraq, and they will vote with the shia on every issue, as long as Kurdish autonomy is recognized.\n \n \n \nI'm not sure of anything you say here. The unfunny thing about Iraq, prior to US sanctions, was the brutal tyranny of its former leader.\n\n \n Thats becuase you do not bother to do any research or follow what is goin on in the world. You simply base your opinions on feel good political rhetoric. Like IO have said before, compared to other olaces in the ME, Saddam aws a benign leader. It appears, based on the actions of the current iraqi government (secret detainments, torturing, and executions) that Iraq will soon be as bad or worse than any other Arab nation.",

Do you really think that they needed any kind of evidence that we were powerless to stop them invading Afghanistan, a nation right in their back yard? Beyond that...A LANDLOCKED naitonin their own back yard, which means no beachhead for the offloading of supplies. We would have had to AIRLIFT every bit of equipment and every man into a conflict in Afghanistan, which means significant expense in logistics. We would have had to try to maintain runways with bombs constantly taking them out. The only way for us to take afghnaistan back fromt eh soviets would have been the same way they took it to begin with...come across the soviet border. That would have meant invading the Soviet Union first. Not practical.Do you really think that an opinion piece from \"the guide to the politcal left\" is a trustowrthy source?\nLet&#8217;s see&#8230;we had a naval and air power that could have attacked Soviet positions anywhere in the world without setting foot on dry land. Deploying them in the Persian Gulf may have had some effect of the Soviets well known intent to invade Afghanistan. As John Kennedy proved, sometimes rattling the sword causes retreat of the enemy. Carter let it be known that he wouldn&#8217;t even pick it up.\nQuote: Carter was a wimpy, impotent (in foreign affairs) President. No matter how you dismiss sources I post, that opinion is held by more people than you care to admit. \n Over 20 million people worldwide believe that they have been abducted by aliens. That doesn't make it so. My experience has been that most folks who hold views similar to yours are just as ignorant as you are to the facts. They spout the same tired BS, such as \"we abandoned ths Shah\" when, in fact, we NEVER abandoned the Shah, and the fact that we never abandoned the Shah is what led to the Iran hostage crisis. If sombody who actually seesm conversant witht he facts wanted to debate the point, t might be worth debating. Since to debate it with you I would first have to educate you as to what happened, it hardly seems worth my time.\nIf I depended on you for an education, I WOULD get a lobotomy.The FACT that a leader is weak-kneed can only be established by collective opinions.http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewPrint.asp?Page=\\Commentary\\archive\\200212\\COM20021216d.htmlWhy Honor Jimmy Carter?By Alan CarubaCNSNews.com Commentary from the National Anxiety CenterDecember 16, 2002Let's just say it and get it over with. The most recent winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Jimmy Carter, is dumber than a box of rocks.He is the quintessential liberal without the slightest grasp of reality. \"But, Alan, he was the President of the United States,\" you say. That's right. And the good citizens of this nation voted him out after just one term because they quickly came to the conclusion he didn't have a clue about either domestic or foreign affairs. The various despots of the world took a look at Jimmy and instantly knew they had nothing to fear. In 1979, his failure to support to the shah of Iran led to the rise of the Islamic jihad that threatens the world today. The shah was overthrown by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini whose gang of Muslim bullyboys took US diplomats hostage and held them for 444 days. It wasn't until President Ronald Reagan took the oath of office that they were freed. To this day, I am convinced he let the Iranians mullahs know he would blow Tehran off the face of the map if they didn't turn our diplomats loose. Later he would bomb Muamar Quadaffi of Libya who has been conspicuously careful ever since.In his book, In the Shadow of the Ayatollah , William J. Daugherty, a former Marine who joined the CIA and was among those held hostage by the Iranians, noted that \"Iran under the shah commenced an extensive modernization program while adopting a staunchly pro-West, anticommunist political posture.\" When Carter withdrew his support, the shah was forced to flee and the fires of Islamic fanaticism were lighted, leading ultimately to 9-11. Iran, today, is among President Bush's triumvirate of the \"Axis of Evil.\" Iranians, to their credit, are in the streets seeking to overthrow the ayatollahs who deny them the freedoms we take for granted.Carter also presided over the \"return\" of the Panama Canal to that nation. The Red Chinese moved in, purchasing facilities at both ends of the Canal built with US dollars and protected for years by US troops. Our control of this most strategic facility between the North and South American continents should never have been abandoned. Carter \"negotiated\" with the North Koreans, thinking, as all liberals do, that if you're just nice enough to Communists, they will keep their word. Today, North Korea continues to threaten South Korea, Japan, and our nation, but now it does so with missiles and a nuclear program. This isn't about 20-20 hindsight. This is about Carter's abject stupidity and Bill Clinton's treachery.In accepting the Nobel Peace Prize, Carter identified the United Nations as the one institution capable of maintaining the peace, ignoring the historic fact that it has been US strength that has enforced whatever peace there is in the world. It was US troops that restrained North Korea when it invaded the South. Thousands of our troops remain there. It was US troops that ended Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. The list of US peacekeeping is long, but the UN has never insured any peace in its 55 years. \"War may sometimes be a necessary evil. But no matter how necessary, it is always an evil, never a good. We will not learn how to live together in peace by killing each other's children,\" said Carter. Wrong. Utterly, totally wrong! Harry Truman, the President who thwarted the North Korean invasion in the 1950s said it best. \"Freedom is still expensive. It still costs money. It still costs blood. It still calls for courage and endurance, not only in soldiers, but in every man and woman who is free and who is determined to remain free.\"There have always been good wars. If the French and Austrians had not stopped the invading Islamic armies in past centuries, all Europe would be speaking Arabic today. If the allies had not stopped the armies of Nazi Germany we would be speaking German today and the Japanese would control all of Asia. The general who led the allies in World War II, Dwight D. Eisenhower, later to serve as US President, said, \"We must be ready to dare all for our country. For history does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid.\"Carter is both weak and timid. His words condemn him, but while accepting the Peace Prize he condemned President Bush's policy of preventative intervention in Iraq, a nation that has defied the UN for more than a decade. Had Hitler's ambitions been thwarted in the 1930's, millions would not have died. Had we not dropped atomic bombs on Japan to end the war in the Pacific, the US would have suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties. If we do not learn the lessons of history, we are condemned to repeat it.Let the Nobel Committee give out its meaningless Peace Prize to the likes of Jimmy Carter, and let the rest of us prepare for a new war whenever and wherever the forces of evil seek to destroy freedom. \n 1992: \"I made it because Franklin Delano Roosevelt energized this nation. I made it because Harry Truman fought for working families like mine. I made it because John Kennedy's rising tide lifted even our tiny boat. I made it because Lyndon Johnson showed America that people who were born poor didn't have to die poor. And I made it because a man with whom I served in the Georgia Senate -- a man named Jimmy Carter -- brought honesty and decency and integrity to public service.\"2004: Democrats \"claimed Carter's pacifism would lead to peace. They were wrong. They claimed Reagan's defense buildup would lead to war. They were wrong. And, no pair has been more wrong, more loudly, more often than the two Senators from Massachusetts, Ted Kennedy and John Kerry.\"\nhttp://www.partialobserver.com/article.cfm?id=653The InvasionOn November 4, 1979 an Iranian Islamic cleric, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, declared war on America when his militant Islamic followers invaded the United States by attacking the sovereign territory of the US embassy in Tehran, kidnapping 52 US diplomats and holding them hostage for 444 days.  The weak and ineffectual response of President Jimmy Carter to this invasion of the United States provided the radical Islamic world with all the evidence it needed to convince itself the West was a culture in decline, and it's leading country, America, could be humiliated and defeated easily, and with impunity. America's failure to respond to the Iranian Invasion of America with a severe and decisive military action was to World War Three what Europe's reaction to Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia was to World War Two - a timid response of appeasement that encouraged imperialistic dreams of world conquest in a sociopathic mentality.http://www.trumanproject.org/trumanpaper3.htmlInstead, the next Presidential contest brought the election of Jimmy Carter, who suffered through four years of well-intentioned misadventures in security policy, deepening the impression that Democrats were hostile to the military and deeply suspicious of American power, not the party you wanted in charge when an international emergency demanded tough action. From the start, Carter sent signals that he would pursue an excuse-me foreign policy. Carter picked Cyrus Vance, perceived by some as \"the closest thing to a pacifist that the U.S. has ever had as Secretary of State\" as his lead diplomat, and Andrew Young, who once suggested, \"it may take the destruction of Western civilization to allow the rest of the world to really emerge as a free and brotherly society,\" as Ambassador to the United Nations. (15)The new president's first foreign policy act, taken within 24 hours of his inauguration, was to order the removal of all nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula. A few days later he followed up by announcing his intention to withdraw all American ground troops from Korea. A host of defense-minded Democratic Senators, including Sam Nunn, Scoop Jackson, John Glenn, and Hubert Humphrey, joined virtually unanimous Republican opposition to the plan to pull the troops out of Korea, and Carter was forced to rescind the idea. Carter then proceeded to cut the seven-year defense budget he inherited from Ford by $57 billion. (16) Later he abruptly canceled the B-1 bomber program shortly before production. As one observer put it, \"If the President had only done something to soften the impact of his announcement on congressional and public attitudes, the troubles and criticism he received probably would not have been so great.\" (17) By the spring of 1979, 62% of Americans thought the U.S.'s position in the world was \"becoming weaker.\" (18)Carter's initial missteps poisoned public perception of his fitness to handle America's security, particularly in the midst of a crisis abroad. After initially rallying around the President in the wake of the Iranian hostage crisis, the public quickly grew impatient with his inability to bring the hostages home safely. When a daring rescue attempt ended in failure, public mistrust of Carter only grew. (19) Similarly, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was blamed on Carter's conciliatory stance toward the Soviet Union. (20) By the end of his four years in office, the American public \"felt bullied by OPEC, humiliated by the Ayatollah Khomeini, tricked by Castro, out-traded by Japan and out-gunned by the Russians.\" (21) The narrative of Democratic incompetence spoiled Carter's foreign policy successes, most notably the Camp David Accords.To be sure, Carter was wise to recognize the security relevance of \"soft\" foreign policy tools such as human rights promotion (the Bush Administration has lately come around to this view itself). But whatever the wisdom of Carter's policies, their political symbolism was disastrous, feeding into the perception that Democrats shy away from projecting American power and leave our security vulnerable. Because Carter's policies were seen as weak, his symbols began to seem weak as well. Concepts like peace, cooperation, and human rights came under Carter to imply weakness. Together, these fueled a negative narrative. Without intending it, Jimmy Carter drove home the notion that Democrats were skeptical of American strength, determined to scale back the military, and too timid to stand up to our enemies' acts of aggression.Like I said, Daewoo, Carter told the Russians we would do nothing if they invaded Afghanistan. He told them with his actions and his weakness. Carter was a military wimp.Come on. Be a man and admit it so we can go on to something important.\n Quote: He wasn&#8217;t ALL bad. He was just a wimp when it came to flexing military muscles. John Kennedy, on the other hand, was a lion. \n Oh, yea, the bay of pigs was definatly the work of a lion...using mercenaries and untrained seperatists because he was so afraid of the US being associated with it.\nSuch tactics have been practiced by other Presidents. The Bay of Pigs was simply a failed effort. The Cuban blockade wherein Kennedy stood up to the Russians was not&#8230;and he didn&#8217;t have to set foot in Cuba to make their missiles disappear. Carter&#8217;s abandonment of the Truman Doctrine (He was the only President, Democrat or Republican, up to that time to do such a stupid thing) set the stage for Russia&#8217;s advance.\n Quote: I have explained my lack of thoroughness in the port mistake. I don&#8217;t know your age, but I&#8217;m wondering if you were still wet behind the ears in the &#8216;70s when Carter was considered BY MANY to have done exactly as I claim. He let the Russians know we would not respond. Regardless of what you claim to be the reason for this opinion, HELD BY MANY, it was indeed true. He was a wimp. \n As I said, 20 million people believe that have been abducted by aliens. The facts do not bear out the opinion that Carter was simply a wimp. In Iran, he supported the Shah.\nHe abandoned the Shah after supporting him. That&#8217;s why the Shah was defeated. He later took the Shah in for medical treatment. Carter was (is) a kind and gentle man. Read above. \nIn Afghanistan, there was no opportunity for containment. It was over before it started. There was no gain for the US in attempting to invade Afghnaistan in order to take the coutnry back, and the expense, incluidng retooling the entire US military for the job, would have been HUGE. We had no way to get our troops into the country, no way to resupply them, and no real chance of vistory since the entire Soviet militarty could be brought to bear in less than 14 days to end any kind of ill advised US intervantion.There will always be those who believe that having the best military in the world is a magic wand that can be waved to make problems go away. They are sorely mistaken. If you can not get you men and equipment into a location, and with enough troopp strenght to secure your method in ingress, you cannot possibly win. If you cannot resupply your troops efficiently, you cannot possibly win. What it comes down to is that we could not possibly have won in Afghanistan. While th US military was certainly better than the Soviet military technologically, we sould almost cetainly have lost in Afghanistan. We chose a long time ago to equip our military with relatively few \"superweapons\" instead of optign to provide weapons that could be quickly and produced and that are cheap enough that we can afford to produce them in quantitiy.

They had complete control of the country, including fortified military postions and already had a complete supply chain in place that they had built for the Afghanis. It was a war that we could not possibly have won.\nThis point has been adequately addressed. We didn&#8217;t have to set foot in Afghanistan to back the Russians down. The lead up to the invasion was quite lengthy. Carter just never showed he had any balls&#8230;whoops, I guess that&#8217;s because he didn&#8217;t&#8230;or was he just too timid to expose himself?\n Quote: That was not his argument. His argument was:Carter's timid approach to international conflicts emboldened the USSR to extend its reach further into the Third World. \n And my argument is that the guy is an idiot. He offers no evidence to back his claims, and th facts do not bear him out. This is why you need to be careful about posting opinion articles as fact...especially opinion articles from obviously biased sources. You have to be careful to check the facts, especially important in your case, where you do not seem to have any in your possession, just unfounded, unsupportable rhetoric.\nYou&#8217;re consideration of the author&#8217;s mental state is no excuse for you&#8217;re manipulation of his words in your previous comments. The fact is, you haven&#8217;t refuted any of the many facts in the first article you attacked, nor have you changed the opinions of several million people regarding Jimmy Carter&#8217;s weakness.By the way, are you aware that Jimmy Carter is the only President in history to file a report of a UFO?&#8230;or that he is afraid of Paws, the killer rabbit?&#8230;and can you imagine that some of his reluctance to show strength came from his chief advisor&#8230;daughter Amy.\nQuote: The Shah was overthrown and exiled. \n He was exiled in the fact that he could nto return to his country. He was NOT forcibly exiled. Your argument does not make any sense here. You seem to be claiing that the Iranians kicked him out of the ocuntry, then a few years later wante him back so badly that they were willing to spit in the eye of the US and face serious sanctions to get hom back. That does not even make any sense. It is illogical. When he fled Iran, he still had comlete control of the military.\nSure he did. Then why didn&#8217;t he simply have his military kill the revolutionists?You want some evidence that Carter abandoned the Shah?http://rescueattempt.tripod.com/id24.htmlI would print parts of that link but there are just two many FACTS presented. Read a few and see if you can dismiss them with something like you did before.\nQuote: Appeasement works better in all cases? \n What appeasement?\nAppeasement by inaction and weak response to threats, appeasement by trying to talk your way out of physical threats and refusing to clinch your own fist in the face of a bully.\nQuote: The &#8220;go ahead&#8221; was not imaginary. \n Yes, it was. Not only was it imaginary, it was not even imagend until 20 yrs after the fact, and was only imagined in the US. Your stance on this does not make sense AT ALL. You are arguing that our handling of Iran, when we did not get directly involved in a POPULAR overthrow somehow sent the Russians a signal that it was OK to overthrow Afghanistan. Lets step into the real world here for just a minute, Jim. The soviets invaded afghanistan becuase the Afghani governemtn had lost control over the islamic fighters in the country. There is no question of that. They were afraid that the islamic militant movement would extend into the islamic population of the USSR, causing an internal conflict. We let it go because there was nothign we could do. The Soviets were untouchable. We also let it go because Carters national security advisor on the DAY of the invasion, came up with the plan to use the war in Afghnaistan as the Soviets Vietnam. Beyond that, we did NOT want Islamic militancy to spread.Carters plan on this, drafted by his NSA, was to keep the soviets fighting the Afghnais for years to come but WITHOUT giving the Afghanis enough resources for a decisive victory in order to bleed out the Soviet Union and DEFINATLY without supporting the Islamic fundamentalists.

Reagan did what Carter was unwilling to, he taught Islamic militants how to defeat a superpower.\nYou&#8217;ve already claimed that the plan to assist the Afghan rebels was Carter&#8217;s advisor&#8217;s plan (seeming to deny it was Carter&#8217;s). Carter was driving the boat&#8230;I believe that was my response the first time we went over this. Carter was therefore not unwilling to teach militants how to defeat a superpower. You are merely pulling your expected tricks of switching the argument. I&#8217;m chasing shadows again&#8230;I&#8217;m seriously considering that lobotomy!",

   "...a wickedly weak and incorrect response. There are many facts in the article. You simply attempt to dismiss the entire article with a flippant remark because you have a differing opinion...and you literally hate to concede a point.Let's see...we had a naval and air power that could have attacked Soviet positions anywhere in the world without setting foot on dry land.\n\n \n And led to full scale war with the soviets. It is one thing to pull off a naval blockade, it is another entirely to actually strike directly at soviet targets. What you are suggesting here is absolute lunacy. That would have been the end fo the world as we knew it...open warefare with the Soviet union, quite possibly ending in nuclear obliteration...over the invations of an already pro-soviet country. That is ABSOLUTLY insane. \n \n \n Deploying them in the Persian Gulf may have had some effect of the Soviets well known intent to invade Afghanistan. As John Kennedy proved, sometimes rattling the sword causes retreat of the enemy. Carter let it be known that he wouldn't even pick it up.\n\n \n We already had 2 carrier battle groups in the persian gulf. How much more do you want? India and Pakistan both denied us the ability to station any troops in either country, fearful of being the front line ins a US soviet war. \n \n \nLike I said, Daewoo, Carter told the Russians we would do nothing if they invaded Afghanistan. He told them with his actions and his weakness. Carter was a military wimp.Come on. Be a man and admit it so we can go on to something important.Such tactics have been practiced by other Presidents. The Bay of Pigs was simply a failed effort. The Cuban blockade wherein Kennedy stood up to the Russians was not...and he didn't have to set foot in Cuba to make their missiles disappear. Carter's abandonment of the Truman Doctrine (He was the only President, Democrat or Republican, up to that time to do such a stupid thing) set the stage for Russia's advance.He abandoned the Shah after supporting him. \n\n \n I am not going to respond to your cut and paste tyrade. If you want to actually post an argument iwth some facts, and use the quote tool properly so I can tell reaosnably when relying what is your comment and what is somebody elses, that is fine. What you are doing here is trying to bury me in other peoples words becuase you are too ignorant of the facts surrounding these events to deabte on your own. \n \n What you are posting is a bunch of unsupported, unsupportable garbage that came out after Carter wont he Nobel peace prize by people who did not think he should have won. Take a look at http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch29ir.html\n \n It is a PEER REVIEWED article about the fall of the Shah from a non partisan source. \n \n The US NEVER pulled its supprot fromt he Shah. Even AFTER he left Iran, we continued to support him and it caused the Iranian hostage crisis. This is where your argument falls flat on its face and proves to be the argument of an ignorant political partisan wntirely lacking logic. If we had pulled supprt form the Shah, WHY did we take him in and grant him asylum? WHY did we not return him to Iran in exchange for the hostages? Simply put, Carter felt that the US had promised the Shah support, and it was time to live up to that promise. That is all there is to it. \n \n Any connection between the loss fo the Shah and the invasion of Afghanistan is simply idiotic. First, we never abandonded the Shah. Second, if we HAD abandoned the Shah, or were percieved as having abandoned the Shah, the argument that this somehow encouraged teh Soviets to INVADE another nation is simply retarded. WE KNOW WHY the soviets invaded Afghanistan. We know becuase the curtain fell a long time ago (thanks a lot more to Jimmy carter than to Ronald Regan) and the Soviets invaded Afghanistan beause they were afraid that with the ISalmic Militants running thing, they would have trouble with their own Islamic population. The Pro soviet governemtn there had fallem, the Sovietsa already had military assetes in teh country,a nd they figured that could invade it quickly and easily nd the problem would be solved. They were right about the invasion wrong about the \"problem solved\" part. Their invasion took less than 3 days, and fewer than 300 Soviets died. They could not control the country after they took it, though.\n \n The kicker to this is that I wish Carter HAD abandoned the Shah. The Shah was a tyrant, and the islamic revolution was wildly popular (80+ percent support). Because of US support and weapons, hundreds of thousands of Iranians were killed. That should not have happened. Iranians had as much right to self determination as anybody. If that large a percentage of the people wanted the Shah out, we should not have tried to help him hold on to power. \n \n The Shah loosing power was only a bad thing if you hold the arrogant view that the US knows what is best for everybody on the planet and that we haev the rigth to force our culture on others. The Iranians saw wester culture and soundly rejected it...just as the Iraqis are now. \n \n Still, any connection made between the actions of the US regarding the internal workings of a third tier nation, and the decision of a super power to invade another nations is just absolutly stupid. There are no two ways about it and there is no nice way to put it. It is nothing but partisan BS, and not even intelligent partisan BS at that. The US would have WITHOUT QUESTION, lost a war in afghanistan, and since it would have essentially been a direct war with the Soviets, it would have been WWIII, and quite possibly the end of the planet earth. \n \n \nThat's why the Shah was defeated. He later took the Shah in for medical treatment. Carter was (is) a kind and gentle man. Read above. This point has been adequately addressed. We didn't have to set foot in Afghanistan to back the Russians down. The lead up to the invasion was quite lengthy. \n \n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Invasion_of_Afghanistan\n \n Educate yourself. The lead up to invasion was lengthy? It was a complete sneak attack. Teh Soviets had troops stationed IN AFGHANISTAN. Soviet technicians were responsible for MAINTENANCE on Afghani equipmet. In fact, the Afghanis were unable to mount any effective defense because the day before the invasion, those same soviet technicians told the Afghani commanders that they had to take the batteries out of all the vehicles for winter maintenance. They removed all the batteries and drained all the acid from them. The next day when the soviets invaded and the Afghani soldiers got in their vehicles, they would not start. \n \n \nOn December 27, 1979 700 troops, including 54 KGB spetsnaz special forces troops from the Alpha Group and Zenith Group, dressed in Afghan uniforms seized all major governmental, military and media buildings in Kabul, including their primary target - the Tajbeg Presidential Palace, where they killed President Hafizullah Amin. That operation began at 7:00 P.M., when the Soviet spetsnaz (Zenith Group) blew up Kabul's communications hub, paralyzing Afghani military command. At 7:15 the storm of Tajbeg Palace began, it lasted 45 minutes. Simultaneously other objects were seized (e.g. the Ministry of Interior at 7:15). The operation was fully completed by the morning of December \n\n \n There was no buildup to the war. We did not even know it had happened until after it was over. It took us several days just to figure out it had been the soviets and not in internal coup, despite the fact that we CIA operatves ont he ground in Afghanistan. The PEOPLE of Afghanistan did not even realize they had been invaded. Most of the MILTARY in Afghanistan did nto know the soviets had invaded until days later. \n \n NOBODY ON THE PLANET had any idea the Soviets were even considering an invasion of Afghanistan, least of all America. The lead up to the invasion was NOT lengthy. Afghanistan was a Russian ALLY. \n \n \n \nSure he did. Then why didn't he simply have his military kill the revolutionists?You want some evidence that Carter abandoned the Shah?http://rescueattempt.tripod.com/id24.htmlI would print parts of that link but there are just two many FACTS presented. Read a few and see if you can dismiss them with something like you did before.\n\n \n He did have the military kill many. At the end of the day, though, if he had the military kill them all, there would have been nothing left but him and the military. You SEVERALY underestimate the popularity of the movement. 80-90% supprt is generally considered an accurate assesment. No ruler, no matter what knd of backing they have, can stand against 80% of their population if they are willing to fight. It is simply not possible.\n \n \nAppeasement by inaction and weak response to threats, appeasement by trying to talk your way out of physical threats and refusing to clinch your own fist in the face of a bully.\n\n \n Doing nothign when there is nothing you can do is not appeasement. wE blinked, and the Soviets had taken over Afghnaistan. It took us days to even figure out it had happened. They basically invaded from within. They did not even move in equipment, they just used the equipment they already had in place. \n \n You answer to the problem makes absolutly no sense. The only option at that point was direct and open warefare with the Soviet union. World War 3, possible planetary obliteration in the name of liberating a country from the soviets that they controlled prior to the invasion. Gee, I wonder why we didn't jump right in and do that? Jim, that is just plain stupid. \n \n A show of force? Against what? Where would we have made this show of force? \n \n \nYou've already claimed that the plan to assist the Afghan rebels was Carter's advisor's plan (seeming to deny it was Carter's). Carter was driving the boat...I believe that was my response the first time we went over this. Carter was therefore not unwilling to teach militants how to defeat a superpower. You are merely pulling your expected tricks of switching the argument. I'm chasing shadows again...I'm seriously considering that lobotomy!\n\n \n Carter was more than willing to teach militants to defeat a super power, just not islamic fundamentalist militants. He sent officers to work with the Northern alliance, a group of anti Soviet, pro western militants. His goal was to use Afghanistan as the Soviets Vietnam, but WITHOUT contributing to the spread of islamic militancy. It is undeniable that the war in Afghanistan led to the downfall of the Soviet Union. It is also undeniable that the spread of Islamic militancy and Islamic fundamentalism has NOT been a good thing. \n \n Considering those two facts, I would say that Carters strategy in Afghanistan was a good one.",

The single shred of credibility that MIGHT have remained vanished in a puff of smoke when, after I pointed out that Afghanistan has no seaport, you came back and tried to argue the point. While ignorance is certainly excusable, surely you can't actually expect me or anybody else to take your opinion on this matter seriosuly?\n \n The problem with debating with somebody with no idea what they are talign about is that I am bound by my knowledge. You, on the other hand, are limited only by your imagnation and whatever crackpot theories you can dig up on theinternet, and we all know there are plenty out there. \n \n \nWe weren't discussing whether the Shah demise was good or bad.

We were discussing whether the Soviets percieved some weakness in Carters response which led them to invade Afghanistan. We now know absolutly that this is false. The soviet had put the mechanisms for invasion in place over 5 yrs before carter was even president. Those mechanisms were disguised as military aid so nobody reconized them for what they were. \n \n \n\n http://fas.org/irp/cia/product/afghanistan/\n \n Apparently you were asleep when all this happened.

Carter was a wimp. It is only in retrospect that we see that his chickeness helped with the collapse od Soviet Russia.

The article you post is essentially looking at the facts 20 yrs later and saying \"we shoud heva recognized what was going on\". Frankly, the authors argument that we should have known what was going on is rediculous. Soviet troop movements, even large ones, iun and out of Afghnaistan took place all the time. They used Afghanistan heavily for training, and they shipped millions of tons of military equipment there every year to assist teh Afghanis in eradicating the islamic fundamentalists. Nearly half the troops in Afghnaistan fighting the muslims were Russian.\n \n The troop movements that this guy claims should have tipped us off were completely normal. The overthrow of the Afghani government actually involved only 700 troops, and was over in less than 3 hours. The entire Afghani government was wrapped up in one night. \n \n As far as your claim that I am trying to do the same, look throught he glass of history and attribute credit inappropriatly, I think you need to read Zbigniew Brzezinski's book as Lord Tammerlin suggests. It is VERY clear that your suggestion here is totally incorrect. Things in Afghanistan pretty much went he way that Brzezinski and Carter planned, with the exception of Reagans contribution to islamic fundamentalism. \n \n You might also read Kissingers \"Years of Upheaval\". It explains the condiitons in the Middle East, including an assesment fo Carters handling of the IRanian situation. Ironically enough, he actually claims that Carter put TOO MUCH suppport behind the Shah, and seems to believe that if we HAD pulled supprot from the Shah, we could have had a powerful ally in the new government of Iran.\n \n You might also read James Bakers \"the politics of Diplomacy\" He gives Carter credit for the downfall of the Soviet Union.\n \n Kissingers \"Diplomacy\" is also a must read if you are at all interested in our support fo Tyrants, the thoughts behind it, and the consequences of those actions. Even Kissinger, ebing the statesman that he is, does not manage to make the lipstick on that pig look convincing.",

Civil war would quickly break out with Iran supporting the Shia and Syria supporting the baathists. This could buy us 5 or ten years before the islamic super sate comes into being. \n \n Alternatively, they could release Saddam, apologize to him for trying to steal his country, and put him command of all the US troops there for the next year. He is the only person in the last 50 yrs who has proven capable of keeping the place in order and out of the hands of the islamic fundies.",

Without that aid, Israel ceases to exist. Their infrasturcture, management, and locaiton is so poor that they have less than zero hope of survival. They are the ultimate example of a welfare state...a nation that would not even exist without the massive welfare payments that they recieve from the US. \n \n So, I hold no animosity towards the palestenians, even the militant ones.

   "Thats because you are emotionally driven and lack the capacity for rational thought.\n \n The fact is the israelis have illegally invaded palestine and are illegally holding it. There have been multiple UNSC reolutions condeming their actions and callign for israel to withdraw from the illegally occupied land. They have outkilled the palestnians over 1000-1 (thats right, 1012 dead palestanians fro every dead israeli). They are murderous, racist tyrants, and the world would be a better place if israel was removed from it.\n\n Illegally invaded Palestine? Jews lived in \"Palestine\" for thousands of years. King David conquered Jerusalem ~1000BC and created Judea and Israel. The Asyrians conquered Israel in 722BC and the babylonians conquered Judea in 586BC. Control bounced around for the next 2000 years.\n The Balfour Declaration created a Jewish territory and a Muslim territory under British control ~1920. The Arabs never accepted the partition. Almost immediately after the Balfour Declaration, Arab nationalists began a bloody campaign of terrorism against Jews in the region. \n The UN partitioned Palestine in 1947, but once again, the Arabs protested. Under the plan, Jerusalem was internationalized, but because it was predominantly Jewish surrounded by Arab cities, the Arabs routinely blocked shipments of food and goods into Jerusalem. \n When Egypt and Syria invaded Jewish territory, the Israeli kicked their asses and created their own boundaries. IMO, when you mess with the bull, sometimes you get the horns. \n \n \n As is, they are here and under international law they have a right, if nto the ability, to exist. They do NOT have the right to illegally occupy palestine. The palestnains meet EVERY definition of \"Freedom fighter\" I have ever seen, regardless of whatever political label might currently be assinged to them. \n \n\n What international law were the Palestinians obeying when they, with the help of Egypt and Syria, invaded Jewish territory as established by the UN?\n And what definition of freedom fighter includes women and little kids used as suicide bombers? IMO, only gutless terrorists send their wives and kids to kill innocent civilians by blowing themselves up.\n \n \n The isralis will hold on and keep the war going becuase despite the fact that EVERY nation in the area has promised them normalized relations if they pull out of palestine, they want the war to continue becuase without it they cannot expect billions in US aid yearly. Without that aid, Israel ceases to exist. Their infrasturcture, management, and locaiton is so poor that they have less than zero hope of survival. They are the ultimate example of a welfare state...a nation that would not even exist without the massive welfare payments that they recieve from the US. \n\n They are also the ultimate example of Arab aggression. The original Balfour Declaration split Palestine into two roughly equal sized pieces, but the greed of the Palestinians and their hatred for Jews prevented them from any equitable split. Well, Israel proved to be no match for the Palestinians, Syrians and Egyptians and kicked all of their asses.emoticon_xgood \n \n\n So, I hold no animosity towards the palestenians, even the militant ones. They have the same right to freedom and self determination that everybody else has. The fact that some Americans, yourself included, are currently unhappy with the idea of certain groups having freedom or being bale to exercise self determination, I still believe in the concept.\n\n \n I'd love to see a peaceful resolution to the Palestinian issue but we both know that the Arab world won't rest as long as their are Jews in the Middle East. The recent comments from Iran's leader underscores that fact. Until Muslims in the region can learn to co-exist with Jews and Christians, long-term peace is an impossibility.",

   "WOW. You need a history lesson BAD. Egypt, Syria, and Jordan did NOT attack Israel leading up to the 6 day war. Israel attacked THEM. \n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War\n \n\n \n You need a more credible source than Wikipedia. It has come under attack recently for false entries. The first act of war was the closing of the Straits of Tiran by Egypt. It's true that Israel launched a pre-emptive strike following that, however. Below are a couple of good references.\n \n\n THE 1967 WAR \n In May 1967, Egypt and Syria took a number of steps which led Israel to believe that an Arab attack was imminent. On May 16, Nasser ordered a withdrawal of the United Nations Emergency Forces (UNEF) stationed on the Egyptian-Israeli border, thus removing the international buffer between Egypt and Israel which had existed since 1957. On May 22, Egypt announced a blockade of all goods bound to and from Israel through the Straits of Tiran. Israel had held since 1957 that another Egyptian blockade of the Tiran Straits would justify Israeli military action to maintain free access to the port of Eilat. Syria increased border clashes with Israel along the Golan Heights and mobilized its troops. \n \n The U.S. feared a major Arab-Israeli and superpower confrontation and asked Israel to delay military action pending a diplomatic resolution of the crisis. On May 23, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson publicly reaffirmed that the Gulf of Aqaba was an international waterway and declared that a blockade of Israeli shipping was illegal. In accordance with U.S. wishes, the Israeli cabinet voted five days later to withhold military action. \n \n The U.S., however, gained little support in the international community for its idea of a maritime force that would compel Egypt to open the waterway and it abandoned its diplomatic efforts in this regard. On May 30, President Nasser and King Hussein signed a mutual defense pact, followed on June 4 by a defense pact between Cairo and Baghdad. Also that week, Arab states began mobilizing their troops. Against this backdrop, Nasser and other Egyptian leaders intensified their anti-Israel rhetoric and repeatedly called for a war of total destruction against Israel. \n \n Arab mobilization compelled Israel to mobilize its troops, 80 percent of which were reserve civilians. Israel feared slow economic strangulation because long-term mobilization of such a majority of the society meant that the Israeli economy and polity would be brought to a virtual standstill. Militarily, Israeli leaders feared the consequences of absorbing an Arab first strike against its civilian population, many of whom lived only miles from Arab-controlled territory. Incendiary Arab rhetoric threatening Israel's annihilation terrified Israeli society and contributed to the pressures to go to war. \n \n Against this background, Israel launched a pre-emptive strike against Egypt on June 5, 1967 and captured the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip. Despite an Israeli appeal to Jordan to stay out of the conflict, Jordan attacked Israel and lost control of the West Bank and the eastern sector of Jerusalem. Israel went on to capture the Golan Heights from Syria. The war ended on June 10. \n http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570433/Six-Day_War.html\n \n\n \n \n\n ......\n In April 1967, after Syria heavily shelled Israeli villages from the Golan Heights, Israel and Syria engaged in aerial clashes. Israel shot down six of Syria's MiG fighter planes, which were given by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Israel warned Syria against future attacks, and both the Syrians and Soviets were alarmed by the warning. Syria appealed to Nasser for backing, and in mid-May the Egyptian army moved 100,000 troops and 1000 tanks into the Sinai Peninsula on Israel's southern border. The United Nations (UN) had earlier stationed forces in the area as observers, but on May 17, Nasser called for the removal of UN personnel from several locations. Within days, all of the observers were removed. On May 22 Nasser announced the closure of the Strait of Tiran, a vital shipping corridor for Israel with links to the Red Sea and major sources of petroleum. A similar closure of the strait had been a major cause of the Suez Crisis in 1956; Israel had made clear since then that it would regard another closure as an act of war. Israel was further alarmed when Egypt and Jordan signed a treaty placing the two armies under a joint command. Despite a flurry of diplomatic effort, war seemed inevitable.\n \n \n Because Israel feared fighting on three fronts (Egyptian, Jordanian, and Syrian), and because it preferred that fighting take place in Arab rather than Israeli territory, Israel decided to strike first. On the morning of June 5 the Israeli air force attacked Egypt, the largest force in the region. The timing of the attack, 8:45 am, was designed to catch the maximum number of Egyptian aircraft on the ground and to come when the Egyptian high command was stuck in traffic between homes and military bases. The Israeli aircraft took evasive measures to elude Egyptian radar and approached from directions that were not anticipated. The surprise was complete. Within hours of the strike, the Israelis, who focused their attacks on military and air bases, had destroyed 309 of the 340 total combat aircraft belonging to the Egyptians. Israeli ground forces then moved into the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip, where they fought Egyptian units. Egyptian casualties were heavy, but Israel suffered only minimal casualties.\n \n War was not far behind on Israel's eastern front. Israel had conveyed a message to King Hussein of Jordan asking him to stay out of the conflict, but on the first morning of the war Nasser called Hussein and encouraged him to fight. Nasser reportedly told Hussein that Egypt had been victorious in the morning's fighting-an illusion the Egyptian public believed for several days. At 11:00 am Jordanian troops attacked the Israeli half of Jerusalem with mortars and gunfire and shelled targets in the Israeli interior. Israel's air force, having immobilized the Egyptian air force, turned its attention to Jordan. By evening, the Jordanian air force had been largely destroyed, again with minimal Israeli casualties. At midnight Israeli ground forces attacked Jordanian troops in Jerusalem, and by the morning of June 6, Israeli troops had nearly encircled the city.\n \n On the second day of the war the Israeli air force continued its operations against Arab air bases, raising the total number of destroyed Arab planes to 416, which included more than two-thirds of the Syrian air force. With nearly total control of the skies, Israeli fighter planes and bombers were free to support the tank and infantry forces on the ground. Thus Jordanian reinforcements were prevented from reaching Jerusalem, and by 10:00 am on June 6 the Israelis had taken the Western Wall, also known as the Wailing Wall, in the Old City, the holiest site in Judaism. It was the first time in nearly 2000 years that Jews had controlled the wall. Ground battles continued in the Sinai, where Egypt's armies fell back in the face of Israeli advances. On the third day of the war, June 7, Jordanian forces were pushed from the West Bank across the Jordan River. The UN arranged a cease-fire between Israel and Jordan that went into effect that evening.\n \n The following day, June 8, Israeli forces reached the Suez Canal. As artillery battles continued along the front, the Israeli air force decimated retreating Egyptians, who were backed up on the few roads through desert mountain passes. As the Sinai shifted to Israeli control, Israel turned its forces toward the Golan Heights. There, on June 9, Israel began a difficult assault up steep terrain against entrenched Syrian forces. Israel sent an armored corps into the front of Syrian lines while infantry forces surrounded the Syrian positions. The balance of power soon shifted to Israel's favor, and at 6:30 pm on June 10, Israel and Syria made a cease-fire agreement. Israel controlled all of the Golan Heights, including parts of Mount Hermon. Fighting between Israel and Egypt did not formally end for many years, although Israel controlled the Sinai Peninsula. Not until the 1979 Camp David Accords did the two countries finally reach peace.\n IV Aftermath \n The speed and scope of Israel's victory were devastating to the Arabs, who had expected victory. Egypt, Jordan, and Syria lost almost all of their air forces and much of their armed weaponry. About 10,000 Egyptians were killed in Sinai and Gaza alone, compared with 300 Israeli casualties on that front. In all, Egypt lost about 11,000 troops, Jordan lost about 6000, Syria lost about 1000, and Israel lost 700. As a result, Arab leaders endured unpopularity at home while Israel's government, which had united before and during the war, surged in popularity. Abroad, the USSR, which had strongly supported the Arab powers, was embarrassed because the Arab nations had been defeated by an ally of the United States and Soviet weapons systems had failed to overpower Western weapons.\n\n \n \n\n As far as we know, there was not a single palestenian involved in the 6 day war. The Jordanians held palestine at the time, and it was jordanian troops that engaged the israelis in their war of agression. Most of the palestenains left the area. Palestenians are not arabs. They are a distincitve ethnic group. They do not even LOOK like arabs.\n\n \n Really? Who controlled the Gaza Strip at the time?\n \n\n \"The second dangerous point is the Gaza Strip which has now been taken over by the Palestine Liberation Army, a part of the force of the United Arab Republic. This army is composed of men devoted-and fanatically and sincerely devoted -to what they believe to be the liberation of their homeland. They are there now in the Gaza strip with 300,000 Palestinian refugees. If there could a more explosive situation than that, I do not know what it could be.\"\n Canadian Prime Minister L.B. Pearson in the House of Commons, May 24/67 \n \n\n \n No Palestinian involvement, eh? emoticon_rolleyes \n \n\n The 6 days war was a HORRIBLE defeat for the Israeli army. The chain of command broke down completely and Israeli units started trying to do a land grab. In six days they not only managed to loose over 80% of their own equipment, they lost $17 billion worth of equipment and supplies that the US airlifted to them. \n They completely outran their supply lines, and by the time the US called an end to the war, Israeli troops in Egypt had to abandon their equipment and WALK back to israel because they were out of fuel and had no way to get more. \n \n When the US ended the war, Israel did not have enough ammunition left to fight.

We need more losses like that. emoticon_xgood \n The \"Tantrum\" as you call it was a first-class asswhoopin' IMO. \n \n If you don't like that one, try this one, it's an excellent synopsis of the events leading up to and during the war.\n \n http://www.yahoodi.com/peace/sixdaywar.html\n \n \n\n If they are not going to allow the Palestenian authorities to have any weapons, they cannot really be held responsible if they cannot keep the peace, can they?\n\n Maybe THEY should have thought of that before making the biggest Palestinian terrorist in the world the leader of the Palestinian Authority. \n \n\n The palestenian suicide bombers are voluntary combatants.

As the Vietnam War intensified in 1965 and 1966, so, too, did the Chinese commitment to the survival of North Vietnam. By the spring of the latter year, some 50,000 Chinese troops served in North Vietnam, a total that may have tripled before China began to withdraw its forces in 1968. Until President Johnson limited ROLLING THUNDER to southern North Vietnam, effective April 1, 1968, China gave refuge to North Vietnamese fighters when airfields in the North came under aerial attack, and reports surfaced of Chinese pilots flying North Vietnamese interceptors.

The fear of having a million US troops at your back door makes for strange alliances.\n \n http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/vietnam.htm\n \n Consider this one.\n \n\n The Myth of Inevitable U.S. Defeat in Vietnam \n Reviewed by Nathan Alexander\n 16 December 2005\n ...........\n 6. Adequate Chinese threat: The key to Walton's book is his argument that the threat of Chinese intervention in the war was neither probable, nor in the event it was real, of as much concern as U.S. policy makers imagined it to be. The PRC (People's Republic of China), Walton argues, \n \n \"was an available bogeyman that reassured Johnson, McNamara and other U.S. policy makers who were reluctant to take robust action in Vietnam that their course was the only prudent one. Civilian policy makers consistently chose to ignore the advice of the JCS (Joint Chiefs of Staff) and others who argued that China's ability to project military power effectively into Vietnam was minimal. U.S. leaders usually preferred to be highly cautious and assume that the PRC possessed enormous military capabilities and the will to fight a costly war in Indochina. They had overlearned from the experience in Korea, and did not give sufficient weight to the PRC's many known military-political problems or realistically consider the problems that the PLA would have in projecting power into Indochina (p. 94).\"Walton argues that the delusion of the \"China threat\" was what permitted the U.S. to continue refusing to resolve its contradictory objectives in South Vietnam. In fact the \"threat\" of China conveniently transformed Johnson's waffling and irresolution into the rhetorical \"calculation of force and diplomacy,\" which came to be associated with Robert McNamara. The mixture of military \"pressure,\" political theatrics and hidden diplomacy were all a sort of alchemy believed to manifest a \"secret formula\" which would transform incoherence into victory. \n http://www.intellectualconservative.com/article4820.html\n \n\n and from \n \n\n \n REPORT ON INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP \n \"NEW EVIDENCE ON CHINA, SOUTHEAST ASIA, AND THE VIETNAM WAR\" \n \n Priscilla Roberts \n \n \n On January 11 and 12, 2000, the University of Hong Kong and the Cold War International History Project held the second of what it is hoped will be a series of collaborative international meetings on the Cold War. Over two dozen scholars from China, Vietnam, Russia, the United States, Israel, and Europe gathered at the University of Hong Kong to present and discuss their most recent research findings on \"China, Southeast Asia, and the Vietnam War.\" Within the University of Hong Kong, the organizers were the Centre of Asian Studies, the Centre of American Studies, and the Department of History. Financial sponsorship was provided by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation; the Smith-Richardson Foundation; and the Louis Cha Fund for East-West Studies of the University of Hong Kong.\n ...........\n Three papers dealt in detail with Chinese aid to Vietnam during the war, including the controversial issue of whether China deliberately delayed the trans-shipping of Soviet aid shipments to Vietnam. Drawing on Railway Administration archives, Li Danhui, of the Contemporary China Institute, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, suggested any such delays were bureaucratic rather than political in nature. She also pointed out that, although China pressured Vietnam to make a peace settlement in the 1969-1973 period, Chinese aid to Vietnam simultaneously increased, in the expectation that this would facilitate a later North Vietnamese takeover of the south. Qu Aiguo of the Academy of Military History provided an overview of Chinese military assistance from 1958 to 1973, arguing that the contribution of both supplies and military \"volunteer\" personnel was substantial. Zhang Shuguang of the University of Maryland suggested that the Chinese contribution to Vietnam was relatively limited and, in a theme taken up in later papers, that Chinese policy was relatively cautious and designed to avoid any full-scale war with the United States.http://hkuhist2.hku.hk/amstudies/Report.htm\n \n\n \n \n\n The chinese finally removed the last of their troops right after the Tet offensive, when the NV regular army had essentialy been disbanded in favor of guerilla warfare. \n \n You need to read Kissinger. Nixon was scared to death that the Chinese would jump heavily into the fray and boot the US right out of SE Asia. They threatened to do so on several occasions, including massing more then a million troops at the NV border.\n\n \n I guess one can only conclude that Kissinger wasn't very astute. China's military hardware consisted of 50's and 60's old Russian equipment and AK-47 knock offs, they wanted to normalize relations with the US, they distrusted the USSR more than the US and Vietnam was a traditional enemy of China.

Palestine was among the several former Ottoman Arab territories which were placed under the administration of Great Britain under the Mandates System adopted by the League of Nations pursuant to the League's Covenant (Article 22) . \n \n All but one of these Mandated Territories became fully independent States, as anticipated. The exception was Palestine where, instead of being limited to \"the rendering of administrative assistance and advice\" the Mandate had as a primary objective the implementation of the \"Balfour Declaration\" issued by the British Government in 1917, expressing support for \"the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people\". \n \n During the years of the Palestine Mandate, from 1922 to 1947, large-scale Jewish immigration from abroad, mainly from Eastern Europe took place, the numbers swelling in the 1930s with the notorious Nazi persecution of Jewish populations. Palestinian demands for independence and resistance to Jewish immigration led to a rebellion in 1937, followed by continuing terrorism and violence from both sides during and immediately after World War II. Great Britain tried to implement various formulas to bring independence to a land ravaged by violence. In 1947, Great Britain in frustration turned the problem over to the United Nations. \n http://www.un.org/Depts/dpa/ngo/history.html\n \n\n \n \n \n Point 2: It's too late to compensate the non-nomadic Native Americans practicably now, hence the use of the term \"should have\" in my prior response.",

We bombed the XXXX out of N vietnam, and the enemy just shifted their supply infrastructure. We bombd some more, and they shifted some more. What they were senfding against US troops in S vietnam was not the bulk of thei force, they were rotating units in and out of their rear areas, and still putting up an effective front. Moving US troops into N vietnam to face the full force of the N vietnamese military and guerilla units would have been condeming those men to death. \n \n There was no real possibility of establishign and holding a beachhead or staging area becuase our transport in and out of the area was just as limited as enemy transport in and out of S vietnam. There was a lot of ground to cover and not a lot of good ways to cover it. Additionally, the advancing force always operates at a disadvantage because, short of human wave attacks, they have to stop and deal with every threat. We sotrmed beaches and overran positions in WWII. We found quickly that it could easily cost you 1000 men to take a position being held by as few as 50 enemy soldiers that were dug in and prepared to hold their ground.

Our Air Calvary was fairly effective, however, in quickly getting troops to the battlefield and out again. \n\n \n Yes, but they were also limited to the amount of troops that could be transported and the timeframe for transport. They could not get enough men in quickly enough to establish a secured location for future landing, so it was all scoot in, drop, and scoot out. Even \"secured\" landing zones were not generally controlled by our troops, they were just so far from the action that the NV could not get people there fast enough to attack them.\n \n \nNo argument there.

Since then, NOBODY has ever managed to defeat a guerilla enemy. It simply does not happen. It is like trying to fight air. You have to decide whether it is worth it to wage the war. In some cases, it probably is. In the case of Vietnam, I would say not. We were interfereing with the free choice of the South vietnamese...denying them self determination. \n \n The British had as close to a victory when fighting the IRA as anybody ever has when confronting a guerilla force, and in the end they decided it was just not worth the fight, and both sides made some concessions.
