There is no question that corporations are a little too cozy with the federal government but that's what you get when you have so few guys calling the shots for an entire nation.

Yes, some of the debated issues have changed but the overall philosophy is pretty much the same and at the end of the day I still get less services from the federal government than from Google (borrowed this gem from Daewoo) and yet pay a lot for it. \n \n I wish people would see the reality of our situation without resorting to preconceived bias. The GOP has some really bad ideas but their base actually has some really good ideas. The GOP is also fantastic at organization while the Dems are just awful. On the other hand the Dems have some really bad ideas but their base has some good ideas. For example, it is a good idea that we don't let poor people just starve to death or receive no medical care. Another good idea is to tax the rich so we can actually pay our bills. Another good idea is to slash the defense budget. The GOP has good ideas about balancing the budget and creating more free trade. \n \n I'm not saying \"can't we all just get along\" but you'd think we could at least see things for what they are.

   "Not at the time they weren't. Whether an idea is conservative or liberal is relative to what point in time you are. Conservative back in the 1700s would be to go with what England was doing. Liberal would be to form a new-ish style of government. Liberal today would be to try a different form of government or to modify what was created and conservative would be to keep with the style of government set up at the beginning. \n \n Why do you think \"conservative\" and \"liberal\" mean something different in every country? Good grief, I even posted the definitions of the words for you.\n\n \n That's exactly the point. Brutus claims that the Founders were Conservatives, by your own definition they were not. They formed a NEW government , one unlike What they had in Britain. The Founders were Liberal in their Views. Conservatives ( and by that I mean Republicans in Office) do not want to Keep what was formed well over 200 years ago, they were after all a huge part of what our Government has evolved into over the course of the nations history. They were fine with How everything was as long as they were in charge, but when they got Obama they suddenly cry \" We want our Country back\".. \n \n If your Definition of Conservative is one who would keep the form of Government that was originally formed then we have no Conservatives in this country. The only politician I think would even come close is Ron Paul and he's just a radical politician who can't make up his mind what he wants.",

I didn't say it didn't need to be cut as with Medicare, but It's not the answer to balancing the budget as the GOP would have you believe. If the Government would leave Social security alone instead of raping it to pay other expenditures the program would pay for itself . The High unemployment rate is more of a problem than social security considering the number of workers who are no longer paying into FICA. With Unemployment up and millions out of work sure the revenues are going to cause shortages in many areas, Social Security being one.

In fact, it is the most rapid growth in our budget YTY. \n \n \n It only grows because currently the Government has not done enough to fix the unemployment problem . It's not impossible, it's just that no one is willing to do what is necessary to get it done. We could Raise taxes back to 1999 levels, cut Defense spending and some other un-needed areas and with job growth we could eventually balance the budget. Of course we would have to End the current Wars , which it seems will never happen.\n \n \n\n Yeah, that's it. Cost of wars in FY10 = $165 billion. Bush Tax cuts (estimated) = $150 billion. Total savings possible = $315 billion. \n \n \n The Current Cost of Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq is now .. 1,206,454,543,762 .00 , and this doesn't factor in costs that are accumulated because of the War such as Medical Care for Veterans coming home. Now tack on the War in Libya and other military expenditures and you start to get much bigger numbers than you posted. \n \n \n\n GREAT! You have $1.7 trillion to go.

Frivolous spending , Lost revenues, Wars, and just plain Government Ignorance is what put us here, and it's just ignorant to keep blaming everything on Social Security and Medicare. \n \n \n\n Yes they do. The federal government has the power to legislate to its agencies which is what Section 3 did. It does not define marriage for any state or official purpose. \n\n \n No they don't. They don't have the authority to determine anything to do with a state affair, such as Marriage. They don't have the authority to define Marriage for Federal Purposes, which they did with DOMA.\n \n \n\n And section 2 doesn't define marriage it relates to the power of the states. If you're gonna comment on what I said you might want to be familiar with the law: http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=104_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ199.104\n \n SEC. 2. POWERS RESERVED TO THE STATES.\n SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE. \n\n \n They Define Marriage for Federal Purposes as the union of a man and a woman Which is specifically against the Constitution. They didn't have the authority to define marriage at a Federal Level. \n \n DOMA Section 2 relieves states of a constitutional obligation to enforce judicial custody, alimony or other orders made in other states that involve recognition of same-sex marriages.\n \n DOMA's Section 3 prevents the federal government from recognizing the validity of same-sex marriages.\n \n \n\n Actually, it merely states what the Full Faith and Credit clause already implies. This clause does not mean a state can impose its way onto other states. Furthermore, it is Section 2 that talks about states. \n \n \n No you're right, The Clause doesn't say that. The Full Faith And Credit Clause Before DOMA was put there so that States , under Law, had to recognize certain legal documents from other states. If a Man and woman got married in Florida under a Florida License and then moved to Georgia, then Georgia under the constitution had to recognize that Marriage License as a legal and binding document. The Conservatives feared this would allow for Gays to marry in states that allowed Gay marriage and then move to any state they wanted, so Section 2 was added to release the states of this obligation. Maybe YOU should know the Law a bit more . \n \n \n\n Could you do me a favor and remind me which president attacked Libya? Which president increased the war in Afghanistan this past year? \n \n \n I never once said Obama was without fault.\n \n \n\n Could you remind me again which party had control of the House, 59 seats in the Senate, and the presidency yet extended the Bush tax cuts AND cut payroll taxes to problems that are, in fact, bankrupting us?\n\n \n You would have too if you had a gun to your head. The GOP held a virtual Gun to Obamas head and used the economy and the welfare of the American People as a bargaining Chip to extend those cuts. If the People in this country hadn't had a brain fart in November last year those Cuts would have expired on time.\n \n \n\n Perhaps you can identify the president who now supports wiretapping and is currently in office? What party is this president with?\n\n \n Same as above. Obama unfortunately has his hands tied at the moment by the GOP/Teabag Association. I suspect we'll get much of the same for the next year or so until the next election. Either way it goes I also suspect we will end up with a one Party Government and maybe, just maybe they will get something done. But as long as we have ignorant XXXXXX in Congress who want to take us back 200 years we all may as well move to Canada.",

   "I don't need a calculator to tell me that Social Security is not our problem. I didn't say it didn't need to be cut as with Medicare, but It's not the answer to balancing the budget as the GOP would have you believe. If the Government would leave Social security alone instead of raping it to pay other expenditures the program would pay for itself . The High unemployment rate is more of a problem than social security considering the number of workers who are no longer paying into FICA. With Unemployment up and millions out of work sure the revenues are going to cause shortages in many areas, Social Security being one. But There are ways to deal with the budget without going to Privatization or completely eliminating The Program as the GOP wants to do. And no I'm not retarded.\n \n I've read all I want to about Social security. Most of these are written by people who are supporting the Lies that Social Security is Bankrupting America. If there's one thing I know about the GOP/Teabaggers it's that they don't do Math and they don't use facts.. They use Fear , which is what they have been doing for years trying to Privatize Social Security.\n \nAlready backtracking I see. Now you're only referring to Social Security instead of both SS and Medicare? Now, you say \" leave Social security alone instead of raping it to pay other expenditures the program would pay for itself\". Wrong. What do you think SS money is invested in? US TREASURIES. This is by law. You want to take a stab at who issues those? The way I see it you can either use the money to buy treasuries (the way it was set up in the SS Act), literally leave it there where it gains no value/interest and goes bankrupt, invest in outside markets aka privatize (something you're against). Don't give me this BS that SS is \"mismanaged\". It is managed as required by law. If you don't like that than you problem IS with the program. \n \n \nIt only grows because currently the Government has not done enough to fix the unemployment problem . It's not impossible, it's just that no one is willing to do what is necessary to get it done. We could Raise taxes back to 1999 levels, cut Defense spending and some other un-needed areas and with job growth we could eventually balance the budget. Of course we would have to End the current Wars , which it seems will never happen. \nLet's see, I do the math for you and you basically close your eyes and go \"NO\". Way to think it through. \n \n \n The Current Cost of Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq is now .. 1,206,454,543,762 .00 , and this doesn't factor in costs that are accumulated because of the War such as Medical Care for Veterans coming home. Now tack on the War in Libya and other military expenditures and you start to get much bigger numbers than you posted. \nThe budget is on a yearly basis. You can't balance a budget that is already over. I gave you the previous year costs for all programs you mentioned (a good indicator of next years numbers) and showed you without a doubt how that would not balance the budget. \n \n Can you dispute any of my numbers?\n \n \nSo we cut 50 to 75 % of the remaining budget items, without increased revenues it's all pointless anyway.\nI already gave you a tax increase. How much more did you want? Raise it another 10% for the rich (the only realistic place to do so [those making over $500k]) and you get somewhere in the neighborhood of another $100-200 billion I believe. \n \n \nWhat I said, and still say, is that Social Security and Medicare are NOT the reason we are in this mess to begin with.\nYes, it is. The GAO says it is. The CBO says it is. My math showing you how the wars and \"frivolous spending\" are peanuts in comparison says it is. When 55% of your budget is mandatory spending (which most is SS and Medicare) AND is the biggest YTY increase in your budget than perhaps that's the reason.\n \n So logic, math, GAO, CBO on my side. Your basis opinion on your side. \n \n \n \n \nNo they don't. They don't have the authority to determine anything to do with a state affair, such as Marriage. They don't have the authority to define Marriage for Federal Purposes, which they did with DOMA.\nIt isn't a state affair. It specifically says for federal agencies. The states can define it as they wish. Your position would be that the federal government cannot define words for its own purpose or that the federal government cannot have dealings with something it doesn't have authority over? In the first we basically through out every law we've created. In the later we no longer have \"married filing jointly\" on the 1040 along with removing half the laws we have. \n \n Let me ask you this. Can the federal government pass a law requiring federal agencies to get audited? \n \n \nThey Define Marriage for Federal Purposes as the union of a man and a woman Which is specifically against the Constitution. They didn't have the authority to define marriage at a Federal Level. \nDo they have the authority to define \"high-speed rail\" at a federal level? Transportation is normally a state function. If the federal government wanted to grant money to states building \"high-speed rail\" and it defines it a certain way it seems this would be a violation in your book. \n \n \nNo you're right, The Clause doesn't say that. The Full Faith And Credit Clause Before DOMA was put there so that States , under Law, had to recognize certain legal documents from other states. If a Man and woman got married in Florida under a Florida License and then moved to Georgia, then Georgia under the constitution had to recognize that Marriage License as a legal and binding document. \nWRONG. This was never the meaning of this provision. Licenses are a good example of this. I have a CPA license for exam yet that is not valid in other states nor are they required by the constitution to be valid. Why? Because states have different rules and if one state has rules that go against the rules of another state than the license doesn't have to recognized. \n \n The true meaning of the statue is not what you are referring to here. \n \n Here ya go: Full Faith and Credit for Dummies by Ralph Whitten :: SSRN\n \"Full Faith and Credit for Dummies\"\n \n Seems appropriate for those of you who don't get it.\n \n \nYou would have too if you had a gun to your head. The GOP held a virtual Gun to Obamas head and used the economy and the welfare of the American People as a bargaining Chip to extend those cuts. If the People in this country hadn't had a brain fart in November last year those Cuts would have expired on time.\nA gun to their head? The democrats had HUGE majorities in CONGRESS and the PRESIDENCY. What were the republicans going to do? Seems like you support a party of cowards.",

Don't give me this BS that SS is \"mismanaged\". It is managed as required by law. If you don't like that than you problem IS with the program.\n\n \n In the Social Security system, the money you pay into the system gets immediately paid back out to the people who are currently getting Social Security checks. They then buy U.S. Treasury bonds with the surplus. Essentially, the government (in the form of the Social Security Administration) loans the surplus to itself. When it comes time to start drawing on the collected surplus, the government will pay itself back through tax revenue (or additional borrowing). The Social Security system will start cashing in the bonds, and the government will have to make good on them with tax revenue.\n \n So basically what we have now is that the Government has squandered the Surplus as well as lowered incoming revenues, so when the Social Security System is cashing in those Bonds the Government is having to borrow more because under the Law they have to make good on those bonds. They are using the Social Security Surplus as a running Bank account . I remember when Clinton and Gore wanted to pass a Bill to Stop the Government from using the Social Security Surplus as a bank, but the GOP as well as some Democrats threw a fit and said no. Now they are reaping what they sowed, and placing all the blame on a program that was designed to pay for itself. \n \n Factor in the High unemployment and the Low taxes and of course it's going to cause a shortfall in the program. It does need to be restructured, by Locking it away so the Government doesn't have the authority to spend Social Security Revenues on anything but Social Security.\n \n Medicare I agree is a different Monster all together. I haven't read up a lot on Medicare and how it's actually supposed to work so to be honest I can't say one way or another . I realize it is a huge part of our budget, but I believe a lot of the excessive spending could be eliminated with more strict guidelines and more regulation. That of course would mean... Oh don't say it... More Government Jobs, but it's what is needed for Medicare to work in my opinion. If they don't want to do that then it should be eliminated and then let the states decide individually how they want to manage their Medical care for the Poor and Middle class. \n \n Universal Heath-care comes to mind. \n \n I'll reply to your other quotes later.. this one took more time than I have at the moment.",

They are using the Social Security Surplus as a running Bank account . \nFirst, the program is NOT designed to pay for itself when looking at the federal government as a whole. I don't think you understand what a US treasury bill is. It is debt. You don't issue treasuries unless you need money. Clinton had a surplus in part because of \"borrowing\" from social security. Social Security is REQUIRED BY LAW to purpose treasures. \n \n You are correct that Clinton wanted to put the \"surpluses\" aside for Social Security...thus the \"lockbox\" idea. \n \n Think about what you are proposing though. If the government does not raid Social Security...something every president has done since the program started because the program is DESIGNED that way...than it literally sits there and is devalued. I suppose they could use general fund money to \"pay interest\" but this is just silly. \n \n I'd honestly like to hear what YOU think they should do with the Social Security Trust fund since purchasing treasuries is not an option you like.\n \n ***PART YOU SHOULD READ***\n More importantly, we already spent the entire social security surplus. So regardless of what we do from here on out we HAVE to pay back those treasuries. Starting this year we aren't taking in more money than we spend out of SS (excluding interest). This means money from the General Fund (aka your income taxes) has to be used to payback treasuries which pays SS benefits. THIS IS THE PROBLEM. More and more General Fund money will be used to payback treasuries to pay SS benefits. This crowds out other programs because NOT ONLY do you not have Social Security surpluses to raid but you are actually paying back treasuries. \n \n So you talk about \"locking it away\" which is fine for the future but the damage is done. When Daewoo and I (who apparently are the only two on this forum who get this) talk about the problem with social security it is the payback of the treasuries that we see as the problem. Do you see the difference? \n \n So when someone talks about privatizing, this is \"for the future\". They never explain how they'll pay for what was already borrowed. When you talk about raising the retirement age, THAT actually does help because you defer payments/pay less over life thus using less general fund money per year to pay back treasuries held by SS Trust Fund. \n \n \nFactor in the High unemployment and the Low taxes and of course it's going to cause a shortfall in the program.\n SS is not projects to run a surplus anymore (excluding interest)...\n \n \nMedicare I agree is a different Monster all together.

You don't know. I, however, do know. Sadly, it is much more of a problem than Social Security.\n \n Medicare is tricky because you have Part A,B,C, and D. \n Here is good overview of funding:\n http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11396.pdf\n \n In short:\n A = Funded by your payroll tax (2.9%)\n B = Funded by premiums and general fund money (your income taxes)\n C = A mix of A and B...complicated\n D= Same as B",

It won't pay for itself when the ammount of Revenues coming in is lower than the ammount of benefits to be paid, which is where we are now. The Surplus was set up to Pay Social Security benefits in times when the Revenues were short. The Money left over after current benefits are paid goes into the surplus, the Government then issues securities on said surplus which by Law they have to pay back if and when the Social security revenues fall short of meeting current payout. The Problem is that they borrow from Social Security to pay other expenditures, and when Social security comes calling to cash in some of those securities then the Government has to borrow more to pay what is owed.

They use the Social Security as a Bank and run it dry, and then when it's time to face the consequence they blame the program for their budget shortfall.

I don't have a problem when they borrow Money from Social security to pay other bills, I have a problem when they whine about paying it back and then try to blame the program when the money runs out. yeah it's a huge, Huge part of the government Debt, but it's only so because the Government made it a problem.\n \n \n\n I'd honestly like to hear what YOU think they should do with the Social Security Trust fund since purchasing treasuries is not an option you like.\n \n \n Ok, Well short of Putting the surplus away like Above there are some things they could do NOW to help get the debt under control... I'll start with this...\n \n The current FICA rate is 7.65% (6.2% for social security tax and 1.45% for medicare tax) for employers\n and 5.65% (4.2% for social security tax and 1.45% for medicare tax) for employees. \n The wage limit for 2011 for social security is $106,500.00 (maximum withholding is $4,485.60). \n There is no wage limit for medicare.\n \n This was one of Obamas brain farts.. Lowering the Employee FICA rate by 2% . Now the Government is making up that 2% by borrowing or using Income Tax revenues to make up the difference.\n \n I would start by Going back to the same level as it's been since the 90's 7.65% for both employee and Employer. Depending on what is done about Medicare , for instance if they eliminate it all together, then that 1.45 % going to medicare now can be rolled into Social Security. If not then maybe even a 1% increase across the board .\n I would then increase the wage limit to 120,000.00. and increase the maximum withholding as well. \n Then increase the age of retirement to 70, and not phase it in over 30 years but increase it NOW. Sure there's going to be some angry 69 year olds but oh well we got bills to pay. \n a restructure of the program guidelines would also help more than they realize. Right now drawing SSD is about as easy as telling your doctor you can't work and getting a few reports from him saying you can't. More Strict guidelines as to who qualifies would cut down on the Fraud that costs billions of dollars a year. Plus you get the benefit of forcing fraudulent claimers to go back to work which in turn increases the Revenues . \n \n That's a start.",

   "The Program was Designed as a \" Pay-as-you-Go\" plan, and would in theory pay for itself under the right circumstances.\nThose circumstances being people don't live longer and more and more people pay in each year. These are not realistic which is why we constantly have to change SS to make it solvent. If we were honest about the whole thing we'd just increase taxes and just make it a true \"pay as you go\" plan where you literally just budget what it is that year and appropriate that. \n \n \nIt won't pay for itself when the ammount of Revenues coming in is lower than the ammount of benefits to be paid, which is where we are now.\nAnd projected to be from here on out.\n \n \nThe Surplus was set up to Pay Social Security benefits in times when the Revenues were short.

I highlighted the key points. They issue securities. Now, do you think the problem is they spent the money they got from issuing debt? What else do you do with proceeds from debt? You wouldn't issue it if you weren't planning on spending it. \n \n This is neither here nor there because the money is gone. You probably should understand that concept though. \n \n \n If they didn't borrow and spend the surplus that would be debt that would not have to be paid back. \nYes, it would still have to be paid back. You're suggesting they issue debt so they can put the money in a pile and look at it. This is fine but they still pay interest on that debt so it's not like that helps much. Why not just tax more and make it true pay-go. Furthermore, it's a moot point. The money is GONE. \n \n \nThey use the Social Security as a Bank and run it dry, and then when it's time to face the consequence they blame the program for their budget shortfall.\n As they should. The program is designed to fail. If you're a banker and you go out and find a bank robber and give him the banks money perhaps YOU are partly responsible. That's kind how this is. \n \n \nCurrently with Unemployment so high the revenues coming in are not enough to continue to pay the benefits, and with the surplus gone the Government is having to Borrow more and increase out debt in order to meet their obligations. That is not the Programs fault, the Program has worked and will work if it was managed correctly.\nNo, because the program is not projected to run surpluses anymore. This means you either change payouts or raise the tax (aka change the program because it doesn't work). Either way, this is a big change for people. This is how we kept it solvent since the last change in the early 90s. \n \n \nI agree Locking it away to sit and do nothing is not such a great Idea, but if that's what it would take to keep the government from raping the surplus and then blaming the program for the debt then I say Lock it away.\nLocking it away to sit and do nothing is exactly what you are advocating. If you are forced to invest in treasuries you either issue treasuries for NO reason and let the money sit in a warehouse somewhere (I know it would be in a bank...just a joke) OR you let Congress spend the proceeds of the issued debt which is what you always do when issuing debt (otherwise why would you issue it). \n \n \n They could place the surplus into an interest bearing account and still use this money to invest while the surplus grows from the interest.\nYou mean invest the money in outside markets? Weren't you JUST railing on the republicans for wanting to do this? \n \n \n I don't have a problem when they borrow Money from Social security to pay other bills, I have a problem when they whine about paying it back and then try to blame the program when the money runs out. yeah it's a huge, Huge part of the government Debt, but it's only so because the Government made it a problem.\nWell, there's no choice but to fix it now. So in short it IS the problem (along with other mandatory spending). Glad we settled this little debate. The fix is obviously to change benefits or raise the already ridiculously high tax rate. Not many other options. This is exactly what the deficit commission people recommended by the way.\n \n \nOk, Well short of Putting the surplus away like Above there are some things they could do NOW to help get the debt under control... I'll start with this...\n \n The current FICA rate is 7.65% (6.2% for social security tax and 1.45% for medicare tax) for employers\n and 5.65% (4.2% for social security tax and 1.45% for medicare tax) for employees. \n The wage limit for 2011 for social security is $106,500.00 (maximum withholding is $4,485.60). \n There is no wage limit for medicare.\n \n This was one of Obamas brain farts.. Lowering the Employee FICA rate by 2% . Now the Government is making up that 2% by borrowing or using Income Tax revenues to make up the difference.\nTo call this a brain fart is an understatement. Honestly, you shouldn't vote for him JUST for doing that. I can imagine the conversation went like this:\n \n Repubs: We need to cut the deficit\n Obama: Alright but what's causing this deficit?\n Repubs: Entitlements! They HAVE to be reformed.\n Obama: Ok, how should we do that\n Repubs: Keep the Bush tax cuts\n Obama: No, we need to only keep the ones for the middle class\n Repubs: No\n Obama: You drive a hard bargain. Fine, we'll keep the Bush tax and cut the entitlement taxes because we're supposed to fix those.\n Repubs: Umm, we never asked for that but ok, deal!\n Obama: Yes! I look awesome now.\n American Public: *sigh*\n \n \nI would start by Going back to the same level as it's been since the 90's 7.65% for both employee and Employer. Depending on what is done about Medicare , for instance if they eliminate it all together, then that 1.45 % going to medicare now can be rolled into Social Security.

Sure there's going to be some angry 69 year olds but oh well we got bills to pay. \nI don't think conservatives who know what they are talking about are against these. In fact, I've proposed those on these forums many times. There is literally no other way. \n \n The only bad one is the tax increase. It's ridiculously high for middle class taxpayers and borderline regressive in nature.",

   "You realize the second is REQUIRED BY LAW. This is how the program was set up. It's literally required by law to loan the money by issuing treasuries to SS Trust Fund.\n\n \n Yes I know it's required by Law, but nothing in the Law says that the Government HAS to spend that Money. We reformed Social Security back in 1983 to prepare for the baby boomers , and part of that reform was\n a: A gradual reduction in benefits\n b: A gradual increase in the retirement age from 65 to 67\n and C: A substantial boost in Payroll taxes. \n \n In 2009 we had a surplus of 2.5 TRILLION dollars and if left alone would have increased to about 3.8 TRILLION by 2020. The Government used that Money to Pay for The Bush Tax Cuts, Two Wars, Bailing out the Banks, among other things, and now the Government doesn't have the Money to Repay the Money so they want to Make drastic Cuts to the Program . You have to think of Social Security as it's own Entity, and not a Part of Our Government. That Surplus Money did NOT belong to the Government, it was a Loan that Has to be Paid under the Law. Obama didn't help matters by reducing the FICA tax , in fact he made things so much worse now they are basically forced to cut the program in order to save it. But there are ways to fix this without making any cuts ... The Government is just unwilling or too ignorant to do it.\n \n \n\n Which you just admitted we need. It's rather a moot point to argue about who's fault it is. We're here now and SS isn't projected to have any surpluses for the next 70 years.\n\n \n You're right, it doesn't matter who's fault it is , the Money has been spent. There is no more Surplus to borrow from so that they can pay back what is owed. That 2.5 trillion dollar surplus belonged to the People who paid it into the program, so asking them to pay it again by placing the burden on the people is wrong no matter how you look at it. \n \n \n\n Ya think? Our entire government has a budget crisis because of over spending and reckless behavior. That's neither here nor there. The ENTIRE point of this was to show you that Medicare and SS are the main areas that caused this. The government recklessly promised more than they can deliver. \n\n \n Ok so the Government promised more than they can deliver, How is that Social Security and Medicares Fault? These Programs are run by the Government but they are not Part of the Government. Social Security the way it is structured now has worked and would have worked had the GOVERNMENT not been reckless in their borrowing and spending. It's NOT Social security's fault, That's what I've said all along, Don't blame the Program blame the ones who ran it into the ground.\n \n \n\n No, my idea was to literally just have it be a General Fund appropriation as if it were the Department of Transportation. While this is STILL a bad idea it is 1000 times better than the current structure of SS. By the way, Social Security was set up this way to avoid being ruled unconstitutional (which it still is). So there was a method to the madness.\n\n \n The Constitutionality of Social Security is still up to debate, The Supreme Court Ruled 5-4 in favor of Social Security way back in 1937 so as far as the Law is concerned it is Constitutional. Whether the Courts had the Power to make such a ruling granting power to the Government is another debate. I personally don't think it matters now, the Program has worked for years and the Government has used the Program as a piggy bank so I doubt they will eliminate it all together. \n \n Although I do think some changes need to be made I don't think the basic structure should be changed. If anything they need to do the things described before and add some more strict guidelines as to How the Government uses any Surplus. The Program is meant to be funded by Taxes, and cutting those taxes , especially during a recession , is what hurts the most. If the People who will eventually depend on Social Security in retirement are unwilling to Fund the program then maybe it is time to do something different. I for one would never agree to Privatizing , that would never work and I think the GOP knows it.",

The SS Trust fund? \n \n I still don't think you get how that works. There was no 2.5 Trillion surplus in 2009. That money was already used to purchase treasuries and it was spent by the federal government over the last 30 years. Every dime of the SS money that comes in is spent each year. \n \n \nYou have to think of Social Security as it's own Entity, and not a Part of Our Government.

These Programs are run by the Government but they are not Part of the Government.\nThey are part of the government and they are structured by law. They were structured in a way that would naturally go bankrupt at some point. You think a company would get away with having employees (and employer) contribute to a pension plan where they took the money and paid the people currently receiving benefits and then the company \"borrowed\" the rest of it to pay salaries would be able to run for a long time? The answer is no. In any other word of accounting this would be a multi-trillion dollar liability on the financials. It is an obligation OWED. Social Security and later Medicare were set up to operate this way. Did the law require the government to spend the proceeds on treasuries? No, but that's naturally what you do because you wouldn't issue treasuries without needing the money. Like I said earlier, it was structured this way to avoid Supreme Court complications. It's total BS and should be changed. It's just not smart to have all your eggs in one basket like that.\n \n \nThe Constitutionality of Social Security is still up to debate, The Supreme Court Ruled 5-4 in favor of Social Security way back in 1937 so as far as the Law is concerned it is Constitutional. Whether the Courts had the Power to make such a ruling granting power to the Government is another debate. I personally don't think it matters now, the Program has worked for years and the Government has used the Program as a piggy bank so I doubt they will eliminate it all together. \nI personally like the idea of a forced retirement account (like Australia) but if you read that opinion you clearly see it is total BS and probably is unconstitutional. I mean really, congress has the power to promote \"general welfare\" and therefore its good? That negate basically the entire constitution. \n \n \nAlthough I do think some changes need to be made I don't think the basic structure should be changed. If anything they need to do the things described before and add some more strict guidelines as to How the Government uses any Surplus.\nIt's not a surplus. That's the term that gets you in trouble. It should be run one of two ways....run like a traditional government pension programs (see VRS for Virginia which invests in outside things) but without the years of service thing OR it should be just a welfare program funded by general revenues. I suppose you could do some combination of the two but the problem IS the structure in that they purchase only treasuries. \n \n \nI for one would never agree to Privatizing , that would never work and I think the GOP knows it.\nyet you suggested it in another post. Privatizing is mainly describing using the money to purchase outside investments. I don't think many people simply want to force you to use various outside investment companies. This obviously wouldn't work.\n \n My ideal SS plan would be as follows:[*]You are required to invest 6-8% of income to SS[*]No employer involvement[*]This 8% would be invested by SS as they see fit and includes a diverse investment portfolio.[*]It would have to be funded at 80+% or an automatic investment increase would happen to get it there. [*]Payments out would be based upon some formula that would benefit the poor, disabled. So less benefits would be [*]You can choose to invest an additional 5-8% of your income[*]This optional investment would give you the option of how you wanted to invest and 100% of this money would go towards your retirement[*]This could be withdrawn with no penalty after the age of 62 (or something)[*]could be withdrawn sooner with penalty\n \n There would be more to it but that's the basic idea. It still forces a retirement plan and still is a somewhat welfare program. It also eliminates the requirement to invest solely in treasuries. \n \n There are downsides though...mostly that you are investing in the stock market which is total XXXX.",

This is what is refered to as the Surplus, the ammount of treasury bonds accumulated by the government borrowing which is indeed required by Law. When Social security Revenues are lower than expected payout then the trust fund trustees cash in these bonds to issue payments of benefits.

That money doesn't just belong to the government, it was money paid in by workers and the government is responsible to pay it back. They can't borrow more from Social security because we are no longer running a surplus, so they are forced to borrow from other means because the Treasuries must be paid back in order to issue payments. \n The Government borrows this Money by Law, but nothing says how they have to spend it. This is that part that Clinton wanted to \"lock\" away , the Surplus Money that the Government is forced to buy from social security in the form of Secured treasury bonds.

Decreased Revenues is what started Social security on this decline. \n If any change should be made to the structure they should drop the Requirement to invest in only treasury bonds and allow them to invest any surplus in other areas. the downside like you said is that the Stock market kind of blows.

He did, in fact, just use the revenue from issuing treasuries to SS as part of the way to balance. He was right in that really we should have just assumed it was treasuries we should not have issued and given the money \"back\" to SS Trust fund (aka lockbox). \n \n On financial reporting the tax is shown as just combined revenue (Individual income tax and tax withholdings) and expenditures as part of the whole (Social Security Admin). http://gao.gov/financial/fy2010/10stmt.pdf\n \n Also, here in the great state of Virginia it is illegal to use bond proceeds to funding general obligations.

You just wiped out tax costs. Employers can produce less and make the same profit. There will still be more jobs than employees and there seems to be no incentive to fulfill those jobs since the employer determines the wage.

Business has learned how to manipulate the customer far better than vendors of 100 years ago.\n \n \nprofits are driven to $0 through competition. All the advantage goes to the customer\n\n \n Really? Gas and groceries are two highly competitive markets that work on thin margins. Prices go up and down daily, but overall they always rise. At best competition can stabilize price, it may start a short term bidding war like what you see with cell phones every so often. But once they increase their customer base and the dust settles price starts to rise again.\n \n Non-profits are the only ones who take it to 0. Well intentional loss for tax purposes and bankruptcy also but your not ready for those yet.\n \n \n \nanyone can brand but only one can have the best product in the world. American cars have brands. GOt it now????/\n\n \n Being the best has value but with branding number 50 can make people think they are number one. Perception is reality and if you control perception guess what else you control?\n \n \n \nwhat honor system?????\n\n \n You seem to feel people will do right by each other most of the time. That people will not hurt their best interest to hurt another. Economist Zizzo and Oswald did a study finding that 62% of the time people will act against their best interest if by doing so someone else's interest will also be reduced. \n \n \n \nbusiness took us from the stone age to here while regulation in the USSR and Red China starved 100 million death. That is saintly\n\n \n Government policy starved people everywhere. Capitilism provides the best oppurtunity for personal success, it does not insure it and it has a number potential pitfalls.\n \n \nno no no if you build the best in the world at the lowest price they will come \n\n \n Why if I build the 10th best spend a little on good advertising I can earn close to the best with better margins even though I sell less. \n \n \n \nOECD says we have the most capitalism and the highest standard of living in human history among big industrialized countries. Imagine where we'd be without liberal interference. Did you noticed what happend when China deregulated, 20 millin who would have slowly starved under liberal regulation bought cars instead. Look at health care the most regulated and the most costly.\n \n \n Compare what the 1st world countries looked like during laissaz-faire capitalism and then under moderately regulated and with worker protections in place. The overall health and wealth was superior. \n \n Health care costs are not high because of regulations. \n \n I don't know about you but I have a problem watching a commercial for a new drug whose side effects include suicidal tendencies, anal leakage, organ failure and death. I find this disturbing knowing that pharmaceutical companies will leave a product on the market knowing IT WILL CAUSE HARM.\n \n \n \nconservatives and libertarian always said interference through Fanny Freddie CRA etc etc or USSR or Cuban interference would cause huge problems.\n\n \n Politicians in general are unqualified for the position they hold and long ago the forgot the meaning of representative government. Liberal or Conservative is no guarantee of competency or desire to look out for the interest of the population that put them in office.\n \n Your unwillingness to judge and hold accountable those who do poorly, instead diverting attention to the wrong areas only makes the problems worse. You become a drain on resources while hindering those looking to create solutions. You are one of those 62%.",

   "mostly trivial and with huge administrative burdens and each would be a big fight to impliment. \n \n You need to come up with a philosophy not Nazi liberal over lord who decides who contributes and doles out rewards. USSR failed because of Liberal overlords. Why not try freedom here?\n\n \n First I did respond to your earlier post \n \n Second this was your plan\n \n \nThe Republican way to fix the economy\n 1) eliminate all business taxes since they are passed on to consumers, but nevertheless distract business a lot. The GE tax return takes 1000 people to prepare, for example.\n \n 2) eliminate unions since they drive jobs off shore with higher wages\n \n 3) eliminate minimum wage laws\n \n 4) ship illegal workers home to instantly create 10 million jobs and upward pressure on wages\n \n 5) cut health care costs in half and increase quality by making health care competitive capitalist.\n \n 6) make inflation illegal so businesses and people can make economic plans and not waste time energy and money on things like gold and silver.\n \n 7) make Social Security private so 15% of American's pay will be put into savings, and then investments, rather than wasted on current consumption as it is now.\n \n 8) make all able bodied Americans work by making some entitlements such as food stamps, and unemployment private so people are consuming their own savings\n \n 9) make accounting transparent so all can see inside any business and compare it to any other business. This one is important but will be way over the liberals head.\n \n 10) make the costs and profits of all financial transactions crystal clear and comparable\n \n 11) ??\n\n \n Call me silly but I fail to see anything philosophical in the above. What I do see is broad generalizations with little thought behind them. \n \n Do you suppose your ideas would be implemented with ease? Assume there are not enough liberals to keep it from being enacted so you only have to convince conservatives these are good ideas.\n \n I must have done well if all you can grumble about is it wouldn't pass, administrative costs and changing what it is you wanted. Hardly worthy objections.",
