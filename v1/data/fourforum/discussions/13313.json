You can make that argument, but only if you are prepared to propose that there be no government at all, as the anarchists do. All the waffling about taxation is theft does in the healthcare argument is repeat \"I don't like public healthcare\" in different words, even by your explanation it is not saying anything factual about the tax system, only that the author does not like that particular item of spending. It doesn't support their argument in any way.",

If he appropriated billions of dollars to fund better healthcare to people that you believe should be left to pay for their own healthcare then you may believe that he has stolen that money, especially if it means a hike in the money that you pay in taxes.",

Immoral, but that's a different discussion. The reason we have representative governments elected by the people is to ensure that, while governments have the right to levy and spend money, we have the right to elect someone else if we disagree with how much they're levying and what they're spending it on. Saying that you don't think the government should be spending money on something doesn't advance the argument over whether they should or not any further, except in so far as your vote is one of millions which will decide who forms the next government.
