   "Nice post Nwarth. :)\n \n As far as I understand it Buddhist do believe 'gods' exist though but in the sense of Hindu aspect-gods. They don't worship these gods (more like 'divine beings') and believe they are inferior to humans because only humans can achieve enlightenment. As such they believe you can be reincarnated as a god but you'd be better off being incarnated as a human...\n \n Indeed I remeber reading somewhere that Buddhists believe two hindu gods converted to Buddhism and now 'protect' some holy Buddhist scripture in one of the other many planes of existance.\nWhether you're better of as a human is unclear, but it does seem to be likely that you've got more chance of enlightenment as the life of the gods is very pleasant so there isn't the same impteus to escape suffering. They also have 'Boddhisatvas' in certain Mahayana traditions who are enlightened or near-enlightened beings that help people much like minor gods, or perhaps closer to Catholic saints. Emphasis is placed on the fact they started the process as normal humans.\n \n Even the earliest Therevada scriptures refer to Hindu gods, but they are closer to humans than to Christian gods. There are some Buddhist scriptures which actually mock Brahma, the creator god, slightly, where he can't answer questions of a monk and pretends to be all ineffable in front of the other gods\n before talking to the monk in private and saying 'stop showing me up, I don't know. Go ask the Buddha, he'll tell you'",

   "Interesting, although is it not true Hindus admit that their aspect-gods (including Brahma) don't know who or what created 'creation' -- they don't try to hide this fact I mean?\n \n In the regards to being better of as a human rather than a god I was reffering to the ability to reach enlightenment -- certainly I doubt there's many things other than that which would make existance as a human preferable to that of a god.",

   "I'm not exactly an expert on this, but Brahma is prtrayed as the creator god. On the other hand he is part of Brahman, the world-spirit which encompasses all existence.\n \n The problem with understanding this stuff is the label 'Hindu' is a Muslim term that was adopted by Hindus becasue of the need to resist Isalm. It's not one belief structure, and incorperates believers in everything being phsyically/metaphysically casued and inevitable, and supporters of free will, theists andd atheists, believers in at least three deities as the overriding deity, devotional belief and intellectual belief, sacrifice-led, morality-led and asceticism-led as well as combinatons. (I recently studied the Bhagavad-Gita which treats everything as an inevitable cycle in some ways but retains an idea of responisbility, talks of abstract \\'Brahma\\' but treats Krishna/Vishnu as everything and conflates sacrifice, asceticism and action into a single thing, which is essentially devoting every action to fulfilling duty with no selfish considerations that bind to the physical.\n \n Another example is that early Hindus, like early Jews, seem to have had little idea of an afterlife, and some early forms were closer to heaven than reincarnation.\n \n As for the reaching enlightenment bonus for humans, this is true. Buddhism is a more active and prosleytising religion than Hinduism - it\\'s idea of liberation is almost as urgent as the idea of salvation in Christianity, despite reincarnation. This is because great emphasis is placed upon the fact that birth as a human is a huge karmic achievement and must not be squandered.",
