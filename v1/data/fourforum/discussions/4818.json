I remember the year that Bob Hope started drawing social security (it was on a tv program) and thinking, \"he is a millionaire, he doesn't need social security\". There have been plenty of people who really shouldn't have drawn the money--they didn't need it. In as much as, the disable worker who, still works for cash money and draws his/her pension.\n \n Some of you don't stop to think, the common laborer doesn't really make enough money to set up a decent IRA to retire on. That is what social security was set up for, the lower income laborer who had no benefits to retire on. All people are not employed by companies who pay enough to do well on retirement without social security. I worked in a hospital for 20 years and yes we had a retirement plan.......you know how much was in it--when they froze it and it didn't draw any more interest....two thousand dollars and I was making ten dollars an hour for the previous few years before I quit. Wow, that would really take the place of social security. Now, I am at the brink of being the age that will not receive social security. Had I known, I could have saved that two grand to retire on! (I am being sarcastic)\n \n \n People who live in rural areas are not as protected from the threat of no social security to buy their arthritis medicine on as people who have lived with and worked for corporate monsters with sizeable retirements, IRA, or whatever.\n \n I hope any of you who are for cutting social security off in a heart beat, don't draw any money from it....or, you can donate it to feeding and housing to the people who are not so well off monetarily.
