I think it is most needed in the rural areas of the U.S. as these areas or the main areas of oppostition to any form or gay rights.\n\n \n I think alot of the Bible is vague and open to interpretation. If you want to support a position, almost any position, you can find a passage somewhere in the Bible to support it. Which means that doing so doesn't actually support your position much at all. It's pretty clear that the OT and Paul are both against homosexuality, so for every line that maybe-kinda supports homosexuality there will be several that outright denounce it. I don't see this as a winning tactic.",

   "But were the condemnations against committed gay couples? or against male prostitution? That is the question.\n\n \n No, that's your question, because you support gay rights. If you don't support gay rights you'll just read it at face value. If you don't want to support gay rights, if you want to find justification in the Bible for your position, then your question will be dismissed out of hand. I simply don't see anyone saying \"Hmm, I never thought that that might be what was meant. Maybe I'll rethink my position on gays.\"\n \n Part of the reason I don't think it would work is that I doubt many people actually dislike gays because the Bible tells them to. The Bible says lots of stuff that people like that are quite comfortable ignoring. I think they start disliking gays, and just use the Bible to help justify those feelings. Given that, there's no way you're going to shift their interpretation. They need for the Bible to condemn gays to justify their condemnation of gays.",

I think that people can and do change their thinking about gay people all the time, as they get to know gay people, and the prejudice they have been taught all their lives is challenged and they reconsider that prejudice. \n \n But there is another issue for many devout Christians, I think, and that is, \"Can I continue to be a Christian and believe in the truth of the Bible and embrace and accept gay people for who they are?\" Many people may fear that if they retreat from previously held beliefs about gay people, they are stuck throwing out the whole Bible and throwing out their faith. I think that Christians who are gay or gay-affirming can make a difference here by showing folks how they can embrace and accept gay people and still be strong, committed Christians who believe in the Bible. It's all in how you interpret the Bible. \n \n This is why I think the Soulforce Equality Rides are so important. Young Christians who support equality and inclusion of gay people in the churches are riding on buses around the country to colleges and universities, mostly Christian, that clearly oppose gay equality and have an anti-gay policy. They are talking to students at these colleges and bringing them a message that they can embrace and accept gay people without losing their Christian faith or commitment. It's quite inspiring to read about the journey of the Soulforce Equality Riders. Here is a link to the Equality Rides website: \n \n http://www.equalityride.com",

Honestly, I myself, put no more credibility in the Bible's teachings then a Dr. Suess book. \n However, most of my family, especially my Mother, is deeply religious and I see this as hope that they may be able to see homosexuality in a different light. I wish the opinion of the religious didn't effect me or you or anyone but the reality is that they do. Very much so. I respect those that hold religion as sacred, that's their right.
