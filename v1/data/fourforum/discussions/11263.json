   "Little Brother, by Cory Doctorow.\n \n This unsettlingly believable story is set in the immediate future, where a terrorist attack sparks a wave of increased surveillance in the name of 'freedom'. I started reading it yesterday and couldn't look away until I'd finished reading. It's excellently written, and raises some very important issues on the grounds of civil liberties.\n \n Tell your friends.\n \n (The book is released for free under the Creative Commons License, simply go to the link above, choose your format, and get reading. Enjoy!)",
