   "I love this that the US has the worst health care. We don't have the worst we have the best. You don't see people flying in from all over the world to go to Canada, UK or Cuba for health care they don't. Where do they go? The US ,why the US is the leader in health care inovation. So what is the drawback to the US health care it's expensive. Do any of you know why?\n \n One of the main reasons US health care is so expencive is law suits. Don't beleave me! You liberals in the US the next time you go to your doctor ask them how much they pay annualy for malpractice insurance. The figure depending on what their practice is it will be in between $100,000.00 & $250,000.00 + a year and this is just for that doctor. Just imagine how much it costs to insure a hospital or a clinic. In one health care insurance office that I know of they went from 4 lawyers on retainer in the mid 80's to over 160 in 2004. Just magine how much this costs our health care system. And all these costs are reflected in your premiums.\n \n Well you think that the insurance is that high because we have crappy doctors wrong. The reason that it's that high is because of frivilus law suits. Why because lawyers know that if they bring a law suit against a doctor no matter how frivilus they will make money. You think no they won't they can't win the case so they don't get payed. Wrong, they don't have to win because they are planning to settle out of court. When a law suit is brought the insurance company weighs the costs of defending the case using the lawyers they have on retainer. For argument sake lets say a suit is brought for 10 million the lawyers look at the odds of winning the case. If it is a no contest for them they will next weigh how much it will cost to take the case to trial and win. Lets say that will cost 3 million the lawyers for the insurance company will offer the plantiff $750 thousand to get lost. The case settles and the plantiff and his lawyer just stole $750 thousand they each get $375 thousand and are happy. You and I who carry health care insurance just got screwed. It is cheaper for the insurance company to settle than to go to trial.\n \n You think that all these other nations have the same issue wrong. With govenment run health care you you can't Sue the government. What can be done? There are a number of congressmen who have been calling for Tort reform for decades in order to fight frivilous law suits. These suits don't just effect our health care system but everyone is effected by higher costs for everything because bussinesses have to have lawyers on retainer and that will be reflected in the cost of products you purchase.\n \n What can be done? Tort reform Go to the same system as in the UK. In the UK if you bring a frivilus lawsuit and lose you pay all of the winners court costs. With this system the insurers will fight the case instead of settle because it is to their advantage to fight and win. With that system frivilus lawsuits won't be brought because they won't be able to settle a case out of court, because the insurers will fight the case instead of settle.",

With the rest of the richest nations, except for ourselves, following closely behind.\n \n I think we have excellent doctors in the U.S., but our system is not allowing them to practice medicine as they should be able to.\n \n What you say about tort reform would seem to imply that doctors would concur with your position on health care and the U.K. Indeed, according to Dr. Quentin Young, coordinator for Physicians for a National Health Program [bold added], \n \n Support for single payer is extensive. In a peer-reviewed statistical study in the Annals of Internal Medicine, 59 percent of U.S. physicians said they would support government action to establish national health insurance.

It includes the following, with more details at the link:\n \n Expand and improve Medicare to cover all U.S. residents.\n \n Provide comprehensive medication coverage to all participants.\n \n Require no co-payments or deductibles.\n \n Cover all medically necessary services, including primary care, inpatient care, outpatient care, emergency care, prescription drugs, durable medical equipment, long-term care, mental health services, dentistry, eye care, chiropractic and other alternative care, and substance abuse treatment. \n \n Patients would have their choice of physicians, providers, hospitals, clinics and practices.\n \n Insurers would be able to provide benefits not provided by the plan, such as cosmetic surgery.\n \n Reimbursement rates for physicians and health care providers would be set annually; prescription drug prices would be negotiated.\n \n Ninety-five percent of families would pay less for health care than they do today.\n \n Opinion: Editorials & Letters | \"GUEST VIEWPOINT by Marc Shapiro: Single-payer system can cover more for less\" | The Register-Guard\n \n With massive bail-outs to crooks that don't deserve it, and health care on the table, now is the time for those 65% and counting of Americans to call their representatives and let them know they want single payer as part of the dialogue, at present, in Congress.",

   "Can do :)\n \n A recent one relates to Cornell billing for work not done: That's Outrageous -- Research Grant Fraud | Michael Crowley | Reader's Digest\n This was settled for 2.6 million.\n \n Of course you have the famous United States ex rel. Eastmond v. Vortec Corp case\n \n Here are two more cases that I quickly found on google: 2 Universities to Pay U.S. $1.6 Million in Research Fraud Case - The New York Times)\n \n Most fraud is fairly small and wouldn't make the paper (like a professor falsifying research time cards to get paid more by the grant). \n \n R&D is audited at universities. These are not intended to prevent all fraud...they look at internal controls and risk.\n\n Thanks for these links, Steeeve.\n \n Hopefully, now that it's ok to be a scientist, scientists will be more at liberty to vet their fellow scientists and critique their work before it is approved and funded.\n \n This is the way it was done in the old days before George W. Bush declared science verboten. This vetting didn't weed out all the frauds initially but they were eventually caught out by their fellow scientists who tried to use their methods and discovered that they were fraudulent.",

   "I think you missed my point. I'm not arguing that doctors will live in poverty (and I assumed there were \"custodial engineers\" in this country that made high salaries, which is why I inserted the word average).\n \n My point is there is nothing wrong with profit as an incentive.\n \n Also, it's my understanding that doctors in England who have private practices make more money than doctors who participate in socialized practices.\n\n \n Well, we all need a means for living, including doctors. But I think profit, as a concept, is misleading in the health care debate. It's the factor that needs to be taken out of the equation in the U.S. as far as needed medicine is concerned. If someone wants to make millions giving movie stars face lifts, go ahead, but that's not really practicing medicine, anyway, IMO.

   "I see what many of you are trying to say, national healthcare is when the government supplies us with rationed healthcare, but the single payer system is the exact opposite. The public runs healthcare. Now I can see what the benefits are but the way to go is health insurance companies for several reasons.\n \n Now correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that there are many healthcare companies because the whole United States would not just buy from one company. It is easier to run a healthcare company that deals with only a part of the population of the U.S rather than the whole population. National Healthcare is just the government removing all those companies and acting as one giant healthcare company. Now since premiums will skyrocket, people will struggle to pay for them and lose their healthcare eventually ending up on a government run health plan, putting the insurance companies out of business.:xbanghead \n \n With this giant healthcare company called the Fed, everyone will have to wait months for care. It is much harder to run a gigantic country with over 300 million people with one company or government, then for a bunch of other companies to handle parts of the population. Delays to vital tests, MRI's, CAT scans, etc. Everyone deserves healthcare I agree but there are other ways to go about it. Having one giant company run the whole thing is a massive mistake.\n \n Finally, unemployment will soar. National Healthcare is paid for on small businesses and they cannot afford the huge costs without laying off workers contributing to unemployment. Then we will just have corporations to buy from who just focuses on large groups of people. All of these systems have their flaws, but this one is the most effective with the least cost.\n \n If you disagree with any of these I would be happy to listen.\n \n -44j",
