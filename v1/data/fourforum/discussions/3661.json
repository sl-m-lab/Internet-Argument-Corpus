   "...messing with US politics. Apparently, this attempt backfired. You really should read the whole article to get the picture. I've posted the beginning and the end below the link.\n \n http://slate.msn.com/id/2109217/\n \n Imagine being an undecided voter in Clark County, Ohio, last month. You kind of think John Kerry has some good points about the war in Iraq and the economy, but you feel more comfortable with George Bush's faith and his resolve. One day, you open your mailbox to find a letter from someone in England you've never met. It starts like this:\n \n Don't be so ashamed of your president: the majority of you didn't vote for him. If Bush is finally elected properly, that will be the time for Americans travelling abroad to simulate a Canadian accent. Please don't let it come to that. Vote against Bin Laden's dream candidate. Vote to send Bush packing.\n \n It's signed Richard Dawkins, a professor of the public understanding of science at Oxford University. And you're thinking, ashamed of Bush? Canadian accent? Who is this pretentious Brit and why is he writing to me?\n \n ...\n \n \n The most significant stat here is how Clark County compares to the other 15 Ohio counties won by Gore in 2000. Kerry won every Gore county in Ohio except Clark.  He even increased Gore's winning margin in 12 of the 16. Nowhere among the Gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in Clark. The Guardian's Katz was quoted as saying it would be \"self-aggrandizing\" to claim Operation Clark County affected the election. Don't be so modest, Ian.",

   "Ah! This is all poo.\n \n Look at this clip from a letter supposedly written by an American:\n \n \nConsider this: stay out of American electoral politics. Unless you would like a company of US Navy Seals-Republican to a man-to descend upon the offices of the Guardian, bag the lot of you, and transport you to Guantanamo Bay, where you can share quarters with some lonely Taliban shepherd boys.\n\n \n Ok, no american west of New Hampshire, and not even there, would ever use the phrase \"bag the lot of you\" unless he were making fun of brits. If the letter ended in \"all me mates met in the loo and decided John Kerry was tuppence short of a shilling\" it's a cinch it was written somewhere \"over there.\"\n \n Anyway.........",
