   "In some ways many of the interpretation of evolutionary truths are couched in philosophical terms. If you believe in naturalism, or materialism, your view of evolution is most likely naturalistic, or materialistic.\n \n Recently I've become aware of a cult that is passing itself off as science; Objectivism. Akin to scientism, it makes a claim about truths, and these colour its followers ideas of evolutionary theory.\n \n \"The cultic flaw in Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism is not in the use of reason, or in the emphasis on individuality, or in the belief that humans are self motivated, or in the conviction that capitalism is the ideal system. The fallacy in Objectivism is the belief that absolute knowledge and final Truths are attainable through reason, and therefore there can be absolute right and wrong knowledge, and absolute moral and immoral thought and action. For Objectivists, once a principle has been discovered through reason to be True, that is the end of the discussion. If you disagree with the principle, then your reasoning is flawed. If your reasoning is flawed it can be corrected, but if it is not, you remain flawed and do not belong in the group.\n THE UNLIKELIEST CULT IN HISTORY\n BY MICHAEL SHERMER\n http://www.skeptic.com/02.2.shermer-unlikely-cult.html\n \n In the limited interaction I've had with the member of this pseudo-scientific cult I've discovered that not only do they not put their views of science to the test of science, but they shy away from scientific evidence. In short, I find their views irrational.\n \n Their views aren't scientific\n \"Scientism, in the strong sense, is the self-annihilating view that only scientific claims are meaningful, which is not a scientific claim and hence, if true, not meaningful.\"\n \n http://skepdic.com/scientism.html\n \n \n \n There views are irrational, but given a gloss of rationality.\n \n \"Usually, \"rationality\" is a Humpty-Dumpty word, that means whatever the user finds is convenient to club his opponents with.\"\n \n http://world.std.com/~mhuben/skept/rationality.html\n \n \n \n And this is why they can be so abusive towards any who don't hold to what they already conclude to be unquestionable truths...\n \n \"Why do so many Objectivists insist on attacking the honesty, integrity, and character of their opponents? Are such attacks an aberration, or is this sort of behavior actually advocated by Objectivism?\"\n \n http://www.jeffcomp.com/faq/wrong.html\n \n \n \n Any view of evolutionary theory, and development of evolutionary theory will be ham-strung by the circular reasoning of cult members.",

It's hopelessly absurd.\n -Mac\n\n There you go again mixing up the two. For shame Mach, but then again arguing against something stated would be too difficult.\n \n You know of the unknowable; you give a definition. Unknowable must be what we don't know. Does that mean we don't know of the unknowable? Actually you ignore that question, because it doesn't suit your rant.\n \n I like your appeal to authority ... \"Father of logic\", nice touch. :). The odd thing here of course is that you again rest your argument about science in philosophy, a particular stream of philosophy.\n There are differing views...\n \" Others have defined substance as material (Hobbes) or mental (Lotze), as static (Parmenides) or dynamic (Heraclitus), as knowable (Aristotle) or unknowable (Hume). Kant argued that our cognitive faculties require that we conceive of the world as containing substance, i.e., something that remains constant in the face of continuous change.\"\n http://www.bartleby.com/65/su/substanc.html\n That is just about substance, but what does Aristotle actually say about the unknowable?\n In his book \"Physics\"...\n \"Now (1) the infinite qua infinite is unknowable, so that what is infinite in multitude or size is unknowable in quantity, and what is infinite in variety of kind is unknowable in quality. But the principles in question are infinite both in multitude and in kind. Therefore it is impossible to know things which are composed of them; for it is when we know the nature and quantity of its components that we suppose we know a complex.\"\n http://people.bu.edu/wwildman/WeirdWildWeb/courses/wphil/readings/wphil_rdg07_physics_entire.htm\n also at\n http://www.non-contradiction.com/ac_works_b7.asp\n and\n http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.1.i.html\n Mmmm..... seems he can make a statement about what is unknowable. Does this mean he believes that the infinite, in the capacity of being infinite does not exist? Or, is he saying that the infinite is unknowable? There is a difference, can you spot it?\n \n How can he even discuss what the unknowable is, if it doesn't exist, and if you can't know anything about it? How do you know something about something that is beyond knowing?\n What does Aristotle mean?\n \"Matter, for Aristotle, is unknowable in itself because it has no properties for the mind to grasp, it is indefinite.\"\n Cf. Physica 207a 25\n http://www.examinedlifejournal.com/archives/vol2ed7/actandpotency2.shtml\n \n In fact what he is saying is that all substance (material) can be known, but all non-substance can not. Note also he doesn't disagree with non-material. Not only that, he deemed evolution impossible. Go 'father of logic, Go! :)\n \"Plato and Aristotle, who governed biology until 1859. The world was eternal, species were fixed from all eternity, and the idea of evolution was inconceivable. Aristotle said that non-material agencies operate in nature and Plato said that eternal ideas generate earthly varieties\"\n http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/Education/Aulie7-03.html\n \n It is in fact a western trait to search into the unknowable, coming under the term Scholasticism, and not an Orthodox tradition. We believe that God is, in his essence \n unknowable, and we make no concerted attempt to define him.\n \n It is in fact this search for God that produced western science. The idea being that to understand the world, would lead to an understanding of God... which is why materialism rose in Christian thought...as opposed to Aristotle.\n \"In 17th century England the chemist Robert Boyle, of Boyle's Law fame, vigorously opposed Aristotle. A pious Christian, he believed that divine purpose invested nature, but that Aristotelian purpose was not efficacious in science. For Boyle, creation meant that scientific explanation lay in the material connections in nature, without any Aristotelian non-material agencies\"\n http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/Education/Aulie7-03.html\n \n In summary. Aristotle does say that contradictions can't exist. A tick for Mach.\n Aristotle however believes in\n non-material causes\n unknowables\n and is against evolution.\n \n Mach and the objectivist stance he takes simply has to ignore all that (again he is selective in 'evidence') and try to apply one part of what Aristotle says, to an argument. All he's done is include it in his argument. No connection is made. Simply stating it is not argument.\n \n While I'm talking about Objectivism, and seeing as Mach agrees that this will make it 'on-topic' :)\n What's something else interesting about Objectivism?\n \"\"Rape is an integral and necessary expression of human nature. Sexual assaults have been present in every society since the dawn of time. It is the drive of man to reproduce, to compete successfully for advantage on the battlefield of life and evolution.\"\n http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1230539&lastnode_id=162913",
