   "Rules of firearm saftey:\n \n 1) All firearms are considered to be loaded. There is no such thing as a empty firearm.\n \n 2) Never ever point the firearm at something you are willing to kill or destroy. (See rule 1)\n \n 3) Never put your finger on the trigger until you aim it and are ready to pull the trigger. (See rule 1 and 2)\n \n 4) Verify your target. Make sure you want to hit it and what is behind it. (Check rule 2)\n \n \n \n There are more rules, but they all come these basic 4 rules. These rules were not 100% safe rules. See rule 4. You can do everything right and still kill someone innocent behind your target. What they highlight is that YOU holding the firearm is the responsible authority for any consequences when the bullet leaves the barrel. It is the person holding the firearm and pulling the trigger, is the person that will be crucified or praised, depending on the outcome of the bullet leaving the barrel.",
