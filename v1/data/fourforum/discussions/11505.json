   "Arizona Sen. John McCain has announced that he opposes \"net neutrality.\"\n \n McCain appeared at the All Things Digital conference in Carlsbad, Calif., and said he did not think government regulation of internet service providers to stop them from censoring, slowing down, or otherwise disrupting consumer's access to the internet in order to stifle competitors or undesirable content was an appropriate solution.\n\n \n http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2007/6/3/224720.shtml\n \n A good reason not to vote for McCain.\n \n Why you ask? McCain does have a good point in that ISPs should be able to profit from their service, but US rates compared to their bandwidth are absolutely terrible compared to European and Asian cost per mb. Americans pay far more for their high speed internet (and even their dial up) then virtually everyone else in the developed world. South Korea has packages of 10+ mb/s for an equivalent $20 a month. That's unheard of in America. \n \n Secondly, the sheer amount of productivity and innovation coming out of American homes through broadband is an excellent reason not to created a tiered system that the death of Net Neutrality would create. There's a 18 year old who made a million dollars off of her home internet business creating myspace accessories. Why would we want to cut down on innovation and entrepreneurship like that? \n \n We already we have a tiered system. The more you pay, the faster your connection. The ISP complain about massive loads is such a giant load of ####. If they spent a few million they could easily increase bandwidth by 256x through the user of spectrum splitters which would allow data to be sent on 256 different colored lights down a fiber optic light. But that would create a huge glut of bandwidth and the larger supply gets, the lower price gets and thus goes their bottom line. \n \n McCain is wrong on Net Neutrality and his stance on it is dangerous to America's economy. Especially in the globalized world where brain is far more important then brawn.",

   " by that logic, every action the government takes to interfere in the market is fascist\n\n \n To an extent, but this action is particularly fascist because it gives the government immense control over the last area where people can freely express themselves without its intervention.\n \n \nFurthermore, that's an obvious fallacy of slippery slope. \n\n \n That's not a fallacy, that's reality. If you think the government, once handed the power to regulate what ISPs display and what they don't and at what speed, will use that power purely for good, you're a naive XXXXX, or being deliberately obtuse.\n \n Every single time the government gets the power to control what you see or hear, it uses it to the greatest extent possible to manipulate and control you, every single time. You must be a complete idiot if you don't believe it won't do the exact same thing this time.\n \n \nAll NN does is prevent an even more tiered system\n\n \n And this vague ideological conception of how the internet should look in some kind of technophile dreamland justifies giving the government power over what you see and hear in the last remaining domain of free speech there is in America?\n \n \nSymbiote, can you explain to me what NN is?\n\n \n A politically correct buzzword for having the feds control the content ISPs display and the rate at which they display it.",

   "Maybe this will help explain the issue for those of us who are out of the loop on this subject. Net Neutrality 101 http://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&ai=BNcs1ohmsSKLVIZK0uAXumIHxA_C8hDyM6434A4Cj7o0M4JgXCAAQARgBILlUOAFQ38nv5vr_____AWDJ7tmKsKTsD8gBAYACAdkDN-8GpPR61c8&sig=AGiWqtw-jYzXmAmYkzUZ3djGSopKW-60qQ&q=http://www.savetheinternet.com/%3Dfaq\n What is Network Neutrality?\n \n Network Neutrality -- or \"Net Neutrality\" for short -- is the guiding principle that preserves the free and open Internet.\n \n Put simply, Net Neutrality means no discrimination. Net Neutrality prevents Internet providers from blocking, speeding up or slowing down Web content based on its source, ownership or destination.\n \n Net Neutrality is the reason why the Internet has driven economic innovation, democratic participation, and free speech online. It protects the consumer's right to use any equipment, content, application or service on a non-discriminatory basis without interference from the network provider. With Net Neutrality, the network's only job is to move data -- not choose which data to privilege with higher quality service.\n \n Learn more in Net Neutrality 101.\n \n Who wants to get rid of Net Neutrality?\n \n The nation's largest telephone and cable companies -- including AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Time Warner -- want to be Internet gatekeepers, deciding which Web sites go fast or slow and which won't load at all.\n \n They want to tax content providers to guarantee speedy delivery of their data. They want to discriminate in favor of their own search engines, Internet phone services, and streaming video -- while slowing down or blocking their competitors.\n \n These companies have a new vision for the Internet. Instead of an even playing field, they want to reserve express lanes for their own content and services -- or those from big corporations that can afford the steep tolls -- and leave the rest of us on a winding dirt road.\n \n The big phone and cable companies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying Congress and the Federal Communications Commission to gut Net Neutrality, putting the future of the Internet at risk. The bolded paragraph above tells me everything I need to know about why net neutrality must be protected.",

It reminds me of the \"fairness doctrine\" floating around again. \n \n Companies should be allowed to provide whatever service they want and if you don't like it then switch services. It isn't the governments job to run businesses. Government influence into companies should only be done if a businesses practices will end up costing the tax payers money on a reasonably big level. For example a company that pollutes like crazy causes the government to have to clean the rivers and provide health care for those who get sick from smog (this is a basic example). Very very rarely would I find a government action to influence business acceptable for any other reason.\n \n In the example given, FIOS blocks you from running a website from your house without upgrading. This is fair because you pay for a certain level of service yet suck up large amounts of bandwidth. Furthermore, a company may not want to get involved with lawsuits and therefore will ban downloads of music that are illegal or from a certain source (like LimeWire). The beauty of capitalism is you can always change companies. In my town I have over 10 choices for internet and the list is growing and growing.\n \n Go go John McCain for opposing yet another regulation body costing taxpayers more money and further \"nannying\" us.",
