   "What do you think of the idea that the WUSA was disbanded because of the lack of funding. Do you think there will be a comeback? Or our women's league as we know it will remain fallen? Personally I think there should be a comeback because if you look at how well we did at the Cup, we were awesome... 3rd place is killer man!",

   "That's not necessarily true... The only reason that WUSA is in ruins is because of the constant airing of all of their games. If WUSA had only aired a quarter of their games they would have made more money because the games that were aired did not make money from what games that are played for the NFL make through merchandise, condiments, admission and all that. I think that's why WUSA failed and if they are able to bring it back, they will have to fix that mistake. Cause The Women are not really that bad, they are excellent and if they can fix that then they will be great.",
