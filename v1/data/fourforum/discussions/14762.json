   "This is the very reason it's fairly easy for a rational person to believe that God is not real. \n Evil was not created by a God.. it was Created by man as a Nemesis to the God they created. They made up an all powerful, all knowing, Just and Loving Deity so they could not possibly blame him for anything bad that might happen , so Evil was created so their God didn't have to take the blame. \n If God did exist why would he even create evil to begin with?.. If God has a Plan and knows what will happen before it happens then why would anyone have a Choice? \n \" Here, I want you to stay in this Lovely Garden and eat anything you want, Oh but wait.. there's this one tree That will give you knowledge of good and evil.. don't touch that one...\" Are we really supposed to believe this?...\n \n This is a true story.. \n When I was 7 years old my sister, who was 9 at the time, was run over and killed by a car. She was getting off a church bus and the girl who hit her ran the light. The Preacher at our church came to our House to speak with my Mother. Her only question was WHY?.. Why would God take my Baby. \n The Preacher replied that GOD was testing my Mothers Faith by taking her child. I thought of this story later in life and determined that a Real God would have no need to test us. A Real God would never Kill an innocent child nor use that child to test a Mothers faith. This is when I realized that God is a lie, a fairy tale made up by primitive men to explain the meaning of life.",

   "Bad things happen to all people, religious or not. Being a christian doesn't protect a person from being murdered, or raped.. there's a very good reason for that too.. Because Life is just Life.. there is no God to protect anyone. \n \n Christianity just happens to be In my opinion the worst of the Worst when it comes to religion. Even the men in the Bible at one point believed in more than one God. Egyptians Believed in their Gods, and Jews Borrowed from them until Abraham came up with his own monotheistic religion and decided that HIS god was the only one which could possibly be real. The Idea of God \" Testing \" peoples faith came from the story of Abraham when God told him to kill his own son to prove his Faith ... Humanity carried it from there and to this day the religions When they don't have a legitimate answer to a question will always fall back on the \" God is testing you\" bull that they have repeated for centuries. \n \n Blind faith is the worst possible and single most devastating entity to the Human race. It doesn't matter to these people that there absolutely NO Scientific Evidence that a GOD even exists. It doesn't matter to these people that the religion itself is based on an old Egyptian fairy tale of the Savior of Humanity. It doesn't matter to these people that anyone with half a brain can easily show contradictions in the Bible. They go through life blindly believing and preaching to others about a place that doesn't exist . It's sad really.. John Adams said it best when he said The World would surely be a better place if there was less religion in it. I know it won't happen in my lifetime but one day in the future Humanity is going to wake up and realize that they have wasted centuries chasing immortality only to find that it's an impossible dream.",

And yet consider your religion the most \"tolerant\" and \"loving.\"\n \n \n 3 - While modern science, history, geology, biology, and physics have failed to convince you otherwise, some i-d-i-o-t rolling around on the floor speaking in \"tongues\" may be all the evidence you need to \"prove\" Christianity.\n \n 2 - You define 0.01% as a \"high success rate\" when it comes to answered prayers. You consider that to be evidence that prayer works. And you think that the remaining 99.99% FAILURE was simply the will of God.\n \n 1 - You actually know a lot less than many atheists and agnostics do about the Bible, Christianity, and church history - but still call yourself a Christian.",

Plus - Muhammad says, &#8220;kill innocent people and yourself if you love me.&#8221; Jesus Christ said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll die for you because I love you&#8221;).\n \n Fundamentalist Christians have also been responsible for terrible atrocities such as witch hunts and bigotry and has also been the biggest opposition to the advancements of mankind and scientific progression.\n \n 6. You say the Bible is full of fairytales and fables, yet you believe all life forms including plants, trees, insects, birds, fish, reptiles and mammals evolved from one species into another - As if evolution isn&#8217;t the biggest fairytale of them all.\n \n Again, this is a gross oversimplification of evolution. Evolution is much different than Jonah living inside a whale, Noah's Ark and a global flood, the serpent in the garden, parting the Red Sea, the wise men following a star, etc.\n \n 5. You laugh at the Supernatural, even though scientists have calculated the odds of life forming by natural processes to be estimated less than 1 chance in 10 to the 40,ooo power &#8211; But you find nothing wrong with believing that billions of years full of random mutations would result in the impossible.\n \n First of all, I'd love to see a source and what methodology was used to come up with that ridiculous estimation. \n \n I love when people use random odds like they really matter. What are the chances that your parents met out of all the people on earth? What are the chances that they had sex at a specific time so that a particular sperm could make the journey to fertilize one particular egg? Pretty tiny... Now those chances get even smaller when you apply the same reasoning to each of your parent's parents, and their parents, etc. Even if you only believe the earth is 6,000 years old (and thus a lot fewer generations), the chances that you came to exist are still extremely unlikely. But yet you do exist... and even if you didn't, another person would... and that person's existence would be equally unlikely.\n \n Billions of years of random mutations filtered by natural selection has resulted in the diversity of life, yes. But we don't believe that the diversity of life is 'impossible.' You are begging the question.\n \n 4. You accuse fundamental Christians of being intolerant, judgmental and hateful, while you foam at the mouth calling them freaking lunatics, ignorant, weak-minded, stupid fundies, and hateful bigots.\n \n In some cases this is true, but certainly not for everyone. It also works in reverse, though, as hypocrisy is definitely not for atheists only.\n \n 3. You ignore scientific concepts like cause and effect, and you don't realize that a closed system can be defined however the observer wants, so you throw out technological phrases to try to ignore the implications of thermodynamics by saying the laws of physics are not set in stone.\n \n Causality is a philosophical concept, not a scientific one. Apparently you don't understand closed systems, because I am assuming you are referring to earth (or the solar system) as one, and it simply isn't true. Also, the creationist argument that evolution violates the law stating that enthalpy increases with time is simply not true, in the same way that organizing data in your brain isn't violating it.\n \n 2. While all evidence, logic and reasoning point to a Creator and absolute truth, you prefer to hide behind relativism and a theory of evolution which does not, in fact, describe the creation of the universe at all, or why concepts of good and evil or morality exist.\n \n There is no logical reason or evidence to believe in a creator, therefore it is by definition unreasonable. \n \n Of course evolution does not explain the existence of the universe, nor does it claim to. There are other theories that attempt to explain that, but even so, there is nothing wrong with not knowing for sure how it came to be. Not understanding how something happens doesn't mean that it is divine intervention.\n \n There are plenty of non-religious explanations for morality, based on the fact that humans are a social species. To make it very simple, as a human, I do not want to be murdered, attacked, or raped, and I do not want my property stolen. I also know that if I do these things, other people will not want to be around me. Everyone has to obey certain rules or an organized society could not exist. That said, if the morality of the bible was to be followed, you would end up with a place that looked more like Iraq or Iran than the United States. \n \n Evolution of morality - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \n 1. *Atheism fails to adequately explain the existence of eternal, unchanging truths, for it rejects the existence of an eternal unchanging mind. Atheism cannot offer man any eternal significance whatsoever. Temporary meaning in life is insufficient, for our accomplishments die with the death of the universe -- there is no ultimate purpose in a universe void of God.\n \n Atheism doesn't attempt to explain anything. That said, I'm not sure that there are eternal truths or absolute morals or anything like that. Even killing is necessary at times.\n \n If you're life has no meaning outside of your belief in a God, then I truly feel sorry for you.\n \n \n\n \n Xcaliber made it look fun, so I had to give it a shot.\n \n edit: Oh, and I forgot to add 'You're BUSTED.'",

   "I actually have EZ on ignore, but having seen this thing quoted by others, I just thought I'd add my two cents.\n \n \n10. You vigorously deny the existence of God, yet you frequently blame Him for all the \"evils\" in the world, all the natural disasters, and everything else under the sun that is wrong in modern society.\n\n \n As an atheist, I blame God for absolutely nothing. Hard to blame something that I don't think exists.\n \n But I blame humans who erroneously believe in God for a lot.\n \n \n9. You feel insulted and \"dehumanized\" when creationists say that people were created in the image and likeness of God, but you have no problem with the evolutionist claim that we all evolved from slime by a cosmic accident.\n\n \n I don't feel the least bit insulted or dehumanized by Creationists stating that. I simply think it's incorrect.\n \n But I also feel profoundly connected to all of the world by the idea that our species has evolved over time.\n \n (And I would add yet again that \"evolved from slime by a cosmic accident\" is just one more characterization of evolution that adds unnecessary theological or philosophical implications into what the science says. Evolution does not imply atheism.)\n \n \n8. You criticize fundamental Christians who believe the Bible, and say that it can't possibly be true because it's just a book written by mere men, yet you never question any of Darwin's writings or Richard Dawkins' books.\n\n \n Guess what? Darwin was wrong about many things, most notably how inheritance worked. This has been shown by biologists who, in direct contradiction to your claim, have questioned his work.\n \n But he was right about the mechanism of adaptive evolution being natural selection and about how speciation occurs. And this has been supported by vast quantities of empirical evidence, also produced by biologists. The fact that he was wrong about certain details or about other issues is irrelevant.\n \n As for Dawkins, biologists question him all the time, on issues ranging from biology itself (e.g. his gradualism or his gene-centric view of selection) to the implications of nature for theism (e.g. that the world is as we should expect it to be if it were not designed by a benevolent creator). Again, your claim is directly contradicted by the facts.\n \n \n7. You can't seem to understand the primary differences between fundamental Muslims and fundamental Christians (hint: strap-on TNT. Plus - Muhammad says, &#8220;kill innocent people and yourself if you love me.&#8221; Jesus Christ said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll die for you because I love you&#8221;).\n\n \n Yes, well, this sort of problem comes under the heading of blaming humans who erroneously believe in God, whether we're talking Yahweh or Allah. Because religious terrorism is hardly limited to any one religion.\n \n As I recall, professed Christians like Scott Roeder and Eric Rudolph have been known to kill in the name of religion. Meanwhile, a look at various books of the Old Testament or at Revelation in the New certainly does not yield a deity who rejects all killing, even of innocent human beings (or even of innocent non-human beings!).\n \n And I would certainly say that Islamic terrorism deserves every bit as much condemnation as Christian.\n \n \n6. You say the Bible is full of fairytales and fables, yet you believe all life forms including plants, trees, insects, birds, fish, reptiles and mammals evolved from one species into another - As if evolution isn&#8217;t the biggest fairytale of them all.\n\n \n Sound and fury, signifying nothing. You can call evolution a fairytale all you want. It won't make the evidence disappear. The genetics and the fossils support the notion of billions of years of evolution since our microbial ancestors, and hundreds of millions of years of evolution since the earliest multicellular organisms. I find that vastly more comprehensible than the literal magic of creationism.\n \n Moreover, the archaeological and linguistic evidence indicates that the Bible is not literally true -- anything from the various names of God used in systematically different ways (Yahweh being far from the only one, and Elohim being a plural, for pity's sake; and dig on what the 82nd Psalm says, keeping in mind that scare-quotes did not exist in ancient Hebrew), to the discovery and excavation of Canaanite cities (e.g. Ugarit, whose documents cast a fascinating light on the development of religion in the region).\n \n Does the Bible's literal falsity mean it has no value? Not necessarily. It has minimal value as history, but some of its lessons are morally or even spiritually (if there is such a thing as spirit) valuable, especially where the figure of Jesus is concerned. And I don't see this as diminished by its lack of historical accuracy. It's not an all-or-nothing issue. But the value of a lesson doesn't make the history true.\n \n \n5. You laugh at the Supernatural, even though scientists have calculated the odds of life forming by natural processes to be estimated less than 1 chance in 10 to the 40,ooo power &#8211; But you find nothing wrong with believing that billions of years full of random mutations would result in the impossible.\n\n \n I would like to know what \"scientists have calculated\" these \"odds.\" Because creationists notoriously make claims about probabilities that have no basis in actual facts.\n \n Meanwhile, the everyday of math of mutation rates and selection coefficients is more than powerful enough to prove how evolution can happen. This is especially the case when we're dealing with organisms with rapid generation times and vast numbers of offspring. The math is all on the side of evolution.\n \n But yes, I do \"laugh at the supernatural.\" It's magic, nothing more. Certainly not an explanation of any kind. \"God said, Let there be\" -- great, how does that work? Poof! Whatever. You can believe in magic if you like -- but then don't be surprised when people describe your view as a \"fairytale.\"\n \n \n4. You accuse fundamental Christians of being intolerant, judgmental and hateful, while you foam at the mouth calling them freaking lunatics, ignorant, weak-minded, stupid fundies, and hateful bigots.\n\n \n I tend not to call them lunatics or other names myself. But I have never met a Christian fundamentalist who even knew much about the Bible -- many barely know what it says, let alone its history (e.g. how it was compiled and when) -- to say nothing of how well they know the sciences, especially evolution and the Big Bang. Experience has taught me that they are ignorant of such matters. That's no sin, nor is pointing it out.\n \n On the other hand, the record of fundamentalist Christians denigrating and -- literally -- demonizing their opponents is vast. At the very least, this criticism cuts both ways, yes?\n \n \n3. You ignore scientific concepts like cause and effect, and you don't realize that a closed system can be defined however the observer wants, so you throw out technological phrases to try to ignore the implications of thermodynamics by saying the laws of physics are not set in stone.\n\n \n I defy you to show biologists ignoring cause-and-effect relationships. Even one example.\n \n As for the \"evolution denies the Second Law\" objection, this has been addressed so many times, it needs no further mention here.\n \n And I also know of not one biologist who thinks the laws of physics are variable. On the other hand, I have seen many creationists make such arguments -- about everything from the speed of light to radioactive decay -- in order to explain how the world could give exactly the appearance it does, while being only a few thousand years old. Henry Morris is particularly well known for these \"appearance of age\" arguments.\n \n It never seems to occur to such creationists that what they are saying is that God is actively engaged in deception: he makes the world appear to be one age, while in fact it's another. They worship a Lord of Lies.\n \n \n2. While all evidence, logic and reasoning point to a Creator and absolute truth, you prefer to hide behind relativism and a theory of evolution which does not, in fact, describe the creation of the universe at all, or why concepts of good and evil or morality exist.\n\n \n Evolution does not explain why the universe exists. Nor does it claim to.\n \n Evolution actually does explain a great deal more about human morality than you might think. Check out The Moral Animal by Robert Wright.\n \n Evolution certainly does not require moral relativism, whereby any one moral view is considered as good as any other. Ken Ham's \"different starting points\" argument, however, is a perfect example of cognitive relativism.\n \n As to what \"all evidence, logic and reasoning point to,\" well, if it were that simple, we wouldn't be having this conversation.\n \n And \"absolute truth\" is beyond the possession of any human being. It might make you feel better. But you don't have it, any more than I do. Such is not the lot of finite and impermanent beings such as ourselves.\n \n \n1. *Atheism fails to adequately explain the existence of eternal, unchanging truths, for it rejects the existence of an eternal unchanging mind. Atheism cannot offer man any eternal significance whatsoever. Temporary meaning in life is insufficient, for our accomplishments die with the death of the universe -- there is no ultimate purpose in a universe void of God.\n\n \n And here I would merely ask, why is \"temporary meaning in life\" at all \"insufficient?\" Insufficient for what? According to whom? My life won't go on forever. I can live with that.\n \n This is the classic all-or-nothing that Nietzsche rightly diagnosed as the reason why Christianity itself is the root cause of nihilism: either there is an \"ultimate purpose,\" an \"eternal, unchanging\" meaning -- or there is no purpose and meaning at all. It's that whole dichotomy that, as an atheist, I reject.\n \n There is plenty of meaning and purpose. But it's limited and temporary. And that's fine. The meanings I find and the purposes I set aren't unimportant to me, just because a billion years from now, they won't be important to the universe. So what? They matter to me, and to those who care about me (just as their meanings and purposes matter to them, and to me). And that's enough.\n \n I'll take you off ignore at last for now, EZ, to see how you respond (if at all).",
