What about all the other people who became a vegetable and waited and hoped for a cure while in their state, and it never came. While a cure is possible, its also just a hope. For current technology a cure for a this problem is far. Its not life to live like that. Terri is not living her life, she is just existing by breathing. What is the point?\n\n \n People seem to have a difficult time understanding her condition. She is not in a coma, she is not unconscious, she is not hadicapped, she is not simply unable to feed herself. She is profoundly brain damaged. This is what occurs when you suffer a cardiac arrest with a down time greater than a few minutes. Brain cells die due to a lack of or depleated supply of oxygen. Like cardiac cells, once brain cells are dead, they DO NOT regenerate  themselves. There is no technology capable of making these cells come back to life. In fact, the research aimed at making that technology possible in the future (stem cell research) is strongly opposed by the republicans. Sounds like pandering for the congressional vote to me. Terri is not brain dead, as her \"brain stem\" (the part responsible for regulation of cardiac and respiratory cycles) is still functioning. The rest of her brain is dead. And the rest of the brain, is what makes us sentient human beings.

No debate, no new tests needed. An MRI is worthless in this situation (which is what her parents wanted). Independant, impartial, court appointed doctors ruled on this.\n \n Fact: Her husband has managed to convince not one court, but 11 that he knows his wifes wishes better than her parents.\n \n Fact: He has already been exonerated IN COURT for the abuse allegations. Doctors called the speculation that he caused the brain damage by choking his wife \"rediculous\"\n \n Fact: There is no finacial incentive for him to kill her, but there is great fiancial gain for him if he simply agreed to keep her alive. \n \n Thesea re the fact of the case.

By proxy, you are essentially saying that the judges who sat on this case, over 20 of them, who were actually THERE IN THE COURTROOM, were wrong, but all these bafoons running around playing second guess the experts are correct.\n \n I, for one, called my senators this morning and made it unquestionably clear that if they participated in any sort of political grandstanding over this I would do everything within my power, including providing substantial funding, to get them ousted and a representative who actually represents the people installed at the next election. \n \n This is a big, stupid political ply that is going to backfire in the republicans faces. While it may garner them support from the fundies, the damage they have done to their libertarin leaning support by putting the federal government smack dab in the middle of a fmaily affair is incalculable.

And who cares when he ordered it, he has a DNR order, and had every right to file for it whenever he wanted. And if you have ever seen a DNR order or similar advanced directive, denial of antibiotics to treat infection is normally one of the options available on the form.\n \n \nNumerous?

And according to their timeline, Michael was awarded a 600K settlement, could this have been where the money paid to his lawyer came from? Above you said 400K, now you say 500K, what is it? And are you in the position to know just what Terri's best interests are? Suppose Terri really does not want to be kept alive by artificial devices as Michael claims? Unless you have specifically talked to Terri, you have no clue what she wanted done. How can you talk about what is in her best interests when you don't even understand her condition? Go edumacate yourself a little about the cerebral cortex, it's function, EEG's, CT scans, and then come back and talk to me. \n \n \nHe didn't stick through ****. He has a common law wife and two kids with her. You must really buy the media BS to think that he's been her advocate .Since 1993, he did everything that he could to insure her death.\n\n And if that is what Terri wanted, he is being an advocate...that is the definition of the word. So what he has a common law wife. Terri is dead, her body is not. He could have totally washed his hands of this a long time ago, however he is still fighting for what he says Terri wanted. And unfortunately for Terri's parents, he is the only one legally responsible for conveying Terri's wishes. Again I ask, what does he have to benefit from all of this? \n \n \n He refused to allow medical care when she got infections, refused to allow rehabilitation that would have allowed her to swallow on her own.\n\n All of which is his legal right.\n \n \n 14 different doctors filed statements that said the quality of her life would improve with therapy. Agreed, nobody said that she'd be normal again, but is that a reason to kill anyone? If so, why don't we mow down everyone receiving ADA money?\n\n Again, learn a little more about a non-functional cerebral cortex, then come talk to me about rehab and therapy. Not possible.\n \n \nIf he was truly devoted to Terri, why would he start a new life with another woman while Terri was still alive? why would he refuse to let Terri's parents see her health records or visit or allow them to bring in doctors to help her?\n He's pond scum, I'll stand by that analysis.\n Oh, and if allowing your wife to die slowly by starvation is love, I hope that my wife never loves me that much if I'm in a similar circumstance. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n Define alive. Terri has no concept that she is alive, that Michael has another woman, or even that anyone is in the room with her. It's not like if I were to go out and sleep with another woman and lie to my wife about it. He has been trying to allow Terri's body to die for years. We pull people off of respirators all the time after they are determined to be brain dead, and nobody says a damn thing about it. There is no help for Terri, other than letting the inevitable happen. The only difference here is that her parents are unable to let go and face reality. \n \n I'm sure that if the state would allow a lethal injection of some sort, Michael would be pleased to do it. I think this would be better. I would even give the injection if I could. You and the rest of the people who are fighting to keep this shell alive are uneducated, unrealistic, meddling cause heads. I'll stand by that analysis.",

   "This round certainly goes to the democrats.\n\n \n It very well may, for the usual reason. The Democrats have such a good ally in the liberal news media. A large part of the reason 70% of Americans favor \"pulling the plug\", is because the poll question was asked in a dishonest way. She was not on \"life support\", she had a feeding tube. A world of difference.\n \n \n Michelle Malkin\n \n The problem is that, contrary to what ABC News told those polled, Terri Schiavo is not on \"life support\" and has never been on \"life support.\" The loaded phrase evokes images of a comatose patient being artificially sustained by myriad machines and pumps and wires. Terri was on a feeding tube. A feeding tube is not a ventilator. Terri can breathe just fine on her own.\n \n And as many of her medical caretakers and parents have argued, if given proper rehabilitation, Terri could learn to chew and swallow on her own as well. She is disabled, not dead.\n \n But ABC News did not see fit to inform either the poll takers or its viewers of the truth. Instead, it misled them -- and the result was a poll response that produced -- voila! -- \"broad public disapproval\" for any government intervention to spare Terri from slowly starving to death. Blogger Ed Morrissey of Captain's Quarters (captainsquartersblog.com) noted: \"Either ABC is completely incompetent in conducting research, or they have attempted to fool their viewers and readership with false polling that essentially lies about the case in question. Since when does ABC conduct push polling for euthanasia?\"\n \n Imagine how the poll results might have turned out if ABC News had made clear to participants that Terri is not terminally ill. Not in excruciating pain. Capable of saying \"Mommy\" and \"Help me.\" And of \"getting the feeling she's falling\" or getting \"excited,\" in her husband's own testimony, when her head is not held properly.\n \n Imagine how the poll results might have turned out if ABC News had informed participants that in a sworn affidavit, registered nurse Carla Sauer Iyer, who worked at the Palm Garden of Largo Convalescent Center in Largo, Fla., while Terri Schiavo was a patient there, testified: \"Throughout my time at Palm Gardens, Michael Schiavo was focused on Terri's death. Michael would say 'When is she going to die?' 'Has she died yet?' and 'When is that bitch gonna die?'\" \n\n \n When most people see video of this disabled women on television, it's understandable that they might think she is beyond hope. The fact is, there are untold thousands of people of all ages in similar conditions all across the U.S. I routinely saw children this way in my past occupation, when I substitute drove special education school buses. Those kids were transportated back and fourth to schools, and they had no more of an idea which way was up than this woman. Most people like that have one thing in common - they have parents who are willing to care for them. \n \n If she dies, I wouldn't chalk up any victory for Democrats.",

This was not the ridiculous \"friend\" testimony, which was thoroughly debunked by the witnesses own husband was it? \nThe one from the beach may have been the \"friend\" testimony. I think another came from a nurse.\n \n ...and yesterday there was something mentioned about a nurse who was fired after revealing that M. Schiavo likely administered insulin to Terri in an attempt to kill her. Since the nurse only noticed the empty vial and the condition of Terri Schiavo immediately after M. Schiavo was in the room, she could not testify that he actually gave her a shot. She was fired for bringing it up. \n \n \n \nOver 20 judges have been involved in this over the years. Any one of them could have removed Terri from her husbands custody with the swipe of a pen, but none did. There have been thousands of hours of testimony, and you have based your decision on a snippet of a transcript that has been cherry picked to support an agenda.\nIt's enough to establish reasonable doubt of M. Schiavo's claim to know that his wife wants to die.\n \n \n \n\n She is a veggie, she is never going to get better, regardless of what they do. The only argument here is who is most likely to have kjnown her wishes, her parents, or her husband. A LOT (EVERY) of judges who were fully acquainted with the facts of the case say her husband. All evidence points not to her husband being some greedy slimeball, but to him being a good man who has fought a very long, very expensive battle to have his wifes wishes carried out.\nBut some evidence points to a possibility that he is wrong or lying. Whether she's a veggie or not does not remove the possibility that she has a right to live.\n \n \n \n\n BUT, you heard something that MIGHT have come from the courts transcipts, a few minutes of testimony out of thousands of hours of testimony that has taken place in this case, and that has convinced you that all the judges were wrong.\nNot that they are wrong...that they are being hasty. Since she will die anyway if they delay much longer in reinserting the tube, they should err on the side of life. Once dead, always dead.\n \n \n \n\n And you have the nerve to suggest that the other sides arguments here are devoid of logic?\nThat's not what I said. What I said was: (bold)\n \n ....you seem to be forgetting that liberals don't listen to facts and logic. \n \n Often, liberals will ignore the logic presented by opponents.\n \n That's quite different from saying there is no logic in their argument.\n \n There is logic in your argument here, but you seem to be ignoring the possibility that M.

I'm not saying she did. I just think it ludicrous to starve her to death and it's just as ludicrous to not look into all of these claims.",

   "It very well may, for the usual reason. The Democrats have such a good ally in the liberal news media. A large part of the reason 70% of Americans favor \"pulling the plug\", is because the poll question was asked in a dishonest way. She was not on \"life support\", she had a feeding tube. A world of difference.\n\n I find it rather comical then that when asked in my original poll \"should the feeding tube be removed\" that 71.43% of the respondents answered yes. I think the general public (namely those motivated enough to answer the poll) have heard enough about this case to understand what the poll was about. The feeding tube is her life support. Life support does not only refer to a respirator.\n \n \n \nWhen most people see video of this disabled women on television, it's understandable that they might think she is beyond hope. The fact is, there are untold thousands of people of all ages in similar conditions all across the U.S. I routinely saw children this way in my past occupation, when I substitute drove special education school buses. Those kids were transportated back and fourth to schools, and they had no more of an idea which way was up than this woman. Most people like that have one thing in common - they have parents who are willing to care for them. \n\n It depends upon what you call hope. Is there hope that Terri will one day wake up and start singing? NO. Is there hope that Terri will ever walk again? NO Is there hope that Terri will ever even be conscious that she is alive? NO. Everyone here on this forum who is screaming to keep Terri alive needs to go do a little reading about non-functional cerebral cortex. Terri is\n simply a living body, devoid of feelings, pain, thoughts, consciousness, suffering, or the ability to respond to anything in her environment. What you see in these videos is reflex reaction, just like when the doctor hits you on the knee with a hammer and your leg jumps. I know it can be hard for people to understand this concept, but it is a scientific fact. \n \n Her husband is the legal POA, he has made a decision based on what Terri wanted. It should have been honored a long time ago. It is shameful to support putting the husband through all this, as well as continue to allow the parents their delusions.",

A doctor form the parents says she's not in a PVS, then a doctor from the husband says she is, the the parents get another doctor...etc...etc...etc. A court appointed, impartial physician has determined (with modern, and technologically accepted equipment and testing) that she is in a PVS.

   "Both of which are presented only from the point of view of the parents and their lawyers. What about the other side? To be fair and objective, both sides need equal consideration.\n\n The point of the post was to show that there's reasonable reason to keep her alive while a new trial is caried out.\n \n\n And again, other doctors have stated that she is an empty shell devoid of any chance of a meaningful recovery. Remember, both sides need to be considered here. Knowing what I do about EEG's and CT scans and neurophysiology, I know better than to think she can be rehabilitated. \n\n Don't you think that if there's not medical agreement that she's brain dead, they should err on the side of life?\n \n\n So then what is his motivation for continuing the fight? Money that he has already spent and is not allowed to access in the first place? I'm having a hard time understanding how this is considered motivation.\n\n We don't know the terms of his access to HER settlement money. It's a sealed settlement.\n \n\n The cashcow that is not providing him with any money? And who cares when he ordered it, he has a DNR order, and had every right to file for it whenever he wanted. And if you have ever seen a DNR order or similar advanced directive, denial of antibiotics to treat infection is normally one of the options available on the form.\n\n And you don't find it fishy that he was doing all he could to keep her alive until the insurance company cut the checks? \n \n\n It is not his lawyers decision to make, it is his. And what Terri's family has to say about it hardly denies the fact that the offer was made, and that M. Schiavo turned it down.\n\n His lawyer supposedly acts in his best interests and as such, advises him what to do. How much influence he has is unknown.\n \n\n Sure, he could have. And according to their timeline, Michael was awarded a 600K settlement, could this have been where the money paid to his lawyer came from? Above you said 400K, now you say 500K, what is it? \n\n Michael's lawyers (plural) were paid from Terri's healthcare money. That's part of the legal documents from Judge Greer. $400k went to Felos, ~$100k went to Michael's other legal representatives. NONE of it came from HIS settlement check.\n \n\n And are you in the position to know just what Terri's best interests are? Suppose Terri really does not want to be kept alive by artificial devices as Michael claims? Unless you have specifically talked to Terri, you have no clue what she wanted done. How can you talk about what is in her best interests when you don't even understand her condition? Go edumacate yourself a little about the cerebral cortex, it's function, EEG's, CT scans, and then come back and talk to me.\n\n Idon't know what her wishes are and Michael's statements can be considered nothing but heresay. IMO, with a lack of specific instruction, you err on the side of life. Michael's refusal to allow any doctor, other than his handpicked doctors, to evaluate Terri causes doubt about his motives and since he has a financial stake in her death, he is hardly an advocate for her.\n \n\n And if that is what Terri wanted, he is being an advocate...that is the definition of the word. So what he has a common law wife. Terri is dead, her body is not. He could have totally washed his hands of this a long time ago, however he is still fighting for what he says Terri wanted. And unfortunately for Terri's parents, he is the only one legally responsible for conveying Terri's wishes. Again I ask, what does he have to benefit from all of this? \n\n As I said above, the terms of Terri's settlement were sealed, so we don't know what happens to any money left afyter she dies.\n \n\n Again, learn a little more about a non-functional cerebral cortex, then come talk to me about rehab and therapy. Not possible.\n\n And that's not a position that's universally held my the doctors looking into the case. 14 said she didn't meet the criteria of PVS. To me, that's enough of a reason to procede with caution.\n \n\n Define alive. Terri has no concept that she is alive, that Michael has another woman, or even that anyone is in the room with her. It's not like if I were to go out and sleep with another woman and lie to my wife about it. He has been trying to allow Terri's body to die for years. We pull people off of respirators all the time after they are determined to be brain dead, and nobody says a damn thing about it. There is no help for Terri, other than letting the inevitable happen. The only difference here is that her parents are unable to let go and face reality. \n\n She's not on a respirator. She's breathing spontaneously. And doctors have testified that she can swallow on her own as well. \n \n\n I'm sure that if the state would allow a lethal injection of some sort, Michael would be pleased to do it. I think this would be better. I would even give the injection if I could. You and the rest of the people who are fighting to keep this shell alive are uneducated, unrealistic, meddling cause heads. I'll stand by that analysis.\n\n Yep, datz me, an unejimicated fool....according to someone who's proud to wear the moniker \"snakespit\". emoticon_rolleyes :xcensored",

   "\n \n And, yes, I agree with you in part about people not saying \"I saw her do this, and I saw her do that\". However, it is a violation of medical ethics and Pt. confidentiality laws for anyone involved in Terri's care or someone who use to be involved in Terri's care to speak about anything that is not already common knowledge. Again, last night of On the Record with Greta, they had a former CNA (certified Nursing Assistant) who spoke about Terri. If anyone saw the program, you would know that first off, she did not seem to be the brightest bulb in the box. When pressed by Greta for information, she stated that she had never seen Terri responsive to anything, and that Terri was in a coma. Now obviously, Terri is not in a coma, but she seemed to have the right idea...Terri is unable to interact with her environment. She did not violate Pt. confidentiality by saying these things, as this information has already been made public knowledge. But for a someone working with or around Terri, including a cleaning lady who mops her floor to run out and say anything about Terri that has not been released by the family or the families appointed representative, it is against the law. I think, I am not 100% sure, but I think one of Terri's former nurses was dismissed for doing that very thing. I will look to see if I can find any information about that.\nI have enough confidence in the human race to say that if there are those out there that had observed positive signs from Terri, they'd say so, confidentiality laws be damned - brightest bulb or not - correct terminology or not. IF IF IF my vote counted and IF IF IF any witness wanted to come forward, I'd be prepared to listen to the cleaning lady who could say Terri's eyes followed her around the room. That she always talked to Terri as she worked and Terri made noises in response. If it were the case, there should be a fairly long string of low wattage bulbs out there wanting to tell a similar tale. At this point, do you honestly think there would be a lawsuit against a nurse's aide? Or is it criminal? What prosecutor would do it?\n \n No I didn't see that last evening. But that CNA did relay what she had personally observed. Did she seem believable and unbiased? It's all about the court of public opinion. The Schindlers have sought out the media for that purpose.\n \n As for the nurse, I did see that interview. According to her, she was officially fired for poor judgement regarding patient care. Of course, neither she nor the employer are sharing the details of that. She also accused the husband of attempted murder with insulin. The police didn't even investigate. Evidently the nurse didn't strike the police as believable or unbiased.",

   "My personal opinion is right to life. As far as I am concerned, no one can make decisions for you. Unfortunately, the law sees it differently.\n \n 1.) Who decides who should live or die?\n 2.) What is Terri's condition?\n 3.) Why did this happen to Terri?\n 4.) Is there a chance for recovery?\n 5.) Does she suffer?\n 6.) What reasons does she have for living?\n 7.) What reasons do we have for pulling the plug?\n 8.) What part does Michael play in all of this?\n 9.) What part do Terri's parents play?\n \n 1.) I believe that all people have a right to life or death. In a perfect world, that choice should only be made solely by them. Terri cannot answer for herself, and her wishes can never be known. Not even by Michael's 'opinion'.\n \n From my philosophical point of view, preservation of life is the most important value you can place on life. It is unethical and anti-climactic to kill except to preserve or protect life. Even in the animal kingdom, lions do not deplete their entire food source. When everything is dead, life has no value.\n \n 2.) Terri's condition is a persistent vegatative state. She stopped breathing for whatever reason. Don't believe everything you read in the paper. Initial damage was caused by lack of oxygen, although after her resucitation, she was clearly capable of some communication. Her state has deteriorated to the point of complete pvs. The brainscan shows her cerebral cortex. A deteriorating membrane on top of which rests cerebral-spinal fluid.\n \n 3.) Most likely, no one will ever know why this happened to Terri; a relatively healthy 25 year old woman. The interesting part about this is that original prognosis included possibilities of suffocation and asphixiation. Broken bones and bruises from her legs to her neck indicated possible physical attack and were later dismissed as 'unfounded' in a court of law. They were pawned off as damages from seizure during her 'heart attack'. Later, the prognosis became that she suffered from a lack of 'potassium', an element that helps fire brain neurons and carry oxygen throughout the body. Lack of potassium in most patients causes the development of arthritis, body pains, and numbness as precursors of a serious condition. Potassium, like flouride, is found in most drinking water.\n \n I got around to thinking about this. Potassium can be blocked or removed by certain chemicals and poisons. Scorpions, snakes, and even more commonly, household pesticides, can completely alter potassium levels and cause neurons to misfire or stop firing. Pesticides are not commonly tested in blood tests. Just an interesting tidbit.\n \n 4.) Terri's chances for survival at this point are slim to none. Any hope of recovery that she may have once had are gone, in part due to the poor treatment by caregivers and Michael not allowing her adequate care. However, miracles happen all the time. Sarah Scantlin and Terry Wallis are two people who, within the last 2 years, have both awakened from 20 year comas. Their stories are legendary and unheard of in science and raises new suspicions by scientists that the brain is, infact, capable of regeneration. It is also interesting that when a part of the brain is rendered dysfunctional, other portions of the brain are sometimes able to take over its work. No possibility should ever be ignored.\n \n 5.) It cannot be known whether or not she suffers. We say she suffers because we are saddened by her appearance and her story. She is most likely brain dead beyond the point of feeling anything. But no one can know and she cannot tell us.\n \n 6.) Terri, if nothing else, could have been a staple for science and a chance for us to learn something, but at this point, Michael just wants her dead. There really isn't a reason to pull the plug.\n \n 7.) There really isn't one. Well, actually, so Michael can legally marry his girlfriend and stop paying medical costs on Terri. But more likely, just to hide something.\n \n 8.) What is interesting is that Michael has a little history of being abusive. The testimony of a girlfriend that he was with depicted him as a jealous, abusive, \u00e0sshole. Unfortunately, there is little substantiation to a girl's testimony. Nurses also concluded that Michael was abusive, but once again, accusations apparently mean little in court. Terri's brother indicated that Terri was miserable in her relationship and wanted a divorce. Interestingly, Michael been a health care worker for sometime. He was certified in CPR and failed to administer it when Terri had her seizure.\n \n Law is more about having resources and a good liar, ahem, lawyer, to present and protect your case rather than finding truth. Michael had access to Terri's medical funds to pay for his court presence. He had the resources he needed to bend a verdict anyway he wanted. Court is not infallible. Think OJ Simpson.\n \n 9.)

That was my point pretty much, they don't just pull the plug. And she's not an insect.\n \n She stopped breathing because her heart stopped.

ALL of the physicians that had seen her directly after the incident had indicated that she was aware of her immediate surroundings. The video tapes are not available via Michael's request. \n \n I believe that the accepted diagnosis is a cardiac arrest (not the same thing as a heart attack) caused by a metabolic imbalance. It is believed and until recently, had not been disputed, that Terri was bulemic, and this caused the metabolic imbalance. \n \n  No, the accepted diagnosis was that she suffered from a potassium deficiency which she was promptly treated for when she reached the hospital.

The brain can \"rechannel\" it's electrical impulses in order to allow optimal function of the living brain that remains. \n \n  Umm, yes they do. This is simple biology fact. In the event that a portion of your brain is damaged, say the temporal cortex, your Broca's area, wirnicke's area, and occipital lobes are all transversly capable of correcting the failure of those areas. The brain is capable or relearning and restoring the functions of speech, hearing, and vision from other capable areas. \n \n 7.

Either or, it's 100% irrelevant. Saying it now, or later, isn't part of the law. If judges started making up laws out of thin air, they'd be bishops and popes, not judges.\n \n Secondly, two reasons come to mind.\n #1 Most sane people, I assume, aren't ready emotionally to put their loved one to death immediately, before some period of time passes where you can be SURE, there isn't hope. \n #2 Allowing heresay evidence from what I understand, wasn't allowed when it happened, but at some point later was allowed. He then pursued it. These are the sorts of things the court uncovers, not republican propoganda. \n \n \nI don't doubt that it is legally acceptable for M to state what T said she wanted. I have a problem believing T ever said anything of the sort.\n\n Then case closed, you agree that the judges interpereted the law correctly. End of theatrics. Although you can proceed to disuscuss NEW laws that might change it, you CANNOT claim the judges were not upholding the law, and you cannot claim the facts are being ignored. Both are simply false.\n \n \nHowever, since she can't speak for herself, I guess we're all supposed to trust M and let her die. That's all the court is saying.\n\n No, that's what the law says, the judges have just ruled on it.\n \n \n\n The judge should not ignore M's legal standing. He should question the truthfulness of M's claim about T's wishes. He should consider conflicting testimony from people who heard M say differently.\n\n They, (multiple judges) have. They ruled. Case closed.\n \n \nI'll agree he's a bad husband, but not fault him for his animal urges. He should have divorced T years ago and married his girlfriend, leaving the care of his ex-wife to those who really care for her. But then, he'd lose control of the 700,000 wouldn't he?\n\n And control over enforcing his wife's last wishes. What's more important to you. 700K that you won't ever actually get (it's gone Jim), or the woman you loved and married being allowed to die in dignity as she communicated to you? Easy isn't it?\n \n \nThere seems to have been testimony to refute this.\n\n No, not refute, contrary to. Judges weigh evidence, and rule. Testimony often comes down to he-said-she-said. It's the judges power to rule on it.\n \n \nIt appears the judges may be ignoring pertinent evidence.\n\n \n They don't ignore it, they factor it in. But ultimately it comes down to either-or, in this case, M. Shiavo has the right, he exercised that right, the courts upheld his legal right.\n \n -Mach",

   "I see three major problems with Terri's case:\n \n 1) Michael Schiavo should not have been the guardian. Having the spouse as guardian is a reasonable default, but it should be open to challenge. Certainly it would be unreasonable to appoint the spouse as guardian after a couple had filed for divorce, and once Michael moved on with his life - moved in with his girlfriend and started a family with her - there is not a court in the country that would have denied Terri a divorce. But Judge George Greer made certain that Terri had no one to speak for her.\n \n 2) Terri's wishes: Several years after the original incident (and after the malpractice suit money came in), Michael and a couple of his relatives submitted affadavits that Terri would not have wanted to live in that condition. Several of Terri's friends submitted affadavits that, for the first few years, they had heard Michael tell people that he had no idea what Terri would have wanted. In a classic case of he said / she said, based on hearsay evidence that would not support a $10 fine for jaywalking, Judge George Greer sentenced Terri to death. \n \n The appellate courts looked only for dotted i's and crossed t's, but none of them ever reviewed the facts of the case. I can guarantee that if Terri had been sentenced on the basis of an alleged crime, the appellate courts would have fallen all over themselves to send the case back for retrial. But there was no crime.\n \n 3) The method of execution was slow and barbaric, far beyond \"cruel and unusual.\" Terri's mother was denied the opportunity to offer any comfort to her dying daughter - water for her parched lips, or a sliver of ice for her swollen tongue. What was Judge George Greer afraid of? Was he afraid she would choke to death and end her suffering too early?

Why is it not life support? A life support implement only does what the Pt. is incapable of doing for themselves.

   "That's a pretty big if. We'll never know. The judge looked at the contradictory hearsay evidence, and made the disgracefully arbitrary decision to order her execution.\n\n The man who was responsible for conveying Terri's wishes did so. Legally, he is the only one who was capable of stating what Terri wanted, being that he was her spouse. And I am guessing that he knew Terri much better than you did. So your OPINION about what she may or may not have wanted is just that, nothing more than your opinion. \n \n \nYou are playing word games by confusing sentient with being self-aware. The only species on the planet known to be self-aware, capable of thinking of \"I\" or \"me\" as an individual, is mankind (although researchers have suggested that whales and maybe dolphins might be included).

Your attempt to justify killing a severely disabled person on the basis that she is subhuman is the same reasoning the Nazi thugs used, and is still despicable.\n\n No I am not playing word games. Do you have any support for your notion about self awareness? Perhaps a few links to like minded information? If you read the above definition, again, not my definition, it does state \"aware\". Not self aware, just aware. But I challenge you to find many people who do not think that dogs or most other animals possess the quality of being self aware. Go to the thread about \"sentient beings\" and post your info and (il)logic. I would be curious to see you debate your position. And how was this killing a severely disabled person. It was removing a persistently vegatative person from life support, and allowing her to die. Doctors do this all the time, what makes this case any different. It was shown prior to removing the feeding tube that she was a vegatable, and proven again in the autopsy. What is the difference? \n \n \nVery true. There would have been no fuss in this case either if the decision had been made in a timely manner, as most of them are. The problem in this case is the timeline - Michael insisted on caring for Terri until the money from the malpractice settlement came in, at which point he tired of the game and refused to let the family take over. There is something terribly repulsive about using an extremely disabled person as a lever for financial gain, then discarding the person like garbage.\n\n Your notion that he benefitted from Terri was well debated in the previous 14 pages of this thread. It appears as though the money he recieved went into her care and attempted rehabilitation. It was only after doctors stated that there was no chance of improvement that he decided to withdrawl her life support. And even towards the end, he was offered a million dollars at least once to leave Terri alone and sign POA over to her family. It seems to me that if the man was just after money, this would have been a great time to get it. Perhaps he just felt an obligation to carry out her final wishes. I cannot say for sure, but he was in a much better position than me to know. I find it unimaginable that people can be so harsly critical of the man, when they knew neither him nor Terri before she became vegatative. Personally, I cannot blame him for moving on with his life, I would have done the same thing. But I definately would have still fought to carry out my wifes final wishes, despite what her family would say. \n \n People seemed to believe Terri's family so easily that she would want to live, but where is their credibility. After all, this is the same family that stated that Terri responded to them often, and that she had a meaningful chance of recovery. They even went as far as saying that when they pulled the feeding tube out, that Terri said \"I want to live\". (of course, did not even come public until a few days before she died). Seems to me, if Terri had actually stated this, that the family would have been shouting this from the rooftop right after it happened, and the nurse or doctor who pulled out the tube would have made a note of it. To me, it seemed like the last act of a desperate family who would say anything to \"save\" Terri. People who understood Terri's condition prior to the tube being pulled, knew that there was no way she could communicate. The autopsy report confirmed without a doubt that not only could Terri not communicate, but that Terri had no consciousness. So is it possible, just possible, that the family might have said other things that were not true in the effort to convince the courts to keep this shell of a woman alive?",

In the face of all this, saying that he just wanted her out of his misery seems really rediculous.\n\n \n He didn't have that option. While million dollar, and even multimillion dollar offers were made, he was not the one that made the deciusion. The court was. In 1998, her husband petitioned the court to essentially become her surrogate decision maker in whether she would want to live or die. The court, after hearing testimony from dozens of people hwo know her, decided that she would nto wisah to live. They used the \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard, which is the highest standard in civil cases. The ruling was essentially that there was absolutly no question whatsoever that she would nto want to live under those conditions.\n \n While he was essentially her surrogate decision maker in all other matters, the court was essentiall her guardian ad litem in the quesiton of whether or not she would wish to live under those conditions. The appeals court later ruled as well that there was \"clear and convincing\" evidence to this. Every court that ever approcahed the quesiton ruled the same.\n \n \nMy point is that while Michael may initially have been an appropriate guardian, he was certainly conflicted by the time he had moved in with his girlfriend and had two children by her. The judge disgraced himself and his profession by refusing to recognize that, and there is no credibility in an argument that relies on \"the inkstains that have dried upon some line\" (John Hartford's words).\n\n \n There was no question as to whether or not Michael should have been her guardin or not, nor would the judge, under flordia law, been allowed to make such a determination in the absence of evidence of abuse. In Florida, if you are incapacitated, your spouse is your guardian. There is no way around this, unles you petition the court to assign another guardian. In this case,there was certainly no evidence of abuse, and the corut acted as guardian ad litem in the question of whether she should live or not. \n \n I can not say for certain what kind of guardian he may have been. I do know what the secodn district court said about his care of his wife:\n \n \nTheresa has been blessed with loving parents and a loving husband. Many patients in this condition would have been abandoned by friends and family within the first year. Michael has continued to care for her and to visit her all these years. He has never divorced her. He has become a professional respiratory therapist and works in a nearby hospital. As a guardian, he has always attempted to provide optimum treatment for his wife. He has been a diligent watch guard of Theresa's care, never hesitating to annoy the nursing staff in order to assure that she receives the proper treatment.\n\n \n This is after their reviewing hundreds of hours of testimony, so frankly I am willing to take them at their word. They investigated things carefully and that is the conclusion that was drawn regarding his care for his wife. Nobody expects a man to devote the rest of his life to his already dead wife, even if she is being kept alive as a vegetable.",

What aprt of \"HE DID NOT MAKE THE DECISION\" do you not understand? If he had divorced her or petitioned the court to remove the guardianship, it would have changed NOTHING. THE COURT made the decision to allow her to die. Even if his parents had been handed guardianship, she STILL would have died, because the court had already ordered it. The original court, acting as her guardian in the matter, determined that this is what she would want, and it was upheld under multiple appeals. People seem to have this misconception that this was a battle between her husbands and her parents. That is simply incorrect, though it does immediatly show that the person in quesiton lacks even a basic grasp of the facts of the case. \n \n I personally don't understand how so many morally rightous folks out there can claim that THEY know more about the case, and what Terri would have wanted, than the court, who literally took hundreds of hours of testimony, statements from independant doctors appointed, and paid for, BY THE COURT (despite the rediculous claims that only the doctors hired by him found that she was in a PVS).\n \n \nThe court used only hearsay evidence (the only kind available) which would not be adequate to sustain a $10 fine for jaywalking.\n\n \n Do you even understand the concept of hearsay evidence? If I am on the witness stand, and I say \"My neiborgh bob told me he killed his wife\", that is not hearsay evidecne, that is eye witness testimony, which is one of the strongest types of evidence you can present in court (unless the witness is discredited, as her parents were). If I get up ont he stand and say \"fred down the street told me that bob told him that he killed his wife\", that is hearsay evidence and is inadmissable in most cases (exceptions may be made if bob killed fred as well). NO hearsay evidence was admitted in ANY of the hearings. ONE witness presented hearsay on the stand and their testimony was thrown out. \n \n \nAnd the judge made sure that no one else would be allowed to speak for her.\n\n \n Except, of course, for the 38 witnesses and 9 different doctors. The only witensses who testified that they had heard her calim that she would not want to die in such a circumstance were her parents, and their testimony was so badly discredited that if the circumstances of the case had been different (not so emotionally charged), they would probably have been charged with perjury, and rightly so.\n \n \nThe case was a tragic miscarriage of justice and set a disgraceful standard for treatment of the severely disabled.\n\n \n I am interested to hear how you drew your conclusions in this case. No disrespoect intended, I am just interested in your thought processes here. When I first heard fo the whole mess, I researched the case. I read the court findings, some fo the witness testimony, took a look ath the statements provided by the court appointed doctors, and formed an opinion. You do not seem to be in posession of ANY facts whatsoever, to the point of being clueless as to who actually made the decision, what kind of testimony and evidence was offered, or even who the major players really were as far as who was on the different sides fo the dispute. \n \n How did you form an opinion on this? You certainly seem to have not just an opinion, but an exceptionally strong opinion, yet you have clearly demonstrated that it is in no way based on the facts fo the case. Is it purely an emotional response?\n \n Again, no offense intended, just wondering.",

   "See post #194, which rebuts your arguments.\n\n \n Post 194 does not even adress my arguments, because, once again, it shows a complete ignorance of the facts in the case.\n \n Here is post 194 and my comments:\n \n \nI see three major problems with Terri's case:\n\n \n That is becuase you are completely ignorant of the facts surrounding it.\n \n \n1) Michael Schiavo should not have been the guardian. Having the spouse as guardian is a reasonable default, but it should be open to challenge. Certainly it would be unreasonable to appoint the spouse as guardian after a couple had filed for divorce, and once Michael moved on with his life - moved in with his girlfriend and started a family with her - there is not a court in the country that would have denied Terri a divorce. But Judge George Greer made certain that Terri had no one to speak for her.\n\n \n And it is opne to challenge. If there is any evidence at all that the person in quesiton is beign abused, or that they are not acting in the best intersts of their ward, the court will pull the plug. Even her parents did not argue that abuse was occuring, and the courts had already ruled that the course he was taking was what she would have wanted....they ruled that there was clear and compelling evidence for this. \n \n You seem to be arguing two opposite sides at the same time. On the one hand, you seem to be sayiung that he should have spent his life pining away for his already deaad wife. On the other you seem to be arguing that he should have essentially disowned her. You can't have it both ways. If I was ever in a similar situation, I would hope that my wife would move on with her life and be happy. At the same time, though, I would hope that she would not just disavow me.\n \n \n2) Terri's wishes: Several years after the original incident (and after the malpractice suit money came in), Michael and a couple of his relatives submitted affadavits that Terri would not have wanted to live in that condition. Several of Terri's friends submitted affadavits that, for the first few years, they had heard Michael tell people that he had no idea what Terri would have wanted. In a classic case of he said / she said, based on hearsay evidence that would not support a $10 fine for jaywalking, Judge George Greer sentenced Terri to death.\n\n \n You have not established any hearsay evidence. We already covered what constitutes hearsay. \n \n What you are missing here is the fact (yes, I know, andother pesky fact) that her prognosis changed. Up to that point, there was actually some very small hope for recovery. At that point (about 3-4 years intot he ordeal), it became apparent that her brain was actually disappearing. It was being replaced with cerebral fluid. At that point, there was ABSOLUTELY NO HOPE FOR RECOVERY. Her brain was simply diapearing. Everything that made Terri Terri was dead, and was beign absorbed by the body as dead tissue generaly is.\n \n Even if this had not changed, it makes no difference. Michaels testimony was not even pivitol to the case. It is interesting that you bring upo her friends who submitted the affidavids, since all of them but one retracted their statements before the actual trial, and the one who did not was the ONLY witness whose testimony was ruled to be hearsay and was thrown out. Apparently in her affidavid and testimony she claimed that she had heard Michael make the statement that he had no idea what terri would want. She claimed she was at a social event. Later it was shown that Micahel was not even at the event in question, and that the conversation in question never took place. She then changed her story and claimed that somebody else there had related the conversation to her. That was the only hearsay presented int he entire case.\n \n \nThe appellate courts looked only for dotted i's and crossed t's, but none of them ever reviewed the facts of the case. I can guarantee that if Terri had been sentenced on the basis of an alleged crime, the appellate courts would have fallen all over themselves to send the case back for retrial. But there was no crime.\n\n \n Wrong again. The primary purpose of appeal was the question of whether the \"clear and convincing\" burden of evidence had been obtained. Not only did they review every shred of evidence int he case, including the hudreds of hours of witness testimony, they also listened to a whole slew of witnesses present first hand testimony. This took place twice on appeal, so the entire body of evidence was weighed by 3 different courts, and a whole truckload of judges. any one fo those courts could have found differently. No judge that ever weighed the evidence saw fit to do so.\n \n \n3) The method of execution was slow and barbaric, far beyond \"cruel and unusual.\" Terri's mother was denied the opportunity to offer any comfort to her dying daughter - water for her parched lips, or a sliver of ice for her swollen tongue. What was Judge George Greer afraid of? Was he afraid she would choke to death and end her suffering too early? Or was he afraid that she wouldn't choke to death?\n\n \n Thisis just stupid. She was not executed. She was allowed to die. More to the point, since her brain was already dead, her body was allowed to catch up. If you feed her or give her water, it would have just drawn it out, making the death even longer.\n \n Her mother was not allowed to be there because frankly her family behaved like a bunch of jackasses. \n \n End her suffering too early? She was not suffering. Her brain was gone. The lights were on, but there was nobody home. There was no suffering. I would have thought the results of the autopsey would have shut the crowd that was constatnly railing about the inhumanity of her death up. She was no longer a sentient being. She was a breathing corpse.",

   "So what you are saying here, is that if he did not know about her bulemia, he could not have known about her wishes if she was incapacitated? That is rediculous. Discussing end of life issues with your spouse, and discussing your self inflicted illness with your spouse are 2 different things. People hide things like bulemia, drug addictions, gambling problems, and extramarital affairs from their spouse all the time. I see no correlation between him knowing her end of life wishes and him knowing or not knowing about her bulemia.\n\n \n If you've ever lived with a bulemic, you'd have to be blind not to know it. Trust me. I speak from experience. And if he wasn't aware of something that obvious, what else he was clueless about is open to speculation, IMO.",

There were about 50 of us there, so we got to know each other quite well. What we did not know, or even suspect, was that one of the girls who was there with us was bulemic. We did not find out until she was taken to the ER one night with an irregular heart beat. Apparently, she had been bulemic for at least 3 years prior to this night, and nobody had ever put 2 and 2 together. I'm not saying that we slept in her room with her every night, but living on one floor in a dormatory with 50 people for 10 months a year, you tend to get to know people. And when the other 40+ of us who are either trained to some level or in training in the medical field miss it, yes, I would say that there is the possibility that people can conceal their illness. \n \n Perhaps you are more observant than most people. Perhaps the clues were stronger for you. Perhaps the person you were with was not hiding it very well. etc...etc...etc... \n \n Just don't think that your one personal experience speaks for every case out there. People can and do hide eating disorders, that is a known fact.",

That's all.\n\n Again, perhaps he did not know if she had an eating disorder. The difference I see between these 2 is that his wife would be less likely to tell him about an eating disorder. A conversation about end of life issues is something most couples have at some point. I really don't see it as you must know about one to know about the other. \n \n It's kinda like my wife did not tell me about the big dent on her car until I found it 3 weeks after she did it. However, I think we talked casually many times about \"what we would or would not want\" if we were in a vegetative state. I don;t think knowing end of life issues of your spouse is really knowing your partner well, it is just a simple conversation that most often comes up. Most bulemics do not come out to their partner and tell them that they are barfing up dinner every night because they are to fat. This is usually something people go great lengths to hide. \n \n \nThat's refreshing, especially since it's still taking place daily. emoticon_frazzled\n\n Just curious, but have you sought help for this person?

I now know way more about anorexia and bulemia than I'd ever have imagined. The link to OCDs and serotonin levels in a particular portion of the brain, as seen in a PET Scan, is amazing.
