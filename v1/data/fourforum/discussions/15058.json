   "Watch the parents flock to this one! \n \n The thought, or lack thereof can start in a number of ways.\n \"Honey, I want to have a baby!\"\n \"Who will look after us when we are old?\"\n \"God commands it!\"\n \"What's contraception?\"\n \"If feels good, do it!\"\n \"Oops, we're pregnant!\"\n \n It's not always planned and it all seems innocent enough. But is your right to have children, your right to add more mouths to feed, your right to add more cars to our roads, your right to add more opinionated voices on this debating site, a reasonable choice given the world's expanding population?\n \n Now I'm not advocating China's one child policy, but I am going to question why couples feel obligated to contribute to our over populated world. \n \n Who is going to support our aging population? The children!\n Who is going to pass on my precious genes? The children!\n Who is going to advance our technology for the benefit of all? The children!\n Who is going to ensure the Earth's ultimate decay and who will pay for my lack of foresight? No, it's not a trick question.\n \n Being a former child, I do face a certain dilemma here. Furthermore, who am I to suggest that a responsible parent shouldn't indulge in a few children, given that they have an established income, will be a good role model and nurture their children's development to the benefit of society. It's not their fault that people less important and less fortunate than themselves have children willy nilly and let them run wild and eat food and increase carbon emmissions! \n \n So will the problem be someone else's until our planet reaches its limit in terms of the plant or animal life it can sustain? Or is there really a need to worry at all and can we just \"make do with what we've got!\" It has always worked in the past. \n \n How many hits to our quality of life, how many hits are we willing to let our environment take before we say, \"enough is enough.\"",
