That probably why the pdfwriter hangs up. It should be included in Acrobat. If you can't access it directly from Word, try printing your document. In the list of available printers, Acrobat Distiller ought to be among them. Use that \"printer\". It won't print, but it will save it to a file as a .pdf. \n \n Hope it works. I hope you have plenty of backups!",
