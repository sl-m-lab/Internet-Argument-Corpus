There can be local decreases in entropy as long as the system as a whole does not experience a decrease. This happens all the time, including in your body millions of times every day.\n This type of fallacious application of the second law of thermodynamics would lead us to conclude that growth and maturation are impossible, too.

Entropy would only allow it to swing down, not back up. Nothing would grow (electrolyte's example, simplified).
