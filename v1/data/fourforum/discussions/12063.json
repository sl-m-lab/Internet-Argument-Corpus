   "Evolution Fraud\n \n Piltdown man: Found in a gravel pit in Sussex England in 1912, this fossil was considered by some sources to be the second most important fossil proving the evolution of man-until it was found to be a complete forgery 41 years later. The skull was found to be of modern age. The fragments had been chemically stained to give the appearance of age, and the teeth had been filed down!\n \n \n Nebraska Man from the Illustrated London NewsNebraska man: A single tooth, discovered in Nebraska in 1922 grew an entire evolutionary link between man and monkey, until another identical tooth was found which was protruding from the jawbone of a wild pig.\n \n \n Java man: Initially discovered by Dutchman Eugene Dubois in 1891, all that was found of this claimed originator of humans was a skullcap, three teeth and a femur. The femur was found 50 feet away from the original skullcap a full year later. For almost 30 years Dubois downplayed the Wadjak skulls (two undoubtedly human skulls found very close to his \"missing link\"). (source: Hank Hanegraaff, The Face That Demonstrates The Farce Of Evolution, [Word Publishing, Nashville, 1998], pp.50-52)\n \n \n Orce man: Found in the southern Spanish town of Orce in 1982, and hailed as the oldest fossilized human remains ever found in Europe. One year later officials admitted the skull fragment was not human but probably came from a 4 month old donkey. Scientists had said the skull belonged to a 17 year old man who lived 900,000 to 1.6 million years ago, and even had very detail drawings done to represent what he would have looked like. (source: \"Skull fragment may not be human\", Knoxville News-Sentinel, 1983)\n \n \n Neanderthal: Still synonymous with brutishness, the first Neanderthal remains were found in France in 1908. Considered to be ignorant, ape-like, stooped and knuckle-dragging, much of the evidence now suggests that Neanderthal was just as human as us, and his stooped appearance was because of arthritis and rickets. Neanderthals are now recognized as skilled hunters, believers in an after-life, and even skilled surgeons, as seen in one skeleton whose withered right arm had been amputated above the elbow.

Ernst Haeckel proposed this theory in the late 1860's, promoting Darwin's theory of evolution in Germany. He made detailed drawings of the embryonic development of eight different embryos in three stages of development, to bolster his claim. His work was hailed as a great development in the understanding of human evolution. A few years later his drawings were shown to have been fabricated, and the data manufactured. He blamed the artist for the discrepancies, without admitting that he was the artist.

   "Will Christian Creationists ever stop lying about science? I don't think so. They seem pathologically incapable of speaking or even recognising truth. Since they cannot attack evolutionary science scientifically, they demonise biologists instead.\n \n It's pretty pathetic how intellectually and ethically bankrupt the Creationism movement is. I don't blame the thoughtless mouthpieces who regurgitate the stupidity emanating from Non-Think Tanks like the haplessly misnamed Discovery Institute, and other such dends of deceit. However, I do blame those who subscribe to their malicious and fraudulent campaign to destroy science. That is dangerous for all of us in the short run, because it undermines the ability of scientists do the work they are supposed to, as well as the willingness of the public to listen to scientists when making up their minds about technology and ecology.\n \n And little do the thoughtless Creationists know it, but their campaign of outrageous deceit will, in the long run, undermine and bury their religion. The avalanche of truth cannot be stayed by a flimsy fence of lies, it will out, and it will take their religion with it.",

   "If Creationists were to take their religious forefathers more seriously than they ever do, they wouldn't rely so much on lunacy and lies to bolster their feeble case:\n \n \nSaint Augustine (A.D. 354-430) in his work The Literal Meaning of Genesis (De Genesi ad litteram libri duodecim) provided excellent advice for all Christians who are faced with the task of interpreting Scripture in the light of scientific knowledge. This translation is by J. H. Taylor in Ancient Christian Writers, Newman Press, 1982, volume 41.\n Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he hold to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men. If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods and on facts which they themselves have learnt from experience and the light of reason? Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion. [1 Timothy 1.7]\n\n \n From: http://www.pibburns.com/augustin.htm\n \n Well, duh! Augustine must be spinning in his grave when he contemplates the foolishness of Creationists.",

   "That list has long been refuted by creationwiki\n\n Oooh, that's one better than Archie could do. Let's take a look at the relevant bits, then.\n \n Piltdown man (CW). This response states three things. (paraphrased, response)\n \n 1. \"Piltdown shows that hoaxes can persist for a long time\". Well, yes. However, that isn't grounds for assuming that all of the multitude of evidence pointing towards evolution is a hoax - just that all things should be looked at critically. As Piltdown Man was eventually uncovered, this shows that 'evolutionists' are (eventually) critical with their analysis.\n \n 2. \"The evolution-based mindset of everyone who looked at Piltdown meant that the hoax wasn't discovered until it had been published\". This is an unprovable claim. It is also contrary to the fact that Piltdown was not universally accepted within the scientific community (a TO claim which CW did not refute).\n \n 3. \"Creationists didn't plan the pro-creation fakes\". Again, unprovable. However, more importantly, this response reeks of hypocrisy. Some creationists seized on 'their' hoaxes to further the creationism viewpoint, just as some scientists seized on Piltdown Man to prove their theory. CW is trying to have one and deny the other, which isn't logically consistent.\n \n Nebraska Man. This response states just the one thing: \"Nebraska Man illustrates the danger of basing discoveries on such scant evidence.\" However, the TO response itself says that such a 'discovery' was not made - the whole thing was labelled as speculation in the first place and then retracted entirely and publicly on the finding of more evidence.\n \n Orce Man: Based on the response here, I don't think this is a particularly valid claim for the creationists to make. A piece of bone was found, which was originally identified (by an non-ascertainable number of people) as coming from the oldest European human found. Accordingly, a meeting was called. However, the sample was further analysed (evidence of critical analysis) and the meeting cancelled when it's authenticity was called into question.\n \n This just demonstrates the successful scientific method at work, and further refutes CW point 2 from Piltdown Man that 'the evolutionist viewpoint warps everybody's perceptions'.\n \n Lucy.\n Creationwiki's response: \"Ooops, yeah, that was our bad\"\n \n Archeoraptor. The response here was \"All Chinese fossils should be treated as fakes until otherwise proven\". However, this isn't a valid assertion to make - it's akin to saying that 'because this man is guilty of murder, all other men are not presumed guilty until proven innocent'.\n \n So... out of all of those, the only real theme that remains is 'scientists should be more critical of their findings'. Given the few number of 'hoaxes' compared to the vast majority of non-hoax fossils, etc that have been found and which also support evolution,I'd say that they are being pretty critical anyway - and also that your case from this thread is reduced to squat.\n \n Incidentally, note also that nowhere in CW's responses did they echo the claim from cashburnrate's OP that this was \"Frauds by evolutionists\".",
