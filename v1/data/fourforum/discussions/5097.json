I support abortion rights for a few reasons. One would be the ability for a woman to make her own choices regarding her health and body, and not the government. \n Second would be the fact that if a woman is made to carry a baby to term, it can not only ruin her life (school, work, etc etc), it can cause mental damage to the child, as neglect will almost certainly follow. Even if the child is given up for adoption, were he or she to find out, you have to admit that would cause some serious self-loathing. \n Finally, it is true that there are already too many people on Earth.

How can anyone not have empathy for the millions of aborted children?\n\n \n In the same way I don't have empathy for poddy calves sold for dog meat or fish caught in their thousands for human consumption.\n \n Humans are just animals. I certainly value my dog more than I value most of the people in the world..\n \n \n \nLiberalism and abortion are a stain on the very soul of this world.\n\n \n I feel the same way about narrow-minded conservatism and organised religion in general. It seems to me that devoted belief in anything as huge as a god, based on no objective, independantly verified proof is ludicrous. Sure, there might be A god, but does he operate as set out in the bible? No way, jose. Does he give a rats pyjamas about abortion? There is absolutly no proof to indicate as much.",

   "Fair enough. But on the other hand, if fair is fair, and our goal is equality, if the woman has the right to choose parenthood or not, should the man not have the same right?\n \n No, I say that since our society has taken steps to guarantee paternal responsibility, then the father should have just as much right to choose as the mother. \n\n \n I disagree. As much as society may push for paternal responsibility, it is the woman who has the actual burden of pregnancy. Responsibility post-birth is unfortunately another issue.\n \n \n Point in case scenerios:\n Wife gets pregnant. Husband wants to abort, wife doesn't. Husband has no recourse but to raise and support the child.\n \n Wife gets pregnant, she wants to abort, husband wants to have the baby and responsible. Again, the husband has no say.\n \n Girlfriend gets pregnant. Boyfriend wants to abort, girlfriend doesn't. Boyfriend will be legally responsible for the baby for 18 years minimum.\n \n It's a one sided situation. That's NOT equality. Would you not agree sir?\n\n \n I agree it is a one-sided situation. The reality, however, is that a woman has the burden of pregnancy. The actual decision is hers.\n \n However, it is my opinion that abortion is a symptom of the problem: why are there so many unwanted pregnancies in the first place? Sex-education and parenthood planning is something that this country needs to start taking seriously.\n \n Currently, how this country approaches issues regarding sexuality is appalling. That needs to change before we see an actual reduction in the number of unwanted pregnancies.",

How do you decide it is then okay to abort?\n \n Your position is illogical.\n \n \n I want to stop all abortions with the exceptions I already mentioned........\n\n \n Everything you say before the except is B.S..\n \n You need to start with raising our young boys to respect women.Teach our young girls to respect themselves. Be honest about sex: yes it does feel good, but it comes with responsibility. Yes there are emotions involved. If your going to have sex, know your partner and act responsibly. Use protection. Yes, abstaining from sex is one of the best ways to prevent pregnancy and the spread of STDs. No, there is nothing wrong with masturbation. It is just as reliable as abstaining from sex in the prevention of pregnancy & disease. Yes, you should wait until you are financially able to support a child before getting pregnant ... and so on and so on ...",

   "No offense to those who consider Abortion murder, but this fact has to be considered. In fact, the unborn fetus has the closest resemblance to a bacteria in your body. This is because all an unborn fetus is is a living thing living off of the mother, and thats what a bacteria is, except those eventually use up their welcome. (no offense to unborn children), but its the truth. Consider this, up until the sixth month of development, the unborn fetus cannot live outside the mother at all, the mother is the only thing keeping it alive, meaning that until the sixth month of development, the fetus must be considered part of the mother, just like the mother's arm. It's not considered murder to cut off your arm, although you are killing the cells in it,(you might have a bit of a run-in with health insurance), but other than that, you wont go to jail or anything, it's not condidered another living thing, although it is. So, technically and scientifically speaking, a fetus cannot be considered another human being until it can live without another human being to live on. so, after the sixth month of development then the fetus(baby) can be considered another human being because it can live from life-support equiptment. Life-support equipment cannot be considered another thing to live off of because its not another human. So, until the fetus can live by itself, it has to be considered part of what it is living off of (in this case the mother). This would be the same as, say your arm was injured badly and had to be amputated, its part of you, and is a living thing, but the doctor might have to decide to amputate it, and its not considered murder for the doctor to do that is it? The fact is, your arm is part of you because it lives off of you, it can't live by itself can it? Same thing with a fetus, it has to be considered part of you because it can't survive on its own until after the sixth month of development.",

   "No offense to those who consider Abortion murder, but this fact has to be considered. In fact, the unborn fetus has the closest resemblance to a bacteria in your body.

(no offense to unborn children), but its the truth. Consider this, up until the sixth month of development, the unborn fetus cannot live outside the mother at all, the mother is the only thing keeping it alive, meaning that until the sixth month of development, the fetus must be considered part of the mother, just like the mother's arm. It's not considered murder to cut off your arm, although you are killing the cells in it,(you might have a bit of a run-in with health insurance), but other than that, you wont go to jail or anything, it's not condidered another living thing, although it is. So, technically and scientifically speaking, a fetus cannot be considered another human being until it can live without another human being to live on. so, after the sixth month of development then the fetus(baby) can be considered another human being because it can live from life-support equiptment. Life-support equipment cannot be considered another thing to live off of because its not another human. So, until the fetus can live by itself, it has to be considered part of what it is living off of (in this case the mother).

   "*cough* Read the Bible? Only when I have to.\n \nThat's the thing though - different texts are intended to be read in different ways. Each form of literature, you could say, is a game with certain rules of participation between the author (making the story) and the potential reader (receiving the story). The Bible falls into that special category of literature called \"Theology\" or \"Moral Epistemology\" - a statement of the various objects and rules that constitute the game called \"Christian Morality\".\n \n The interesting thing about the Bible is that it is written aphoristically, rather than literally - trying to cite by a combination of exposition and example instances of good behaviour or attitudes. But what's captivating about it is its use of colloquialistic, rather than poetic, metaphors in order to get the point across. It's a religion for everyone, rather than just for priests (or academics).\n \n However as an example of deeply meditative thought, the Bible pales in comparison to Plato's Republic, the Tao-te-Ching, Kant's Metaphysics of Morals, let alone Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations. Like every other meditative-text there is, you can read too much into it. Some interpretations are better than others for very simple reasons that they are more faithful to the original structure.\n \n The accessibility of the Bible is its downfall though, as that accessibility leads to lazy thinking and so it has a tendency to promote dogmatism on issues of doctrine rather than critical discussion thanks to the ancilliary misconception that because the Bible points to Truth that it is Truth.\n",
