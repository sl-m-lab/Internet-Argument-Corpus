Otherwise, I guess I'll never know.\n \n\n When we cannot explain something religion provides the answers.\n \n\n I wish we had religion in math class. If I didn't know the answer to a problem all I'd have to do is ask religion, and then I'd know. But seriously, the religion as you're explaining it is just a tool for people to use to give themselves comfort. That is an insult to anyone who actually believes their religion is true.
