   "But we don't listen to health professionals when we're reforming health care, do we? Anymore than we listen to what the majority of Americans want!\n \n ----------------------\n \n Health Professionals Tell Congress They Want Single-Payer\n by Jeff Muskus\n \n At a long-awaited House subcommittee hearing on Wednesday, health-care professionals made it clear that they believe a single-payer system to be the best and perhaps only workable option for health care reform.\n \n \"Single-payer is the only reform that can control health care costs,\" said Walter Tsou, a University of Pennsylvania professor and an adviser to Physicians for a National Health Program. The last 50 years of government policy have protected insurance industry profits at the expense of taxpayers, doctors and hospitals, he said.\n \n \"Our most famous radical document begins with the words, 'We the People.' Not 'We the Insurers,'\" he said. \"It is time for our own generation's revolution.\"\n \n For the most part, the panelists testifying before the Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions Subcommittee agreed that spiraling costs are the greatest problem currently facing the medical community and its patients.\n \n \"Unless you can stop the insurance industry price gouging, we simply cannot make health care affordable, which means you either have price controls on the insurance industry or you take them out of the equation through single-payer reform,\" said Geri Jenkins, the co-president of the National Nurses Organizing Committee, which represents 86,000 registered nurses. \"If we were to have a debate on containing costs, improving quality and universality, the single-payer advantage would be clear.\"\n \n The discussion about a single-payer approach has been slow in coming because congressional leaders and the White House took a single-payer system off the table early in talks on health care reform. But there are signs that they regret that decision now.\n \n Rep. Rob Andrews (D-N.J.), the subcommittee chairman, said he worries that systemic inefficiencies in U.S. health care make the nation less competitive abroad. Ranking subcommittee member Rep. John Kline (R-Minn.) complained that health care is moving too quickly through Congress, noting that Wednesday's hearing was announced Thursday night, less than the customary week to 10 days he prefers to wait. But Andrews, who witnessed the failure of Clinton-era health care reform, responded, \"it's not being done nearly quickly enough.\"\n \n Fifteen years after the Clinton plan collapsed, the U.S. remains far behind other industrialized nations on health care, Judiciary Committee chair John Conyers (D-Mich.) told the subcommittee. Conyers said he has \"a plan of a plan\" for a \"uniquely American\" single-payer program that in its current form requires 3.5 percent of a taxpayer's income.\n \n \"This is the most popular system in the minds of most Americans,\" he said of single-payer generally, citing polls and constituents' calls to his office. \"If you take the most popular health care option and take it off the table, heaven knows what you're left with.\"\n \n Four of the five panelists, including Conyers, spoke in favor of single-payer. The only person in opposition was Manhattan Institute fellow David Gratzer, a doctor born and trained in Canada, who said the Canadian national-health system struggles to provide care to its citizens. \"Like the Soviet Union, everything is free, nothing is available,\" Gratzer said.\n \n But as long as Congress adequately funds health care, the other panelists said, that won't be an issue. \"If they were to put the same amount of money into their systems as we do into ours, there would be no waits,\" said Marcia Angell, a Harvard lecturer and former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n \n \"The reason our health care system is in such trouble is that it's set up to generate profits, not to provide care,\" Angell said, noting that private insurers spend 20 percent on marketing and administrative costs, compared with 3 percent for Medicare. She deemed the health-insurance sector \"an industry that offers almost nothing of value.\"\n \n Most of the panelists dismissed concerns of job losses at private insurers, arguing that employment would increase overall given the increased demand for medical professionals. Jenkins estimated total job creation at 2.6 million.\n \n Some subcommittee Republicans seemed insulted by the very idea that the U.S. health care system needs reform. \"I've been struck by the testimony about how awful the quality of American health care is,\" Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), who is a doctor, said. U.S. care, Price said, is second \"almost to none.\"\n \n Poor U.S. health outcomes, Gratzer argued, are a function simply of poor U.S. lifestyle choices, like smoking, drinking, overeating and murdering. If you remove murders and accidental deaths from U.S. deaths per year, he said, the \"crude statistics\" become less compelling.\n \n Andrews seemed impatient with Gratzer's responses, especially when he argued that more time spent \"hanging out with the family doctor\" could improve individual health.\n \n Andrews and full committee chair Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) are scheduled to discuss a single-payer system with the House Ways and Means Committee later Wednesday, and the subcommittee chair noted the presence of Ways and Means member Pete Stark at the hearing. \"This is the beginning of the process, not the end,\" Andrews said.\n \n Health Professionals Tell Congress They Want Single-Payer | CommonDreams.org\n \n -----------------",

Here is an article that discusses the study, including the sample and numbers the sample should represent:\n \n ------------\n \n WASHINGTON, March 31 (Reuters) - More than half of U.S. doctors now favor switching to a national health care plan and fewer than a third oppose the idea, according to a survey published on Monday.\n \n The survey suggests that opinions have changed substantially since the last survey in 2002 and as the country debates serious changes to the health care system.\n \n Of more than 2,000 doctors surveyed, 59 percent said they support legislation to establish a national health insurance program, while 32 percent said they opposed it, researchers reported in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.\n \n The 2002 survey found that 49 percent of physicians supported national health insurance and 40 percent opposed it.\n \n \"Many claim to speak for physicians and represent their views. We asked doctors directly and found that, contrary to conventional wisdom, most doctors support national health insurance,\" said Dr. Aaron Carroll of the Indiana University School of Medicine, who led the study.\n \n \"As doctors, we find that our patients suffer because of increasing deductibles, co-payments, and restrictions on patient care,\" said Dr. Ronald Ackermann, who worked on the study with Carroll. \"More and more, physicians are turning to national health insurance as a solution to this problem.\"\n \n PATCHWORK\n \n The United States has no single organized health care system. Instead it relies on a patchwork of insurance provided by the federal and state governments to the elderly, poor, disabled and to some children, along with private insurance and employer-sponsored plans.\n \n Many other countries have national plans, including Britain, France and Canada, and several studies have shown the United States spends more per capita on health care, without achieving better results for patients.\n \n An estimated 47 million people have no insurance coverage at all, meaning they must pay out of their pockets for health care or skip it.\n \n Contenders in the election for president in November all have proposed various changes, but none of the major party candidates has called for a fully national health plan.\n \n Insurance companies, retailers and other employers have joined forces with unions and other interest groups to propose their own plans.\n \n \"Across the board, more physicians feel that our fragmented and for-profit insurance system is obstructing good patient care, and a majority now support national insurance as the remedy,\" Ackermann said in a statement.\n \n The Indiana survey found that 83 percent of psychiatrists, 69 percent of emergency medicine specialists, 65 percent of pediatricians, 64 percent of internists, 60 percent of family physicians and 55 percent of general surgeons favor a national health insurance plan.\n \n The researchers said they believe the survey was representative of the 800,000 U.S. medical doctors. (Reporting by Maggie Fox; Editing by Will Dunham and Xavier Briand)\n \n US doctors support universal health care - survey | Reuters\n --------------\n \n \nHow many people were in the AP poll? It sounds like a multiple choice poll, unless you think 65% of the people had the exact same quote.\n\n \n Well, I'll let you google that one yourself. But the study has been replicated a number of times, with results even higher, depending on which state. So it is widely accepted as representative of the American public's opinion, even by the A.M.A., whether or not they agree.\n \n Considering what single payer advocates have been up against, good ol' Harry and Louise and All That, they've had to check and recheck their figures before using them. Unlike the people who brought you Harry And Louise.\n \n \nIn my personal life, I have met very few people in the health care profession that support national health care.

So what?\n\n \n So you don't put any faith in statistical data (at least, when it consistently supports single payer), and personal experience is relevant when it supports your opinion, but \"so what?\" when it doesn't.\n \n Right.\n \n As for cardiology, I understand that portion of the medical profession is fairly well fleeced, now suffering from a painful pay drop of 1.3% to roughly 1/2 million per year. That most support a universal system through mandated insurance payments.\n \n Mandated insurance payments like the plan proposed by Hillary Clinton and John Edwards.

   "Btw, I think this was already posted on another thread, but here is an article with a breakdown of the American public support figures by Dems, Ind.'s, Rep.'s. \n \n ------------------------\n \n Who Prefers A Public Health Insurance Option?\n \n By Monica Sanchez\n March 18th, 2009 - 7:45pm ET\n \n For all the false alarm ringing over \"socialized medicine\" when a choice of public health insurance is discussed, little is said about the tens of millions of people in the United States who are currently-happily-getting their health care through a public health plan of one kind or another, and the tens of millions more who want to have that choice available to them.\n \n That fact was highlighted this week by stories about how veterans are reacting to the Obama administration's proposal to require veterans who have private health insurance, have their insurance cover their treatment for combat- and service-related injuries.\n \n This headline speaks volumes: \"Veterans blast Obama plan to cover injuries via private insurance.\" [see additional link below, Arizona Daily Star article] Veterans want the public health coverage to which they are entitled! In fact, they want the socialized medicine to which they are accustomed.\n \n Health services provided by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) are truly socialized medicine, because the doctors and other health care providers who serve veterans work for the government and the government owns and runs the hospitals and other health care facilities where veterans get treatment. The VHA treats over 5 million veterans a year. (PDF)\n \n It may surprise you to know that in the U.S. members of Congress and Presidents have a long history of also enjoying the socialized medicine taxpayers provide for them. In fact, members of Congress have the choice many of them want to deny you. They can choose a private health insurance plan through the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program or they can get top-notch medical care at government facilities, like the Bethesda Naval Medical Center in Maryland.\n \n Many regularly choose the public option. For example:\n \n When John McCain (R-AZ) found a discolored blotch on his left temple he headed to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda to have the spot checked out.\n \n Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) had his heart bypass surgery at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda.\n Former Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC) went to Bethesda Naval Medical Center in Maryland complaining of fatigue and subsequently got a new heart valve there.\n \n U.S. Presidents also have a long history of using the socialized medicine provided to them by taxpayers, including George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan.\n \n But the socialized medicine veterans, members of Congress and U.S. Presidents enjoy is not what Barack Obama is proposing when he includes a choice of public health insurance in his health reform plan. The public health insurance plan being discussed as part of national health reform would work more like Medicare, in which the government runs the insurance coverage, but the doctors, hospitals and other health care providers people go to are the same private, independent providers that currently care for them.\n \n In fact, people with Medicare currently have the choice of public health insurance or private plans that contract with Medicare. About eighty percent of the 44.8 million older and disabled Americans who have Medicare coverage-about 35.4 million people-choose the government-run public plan over the private Medicare plans.\n \n It is the choice 73 percent of voters want, including Democrats (77 percent), Independents (79 percent), and Republicans (63 percent). They want this choice because:\n \n 61 percent think a public health insurance plan will be better able to control health care costs by using its purchasing power to drive competition. Only 25 percent believe a public health insurance plan will shift higher costs onto the privately insured.\n 61 percent agree that millions of people are already losing their coverage every year, and a choice of private or public health insurance plans will make sure that Americans always have quality, affordable care. Only 27 percent believe the claim that a public health insurance plan will cause millions of people to be dumped from their private coverage.\n \n 66 percent agree that a public health insurance plan will provide a choice with a standard, comprehensive package of benefits and a wide choice of doctors. Only 26 percent believe a public health insurance plan will force people into lower quality care including rationing and long waits.\n \n It's time we all had the choice of public health insurance!\n \n Who Prefers a Public Health Insurance Option? | OurFuture.org\n \n -------------------",

   "Who are the people who happily pay twice as much for a 37th-rate service?\n \n Do you honestly believe that doctors are unaware of the costs of their prescribed treatments?\nI don't see how awareness of costs plays a role in determining how health care costs insurance should work. Symbiote is right. I worked at a fast food place many years ago and I knew the cost of EVERY product. Many people don't. Likewise, my doctor had no idea what the cost of the medicine I received was (granted this was a few months ago). I've audited a few hospitals...they have machines worth $250,000+ sitting in a corner because no one knows how to use them. These guys have no idea what things cost because that isn't their job. If they do, so much the better. \n \n In any event, it is totally unrelated. Being a doctor doesn't make you an expert on the financing of health care. Being a doctor means you know how to treat sick people.",

I don't understand how you can possibly believe the government will be able to run things more efficiently at less cost and PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL OR BETTER CARE.\n\n \n By looking at other countries that already manage it? Almost every country in western Europe has some form of nationalised healthcare system, and they provide equal or better care than the US. For starters they provide care to everyone. The costs of the UK NHS are barely half that of the US, yet it covers everyone. My wife is getting physiotherapy for a back problem on the NHS, I can see a doctor out of hours, my Dad gets a very expensive treatment for a neurological condition and it doesn't cost us any extra. We pay a little extra tax (around 9p in every pound, on average, compared with the 15-20 cents in every dollar that healthcare costs in the US) but the only things I have to pay for are a flat fee for prescription drugs, but that is likely to be abolished and in any case never exceeds GBP90 a year.",

   "I am a healthcare provider who has taken care of hundreds of medicare patients. A few years ago Repubicans called themselves reforming medicare - believe they did a bad job. A public option is not socialism, it is humane. We spend billions on fighting wars but are unable to invest in our future soliders and doctors. As far as the so called death panels ask any cancer patient how many times did they have to question, call their carrier to pay for their treatment. Insurance companies have panels, they are called Medical review boards. Someone who has never met you gets to decide what treatment is radical, too radical for them to pay. Many Americans work but are unable to pay for healthcare due to premiums being to high but what about the ones who have it but can't afford the the costs not covered? I'm saddened that a public option is being railroaded without options for everyone who will take care of us when we become seniors?",
