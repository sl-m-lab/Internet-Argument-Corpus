   "OAKLAND, Calif., Sept. 2 /PRNewswire/ -- More than one of every five requests for medical claims for insured patients, even when recommended by a patient's physician, are rejected by California's largest private insurers, amounting to very real death panels in practice daily in the nation's biggest state, according to data released today by the California Nurses Association/National Nurses Organizing Committee.\n \n CNA/NNOC researchers analyzed data reported by the insurers to the California Department of Managed Care. From 2002 through June 30, 2009, the six largest insurers operating in California rejected 31.2 million claims for care - 21 percent of all claims.\n \n The data will be presented by Don DeMoro, director of CNA/NNOC's research arm, the Institute for Health and Socio-Economic Policy, at CNA/NNOC's biennial convention next Tuesday, Sept. 8 in San Francisco. The convention will also feature a panel presentation from nurse leaders in Canada, Great Britain, and Australia exploding the myths about their national healthcare systems.\n \n \"With all the dishonest claims made by some politicians about alleged 'death panels' in proposed national legislation, the reality for patients today is a daily, cold-hearted rejection of desperately needed medical care by the nation's biggest and wealthiest insurance companies simply because they don't want to pay for it,\" said Deborah Burger, RN, CNA/NNOC co-president.\n \n For the first half of 2009, as the national debate over healthcare reform was escalating, the rejection rates are even more striking.\n \n PacifiCare denied 40 percent of all California claims in the first six months of 2009. Cigna, which gained notoriety two years ago for denying a liver transplant to 17-year-old Nataline Sarkisyan of Northridge, Calif. and then reversing itself, tragically too late to save her life, was still rejecting one-third of all claims for the first half of 2009.\n \n \"Every claim that is denied represents a real patient enduring pain and suffering. Every denial has real, sometimes fatal consequences,\" said Burger.\n \n PacifiCare, for example, denied a special procedure for treatment of bone cancer for Nick Colombo, a 17-year-old teen from Placentia, Calif. Again, after protests organized by Nick's family and friends, CNA/NNOC, and netroots activists, PacifiCare reversed its decision. But like Nataline Sarkisyan, the delay resulted in critical time lost, and Nick ultimately died. \"This was his last effort and the procedure had worked before with people in Nick's situation,\" said his older brother Ricky.\n \n California Blues rejected 28 percent of claims in the first half of 2009. In 2008, six days before RN Kim Kutcher of Dana Point, Calif., was scheduled to have special back surgery, Blue Cross denied authorization for the procedure as \"investigational\" even though the lumbar artificial disc she was to receive had FDA approval.\n \n At the time of denial, which she calls \"insurance hell,\" Kutcher notes she had \"already gone through pre-op testing, donated a unit of blood, had appointments with four physicians.\" Kutcher paid $60,000 out of pocket for the operation and is still fighting Blue Cross.\n \n Kaiser Permanente, which denied 28 percent of all claims in the first half of 2009, was one of two systems to reject options for radiation and chemotherapy for 57-year-old Bob Scott of Sacramento after his diagnosis of a brain tumor in 2005. The reason cited was his age, says wife Cheryl Scott, RN. \"He had been in perfect health all of his life. This was his first problem other than a sprained ankle. He died six months later.\"\n \n Rejection of care is a very lucrative business for the insurance giants. The top 18 insurance giants racked up $15.9 billion in profits last year. \n\n California's Real Death Panels: Insurers Deny 21% of Claims | Reuters\n \n Welcome to the current \"rationing\" in America... emoticon_xgood",

   "This is a very big problem isnt it...\n \n from...... Mosheh Thezion's Exploratory Committee for U.S. Senate (R) | HEALTH CARE\n \n \n \n Health care : We all know the problem, and the issue of corporate for-profit interests in health care, and how they provide less care to make a profit.\n \n Proposed solutions for Health care : \n \n \n There are bascially as I see it two options, the first of which is to establish a mandate, where by all businesses must provide healthcare benefits without exception, and where the unemployed would be covered under a public option through the E.D.D. service plan I propose, found here...=< BENEFITS FOR THE PEOPLE : JOBS\n In this way, all would be covered, as well as provided work, and yet with this the Health insurance industry must accept various levels of government regulation, where by coverage cannot be denied, and also service cannot be denied, and that all decisions regarding the provision of care is to be decided by doctors and their patients, and in exchange certain price control limits should be imposed on the hospitals themselves whom attempt to charge as much as possible in the present for profit system, AND if both HMO's and hospitals expect to continue with a for profit model, then they must accept levels of regulation so as to reduce costs, and free up this system from its entrenched problems. (This regulation being provided by an amendment to the Constitution once it is restored as law!)\n \n The second option would be to support HR 676, and expand Medicare to provide universal health care to all, and do so, via amendment. Because while the free market should have freedom in almost all circumstances, the history shows that for profit interests are simply failing to provide the care our nations people need, and service should never be denied.. NEVER! (in both options) (Except for ASSISTED SUICIDE, and ABORTION, which does not promote and save life! And since abortion is so cheap, there is no justification for making tax payers pay for it, since that burden belongs to the father and the mother. However, tax payers could pay for the 'birth' of a child, which can be very expensive.)\n Such that, under any for profit HMO option, or E.D.D. public option, or Medicare option, the law should state clearly, that any and all care advised by a doctor, must be provided, and no limits or care determinations made by any corporate, or government agency or office be allowed whatsoever, regardless of age, illness, or risk of cost. AND IF THIS IS DONE, IT WILL END THE FEARS EXPRESSED BY MOST REPUBLICANS, and fix whats wrong with the Health care corporations.\n b) ALSO, in doing so, in any option, the freedom to choose which physician one sees should be maintained, AND YET, ALSO nothing should be able to prevent the provision of service to the poor, and as such, the number of hospitals and nurses must be increased so as to meet the existing demand of the populace, with real quality. (As mandated by regulation)\n \n \n c) The real issue and challenge is that most hospitals today, are operated as for profit businesses, with investors, and stock holders, and as such, all new hospitals constructed, should be non-profit organizations, and existing hospitals can be either bought out by the government, or, regulated to the point of establishing price controls on the service they provide, in this way, there is a limit to the charge they can make to the government for the service, yet they are as such directly encouraged to provide as much service as possible. And the service which is provided should be decided by the doctors, with no bureaucratic oversight, so as to provide the best care, with an emphasis on testing, testing, testing, as the key to prevention. As well as offering assistance systems to get the people to eat better, to exercise, and most importantly, TO LOSE WEIGHT!\n In this way a hospitals bottom line as a business increases by the provision of more and better care, specifically as testing, and that hospitals which can show records of success in healing and prevention via testing and offering services, should be given a reduced tax, as an incentive. YET ALSO, HOSPITAL STAYS, SHOULD NOT COST SO MUCH AS IT DOES TODAY!\n \n d) Some say we can not afford a Universal Health care option, and I say to them, that if you have health care now that you are paying not only for the care, but for the profit margin to the insurance corporations, and as such, the increases in taxes to Medicare, is likely to be less than what you are paying now, and as such, you would never be denied service, which occurs daily with for profit health care systems. (If this Universal option is adopted!)\n Also, if we revamp the Federal Reserve, to become a non-profit, owned by our government, that the debt payments saving of 100 billion Dollars a year, would more than pay for ALL health care, and then some. (NO NEED TO RAISE TAXES!!!!)\n See..: CURRENCY : THE MONEY SYSTEM\n \n e) And in the interest of being fair, If ever the Universal option is adopted, I would think it is acceptable for the Federal government to buy out all the HMO'S stock holders, and be done with the problem, without causing them to suffer too great a loss. (a SEMI- fair price for all their stock.)\n \n \n f) Also, by implemeting my proposals for expanding the E.D.D, Employment Development Department, the abundant workers of the HMO'S, will not be left without assistance and benefits, as their industry is taken apart. \n See...< BENEFITS FOR THE PEOPLE : JOBS\n \n \n This addresses the core fears of the Republicans, and assures that Obama's and the DNC's criminal proposal of cost analysis, is completely prevented, and has no effect on the care that is given, and all those decisions OF GIVING CARE are made by the patient and their doctor ONLY!!!!\n \n We spend right now, over 500 Billion Dollars a year on our military, so that they can defend our people, therefore there is no excuse for not spending 100 Billion a year to protect the lives and health of the American people which that military serves to protect.\n \n There is no excuse. And while we need not implement complete Universal Health care, we must enforce by regulation as law, that the Health insurance corporations, cannot deny service or care to anyone, regardless of age, or estmimated worth or potential length of life. And we can make that public option available as a security blanket for people who lose their jobs, via the E.D.D. as described. In this way, we fix the problem without taking away the private health care presently provided.\n \n People are what matters.\n \n -Mosheh Thezion",

   "California's Real Death Panels: Insurers Deny 21% of Claims | Reuters\n \n Welcome to the current \"rationing\" in America... emoticon_xgood\n\n \n Frankly, it's downright disingenuous for people to constantly be restating examples of the problem of the need for healthcare reform, when the reason so many people are rejecting Obamacare is because of the WAY it goes about doing it. \n I don't think anyone would disagree that the above example is a problem. But it's sort of like jumping into a debate about how to help high gas prices by saying over and over again that gas prices are too high. EVERYONE knows that already. It's not the fact that healthcare reform needs reform that is being questioned--it's the WAY the government wants to do it. it's a case of an evil being solved by a worse evil. But big government sets itself up as an alternative via public option in a time when we're least able to financially afford it since the depression, it's not an option in a country that puts so much value on personal responsibility and freedom FROM government. \n They're pulling the same junk they did by effectively taking over GM--using government control to \"fix\" a situation rather than helping the market do what it needs to do to fix itself.\n And that's one reason why the public option is failing. People are sick of that approach.",

   "I thought this op ed piece did a pretty good job of summarizing the problems with Obamacare and why it has sort of turned into Obama's and the DNC congress' milstone-around-their-neck ...\n \"HR 3200 and its progeny are disasters. It seems that everyone except the far left agrees on this. In this article, I will analyze issues that I feel are wrong with those bills and why almost the entire populace is rallying against them. \n \n To begin with, the public option has to go. All moderates and conservatives agree. It is bad public policy and it is bad for America. The minute you put the public option into play, all private insurance companies will be driven out of business and we will have socialized health care which is the goal of the far left anyway. Once we have socialized health care, the parade of horribles begins. This includes rationing of health care, lack of choice and skyrocketing taxes. \n \n However, if you regulate the current insurance industry, you will promote competition in the private sector and drive down prices. This is the whole theory behind the anti-trust laws in the United States. (By the way, regulation, however bad it is for the free market is better than the alternative). The more competitive the private sector becomes, the lower the cost of health insurance will be. Further, if you compel the entire population to become insured either through better tax credits for individuals and/or employers, regular market forces will naturally drive down the cost of insurance. \n \n Secondly, abortion must be specifically excluded from any proposed legislation. The general public must not be forced to fund an elective procedure. Say what you will about your stance on abortion, but it is an elective procedure unless the health of the mother is in jeopardy. Then, it is a medical necessity and it is a whole different ball game.\"Read more at Big Hollywood Blog Archive Why Can?t Conservatives Sign On to ObamaCare?",

'Cause you've REALLY been in partisan-shill generalization mode lately.\n I have no doubt that if left-wing Democrats get their way, they'll make absolutely no efforts of putting protections in place against big govt. intrusion into the private sector to guard against socialism.\n\n That's really amusing.\n I point out what Republicans are pushing for, and YOU IGNORE THE ISSUE.\n \n If it's so established, WHY did the Republicans do absolutely nothing about it in their six years in power???\n \n This problem you claim is \"long been established\" has existed for a long time now. Look at what happened after Republicans stalled Clinton's health-care efforts.\n ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.\n \n You are not even bothering to address the issue.\n Instead, you call me names (yeah. I noticed that emoticon_rolleyes ) and you try to talk about the Democrats instead...\n \n \n \nThe polls make clear it's a CHOICE of public option they are talking about. One reason they're up in arms is because there aren't enough guarantees it will STAY at the level of a choice, as well as not enough protections against competition being damaged in the private sector.\n\n 1) I didn't include the word \"choice\" in my original phrasing but you are 100% accurate in that the word \"choice\" is of incredibly high importance.\n Now that we are on the same page with that, let's move on.\n \n 2) You're bluffing again...\n Explain HOW the existing program does not provide \"enough guarantees it will STAY at the level of choice\".\n QUOTING the actual legislation, SHOW ME WHERE there is any possibility that it could have the \"choice\" for the public option removed...\n \n You can't do it.\n You are AGAIN resorting to fears, and we both know that when you do that you don't check to see if the fear is real first.\n \n \n \n IOW, they want it done right. Until those issues are resolved (among others) this issue is a losing-seat issue for Democrats. And they know it.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n You really don't see what's going on with the big picture, do you.\n The polls continue to show something that demonstrates how small the \"Ooohhh... We're afraid of Obama-care\" movement truly is.\n The opinion polls show that Obama has a break-even opinion rating. Possibly slipped below since the last time I saw it.\n Congressional Democrats? Low. Badly low.\n But Congressional Republicans? LOWER THAN THAT.\n Still bottom of the barrel.\n \n These antics from the Republicans to scare up fear are appealing to their EXISTING base.\n But it isn't creating any NEW base for them.\n And it isn't the Democrats who are blocking this issue... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nDude. The whole current healthcare debate is about Obamacare.\n\n Read the above topic.\n That is what THIS thread is about.\n There are TONS of threads out there talking about Obama's healthcare plan.\n For the life of me, I don't know why you don't just go bug one of them if THAT is what you want to talk about.\n Stop trying to change the topics of existing threads.",

The very application of it is not condemned, but it just needs to be fixed.\n By the same token, do you think the same about Medicare?\n Or are you going to try to use your perspective of \"6.8%\" as an excuse to insist that Medicare's very concept is invalid?\nSeeing a national average of denial rates doesn't tell me much.

Person A needs a growth on his arm removed to perform his duties at work. The federal government did not collect what it thought they would and can't afford to pay for the surgery thus denying Person A the surgery. This would be having a finite amount of resources divided among those who need it where supply doesn't equal demand. This is also known as rationing. \n \n There is nothing to suggest this absolutely would happen if we had a government system by the way but it certainly has a better chance than a private business.

So that the insurance companies (and those politicians who receive money from the insurance companies) won't just turn around and give some undocumented spin and proclaim it's all okay, when the article WAS FILLED WITH EXAMPLES of how it was NOT okay.\n \n Steeeeve?\n Did you even bother to THINK about the numbers being thrown out there???\n The article claimed SIX insurance companies were examined.\n But only four or five of those companies were quoted in the article...\n Let's look at ALL the numbers that were reported in that study...\n \n # Aetna denied 6.5% of claims; \n # Anthem Blue Cross denied 28% of claims;\n # Kaiser Permanente denied 28% of claims;\n # Health Net denied 30% of claims\n # CIGNA denied 32.7% of claims; and\n # PacifiCare denied 39.6% of claims\n \n Steeeeve?\n Why is it that Aetna ONLY DENIED 6.5%, and KP denied OVER FOUR TIMES that???\n Kaiser CLAIMS it's all about \"duplicates, incomplete information, errors, other reasons\".\n But comparing Kaiser to another company WITHIN THE SAME STATE (cause I know you're a stickler for trying to make that standard important), KP is FOUR TIMES MORE than the best.\n Is it because Aetna's people filing the claims are just that much better where they don't send in duplicates or file incomplete information?\n \n Why is that Steeeeve?\n WHY is Aetna so much better??? emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nWhile I'm not one to just take Kaiser's word for it, it certainly seems more accurate given the website below which has been tracking this for awhile:\n PayerView :: Healthcare Payer Performance \n\n ROFLMAO!\n After taking a glance at the web-site, I had to leave the computer for a while cause I was just DYING LAUGHING...\n \n That thing Steeeeve was talking about where you supposedly cannot compare STATISTICS across state lines?\n THIS WEB-SITE DOES EXACTLY THAT!!!\n emoticon_xgood\n \n And now to possibly add insult to injury...\n Steeeeve, you claim the above web-site helps vouch Kaiser's claim.\n Kindly show me WHERE Kaiser is listed on this web-site.\n I clicked for showing \"Western Payers\" and \"Denial Rate\", and I don't see Kaiser's name on the list.\n \n YOU CLAIMED that the above web-site helped validate Kaiser's claims.\n Where?\n \n I even did a google search trying to find Kaiser Permanente mentioned on that web-site.\n NO hits.\n http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS302US303&q=site%3Awww.athenahealth.com+Kaiser+permanente&aq=f&oq=&aqi=\n \n If it's an issue of using a different pseudonym then just let me know.\n But if it's a case where this web-site doesn't even mention the company you claim this web-site supposedly validates?\n emoticon_emb\n \n \n \nI've also reviewed hospitals accounts receivable systems before and it is almost always the case that the health insurance company is denying based upon lack of information. A royal pain from what I was told and it doesn't seem to be any better whether it be BCBS or medicare. \n\n Look above.\n The original study I quoted has Aetna with ONE-QUARTER the denial rate.\n Why is that Steeeeve?",

   "It seems odd that you think a company that compiles data for insurance companies has biased data but when companies supply information that the LA Times looks at than it is fine. Did you ever stop and think about how the LA Times conducted the study? Did they hack into the companies databases and come up with these numbers on their own or did they use the numbers required by law to be reported? I'm guessing the later and the LA Times states this as well. So the AMA and PayerView are using company supplied data and I bet the LA Times is too (or that nurses association). \n \n As for MassHealth, I was suspicious when I first came across the number. Turns out the other numbers are inline with PayerView so it works out fine...in fact, it states the source as AthenaHealth. \n \n So in the end, you really have no claims...insurance companies are not \"death panels\" as the thread title suggests.

   "Here are the words of a FORMER HEALTH-INSURANCE INDUSTRY EXECUTIVE who has observed and helped form the type of vile practices that insurance companies use today to turn people's illness from expenditures into retained profits / money.\n \n A man who was a PART OF THE SYSTEM ADMITTING what I have been talking about...\n \n This is NOT because of \"government regulation\".\n \"Government regulation\" is what gives the consumer a RECOURSE after the insurance company attempts to improperly deny service.\n \n \nOpponents suggest that a \"government takeover\" of health care will be a milestone on the road to \"socialized medicine,\" and when he hears those terms, Wendell Potter cringes. He's embarrassed that opponents are using a playbook that he helped devise.\n \n \"Over the years I helped craft this messaging and deliver it,\" he noted.\n \n Mr. Potter was an executive in the health-insurance industry for nearly 20 years before his conscience got the better of him. He served as head of corporate communications for Humana and then for Cigna.\n \n He flew in corporate jets to industry meetings to plan how to block health reform, he says. He rode in limousines to confabs to concoct messaging to scare the public about reform. But in his heart, he began to have doubts as the business model for insurance evolved in recent years from spreading risk to dumping the risky.\n \n Then in 2007 Mr. Potter attended a premiere of \"Sicko,\" Michael Moore's excoriating film about the American health-care system. Mr. Potter was taking notes so that he could prepare a propaganda counterblast -- but he found himself agreeing with a great deal of the film.\n \n A month later, Mr. Potter was back home in Tennessee, visiting his parents, and dropped in on a three-day charity program at a county fairgrounds to provide medical care for patients who could not afford doctors. Long lines of people were waiting in the rain, and patients were being examined and treated in public in stalls intended for livestock.\n \n \"It was a life-changing event to witness that,\" he remembered. Increasingly, he found himself despising himself for helping block health reforms. \"It sounds hokey, but I would look in the mirror and think, how did I get into this?\"\n \n Mr. Potter loved his office, his executive salary, his bonus, his stock options. \"How can I walk away from a job that pays me so well?\" he wondered. But at the age of 56, he announced his retirement and left Cigna last year.\n \n This year, he went public with his concerns, testifying before a Senate committee investigating the insurance industry.\n \n \"I knew that once I did that my life would be different,\" he said. \"I wouldn't be getting any more calls from recruiters for the health industry. It was the scariest thing I have done in my life. But it was the right thing to do.\"\n \n Mr. Potter says he liked his colleagues and bosses in the insurance industry, and respected them. They are not evil. But he adds that they are removed from the consequences of their decisions, as he was, and are obsessed with sustaining the company's stock price -- which means paying fewer medical bills.\n \n One way to do that is to deny requests for expensive procedures. A second is \"rescission\" -- seizing upon a technicality to cancel the policy of someone who has been paying premiums and finally gets cancer or some other expensive disease. A congressional investigation into rescission found that three insurers, including Blue Cross of California, used this technique to cancel more than 20,000 policies over five years, saving the companies $300 million in claims.\n \n As the Los Angeles Times has reported, insurers encourage this approach through performance evaluations. One Blue Cross employee earned a perfect evaluation score after dropping thousands of policyholders who faced nearly $10 million in medical expenses.\n \n Mr. Potter notes that a third tactic is for insurers to raise premiums for a small business astronomically after an employee is found to have an illness that will be very expensive to treat. That forces the business to drop coverage for all its employees or go elsewhere.\n \n All this is monstrous, and it negates the entire point of insurance, which is to spread risk.\n\n Read more: Nicholas D. Kristof / Health care fit for animals: Some Americans get medical attention in livestock pens\n \n Steeeeve, as you claim to be a Christian, I don't know how you can turn a deaf ear to this.",

I can't imagine anyone buying the \"biased\" argument again Athena considering it would be a fraud to report incorrect data which is required to be submitted and used by the study you provided.\n\n \"fraud\"?\n That's funny, because the same argument could be said of my statistics.\n If THEY are supposedly invalid, then obviously THEY are committing fraud, right?\n The insurance companies COULD conceivably sue the organization for slander / libel / defamation, if they were actually invalid...\n Can you show me where they have filed the lawsuit?\n emoticon_frazzled\n \n You really don't think through these menial responses you put out there, do you...\n \n And BTW, have you ever gotten around to admitting you made up that CA-Medicare \"over 20%\" value you said you got from the PayerView web-site?\n I pointed to two separate obvious CA-Medicare values, both clearly below 20%. I challenged you to show WHERE that web-site ever claimed it was above 20%.\n Of course, you couldn't do that.\n \n \n \nAnyway, just tell me the point of this thread when you started it and we can move on with that...at the very least it will clear it up for those who don't want to read every page.\n\n Steeeeve, I have repeatedly pointed out the point of this thread.\n You continue to ignore it.\n I don't know what you think to achieve by such antics, but in the end it only diminishes your own credibility when you act like this...\n \n Perhaps you would like to clear up that claim of yours regarding \"death threats\" in the other thread?\n I asked you if you were claiming that you had actually received death threats, and then you cowardly disappeared...\n \n At this stage, I have documented by the statistics AND BY AN EX-CEO TESTIMONY the vile actions of the healthcare insurance companies to deny claims to achieve profit.\n Your only response is to parrot that you don't understand what my point is.",

   "Finally we got a point...albeit one I already easily refuted.\n \n So insurance companies are denying in order to increase profits. In order to make such a claim you would have to first provide proof of the denial claims and second show the denials are invalid and third show the denial claims are higher than the non-profit insurance (medicaid/medicare). \n \n Your proof for number one is a study printed in the LA Times conducted by 2 nurses associations using insurance company supplied data that is legally required to be submitted, in this case, to the state of California. I've refuted this with two websites (Athena PayerView and the AMA) which use the same data and provide data for the entire country, not just one state. One good example is Pacificare which is 4.5% on PayerView and 39.6% from the LA Times article. One of those is obviously wrong. You'd like to claim PayerView is \"in bed\" with the insurance companies so therefore we shouldn't trust them but this claim holds no wait. The AMA publishes this data as well and is remarkably close to the PayerView numbers. For example PayerView denial rates for Medicare on a national level is 8.5% while on the AMA site it is close to 7%. Aetna is 5.9% on the PayerView site and 6.8% on the AMA site (2008 numbers). Overall PayerView shows HIGHER numbers than the AMA. This makes sense because PayerView uses lines reworked and flat out denied while the AMA just looks at denied. So to conclude with objective one (that I claim you have to prove), the denial rates are significantly less than what the LA Times says in the article.\n Sources:\n PayerView :: Healthcare Payer Performance\n http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/368/reportcard-short.pdf\n \n Second, you needed to show where the denials are invalid. The LA Times are article gives some examples of denials and I'm going to assume the denials were invalid even when the article doesn't provide proof for this. The article, nor you, have shown data that this is a frequent event. On the contrary, the AMA publishes reasons for denials. Most of the denials are based on duplicate claims, corrections needed on the form, or procedure was done after plan terminated. The only provider on the AMA list that has the denial reason \"These are non-covered services because this is not deemed a 'medical necessity' by the payer\" be large enough to list and not put in other is MEDICARE. Pre-existing condition made it on UHC list at 3% of all claims that are denied (aka 3% of 3%). So to conclude here, you have not shown where denials are invalid and I have shown where denials seem to be for a legitimate non-medical reason.\n Sources:\n http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/368/reportcard-short.pdf\n \n Third, you needed to show the denial rates are different from non-profit insurance providers such as Medicare. Again I go back to PayerView and the AMA site. Both show denial claims can vary between regions and by year but on a national average it seems they range between 3-8% denial rate. Medicare is actually the highest in 2008 on the AMA site. Medi-Cal (the medicaid provider in California) is at 19.5% for 2009 while the BCBS providers were at 8.7 and 10% respectively. MassHealth is significantly higher than any other provider is Massachusetts. Amerigroup who is a for profit company that manages medicare and medicaid has a high denial rate in Texas according to PayerView. So overall it doesn't seem like there is much of a difference and if anything the Medicare and Medicaid providers are higher! To conclude, you have not shown the denial rates are higher for profit companies as opposed to non-profit companies. \n Sources:\n PayerView :: Healthcare Payer Performance\n http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/368/reportcard-short.pdf\n \n So I have identified three areas that you needed to prove your claim: 1) The denial rates are really that high 2)That the denials are invalid and 3) That the denial rates are higher for profit companies as opposed to non-profit companies. I've shown denial rates in the article are not accurate. I have shown that denial rates are more often than not a \"paperwork\" issue and that it can't be shown they are invalid. I have shown the denial rates among non-profits is equal to if not higher than profit companies. \n \n Too bad this isn't in the formal debate thread.",

   "Insurance companies have been calling their own shots on who they'll cover, when they'll cover them, and how much they charge to cover them for years. They have a huge, well-funded lobby and are chummy with many politicians, mostly Republican, as well as with each other.

   "Finally we got a point...albeit one I already easily refuted.\n\n Actually, no. You haven't...\n \n \n \nSo insurance companies are denying in order to increase profits. In order to make such a claim you would have to first provide proof of the denial claims and second show the denials are invalid ...\n\n This has already been provided.\n In the article there were a variety of examples of IMPROPERLY DENIED CARE.\n I have the testimony of an ex-CEO WHICH YOU HAVE NEVER ADDRESSED which documents the industry wide corruption.\n \n Not once have you ever addressed the ACTUAL EXAMPLES.\n NOT ONCE have you discussed the statements of that ex-CEO.\n \n \n \n... and third show the denial claims are higher than the non-profit insurance (medicaid/medicare).\n\n Actually, this is completely irrelevant.\n There is no logic in this item. It is a fabricated standard you have created.\n \n By this logic, if the \"medicaid / medicare\" items had issues of their own which improperly inflated denial claims, that would be a separate issue from the healthcare insurance industry issues.\n Some proclaim that government run insurance would have to \"ration\" in order to break even. A claim, which if true, would in fact MIRROR the problem in the private healthcare insurance industry. Leaving absolutely no rational behind insisting that these two have to be \"lower\".\n There are other issues that abound as well. As in the different client base of these situations. Medicare / Medicaid tend to be more for the poor and elderly, a different area that would actually be more prone to sickness in the first place. Different issues creating different situations for denial of care.\n \n The whole \"medicaid/medicare\" situation is an obfuscational approach with no real consequence.\n \n \n \nYour proof for number one is a study printed in the LA Times conducted by 2 nurses associations using insurance company supplied data that is legally required to be submitted, in this case, to the state of California. I've refuted this with two websites (Athena PayerView and the AMA) ...\n\n No. You haven't.\n The AMA web-site SHOWED NO regional analysis.\n How can you claim the AMA numbers refute a study SPECIFICALLY DONE in California???\n \n And going a step further, your previous statements shoot yourself in the foot.\n You claim (although at this stage I think you made the numbers up) that the CA-Medicare has a percentage in excess of 20%.\n But by your logic, your AMA link would \"refute\" YOUR OWN CLAIM cause it says the percentage is only 6.85%...\n emoticon_rolleyes\n \n The AMA link has no application to REGION SPECIFIC numbers.\n \n As for the \"PayerView\", as I have previously pointed out you are relying on a web-site that is IN BED with the insurance companies.\n \n \n \nYou'd like to claim PayerView is \"in bed\" with the insurance companies so therefore we shouldn't trust them but this claim holds no wait.\n\n There you go again.\n You just say my arguments are wrong, BUT PROVIDE NO COUNTER for what I actually said.\n WHY does that argument \"hold no wait (sic)\"??? \n \n \n \nThe AMA publishes this data as well and is remarkably close to the PayerView numbers.\n\n The AMA item you document are NATIONAL SUMMARY numbers.\n NOT CA specific data.\n It refutes nothing!\n \n \n \nFor example PayerView denial rates for Medicare on a national level ...\n\n Again, NATIONAL numbers in NO WAY REFUTE California specific data...\n \n \n \nSecond, you needed to show where the denials are invalid. The LA Times are article gives some examples of denials and I'm going to assume the denials were invalid even when the article doesn't provide proof for this.\n\n Wow dude.\n At this stage, I invite the viewing public to go back to the very first post in this thread to review what the article gave for examples.\n You claim that isn't \"proof\" of invalidity???\n The really funny thing about this is that some of the statements talk about AUTHORITY REVERSED denial claims.\n An authority (be it court or special panel) reviewed the merits of denying the claim, and the article EXPLICITLY STATES that the ruling was in favor of the patient.\n Your head is stuck in the sand...\n \n \n \nThe article, nor you, have shown data that this is a frequent event.\n\n I gave the testimony of an ex-CEO who explicitly acknowledged it WAS a frequent event, ENCOURAGED by the healthcare insurance companies.\n \n You continue to ignore it.\n \n \n \nThird, you needed to show the denial rates are different from non-profit insurance providers such as Medicare.\n\n No.\n I do not.\n For the reasons explained above.\n \n \n \nSo I have identified three areas that you needed to prove your claim: 1) The denial rates are really that high 2)That the denials are invalid and 3) That the denial rates are higher for profit companies as opposed to non-profit companies. I've shown denial rates in the article are not accurate.\n\n No. You haven't.\n You have quoted two articles. One of which ONLY gave national numbers, ergo inapplicable to the LA CALIFORNIA study.\n The other from a company which is in bed with the insurance companies.\n \n In the mean-time, you IGNORE the original evidence DOCUMENTING cases where rulings were made AGAINST the insurance companies.\n You IGNORE the testimony of an ex-CEO of a healthcare insurance company which acknowledged EXPLICITLY what I am talking about.\n \n I will close with his statements which you continue to ignore.\n \n \nOpponents suggest that a \"government takeover\" of health care will be a milestone on the road to \"socialized medicine,\" and when he hears those terms, Wendell Potter cringes. He's embarrassed that opponents are using a playbook that he helped devise.\n \n \"Over the years I helped craft this messaging and deliver it,\" he noted.\n \n Mr. Potter was an executive in the health-insurance industry for nearly 20 years before his conscience got the better of him. He served as head of corporate communications for Humana and then for Cigna.\n \n He flew in corporate jets to industry meetings to plan how to block health reform, he says. He rode in limousines to confabs to concoct messaging to scare the public about reform. But in his heart, he began to have doubts as the business model for insurance evolved in recent years from spreading risk to dumping the risky.\n ....\n Mr. Potter says he liked his colleagues and bosses in the insurance industry, and respected them. They are not evil. But he adds that they are removed from the consequences of their decisions, as he was, and are obsessed with sustaining the company's stock price -- which means paying fewer medical bills.\n \n One way to do that is to deny requests for expensive procedures. A second is \"rescission\" -- seizing upon a technicality to cancel the policy of someone who has been paying premiums and finally gets cancer or some other expensive disease. A congressional investigation into rescission found that three insurers, including Blue Cross of California, used this technique to cancel more than 20,000 policies over five years, saving the companies $300 million in claims.\n \n As the Los Angeles Times has reported, insurers encourage this approach through performance evaluations. One Blue Cross employee earned a perfect evaluation score after dropping thousands of policyholders who faced nearly $10 million in medical expenses.\n \n Mr. Potter notes that a third tactic is for insurers to raise premiums for a small business astronomically after an employee is found to have an illness that will be very expensive to treat. That forces the business to drop coverage for all its employees or go elsewhere.\n \n All this is monstrous, and it negates the entire point of insurance, which is to spread risk.\n\n Read more: Nicholas D.

I say PR executive to point out this guy was not actually making any decisions related to profits. He is simply the spin master. So fair enough. We have Wendell Potter claiming the health insurance companies are using rescission to deny claims....on a national level. \n \n I'd like to point out here that after you saying I am not looking at just California you also pull out a generalized article that is not specific to California. Make up your mind.\n \n So we look at Wendell Potter who claims rescission is one way the health insurance companies make their money. Wait what? Health Insurance companies have a 3.3% profit margin last I looked. That is significantly lower than other insurances and most industries. Nevertheless, Potter's claims could still be true if he had some evidence to support this. Potter still has to show rescission is a big problem. Perhaps you can help him out and show me what the \"rescission rate\" is for health insurance companies. You can pull out all the examples you want but at the end of the day it proves nothing without real data. \n \n We've already established that denial rates are in the 4-6% range which is on par with non-profits. We've already established the reasons for denial, of which most are paperwork errors. Are the insurance companies screwing over some people? No doubt. With 90 million+ insured and huge insurance companies (with lack of competition and free market I might add) trying to make a profit I bet you could get 100,000 or so people (one tenth of 1%) who had an issue. The company gets sued and often times ends up losing. So what are the numbers foundit? The stories aren't going to do it because frankly I can find a large number of people mad with their car insurance but that doesn't mean they are evil. \n \n And back to your original point, you of course have to prove it is higher than non-profits. You're whole point is that they do it for profit reasons. Naturally you would expect a difference in the two. You have not shown this. You have not shown proof the denial numbers in the LA Times article are accurate...which they aren't. Finally, you can't show that they are invalid. That really is your biggest fault. You can give examples but you can't provide real data. \n \n This is a classic example with what is wrong in the US today. You want people to make decisions based on emotion alone with no data. This is sick! People should be making decisions based upon true data and logical reasoning. Emotion can play a role but to only use it leads to misrepresentation like you are doing here. \n \n Now, will you actually provide data for your claims or not?",

   "More info on rescission.\n What Steeeeve doesn't seem to grasp (or is callously ignoring) is that rescission IS NOT practiced on people who routinely pay their health insurance premiums, but then don't use most of it.\n The insurance company will happily continue to cash the checks of people who don't ask them for money...\n \n Rescission is practiced on people WHO NEED their healthcare insurance policy the most. The people who suddenly contract cancer. The people who have a costly accident.\n THOSE are the people who are affected...\n \n \nHalf of the insured population uses virtually no health care at all.

A different underwriting manager then verifies the analysis. If we determine that the omission was not material, the review is complete and we do not rescind the coverage. If the omission was material, the underwriting manager makes a recommendation to a review panel, which includes at least one physician. This panel evaluates the information and makes a decision. The amount of the potential claim is never disclosed to the underwriters or review panel. The decision to rescind is made only in cases where the undisclosed information would have made a material difference to the underwriting decision based on our gUidelines.\n \n The consumer is given the opportunity to provide additional information before coverage is rescinded. This information is evaluated and a decision is made.\n If the consumer is dissatisfied with the decision, we provide multiple opportunities for appeal, which now include the option to request a medical review by an independent, third-party company. If the rescission review process determines that the omitted information is material, Assurant Health attempts to avoid rescission by offering other options. For example,\n many people are offered an exclusionary rider for the previously undisclosed condition, so that the coverage otherwise continues in effect. Even if the application would have been declined had the accurate information been known when we underwrote the risk, Assurant Health does not rescind coverage for the entire family, but rather, offers to \"reform\" the coverage so that other family members can maintain their health insurance coverage.\n \n Rescission is rare.

You have backed off of this argument and now claim it is supplemented by this testimony and presumptuous math. \n \n The testimony merely states that rescission is making millions for the health insurance companies.

Instead, we can just concentrate on this diversion from the real issue. \n \n At this time I'd like to point out that Kaiser no longer does rescission and hasn't since 2006 and has offered to reinstate those who were effected in California.\n Statement from Kaiser Permanente Regarding Coverage of Former Kaiser Permanente Members | Kaiser Permanente News Center\n \n Pacificare had some 51 in 2 years and BCBS of CA had some 1,600+ over 4 years. \n \n Apparently with Pacificare a lot of these were people who said they were not pregnant who really were. In other words they committed fraud. Also in California Kaiser we find this out: \"The DMHC upheld our rescissions over 90 percent of the time when members appealed our decisions. We were upheld in 67 of 71 appeals by the DMHC.\n \n In 2004 and 2005, the DMHC did not reverse any of our rescission decisions - every appeal was upheld. In 2006, we started seeing a few reversals.\"\n \n BCBS of California in 2007 agreed to stop rescission without just cause and, in agreement with California, they submitted a new form. \n \n So what we can find when we don't look at Huffington Post all day?\n \n So where does this leave us? Still with .5% of the insured having rescission happen to them. Still not knowing WHO this is actually effecting. I've shown testimony that they don't look at the size of the claim but whether or not the discovered error of fact causes a material difference in the policy. Therefore it is not reasonable to assume this would happen to the top 5%. People have been canceled when they go to the doctor and get blood work done only! \n \n You want to vilify the health insurance companies yet you can't show they are being unreasonable.

For now we can leave alone the obvious point that rescission and denials don't really effect the cost of health care and minimally effect the number uninsured which are the primary arguments for health care reform.\n\n There are times I look at Steeeeve's statements and wonder not whether or not he knows how insurance works...\n ... but rather if he recognizes how REALITY works...\n \n Steeeeve claims: \"obvious point that rescission and denials don't really effect the cost of health care\"\n \n Let's examine this claim.\n Case A) John gets cancer. John's insurance contract covers his cancer treatment by Company_X's healthcare insurance.\n Company_X pays $50,000 (as the contract mandates) to offset John's healthcare payments.\n \n Case B) John gets cancer. John's insurance contract covers his cancer treatment by Company_X's healthcare insurance.\n Company_X rescinds John's coverage instead of paying $50,000\n \n Scenario A? Company_X pays $50,000.\n Scenario B? Company_X does not pay $50,000.\n \n Obviously, rescission DOES affect the COMPANY's bottom line of THEIR cost of healthcare.\n If John cannot pay the hospital, he will probably NOT GET the treatment in the first place.\n \n Obviously, a LOT is affected by rescission that Steeeeve wants us to just blindly believe what he claims is \"obvious\"...\n \n \n \nInstead, we can just concentrate on this diversion from the real issue. \n\n All of this is part of the same issue.\n \n \n \nAt this time I'd like to point out that Kaiser no longer does rescission and hasn't since 2006 and has offered to reinstate those who were effected in California.\n Statement from Kaiser Permanente Regarding Coverage of Former Kaiser Permanente Members | Kaiser Permanente News Center\n\n I can't help but laugh at Steeeeve quoting Kaiser Permanente ADMITTING THEY DID WRONG.\n If there was nothing wrong in the first place, WHY CHANGE their policy??? emoticon_mad\n \n And at this stage, I am of the opinion of \"too little, too late\".\n We need SERIOUS legislation to prevent them from ever deciding (obviously without a public statement) that they would once again start the practice of abusive rescission.\n \n If John announces that he won't go 65 MPH through the school zone anymore, do we just sit back and look at each other and think \"okay. we're done\"???\n No. We should obviously CREATE laws to ENFORCE the school zone speed limit, so that people like John can't decide to change their minds...\n \n \n \nPacificare had some 51 in 2 years and BCBS of CA had some 1,600+ over 4 years. \n\n What is this supposed to prove?\n That some were more guilty than others?\n I never said anything about automatic equal guilt across the board.\n \n Anybody who looks at the original article can see that some companies were obviously worse than others.\n Aetna had only 6.5% of claims denied. MUCH lower than the rest of the companies.\n \n Furthermore, WHERE do these numbers supposedly come from?\n I have already exposed Steeeeve's false claim of CA-Medicare being over 20% denial. He hasn't even tried to show where it came from, and I quoted the ACTUAL statistics from his PayerView web-site which were much lower...\n And now he just starts tossing out numbers with no citation???\n \n And on another level, people should realize that \"rescission\" IS NOT THE ONLY METHOD of denying healthcare insurance coverage.\n There is also the ever popular \"pre-existing condition\" and also other pathetic tricks like complaining about paper-work errors.\n \n \n \nAlso in California Kaiser we find this out: [I]\"The DMHC upheld our rescissions over 90 percent of the time when members appealed our decisions. We were upheld in 67 of 71 appeals by the DMHC.\n\n We need a SERIOUS overhaul of even the governmental involvement.\n It has been seen many times in the past how the FDA has become hopelessly intertwined with the pharmaceutical industry to act as virtually a rubber stamp with ineffective testing.\n \n \n \nBCBS of California in 2007 agreed to stop rescission without just cause and, in agreement with California, they submitted a new form. \n\n Great.\n Another company admitting guilt.\n Anybody else want to trust that they'll never start up with these practices again?\n \n And furthermore, I just have to refer back to a little gem I revealed in a previous post, that Steeeeve is PREDICTABLY IGNORING...\n The committee found that during the previous five years, three health insurers-Assurant Health, WellPoint, and Golden Rule-had saved more than $300 million by rescinding nearly 20,000 policies based on omissions policyholders made in filling out enrollment forms. Asked (in this season of reform-minded industry concessions) whether they would pledge to stop rescissions except in cases of intentional fraud, the chief executives of all three companies said that they would not. Why you can't trust your health insurer. - By Timothy Noah - Slate Magazine\n \n This is the type of vileness that is driven by corporate greed.\n The government asks these companies to stop rescissions except in cases of intentional fraud, and ALL THREE COMPANIES REFUSED!!!\n Hardly sounds like the cooperation Steeeeve is talking about, huh... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nSo what we can find when we don't look at Huffington Post all day?\n\n Have I even quoted Huffington once in this thread??? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nSo where does this leave us? Still with .5% of the insured having rescission happen to them.\n\n And again, Steeeeve tries to use the wrong metrics in order to obfuscate the seriousness of the evil nature of rescission.\n \n The companies DO NOT rescind just ANY policy.\n They go after THE LARGEST COSTS. The people who are VERY sick and NEED more money to get better.\n \n \nIf the top 5% is the absolute largest population for whom rescission would make sense, the probability of having your policy cancelled given that you have filed a claim is fully 10% (0.5% rescission/5.0% of the population). If you take the LA Times estimate that $300mm was saved by abrogating 20,000 policies in California ($15,000/policy), you are somewhere in the 15% zone, depending on the convexity of the top section of population. If, as I suspect, rescission is targeted toward the truly bankrupting cases - the top 1%, the folks with over $35,000 of annual claims who could never be profitable for the carrier - then the probability of having your policy torn up given a massively expensive condition is pushing 50%. One in two. You have three times better odds playing Russian Roulette.\n\n 'Rescissions': The neutron bomb of health insurance - Feb. 13, 2007\n \n \n \nStill not knowing WHO this is actually effecting.\n\n I show who it is affecting.\n Steeeeve ignores it and insists he doesn't know.\n Sticking his head in the sand. \n \n \n \nI've shown testimony that they don't look at the size of the claim but whether or not the discovered error of fact causes a material difference in the policy.\n\n TESTIMONY FROM WHO??? \n I have shown testimony from a DOCUMENTED EX-CEO who explicitly explains what they do...\n \n \nMr. Potter says he liked his colleagues and bosses in the insurance industry, and respected them. They are not evil. But he adds that they are removed from the consequences of their decisions, as he was, and are obsessed with sustaining the company's stock price -- which means paying fewer medical bills.\n \n One way to do that is to deny requests for expensive procedures. A second is \"rescission\" -- seizing upon a technicality to cancel the policy of someone who has been paying premiums and finally gets cancer or some other expensive disease. A congressional investigation into rescission found that three insurers, including Blue Cross of California, used this technique to cancel more than 20,000 policies over five years, saving the companies $300 million in claims.\n \n As the Los Angeles Times has reported, insurers encourage this approach through performance evaluations. One Blue Cross employee earned a perfect evaluation score after dropping thousands of policyholders who faced nearly $10 million in medical expenses.\n \n Mr. Potter notes that a third tactic is for insurers to raise premiums for a small business astronomically after an employee is found to have an illness that will be very expensive to treat. That forces the business to drop coverage for all its employees or go elsewhere.\n \n All this is monstrous, and it negates the entire point of insurance, which is to spread risk.\n\n Read more: Nicholas D.

   "The same old same old from Foundit.\n \n You still repeat those maths stats that make assumption which are flat our false. In fact, you don't even try to justify any of the claims you make. \n \n What you fail to realize that rescission is not done to the top 5% and it doesn't make sense just to do it to those people. You basically presume your conclusion. They don't actually look at the bills that come in. They figure out if a misstatement by someone materially effects what plan they have (as in the price they pay).\n \n It makes sense that if you say on the application you are a 25yr old man with no history of heart disease and weigh 180lbs but inreality you are a 40yr old man overweight with a long history of heart disease in your family that when you have a heart attack your health insurance should cancel you for lying to them. They base the price you pay on what you tell them. Considering that in California...which is much more strict...one company was upheld 90% of the time, I'd say rescission is fairly valid in many cases if not most. Given that I'm the only one of us that actually researches issues..I'd say it is fairly obvious.\n \n What you also fail to realize is that I mentioned Kaiser because you stated they had one of the highest denial rates. Turns out this has nothing to do with rescission since they don't practice that in California. Furthermore, we already know that number is inflated. \n \n Finally, you still can show that denials or rescission is invalid. You simply assume they are all invalid and only for the top 5% of those making policy claims. You're refusal to show actual data just ruins any argument you make.\n \n Most importantly, rescission doesn't effect health costs which is the primary argument in the US. with 16% of our GDP going to health care costs you really can't say getting rid of rescission will reduce that...nor will it dramatically help the uninsured. Basically your goal here is to smear the health insurance companies with BS that isn't true. \n \n Keep trying, I'll keep easily refuting it.",
