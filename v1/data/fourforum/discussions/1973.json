(If anyone out there thinks that China will step up and save France...go seek psychological help). The fickle foreign relations enjoyed by France since the days of Napoleon continuously predispose them to being attacked, simply for the reason that terrorists and conquesting dictators know that true friends of France are few and far between, and there are not many in the world willing to step up and fight on their behalf. I sincerely hope that the next time France gets itself into trouble, the US stands back and watches, even abstains or vetos the UN resolution to save their butts. This is perhaps the only way that France will ever see that appeasing terrorists and ignoring oppresive and dangerous regimes will only hurt them in the long run. And now Spain...jeesh. Keep rolling over and showing your belly long enough, sooner or later someone will stick a knife in it.",

   "That's France for you.\n \n I agree. France does what is convinient for itself... it asks for protection when it needs it, but can't give any support in return. Spain is going the same way now, because they are socialist as well. The day Paris is left burning is the day they will learn. I will not wish that upon anyone, but that is the only way they will see. I just hope that we don't extend our hand.",
