Where is ANY evidence of god? One verifiable shred of evidence? Please enlighten me.\n\n If you think for one second that carbon dating works you are way wrong about that. Radiation from the sun strikes the atmosphere of the earth all day long. This energy converts about 21 pounds of nitrogen into radioactive carbon 14. This radioactive carbon 14 slowly decays back into normal, stable nitrogen. Extensive laboratory testing has shown that about half of the C-14 molecules will decay in 5730 years. This is called the half-life. After another 5730 years half of the remaining C-14 will decay leaving only 1/4 of the original C-14. It goes from 1/2 to 1/4 to 1/8, etc. In theory it would never totally disappear, but after about 5 half lives the difference is not measurable with any degree of accuracy. This is why most people say carbon dating is only good for objects less than 40,000 years old. Nothing on earth carbon dates in the millions of years, because the scope of carbon dating only extends a few thousand years. Willard Libby invented the carbon dating technique in the early 1950's. The amount of carbon 14 in the atmosphere today (about .0000765%), is assumed there would be the same amount found in living plants or animals since the plants breath CO2 and animals eat plants. Carbon 14 is the radio-active version of carbon. \n Since solar radiation causes the formation of C-14 in the atmosphere, and normal radioactive decay takes it out, there must be a point where the formation rate and the decay rate equalizes. This is called the point of equilibrium. the C-14 is being formed and decaying simultaneously. A freshly created earth would require about 30,000 years for the amount of C-14 in the atmosphere to reach this point of equilibrium because it would leak out as it is being filled. Tests indicate that the earth has still not reached equilibrium. There is more C-14 in the atmosphere now than there was 40 years ago. This would prove the earth is not yet 30,000 years old! This also means that plants and animals that lived in the past had less C-14 in them than do plants and animals today. Just this one fact totally upsets data obtained by C-14 dating. \n The carbon in the atmosphere normally combines with oxygen to make carbon dioxide (CO2). Plants breathe CO2 and make it part of their tissue. Animals eat the plants and make it part of their tissues. A very small percentage of the carbon plants take in is radioactive C-14. When a plant or animal dies it stops taking in air and food so it should not be able to get any new C-14. The C-14 in the plant or animal will begin to decay back to normal nitrogen. The older an object is, the less carbon-14 it contains. One gram of carbon from living plant material causes a Geiger counter to click 16 times per minute as the C-14 decays. A sample that causes 8 clicks per minute would be 5,730 years old (the sample has gone through one half life), and so on. (See chart on page 46 about C-14). Although this technique looks good at first, carbon-14 dating rests on two simple assumptions. They are, obviously, assuming the amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere has always been constant, and its rate of decay has always been constant. Neither of these assumptions is provable or reasonable. \n The answer changes based on the assumptions. Similarly, scientists do not know that the carbon-14 decay rate has been constant. They do not know that the amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere is constant. Present testing shows the amount of C-14 in the atmosphere has been increasing since it was first measured in the 1950's. This may be tied in to the declining strength of the magnetic field. This is the same problem the other entire dating methods evolutionist use.\n \n And if you think that that is how they date rocks or fossils you are dead wrong. Before you go date a rock you first have to say what part of the geological column you found it in. father you tell them that they use a certain dating method that is within the geological column so the dates are picked dates based on the assumption of the geologic column. I would say that design is the best evidence for creation because there is just so much design in our earth and envirse\n \n got carbon dating form www.dr.dino.com",

   "http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/benton.html\n \n \n Accuracy of dating\n Dating in geology may be relative or absolute. Relative dating is done by observing fossils, as described above, and recording which fossil is younger, which is older. The discovery of means for absolute dating in the early 1900s was a huge advance. The methods are all based on radioactive decay:\n \n Fossils may be dated by calculating the rate of decay of certain elements.Certain naturally occurring elements are radioactive, and they decay, or break down, at predictable rates. \n Chemists measure the half-life of such elements, i.e., the time it takes for half of the radioactive parent element to break down to the stable daughter element. Sometimes, one isotope, or naturally occurring form, of an element decays into another, more stable form of the same element. \n By comparing the proportions of parent to daughter element in a rock sample, and knowing the half-life, the age can be calculated. \n Older fossils cannot be dated by carbon-14 methods and require radiometric dating.Scientists can use different chemicals for absolute dating:\n \n The best-known absolute dating technique is carbon-14 dating, which archaeologists prefer to use. However, the half-life of carbon-14 is only 5730 years, so the method cannot be used for materials older than about 70,000 years. \n Radiometric dating involves the use of isotope series, such as rubidium/strontium, thorium/lead, potassium/argon, argon/argon, or uranium/lead, all of which have very long half-lives, ranging from 0.7 to 48.6 billion years. Subtle differences in the relative proportions of the two isotopes can give good dates for rocks of any age. \n Scientists can check their accuracy by using different isotopes.The first radiometric dates, generated about 1920, showed that the Earth was hundreds of millions, or billions, of years old. Since then, geologists have made many tens of thousands of radiometric age determinations, and they have refined the earlier estimates. A key point is that it is no longer necessary simply to accept one chemical determination of a rock's age. Age estimates can be cross-tested by using different isotope pairs. Results from different techniques, often measured in rival labs, continually confirm each other.\n \n There is only a 1% chance of error with current dating technology.Every few years, new geologic time scales are published, providing the latest dates for major time lines. Older dates may change by a few million years up and down, but younger dates are stable. For example, it has been known since the 1960s that the famous Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, the line marking the end of the dinosaurs, was 65 million years old. Repeated recalibrations and retests, using ever more sophisticated techniques and equipment, cannot shift that date. It is accurate to within a few thousand years. With modern, extremely precise, methods, error bars are often only 1% or so.\n \n Conclusion: The strict rules of the scientific method ensure the accuracy of fossil dating.Conclusion\n The fossil record is fundamental to an understanding of evolution. Fossils document the order of appearance of groups and they tell us about some of the amazing plants and animals that died out long ago. Fossils can also show us how major crises, such as mass extinctions, happened, and how life recovered after them. If the fossils, or the dating of the fossils, could be shown to be inaccurate, all such information would have to be rejected as unsafe. Geologists and paleontologists are highly self-critical, and they have worried for decades about these issues. Repeated, and tough, regimes of testing have confirmed the broad accuracy of the fossils and their dating, so we can read the history of life from the rocks with confidence.",

   "Accuracy of the fossils\n Fossils prove that humans did not exist alongside dinosaurs.Since 1859, paleontologists, or fossil experts, have searched the world for fossils. In the past 150 years they have not found any fossils that Darwin would not have expected. New discoveries have filled in the gaps, and shown us in unimaginable detail the shape of the great 'tree of life'. Darwin and his contemporaries could never have imagined the improvements in resolution of stratigraphy that have come since 1859, nor guessed what fossils were to be found in the southern continents, nor predicted the huge increase in the number of amateur and professional paleontologists worldwide. All these labors have not led to a single unexpected finding such as a human fossil from the time of the dinosaurs, or a Jurassic dinosaur in the same rocks as Silurian trilobites.\n \n Scientists now use phylogeny, mathematics, and other computations to date fossils.Paleontologists now apply sophisticated mathematical techniques to assess the relative quality of particular fossil successions, as well as the entire fossil record. These demonstrate that, of course, we do not know everything (and clearly never will), but we know enough. Today, innovative techniques provide further confirmation and understanding of the history of life. Biologists actually have at their disposal several independent ways of looking at the history of life - not only from the order of fossils in the rocks, but also through phylogenetic trees.\n \n Phylogenetic trees are the family trees of particular groups of plants or animals, showing how all the species relate to each other.\n \n Phylogenetic trees are drawn up mathematically, using lists of morphological (external form) or molecular (gene sequence) characters.\n \n Modern phylogenetic trees have no input from stratigraphy, so they can be used in a broad way to make comparisons between tree shape and stratigraphy.\n \n The majority of test cases show good agreement, so the fossil record tells the same story as the molecules enclosed in living organisms.",

   "It would be better if you just posted a link rather than bulk-copying someone else's work; people might get the wrong idea.\n \n First of all:\n \n \nSince solar radiation causes the formation of C-14 in the atmosphere, and normal radioactive decay takes it out, there must be a point where the formation rate and the decay rate equalizes. This is called the point of equilibrium.\n\n Very true. However, the atmospheric production of C-14 is not constant. It has been shown to vary according to the strength of the earth's magnetic field. To use Kent's 'holey barrel' analogy, imagine you keep slowly adjusting the flow of the water up and down. The point of equilibrium keep changing, so the level of water in the barrel will also keep rising and falling to meet it, no matter how long the barrel has been there. Thus Kent's inference of a young earth (from the fact C-14 levels are not at equilibrium) is flawed.\n \nThis also means that plants and animals that lived in the past had less C-14 in them than do plants and animals today. Just this one fact totally upsets data obtained by C-14 dating.\n\n No, it just means that the C-14 curve must be - and is - calibrated via other methods. Scientists use tree rings, ice cores, sediment cores, lake varves, coral samples and cave deposits to independently calibrate historical levels of atmospheric C-14. \n \n Count back 5,000 years in tree rings, 5000 years in lake varves, 5000 years in coral samples, and you find the same levels of atmospheric C-14 in all of them, so you know what 5,000 years old 'looks like' in C-14 terms. This allows you to date a fossil with that level of C-14 at 5000 years old. Fair enough? Ok. Now, we have multiply-independent calibration curves for C-14 extending back at least 26,000 years, so we can date anything within the last 26,000 years pretty darn accurately (there are some historical periods where the changes in atmospheric C14 make dating less accurate).\n \n Not only does this dispose of the criticisms vs C-14 dating, it also exposes something more fundamental: we have multiple independent lines of evidence going back at least 26,000 years.",

Until you've shown you're capable of doing that and hence show you're worth of spending even the slightest effort kicking your XXX, I'll stick to refuting the PRATTs with links that you won't read.\n \n Since you clearly aren't aware:\n PRATT = Point Refuted A Thousand Times\n \n \nyou say that I am incorrect and all you do is go on websites to do you talking.\n\n And you ignore my websites.

I'd make the claims, and you'd either call me a liar or you'd ask for sources, which would elicit my providing links.\n \n \nThey don't use carbon dating or radiometric dating or any dating they use the geological column\n\n Lie, and a dumbass claim. Why are you railing against radiometric dating as being accurate if you claim that it's not used? You don't really think through anything you say, do you?\n \n \nhttp://www.trueorigin.org/dating.asp#How%20radiometric%20dating%20works%20in%20general \n\n Hey, Holmes, my degree is in chemistry. I teach chemistry. You don't need to link me to a site full of lies to oversimplify how radiometric dating works. I understand it more than the author of that page does.\n \n \nthe Ica stones cannot be modern because there is too much oxidation on the stones.\n\n What the hell are you talking about? If I oxidize your hair, does that prove you're ancient? Because I'll set your hair on fire right now if you'd like...\n \n \nthe people said they made because if you sell the Ica stones you will have two years in jail and there was police behind them so he had to say. Also two years in jail over there is like a death sentence over here in the u.s\n\n Again, what the hell? They DID sell the stones. Is it really your intent to insist that they are genuine when the fabricators admitted carving them? If so, why \"debate\" you at all? You're possibly insane.\n \n \nI dot believe the you links me over to the whale evolution hing legs in the whale that they don't need to use. that is a lie they need it to reproduce so you are the ignorant one and need to study on his whale before making claims like that.\n\n *sigh* If whales needed leg bones to reproduce, why do some whales have none? AND REPRODUCE WITHOUT THEM?! But, you know, by all means, tell me I'm ignorant of whales. :xbanghead \n \n \nthey first see the layer in which fossils are found they than use a specific type of radiometric dating to date it but they frist have to know what layer it is in.\n\n You could use every type. If you have a sample that's 100000 years old, and you try to date it using radiocarbon techniques, the lab will tell you that it's too old (or that it's age is greater than 50000 years). But they'll charge you for the test anyway. We get round numbers from the stratum to save time, money, and resources. It's not a conspiracy, it's smart. But you don't get that, do you?\n \n \nI ask you how does it feel using such stupid arguments.\n\n I'm sorry, did you even read my previous post? Hello? Hello?",

In either case, though: No, the oxidation doesn't indicate anything. I can artificially remove or introduce oxidation. Even if we assume that the sample wasn't intentionally tainted, where is the evidence that the rate of oxidation of the stone material lends itself to dating the rocks at some particular age?\n The bottom line is that the forgers admitted making the forgeries.

I think your understanding of the use of DNA by molecular archaeologists could be better informed, but its use is pretty much fully accepted by the scientific community. As to your clams, the answer (as it often is) is the simplest one. The clams adjusted to fit a niche that did and does exist. The question would be, if 'god' is all powerful and infallible, why are there so many fits, starts and dead ends in the species tree...\n \n As for the question of matter. It has been shown that the entire (observable) universe can be back traced to a single point of (nearly) infinite density. That is as far as we can take it (about 13.7 Billion years) and that is all we can DEFINITIVELY take it. Any sense of time in THIS universe started there and trying to define any sense of time before that just leads to a 'tower of turtles' argument. As to 'why' the big bang happened the leading thoughts are a collision of membranes (10 or 11d) or perhaps a white hole exit from a corresponding black hole in another universe. \n \n To say 'matter can neither created or destroyed' is from the 2nd law of thermodynamics. (at least I think its the 2nd law). What it means is that the total energy/matter in the universe will not change, ie. if you burn a log you get an = amount of by products. Even converting matter to energy keeps the same amount of energy matter via E=MC2. That's what they mean by that, you can only change the 'form' of matter not its total mass/energy.",

You have a tail bone. \n \n Human beings retain the genetic code for vestigial tails. We have additional genes that \"turn off\" the coding so that most people do not actually have tails. However, the coccyx, or tailbone, is the remnant of a lost tail. All mammals have a tail at one point in their development. In humans, it is present for a period of 4 weeks, during stages 14 to 22 of human embryonic development. This tail is most visible in human embryos 31-35 days old. The tailbone, (at the end of the spine), has lost its original function in assisting balance and mobility, though it still serves some secondary functions, such as being an attachment point for muscles, which explains why it has not degraded further. (Natural selection - evolution)\n Since tails are part of our genetic code, and part of our embryonic development, why would God have made that little detail if He actually fashioned us out of \"dirt\". \n \n Doesn't it make more sense that He guided the process of evolution, and when we were \"ready\" gave us our immortal souls \"in His image?\"\n \n Genesis does not have to be at war with science.
