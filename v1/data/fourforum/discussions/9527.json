Let me know.\n \n In addition, we have a new area in the formal debate section called \"Ringside\" where readers offer their opinions and advice on the debate. I imagine this may be a useful tool for anyone wishing to learn how to sharpen their presentation.

   "AAAGH! I'm so sorry Wildflower, but something has gone wrong with my PC (its restarting itself every couple of minutes for some reason) so I think this debate might have to wait if you're still up for it.\n \n Hopefully you read this before your assessment though, was just quickly going to outline the points that your opposition are probably going to make (it may seem a little odd as some of them are a bit contradictory but who knows which direction they will come from). I'll put what I see as a potential counter beneath it.\n \n \n Its a basic human right to have a family\n - The Planned Birth policy doesn't prevent that, nor does is it a basic human right to have as many children as possible, such a right would be ridiculous due to the vast number of factors that limit this such as the couples income, fertility and how willing the other partner is. A fine isn't much different from this. At this point you might want to stress how 'one child policy' is not the right name as people aren't actually limited to just one child.\n \n Its unnecessary China's population density is actually less than several of the surrounding countries, including Japan.\n - Not all of those surrounding countries are like Japan, Bangladesh also has a very high population density and suffers from it. Population density alone isn't the only factor, the size of the population is also important.\n \n Its redundant, as china's economy modernises the birth rate will fall in the same way that western birth rates have fallen. Its just draconian legislation for its own sake.\n - True, and this has been observed in parts of China. However large proportions of China are much poorer than the more developed areas like the cities. These sorts of areas tend to have much larger families and this was encouraged before the planned family policy, without the policy its quite possible that the population in these regions would grow too large for the environment to support it, especially since it is still recovering from the population boom that occured before the policy was introduced.\n \n Forced abortions/sterilisation and other human rights abuses\n - These aren't part of the policy, but a result of some officials taking things into their own hands. The policy just levees fines for additional children and other monetary penalties (sometimes related to job options and sometimes related to public services). Its like saying prison rape is part of the criminal justice system in the US.\n \n The single children are going to be spoiled, the \"Little Emperor\" problem.\n - Can this really be said to be a problem with the policy, or is it really the fault of the parents? More importantly, the average fertility rate for China nears two children per person rather than just one. There is no evidence that this is a problem now that the first generation has reached adulthood (its more likely been overexagerrated because nobody likes anyone else's kids).\n \n Due to inheritance and social pressures, girls are being aborted in favour of future boys creating an inbalance between the sexs.\n - The policy actually allows you to have a second child if the first one is female or disabled in several provinces, but this is potential issue. However it may also serve to promote equality and women's rights at the same time.\n \n Any drastic decrease in population like this is going to cause a small working population to support a much larger elderly one. Single children will have to support two parents, and their children may well be supporting four grandparents and two parents each.\n - Its a problem with western society as well, hardly something limited to china. Don't forget that one child isn't the norm, they are much closer to Europe's fertility rate of just under 2 children per family than 1. Unrestricted growth in the poorer areas isn't going to support the aging population of the cities and is probably going to make it even harder for families to support themselves in more rural areas as the land can only support so many people.\n \n Again, sorry about this but I hope this helps. Right, I'm off to by a new hard drive so I can rescue all my old stuff *sob*",

Today in school we had Day 1 of Trial, in which the other side (Prosecution), presented their Opening Statement, Case of Facts, and some of their Rebuttal Questions.\n \n I answered most of their rebuttal questions, but my answer strayed away from the last question, because I thought that they were asking a different question than they actually were, if you catch my drift. But other than that, the Defense side did pretty good overall.\n \n On Monday, which will be in 3 days, it will be our turn to present our information and such, I believe. This is where it's going to get easy, but answering the Rebuttal Questions today, you had to think on your feet, and I really like doing that! I want to be a lawyer when I grow up, if possible.",

   "Good to hear it went well, despite my efforts ;)\n Out of curiosity, which points did they go for in the end?\n\n \n Actually, they still have more Rebuttal Questions, as well as their Closing Statement, which they'll address on Monday.\n \n They pointed out the fact that children are treated cruelly in Chinese orphanages and abortion and sterilization is forced. They asked what a family in the Chinese countryside, that are unable to have a child, could do to get a child, if they cannot afford to adopt.\n \n I replied, stating that China had changed most of their cruel methods, like forced abortion, cruel orphanages, and such. \"You're information is not up-to-date. Just because the author of the article wrote the article in 1999, does not mean that the cruel methods were used that recently. They probably were referring to the methods used in the 1970's and 1980's, but now they have modernized the policy, and have withdrawn from most of the cases of cruel abortions, sterilizations, and orphanages.\"\n \n \"A family that cannot afford to adopt, and are unable to have children, can go to the local hospital for help with these matters. Sometimes if a Chinese family is caught with more than one child, they are willing to give their child to a family like that. However, there are not enough families in China to adopt so many children. By starting an adoption agency or foster care program in China, you are not decreasing the over-population of China. You have to put into perspective that over two-thirds of China is uninhabitable, which massively increases the population density.\"\n \n That's the answer where I strayed off a little bit... \n \n What do you think?",
