   "It seems the N Korea situation is starting to seriously spiral out of control. So far, Obama has done very little, nor even offered any solutions, that I can see. N Korea is now threatening nuclear war, and back to capturing journalists for bargaining chips, and things with them have taken a decidedly negative direction since Obama has been in power.\n \n Also, Iran is getting stronger. And the EU is starting to move more toward the center-right as it realizes its left-leaning positions aren't working. \n \n This is the problem with a placating-focused foreign policy position. (The \"apology\" tour epitomized it.) If a leader doesn't at least try to act like he's out for the interests of the nation for whom he represents, he's probably going to be taken advantage of. Relying on Obamamania isn't going to be enough when it comes to foreign policy crisis situations. \"Rock star\" status isn't going to do a thing to help the U.S. in a world where OTHER leaders ARE looking out for their nations as their number one priority.",

   "Huh. Did you give Bush this much **** when he was in the exact same situation with the exact same options all leading to the exact same outcomes?\n \n Or are you just being a hypocrite? \n \n Obama is bad because he won't do anything. But Bush was not even though Obama is doing the same things Bush did. Huh. \n \n For someone who claims that his opponents give a free pass to Obama despite having entirely different circumstances, you sure don't seem to have a problem bashing only Obama despite his position being identical to Bush's. \n \n Here's something novel: Treat politicians the same when they are put into identical situations with identical options and identical outcomes.\n \n As for the EU moving center right, I suggest you look at the policies various EU countries are adopting right now. Germany is toying with laws to prevent any cuts to social welfare forever. Hardly \"Right.\" Your argument stems from the EU election in which fringe groups have typically gained seats. A better and more honest view would be to examine state elections and state policies.",

I saw the options he had and understood why he did nothing.
