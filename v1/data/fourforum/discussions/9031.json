   "I know it's really hard, Lord, but we need the evil to stop:\n \n October 13, 2006\n MOVIE REVIEW | 'DELIVER US FROM EVIL'\n The Lives of Priest and Victims in the Silence After the Anguish \n By A. O. SCOTT\n \"Deliver Us From Evil,\" Amy Berg's important, hard-to-watch debut feature, is not the first documentary about the sexual abuse scandals in the Roman Catholic Church - Kirby Dick's \"Twist of Faith\" was nominated for an Oscar last year - and it will probably not be the last. Pedophilia is not a subject most are eager to think about, but these days it seems impossible to avoid. Neither sensationalistic nor sentimental, Ms. Berg's film is clear-sighted, tough-minded and devastating, a portrait of individual criminality and institutional indifference, a study in the betrayal of trust and the irresponsibility of authority.\n \n What gives the film some of its unnerving power is that, in addition to giving voice to some of the victims of abuse, it spends a lot of time with a perpetrator. Oliver O'Grady is now a silver-haired, twinkly-eyed resident of Ireland, where Ms. Berg often films him in parks and near playgrounds, with children nearby. In the 1970's and 80's, while serving as a parish priest in several towns in Central California, he molested children over and over again, both boys and girls, including, it is reported, a 9-month-old. \n \n Perhaps the creepiest thing about Mr. O'Grady - who was eventually imprisoned, unfrocked and deported to Ireland, where he had grown up - is the contrast between his present demeanor and his past actions. When recalling his crimes, he sometimes chuckles, not spitefully but almost warmly, as if what he had done were silly rather than unspeakably sordid. Although he does not deny anything, he takes refuge in euphemism, explaining that he was often \"overly affectionate\" with his young parishioners and apologizing for having \"offended\" them. \n \n His mild, almost merry manner stands in brutal contrast to the pain expressed by Bob and Maria Jyono, whose daughter, Ann, was among Mr. O'Grady's victims. Mr. Jyono, a Japanese-American Buddhist, converted to Catholicism when he married his wife, whom he met in Ireland. Mr. O'Grady - then Father O'Grady - became a virtual member of their family, spending many nights in their home while he was molesting their daughter. \"Molesting? He raped her,\" Mr. Jyono, a quiet, thoughtful man, cries out at one point, and his anguish at the violation of his daughter, his trust and his faith is almost unbearable to witness.\n \n But Ms. Berg pushes further, sifting through videotaped depositions of some of Mr. O'Grady's supervising bishops, including Roger Cardinal Mahony, the current archbishop of Los Angeles, to argue that the culpability is not Mr. O'Grady's alone. In a pattern by now familiar, Mr. O'Grady's superiors dealt with the threat he posed by transferring him from one parish to another, where he was free to find new prey. Reports were filed, claims were made, but the eminences have only vague recollections and abstractions to offer. It almost goes without saying that no one from the church agreed to be interviewed in the film.\n \n That silence - affirmed when Ann Jyono and another of Mr. O'Grady's victims, Nancy Sloan, are turned away by guards at the Vatican as they try to deliver a letter to the newly installed Pope Benedict XVI - cedes the floor to the church's critics. These include Father Tom Doyle, a canon lawyer and historian who has become a leading advocate for survivors of clerical sexual abuse; Mary Gail Frawley O'Dea, a psychologist; and several of the lawyers representing victims in civil suits. They all point to the hierarchical, secretive, authoritarian nature of the Roman Catholic Church as a central reason for its failure to deal effectively with the likes of Mr. O'Grady. \n \n It would be interesting to hear a response, apart from the canard that the sexual abuse crisis in the church is actually anti-Catholic bigotry or disobedience by a corrupted laity. The Los Angeles district attorney is apparently seeking further answers, spurred in part by some of Mr. O'Grady's testimony in this film. But for now, \"Deliver Us From Evil\" makes the case that justice remains undone.",

   "Punishment in the hereafter just doesn't work for me, EZ.\n \n Also, in the Wall Street Journal:\n \n 'Deliver Us,' Close-Up Study Of Predatory Former Priest, Is a Stunning Documentary\n October 13, 2006; Page W1\n In \"Deliver Us From Evil,\" a literally stunning documentary by Amy Berg, a former priest and convicted pedophile, Oliver O'Grady, faces the camera and confesses his sins in bland, lilting tones that betray a continued befuddlement with his wayward self. Confession may have been good for his soul, but for no one else's. The spectacle of Mr. O'Grady's obtuseness is horrifying in the context the film provides -- two decades of compulsive, systematic and pitiless predations that went unchecked, though not unnoticed by the church, during his priesthood in Northern California.\n \n In another context -- our current concern with inappropriate sexual behavior in government, and with strengthening safeguards for potential young victims -- the documentary is instructive as well as timely. Split off from the consequences of his actions, Mr. O'Grady, who spent seven years in prison, admits that he did bad things, and claims he \"should have been removed, and attended to.\" But he neither acknowledges nor seems to comprehend that he shattered his victims' lives. \"I'm here,\" he says, speaking of his presence as an interview subject, \"because in my life there has been a major imbalance.\"\n \n The euphemism is eerie, to say the least, for his imbalance was the rape of dozens of children, including a 9-month-old infant. Invincibly narcissistic, he still wonders why he wanted to \"reach out\" to children, and, having framed his behavior in self-serving language, draws a self-serving conclusion: \"I guess I was overly affectionate. I guess I went a little too far.\" Asked if he'd ever been diagnosed with a dissociative disorder, he replies blithely: \"I'm sure I've been diagnosed with lots of disorders.\"\n \n That last question comes not in the extended -- and grimly fascinating -- interview conducted expressly for the film, but in a video deposition that Mr. O'Grady gave in 1997. The occasion was a trial, in Stockton, Calif., prompted by an ultimately successful civil suit against the local diocese and its bishop for failing to protect children from a priest -- Father O'Grady -- with a history of molestation.\n \n \"Deliver Us From Evil\" conveys a vivid sense of that history. Ms. Berg, previously an award-winning documentary producer for CBS and CNN, has a reporter's instinct for an important story, and the enterprise to go with it. She sought out Mr. O'Grady, who now lives in Ireland on a pension from the church, and persuaded him to talk on camera. (I wish the film, which has no narration, had made that clear.)\n \n In addition, she has drawn a troubling picture of the priest's superiors -- particularly Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, who was the bishop in Stockton in 1997 -- protecting Father O'Grady and, of course, themselves, rather than any children, by moving him from parish to parish in spite of ever-more urgent warnings and complaints. In a 2004 video deposition related to civil trials in Los Angeles, Cardinal Mahony says he hardly knew Father O'Grady, even though the film shows warmly personal passages from letters evidently exchanged by the two men. (The Cardinal also says, in the same deposition, that sexual urges toward a 9-year-old would not be an automatic cause for removing a priest from his ministry.)\n \n Documentary filmmakers are a breed apart, devoted to their craft in spite of an inexorably shrinking market for feature-length documentaries -- at least those lacking cute kids or adorable penguins. Amy Berg's debut feature may well find a wider audience. It's already in the news; last week an assistant district attorney in Los Angeles was quoted by the New York Times as saying that the film would \"fuel ongoing consideration as to whether Cardinal Mahony and others engaged in criminal activity.\"\n \n \"Deliver Us From Evil\" has its flaws. Certain passages are diffuse, others are argumentative, and there's a discomfiting staginess to the climax, which follows two of Father O'Grady's victims as they journey to the Vatican to deliver a letter to the pope. Yet the film's concern for the victims, and their families, is one of its strengths. One victim, now a grown woman, says she still pulls off the road and dry-heaves whenever she sees a Plymouth Duster like the car Father O'Grady drove. Another victim's father, an American of Japanese ancestry, cries out with inconsolable anguish: \"He was raping her, not molesting her! He was raping her. Five years old, but that's what he did.\" So much for Oliver O'Grady's maunderings about reaching out to little children in the spirit of love.",
