If I, an outspoken believer can do it, then so can you.\n \n Second, see it from their point of view.\n \n And, now, we get on with the debate:\n \n What's wrong with Polygamy? As most people do not know the tales of how it came to be, and what they believe, we're going to not touch that topic.\n But, what's wrong with it?\n \n What is wrong with a man having multiple wives? And, furthermore, what is wrong with that same man hitting his wife? Where do these... Laws that we have in effect come in?\n \n Now, personally, as a woman, I would hit any man back that hit me. But, then again, I'm struggling to see it through their eyes. Seeing what they were brought up as. What they were taught.\n \n Also, this is not a debate that I've posted just so people could show their liberal, yet limited vocabulary (A.K.A Big Words). So, please, don't try and show off. Just debate like rational human beings.",
