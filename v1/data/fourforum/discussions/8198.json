   "[qs]\n The belief that God created the universe in six days is a superstition and a \"kind of paganism\" that both discredits religious faith and demeans science, Br Guy Consolmagno SJ has declared.\n \n Consolmagno, a Jesuit brother who in his scientific work has pioneered the field of gravitoelectrodynamics, said that far from being a Christian viewpoint, creationism harks back to primitive beliefs in \"nature gods\" who were held responsible for natural events.\n \n He said a \"destructive myth\" has developed in modern societies that religion and science are competing ideologies - and that this is fed by creationism, which scholars say is a distortion of the biblical texts it claims as its own.\n [/qs]\n \n http://www.indcatholicnews.com/vatastro259.html",

   "Aristotle believed the universe was eternal. Plato believe the universe was created out of preexisting formless matter.\n\n \n The early Jews believed that also. If you look at Genesis, you can see that it is declared that God formed the earth out of the preexisting 'water'. Water was symbolic of 'chaos'.. so in essense, it is saying God formed the world by seperating order from chaos. \n \n I will have to day that the RCC is not taking the dogmatic approach being against science anymore. They must have learnd their lesson with Gallilao.. It only took them 600 years.",
