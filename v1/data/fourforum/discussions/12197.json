Despite the fact that the weapon had been loaded with Ranger SXTs-considered by many to be one of the best man-stoppers available-Palmer lived for more than four minutes after the last shot was fired. His autopsy revealed nothing more than a small amount of alcohol in his bloodstream. Although Soulis could not have known it, Palmer was wanted for murder in a neighboring state.\n \n 22 direct hits and it still took the guy four minutes to die. That's not very comforting when you only have 10 rounds legally available to you. You don't wanna be finding yourself up against somebody like this for any reason, and not have enough ammunition to effectively stop them. You can try and argue that anything more than a certain number of shots is excessive force, but when 22 shots won't drop you there's basically no such thing as excessive force.",

These laws limiting magazine capacity are based on stupid assumptions that are based on Hollywood (think drive by Hollywood). The average shooting involves less than 5 rounds fired. So limiting the capacity has no affect on crime.",

Nothing is ever good enough for you, you always want more than ever. Well we don't want to abide by your wishes, gun ownership is a recognized right, and your hatred of rights won't be tolerated. We're not going to just stand by and be painted as the bad guys because you have the mentally disabled belief that banning gun ownership will reduce crime, and anybody who disagrees with you want to see people killed.\n \n \nWhen semi-automatic rifles were banned in Australia, hunters welcomed the law.\n\n \n Evidence please.\n \n EDIT: And since when did \"hunting\" become the only recognized and acknowledged sport that a firearm may be used in? What about all those shooting sports?\n \n \nThey saw it as a challenge because it takes greater skill to shoot an animal with a bolt action rifle.\n\n \n This is more bull. It takes a lot of skill no matter what gun you shoot, to hit an animal and kill it in a humane manner.\n \n \nNot so in America where some gun owners like to use guns that could take down planes to shoot small animals.\n\n \n What guns can shoot down planes and blow them out of the sky? Now I know that you're lying, what you're proposing has never happened. Are you referring to the .50 BMG? The civilian legal rifles have been on the market for decades, never once in the entire history of these rifles, has a plane ever been shot down in such a manner.",

That would be bad!\n \n They also spout off about those awful \"high capacity\" magazines enabling lunatics to fire more rounds.\n \n O.K. So instead of popping off 15 rounds in 3 seconds from an evil \"high capacity\" magazine, I now have to pop off 10 rounds...RELOAD...then pop off 5 rounds (= 15 in 4 seconds) ...and I'm still left with 5 extra.\n \n Wow! I just wasted a whole SECOND by having to push a button with my thumb and insert another magazine.\n \n These \"high capacity\" magazines sure are dangerous, aren't they! Now instead of carrying one evil \"high capacity\" 15 round magazine, I carry two benevolent and friendly 10 rounders. I get 5 more shots with only a one second delay, and I'm now politically correct!\n \n (In real life, I carry a 1911, so I only have 8 rounds anyway.) The \"high capacity\" magazine ban doesn't even effect me, so I could care less. I'm just against it because it's moronic.
