   "We, the undersigned organizations, have monitored the ex-gay industry for more than a decade. To our great horror, prominent members of the ex-gay organization Exodus International participated last week in a conference in Uganda that promoted shocking abuses of basic human rights. This included draconian measures against gay and lesbian people such as forced ex-gay therapy, life imprisonment for people convicted of homosexuality and the formation of an organization designed to \"wipe out\" gay practices in Uganda. The conference also featured Scott Lively, a holocaust revisionist who at the event also blamed the 1994 Rwandan genocide on gay people.\n \n The facts incontrovertibly show that Alan Chambers, President of Exodus International, was aware of the list of speakers and abhorrent content prior to the conference. Exodus board member Don Schmierer, who spoke in Uganda, made no objections to the radical and dangerous platform offered. Instead, these mortal threats to the lives of gay and lesbian people were met with a deafening silence. Exodus, in effect, gave this insidious conference its tacit approval.\n \n Today, we take the unprecedented step of joining together to demand that Exodus International's Board of Directors take immediate action to hold accountable those who used the Exodus brand to promote an atmosphere conducive to serious human rights abuses. The accountability must begin with reasonable and responsible action by Board Chair Bob Ragan, including:\n  * Dismissing Exodus President Alan Chambers for his knowing role in using Exodus to promote human rights abuses\n * Removing Board member Don Schmierer for speaking at a hate conference that promotes physical harm and psychological torture against GLBT people\n * Boldly articulating Exodus' policy against human rights abuses including forced therapy\n * Promising to end future participation in all conferences that call on the persecution and criminalization of gay and lesbian people\n We do not take this call to action lightly. These steps are necessary and commensurate with the massive breach of ethics and trust by the Exodus leadership. Clearly, Exodus has lost credibility and its claim to \"love\" gay people in the aftermath of Uganda seems duplicitous and insincere. As long as Chambers and Schmierer remain at Exodus, the organization is hopelessly compromised and even complicit in grave human rights abuses. It is time for the Exodus Board, led by Bob Ragan, to assert its moral authority by appointing new leadership and taking the organization in a more humane and principled direction.\n And later in the article (after the letter)...It is not the first time forced therapy has become an issue with Exodus International. This issue was raised in 2005 when \"Zach\", a 16-year-old gay teen, was forced against his will to attend an eight-week ex-gay therapy program at Exodus-affiliated Love In Action in Memphis. That same year, another father drove his 17-year-old son to Love In Action in handcuffs. Despite all this, Love In Action remains one of Exodus' most prominent member ministries. Today, the calls for enshrining forced therapy into Ugandan law has been met with silence at Exodus. We call upon Exodus once and for all to address the morality of forcing people into unregulated and unproven therapies against their will.Open letter to the Exodus International Board of Directors | Ex-Gay Watch\n \n In recent years, Exodus International chose to renew its membership in the Exodus Global Alliance, knowing that the EGA was acting to condemn gay people in Jamaica, Barbados, Uganda and elsewhere to years of imprisonment, torture, and vigilante violence. Exodus leaders have chosen to re-associate with Lively through illicit promotion of his Holocaust revisionism; and Exodus has chosen to re-associate not only with same-sex sexual-cuddle and tennis-racket therapy advocate Richard Cohen, but now with Cohen's ex-gay foundation witchdoctor, Caleb Lee Brundidge, who is said to perform tribal magic rituals - dressed in a veneer of pentecostal language - upon would-be ex-gays.Truth Wins Out - Exodus Leader Gives Nod for Ugandan Gays to Be Forced into Ex-Gay Therapy\n \n I am reminded of all the empty mewling that the \"ex-gay\" and \"reparative therapy\" groups do trying to whine about how ex-gays are not given respect or tolerance.\n If this conference had instead said that ex-gays were responsible for that holocaust, do you think these Exodus people would be there?\n Or would they be loudly renouncing the association?\n \n To lend credibility to such statements by speaking at the same conference as these people is abominable. Exodus International was obviously be a major presence at this \"conference\".\n I tried searching the Exodus international web-site to see if they had any comment on the Uganda conference. \n No mention. Even searching for just \"Uganda\" gave one hit with no relevance to this issue.\n I find the absence of commentary a little surprising since they aren't even acknowledging that Exodus International had representation at this Uganda conference.\n \n The \"ex-gay\" ministry is showing their true colors here. I have repeatedly stated in the past that the \"ex-gay\" ministry's interests are not truly centered on HELPING homosexuals. To ignore the type of damage they do, misrepresent their \"success\" rates, and to associate themselves repeatedly with efforts to discriminate against gays?\n It's all a clear trend.",

Usaam Mukwaaya was on his way back from Friday prayers when he was stopped by a police patrol car and taken off a motorbike taxi that he had hired to transport him.\n \n Three men in police uniform and a fourth in civilian attire put Mukwaaya in the patrol car. He was driven to a building where he was led through a dark hall to an interrogation room, and aggressively questioned about the Ugandan LGBT movement. Mukwaaya was cut around the hands and tortured with a machine that applies extreme pressure to the body, preventing breathing and causing severe pain.\n \n Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG)--a coalition of 3 LGBTI organizations in Uganda--and the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC) searched unsuccessfully for Mukwaaya from 3:00 p.m. on July 25 to the morning of July 26, 2008, inquiring as to his whereabouts at five police stations in Kampala. On July 26, 2008, at about 11:40 a.m., Mukwaaya was driven from the building where he'd been held for about 30 to 45 minutes and dumped. Shaken and bruised, he boarded a motorbike taxi to the city center and telephoned colleagues from SMUG who found him weak, filthy and without shoes and some of his clothing.\n \n IGLHRC and SMUG have documented a pattern of abuse against LGBT people in Uganda. In the past five years, the government has arrested LGBT people on sodomy charges, harassed LGBT human rights defenders, and fined a private radio station that broadcast programming on HIV prevention and men who have sex with men. In July 2005, Uganda's Parliament passed an amendment to the constitution making Uganda only the second country in the world to use its constitution to outlaw marriage between people of the same sex. A coalition of religious leaders has marched through the streets of Kampala demanding the arrests of LGBT people with one cleric even calling for the \"starving to death\" of homosexuals. Inspired by the official homophobia of the state, the Ugandan media has published lists of gay men and lesbians, leading to physical violence, loss of employment and educational opportunities by LGBT people.\n \n On June 4, 2008, Mukwaaya and two other human rights defenders, Pepe Julian Onziema and Valentine Kalende, were arrested while peacefully attending the 2008 HIV/AIDS Implementers Meeting in Kampala. They were charged with criminal trespass, a case that is ongoing in the courts. The arrest of the activists has been condemned by local and international organizations, including UNAIDS and the U.S. government, both of which were organizers of the conference. Media attention related to the trial and the strong international condemnation of the arrests may be the cause of the arrest of Usaam Mukwaaya and continued harassment of LGBT activists.\n\n Ugandan Police Arrest and Torture Gay Activist",

   "Jyoshu????\n Have you even tried to research how gays are treated in Uganda???\n Have you made ANY effort on your own to try and look into this situation at all???\n \n Here's another story on Ugandan civil rights abuses against gays.\n :xbanghead\n Jyoshu, if you want to LEARN about this you have the capability to.\n\n \n And there you have it ... a classic example of one of Foundit's moving of goalposts; right on schedule.\n \n Foundit, NO one is saying there aren't human rights abuses in Uganda against gays. If you had bothered to actually READ what I took issue with rather than just reacting or misrepresenting, you'd know I was taking issue with blindly accepting some of the STATEMENTS that are being made that need to be accompanied with proof, (as they are extremely implicatory). It's like a couple of ideologues decided to say on a blog \"a poster known as Foundit said that black people should really go back to being slaves.\" And then someone else coming along and expecting people to take that at face value. It's being claimed that ...\n \n \"prominent members of the ex-gay organization Exodus International participated last week in a conference in Uganda that promoted ...draconian measures against gay and lesbian people such as forced ex-gay therapy, life imprisonment for people convicted of homosexuality\"\n \n Let's LOOK at what's basically being accused here by a small number of gay activists regarding STATEMENTS at the CONFERENCE--not actions of the GOVERNMENT, because it needs to be broken down past hyperbole and RHETORIC.\n \n - conference promoted life sentences on gays\n - conference promoted FORCING ex-gay therapy\n - That gays were blamed for Nazism\n - That gays were blamed for 1994 Rwanda\n - Other accusations ...\n \n These are statements claiming that given things were SAID. No one is taking issue with the idea that Uganda is anti-gay and engages in human rights abuses, so stop tying to distract here. Uganda is not unlike a lot of African countries in this regard; Regarding knowing about abuses there, I've been to East Africa myself multiple times and I've actually seen plenty of abuses firsthand there, as well as CLEARLY the homophobic culture in several of the countries there. (I didn't specifically enter Uganda, but it's part of a broader homophobic culture throughout much of Africa--it's certainly not an isolated case in this regard.) My suspicion is that you haven't, and that all you go on is what you read posted or emphasized on gay pride websites. So don't give me your faux \"you-need-to-learn\" junk. I've likely done more to SEE human rights abuses in Africa than you ever have.\n \n On an observational note, I find it interesting that one of the things complained of was the \"publicly identifying private LGBT citizens\". Yet the gay rights movement seems to have no problem publicly identifying people for supporting prop 8 here in the states knowing full well the volatile and incendiary atmosphere right after its passage.",

   "And there you have it ... a classic example of one of Foundit's moving of goalposts; right on schedule.\n Foundit, NO one is saying there aren't human rights abuses in Uganda against gays.\n\n Your obfuscation is pointless at this stage.\n You are skeptical for the sake of being skeptical on a gay rights issue.\n \n You labelled these claims as \"outlandish\" and THAT is the point of me posting the above. There is no \"moving the goal-posts\". I am proving how ridiculous your \"outlandish\" claim is because the things put forth in that article, from those eye-witnesses, ARE PERFECTLY IN KEEPING with the treatment of gays in the area.\n NOTHING they said was actually \"outlandish\".\n \n It's like somebody said \"I saw a nazi conference, and they talked about imprisoning Jews.\" Jyoshu comes along and points out that the person making the claim is a Jewish rights activist. Jyoshu complains that only a couple of people have made such a complaint.\n Of course, the fact that the conference description is perfectly in keeping with the area is meaningless to Jyoshu.\n \n I offer another story to show how another country in Africa treats gays. It's a little farther south than Uganda, but this is just further proof that there is nothing \"outlandish\" here...\n \n \nA report by the international NGO ActionAid, backed by the South African Human Rights Commission, said the horrific crimes against lesbians were going unrecognised by the state and unpunished by the legal system.\n \n The report called for South Africa's criminal justice system to recognise the rapes as hate crimes in an attempt to force police to take action over the rising tide of violence. \n \n The ferocity of the attack became clear in April last year when Eudy Simelane, former star of South Africa's national female football squad, became one of the victims. Miss Simelane, and equality rights campaigner and one of the first women to live openly as a lesbian, was gang-raped and brutally beaten before being stabbed 25 times in the face, chest and legs.\n \n But scores more women have been deliberately targeted for rape, the Guardian reports.\n \n \"Every day I am told that they are going to kill me, that they are going to rape me and after they rape me I'll become a girl,\" Zakhe Sowello from Soweto, told the paper. \"When you are raped you have a lot of evidence on your body. But when we try and report these crimes nothing happens, and then you see the boys who raped you walking free on the street.\"\n \n Research shows 86 per cent of black lesbians from the Western Cape live in fear of sexual assault. Triangle, a gay rights organisation, said it deals with up to 10 new cases of \"corrective rape\" every week. \n\n Lesbians subjected to \"corrective rape\" in South Africa - Telegraph\n \n Will Jyoshu find some excuse to doubt the claims of this \"Triangle, a gay rights organization\" group?\n Somehow, I'm beyond caring.\n Somehow, I doubt lions existed in Roman times.... emoticon_xdonno",
