   "Here are the exact numbers:\n \n \"Top 5% - 56.47% of all income taxes \n Top 10% - 67.33% of all income taxes \n Top 25% - 84.01% of all income taxes. \n Top 50% - 96.09% of all income taxes. \n The bottom 50%? They pay a paltry 3.91% of all income taxes.\" \n \n \"The top 1% is paying more than ten times the federal income taxes than the bottom 50%! And who earns what? The top 1% earns 20.81% of all income. The top 5% earns 35.30% of the pie. The top 10% earns 46.01%; the top 25% earns 67.15%, and the top 50% earns 87.01% of all the income.\"\n \n www.rushlimbaugh.com --<excellent site!\n\n \n \n I just have one quick comment/concern before I expose my plan on a new tax system which will one day make me President (I'll have to wait 15 years until I am eligible to run). If the top 50% of the US population is paying 96% of all the income taxes, shouldn't they get more out of it? Someone who pays $1000 a year in taxes gets the exact same things (roads, libraries, police and fire protection) as someone who pays $25 million in taxes. Bill Gates get the exact same stuff from the government as does someone who workds at Taco Bell. How can you argue to raise taxes on the rich when they don't even benefit at all from it? That is basically telling Bill Gates \"Hey Bill. You're taxes are paying the welfare and salaries of 5000 people because they can't get a job.\" He gets nothing out of it. It's like charging a poor person $.10 for a Pepsi and then charging someone who makes $100 million a year $20. I do not think there should be a flat tax, however I think the higher tax brackets are way too high. Now I will go into my plan to win the Presidential Election of 2020.\n \n I'm sure most of you are familiar with a bell curve. My plan is to design a curve, somewhat similar to a bell curve (slightly different in shape). This way, people who don't make a lot of money won't pay too high in taxes, people who make around $75k-$110k will pay a slightly higher amount, and those who make over that will pay a higher percentage. However, once you get to a certain point, the percentages will begin to decrease. For instance, say I make $450k a year. Say the point at which the tax rate begins to decrease it $275k. Under my plan, I would pay the taxes up to $275k, then the remaining portion of my money I won't pay as much in taxes. I think this will benefit everyone because the rich will still pay more than the poor, however it isn't an arm and a leg. When I am elected, you all can say you read my posting on here.",

At that point, money is just a bunch of numbers tended to by bean counters and tax lawyers. Gates has professed to giving the majority of his fortune to his trust charity, which he's in the process of accomplishing. With an annual after-tax income of $1.2 billion, who cares about taxes? Divide your own after-tax income into that number to get a better idea of how much money it actually is. \n \n Find the average income for the top 20% of wealth and see what they pay. It'll usually come out to about one-third of income, cheap compared to holding off the unwashed on your own.\n \n You're still subject to US income tax if you retain your citizenship, regardless of where your income is derived. It differs, but the obligation is still there. \n \n Individuals and corporate officers move their companies offshore to increase profits by avoiding bloated US wages, benefits and expensive government regulation. Their personal incomes don't affect those decisions other than the consideration of protecting and increasing those incomes. I suggest you get over the idea of protecting the poor, they aren't a factor in business decisions unless they provide labor. \n \n US GDP growth is currently driven by government and personal spending facilitated by debt. Look at our trade imbalance if you want an image of our lack of industrial capacity at competitive prices in a world economy.. We're in the process of becoming a service economy from our former lofty peak of being king of the industrial world.

Again, you are failing to look at the bigger picture. You really think that $100 billion is going to go to help unemployed folks or poor people? Dream on.

Then what country was it that has been running all over the world the last few decades installing and supporting tyrants in positions of power all over the world? Who was it that has been attaching predatory trade restrictions to humanitaian aid packages? They sure looked like Americans to me.\n \n Your last sentence here pretty much highlights your maturity level. Where are the guys like Broker and Ghost when you need them? They actually give me hope for th future of America. Under 18 (I think Broker is actually only 15) but very mature and intelligent for their age. We see the exact opposite here.\n \n Why would you thnk that re-electing Bush woud upset me? I am a registered republican. Personally, I don't care who is elected. The two parties have come so close idealogically that it is incredibly difficult to ascertain the difference between them. I have been challenging the Bush supporters and the Kerry supporters here for months to explain the major idealogical differences between them, and no one has stepped to the plate yet.\n \n The biggest difference does seem to be in their views on taxation. Kerry want to give the middle class a tax break and raise taxes on the extremely wealthy (those who make several hundred millions of dollars per year). I couldn't care less about this. He is not talking a big enough break for the middle class for it to make any real difference on an individual level, and he is not talking enough of a tax hike on the extremely wealthy to make any real individual difference there, either. \n \n \nI am pretty close to knowing everything.

I would rather have a high school dropout with 10 years of experience in their field than some wet behind the ears kid just out of college. \n \n I think the problem is that people graduate from college and think \"gee, I really accomplished something here!\".

This is the kind of thing that makes me want to wander around the local college campus smacking people on the back of the head and yelling \"What the (explicative) are you thinking!\" It is like people tunr 18 and go \"GREAT, credit cards!

It didn;t really happen until I looked at my own education and realised that nothing I had learned in college was really helping me much in the real world.

I have set myself up now probably better than 99.9% of kids my age. The starting salary after college for a business graduate in the honors program I am in is $70,000. So I would say I am in pretty good shape. The company I work for will also pay for my MBA, so I have a pretty good investment not only in my education, but financially as well.\n \n \nI am not knocking you here, I just don't understand what kind of thought processes lead young people to do this kind of thing.

Car loads\" It is a race to see how quickly they can bury themselves in debt.\n\n \n Once again that is true. Many teens have this misconception about credit cards. I was taught by my father and mother, both investment bankers, the pros and cons of loans and credit cards. Fortunately I learned from this and never made the same mistakes many other teens have made.\n \n \n \nYes, most jobs that require a college degree do so to ensure that their newly hired employees can read an perform mathematic calculations at an 8th grade level. Sad, but true. That really says something about the failings of the American education system. I love to hear college kids bemoan how difficult colege is, especially when 12 hours is considered a full course load.\n\n \n I don't agree with you here. Obviously if you have a high school degree, you can read and do math at an 8th grade level, since you obviously passed 8th grade. I forget the exact figures, but college grads average over $750,000 in their lifetime than just high school grads. High school grads have no idea about the real world. They have been at home all their lives and have never been away from home for extended periods of time. On the other hand, college grads have been away from home for 4 years and know what is like not being able to depend directly on mommy and daddy. They also have a MUCH better education that high school grads. College when you were in college is totally different from college nowadays, at least if you go to a worthwhile university. I have taken at least 15 credit hours each semester. However, 15 credit hour is much more than 15 hours worth of time dedicated to school. For every credit hour spent in class, you usually spend and hour out of class studying. So that's nearly 30 a week. Plus they have to deal with having lives outside of school too.\n \n \n \n \nNo, assuming the high school dropout is intelligent to beguin with, they will continue to learn and the college grad, who spent several years at an institute of higher learning will never catch up. Having spent a great deal of time in college myself, it took me a long time to figure this out. It didn;t really happen until I looked at my own education and realised that nothing I had learned in college was really helping me much in the real world.

I think the problem is that it takes so long to really work new principals into a college curriculem that by the time you get out, you are 4-8 years behind the rest of the world.\n\n \n Maybe you went to a worthless college. So a degree from Harvard or Yale is worthless compared to a high school grad? Come on, give me a break. Just because you didn't get anything out of it doesn't mean you need to put the institution down. How many CEOs of noteworthy corporations do you know who didn't go to college? The only ones with no college education or college drop outs are usually tech people, mainly because they can teach the stuff to themselves and have been using a computer for 12 hours a day (i.e. Bill Gates and Paul Allen). Other than that, a lawyer, doctor, investment banker-basically anyone other than a truck driver or garbage man-needs some college education or they will be lost when they get a job in their field.\n \n \n \nIn reality, I probably should have dropped out of college, or at least quite when my initial hitch was up. I missed my first graduation because I was selling a company I had started, and missed my second because I was purchasing a company to compliment the business I started after selling the first.

Hope that makes you feel like an *** emoticon_confused \n\n \n See, now I am pondering something else. Why would you lie to perfect strangers online? I could understand lying to people you know, but not to strangers. Further up the page you specifically stated that you were paying off a car loan. You were using this as an example of how you live in the real world. you said:\n \n \nI am 1500 miles from home, by myself, paying my own rent, own car loan on a new 2004 Corvette Z06, and basically doing everything on my own. So for your information, I am doing pretty damn good in the s0-called \"real world\". \n \n \n Now, all of a sudden, you payed cash for the car with money from a job at a major brokerage house. Now, we know you are only 20, which means that you would have taken this alleged internship before you were 18. This is not possible. Brokerage houses have to be bonded, and no bonding company is going to bond interns who are not even 18. Some will allow 18 yr old interns, but most require interns to be 21 or older. The whole \"21\" thing is, IMHO rediculous, but I suppose it has to do with the whole responsibility thing. Bonding companies require that you be 18 so they can have you thrown in jail and seize your assets (present and future) in the even you are busted stealing. I called my broker to make sure of this. he would like to know what office you worked out of, since granting an internship to somebody under 18 would be an offense worthy of termination. He did say that they allowed high school kids sign on to be an office page (somebody who answers phones and takes out the trash). \n \n \n \n \nI agree that most kids think that way. However, I am not stupid enough to get myself in that situation. I just don't see how you came to the conclusion that I was the same, maybe you were just jealous.\n\n \n No, I came to that conclusion based on the fact that higer up in the thread, you had said you were paying the note on a brand new vette. For some inexplicable reason, you came back and later lied about the vette being paid for (perhaps because the statement you made abovew which was meant to impress simply highlighted your ignorance). Later, you claimed to have held a job that nobody who has ever dealt with a bonding company would possibly believe you have held.\n \n \n \nChances are I won't ever be behing in life. I have set myself up now probably better than 99.9% of kids my age. The starting salary after college for a business graduate in the honors program I am in is $70,000. So I would say I am in pretty good shape. The company I work for will also pay for my MBA, so I have a pretty good investment not only in my education, but financially as well.\n\n \n That is great. Hopefully by then, you will have learned about the benifits of taxation, including the fact that they go beyond percieved public services. I would have thought you would have learned this already, but maybe Columbia isn't the school it once was.\n \n \n \n \nOnce again that is true. Many teens have this misconception about credit cards. I was taught by my father and mother, both investment bankers, the pros and cons of loans and credit cards. Fortunately I learned from this and never made the same mistakes many other teens have made.\n \n \n \n This is good.\n \n \n \n \nI don't agree with you here. Obviously if you have a high school degree, you can read and do math at an 8th grade level, since you obviously passed 8th grade. I forget the exact figures, but college grads average over $750,000 in their lifetime than just high school grads. High school grads have no idea about the real world. They have been at home all their lives and have never been away from home for extended periods of time. On the other hand, college grads have been away from home for 4 years and know what is like not being able to depend directly on mommy and daddy. They also have a MUCH better education that high school grads. College when you were in college is totally different from college nowadays, at least if you go to a worthwhile university. I have taken at least 15 credit hours each semester. However, 15 credit hour is much more than 15 hours worth of time dedicated to school. For every credit hour spent in class, you usually spend and hour out of class studying. So that's nearly 30 a week. Plus they have to deal with having lives outside of school too.\n\n \n First off, in the course of your studies for your MBA, you will find that this is, in fact, why so many jobes require college degrees. A lot of kids who are functionally illiterate manage to graduate high scholl. It is a much more difficult feat to manage a college degree without picking up the basics of English and mathematics.\n \n I did not say that I prefered wet behind the ears high school kids, I said I preferred a high school dropout with 10 years experience int heir field. There is a big difference. College kids living away from home in the unreality of college life barely count as living ontheir own. Collge campuses, and colleg towns, are protected environments. Anywhere that you get summer vacation is not the real world/\n \n As far as 15 credit hours equaling 30 hrs per week, you are probably right. That is not even equal to a full time job. I have worked 70-80 hrs per week for the last 18 years. Welcome to the real world. I have just reached the point where I can bop off for a month or so at a time to do some sailing or wander around and visit the sites in rome if I so desire. \n \n \n \n \nMaybe you went to a worthless college. So a degree from Harvard or Yale is worthless compared to a high school grad? Come on, give me a break. Just because you didn't get anything out of it doesn't mean you need to put the institution down. How many CEOs of noteworthy corporations do you know who didn't go to college? The only ones with no college education or college drop outs are usually tech people, mainly because they can teach the stuff to themselves and have been using a computer for 12 hours a day (i.e. Bill Gates and Paul Allen). Other than that, a lawyer, doctor, investment banker-basically anyone other than a truck driver or garbage man-needs some college education or they will be lost when they get a job in their field.\n\n \n Actually, the collge I went to was ranked #1 in my field nationwide. It takes 4 years to get a textbook done and into print, so by the time you get your new, shiny text book, the information in it is 4 years out of date. There are several CEOs of large corporations that never went to college. I think the most notable is probably Michael Dell (who last year made more money than bill Gates).\n \n After several years of experience in their field, it is not unusual for people to stop including an education section on their resume. By then, what you have accomplished far outweighs your educational background when it comes to employment eligibility. You would have to be an idiot to look at two resumes, one with real world results on them, and the other with an impressive education but no real world experience, and pick the education over the tangible experience. \n \n There are those who would pick to education over the experience. To my mind, this is an incredibly foolish thing to do. The problem seems to be that management in this country has become a religion, and the ticket for admittance is a college degree. I recently hired a new production manager for my company. Their responsibilties included overseeing day to day operations of the shop, maintaining material supply chains and establishing production goals. The job pays $121,000 per day to start. I got a lot of applicants, but ended up giving the job to one of the guys from the shop, a machinist who had to be pushed to apply for it. Who better to oversee the shop than a machinist who has worked there for several years? Who better to establish and maintain a materials supply cahin than a guy who has spent his whole life working with those materials? Who better to establish production goals and deadlines than a guy who has worked under production deadlines, and met production goals consistently for years?\n \n Most companies hire either an engineer or somebody with an MBA for such a position, and would think twice about giving the job to a machinest, no atter how good he is or how qualified for the position he is. They just don;t feel comfortable handing over control of a 350 million dollar shop to a guy who dropped out of high school when he was 14 to work in an auto repair shop. I have found that he is perfectly suited for the job. The last guy to hold that position was a good guy. He had a degree in Engineering, as well as a business degree. His paperwork was always great, but when a problem arose he didn't always understand the entire scope of the problem. This meant that folks from the shop were constantly ending up in my office (I have a strict open door policy) and I was constantly spending time that should have been devoted to my duties doing my production managers job.\n \n today, I was standing talking to my new production manager, and one of the machine operators came up with a problem. Production manager took a look, listened to the guy explain the problem, then went over and fired up the guys mill and showed him how to handle the situation. This is what I like to see,\n \n Unfortunatly, you will most likely get a job out of college, like the millions of other kids who graduate at the same time. The majority of you will likely rise to mid level manager positions, with a very few rising up the ranks to positions of real responsibility. You will see yourself as the picture of sucess, like millions of other pathetic, wage slave yuppies, and will seek qualitites you find desirable in yourself in your subordinates, thus another generation of ill qualified people whose only real \"qualification\" is a college degree will be in place to take over when you finally retire on social security plus whatever pittance you have managed to sock away in your 401kaput. This will likely give you enough to survive on, but not really enough to live on. \n \n Many people have questioned my methods and approach to hiring, including my refusal to give much (if any) weight to education in my decisions. None can question my results, though. We have experienced consistent growth between 50 and 57 percent every year for the last 11 (for the 3 years before that we were just a startup company and growth was closer to 200%). Other companies that have similar personell management policies in place generally experience similar results. Other companies seem to be learning from this. You are seeing a lot more workplace management training programs coming into place, and many companies are going back to a policy of promoting from within. \n \n \n \nSorry to hear that. I am interested in hearing any more of your comments emoticon_emb\n\n \n Actually, I will most likely put you on my ignore list. I have never \"ignored\" anybody before, as it seems counter productive in a debate forum to do so. I really don't have time to debate nonsensical points with people who, in their very first paragraph, tell two very transparent (and in one case self debunked) lies. Two things I have learned about lying:\n \n 1. You must alway remember what you said earlier\n 2. You must always ensure that either common sense or factual evidence is not readily available to expose the lie.\n \n I learned both of these on the same lie. I showed up at home at 4:00 in the morning drunk as a skunk. My wife asked \"where have you been\". The truth....I was sitting around up at work with a bunch of guys from the shop drinking beer and shooting the breeze. What I told her......I had a flat tire on the way home. I slipped up twice, ocnce in that I calimed at oine point that the flat tire was in the parking lot at work, then later said that it was right down the road from home. Later, my wife pointed out that my spare was a doughnut, and all the tires on the car were full sized.\n \n BUSTED.",

   "Now, all of a sudden, you payed cash for the car with money from a job at a major brokerage house. Now, we know you are only 20, which means that you would have taken this alleged internship before you were 18. This is not possible. Brokerage houses have to be bonded, and no bonding company is going to bond interns who are not even 18. Some will allow 18 yr old interns, but most require interns to be 21 or older. The whole \"21\" thing is, IMHO rediculous, but I suppose it has to do with the whole responsibility thing. Bonding companies require that you be 18 so they can have you thrown in jail and seize your assets (present and future) in the even you are busted stealing. I called my broker to make sure of this. he would like to know what office you worked out of, since granting an internship to somebody under 18 would be an offense worthy of termination. He did say that they allowed high school kids sign on to be an office page (somebody who answers phones and takes out the trash).\n\n \n \n My parents bought me a new Ford Excursion after high school. I sold that and put that with some money I had saved up to buy the Corvette. I paid $50,000 cash and took out a $7,000 loan, which is already paid off (which I said I had already paid off). My high school had a partnership with several companies, and I chose to do mine with Smith Barney. I started when I was 18 and worked Christmas breaks and summers there. I was going to work again this summer, however I got a 7 month internship with CitiGroup in Florida. Obviously at 18 years old I wasn't trading stocks and managing portfolios for SB, however I learned a lot from the internship and put that to work in the stock market.\n \n \n \n \nNo, I came to that conclusion based on the fact that higer up in the thread, you had said you were paying the note on a brand new vette.

Later, you claimed to have held a job that nobody who has ever dealt with a bonding company would possibly believe you have held.\n\n \n Once again (please read), I was an INTERN, not a full-time employee. Two totally different concepts, although it may be hard to understand. And I also stated \"And now I am 20, have ALREADY paid for the whole car (all $57,000 of it).\"\n \n \n \n \nI did not say that I prefered wet behind the ears high school kids, I said I preferred a high school dropout with 10 years experience int heir field. There is a big difference. College kids living away from home in the unreality of college life barely count as living ontheir own. Collge campuses, and colleg towns, are protected environments. Anywhere that you get summer vacation is not the real worl.\n\n \n \n \n And high school is? High school kids live at home, don't pay for anything, and are forced to go to school. They have just as many breaks as college kids. They also live at home. Living in college isn't a protected environment. Over 50% of all kids live off campus (not a protected environment). Maybe all kids lived on campus when you were in college, but that's not how it works today. In college, it's your choice. You get out of college proportionally what you put into it. So a college grad is definitely better; he made it through college and got a degree. That shows that he had some sort of self-discipline and motivation and didn't just waste 4 years of his life.\n \n \n \nAs far as 15 credit hours equaling 30 hrs per week, you are probably right. That is not even equal to a full time job. I have worked 70-80 hrs per week for the last 18 years. Welcome to the real world. I have just reached the point where I can bop off for a month or so at a time to do some sailing or wander around and visit the sites in rome if I so desire.\n\n \n \n I am so happy for you emoticon_xgood That is 30 hours dedicated solely to studies. Most students are in certain honors societies or other organizations, have labs, study groups, or actually have lives outside of school. So college is basically a full time job, at least if you actually plan to graduate on time.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nActually, the collge I went to was ranked #1 in my field nationwide.

I said there are very few CEOs who dropped out of college or didn't go, and the ones that fit this mold are usually tech-savy people. I would consider Michael Dell a tech-savy person. So find a list of some people who are CEOs on notable corporations who didn't go to college. Please, impress me.\n \n \n \nThere are those who would pick to education over the experience.

I hardly believe that considering his duties are very minimal. If it's true, I hope someone who just has a lot of money to throw around offeres me $121,000 a day to whipe their @ss, because I would probably do it.\n \n \n \n \n \nUnfortunatly, you will most likely get a job out of college, like the millions of other kids who graduate at the same time.

Let's hire all the high school dropouts, drunks, and whinos because they are more qualified. You make absolutely no sense in your brutal comments.
