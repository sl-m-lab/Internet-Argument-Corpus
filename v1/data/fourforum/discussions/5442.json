   "\n ...a man reaps what he sows.\n\n \n The bible states you reap what you sow but in the story of Christianity that is false. Christianity, as expressed in the salvation scheme, is based on reaping more or less than what you sow, and not on any fair, impartial measure. \n \n Unless one believes a very narrow, specific thing, all the seeds one plants will lead to fallow ground. Conversely, all one needs to do is profess a certain belief and the bountiful rewards of reaping greatly exceed what was sown. The salvation plan is by no means fair in that regard.\n \n As an example, Bob lives a honest life, steadily working, paying his bills in a timely manner, contributing to society in a small but beneficial way. He loves his wife and children, and has been a good neighbor, but cannot for the life of him believe the Christian story. According to that story, Bob will definitely not reap the fruits of his sowing.\n \n Joe, meanwhile, is particularly ill-tempered and has been arrested for armed robbery and rape. He has been a continual burden on society, yet on his deathbed confesses that he fully believes the Christian story. According to the story, he is now going to reap much more than he ever sowed.\n \n Why would the bible proclaim this if the writer (I believe it was Paul) understood what the salvation plan entailed? Why do we allow Christians to utter this often-repeated saying and not call them on it?",

The law of sowing and reaping, as you gave it, should have be given in context with the rest of Jesus' teachings, including his eternal plan of salvation. But generally speaking, if you work hard you'll reap a harvest. If you sow evil you'll reap evil (hell) in the end, even if that doesn't happen until the Judgment.

   "Billsco\n \n Here's something that might help also. I think it best to place in proper context the significance of works as it relates to salvation (justification) and rewards, which is most clearly expressed in I Corinthians 3:11-15:\n \n \"For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw, his work will be shown for what it is, because the day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man's work. If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward. If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames.\" \n \n \n The Full Life Study Bible provides these remarks on the above passage: \n \n \"HE WILL SUFFER LOSS: There is a future judgment for believers (I John 4:17) as to the degree of their faithfulness to God and the grace given to them during this life on earth (v.10; 4:2-5; 2 Cor.5:10). In that judgment there is the possibility that a believer, although receiving salvation, may experience great loss (Greek zemloo, meaning 'to suffer loss or damage'). The careless believer is in danger of suffering loss or damage in the following ways: (1) a feeling of shame at Christ's coming (2 Ti. 2:15; 1 John 2:28); (2) loss of his or her life's work for God (vv. 12-15); (3) loss of glory and honor before God (cf. Romans 2:7); (4) loss of opportunity for service and authority in heaven (Mt. 25:14-30); (5) a low position in heaven (Mt. 25:14-30); (6) loss of rewards (cf. v. 14-15); and (7) repayment for the wrong done to others (Col. 3:24-25).\n \n AS ONE ESCAPING THROUGH THE FLAMES:  'Escaping through the flames' is probably an expression meaning 'barely saved.' God will evaluate the quality of life, influence, teaching, and work in the church of each person. If his work is judged unworthy, he will lose his (heavenly) reward, yet he himself will be saved.\" ( Full Life 1755-56)\n \n Godly works do not result in justification, but are directed towards the edification and salvation of others, and eventually result in some type of heavenly rewards. For those who may have been saved just prior to death (the thief on the cross), there may not be any works to reward, yet their salvation is yet assured. It is my contention that once a person is regenerated, eventually, if they live long enough, there should be some sort of Godly works in their life (James chapter 2).",

   "Easyrider,\n \n Please don't link to any more articles that drone on to infinity. I really prefer for you to argue your point in your own words, using bible passages if necessary to support any contentions. I read your linked articles this time but now I don't know who to respond to, you or the authors of the articles. If this is your M.O. I think it's only fair for me to link to pieces of my choosing which I will expect you to read, absorb, and respond to. \n \n That said, I find the thinking behind the articles abhorrent. Somehow heaven is a very segregated place, where a careless believer (whatever that is) will occupy a low place in heaven; the hovels and slums across the tracks. The high rises on Snob Hill will be occupied by those who did the heavy lifting for God. Of course, heavy lifting means those who went the extra mile for God-for instance, the Christian crusaders who smashed in the skulls of the Muslim infidels. That's the kind of action which gets one a penthouse, a rare accomplishment these days. It's doubtful that simply typing responses and linking articles to a lowly infidel on the internet counts as heavy lifting. \n \n And then there's this gem: \n \n \"This next verse tells us that God will reward some of us a hundredfold for having to leave family and friends in order to go to work for Him.\"\n \n Imagine, a special reward for abandoning your wife and kids. The author tells us-in a straight face-that this life is over in a blink of an eye. One's real priority therefore is to make sure all efforts are toward ensuring YOU store up YOUR heavenly rewards. Obviously the wifey and kids can store their own rewards, this is all about YOU.\n \n And what is the reward according to the author? A crown. Yes that's right, you get to wear a bejeweled crown on your head which distinguishes you in heaven from, say, the careless believer who stayed with and supported his family. He'll be crownless and get the key to some rundown, rat-infested hovel in the shadows of the sleek high-rises. \n \n It's enough to make me want to set up a T-Shirt business at the pearly gates. \"I did the heavy lifting for God and all I got was this lousy crown.\" \n \n This place called heaven, as imagined by the articles you linked to, is beginning to sound terrible. It also reinforces in a powerful way my assertion that one doesn't reap what ones sows when it comes to the Christian scheme of things.",
