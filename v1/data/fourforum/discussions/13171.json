   "The Texas State Board of Education review committee is preparing to vote on a draft of proposed standards for history textbooks. Noting that the draft has \"nothing about liberals,\" the Houston Chronicle reported: \n The first draft for proposed standards in United States History Studies Since Reconstruction says students should be expected \"to identify significant conservative advocacy organizations and individuals, such as Newt Gingrich, Phyllis Schlafly and the Moral Majority.\" [...] Others have proposed adding talk show host Rush Limbaugh and the National Rifle Association.\n The 15-member committee, stacked with 10 Republicans, is expected to vote along party lines. Earlier this year, a panel of right-wing \"experts\" produced a report urging the committee to remove biographies of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Stephen F. Austin, and C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, and instead add history about the \"motivational role the Bible and the Christian faith played in the settling of the original colonies.\"\n\n Think Progress Texas to revise history textbooks: liberals out, Limbaugh and Gingrich in.\n \n So we remove info about George Washington, but include a requirement for Rush Limbaugh???\n \n Have they done lost their minds???? emoticon_frazzled",

In college (early 90's), my second-term U.S. history prof noted that it would be really difficult for him to maintain \"the historian's objectivity\" near the end of the course, because he lived through the 50's and 60's, and even we students were around during the 70's and 80's. The times being discussed were too recent to know what was truly important or not, and what's merely colored one way or the other by the subjectivity of memory. He warned us to take everything he said with a grain of salt -- and even to take a few things we thought we knew with a grain of salt, as well.\n \n Of course, my high school history class ended at World War II.... Gosh, what a bad history teacher I had then.\n \n But in any event, here's what I'm curious about<b></b>: What are the main items of post-Vietnam history that should be discussed in a high school history book? What people and events should be discussed? What long trends or broad patterns need attention? And what people and events whom we might find important should be subsumed under those larger phenomena, rather than dealt with in their own right?\n \n Like I said, just curious.",
