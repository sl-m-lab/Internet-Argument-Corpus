   "Well, im new here, havnt seen this thread yet, if there is one im sorry bbut i havnt seen one.\n \n Anyways, its clear to me, since London was bombed today(July 08 2005), that we should get OUT of Iraq and friggin find Osama. Since Bush \"claimed\" that iraq had wmd(weapons of mass destruction) we have neglected to look for and find Osama Bin Ladin. To me, if all of the UK hates the US, I personaly wouldnt blame them. If we wouldve stuck to the first damn thing Bush said then London might not have been bombed. I mean cmon, we claim that we \"know\" were Osama is, but if that was true, dont you think we wouldve done something? I mean I know I wouldve, and I know a lot of other people who would as well. It is in my opinion that we impeech Bush because he bombed London indirectly with no provocation. Well, i just want to hear you guys' thoughts on this subject because I KNOW there are a lot of people out there who either agree, disagree, or mildy agree with this statement. Also, I know many of you will get extremly mad at me for this post, considering more than half of the public are Bush's bitches(no offence). All of the above post is my opinion and if you disagree with me, let me hear your thoughts, I love to argue and will humbly accept any debate challenge anyways wants to give me. Thanks, and have a nice day.",

Also I would advise you to add in a coherent sentence now and then in your post, it would be a bit easier to read. Although I generally agree with what you say, you could write it so it's easier to understand. If you could avoid phrases such as \"I mean, cmon\", things you say when you talk, it would be a lot easier to read. You also just sort of ramble on, the periods seem to be randomly placed, you never know when your thought will end.\n \n I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just trying to help you to hopefully make a post that is a bit better to read and may encourage other people to read it. You put a few good thoughts down, but you seem to have a bit of trouble expressing them. Would I be right if I guessed that you are a kid still in school?",

   "1. What does catching OBL have to do with stopping global terrorism?\n 2. How would withdrawing troops from Iraq improve our intellegence on AQ?\n\n how about attacks like the one that occured in london wouldnt have occured. catching bin laden would have prevented that. disabling al qaeda would have prevented that. we are not in the process of catching bin laden nor eliminating any terrorist organizations. none. we are imposing our ideals upon iraq, and nothing else\n \n \nWell, didn't the bombings in London prove that the war on terror is working? ;) :p\n\n no offence, but this is truly one of the most thoughtless statements i have ever read concerning the war in iraq. if by \"working\" you mean making ourselves and our allies more vulnerable to terrorist attacks, then your definition of \"working\" is very wierd. we claim to be at war with terror. yet we are not dismantling any terrorist organizations whatsoever. we are not capturing or even effectively pursuing the source of the terrorist threats and attacks. we are not intercepting attack plans. we are not reducing terrorist recruitment and training. we are not denying terrorist operatives getting materials, information, funds or mobility. so WHAT are we doing?",

   "Osama bin Laden is not the only terrorist in the world! And you seem to think that we completely forgot about him when we went to Iraq. You're wrong. We are still hunting for him, the pronblem is that it's in one of the worst landscapes on the face of the globe.\n\n osama is the primary terrorist, in that he successfully targetted and killed americans on american soil, and demonstrates constantly that he is willing and able to do so again. and we did forget about him when we went to iraq. bush himself said so. he doesnt know where bin laden is, and he really doesnt care.\n \n \nZarqawi and al-Qaeda in Iraq are not Iraqi! Most of the terrorists/insurgents/fighters in Iraq are NOT FROM IRAQ!!!! The majority of Iraqis, the Shi'ites, are not fighting the Americans.\n\n so why exactly are we in war with iraq?\n \n \nBy this point I'm firmly convinced that you're not even comprehending what I'm saying. I don't think you're stupid or anything, not at all, I just don't think you're actually reading what I'm writing. We're talking first of all about two entirely different things; we were talking about immigration and the refusal of immigrants to assimilate. You're talking about Americanizing Iraq. We're not trying to export American culture to the Middle East, we're trying to allow the Iraqi people their OWN society.\n\n we are doing exactly that: imposing our ideals on iraq. we think its best for iraq to be a democracy, so we establish a democracy there. our establishing a democracy in iraq will do nothing but enrage the already american-hating muslim fundamentalists, giving them local and easily accessible targets in iraq. what we are effectively doing is painting a bullseye on iraq for the terrorists. they are not going to stop hating america or believing in the cause of their jihad. they are not going to be awestruck by the american-regulated prosperity of iraq and welcome them as economically viable neighbors. this is the lie that bush is selling to america and iraq. terrorists leaders arent stupid or gullible. luckily for bush, americans seem to be",

I, however, do not fear Osama, or any other terrorist group. I fear the actions of our incapable president. He keeps provoking people over and over again. Its like hes trying to impress his dad since his dad ended the cold war. Soon, itll be wold war 3, but the allies will be the USA, Brittan, and maybe some other palces, vs everyone else.
