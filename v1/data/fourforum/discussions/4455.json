   "Are you a Secular Humanist?\n\n Quite possibly. There was a test on the internet that rated agreement with various philosophical/religious positions.

I personally object to abortion but it is not my right to control another.\n \nDo you support the posting of the Ten Commandments in courthouses?\n\n No. The Constitution prohibits the government from endorsing or supporting religion. Government should apply equally to all citizens and residents and not favor or support any particular faith.\n \nDo you support a constitutional amendment to guarantee the equal rights of women?\n\n No. Simply because I think that our constitution already does guarantee them equal rights.\n \nDo you support the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would prohibit employers from dismissing gay and lesbian employees because of their sexual orientation?\n\n Yes.\n \nPhilosophically:\n \n Do you feel working to benefit society maximizes individual happiness?\n\n Yes.\n \nDo you think knowledge of the world is derived from divine revelation as opposed to observation, experimentation and rational analysis?\n\n No.\n \nDo you think that revent is an acceptable motive for the punishment of crime and national involvement in global conflict?\n\n No. I presume you meant revenge.\n \nDo you think that people should be treated equally regardless of their ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation?\n\n Yes.\n \nDo you hold to ethical principles that do not rely on religious dogma?\n\n Yes.",

   "Keep your religion out of the buildings I help pay for with my secular tax money.\n\n \n I think the secular humanists have yet to grasp the difference between an \"establishment of religion\" and the \"acknowledgment / free exercise thereof\".\n \n The \"establishment\" of religion argument used by the liberal left is a misnomer. \n \n First, the Constitution identifies Congress as the specific body in the clause (\"Congress shall make no law...\"). The liberals have extrapolated this to include any and all bodies of government, public schools, etc., arguing that the mere mention of God, whether in historical context or whatever, constitues an establishment of a particular religion. That's nuts.\n \n Second, in \"U.S. Supreme Court ABINGTON SCHOOL DIST. v. SCHEMPP, 374 U.S. 203 (1963) it was noted that, \"We agree of course that the State may not establish a \"religion of secularism\" in the sense of affirmatively opposing or showing hostility to religion, thus \"preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe.\" Zorach v. Clauson, supra, at 314. \n \n Third, Congress shall also make no laws restricting the \"free exercise of\" (religion). With paid Congressional chaplains, reliefs of the Ten Commandments in the Supreme Court, a Congressional Bible previously printed and paid for by Congress, and hundreds of other examples, modern day liberals have gone off the deep end with their failed \"establishment\" arguments. God is a historical reality in the founding of America, and no amount of secular revisionism is going to change that. \n \n Why has there been a Senate Chaplain and a House Chaplain on the Congressional payroll since 1789?\n \n The Senate and House Chaplain positions were started, and placed on the government payroll, by those (same individuals) who wrote the constitution and the bill of rights, including the so called, \"establishment\" clause of the first amendment. They (the Chaplains) are paid to pray to God in Congress, give spiritual counsel, and teach bible studies. Does this sound like the founding fathers wanted church separated from government? Evidently, the founding fathers had a different understanding of the \"establishment clause\" than today's secular humanists, who have taken the law into their own hands. \n \n \"What is an establishment of religion? It must have a creed defining what a man must believe; it must have rites and ordinances which believers must observe; it must have ministers of defined qualifications to teach the doctrines and administer the rites; it must have tests for the submissive penalties for the nonconformist. There never was an established religion without all these - - -\n \n James Madison who is called, the \"Chief Architect of the Constitution\": proposed the following wording for the establishment clause of the First Amendment, \"The civil rights of none shall be abridged on account of religious belief or worship, nor shall any national religion be established,\"\n \n http://www.usorthem.org/current-events/pledge_of_allegiance.html\n \n Finally, even after Thomas Jefferson coined his Danbury \"Wall of Separation\" letter, he attended church services in government buildings, and did so for the remainder of his term. Obviously he also must have had a different take on the Establishment Clause than do modern-day secularists.",

The liberals have extrapolated this to include any and all bodies of government, public schools, etc., arguing that the mere mention of God, whether in historical context or whatever, constitues an establishment of a particular religion. That's nuts.\n\n Are you posting such disinformation because you are deceptive or because you are ignorant?\n \n I suspect it is the later because you are so dedicated to imposing your religion on everyone. First, there are two clauses dealing with freedom of religion. Both the Establishment and the Free Exercise Clauses, by their terms, restrict legislative action by Congress. However, both clauses have been interpreted by the Supreme Court to apply also to the states, by means of the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. Therefore, whether the government action in question is federal or state, the same standards apply to each.\n \n The Fourteenth Amendment was, of course, passed by Congress and ratified by the required number of states. Further, the incorporation of the First Amendment under the due process clause was a decision of the Supreme Court.\n \n Not sure why you think that liberal extrapolation has anything to do with it. Perhaps you are nuts.\n \n I guess since you don't believe that the mention of God on money, the Pledge, on buildings, and in official documents supports or endorses religion, your religion has nothing to do with God. I suspected as much.\n \n What was your purpose in quoting Abington School Dist. v. Schempp (374 U.S. 203)? Exactly how does preventing you from imposing your religion on others by law establish a religion of secularism. Did you actually read the decision? The next sentence after the one you quoted goes on to say, \"We do not agree, however, that this decision in any sense has that effect.\" Isn't it funny that Abington School Dist. v. Schempp was an application of the Fourteenth Amendment that you seemed unaware of in your comments? Do you really think that preventing the reading of the Bible and the recitation of the Lord's Prayer in classrooms is an establishment of secularism? Do you really feel that forcing students to practice your religion is nothing more than your right to freely practice your religion?\n \n Let's see. What other **** do you babble on about? Congressional Chaplains? Since there is no law involved, how would they violate the Constitution? The two houses of Congress are essentially private institutions for which the members may make their own rules. The \"10 Commandments\" on the Supreme Court are not laws, but architectural. Besides, the \"10 Commandments\" are actually nothing but the depiction of stone tablets with Roman numerals on them that are part of a one minor character in a frieze of several ancient lawgivers (17 others as a matter of fact, including Hammurabi, Confucius, Napoleon, Solon and Chief Justice John Marshall). Because it includes secular figures in a way that doesn't endorse religion, the display is constitutional.\n \n As for the so-called Congressional Bible, it is another case of you speaking from ignorance. It was not printed or paid for by Congress. It was printed by Robert Aiken with his own money. Proponents of prayer in the schools have cited it as a precedent for official recognition of the Bible by the government and have called for a Constitutional amendment that would allow Bible reading and prayer in public schools. However, the events of 1782 predate our Constitution, and the Congress did not authorize Aitken's or any other Bible. Aitken's preface makes it clear that a separation of Church and State was maintained: the Congress merely recommended Aitken's edition to Americans who wished to read a Bible and authorized only that Aitken freely print the recommendation. Aitken was not officially solicited to print his work, the Congress paid him nothing for his efforts, and no legal statement was made by the government regarding the use of the Bible in public schools.\n \n Let me explain the concept to you again just to make sure that you grasp it - the Aitken Bible predated the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The Congress was the Continental Congress operating under the Articles of Confederation and NOT the Congress of the United States under the Constitution. Discussions of the constitutionality of any action must necessarily be an action the occurred after the Constitution was adopted.",

I was not aware that any legislative body had passed that law. Please go through the commandments and cite a few examples of local, state and federal law that are based on the commandments. By the way, prohibitions against murder and theft don't count since they are generally rules of behavior that are recognized by most societies. They actually have nothing to do with the 10 commandments. But as for the rest, please give me specific examples of our laws and the history that you seem to know so much about that supports your assertion. I actually am fairly well educated about the political foundations of our country and I was not aware that our laws were based on the 10 commandments.

Cambridge. 1992. 379 pages.\n \n Flowers, Ronald B. That Godless Court: Supreme Court Decisions on Church-State Relationships. Westminster John Knox Press.

Do you favor taxing the general population to support them since you don't wish to allow some people to work?\n \nDo you think knowledge of the world is derived from divine revelation as opposed to observation, experimentation and rational analysis?\n\n I think if you balance both together you are able to become a more rounded person.\n\n Can you give an example of divine revelation that adds to the knowledge of the world? How does belief in superstition make a person \"rounded?\"\n \nDo you think that revenge is an acceptable motive for the punishment of crime and national involvement in global conflict?\n\n Depends, with our screwed up legal system now a days sure. Watch or Read the book A Time To Kill.\n\n When you mention our screwed up legal system, are you refering to the one that you asserted above is based on the 10 commandments? Certainly Biblical law was based on the idea of revenge. What does a work of fiction have to do with it and how does it apply to the invasion of other countries.\n \nDo you think that people should be treated equally regardless of their ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation?\n\n Nope, sexual orientation is not standard to which you can measure equality too, you are born a certain gender or ethnic background your sexual orientation is your choice.\n\n Really? Then I assume that you heterosexuality and homosexuality have equal attractions for you and as a matter of choice you have selected one over the other. I would be interested in how and why you made that decision. You see, I never had a choice in my sexual orientation. As far back as I can remember I was aware of my sexuality. I had no choice in my sexuality and actually have no interest in even experimenting. Did you try them both? If now, then how did you decide on one orientation over another. Do you stay mainly with one orientation and just dabble from time to time with the other to solidify your decision?\n \nDo you hold to ethical principles that do not rely on religious dogma?\n\n Some, well more than half, but the rest is reason and common logic.\n\n More than half? Please give us some examples. Personally I think that ethical principles based on religious dogma are held more out of fear of punishment that for any higher rational reason. I fear those whose morals are based on fear of punishment since if their faith fails, then there is nothing to prevent them from becoming sociopaths. I prefer people whose morality is based on reason and logic.",

   " Are you posting such disinformation because you are deceptive or because you are ignorant? I suspect it is the later because you are so dedicated to imposing your religion on everyone. \n\n The acknowledgement of God in the government and public squares isn't \"imposing\" anyone's religion on anyone anymore than the acknowledgment of a Creator in the Declaration of Independence does. \n \n First, there are two clauses dealing with freedom of religion. Both the Establishment and the Free Exercise Clauses, by their terms, restrict legislative action by Congress. However, both clauses have been interpreted by the Supreme Court to apply also to the states, by means of the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. Therefore, whether the government action in question is federal or state, the same standards apply to each. \n\n Any secular or liberal attempt to stifle or shut the mouths of law-abiding Americans who wish to acknowledge God, whether in the government or the public square, is an abomination of justice. And the Supreme Court has upheld the use of Public Schools for Bible Clubs, etc., where such schools allow meetings for other types of clubs.\n \n What was your purpose in quoting Abington School Dist. v. Schempp (374 U.S. 203)? Exactly how does preventing you from imposing your religion on others by law establish a religion of secularism. \n\n This \"imposing\" one's religion on someone that you talk about is a farce. If someone were to impose their religion on you they'd probably show up at your house, break down your door, tie you up, and read you the Bible, or whatever they had. Just a lot of hot air. If you don't like the mention of God in government go to Cuba or somewhere. \n \n The \"10 Commandments\" on the Supreme Court are not laws, but architectural. \n\n <chuckle< Fine then, let's do some more decorating!!\n \n As for the so-called Congressional Bible, it is another case of you speaking from ignorance. It was not printed or paid for by Congress. It was printed by Robert Aiken with his own money. \n\n Sorry, but the Continental Congress, on Sept. 10, 1782, officially authorized Robert Aitken to print his Bible. Who paid for it is beside the point.\n \n \nLet me explain the concept to you again just to make sure that you grasp it - the Aitken Bible predated the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The Congress was the Continental Congress operating under the Articles of Confederation and NOT the Congress of the United States under the Constitution \n\n Perhaps you would prefer the National Day of Prayer that Congress passed in Joint Resolution on January 25, 1988? Or maybe you might instead prefer the vote of the fifty-seventh Congress in 1904, whereby Congress authorized the printing, for its use, of 9,000 copies (3,000 copies for the House and 6,000 copies for the Senate) of Thomas Jefferson's \"Morals of Jesus of Nazareth\"? Or you might recall that on April 27, 1789, the Senate, and two days later the House, passed a Coingressional resolution giving the following instructions with regard to the Inauguration of George Washington: \"Resolved, That after the oath shall have been administered...he, attended by the Vice President, and the members of the Senate, and House of Representatives, proceed to St. Paul's Chapel, to hear divine service, to be performed by the Chaplain of Congress already appointed.\" \n \n Imagine that - the government directing members of Congress to attend a church service!!! The secular humanists must be turning over in their graves, LOL!!",

   "Proposed Seal for the United States\n \n On July 4, 1776, Congress appointed Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams \"to bring in a device for a seal for the United States of America.\" Franklin's proposal adapted the biblical story of the parting of the Red Sea (left). Jefferson first recommended the \"Children of Israel in the Wilderness, led by a Cloud by Day, and a Pillar of Fire by night. . . .\" He then embraced Franklin's proposal and rewrote it . Jefferson's revision of Franklin's proposal was presented by the committee to Congress on August 20. Although not accepted these drafts reveal the religious temper of the Revolutionary period. Franklin and Jefferson were among the most theologically liberal of the Founders, yet they used biblical imagery for this important task.\n \n A picture of the seal showing a relief of Moses and the parting of the Red Sea.\n \n http://lcweb.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/vc006418.jpg\n \n Congressional Thanksgiving Day Proclamation\n \n Congress set December 18, 1777, as a day of thanksgiving on which the American people \"may express the grateful feelings of their hearts and consecrate themselves to the service of their divine benefactor\" and on which they might \"join the penitent confession of their manifold sins . . . that it may please God, through the merits of Jesus Christ, mercifully to forgive and blot them out of remembrance.\" Congress also recommends that Americans petition God \"to prosper the means of religion for the promotion and enlargement of that kingdom which consisteth in righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.'\" \n \n Morality in the Army\n \n Congress was apprehensive about the moral condition of the American army and navy and took steps to see that Christian morality prevailed in both organizations. In the Articles of War, seen below, governing the conduct of the Continental Army (seen above) (adopted, June 30, 1775; revised, September 20, 1776), Congress devoted three of the four articles in the first section to the religious nurture of the troops. Article 2 \"earnestly recommended to all officers and soldiers to attend divine services.\" Punishment was prescribed for those who behaved \"indecently or irreverently\" in churches, including courts-martial, fines and imprisonments. Chaplains who deserted their troops were to be court-martialed. \n \n Christianizing the Delawares\n \n In this resolution, Congress makes public lands available to a group for religious purposes. Responding to a plea from Bishop John Ettwein (1721-1802), Congress voted that 10,000 acres on the Muskingum River in the present state of Ohio \"be set apart and the property thereof be vested in the Moravian Brethren . . . or a society of the said Brethren for civilizing the Indians and promoting Christianity.\" The Delaware Indians were the intended beneficiaries of this Congressional resolution.\n \n \n http://lcweb.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel04.html",

   "The acknowledgement of God in the government and public squares isn't \"imposing\" anyone's religion on anyone anymore than the acknowledgment of a Creator in the Declaration of Independence does.\n\n But I don't acknowledge your god. The acknowledgement of your god by my government by placing your religious symbols on government property is most certainly the imposition of your religion on all citizens. The Supreme Court has said so.\n \n Of course, as anyone who has bothered to educate themselves in the matter knows, the \"Creator\" in the Declaration of Independence is not the Christian God. Thomas Jefferson, along with many of the signers of that document, was a deist. So the Creator is certainly not a personal god, but more along the line of \"Nature and Nature's God.\"\n \nAny secular or liberal attempt to stifle or shut the mouths of law-abiding Americans who wish to acknowledge God, whether in the government or the public square, is an abomination of justice. And the Supreme Court has upheld the use of Public Schools for Bible Clubs, etc., where such schools allow meetings for other types of clubs.\n\n Your hysterical whining doesn't make your point. The paragraph that you were responding to was a paraphrase from a Constitutional law tutorial for law students. The First Amendment is not an attempt to stifle anyone. It is an attempt to prevent the government from endorsing or supporting religion, and from outlawing or seriously burdening a person's pursuit of religion. If you actually were law-abiding, you would not advocate the violation of the rights of others by using the government to impose your religion. You may acknowledge your god however you wish - you may do so in your home, in your church, and you may even stand on the corner and wave your Bible over your head and scream at passers-by as I have seen several christians do. All Constitutionally protected actions. You may even pray in schools and schools may offer voluntary classes in comparative religion or mythology where your god is discussed. You may form a club with like minded students to acknowledge your god and that club may meet on school property. The point is not that God cannot be mentioned on government property. The point is that the government is prohibited from even the appearance of endorsing or supporting any one religious creed or any creed whatsoever.\n \n If it is allowable to use government property to post icons of your religion, then shouldn't it be also allowable to give equal time to all religions? If you construct a monument of the 10 commandments (which ones, by the way? The Protestant version, the Catholic version, or the version that is referred to as the \"10 Commandments\" in the Bible?) Is it OK to put up a monument next to your commandments that declares, \"Allah is the greatest. There is no God but Allah\"?\n \nThis \"imposing\" one's religion on someone that you talk about is a farce. If someone were to impose their religion on you they'd probably show up at your house, break down your door, tie you up, and read you the Bible, or whatever they had. Just a lot of hot air. If you don't like the mention of God in government go to Cuba or somewhere.\n\n Now you are acting the fool. How utterly silly. If my children are required to recite a prayer to your god in school, that is the imposition of your religion. If I am required to see a monument to your god in a court house where I am required to be by law, that is an imposition of your religion. Really, if you can't add anything intelligent to the discussion, why say anything at all. And if I don't like the mention of your god by my government I don't have to go to Cuba. I already have a Constitution that makes such mention illegal. I wonder why you don't find it sufficient to practice your religion without restriction in public and private. Why do you find it necessary to use the force of law to impose your superstition on all citizens?\n \n<chuckle< Fine then, let's do some more decorating!!\n\n Childish!\n \nSorry, but the Continental Congress, on Sept. 10, 1782, officially authorized Robert Aitken to print his Bible. Who paid for it is beside the point.\n\n Then you have a reading problem. The pre-constitutional Continental Congress didn't authorize the printing of the Bible. They passed a resolution that recommended that Bible for those who wished to read a Bible. And since you claimed that Congress paid for the printing, who paid for it is certainly to the point. Now that you have been made a fool you are backpeddling to try to save face.\n \nPerhaps [snip of irrational tripe] appointed.\"\n\n What does any of that have to do with your assertion that your religion should be imposed on everyone by the government? Perhaps you should actually invest some effort into learning what Jefferson actually thought about Jesus. He thought he was a good man. Nothing more.\n \nImagine that - the government directing members of Congress to attend a church service!!! The secular humanists must be turning over in their graves, LOL!!\n\n You actually have no understanding of the issues, do you? How is what is essentially a private resolution by a group of men relevant? Congress may make it's own rules, and as is evident from recent events when Tom Delay violated the ethics of the House, they can change the rules to remove those violations from the rules of ethics. Congress is essentially a private club. We are actually discussing the actions of our government in endorsing or supporting religion, and the actions of our government to outlaw or burden the free practice of religion. You advocate the repeal of the First Amendment so that your religion can be imposed on citizens by the government. I feel that our First Amendment rights should be supported at all costs.\n \n I am an American patriot. You are not. You seem to prefer a theocracy of your religion.",

Thomas Jefferson, along with many of the signers of that document, was a deist. So the Creator is certainly not a personal god, but more along the line of \"Nature and Nature's God.\"\n\n \n \"Nature's God\"\n \n The concept of \"the law of nature or of God\" was used many centuries before the emergence of the Deists, and not by Thomas Aquinas alone.\n \n Even in British common law tradition, emphasizes Gary T. Amos, \"law of nature\" meant the eternal moral law that God the Creator established over his created universe. \n \n Blackstone remarked that the will of the Creator is called \"the law of nature\" and he wrote expressly of the \"law of nature\" being \"dictated by God himself.\" \n \n Others used \"law of nature\" and \"law of God\" interchangeably. Hence Amos contends that, \"Every key term in the Declaration of Independence had its roots in the Bible, Christian theology, the Western Christian intellectual tradition, medieval Christianity, Christian political theory, and the Christian influence on the six-hundred-year development of the English common law.\"\n \n Most of the nation's founders had a special regard for God and the Bible, and for Christian principles. They did not necessarily use the terms they did in a deistic sense. They did not regard faith and reason as alternatives, but believed in intelligible divine revelation. \n \n \"The laws of nature and of nature's God\" was a shorthand phrase for natural revelation and for special revelation: \"creation law\" and \"scriptural law\" were not at odds. \n \n http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9501/articles/henry.htm\n \n Regarding the \"deism\" of the Founding Fathers that your fellow secular humanists try to foist on people:\n \n The late D.M. Bradford of the University of Dallas, found that amongst the Founding Fathers, there were 28 Episcopalians, 8 Presbyterians, 7 Congregationalists, 2 Lutherans, 2 Dutch Reformed, 2 Methodists, 2 Roman Catholics, and only 3 deists. And even amongst the so-called deists, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin both believed, contrary to strict 18th century deism, that God did intervene in the affairs of men and nations. \n \n To quote the U.S. Library of Congress, \"Deists in the United States never amounted to more than a small percentage of an evangelical population\", in the late 18th century.\n \n The rest of your rantings are steeped in folly.",

The Great Awakening swept the English-speaking world, as religious energy vibrated between England, Wales, Scotland and the American colonies in the 1730s and 1740s. In America, the Awakening signaled the advent of an encompassing evangelicalism--the belief that the essence of religious experience was the \"new birth,\" inspired by the preaching of the Word. It invigorated even as it divided churches. The supporters of the Awakening and its evangelical thrust--Presbyterians, Baptists and Methodists--became the largest American Protestant denominations by the first decades of the nineteenth century. Opponents of the Awakening or those split by it--Anglicans, Quakers, and Congregationalists--were left behind.\n \n Deists, never more than \"a minority within a minority,\" were submerged by evangelicalism in the nineteenth century.... Deists in the United States never amounted to more than a small percentage of an evangelical population.  \n \n So much for your secular revisionism.....\n \n Jesus is Lord!!",

   "Washington a deist? LOL! Nice try.\n\n Good answer! What a great demonstration of your abilities of research and you knowledge of history. It is common knowledge that is generally accepted by historians. The only argument is from fundamentalist christians who want to believe that the U.S. is a christian nation founded on christian principles by christian leaders. It is their excuse for attempting to impose their religion on everyone by forcing christian prayer into the schools and erecting christian monuments in government buildings. It seems that what has become most important to fundamentalist christianity are the appearances of defending their faith by forcing it on everyone.\n \n But I digress. Before the Revolution the Episcopal Church was the state religion of Virginia. In effect, local churches were the local governments of the time. Election as a vestryman in a local church was tantamount to election to a city council. The duties were not limited to church matters by any means. In fact, the matters of business of the local vestries were mostly civil in nature. Washington was a vestryman.\n \n He also attended church with his wife. But there is no record that he was ever a communicant in any church. It was Washington's custom to leave services before communion. When Rev. James Abercrombie, rector of St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Philadelphia mentioned that those in elevated stations set a bad example by leaving at communion, Washington ceased attending all services that included a communion service. After Washington's death the Rev. Abercrombie (Washington's close friend), when asked about his beliefs replied, \"Sir, Washington was a Deist.\" In Washington's private correspondence there is no mention whatsoever of Jesus Christ or God. He made no request for a clergyman to be present when he was on his deathbed, and his funeral services were those of the Freemasons. Certainly sounds like a christian to me. How about you?\n \n Why don't you educate yourself and learn the facts of history instead of what you want the facts to be?\n \nFrom the Library of Congress link:...So much for your secular revisionism...\n\n I understand that your desire to impose a theocracy of your religion in this country is so strong that you have difficulty actually grasping ideas that do not support it. I didn't mention church membership. In fact, I did point out that every citizen of Virginia was, in effect, a member of the Episcopal Church. It was the state religion. Every one of the original colonies had a state religion at one time, with the exception of Rhode Island. Our Congress likes the idea of a christian nation and the Library of Congress reflects that. Churches were built with taxes levied on the general population.\n \n I gave you a list of several books written by respected historians that will give you a different view. What I spoke of was church attendence. Did I say \"membership?\" If so then I misspoke. Sorry if you were mislead. But the fact remains that only 8 to 15% of the population actually attended church and practiced any religion in the last quarter of the 18th century.\n \nDeists in the United States never amounted to more than a small percentage of an evangelical population.\n\n Probably true. But this country wasn't founded by the \"evangelical population\" of this country. Our founders were educated and well read. They understood Descartes and Locke (the literal source of \"life, liberty and...). None of the major concepts of the Declaration of Independence is based on christianity: certainly not self evident truth - christianity is based on divine revelation; certainly not the equality of all men - christianity has recognized the legitimacy of slavery and the divine right of nobility for 2000 years; certainly not the idea of inalienable rights - all christian churches have always been more than willing to deny both life and liberty to anyone who disagreed with dogma; life and liberty have been mentioned (as strictly humanistic concepts derived from Locke), but there remains the pursuit of happiness - certainly not a christian concept in this vale of tears where we are meant to atone for wrongs by suffering, even to the extent of self flagellation and penance.\n \n In effect, the deists were the educated elite of our country at the time of the founding. One thing is certain. They weren't stupid and when they signed the Declaration they certainly recognized it for the humanist document that it is.\n \n It is actually quite similar today. Even Gallup (a fundamentalist christian) recognizes that the more educated a person becomes, the less likely they are to be fundamentalist christians.\n \nJesus is Lord!!\n\n That's just so beautiful that it brings tears to my eyes. It is the ultimate argument based on libraries of evidence. I think we should engrave it over the door of every public building in our country. I think that we should require every student in the public schools to declare it openly, every day. Refusal to do so should result in jail time until such time that the wayward should declare the same.\n \n I'm sure that you will agree that the only problem with the Taliban is that they worshiped the wrong god (even thought they actually worship the same god).\n \n Edit: I forgot to ask. Did you select your handle because you feel some affinity to unemployed drug smugglers? Have you actually ever seen the movie? Exactly how do you reconcile that with your holier than thou attitude on this board? Do you actually think that \"Easyrider\" has positive connotations for anything more than 25% of the population? I could be wrong there, but I am a contemporary of Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda. Take my word for it - an easy rider is someone out to make a killing at the advantage of others.

Yet here we are - as a result, I believe, of spontaneous generation\" (quote from Scientific American). That kind of a statement surely demonstrates a much greater faith than a religious creationist can possibly muster. Dr. Wald categorically states that it could not possibly have happened - yet he believes it did. A Christian who professes to so great a faith would be labeled as naive and gullible. What a difference a cloak of higher education makes to those who are so easily impressed! A Swiss mathematician by the name of Charles Eugene Guye computed the odds of such an occurrence at one chance in 10 to the 160th power. That's one over ten followed by 160 zeros! Your chances of winning the Florida Lottery are one in fourteen million, and people say you're a fool for spending your money on such an enormous improbability, but these same people will turn right around and put their eternal faith in an event that is millions and millions of times less likely to occur.

There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together 34 and saying, \"It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.\" 35 Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread. \n \n Luke 24:36 - While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, \"Peace be with you.\" 37 They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. 38 He said to them, \"Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? 39 Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.\" \n \n John 20:16 - Jesus said to her, \"Mary.\" She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, \"Rabboni!\" (which means Teacher). 17 Jesus said, \"Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.' \" 18 Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: \"I have seen the Lord!\" And she told them that he had said these things to her. \n \n John 20:19 - On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" 20 After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord. \n \n John 20:26 - A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" 27 Then he said to Thomas, \"Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.\" 28 Thomas said to him, \"My Lord and my God!\" \n \n 1 Corinthians 15:3 - For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 5and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve. 6 After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. 7 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, 8 and last of all he appeared to me also... \n \n Acts 1:1 - In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach 2 until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. 3 After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. 4 On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: \"Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. \n \n 1 John 4:14 - And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. \n \n 2 Peter 1:16 - We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.\n \n Luke 1:1 - Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, 2 just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. 3 Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 4 so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. \n \n Matthew 28:5 - The angel said to the women, \"Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 6 He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. 7 Then go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you.\" 8 So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. 9 Suddenly Jesus met them. \"Greetings,\" he said.
