   "It really sucks.\n \n Dimebag Darryl was a badass guitarist. A lot of people started to copy his style after \"Cowboys from hell.\" Surely ole Zak Wyllde (or however you spell it) ripped off some of his style and took it mainstream with Ozzy on \"No more tears.\"\n \n It really sucks.\n \n If Phil Anselmo didn't suck so much, I'd be a diehard Pantera fan simply because Darryl's riffs were so heavy. I think it's safe to say the he put the heavy back into heavy metal. \n \n His death is dark moment in rock.\n \n I'll light one up for ya D!",
