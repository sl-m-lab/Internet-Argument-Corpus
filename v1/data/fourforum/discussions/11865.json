   "Recently read a great article by Campbell Brown on the CNN website. If Obama wins it will be due to breaking his campaign promises.\n \n From the article: \n \n\n You may have heard that Wednesday night Barack Obama will be on five different TV networks speaking directly to the American people.\n \n He bought 30 minutes of airtime from the different networks, a very expensive purchase. But hey, he can afford it. Barack Obama is loaded, way more loaded than John McCain, way more loaded than any presidential candidate has ever been at this stage of the campaign.\n Just to throw a number out: He has raised well over $600 million since the start of his campaign, close to what George Bush and John Kerry raised combined in 2004. \n \n Without question, Obama has set the bar at new height with a truly staggering sum of cash. And that is why as we approach this November, it is worth reminding ourselves what Barack Obama said last November. \n \n One year ago, he made a promise. He pledged to accept public financing and to work with the Republican nominee to ensure that they both operated within those limits.\n \n Then it became clear to Sen. Obama and his campaign that he was going to be able to raise on his own far more cash than he would get with public financing. So Obama went back on his word. \n \n He broke his promise and he explained it by arguing that the system is broken and that Republicans know how to work the system to their advantage. He argued he would need all that cash to fight the ruthless attacks of 527s, those independent groups like the Swift Boat Veterans. It's funny though, those attacks never really materialized\n \n The Washington Post pointed out recently that the bad economy has meant a cash shortage among the 527s and that this election year they have been far less influential.\n \n The courageous among Obama's own supporters concede this decision was really made for one reason, simply because it was to Obama's financial advantage.\n \n On this issue today, former Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, an Obama supporter, writes in The New York Post, \"a hypocrite is a person who puts on a false appearance of virtue -- who acts in contradiction to his or her stated beliefs or feelings. And that, it seems to me, is what we are doing now.\"\n \n For this last week, Sen. Obama will be rolling in dough. His commercials, his get-out-the-vote effort will, as the pundits have said, dwarf the McCain campaign's final push. But in fairness, you have to admit, he is getting there in part on a broken promise. \n\n \n \n \n Do we really want a man who breaks promises as fundamental as these, when it suits him, to lead our country? Which other pledges and campaign promises will this man break when it suits him if the ignorant masses help him to win? I'm expecting basically every promise. So much for his protestations that he doesn't do politics as usual......",

Bush himself is an excellent example of a president who essentially broke every major promise he made as a candidate.",

He \"won\" his first election by having all other names removed from the ballot. He voted \"present\" on controversial issues to keep from making waves by offending one side or the other. He has been groomed by people like Bill Ayers and other radicals who couldn't be elected if they had to. He is a Marxist in centrist clothing and will show his true colors AFTER he is inaugurated.\n \n Democrats will lie to us and deceive us with twisted truths until they all die.",

   "Asked if he would participate in the public-financing system if he was nominated for president and his major opponents agreed to do the same, Mr. Obama wrote yes. Then he added, also in writing, &#8220;If I am the Democratic nominee, I will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election.&#8221;\n \n As the two campaigns dueled, people on both sides said it was possible that they would agree to accept public financing and then simply have each political party spend unlimited amounts on behalf of its candidate, including money for voter mobilization efforts and television commercials, as allowed by law.\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/15/us/politics/15finance.html\n \n Also:\n \nTo understand the background to this dispute, it is necessary to go back to February 2007 when the Obama campaign raised the possibility of accepting public funds with the Federal Election Commission. In a Feb. 1, 2007 letter to the FEC, lawyers for Obama asked whether the campaign could \"provisionally raise funds for the general election but retain the option\" of returning the contributions if an agreement was reached with other major candidates on accepting public financing. The FEC ruled on March 1 that this was permissable, as long as the general election funds were kept in a clearly separate account from the primary election funds.\n \n The Obama campaign is correct in arguing that there is nothing in the Feb. 1 letter to the FEC that can be fairly interpreted as committing the campaign to accepting public financing. Obama spokesman Bill Burton told Politico on Feb. 28, 2007 that the senator would not necessarily commit himself to participating in the public financing system if the commission approved his proposal. \"It would be a situation where if the Republican agreed to opt-in to the public financing system, it would be something we would explore,\" Burton told Politico.\n\n The Obama 'pledge' - Fact Checker\n \n I don't interpret what Obama did as a solid pledge to accept public funding.\n \n My God! The man is a constitutional scholar and lawyer, after all. He was also enormously aware of the smear attacks of 527s that would not come under the governance of such an agreement between Obama and McCain -- and it was quite apparent that the 527 smear machines on the right were loading up on millions of dollars from corrupt supporters and foul materials from the likes of smear merchants such as Karl Rove.",
