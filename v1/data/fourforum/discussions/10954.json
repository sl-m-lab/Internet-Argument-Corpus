You change the way inflation is estimated. Also, the ay that money enters the economy makes a big difference. That is what is so GREAT about government spending based on debt (or monetarization of you rbonds if you can;t get anybody to buy them). Government spending has a flow through multiplier of around 6 (that being the number of times it is counted for GDP purposes). That is where EVERY BIT of our growth during the REagan years came from....his deficit spending. His tax cuts were idiotic and nonsensical, as were the rest of his fiscal policies. \n \n You can avoid inflation, though if you keep that free capital locked up. Look at the US economy since Reagan and you see that we have basically jumped from bubble to bubble. We had the Ag bubble, biotech bubble, S&L bubble (the S&L crisis is what happened after the bubble burst) Dot com, bubble, etc..\n \n Reagan was probably not smart enough to understand these things, but Vokler was, and Greenspan was, and some of Reagans people were and there is NO QUESTION that Reagan, Bush, and Clinton all engineered the inflation of these bubbles. None whatsoever. \n \n It is amazing to me how quickly the \"debate\" on reaganomics died, and how completely his legacy has been destroyed. I do not know a single economist, or for that matter a single person perfessionally involved with economics, who is willing to defend reaganomics anymore. Even greenspan in his book is EXTREMELY harsh of Reagan and seems to imply that had not Bubba worked hard to clean up Reagans mess, the nation may well have failed a decade and a half ago. \n \n On the up side, Greenspans book did clarify one thing abotu reagan. I always assumed the man was just evil. It turns out I may have been mistaken. Greenspan argues that he was not evil, just stupid. Oddly enough that actually makes me feel better. \n \n There still does seem to be one holdout group in the pro reagan camp, and that is the friedmanites. Fortunatly nobody takes them seriously anymore (outside some of the voting public...not a group known for their intelligence) and they are usually easy to silence. They start in with their BS, you point out the well known fact that Friedmans was actually RUNNING the economy of Argentina when it crashed, and they go away.",

Look at Canada subsidizing their Lumber Industry in the 90s for another example, and see how the Clintons allowed it to happen resulting in the near total collapse of the American Lumber Industry.\n With the World's Strongest Economy, the US Should Be Negotiating From a Position of Strength on Trade Issues\n William R. Hawkins\n Wednesday, January 30, 2002\n \n The Europe Union, Japan, South Korea, and Brazil have threatened to file complaints with the World Trade Organization if President George W. Bush invokes American law to curb steel imports in support of the beleaguered domestic industry. WTO rules do permit \"safeguards\" to curtail imports for up to three years if an industry is under pressure from imports. However, given the trend at the WTO to rule against American laws and actions, some observers are predicting sanctions of up to $8 billion could be levied on U.S. exports.\n \n Various \"free trade\" groups are using the threat of foreign retaliation to argue against Washington's acting to protect a key domestic industry from predatory attack. There is no need for such panic. It would take over a year to work through the WTO dispute and appeal process before any action by foreign states could be taken, even if they won. \n \n The dispute does, however, raise an interesting question. Why are foreign industrialists (and the governments that subsidize them) not deterred by the threat of American trade retaliation, but expect Washington to be afraid of retaliation for its defensive acts? The United States has enormous diplomatic and economic strength. It should be able to deter any hostile action on pain of an escalating trade war which America would win. If it can't, it's only because Washington is not credible. Past leaders have too often waffled or backed down to avoid a fight. \n The United States opened a Section 201 case in June against the \"dumping\" of imports by foreign steel producers who are facing weak markets during a global slowdown. In his letter calling on the International Trade Commission to investigate, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick stressed the importance of the issue: \"America's steel industry and its more than 200,000 workers play an important role in our nation's economy, providing high-quality products to the manufacturing, construction, and energy sectors.\" He also framed the problem for the ITC, \"The U.S. steel industry has been affected by a 50-year legacy of foreign government intervention in the market and direct financial support of their steel industries The result has been significant excess capacity, inefficient production, and a glut of steel on world markets.\"\n \n President Bush struck the same note in his State of the Union address, saying. \"When America works, America prospers; so my economic security plan can be summed up in one word: jobs.\" He then stated \"the way to create jobs, is to grow the economy by encouraging investment in factories and equipment.\" But why would any firm build new factories or buy new equipment, if it faced the specter of being driven out of business by imports? Since 1997, 26 American steel companies have filed for bankruptcy despite having invested in the most modern technology available. It is policy, not productivity, that is driving international competition.\n http://www.americaneconomicalert.org/view_art.asp?Prod_ID=205\n \n \nThat is because you are not bright enough to realize that if you subtract US aid from israels GDP it tells a radically different story. A welfare state if ever one existed.\n\n \n Yeah, sure daewoo, I'm ignorant and you see from an omnipresent perspective. But CNN, a liberal source of News disagrees with you. \n Israel's economy outperforms\n \n Story Highlights\n Israel's gross domestic product outpaced that of major economies in 2007\n Country's economic growth expected to slow in 2008 as U.S. economy falters\n Technology, pharmaceutical, chemicals industries fueling economic growth\n By Hilary Whiteman\n (CNN) -- Israel's economy has done remarkably well for a country involved in a prolonged and violent political struggle over the Palestinian territories.\n \n The country's economy grew more than five percent last year -- faster than the U.S., Europe, UK and Japan.\n \n While the Bank of Israel expects the country's fortunes to dip next year, along with the world economy, growth is still expected to exceed four percent. Not bad, given that the U.S., one of its biggest trading partners, is staring down the barrel of potential recession.\n \n \"The Israeli economy has managed to develop a kind of isolation from the political instability,\" says Yossi Mekelberg, Associate Fellow of the Middle East Program at Chatham House.\n \n \"It's almost isolated, mainly because it's based on hi-tech, pharmaceutical industries, and chemicals, and I think these are the things that are less conditioned by the political situation.\"\n \n Israel says it spends a greater percentage of its GDP on hi-tech research and development than any other country.\n \n According to the Israel Venture Capital Research Center, 3,361 hi-tech companies are operating in Israel. And they're attracting foreign interest and dollars. In the first three quarters of 2007, they raised more than $1.2 billion dollars in funding, 10 percent more than the same period the previous year.\n \n Yossi Vardi is an industry veteran. He backed his first technology business almost forty years ago and has so far lent his expertise to 65 fledgling companies.\n \n \"Our strength on the food chain is usually in the very early stages where you have to come with ideas, innovation and take great risks,\" Yossi Vardi says.\n \n \"The hi-tech industry is not a monolithic thing. In China, they do manufacturing. In India, they do coding. We are very good in the early stages, like Silicon Valley. And this is what the world is looking for in Israel.\"\n \n The country's fortunes contrast sharply with the economic turmoil engulfing the Palestinian territories.\n \n According to the World Bank, the Israeli per capita GDP is more than 20 times that of the Palestinians.\n \n Two-thirds of Palestinian people are thought to be living in poverty, although some say the figure could be even higher.\n \n Since the election of Hamas in 2006, private investment in the region has all but dried up.\n \n The government is relying on loans, remittances and donor aid, but it's not enough to cover expenditure. The World Bank estimated the Palestinian National Authority was running up a deficit of $100 million a month in the first half of 2007.\n \n This week, after meeting with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, U.S. President George W. Bush called for them to make \"painful concessions\" to reach a peace deal.\n \n Bush has predicted a peace treaty will be signed by the time he leaves office in 2009.\n \n Yossi Mekelberg from the foreign policy think-tank Chatham House says a deal would create economic benefits for both sides of the divide.\n \n \"I think the direct benefits of a peace agreement would be immense, both for the Israelis and the Palestinians,\" he says.\n \n \"When there is a peace agreement there will be more investment. The European Union, the United States, and others will investors will pour more money, as happened post-1993. And also, let's bear in mind there will be an extra growing economy that has more than four million people, the Palestinian economy, so, a peace dividend can be only positive.\n \n Find this article at: \n http://edition.cnn.com/2008/BUSINESS/01/10/israel.economy/index.html\n ",

Yo do realize that the US made ALL the rules for the WTO, right? The US was the only country that did not have to change even ONE SINGLE trade law when the WTO came into being because WE are the ones who created it and then forced others to agree to it. \n \n What has bush done for the steel industry? What steps has he taken to make it competitive on the world stage? NONE. All he has done is tried to protect the US steel industry from competition. What that means is that he has ensures that EVERY AMERICAN who buys a product with steel in it essentially pays a hidden tax in order to subsidize a non competitive industry. \n \n There is a reason that we stopped using protectionist trade policies and then created the WTO to try to stop other nations from doing so. It is not becuase they worked well. Rather it is because it has been proven beyond any doubt, time and again, that measures such as those that Bush has been trying to take are BAD for your economy. They are destructive as hell. Bushs efforts to protect the steel industry have NOTHING AT ALL to do with trying to help the US economy. They are result of hundreds of millions of dollars spent by the steel lobby. #### like this is why the US is in the position it is in today. Measures that Bush has tried to take (without much sucess thank god) woudl cost American consumers billions of dollars. In the mean time it would keep american steel producers from having to take the necessary steps to actually become competitive on the world stage.\n \n \n \nThe Europe Union, Japan, South Korea, and Brazil have threatened to file complaints with the World Trade Organization if President George W.

However, given the trend at the WTO to rule against American laws and actions, some observers are predicting sanctions of up to $8 billion could be levied on U.S. exports.\n\n \n I will ocmment on some of this even though you did not write it jsut because it is so stupid and easy to pick apart.\n \n What Bush is suggesting is so far outside of the \"safeguards\" provision that it is insane. He seems to be implying here that there is something wrong with other nations fling complaints with the WTO, the organization that the US set up and forced other nations to join, if the US does somethign that violates the WTO guidelines....which the US wrote. \n \n \nVarious \"free trade\" groups are using the threat of foreign retaliation to argue against Washington's acting to protect a key domestic industry from predatory attack. There is no need for such panic. It would take over a year to work through the WTO dispute and appeal process before any action by foreign states could be taken, even if they won. \n\n \n Obviously an old article. Bushs attemts to buy votes from th steel workers uniions failed way back on 2002. HE could not even get the republican rubber stamp congress to approve it. The steel industries own economists said that the plan would be a disaster for the steel industry and a nightmare for US consumers. \n \n \nThe United States opened a Section 201 case in June against the \"dumping\" of imports by foreign steel producers who are facing weak markets during a global slowdown. In his letter calling on the International Trade Commission to investigate, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick stressed the importance of the issue: \"America's steel industry and its more than 200,000 workers play an important role in our nation's economy, providing high-quality products to the manufacturing, construction, and energy sectors.\" He also framed the problem for the ITC, \"The U.S. steel industry has been affected by a 50-year legacy of foreign government intervention in the market and direct financial support of their steel industries The result has been significant excess capacity, inefficient production, and a glut of steel on world markets.\"\n\n \n The US complaint was found to be without merit...even by our own investigators. Jsut more rhetorical BS from the Bush administration. \n \n \n \nYeah, sure daewoo, I'm ignorant and you see from an omnipresent perspective. But CNN, a liberal source of News disagrees with you. \n\n \n There is nothing in that article that disagrees with me. Subtract Us aid and Israels growth is decidedly lackluster.",

   "I really haven't read much about Bush Sr. but the impression I got was that he was trying to actually help the problem which resulted in him getting the boot. Perhaps he shouldn't have said \"no new taxes\" before he say the situation.\n\n \n IMO the problem was that he expected the effects of the Reagan spending spree to last a little longer than they did. Once we stopped the massive deficit spending GDP dropped like a rock without that artificial stimulus. That left him in a bad spot. \n \n \nSpeaking of the Baby Boomers....it is becoming clearer and clearer (and I'm not one of them) that they are the case of so many problems today. Spoiled brats haha. I say this by just looking at their history with the hippie movement trying to get their way on everything which extended to their young adult time in the 80s when they wanted the government to solve every problem they had (just think MADD, smoking, entitlement programs, Cold War), and just a general notion that they deserve X without paying for it. Perhaps the solution is to make the death tax 100% haha so they can pay for it at the end.\n\n \n As the economy continues to deteriorate I think that there is going to be some backlash against the boomers. Right now a lot of them seem to be couting on the voting power of the old farts to ensure they are taken care of (since most of them did not bother to save any money). As our economy falls out from under us and it becomes increasingly clear that the baby boomers basically spent everything their parents left them, everything they had a right to, and then stole everythign their kids could ever hope to have, I think that more young people will be showing up to vote and they are not going to be kind to the old farts.",

They put them in the term auction system because there is usually a lower yield requirement than on fixed bonds (sometimes up to 1.5%) and they attract special needs investors. I have used term auction bonds before in the past to park money for a week or two. They pay better than a savings account, but they are extremely liquid. \n \n The problem is that they are not always entirely stable since they are geared almost entirely towards special needs investors. The banks in the past have supported them rather than letting them fail when there were no offers becuase it works out well for the bank and for the bond issuer. The bank bids half a percentage higher than what the bonds would typically yield so they pull a little extra income on a safe, short term investment. \n \n \n2) The reasoning for this is because they say the bonds are \"liquid\" enough which is a concerning concept outside the topic of the article.

I don't know much about these kinds of securities.\n\n \n This is absolutly an indicator of a cash flow problem. The banks, acting as brokers, make billions of dollars per year running these auctions. By not supporting, they basically have trashed the market. I can gaurantee you that in 6 months the term auction bond market WILL BE dead. There is no question. The investors that these securities attract cannot afford to have their money stuck when they need it and bond issuers certainly are not going to be willing to actualyl risk a jump in their rates to 15+%.\n \n So, banks basically destroyed literally billions of dollars in yearly income. The only possible explanation there is that they just did not have the money to support the auctions. \n \n Just another symptom of the current collapse of the US economy.",

Coupled with the reserve figures from the fed I don't think there is any question that most of our major banks are experiencing a solvency crisis. If you look at the total value of the auctions that were allowed to fail, you are really only talking a few billion dollars thus far. From what I can find, it looks like Citi makes about $8 billion per year running these auctions, so you know that they have to be in serious hot water not to support the roughly $1.2 billion in auctions they have allowed to fail. Numbers are similar for other big banks. \n \n I do not have a whole lot of faith in KPMG. It seems like that should have been identifying a LOT of different kinds of risk for a lot of years now they they have not bothered to mention. \n \n This has been like the perfect economic storm. Just looking at the proposed \"solutions\" to some of the problems out there resuting from the collapsing debt bubble should be enough to terrify anybody. I mean, really, how bad do things have to be before you start considering splitting a bond insurer in half, with the good business on one side and the bad business on the other, screwing all their policyholders, and the government is 100% behind it? Talk about desperation.\n \n We are stuck in a situation where there are just no good options for your average investor. Traditionally safe investments are not, equity markets are in horrible shape (it appears that the dead cat bounce in the dow is over), and treasury yields are at artificial lows because people are trying to flee to quality and cannot find any, so they are settling for bonds from an issuer who by their own admission cannot possibly hope to ever pay their outstanding debt. \n \n What is funny is that we keep seeing the talking head talking about the \"possibility\" of a brief recession...maybe 2 quarters...then the economy will bounce right back. At the rate things are going, the FAR more likely scenario is that we will see 2 quarters of recession followed by a collapse into a depression that will leave the old timers wishing for the prosperous days of the 1930's. \n \n What gets me about this is the public apathy. Do people just not understand the implications here? It is armageddon in the financial markets. The entire private economic cestor is crashing and burning before our eyes. At the same time, David Walker, the comptroller of the united states, has been on a \"Fiscal wake up tour\" for the last couple of years trying to get people to understand the federal government is staring bankruptcy in the face. He finally resigned in disgust last friday. \n \n I cant decide if it is just stupidity among Americans that is the problem or if they just cannot wrap their heads around what it happening, or if it is just arrogance (a belief that we are just too big and powerful to fail).

We get what we deserve\n\n \n Maybe people just have trouble accepting that what we are ultimatly talking about is the economic failure of the united states, that we are serious, that the numbers make it ia virtual certainty, and that it CAN happen here.\n \n That is why I have, for the most part, stopped posting on other issues. Most of them, especially the long term ones, are not going to matter. Any talk of keeping our military in Iraq for 20 years is a joke since by 2013 we will be forced to downscale our military by as much as 30% in order to meet other spending obligations. It will have to be the military, there is nowhere else to take the money from, and that is assuming that we can continue to convince foreigners to purchase enough bonds to finance the interest on our debt which by that point will be about 3/4 of a billion dollars per year. Frankly I think the odds of that are about in line with the odds of me flying to the moon tomorrow morning on a spaceship built of popsicle sticks.\n \n Until we figure out what to do about our fiscal problems, everything else is pretty much superfluous. The progression of the problem has accelerated to the point that even talking solutions to our fiscal problems may be superfluous. Prior to Bush and the republican congress doubling our operating debt we had a little cushion there. Now that is gone. Our financial markets are failing and are doing so on such a massive scale that a bailout is not even a reasonable possibility. We just don't have the money.\n \n Take a look at the latest reserve figures from the fed. Non borrowed reserves have actually fallen to NEGATIVE 18 billion, which means that the ONLY reserves in our banking system are from the Feds term auction scam...basically the fed is having to run the printing presses full speed just to keep our banks solvent. \n \n Like you, I have trouble understanding why people ignore this. Maybe it is just that they are so used to hearing the big numbers attached to our debt figures that they just tune it out? Most of the other stuff discussed anymore in relation to politics is basically garbage now. Universal health care? Waste of time to even discuss it. Rising health care costs? Trust me, as the system collapses, health care will become more affordable...even if the qualtiy is not so hot. In many parts of the world you can still pay for a doctors visit with a chicken. Another 15 years and we will be able to do that here. It is time to stop worrying abotu federal restrictions or lack thereof when it comes to abortion becuase it will not be too much longer before the federal government is bankrupt and ceases to operate. That is NOT conjecture, that is just basic math. It is time for people to start studying what happened in Argentina when it collapsed and preparing. I have a couple decent links that include first hand accounts...kind of a \"man on the street\" perspective regarding the argentenian crash and they are downright scary...and things are likely to be much worse here in the US.\n \n The biggest recipient of venture capital last year was the private security sector. We are not talking ADT here, we are talking attack dogs, electrified fences, bodyguards, armored vehicles and fortified homes. I personally know several high ranking politicians who have invested in start up security firms. I am considering such an investment myself right now with a well known former congressman as a partner. No uniformed rent a cops...former military with automatic weapons. Based on his projections we will probably lose money the first 2 years but make a killing after that as the economy continues its decline.",

Probably not. You would pay for things with the money you had and then establish a little bit of debt to pay for the more expensive things such as a home. \n \n So people don't need to be experts to understand and even if you are confused or don't know a lot you can just read some true experts opinions (such as the unbiased GAO) to gain a good idea of what is going to happen. Good economic analysis comes from those who have no benefit either way the answer comes out. This is why the GAO is normally your best source (granted I am biased as an accountant haha).",

   "Who would guessed that the delay in financial data from CitiBank is because they are sucking wind.\n \n http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aKaOmvjI3yeU&refer=home\n \n Now I am fairly certain the SIV's they sponsor are not on the financial statements even when they said they would do it last year. \n \n I think the best case scenario for CitiGroup is that they are all honest in the company and will squeak out of bankruptcy thanks to a government \"loan\" to keep them floating (like Chrysler back in the day). The scenario I fear is that Enron is going to look a well run organization by the time CitiGroup gets done. Good thing they have KPMG on their side.\n\n \n IMO what they probably moved onto the financial statements is the stuff that they were SURE would go south, not the other stuff that they were only PRETTY sure would go south. \n \n IMO enron is already looking like a well run organization compared to some of these other companies. Now that the light have been turned on so to speak and we can see exactly what has been going on, I am honestly surprised that there are not a LOT of people in jail, including some government regulators and some auditors. I have been around the blocka few times and seen some crooked business dealings, but this recent stuff really does take the cake. \n \n I wonder...as banks start to fail will we see some prosecutions? Looking at the most recent reserve numbers from the fed, non borrowed reserves are running NEGATIVE 18 billion. That means that LITERALLY every bit of cash solvency in our banking system is coming from the feds term auctions. \n \n A LOT of people SHOULD be in jail right now.",

   "I believe that the economic forum is like that due to the nature of economics. It takes a fair amount of knowledge and education to repeatively post here without fear of looking like a XXXXX. Furthermore, the complicated subjects serve as a deterrent against the XXXXXX of the forum. I've been reading this thread for some time. \n\n \n That is because generally people confuse practical economics with economic theory. Most of the theory out there is ####. For thousands of years it has been a safe bet that if it would not work for your checking account, it will not work anywhere else. \n \n \nI think they don't want to listen. Remember Bassman? He made his claim that he was a economic conservative and that the GOP was economically conservative. I then listed all of the massively liberal economic policies that the GOP enacted and he deliberately ignored that post. He made a challenge and when I pushed back he simply did not want to listen. The fact that David Walker is all but ignored is a sign of that. But I do agree that people don't care until it's right in their face. The whole alternative energy / reducing consumption trend of the 70s disappeared in the 90s when the problem went away. People don't care until it's hitting their wallets.\n\n \n Unfortunatly in this case by the time it is in their face, they will need to be holding a rifle and have some kind of plan for holding off the hoards of hungry former yuppies. \n \n I am still looking for any kind of hope at all that we may be able to pull this one out with anything less than a total collapse. I am having trouble coming up with any such hope. Even if the current problems in the private sector do not destroy our economy (which is certainly a possibility), the public sector problems WILL without question. Nobody is actually talking SOLUTIONS, all we ever hear is a bunch of BS retoric. \n \n We have people talking about earmarks like that is the be all end all of the federal budget crisis when in the real world all the earmarks combines add up to little more than pocket change in the realm of federal spending. We have one side claiming that we need to cut spending, but the spending cuts they propose are little more than window dressing, then there is another group that is willing to raise taxes, but not by NEARLY enough to actually make a difference. Back in the real world, the spending cuts pretty much HAVE TO come from the military, and they need to be DEEP, like cut military budget by 80%. Tax increases need to be somewhere in the area of 20% across the board. I am not sure, though that our economy would actually survive the cure, though, since the flow through multiplier on military spending is so high and since that would push our corporate tax rate up over 50%. \n \n We are pretty much just screwed. If you look at the financial news of late, it is EXTREMELY clear that currently the big money interests that run our economy are in \"get what you can while you can\" mode. The middle class is getting fleeced and they are not even paying enough attention to realize it. Although it is somewhat shameful to admit it, I am on board with that 100%. I figure the middle class is screwed anyway, so I may as well make as much as I can while I can.",

In fact, the entitlement programs may be the better thing to cut given your analysis about the flow through. Too many people are \"contractors\" for the DoD.\n\n \n The problem with cutting the entitlement programs is that in order for that to work we have to cut SS and Medicare. First, old people are not ABOUT to take that lying down, and old people vote, so I haev trouble believing that we will actually see any meaningful changes there until the pain in the rest of the population motivates younger people to get out and outvote the old folks. By then it will be too late.\n \n The other problem there is that we would essentially have to figure out a way to cut SS and medicare without cutting benefits in any event because the bond markets have made it pretty clear that a benefit cut will be viewed as a defacto default on the T-bonds in those trust funds (which makes sense since the only reason we would cut benefits is that we cannot afford to redeem those bonds). That would increase our borrowing costs, and interest on our outstanding debt, so much that it would almost certainly negate any benefit to making the cuts in the first place.\n \n The T-bond market is pretty much just a shell game anyway. I mean, if I came to you and offered to sell you bonds in a company that has so much outstandign debt that they could never actually hope to repay it, would you snap that up? Hell no, you would tell me to take a hike. That is what we are asking when we ask people to buy T-bonds, though. \n \n The other problem with cutting entitlement programs, which pretty much means SS and medicare, is that your average baby boomer only has about $100,000 in savings which is not NEARLY enough. I have certain moral qualms about telling people who have been paying into SS their entire lives and including the promised income in their retirment planning, that now they are just going to have to starve to death quietly. \n \n Now mediCADE we could cut completely without the sticky debt default issues and without defaulting on lifelong promises. If we coupled it with an overhaul of the US medical system (badly needed) it could actually work out to be a GOOD thing for people. \n \n This is all semantics, of course, because nobody is actually going to do anything until Americans are starving in the street and by then it will be too late. IMO the best course of action would be to immediatly cut military spending to the bone. I agree we need to be able to defend ourselves. I also recognize that \"defending\" ourselves has nothing to do with keeping massive military presences in Japan, Korea, Iraq, or Europe. That is about projection of force and expanding our sphere of influence and we jsut cannot afford that #### anymore. \n \n I think we also should institute means testing for Social Security. Make sure that those who need it get it first. People like my father, who is not actually even retired yet but is already pulling $200,000 per year in pension benefits from 2 different sources as well as pulling significant income from investments and various businesses that he owns, do not actually need social security checks to survive. \n \n I think maybe it is time to admit the fact we are going to be insolvent in short order and start acting that way. There is no question that we are going to end up defaulting on some of our debt, so we may as well try to pull what benefit we can out now while we can. I see no reason not to start making DRASTIC cuts to military spending NOW. We will end up having to do so later whether we want to or not.

China isn't exactly projecting anything and they are scary as hell. That is what we were like prior to WWII.\n\n \n People seem to miss the fact that in both WWI and WWII we did not just outfight the other guys, we out produced them. Today our industrial infrastructure is about shot. If we had to fight another WW today, we would probably lose. Despite the fact that we currently have the worlds best military, it is a one shot deal. As the war in Iraq has shown, even a small protracted conflict is enough to seriously stress our armed forces. All ou rmilitary is really good fir is an intial response. \n \n Armored vehicles are a pretty good example of what I am talking about here. Democrats point to republicans, republicans point to democrats, and everybody blames everybody else for the fact that we have struggled to provide armored vehicles to our troops in Iraq. If you look past the political garbage, you will find that the problem with getting those armored vehicles to the troops is not funding or approval, the problem is production. We have been giving millions of dollars to companies to upgrade thier production facilities to try to make up the shortfall, but evne so they are falling short. Force Protection is a good example. They produce armored vehices for the military. The marines were forced to give them a 6.2 million dollar GRANT in order to upgrade their prodcution facilities and still they were late in delivering 98% of the 122 vehicles that were ordered from them. \n \n Any shooter, or purchasing agent for a police department, knows that the price of 9mm and .223 ammo is going up by massive amounts because ammunition producers cannot keep up with military demand for it so they have shifted all available production assets to the production of military ammo, and there are still shortages. Why?? Well, according to Remington, in order to increase production of .223 and 9mm for the military, ammo makers need some new equipment that can only be purchased from either Japan or Korea, and there is a 16-24 month lag time between ordering and reciept of the machinery, then they have to build facilities around it and get it up and running. Even with over 56 million in grants from the pentagon to upgrade capacity, it is still not enough. This has left us buying our ammunition from Israel and S Korea. \n \n Is the inability to produce enough ammunition to fight even a small war actually conducive to a national defense? Doesn't the fact that we cannot produce even a relatively small number of armoroed transports ring any alarm bells with the \"defense first\" XXXXXX? During WWII, when we were TRULY an industrial power, we could design a new bomber in January and by july be producing 100 of them a DAY. Today, even with the largest military production grants in history, we cannot even produce the GROUND BASED vehicles we need. \n \n The sad, sick part of this is that a lot of the actions that have essentially rendered us dfenseless were taken in the name of national defense. Money that we REALLY NEEDED for infrastructure improvement was instead psent on Reagans idiotic arms race. This is what makes the chinese so scary. Sure, our fighters are a lot better than theirs. In fact, our fighters are probably close to 4 times as combat effective as chinese fighters. BUT, our maximum porduction capability is somewhere around 2 per week. The chinese can produce 30 PER DAY. Our production depends on a myriad of goods from around the world including (ironically enough), tool steel from china. The Chinese, on the other hand, produce everything they need to turn ou their fighters in country. There is no comparison there. We go to war with China and either we lose or it goes nuclear, in which case everybody loses. We have good front line strength, but no staying power. Once we start seeing equipment losses we are sunk because our ability to produce that equipment is extremely limited. \n \n \nAnd more people than you think are in that boat. Probably wouldn't be a bad start....but at the same time you discourage savings by saying \"if you have 'x' amount you won't get SS\". Then again, maybe not....who knows.\n\n \n I just don't see it happening except in very limited borderline cases. I know folks like my dad are not going to give up the million or so a year he pays taxes on just so he can collect a poverty level SS benefit. This is like the argument that giving out food benefits (food stamps) encourages people to be unemployed. I know several previously middle class folks who now collect food stamps. Believe me, every one of them would gladly give back the vision card in exchange for a decent paying job. \n \n \nYou are going to have to cut military and entitlements in my opinion. I realize they aren't popular options and both will result in the a depression type scenario but you can only fake it so long.\n\n \n Again, I do not disagree, I just think reality interferes here. Even if we could get a self sacrificing congress in there that would cut entitlement programs right now, they would just be voted out and a new group of vote buyers voted in the next round to give those benefits back and probably promise to increase them. \n \n I do not know what we can do on the miltary front. It seems that people have forgotten the lessons of WWII. During WWII it was widely understood that it was not just the guys fighting at the front that were fighting the war, but also the men and women working in the shipyards and working on factory production lines. Victory ships were understood to be just as important to winning the war as bombers were.

The surge in commodity costs is ``creating an inflationary stress which is complicating the Federal Reserve's attempts to respond,''\n \n \n And hyperinflation is obviously the answer. \n \n And some idiotic responses:\n \n \n``They wouldn't be cutting rates in the face of accelerating inflation, and a weakening U.S. dollar, unless they were very concerned'' about the risk of recession, said Paul Kasriel, director of economic research at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. ``It is a tricky situation.'' \n\n \n Wholesale inflation is already at a 27 year high. CPI is at a 17 year high. The fed is NOT cutting rates in the face of that because they are concerned about a recession. They are cutting rates because they are concerned about a full blow depression, if not a complete collapse of our financial system. IT IS THAT BAD. It is not \"a tricky situation\" it IS \"the perfect storm\".\n \n That said, the only actual choice they are facing is whether we want high inflation, or hyperinflation. Apparently they believe that hyperinflation is the better option. Nothing the fed can possibly do will make all that bad debt floating around good. You cannot borrow your way out of trouble that you got into by borrowing too much. The world does not work that way. The \"wealth effect\" is a myth.\n \n Back to bernanke:\n \n \n``We have to make our policy in trying to balance these different risks in a way that will get the best possible outcome of the American economy,'' \n\n \n Hmm...so a ruined financial market and a currency that trades on par with the peso is the best possible outcome he can imagine? \n \n \nAdjusted for the three-month annualized rate of the personal consumption expenditures price index, minus food and energy, the target federal funds rate is 0.3 percent. \n \n Keeping so-called real interest rates near zero ``is not something you want to do for a sustained period,'' the Fed chief said today. \n\n \n Why not? And where the hell do they find all these people who do not eat???\n \n \n``There probably will be some bank failures,'' Bernanke said. ``There are, for example, some small, or, in many cases, de novo banks that are heavily invested in real estate in locales where prices have fallen.'' \n\n \n But the big banks that are holding hundreds of billions in toxic subprime trash and hundreds of billions in leveraged derivatives that are based on that trash are in FINE shape.\n \n \nHe added that ``capital ratios remain good'' for the largest banks. ``I don't anticipate any serious problems of that sort among the large, internationally active banks that make up a very substantial part of our banking system.'' \n\n \n -18 billion in non borrowed reserves is well capitalized? \n \n \n``From an economic point of view, it's a global market --on the foreign exchange market, currencies are traded all the time,'' Bernanke said. ``If I want to buy a barrel of oil, I can do it in euros or yen or any other way I like.'' \n\n \n I am assuming that bernanke is too smart to jsut flat out lie to congress, so what he means here is that if he had euros or yen and wanted to buy oil he could exchange it for dollars and then buy it. OR, he means he could buy it from Venezuela, Iran, or Russia, since those are the only nations that accept non dollar payments for oil. Oil purchases are the ONLY reason most nations hold dollar reserves. Trade oil in another currency and they have no reason to hold them at all. \n \n The sad thing is that there are actually people dumb enough to believe this #### coming from our leaders. Keep the sheep calm for the final sheering.",
