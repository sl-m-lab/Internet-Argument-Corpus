   "Here in Latvia many Lettish legionaries voluntarily took part in murders of more than 30 thousand Jews in 1941-42. Still far as I know Latvia rates low in Vizental Centre list of countries involved in the hunting program of Nazi war criminals \"Last Chance\". The only action of the Latvian gov-t was the charge against Conrad Kaleis a former officer of the Arais battalion found in Australia. And he died before his extradition to Riga. \n We are sure that most Nazi myrmidons are quietly living in Latvia publicly marking anniversaries of SS every year. But cynical Latvian officials used the program as a legal base to start seeking ... for KGB staffers instead and all 'not-loyal' people here. There is info firstly these are going to be Jews with KGB background! The next go will be chasing of all Jews I guess. The \"Last Chance\" program has clearly provoked a raging of Anti-Semitism in Latvia! People of Jewish origin can't get well-positioned job here and desecration of Jewish graves and sacred places is common practice. Nazi in Germany started it the same way.\n We hope that European structures will help Vizental Center and Jewish diaspora of Latvia. Baltic states were chosen as a starting point of the hunt for Nazis not just accidentally. In those countries not only local Jews but thousands of Jewish deportees from France, Germany, Austria and other countries were exterminated as well.",
