   "It is a long standing theory that every anti argument is based upon lies, fallacies (fraud) and majority oppression. In this reference file we shall go over the common arguments and examine how each of the three pillars apply.\n \n The ultimate point of this reference thread is to allow quick and easy refutation of the ad-naseum arguments the anti- regurgitate, and force them to slowly (or hopefully quickly) abandon many of their old arguments, and then force them to concetrate on what their arguments are based upon, which are the three pillars of lies, fallacies and majority oppression.\n \n I will be slowly adding installments, and please feel free to PM me with ideas, constructive criticism and anything I may have missed. Remember though, we're trying to get the main ones and the common variations of them.\n \n The natural argument:   \n Basically the argument is that if it is not natural, then therefore it is wrong. Obviously there are some blatant problems with the logic. Anyone can name at least 50 things they do on a weekly basis that aren't natural, yet not a single one is being attacked by the anti-s for it \"un-naturalism\" There are a number of variations on this argument.\n \n 1)The Gay Gene: \n That if science cannot find a gene that is responsible for sexual orientation, then homosexuality is wrong and must be legislated against. Several problems exist with this argument. It is assumes that there are one or a few genes responsible for orientation. The human genome has a mere 30,000 genes, and millions of functions and traits. Simple mathematics obviously proves that one gene cannot be accountable for one trait or function alone, and those genes must be responsible for many traits and functions. Also, phenotype is not purely dictated by nature. Example: you may have the genes to be 6 foot 5, but unless you get the proper nutrition and exercises, there's no way in hell you're going to be that tall, genes or not. Not to mention we don't even know if there are genes for orientation. Second problem: science has barely begun to understand how genes function in the grand scheme of things. Any assumption that because we haven't found it now that therefore it isn't natural is silly, if not arrogantly retarded. Fallacies usually incorporated are selective observation, begging the question, error of fact among others. \n \n 2)That gays cannot reproduce. \n Serious problems exist with this one as well. Gays can reproduce. It just involves a third party. The reply to that is that gays cannot reproduce by themselves. Serious problem with that exists as well. There are millions of people in this world who have reproductive problems and require visits to doctors or surrogates. No anti- is calling for legislation against straight couples with fertility problem, yet the basis is still the same: neither gays nor straights with fertility problems can reproduce without a third party. Also, there is currently work being done on taking a egg, removing all DNA, fusing the eggs of lesbians or sperm of gays, injecting it into the egg, shocking it and then implanting in a surrogate or a partner. If and when that occurs, gays will be able to reproduce. Also, specifically modern marriage is not about reproduction. Fallacies usually incorporated are selective observation, inconsistency among others. \n \n Marriage arguments:   \n There are a number of basic marriage arguments.\n \n 1) Marriage hasn't changed/traditional marriage needs to be preserved.  \n Major problems with such arguments, for one, marriage has changed from its pagan origins to modern day. Any such claim that it hasn't is an outright lie. Pagan original marriage was merely a joining of two people. There is some argument that gays were able to be married in the Roman Catholic Church up till the 13th century. Marriage in the ancient Greek world was to secure proper inheritance rights. Marriage up till the early/mid 18th century can easily be classified as man and property. During America's late slave period, only whites could get married. Till the 1960s, many states barred interracial marriages. Marriage is a concept that has changed pretty radically over the ages and any claim that it has not is a lie. On to traditional marriage, what is traditional marriage? Depends on who you ask. Marriage is originally a pagan idea. Modern marriage has very little to do with religion. Besides, the argument of sanctity of religion is a complete lie. A marriage has value by what its two participants put into it, not what society says, and if we used the current divorce rates, which top out around 56%, a large number of the straights aren't putting much value into the system. The sanctity of religion is what each participant makes of it, not what the church or society says. \n Fallacies usually incorporated: selective observation, argument via laziness, among others\n \n 2) Marriage is about reproduction and therefore gays shouldn't be allowed to marry. \n Total lie. There is no law saying anything about reproduction and marriage. In fact, there are millions of marriages that don't produce kids, and people who cannot physically have children for various reasons are still allowed to get married. There isn't a single anti saying that straight infertile, elderly and sterile should not be able to get married. It's hypocritical to argue that because of reproduction that gays shouldn't be allowed even when millions of unable straight are able to get married. Fallacies usually incorporated are selective observation. \n \n 3) Gays will cause the downfall of marriage and society. \n Not entirely sure how to deal with this one. It's so out there that it's almost laughable. Antis usually cite the Roman Empire and Greek Empires as examples of where gay behavior and acceptable lead to the downfall of marriage and society. They are either lying or don't know their history. Rome fell because of internal infighting, an overextended military presence, and the fact it was based upon conquest. The Greeks fell because they lacked the military strength after Alexander; they also fell to the Ottomans and Romans for the same reason. There's no proof that homosexuality or acceptance of it has led to the fall of society or marriage anywhere. Also, this could be a distraction away from how many straights are driving the concept of marriage into the ground themselves. \n \n 4) Disease, that because gays have a higher rate of disease, that therefore they shouldn't be allowed to get married. \n Major problems with this argument. For one, all of the diseases gays face, straight do as well. Not to mention that marriage is a known partner reducer, so in reality letting them get married reduces transfer rates of diseases, and therefore less disease is spread. It's pretty basic. Usually retort is that how many gays are monogamous? It really doesn't matter, and it's pointless because no one knows. Many straights aren't either and the problem isn't specifically marriage, but that of sexual protection. Also, many straights are also passing diseases around at high rates and no anti is saying that straights should be barred for the same reason. Also, they ignore that if you have a disease, they cannot legally bar you from marrying.",

   "You left out several (and didn't do a very good job representing the ones you DID mention).\n \n One is that technically, because both gays and straight people both have the same right to marry right now (opposite sex, as that's the marriage standard here) there really is no discrimination. It's just that gay people don't want that, and want something over and above the rights everyone else has. Therefore they want special rights. There's no fallacy there.\n \n Another is that marriage benefits themselves are really unconstitutional. They give out benefits by discriminating on the basis of marital status. But this discriminates against ANY couple who want them but don't want to get married, and in some cases discriminates against single people by giving benefits to married people that single people don't have. Marriage benefits, while usually referred to by the gay lobby as \"rights\" (an obvious attempt to self-identify with the civil rights movement) are really just benefits as given by the govt. based on certain criteria. Its not unlike social security which gives benefits based on age (62 and over). If a gay person (who doesn't fit society's standard for marriage, of course) demands marriage benefits, a 20 year-old might as well be able to demand social security benefits on the basis he might die and never see them when he's older.\n \n Also, the entire pro-gay-marriage lobby commits a major logical fallacy on the front end every time it raises it's selfish head: by saying gay people are being denied rights, it begs the question that marriage should be redefined in the first place rather than noting the simple fact that gay couples don't fit society's standard for marriage. IOW it begs the question that what gays have counts as a \"marriage\": an institutionalization of homosexuality.\n \n Also, your post leaves out the possibility that the needs of gay couples can be met in ways that don't require marriage to be redefined in this country. If enough states take up civil unions as in the state of Vermont, they could become portable and meet these needs. Some, in an invalid and unproven comparison to the civil rights movement, refer to that as separate but equal. Yet gay people ARE separate--have same-gender relationships, not opposite gender ones. It's not an issue of everyone drinking from the same water fountain, but rather two different types of marriage getting made legal.

It's just that gay people don't want that, and want something over and above the rights everyone else has. Therefore they want special rights. There's no fallacy there.\n\n \n There is a fallacy here, actually. I have argued against this case in the past. The argument you listed above rests on the assumption that if everyone has precisely the same rights, then there is no discrimination. This is not true at all. For example, if I create a law which states that no one has to pay taxes except those who attends Christian churches, I could claim that this is not discrimination. I could say that anyone can just choose not to engage in the specific behavior of attending Christian churches to recieve the benefit of not paying taxes. However the clause which prevents people from recieving those benefits is directed specifically at Christians. In order for Christians to recieve the benefit, they must stop doing Christian things. That is still discrimination. In the same fashion, anyone can choose to marry a member of the opposite-sex instead of the same sex. Yet for a homosexual to do this, he must stop doing that which is considered homosexual. A homosexual only gets marriage benefits if he stops being homosexual. Even though everyone has the same rights, this is the very definition of discrimination, inequality, and the destruction of freedom.\n \n \nAnother is that marriage benefits themselves are really unconstitutional. They give out benefits by discriminating on the basis of marital status. But this discriminates against ANY couple who want them but don't want to get married, and in some cases discriminates against single people by giving benefits to married people that single people don't have. Marriage benefits, while usually referred to by the gay lobby as \"rights\" (an obvious attempt to self-identify with the civil rights movement) are really just benefits as given by the govt. based on certain criteria. Its not unlike social security which gives benefits based on age (62 and over). If a gay person (who doesn't fit society's standard for marriage, of course) demands marriage benefits, a 20 year-old might as well be able to demand social security benefits on the basis he might die and never see them when he's older.\n\n \n Every benefit is the same as a right. I could as easily look at freedom of speech and say, \"Well, this isn't a right, it is a benefit. So I can just pick and choose who I give it to. You have to meet the government-specified criteria to get the benefit of freedom of speech.\" In truth, what we refer to as a \"benefit\" is the same thing as a right which is granted to some yet denied to others in every case. Every benefit attacks equality. Every single one. But it is reasonable to attack equality to protect happiness. Look at social security; can any one of us deny that a 20-year-old with no social security recieves the same treatment as a 65-year-old who gets it? No way; the 65-year-old gets free money! That isn't equal at all. But we do it for a reason; we do it because that 65-year-old cannot support himself. We take away equality from the 20-year-old so that the 65-year-old might have some money to live. It isn't equal, but we have a good reason for it. But same-sex couples have the same needs as opposite-sex couples, and there is no good reason to deny same-sex marriage.\n \n \nAlso, the entire pro-gay-marriage lobby commits a major logical fallacy on the front end every time it raises it's selfish head: by saying gay people are being denied rights, it begs the question that marriage should be redefined in the first place rather than noting the simple fact that gay couples don't fit society's standard for marriage. IOW it begs the question that what gays have counts as a \"marriage\": an institutionalization of homosexuality.\n\n \n This is technically a logical fallacy, as everyone has the same rights, yet it is effectually correct. Everyone knows that in order for gays to get married, they have to stop being gay, and that is effectively a denial of the right to be married. The fact that gay couples do not fit society's standard for marriage is precisely what has caused this discrimination in the first place. Because society defines marriage; it is clear that the gay rights movement is asking society to extend the definition of marriage. It does not beg any questions.\n \n \nAlso, your post leaves out the possibility that the needs of gay couples can be met in ways that don't require marriage to be redefined in this country. If enough states take up civil unions as in the state of Vermont, they could become portable and meet these needs. Some, in an invalid and unproven comparison to the civil rights movement, refer to that as separate but equal. Yet gay people ARE separate--have same-gender relationships, not opposite gender ones. It's not an issue of everyone drinking from the same water fountain, but rather two different types of marriage getting made legal. And therefore marriage as an institution gets a lot more open-ended.\n\n \n There are two problems with civil unions, each one in itself being enough to make them worthless. First, if we allow only civil unions, then we deny the title of marriage. Civil unions exist as something which any couple can engage in; they are not a special term for same-sex couples. So anyone can engage in a civil union, but only the special opposite-sex couples get the prestigious title of marriage. Such a denial of the title of marriage is as surely the destruction of freedom and equality as is the denial of any other rights. Perhaps you would better understand if Christianity could not legally be referred to as a \"religion\", but only as a \"civil cult\". \"Yeah, we'll give the same benefits to 'civil cults' as we do to religions, but Christianity just isn't a religion.\" The denial of that title means something.\n \n Furthermore, although marriage and civil unions may begin equal, they will never remain equal. The fact that they are two seperate institutions means specifically that they are not the same thing under the law, and they will be treated as such. People will pass laws that apply only to marriage and laws that apply only to civil unions. If we assume them to be different today, politicians will assume that they were meant to be different tomorrow. There is no reason to encourage this destruction of freedom and equality.",

   "It is a long standing theory that every anti argument is based upon lies, fallacies (fraud) and majority oppression. In this reference file we shall go over the common arguments and examine how each of the three pillars apply.\n \n The ultimate point of this reference thread is to allow quick and easy refutation of the ad-naseum arguments the anti- regurgitate, and force them to slowly (or hopefully quickly) abandon many of their old arguments, and then force them to concetrate on what their arguments are based upon, which are the three pillars of lies, fallacies and majority oppression.\n \n I will be slowly adding installments, and please feel free to PM me with ideas, constructive criticism and anything I may have missed. Remember though, we're trying to get the main ones and the common variations of them.\n \n The natural argument:   \n Basically the argument is that if it is not natural, then therefore it is wrong. Obviously there are some blatant problems with the logic. Anyone can name at least 50 things they do on a weekly basis that aren't natural, yet not a single one is being attacked by the anti-s for it \"un-naturalism\" There are a number of variations on this argument.\n \n 1)The Gay Gene: \n That if science cannot find a gene that is responsible for sexual orientation, then homosexuality is wrong and must be legislated against. Several problems exist with this argument. It is assumes that there are one or a few genes responsible for orientation. The human genome has a mere 30,000 genes, and millions of functions and traits. Simple mathematics obviously proves that one gene cannot be accountable for one trait or function alone, and those genes must be responsible for many traits and functions. Also, phenotype is not purely dictated by nature. Example: you may have the genes to be 6 foot 5, but unless you get the proper nutrition and exercises, there's no way in hell you're going to be that tall, genes or not. Not to mention we don't even know if there are genes for orientation. Second problem: science has barely begun to understand how genes function in the grand scheme of things. Any assumption that because we haven't found it now that therefore it isn't natural is silly, if not arrogantly retarded. Fallacies usually incorporated are selective observation, begging the question, error of fact among others. \n \n 2)That gays cannot reproduce. \n Serious problems exist with this one as well. Gays can reproduce. It just involves a third party. The reply to that is that gays cannot reproduce by themselves. Serious problem with that exists as well. There are millions of people in this world who have reproductive problems and require visits to doctors or surrogates. No anti- is calling for legislation against straight couples with fertility problem, yet the basis is still the same: neither gays nor straights with fertility problems can reproduce without a third party. Also, there is currently work being done on taking a egg, removing all DNA, fusing the eggs of lesbians or sperm of gays, injecting it into the egg, shocking it and then implanting in a surrogate or a partner. If and when that occurs, gays will be able to reproduce. Also, specifically modern marriage is not about reproduction. Fallacies usually incorporated are selective observation, inconsistency among others. \n \n Marriage arguments:   \n There are a number of basic marriage arguments.\n \n 1) Marriage hasn't changed/traditional marriage needs to be preserved.  \n Major problems with such arguments, for one, marriage has changed from its pagan origins to modern day. Any such claim that it hasn't is an outright lie. Pagan original marriage was merely a joining of two people. There is some argument that gays were able to be married in the Roman Catholic Church up till the 13th century. Marriage in the ancient Greek world was to secure proper inheritance rights. Marriage up till the early/mid 18th century can easily be classified as man and property. During America's late slave period, only whites could get married. Till the 1960s, many states barred interracial marriages. Marriage is a concept that has changed pretty radically over the ages and any claim that it has not is a lie. On to traditional marriage, what is traditional marriage? Depends on who you ask. Marriage is originally a pagan idea. Modern marriage has very little to do with religion. Besides, the argument of sanctity of religion is a complete lie. A marriage has value by what its two participants put into it, not what society says, and if we used the current divorce rates, which top out around 56%, a large number of the straights aren't putting much value into the system. The sanctity of religion is what each participant makes of it, not what the church or society says. \n Fallacies usually incorporated: selective observation, argument via laziness, among others\n \n 2) Marriage is about reproduction and therefore gays shouldn't be allowed to marry. \n Total lie. There is no law saying anything about reproduction and marriage. In fact, there are millions of marriages that don't produce kids, and people who cannot physically have children for various reasons are still allowed to get married. There isn't a single anti saying that straight infertile, elderly and sterile should not be able to get married. It's hypocritical to argue that because of reproduction that gays shouldn't be allowed even when millions of unable straight are able to get married. Fallacies usually incorporated are selective observation. \n \n 3) Gays will cause the downfall of marriage and society. \n Not entirely sure how to deal with this one. It's so out there that it's almost laughable. Antis usually cite the Roman Empire and Greek Empires as examples of where gay behavior and acceptable lead to the downfall of marriage and society. They are either lying or don't know their history. Rome fell because of internal infighting, an overextended military presence, and the fact it was based upon conquest. The Greeks fell because they lacked the military strength after Alexander; they also fell to the Ottomans and Romans for the same reason. There's no proof that homosexuality or acceptance of it has led to the fall of society or marriage anywhere. Also, this could be a distraction away from how many straights are driving the concept of marriage into the ground themselves. \n \n 4) Disease, that because gays have a higher rate of disease, that therefore they shouldn't be allowed to get married. \n Major problems with this argument. For one, all of the diseases gays face, straight do as well. Not to mention that marriage is a known partner reducer, so in reality letting them get married reduces transfer rates of diseases, and therefore less disease is spread. It's pretty basic. Usually retort is that how many gays are monogamous? It really doesn't matter, and it's pointless because no one knows. Many straights aren't either and the problem isn't specifically marriage, but that of sexual protection. Also, many straights are also passing diseases around at high rates and no anti is saying that straights should be barred for the same reason. Also, they ignore that if you have a disease, they cannot legally bar you from marrying.\n\n \n The basic problem with the above is that it assumes that the antis will think and react objectively and rationally. As can well be seen, they either can't or won't.",
