But there is a time limit on their repentance. Either until the day they die, or until God decides they have gone too far. Fortunately, none of us know what that limit would be for anyone including ourselves. That is why Jesus said \"Do not judge others.\"",

I could pretend to be a Hindu, but that does not make it so. You are making the mistake of judging Christians according to the actions of those who are not truely converted. The bible has more warnings about \"wolves in sheeps clothing,\" than about secularists. \n \n Jesus said:\n \n Not everyone who says to Me, \"Lord, Lord,' shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. Many will say to Me in that day, \"Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name..and done many wonders in Your name?' And then I will declare to them, \"I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!' Matt. 7:21-23",
