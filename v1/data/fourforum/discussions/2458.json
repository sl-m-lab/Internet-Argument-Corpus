   "briefly heard about the FBI (I think) about possible suicide bombings in the U.S. They had said that there weren't any clues suggesting that an attack was imminent but that it a possibility to the future. I was listening to steve mulsberg (correct spelling?) on conservative 770 am radio last night. Oddly I agreed with him when he said that he's suprised there hasn't been a bombing of this sort yet on U.S. soil. It is a scary reality that in this world people would wish to carry out such attacks on our nation. And it as scary to think we would like to do the same to others, while not in the form of suicide bomb. However I didn't enjoy the twisting that seemed to be going on. It seems that conservative radio is trying to use 9/11 and the possibities of further attacks to drive on the notion that as Americans we should be pro-Israeli as possible. Radio hosts will say things such as, \"Unfortunately a time may come when we feel how Israel feels.\" The difference is we haven't been occupying Al Qaeda for 37 years and Al Qaeda doesn't have a specified land, rather their energy is based on religion. So this easy comparison to Al Qaeda and affiliates, to the suicide bombings in Israel is a whole lot of spin, a handful of propaganda and a fear tactic to paint the Palestinian people as the aggressors rather then the receivers of isolation and brutatlity. The patriot that I am, I will send a final message to the neocons and hard line Israeli supporters, don't be afraid of what has happened on 9/11, we must regroup and preservere. Using our tragedy as a reason to further the brutality of innocent people 6000 miles away is a slap in the face to the victims and their families of 9/11 and joining the two is just plain wrong. \n \n Remi",

They have drawn back (in reality been beaten back) before, but they have never fully withdrawn as is required under international law and UN resolution. IF tey did, I think there is a chance the violence would lessen in intensity. I doubt it would stop alltogether just because of he years of brutality towards th palestenians, which will not be forgotten so easily.\n \n As far as the PA goes, if Israel would quite puilling their teeth, maybe they actually COULD do something. This is an old trick that Israel has played for years, and I think that it is a real statement about a persons gullibillity when they continue to fall for it. Look at what Israel did with Arafat. They went after the guy, destryed his organisation, pulled any power he had, then when they realised that the violence was only increasing, they called on Arafat and pointe dthe finger at him to stop the attacks. THey ad already destroyed any power he had, intentionally put him in a position where he was powerless to stop the attacks, then used his \"failure\" to do so as justification for continuing hostilities. They have been doing this kind of thing for YEARS.\n \n Peace in the Iraeli conflict is easy. EITHER have israel pull out of the occupied territories and pay reperations to the Palestenians for their brutality, OR make the palestenians citizens. They will quickly outnumber the ews in Israel, and run the country as THEY wish for a while.\n \n Either solution woud be just, and either solution would end the violence.",

   "Tell me where most Palestinians live. :) A hint... it's not the West Bank.\n\n \n You are missing the point. The majority of the people in the west bank and the gaza strip have lived there for generations. \n \n If you really want to argue about whether or not the Jordanians are Palestenians, I would suggest you ask one. You will not find one who agrees with you. THere is a pretty decent history of jordan at http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/history.html. IF you don't feel like wading through the whole thing, I will give you the highlights of Jordans creation. First off, it was NEVER created as a palestenian state. It was carved out of the ottoman empire during the Arab revolt (circa 1918). Secon, Jordan is over 80% Beduin. Beduin are NOT palestenians. Third, while jordan is compoased of part of what the Romans called palestine, this was not based on any kind of factual foundation. The British during WWII called the whole area \"Arabia\". Does that mean that the entire area should be united as a single country called \"ARabia\"? No.\n \n \nWhich just shows why the UN is so useless. The UN can't even act when genocide happens, so you shouldn't expect it to do anything now.\n\n \n Or it shows how the US has used its influence in the UN to promote genocide and racism. \n \n \nI don't know how people can believe that all of this will end as soon as Israel pulls out of the territories.

I think if Israel did this, the violence would end a lot quicker. There woudl be a reasonably short period (maybe 20 years at the most) where Israel would suffer from some attacks. This to be expected when you treat people as the Israelis have treated the palestenians. If one group kills a fw hundred thousand of another, there is going to be retrobution. \n \n If after WWII, we had left Hitler in control of GErmany and had not required reform from Germanys government, people would have been most unhappy.

Your mom? You ned t wake up and think about this. right now, the border of ISrael (including the occupied territories) is fairly porous. IT is so big that Israel cannot afford to gueard it all. They pull their troops back to their border and secure it (Their real border, not the border of the illegallty occupied lands) and they will be in a much better position to defend their border.\n \n \nIt won't stop when Israel pulls out. It will never stop until the Palestinian militants are crushed or every Israeli in the region is dead. It's not about freedom from the Israelis... that's only been the case for only about 40 years. \n \n \n As to the first part, you are just spouting rhetoric. Nobody knows what would happen, and there is absolutly no proof to back your claim. \n \n Since the very beginning it has been about freedom from the israelis.

Arafat is a terrorist, always has been a terrorist, and always will be a terrorist.

It wasn't until 1964 that he even became actively involved int hte conflict. Up until that point he has published an underground magaz8ine from Kuwait, and smuggled arms from egypt (he was 17 then). IS he a terrorist, or a fredom fighter? HE is opposing an illegal occupying force, to my mind that makes him a freedom fighter. I think that is damn near the definition of freedom fighter.\n \n If you really want to know who started using terrorism in the conflict, I would suggest you look up Haganah, the Irgun Zvai Leumi and the Stern Gang. THese were zionist terrorist groups. One of them was carrying out attackc before Arafat was even born. \n \n It could be more correctly argued that Israel is a terrorist state, has always been a terrorist state, and will always be a terrorist state.

If one group kills a fw hundred thousand of another, there is going to be retrobution. \n\n \n I don't really buy into this idea and I'll tell you why. You have Jews and Arabs who are two groups who dislike each other. The solution is probably not going to be for either one to beg for forgiveness and bribe them for peace. That would only encourage the other group to continue marching forward. This is similar to the US policy of not dealing with terrorism. If we started giving them whatever they asked for we would have to deal with it far more often and at a great cost to ourselves. You cannot end this sort of thing by just paying them off. You have to end it in a way that ends up with both sides feeling as if they are respected by the other side. Using bribery would only insult one side as if money or land can make up for the damages and make the other look week.\n \n \nIf after WWII, we had left Hitler in control of GErmany and had not required reform from Germanys government, people would have been most unhappy. Proportionatly, Hitler killed fewer jews than the Israelis have palestenians. \n\n \n If in WWII Hitler had been invaded by Jews and killed them then he would be in the same situation Israel is with the Palestinians and I wouldn't feel much sympathy for those who were killed. So the Hitler analogy just doesn't hold up here. The Palestinians are getting killed because they keep asking for more death on both sides. Of course not everyone who dies is directly involved in any military actions but that is to be expected in combat. At least Israel isn't going directly after civilians like the Palestinians are even though I do grant you that the Palestinians don't have the means to fight a noble war avoiding civilian casualties.\n \n \nWho told you this? Your mom? You ned t wake up and think about this. right now, the border of ISrael (including the occupied territories) is fairly porous. IT is so big that Israel cannot afford to gueard it all. They pull their troops back to their border and secure it (Their real border, not the border of the illegallty occupied lands) and they will be in a much better position to defend their border.\n\n \n Hey lets drop the gloves and bring our mothers into this why don't we? Also lets use some logic to test your theory. OK the US is being attacked by terrorists and we cannot seem to contain them. Lets pull back to just California, let the terrorists occupy the rest of our land, and see how well we can hold them off then. First off we would lose much of our economic power and much of our population to our enemies who would grow in strength. Our military would have no choice but to cut back in size leaving us once again weaker on our borders. So in review our enemy is stronger and we are back to our old border strength. No, this doesn't add up.\n \n \n \nAs to the first part, you are just spouting rhetoric. Nobody knows what would happen, and there is absolutly no proof to back your claim.\n\n \n Aren't you the one who stated \"There woudl be a reasonably short period (maybe 20 years at the most) where Israel would suffer from some attacks\"? So much for nobody knows what would happen eh? So lets just be realistic and not go after each other for making educated guesses on what the outcome would be for a certain action. You can debate that they are wrong but you can't just state that they need proof to back up everything they say otherwise there would be little to debate.\n \n \nSince the very beginning it has been about freedom from the israelis. They should not have been given the country wihout some guidance as to how it would have to be set up. The very first thing the jews did after taking power was relocate the local palestenians. They stole their lands, their homes, didn't allow them citizenship. \n\n \n Isn't this exactly what the US did to the Mexicans? Does this mean we should keep allowing illegal immigration and eventually just hand over the land to them?\n \n \nAll the militabnts call for now is the return of their land that was illegally seized. Realistically, they would be justified in demanding the disolution of the state of Isreal and the resturn of their population to their pre WWII homes. The palestenians have already conceded more than the ISraelis deserve.\n\n \n Hmmm. So you think that Israel should go with the UN resolution and give back some of the land but you don't agree with the UN resolution that gave them their land in the first place? So basically we can just throw the whole opinion of the UN out when debating this with you? Assuming we cannot use the UN's judgment on who should control the land then it comes down to who really deserves it. Israel who was attacked and fought for the land or the Palestinians who had it before Israel turned back their armies and got the land? I could debate that Israel has already conceded more land than their neighbors deserve. Israel had a couple chances to take key areas of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan but gave them all back. As I see it sure Israel has land they shouldn't have but their neighbors have land they shouldn't have. It is quite a fair trade off IMO.\n \n \nArafat started the violence? It wasn't until 1964 that he even became actively involved int hte conflict. Up until that point he has published an underground magaz8ine from Kuwait, and smuggled arms from egypt (he was 17 then). IS he a terrorist, or a fredom fighter? HE is opposing an illegal occupying force, to my mind that makes him a freedom fighter. I think that is damn near the definition of freedom fighter.\n\n \n Freedom fighters and terrorists are one in the same generally. He is both. However I think that without him there would be a better chance of a lasting peace. This makes me think Palestine should find themselves a new freedom fighter who looks to actually resolve this situation instead of just keep it going forever and ever.\n \n \nIt could be more correctly argued that Israel is a terrorist state, has always been a terrorist state, and will always be a terrorist state. THere is absolutly no doubt that they started the violence, and absolutly no doubt that they are the only ones who can stop it.\n\n \n Why is there no doubt they stared the violence and they are the only ones who can stop it? This is quite a certain statement you have made for something that is based on opinion. We could just as easily debate Hitler started it all by attacking the Jews which later led to Israel being formed by the British which in turn led to the war not because of the Israelis or Palestinians but rather by the fact that the two were put too close together not to cause friction. Or you could debate that the invasions of Israel which led to them gaining the land they illegally hold today led to the conflict. It is not a cut and dry issue here. Also as far as who can end it, if the Palestinians draw up an actual plan that they would satisfied with which is fair to Israel it is quite possible the US will support it as well as the UN and could become policy. If the Palestinians decide that it is not just all or nothing then they could just as well end all the fighting politically.\n \n \nUnfortunatly, this is not likely to happen until the palestenians kill enough people. Until they can come up with a tactical nuke, or some serios chem/bio weapons (And saddams imaginary ones are not likely to help much), bombing busses and such is the best they can do. Maybe eventually the Israeli people will wake up and recognise that the problem is not going to go away. Alternatively, maybe the rest of the world will eventually get fed up enough that they will form a \"Coalition of the willing\" without US support, and go in there and set things right.\n\n \n If the terrorists use a tactical nuke I doubt it would further their cause. The Israelis would go hard core on their enemies worse than ever. Arafat would quickly be killed along with other known leaders of the Palestinian movements. Countries harboring these people would no longer feel safe as Israel would freely invade them to secure themselves and we all know they are capable of doing so. The UN would probably want to prevent this from happening but that could only be arranged if they sent in a massive force to strike against those who caused the attack which inevitably would be the same 'terrorists' the Israelis want killed anyways. So if the Palestinians want to take it to the next level that is up to them. I wouldn't expect the Israelis to just roll over like you seem to believe they would.\n \n I wish to see this all getting resolved but in my opinion the only way to resolve this who issue is with both sides leaving the table feeling respect for each other. WWI ended with the world not feeling respect for Germany and it resulted in WWII. WWII ended with the world giving the people of Germany and Japan respect which in turn led to them respecting us. Unfortunately this was not accomplished before devastating their respective countries. I'm not sure how it can be accomplished in this conflict but if we ever want to see peace it will probably have to occur this way.",

   "How about just up until the formation of the UN, and Israel acceptance into that body, where they agreed to live by the rules of the UN, one of which is we do not take land from our neiborghing countries.\n\n \n Why then so arbitrary a date? But, even accepting this let's support Jewish claims for parts of Yemen - and other Arab nations where they were expelled upon the creation of the Israeli state.\n \n \nI mean the people whose direct decendantss have been living on those same plots of land, tending those same olive fields, for over a thousand years. This isn't a hard cocept.\n\n \n Hang on, I thought you wanted to date this claim to 1948! Now it's thousands of years. I believe you need make up your mind.\n \n \nNo, because \"Islam\" did not evict them.\n\n \n Semantics. The Islamic state did. What used to be their temple site, is now a mosque - or are you suggesting the Jews just gave up their most holy site?\n \n \nIsrael either needs to either pull out of the occupied territories, or needs to be froced to stop their racist policies regarding citizenship. IF they want to grant all the palestenians full citizenship, then nobody would have much to complain about (since the Jews would shortly be outnumbered and be forced to live by the same rules as everbody else).\n\n \n Do you think that Egypt should pay compensation to the Jews it expelled after 1948? Libya did it, Algeria did it.\n \n Their attitude was \"You've now got a state of your own... f -off\"",

   " If you really want to argue about whether or not the Jordanians are Palestenians (sic), I would suggest you ask one. You will not find one who agrees with you. THere is a pretty decent history of jordan at http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/history.html. IF you don't feel like wading through the whole thing, I will give you the highlights of Jordans creation. First off, it was NEVER created as a palestenian (sic) state. It was carved out of the ottoman empire during the Arab revolt (circa 1918). Secon (sic), Jordan is over 80% Beduin. Beduin (sic) are NOT palestenians (sic). Third, while jordan is compoased (sic) of part of what the Romans called palestine, this was not based on any kind of factual foundation. The British during WWII called the whole area \"Arabia\". Does that mean that the entire area should be united as a single country called \"ARabia\"? No.\n\n \n So, you are defining 'Palestinian' as those people who inhabited the Roman part of Palestine, now under the control of Israel, and not that part who inhabited Palestine, now under the control of any other nation?\n \n What an absurd notion. Was Gaza part of Palestine? In fact, the Romans changed borders. For a while they had a client Jewish kingdom. Palmyra was left outside the empire for a while, then absorbed into it. You don't take this into account when defining 'Palestinian'... In fact, those Jews in Palestine are therefore 'Palestinian'... and they already own the land.\n \n By the way, the 'Arab revolt' was a minor side-show of WWI. It only succeeded because of the efforts of the Allies. Jews also fought, in WWI, and WWII. Do you think the Turks have a right to claim it back?\n \n You also forget that those 'Arabs' who revolted came from Arabia. They took a family from Arabia and made them kings of Jordan. They took another Arabian family and made them kings of Iraq. Did they consult the Jordanians or the Iraqis? No, because those nations did not exist.\n \n The whole area's borders were drawn up by the allies. So, what makes someone a 'Palestinian' as opposed to a Syrian, goes back only to the last century... not '1,000s of years' as you said in a previous posting.\n \n Why also do you not protest against the fact that the Jordanians expelled the Palestinians from their territory?\n \n \nThis to be expected when you treat people as the Israelis have treated the palestenians (sic). If one group kills a fw (sic) hundred thousand of another, there is going to be retrobution (sic). \n\n \n So, you'd expect the Jews have a right to kill Germans.\n \n The Palestinians have a right to kill Jordanians.\n \n The Armenians have a right to kill Kurds and Turks\n \n The Kurds have a right to kill Turks.\n \n Palestinians and Jordanians have a right to kill Turks.\n \n \nIf after WWII, we had left Hitler in control of Germany and had not required reform from Germanys government, people would have been most unhappy. Proportionatly (sic), Hitler killed fewer jews than the Israelis have palestenians. \n\n \n What's this 'proportionately notion you now introduce? You are trying to say that the Israelis are worse than Hitler! That's a disgusting notion. \n \n \nWho told you this? Your mom? You ned t wake up and think about this. right now, the border of ISrael (including the occupied territories) is fairly porous. IT is so big that Israel cannot afford to gueard it all. They pull their troops back to their border and secure it (Their real border, not the border of the illegallty occupied lands) and they will be in a much better position to defend their border.\n\n \n Who should own Gaza? Egypt could claim it.\n \n \nAll the militabnts (sic) call for now is the return of their land that was illegally seized. Realistically, they would be justified in demanding the disolution of the state of Isreal and the resturn of their population to their pre WWII homes. The palestenians have already conceded more than the ISraelis deserve.\n\n \n What do the Israeli's 'deserve'?\n \n It was only recently that the Palestinians took off their claim to all of the area... they had it as their political agenda that there should be NO state of Israel.\n \n \nArafat started the violence? It wasn't until 1964 that he even became actively involved int hte conflict. Up until that point he has published an underground magaz8ine (sic) from Kuwait, and smuggled arms from Egypt (he was 17 then). IS he a terrorist, or a fredom (sic) fighter? HE is opposing an illegal occupying force, to my mind that makes him a freedom fighter. I think that is damn near the definition of freedom fighter.\n\n \n He used the methods of terrorism (as did some Israelis - including their current leader). All terrorists are terrorists.\n \n \nUnfortunatly, (sic) this is not likely to happen until the palestenians kill enough people. Until they can come up with a tactical nuke, or some serios (sic) chem/bio weapons (And saddams imaginary ones are not likely to help much), bombing busses and such is the best they can do. Maybe eventually the Israeli people will wake up and recognise that the problem is not going to go away. Alternatively, maybe the rest of the world will eventually get fed up enough that they will form a \"Coalition of the willing\" without US support, and go in there and set things right.\n\n \n The Arabs are losers, they've got a non-Arab nation right smack in the middle of them, and despite numerical strength haven't been able to do much about it. Even with oil as a weapon, and billions of petro-dollars, and a rabid hankering for the Koran, they've continued to fail. All they're good at is killing a few people trying to catch a bus to work.\n \n Other Arab nations have kicked the Palestinians about - Jordan especially, because they hate each other.\n \n There's no Arab democracy anywhere.* In Iraq their killing off anyone associated with moves to a new government.\n \n In Israel there are people protesting against their government... they're able to because it's a democracy. Where is the Arab opposition parties? In Palestinian circles they are assassinated by their own side if they speak out. (assassin is based on an Arab word)\n \n You go to Saudi Arabia - you can be arrested for carrying a crucifix.\n \n In Israel you've got a sizeable part of the population who want all Israelis driven out. It is hard for a democracy to live in such an environment... at least they've got Arab incompetence to protect them.\n \n *Unless you count Lebanon which has a huge Christian population (about 50%). This is because, by nature they don't tolerate dissent.",

   "So if Israel controls it for another generation or so you would say that it is as much theirs as it is the Palestinians? Or if they removed the people who live there to another location then does it become theirs? I don't think you should use this type of argument to show who should be in control of that land. You should stick to the UN rulings.\n\n \n IF they controll it for another 50 generations, maybe. This isn;t going to happen, though. Israel is setting itself up for a major failure here. More andmore of the world is supporting the palestenians, and there is some grumbling in the American public. \n \n \n \nEven if this is the case it still shows the uselessness of the UN. If one country can break down the entire UN system all by itself then the UN isn't worth a darn.\n\n \n When they set up the UN, certain countries insisted on being permanent SC members and having Veto power. This was a bad idea. Maybe it is time to change it. America has been the greatest supporter of this (keeping it the same). Ameica doesn't like the idea exactly because Israel would have been solved long ago if we didn;t have Veto power, and thus power to push around the SC. There have been multiple resolutions presented over the years tat would have resulted in a UN mandated takeover of Israel. WE have alays threated to veto it unless the threat of force was removed. \n \n \nI don't really buy into this idea and I'll tell you why. You have Jews and Arabs who are two groups who dislike each other. The solution is probably not going to be for either one to beg for forgiveness and bribe them for peace. That would only encourage the other group to continue marching forward. This is similar to the US policy of not dealing with terrorism. If we started giving them whatever they asked for we would have to deal with it far more often and at a great cost to ourselves. You cannot end this sort of thing by just paying them off. You have to end it in a way that ends up with both sides feeling as if they are respected by the other side. Using bribery would only insult one side as if money or land can make up for the damages and make the other look week.\n\n \n So your solution is to, what, just let Israel walk away without having to answer for their crimes? Accounts must be balanced if there is to be any hope of peace. \n \n \n \nIf in WWII Hitler had been invaded by Jews and killed them then he would be in the same situation Israel is with the Palestinians and I wouldn't feel much sympathy for those who were killed. So the Hitler analogy just doesn't hold up here. The Palestinians are getting killed because they keep asking for more death on both sides. Of course not everyone who dies is directly involved in any military actions but that is to be expected in combat. At least Israel isn't going directly after civilians like the Palestinians are even though I do grant you that the Palestinians don't have the means to fight a noble war avoiding civilian casualties.\n\n \n Your view on this is exactly contrary to reality. It was Israel who invaded that area. THey used terrorist tactics (sometimes against their own people to drum up international sympathy) in order to secure a homeland. After securing said homeland, they engaged in a policy of ethnic cleansing, which they continue to this day. \n \n Israel isn't goig after civilians? Whose tanks and attack helicopters were firng on the protesters last week? WHose military killed over 40,000 unarmed noncoms when invading beirut? Wose military killed over 3000 women and children shortly thereafter in refuge camps? Israel has targeted civilians for years. They recently slowed it down a bit because they couldn't take the bad press, then point their fingers and scream injustice wen a few dozen israeli civilains are killed.\n \n \n \nHey lets drop the gloves and bring our mothers into this why don't we? Also lets use some logic to test your theory. OK the US is being attacked by terrorists and we cannot seem to contain them. Lets pull back to just California, let the terrorists occupy the rest of our land, and see how well we can hold them off then. First off we would lose much of our economic power and much of our population to our enemies who would grow in strength. Our military would have no choice but to cut back in size leaving us once again weaker on our borders. So in review our enemy is stronger and we are back to our old border strength. No, this doesn't add up.\n\n \n Your logic here is warped. The Israeli Army is paid for 100% by US aid. Given a limited number of men, you can always defend a smaller area better than a bigger one. The economic lsses involved would not affect their ability to efend, becasue they are a welfare state, and the US will not let them fall ontheir butts, regardless of whether this is right or not.\n \n \n \nAren't you the one who stated \"There woudl be a reasonably short period (maybe 20 years at the most) where Israel would suffer from some attacks\"? So much for nobody knows what would happen eh? So lets just be realistic and not go after each other for making educated guesses on what the outcome would be for a certain action. You can debate that they are wrong but you can't just state that they need proof to back up everything they say otherwise there would be little to debate.\n\n \n I presented that as conjecture, not fact. That should have been clear. forthose who failed to catch that, it was conjecture. \n \n \n \nIsn't this exactly what the US did to the Mexicans? Does this mean we should keep allowing illegal immigration and eventually just hand over the land to them?\n\n \n Not exactly. Not even close. I assume you are talking about in texas. What happened there was a popular uprising by the people in the region. After the revolution, texas formed its own country for a short time, then applied for statehood into the United States. There is a big difference between that and taking by force and against the will of the population at large a slice of a neiborghing country. \n \n \n \nHmmm. So you think that Israel should go with the UN resolution and give back some of the land but you don't agree with the UN resolution that gave them their land in the first place? So basically we can just throw the whole opinion of the UN out when debating this with you? Assuming we cannot use the UN's judgment on who should control the land then it comes down to who really deserves it. Israel who was attacked and fought for the land or the Palestinians who had it before Israel turned back their armies and got the land? I could debate that Israel has already conceded more land than their neighbors deserve. Israel had a couple chances to take key areas of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan but gave them all back. As I see it sure Israel has land they shouldn't have but their neighbors have land they shouldn't have. It is quite a fair trade off IMO.\n\n \n No. Israel ever had a chance of taking and holding any more than they already have. We covered this in another thread. If you really want to get back into it, we can. Israel did manage to drive forces deep into those countries, then the US finally allowed passage of a UN resolution calling for a ceasfire. IT was not because Israel was kicking butt and taking names, it was because they had lost over 4000 men and over 5 billion dollars worht of equipment, including over a billion dollars worth that was emergency air lifted from the US. The ISraeli military was on the verge of collapse, and, the russians threatened to stop the US from providing resupply by force. This was another example of the US stepping up in the UN to cover ISraels butt. In another week, the Israeli military would have completley collapsed, and we would not be having these problems right now.\n \n \n \nFreedom fighters and terrorists are one in the same generally. He is both. However I think that without him there would be a better chance of a lasting peace. This makes me think Palestine should find themselves a new freedom fighter who looks to actually resolve this situation instead of just keep it going forever and ever.\n\n \n Anymore, it doesn't matter. Last time Israel asked him to stop the attacks, he got on TV and asked the terrorists to stop, ad they didn;t. BY taking small, measured steps against Arafat, the ISraelis have effectively rendered him impotent. He has become irrelevant, he no longer has the power to stop the violence. If they wanted to talk to somebody to stop the violence, the head of Hamas might be a good choice, as they would at least know the right people. They have assasinated the last two guys to head Hamas, though, effectively driving them underground. This is why we do not target generals during war time. If you kill all the generals, there is nobody left to sign the surrender papers. You effectively manage to make an official end to the war impossible, so you end up fighting forever. \n \n The PA is vetted by the Israelis and have no real power or funding (the billions in aid we send is spent on the Israeli citizens, not the Palestenian non-people). So, who is left for the Israelis to deal with? Nobody. They can negotiate all they want, but there is nobody left who is willing to talk to them that has the power to actually do anything but talk.\n \n \nWhy is there no doubt they stared the violence and they are the only ones who can stop it? This is quite a certain statement you have made for something that is based on opinion. We could just as easily debate Hitler started it all by attacking the Jews which later led to Israel being formed by the British which in turn led to the war not because of the Israelis or Palestinians but rather by the fact that the two were put too close together not to cause friction. Or you could debate that the invasions of Israel which led to them gaining the land they illegally hold today led to the conflict. It is not a cut and dry issue here. Also as far as who can end it, if the Palestinians draw up an actual plan that they would satisfied with which is fair to Israel it is quite possible the US will support it as well as the UN and could become policy. If the Palestinians decide that it is not just all or nothing then they could just as well end all the fighting politically.\n\n \n It is absolutly not based on opinion. The first attacks in the area in the zionist/arab conflict were made by Zionist terror groups in 1927, and it was long before hitler took power. The british didn't create israel because of what the Nazis did, they allowed for the creation of ISrael to stop the zionist terrorist attacks. The british didn;t even create israel. They saw that what the zionists wanted was unreasonable, and that the situation was unworkable, so they dropped the whole mess on other people. Crack a history book, you will learn a lot\n \n \n \nIf the terrorists use a tactical nuke I doubt it would further their cause. The Israelis would go hard core on their enemies worse than ever. Arafat would quickly be killed along with other known leaders of the Palestinian movements. Countries harboring these people would no longer feel safe as Israel would freely invade them to secure themselves and we all know they are capable of doing so. The UN would probably want to prevent this from happening but that could only be arranged if they sent in a massive force to strike against those who caused the attack which inevitably would be the same 'terrorists' the Israelis want killed anyways. So if the Palestinians want to take it to the next level that is up to them. I wouldn't expect the Israelis to just roll over like you seem to believe they would.\n\n \n Israel is small enough that their entire government could be taken out by a single tactical nuke. A good portion of their military could be taken out in the same manner, if the terrorists decided not to target the government. The myth of the undstoppable israeli military is an intersting one, but when you consider the tropp strengths of the surrounding countries, Israel is not equipped to invade them, only to defend itself. with 2 or 3 tactical nukes, you could effectively destroy the Israeli command and control structure. At that point, your military basically has the supplies they have on them at the moment, because withou command and control, there is no such thing as resupply. No military survives for long without a command structure. \n \n \nI wish to see this all getting resolved but in my opinion the only way to resolve this who issue is with both sides leaving the table feeling respect for each other. WWI ended with the world not feeling respect for Germany and it resulted in WWII. WWII ended with the world giving the people of Germany and Japan respect which in turn led to them respecting us. Unfortunately this was not accomplished before devastating their respective countries. I'm not sure how it can be accomplished in this conflict but if we ever want to see peace it will probably have to occur this way.\n\n \n In order for that to happen, Israel is going to have to give in. When you talk arabs, you are talking peple who literally keep blood fueds alive for generations. There are some fairly well known family feuds in the arab world that have been going on for over a thousand years. People seem to think that if Israel could \"get a grip\" on the situation over there that we could solvew this thing. Not when you are dealing with people like the Arabs. The arabs are far too proud to give in, and will never forget what the israelis did. In west, whihc is built primarily on christian influence, we are taght \"forgive and forget\". In the middle east, it is \"forgive, but NEVER forget\". And they (as we) certainly don't forgive until reperations have been made.\n \n montalban\nSo, you are defining 'Palestinian' as those people who inhabited the Roman part of Palestine, now under the control of Israel, and not that part who inhabited Palestine, now under the control of any other nation?\n \n What an absurd notion. Was Gaza part of Palestine? In fact, the Romans changed borders. For a while they had a client Jewish kingdom. Palmyra was left outside the empire for a while, then absorbed into it. You don't take this into account when defining 'Palestinian'... In fact, those Jews in Palestine are therefore 'Palestinian'... and they already own the land.\n\n \n No, I am definind \"Palestinian\" as a class of arab who lived in traditional palestine. I am using the traditional palestine as that area fo the middle east which has traditionally been recognised by its inhabitants, as well as by others in the region, as palestine. Palestenians have their own culture, their own dialect of arabic, and their own traditions. Palestenians in other part of the middle east stick out like sore thumbs, they even look different than other Arabs. It is western ignorance that causes us to class them all together. If you go to germany and ther is a british guy walking down the street, even if you don;t talk to him, you will most likely realise that there is something differnet about him.\n \n People who fail to understand this lump the palestenians in with all the other arabs and go \"it's the same thing\". It is not. When you see people who look radically differnt than you, and speak another language, and hold differnt customs, you do not always pick up on the little differnces that make all the difference in the world. Can you tell the differnce between a Korean and a japanese guy by looking? They look radically different once you spend some time in Asia and get used to seeing them. Until people wake up and start to recognise that the differnce between the Palestenians and the jordanians, or the palestenians and the egyptians (who often get lumped in with the arabs, though they are not arabs, and do not consider themseves uch) they are not ever going to understand what is going on and they are going to continue running aournd and sying idiotic things about jordan being a palestenian state, or about the palestenians going back to \"their\" country. Israel IS their country. If china invaded canada and expelled all the canadians to the US, would that be OK, since we are all white guys?\n \n \nBy the way, the 'Arab revolt' was a minor side-show of WWI. It only succeeded because of the efforts of the Allies. Jews also fought, in WWI, and WWII. Do you think the Turks have a right to claim it back?\n\n \n Really? THe seeds of the arab revolt were sown in 1908, with the end of the young turk coup. The revolt turned bloody in 1916. The british and french provided arms and technical advisors, as well as limited troops. THe Arabs fought their own battles. \n \n \nYou also forget that those 'Arabs' who revolted came from Arabia. They took a family from Arabia and made them kings of Jordan. They took another Arabian family and made them kings of Iraq. Did they consult the Jordanians or the Iraqis? No, because those nations did not exist.\n\n \n The jordanians chose their own king, once they were given a choice. Originally, the British divided jordan into 3 sections and ppointed a british governer for each one. This didn't work well, so they united the country under Emir Abdullah (late 1920). IT was like this until 1925, when h set up an elected governing body called the transjordan parliment. They declared Abdullah the king that same year (And yes, he was origninally from that region). Originally, the plan was to build one independent and unified Arab state stretching from Aleppo (Syria) to Aden (Yemen). In keeping with arab tradition, they saw no need to carve the regio up into little countries. For thousands of years, Arabs have understood that there were different ethnic groups in the ME, and they understood that differnt parts of the ME were homelands to these different groups (except for the beduin, who traveled thorughout the region). After the war was over, the British, French, and Russians decided they had better carve the region into sections that were more in the tradition of western coutnries, so they did. \n \n \n \nThe whole area's borders were drawn up by the allies. So, what makes someone a 'Palestinian' as opposed to a Syrian, goes back only to the last century... not '1,000s of years' as you said in a previous posting.\n \n Why also do you not protest against the fact that the Jordanians expelled the Palestinians from their territory?\n\n \n It is easy to tell a palestenian from a syrian. When I first learned to speak arabic, I learned the palestenian dialect. When I visited Sria, I could barely understand what people were saying. See above about how differnt they are. The lines that were drawn by the british, russians, and french following WWI were not drawn randomly. They were drawn along understood cultural boundries. They did this because, in the wisdom of our older generations who didn;t care so much for political correctness as they did for finding what works, they realised that it was much easier to rule a country if oyu only have one ethnic group to deal with. The difference between Syrians and Palestenians is like the differnce between a new yorker and a cajun. \n \n \nSo, you'd expect the Jews have a right to kill Germans.\n \n The Palestinians have a right to kill Jordanians.\n \n The Armenians have a right to kill Kurds and Turks\n \n The Kurds have a right to kill Turks.\n \n Palestinians and Jordanians have a right to kill Turks\n\n \n I didn't say they had the right, I said it is to be expected.\n \n \nWhat's this 'proportionately notion you now introduce? You are trying to say that the Israelis are worse than Hitler! That's a disgusting notion. \n \n \n Yes, it is a disgusting notion. It is even more disgusting that we support them in it. If you take the total number of people hitler had control over and the number of innocents that he slaughtered, then do the same for israel, israel makes hitler look like not such a big deal when you figure total percentage of population murdered. True, in final numbers they have not killed as many a hitler, but based on their policies and track record to date, I am sure that if we gave them control of the entire middle east (in which case they woudl STILL not have as many peopleunder their thumb as hitler did) they would rectify this immediatly.\n \n \nWho should own Gaza? Egypt could claim it.\n\n \n How do you figure? They never have before. The palestenians should control gaza. It is part of traditional palastine. Egyptians are not even Arabs.\n \n \nWhat do the Israeli's 'deserve'?\n \n It was only recently that the Palestinians took off their claim to all of the area... they had it as their political agenda that there should be NO state of Israel.\n\n \n In short, they deserve nothing. They got their state by using terrorist tactics, they don't \"deserve\" any of it. \n \n The palestenians have made a major concession by removing their claim to the entire area. \n \n \nHe used the methods of terrorism (as did some Israelis - including their current leader). All terrorists are terrorists.\n\n \n The question was not whether or not araft has used terrorist tactics, the question was whether or not he started the violence. I was simply showing that he could not have possibly started the violence, since it started before he was born.\n \n \nThe Arabs are losers, they've got a non-Arab nation right smack in the middle of them, and despite numerical strength haven't been able to do much about it. Even with oil as a weapon, and billions of petro-dollars, and a rabid hankering for the Koran, they've continued to fail. All they're good at is killing a few people trying to catch a bus to work.\n\n \n The Arabs have done pretty well considering the supprot that the US has given to israel. Who are the losers here? The arab states are self supporting. Israel is a worthless welfare state and always will be. \n \n \nOther Arab nations have kicked the Palestinians about - Jordan especially, because they hate each other.\n\n \n This from the same person who earlier contended that ther was no diffeernce between a Palestenian and a Syrian? At least get your uneducated propoganda right!\n \n \nThere's no Arab democracy anywhere.* In Iraq their killing off anyone associated with moves to a new government.\n\n \n There is no western style Arab democracy anywhere. Jordan, Egypt and Iran are democratic to a point. Even in Iran where they are pushing for governmental reform, they are not after western style democracy. The people in the ME have found over the centuries that ther are certain advantages to a monarchy. YOu only have to kill one guy if you are unhappy with it. They don't necesarily want a huge bureaucratic governmet with several different branches and a huge infrastructure consisting of hundreds of agencies to go with each branch. What those countries in the ME have devised in a strange (by western standards) type of almost democratic monarchy. We may not like it, but they seem to, and it seems to work for them. The countries in the ME that are decidely undemocratic are the ones that the US spends a lot of time and money making sure it stays that way. Saudi Arabia is a good example. We prefer to deal with a few fabulously wealthy sheiks that run everything as oppsed to having to worry about some kind of democratic government. The rulers of Saudi Arabis are concerned only with their own self interest. You get a government in there that is maybe concerned about what is best for the people as opposed to what is the best for one multi billionaire, and the rules change. \n \n \nIn Israel there are people protesting against their government... they're able to because it's a democracy. Where is the Arab opposition parties? In Palestinian circles they are assassinated by their own side if they speak out. (assassin is based on an Arab word)\n\n \n Wrong answer. THere are many palestenians who disagree with the PA and the Palestenian groups that are now in power. Many of them are prominent Palestenian business men. They recently met in Egypt to discuss an alternate peace plan with some prominent Israelis who are in opposition to their governments actions. \n \n You are right about assasin being based on an arab word (Actually, 2 arab words). Do you know what they are? I will give you a hint, the first one is hashish (like hash, the drug) and neither has anything to do with killing peple.\n \n \nYou go to Saudi Arabia - you can be arrested for carrying a crucifix.\n\n \n This is true. ANd in Israel, you can be killed for protesting. Funny how the two countrie in the ME that the US has the greatest presence/involvement in are also two of the most vrutal. MAkes you wonder about our priorities there.\n \n \nIn Israel you've got a sizeable part of the population who want all Israelis driven out. It is hard for a democracy to live in such an environment... at least they've got Arab incompetence to protect them\n\n \n Most of the Palestenians don't want all of the israelis driven out. They want theri land back. If the israelis gave the palestenians full right, there would definatly be some changes (since \"full rights\" means voting rights). Currently the militants can justify their actions against the israelis within the framework of Islam. If the israelis quit treating them so brutally, and actually treated them like people, quit stealing their land and made reperations for the land they have stolen in the past, they (the militant) would no longr be able to justify the attacks under the laws of Islam, which would effectively destroy the militant movement. The Quran specifically says the jews must be treated well since they worship the same god as the muslims, and that muslim hospitality must be extended to them. This worked for a LONG time just fine.\n \n IT is not Arab incompetance that protects the israelis, it is American military might. The Arabs had a recognisable culture, social structure, and government fort housands of years before london was even a village. The arab culture has survived intact longer than any other in history. You have to give them some credit just for this. By contrast, the jews have been kicked out of more countries than any other ethnic group I am aware of, and only have their own country now becasue they have found somebody with a big stick and a deep pocket to take care of them, since they cannot take care of themselves.\n \n This is not an issue of which race is \"better\", and I would prefer it not degrade to that point. If you really want to argue it, though, I suppose we could tally up Arab controbutions to the world, and jewish controbutions to the world. You might sit down and do this on your own before trying to argue it in public in order to keep yourself from looking foolish.",

   " So, you are defining 'Palestinian' as those people who inhabited the Roman part of Palestine, now under the control of Israel, and not that part who inhabited Palestine, now under the control of any other nation?\n\n \n What an absurd notion. Was Gaza part of Palestine? In fact, the Romans changed borders. For a while they had a client Jewish kingdom. Palmyra was left outside the empire for a while, then absorbed into it. You don't take this into account when defining 'Palestinian'... In fact, those Jews in Palestine are therefore 'Palestinian'... and they already own the land. \n \n \n No, I am definind (sic) \"Palestinian\" as a class of Arab who lived in traditional Palestine. I am using the traditional Palestine as that area fo (sic) the middle east which has traditionally been recognised by its inhabitants, as well as by others in the region, as Palestine. Palestenians (sic) have their own culture, their own dialect of Arabic, and their own traditions. Palestenians (sic) in other part of the middle east stick out like sore thumbs, they even look different than other Arabs. It is western ignorance that causes us to class them all together. If you go to Germany and ther (sic) is a British guy walking down the street, even if you don;t talk to him, you will most likely realise that there is something differnet (sic) about him.\n\n \n \"Palestine - originally denoted only the sea-coast of the land of Canaan inhabited by the Philistines (Ex. 15:14; Isa. 14:29, 31; Joel 3:4), and in this sense exclusively the Hebrew name Pelesheth (rendered \"Philistia\" in Ps. 60:8; 83:7; 87:4; 108:9) occurs in the Old Testament.\"\n (it included)\n 4) Peraea (a Greek name meaning the \"opposite country\"), the country lying east of the Jordan and the Dead Sea.\n http://www.biblelearn.com/east2828.htm\n \n Then the 'Palestinians' can claim parts of Jordan and the Lebanon, and small bits of Saudi Arabia. \n \"When Israel in the north ceased to exist in c 721BC, part of the area later became a territory known as Samaria. Most of Judah in the south, defeated in c 587BC, was later referred to as Judea. By the time of Jesus, PALESTINE comprised various territories. From north to south these were:\n 6. Perea included much of the present east bank of the Jordan.\"\n http://www.ccel.org/bible/phillips/CN600NTWORLD.htm#part4\n \n NOTE \"East\" Bank of the Jordan, that is, what's now part of Jordan - which you claimed was not part of Palestine. You just bandy about this notion of 'traditional' Palestine.\n \n In fact, the Palestinian Arab National Movement had their 1st Palestinian Arab Congress (1919) -- in southern Syria!\n http://www.stanford.edu/class/history187b/Outline13.htm\n \n You must also note that the whole area you regard as Palestine was only known as that, under the Romans. As I said, Palestine derived from Philistine, and they had only the coastal areas - the hinterland was Jewish. When the Romans arrived, the land had become an independent Jewish state again (having thrown off the Seleucids in Syria).\n \n \n People who fail to understand this lump the palestenians (sic) in with all the other Arabs and go \"it's the same thing\". It is not. When you see people who look radically differnt (sic) than you, and speak another language, and hold differnt (sic) customs, you do not always pick up on the little differnces (sic) that make all the difference in the world. Can you tell the differnce (sic) between a Korean and a Japanese guy by looking?\n\n \n Yes I can. And they speak a different language. Palestinians speak Arabic, so if I'm in doubt I need only hear one speak. Different 'dialects' can occur within the same people.\n \n \n They look radically different once you spend some time in Asia and get used to seeing them. Until people wake up and start to recognise that the differnce (sic) between the Palestenians (sic) and the Jordanians, or the palestenians (sic) and the Egyptians (who often get lumped in with the Arabs, though they are not Arabs, and do not consider themselves uch) (sic) they are not ever going to understand what is going on and they are going to continue running aournd (sic) and sying (sic) idiotic things about Jordan being a palestenian (sic) state, or about the palestenians (sic) going back to \"their\" country. Israel IS their country. If china invaded Canada and expelled all the Canadians to the US, would that be OK, since we are all white guys?\n\n \n As shown earlier, your notions of \"Palestine\" don't bear historical truth.\n \n \n By the way, the 'Arab revolt' was a minor side-show of WWI. It only succeeded because of the efforts of the Allies. Jews also fought, in WWI, and WWII. Do you think the Turks have a right to claim it back? \n\n \n \n Really? The seeds of the Arab revolt were sown in 1908, with the end of the young Turk coup. The revolt turned bloody in 1916. The British and French provided arms and technical advisors, as well as limited troops. The Arabs fought their own battles.\n\n \n Oh please! IF that's the case, then I can pre-date the 'Jewish Revolt' all the way back to 70 AD, should I wish a precedent.\n \n (by the way, do you know of the shameful massacre of Christians by the Muslims that happened in the late 1800s? - Should they seek compensation?)\n \n And the \"Arab\" revolt was centred on the Arabs of Arabia - the Hejaz region - not in Palestine! The allies awarded them the kingship in Jordan and Iraq.\n \n The Arabs would never have shaken off the Turks without the allies. The Turks only held the area for 900 years (minus times occupied by Crusaders, Mamelukes and Mongols) When was there ever an 'Arab-Palestinian' state?\n \n \n You also forget that those 'Arabs' who revolted came from Arabia. They took a family from Arabia and made them kings of Jordan. They took another Arabian family and made them kings of Iraq. Did they consult the Jordanians or the Iraqis? No, because those nations did not exist. \n\n \n \n The Jordanians chose their own king, once they were given a choice.\n\n \n They took an Arab, not a local lad - 'cause according to you they're a different group of peoples.\n \n \n Originally, the British divided Jordan into 3 sections and ppointed (sic) a British governer (sic) for each one. This didn't work well, so they united the country under Emir Abdullah (late 1920). IT was like this until 1925, when h (sic) set up an elected governing body called the transjordan parliment (sic). They declared Abdullah the king that same year (And yes, he was origninally (sic) from that region). Originally, the plan was to build one independent and unified Arab state stretching from Aleppo (Syria) to Aden (Yemen). In keeping with Arab tradition, they saw no need to carve the regio up into little countries. For thousands of years, Arabs have understood that there were different ethnic groups in the ME, and they understood that differnt (sic) parts of the ME were homelands to these different groups (except for the beduin(sic) , who travelled thorughout (sic) the region). After the war was over, the British, French, and Russians decided they had better carve the region into sections that were more in the tradition of western coutnries (sic), so they did. \n\n \n What part did Russia have in this? Here you state that the Brits declared Abdullah the king, but earlier you said that the Arabs had a choice. This is one of many 'facts' that you present, then contradict within this one posting.\n \n That the region was divided up by France and Britain, there is no doubt - that is in fact what's so silly about your notions of what's a Palestinian - it's only a modern construct - sure they use an old name, but the modern border, by which you believe they have claim to, are artificial. In Roman times, Palestine included parts of Syria and Jordan, so, logically, they too should be claiming bits of those nations too! They don't because they are simply trying to get rid of Israel.\n \n \n The whole area's borders were drawn up by the allies. So, what makes someone a 'Palestinian' as opposed to a Syrian, goes back only to the last century... not '1,000s of years' as you said in a previous posting.\n \n Why also do you not protest against the fact that the Jordanians expelled the Palestinians from their territory? \n\n \n \nIt is easy to tell a palestenian (sic) from a Syrian. When I first learned to speak Arabic, I learned the palestenian (sic) dialect. When I visited Sria, I could barely understand what people were saying. See above about how differnt they are. The lines that were drawn by the british, russians, and French following WWI were not drawn randomly. They were drawn along understood cultural boundries (sic) .\n\n \n Firstly, the Russians had no role to play in this - they were fighting a civil war into the 1920s and then were diplomatically isolated until their reproachmont with Germany. Secondly, look at the border between say, Syria and Iraq - it's mostly a dead straight line. It is just arbitrary. Same as in Kuwait, the Brits and French didn't want one state to control so much oil, so they created Kuwait.\n \n Also, later you deal with all 'Arabs' and their culture, but here, you want to say that they're different. Fine, contradict yourself, see if I care.\n \n I don't know why you could make this blatant error twice - go look at Russian history from the period. Sure, they tried getting involved pre-WWI, and after WWII. But not during the partition times as you believe.\n \n \nThey did this because, in the wisdom of our older generations who didn;t care so much for political correctness as they did for finding what works, they realised that it was much easier to rule a country if oyu (sic) only have one ethnic group to deal with. The difference between Syrians and Palestenians (sic) is like the differnce (sic) between a new yorker and a Cajun. \n\n \n What a silly example - they are both the same nationality! Your example of different nationalities are the same - American!\n \n \n So, you'd expect the Jews have a right to kill Germans.\n \n The Palestinians have a right to kill Jordanians.\n \n The Armenians have a right to kill Kurds and Turks\n \n The Kurds have a right to kill Turks.\n \n Palestinians and Jordanians have a right to kill Turks \n\n \n \nI didn't say they had the right, I said it is to be expected.\n\n \n Are you a Muslim? I would expect a Muslim to encourage peoples to kill.\n \n \n What's this 'proportionately notion you now introduce? You are trying to say that the Israelis are worse than Hitler! That's a disgusting notion. \n\n \n \nYes, it is a disgusting notion. It is even more disgusting that we support them in it. If you take the total number of people Hitler had control over and the number of innocents that he slaughtered, then do the same for israel (sic) , Israel makes Hitler look like not such a big deal when you figure total percentage of population murdered. True, in final numbers they have not killed as many a Hitler, but based on their policies and track record to date, I am sure that if we gave them control of the entire middle east (in which case they woudl (sic) STILL not have as many people under their thumb as Hitler did) they would rectify this immediatly (sic) .\n\n \n Do you actually want to put the figures forward?\n \n \n Who should own Gaza? Egypt could claim it. \n\n \n \nHow do you figure? They never have before. The palestenians (sic)* should control Gaza. It is part of traditional palastine.(sic) Egyptians are not even Arabs.\n\n \n *For goodness sake, at least spell them correctly.\n \n Where'd you get the notion that the Egyptians aren't Arabs?\n \n I just figured as they did control it prior to the 1967 war.\n \"The Gaza Strip is a narrow strip of land just northeast of the Sinai Peninsula. At the end of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War it was occupied by the Egyptians, under which it remained until it was claimed under international law by Israel during the Six-Day War of 1967. The Gaza Strip is unusual in being a densely settled area not recognized as a de jure part of any sovereign country.\"\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip\n \n Kind of undermines the term 'never have'. Another historical mistake. I should keep track.\n \n \nWhat do the Israeli's 'deserve'?\n\n \n It was only recently that the Palestinians took off their claim to all of the area... they had it as their political agenda that there should be NO state of Israel. \n \n \nIn short, they deserve nothing. They got their state by using terrorist tactics, they don't \"deserve\" any of it. \n\n \n Right. Now I see the anti-Semite coming out.\n \n \n The palestenians (sic) have made a major concession by removing their claim to the entire area. \n\n \n You mean that the Palestinians have realised that they're not going to get it, so they've removed their claim to it. But then this too undermines your support for the Palestinians - as they now say that they don't want it all, and you think that they should have it all. You are in disagreement with the Palestinians themselves on this.\n \n \n He used the methods of terrorism (as did some Israelis - including their current leader). All terrorists are terrorists. \n\n \n \nThe question was not whether or not araft (sic) has used terrorist tactics, the question was whether or not he started the violence. I was simply showing that he could not have possibly started the violence, since it started before he was born.\n\n \n If he continues on the terrorist tactics as begun by others, then your point is but a minor one.\n \n \n The Arabs are losers, they've got a non-Arab nation right smack in the middle of them, and despite numerical strength haven't been able to do much about it. Even with oil as a weapon, and billions of petro-dollars, and a rabid hankering for the Koran, they've continued to fail. All they're good at is killing a few people trying to catch a bus to work. \n\n \n \nThe Arabs have done pretty well considering the supprot (sic) that the US has given to Israel. Who are the losers here? The Arab states are self supporting. Israel is a worthless welfare state and always will be. \n\n \n Excuse me? Kuwait got rid of the Iraqis by themselves? Saudi Arabia didn't appeal for US help?\n \n Egypt never got arms from the Soviets? Neither did Syria? Egypt had to get a huge loan from the Soviets to build a dam.\n \n \nOther Arab nations have kicked the Palestinians about - Jordan especially, because they hate each other. \n\n \n \nThis from the same person who earlier contended that ther (sic) was no diffeernce (sic) between a Palestenian (sic) and a Syrian? At least get your uneducated propoganda (sic) right!\n\n \n Nice try. Jordan tried to be a modern state... but the Palestinians, those who consider themselves part of the never extant state, were nothing but trouble. It still speaks highly of Arab unity. Anyway, the notion that someone now is a Syrian, for example, is based solely on current boundaries as arbitrarily drawn up by Britain and France. That's what's so nonsensical about their ideas of Nationalism. It's like someone drawing a line between the US states, and ten years later you consider your former brothers, part of some foreign nation - and treat them accordingly.\n \n \nThere's no Arab democracy anywhere.* In Iraq their killing off anyone associated with moves to a new government. \n\n \n \nThere is no western style Arab democracy anywhere. Jordan, Egypt and Iran are democratic to a point. Even in Iran where they are pushing for governmental reform, they are not after western style democracy. The people in the ME have found over the centuries that ther (sic) are certain advantages to a monarchy. You only have to kill one guy if you are unhappy with it.\n\n \n There's not even 'Eastern' style democracies. But you hit upon the real nature of Arab politics with your last line. The bullet rules the ballot.\n \n \n They don't necesarily (sic) want a huge bureaucratic governmet (sic) with several different branches and a huge infrastructure consisting of hundreds of agencies to go with each branch. What those countries in the ME have devised in a strange (by western standards) type of almost democratic monarchy. We may not like it, but they seem to, and it seems to work for them. The countries in the ME that are decidely (sic) undemocratic are the ones that the US spends a lot of time and money making sure it stays that way. Saudi Arabia is a good example. We prefer to deal with a few fabulously wealthy sheiks that run everything as oppsed (sic) to having to worry about some kind of democratic government. The rulers of Saudi Arabis (sic) are concerned only with their own self interest. You get a government in there that is maybe concerned about what is best for the people as opposed to what is the best for one multi billionaire, and the rules change. \n\n \n I don't disagree that the Saudis are undemocratic... or that they are a US ally... you stated earlier that at least they were all self-supporting... now you disagree with that statement and say that they are supported by the US. Nice one! Thanks for that!\n \n But when you talk about 'they like the government they have' how do they express this approval?\n \n \n In Israel there are people protesting against their government... they're able to because it's a democracy. Where is the Arab opposition parties? In Palestinian circles they are assassinated by their own side if they speak out. (assassin is based on an Arab word) \n\n \n \nWrong answer. There are many palestenians (sic) who disagree with the PA and the Palestenian (sic) groups that are now in power. Many of them are prominent Palestenian (sic) business men. They recently met in Egypt to discuss an alternate peace plan with some prominent Israelis who are in opposition to their governments actions. \n\n \n Those that disagree have a short life-span. Hey, do you believe that the Druze have any rights? They are quite happy living under Israel.\n \n \nYou are right about assasin (sic) being based on an Arab word (Actually, 2 Arab words). Do you know what they are? I will give you a hint, the first one is hashish (like hash, the drug) and neither has anything to do with killing peple (sic) .\n\n \n Huh? It has something to do with killing people. There were a Muslim cult that practiced political murders - and got stoned. I am fully aware of this. It derives from hashish user.\n \n \n You go to Saudi Arabia - you can be arrested for carrying a crucifix. \n\n \n \nThis is true. And in Israel, you can be killed for protesting. Funny how the two countrie (sic) in the ME that the US has the greatest presence/involvement in are also two of the most vrutal (sic) . Makes you wonder about our priorities there.\n\n \n Indeed, makes you wonder about yours. Two cases, one presented by me, one by you. In Arabia - all such offenders are prosecuted. In Israel, people protest all the time - even Jews who don't agree with their state.\n \n But yes, again you recognise that there are Arab nations that need US support.\n \n \nIn Israel you've got a sizeable part of the population who want all Israelis driven out. It is hard for a democracy to live in such an environment... at least they've got Arab incompetence to protect them \n\n \n \nIT is not Arab incompetance (sic) that protects the Israelis, it is American military might. The Arabs had a recognisable culture, social structure, and government fort housands (sic) of years before London was even a village. \n\n \n So what's so special about London? Why is that the normative example? Having a city is not akin to having a culture anyway, but most of the 'Arab' high culture was stolen from the peoples they conquered, as the Assyrians can attest.\n \n Whilst the Arabs were still chasing sheep around the desert, Constantinople had street lighting and piped water.\n \n \nThe Arab culture has survived intact longer than any other in history. \n\n \n The Chinese would hotly dispute this! You've heard of them I suppose? So would the Japanese. Christian culture in the east (I am an Orthodox Christian) would have survived, except for attacks by Moslems.\n \n \nYou have to give them some credit just for this. By contrast, the Jews have been kicked out of more countries than any other ethnic group I am aware of, and only have their own country now becasue (sic) they have found somebody with a big stick and a deep pocket to take care of them, since they cannot take care of themselves.\n\n \n Wrong, they had their own country. And now they've got it back. Hang on, are we back to claiming that the Arabs can? That would make for yet another switch of stance on the same issue.\n \n \nThis is not an issue of which race is \"better\", and I would prefer it not degrade to that point. If you really want to argue it, though, I suppose we could tally up Arab controbutions (sic) to the world, and Jewish controbutions (sic) to the world. You might sit down and do this on your own before trying to argue it in public in order to keep yourself from looking foolish.\n\n \n The Arabs were good at printing copies of western books, such as those by Aristotle or Plato, and handing them back to 'us' to read. Or, from taking ideas from subject people and recognising that they were good... but look at them now. If they were so 'advanced' what happened?\n \n The Arabs lived in small hovels until they were able to take over the Roman provinces of the east. Then they got a taste of culture. Then they remembered the tenets of Islam regarding subject peoples, and anything not from the Koran as being worthless.\n \n Bernard Lewis has said that for the last 300 years the Arabs have been loosing in the war of cultures.\n He's not the only to note this...\n One of the reasons for Islamic decline ....\n 1) Limits to modernity. The nature of Islamic theology, ethics, culture and law limited the impact of foreign ideas and/or presented indigenous barriers to the emergence of the economic, political and cultural rationality, especially after the 16th century.\n http://www.angelfire.com/or3/tss2/islterror.html\n \n The Arabs have been good at terrorising peoples, I grant you that.\n Read http://www.answering-islam.org/Hahn/Mawdudi/index.htm to see if your notions of protest are really equitable.",

   "IF they controll it for another 50 generations, maybe. This isn;t going to happen, though. Israel is setting itself up for a major failure here. More andmore of the world is supporting the palestenians, and there is some grumbling in the American public. \n\n \n The US hasn't even controlled their land for 50 generations. Do we have rights to our land if we were invaded? Rights to land have always been decided by force and politics. I would debate that if the UN had said long ago that Israel has the right to the land they currently hold you would not be here debating that Israel doesn't have the right to it.\n \n \n \nWhen they set up the UN, certain countries insisted on being permanent SC members and having Veto power. This was a bad idea. Maybe it is time to change it. America has been the greatest supporter of this (keeping it the same). Ameica doesn't like the idea exactly because Israel would have been solved long ago if we didn;t have Veto power, and thus power to push around the SC. There have been multiple resolutions presented over the years tat would have resulted in a UN mandated takeover of Israel. WE have alays threated to veto it unless the threat of force was removed.\n \n \n The security council is just one of the faults of the UN. The UN is also a political organization now. That is not what they were intended to be. They are looking out for themselves as can be seen by the oil for food scandal. There are multiple reasons why the UN doesn't work not the least of which is this Israeli debate. The UN and US fighting over this is what has led to the Palestinians believing they are right and the Israelis beliving they are right. If the US and UN could have agreed on something long ago, regardless of which side they decided was right, then I don't think we would see nearly as much fighting in the area as we do now. This problem falls on the UN regardless as to whether or not the US is also at fault.\n \n \nSo your solution is to, what, just let Israel walk away without having to answer for their crimes? Accounts must be balanced if there is to be any hope of peace.\n \n \n Stop being so blind. Israel has to pay for their crimes with land but the Palestinians apparently don't have to pay for their crimes. What a wonderful policy. This is why negotiating with terrorists doesn't work. It makes no sense. You reward someone for bad behavior in hopes that they won't do it again.\n \n \nYour view on this is exactly contrary to reality. It was Israel who invaded that area. THey used terrorist tactics (sometimes against their own people to drum up international sympathy) in order to secure a homeland. After securing said homeland, they engaged in a policy of ethnic cleansing, which they continue to this day. \n\n \n And your saying the Palestinians had nothing to do with what is happening? They invaded Israel along with a lot of their pals. They did this multiple times and each time Israel won. They were on the side of the aggressor. As for the formation of the homeland that is something I probably can debate with you but neither of us can ever agree on the others point of view so it is pointless. You would contend the Israelis were terrorists for their actions in securing their homeland. I would contend that if they hadn't done what they did they would have been overrun by their enemies so they were doing what they had to do survive. The modern day Palestinians are not doing these things just to survive. They are doing it for hate, corruption, and greed. So I see a difference between the two and believe the Palestinians are doing much worse things than the Israelis did when they were securing their homeland. But again, this is an opinion you could never share and I could probably not change to match yours.\n \n \nIsrael isn't goig after civilians? Whose tanks and attack helicopters were firng on the protesters last week? WHose military killed over 40,000 unarmed noncoms when invading beirut? Wose military killed over 3000 women and children shortly thereafter in refuge camps? Israel has targeted civilians for years. They recently slowed it down a bit because they couldn't take the bad press, then point their fingers and scream injustice wen a few dozen israeli civilains are killed.\n\n \n The interesting thing here is that you admit the Israelis actually care about bad press. Do the Palestinians have this same care or are they more interested in winning than they are about their image? The Israelis avoid killing civilians in order to maintain the moral high ground while the Palestinians have no morals which in turn stacks the odds against Israel even more.\n \n \nYour logic here is warped. The Israeli Army is paid for 100% by US aid. Given a limited number of men, you can always defend a smaller area better than a bigger one. The economic lsses involved would not affect their ability to efend, becasue they are a welfare state, and the US will not let them fall ontheir butts, regardless of whether this is right or not.\n\n \n You only addressed one of the three reasons I brought up. The second reason being that the population they control will decrease. The larger the military to population the less qualified fighters you will have and the able people will be in the workforce. Of course this matters economically. The third reason being that their enemies now have a staging ground to coordinate their attacks from as well as a stronger economy and larger population. While the US wouldn't allow Israel to fall that is not the debate. The debate is whether or not they are actually accomplishing anything by pulling back in terms of defense and the answer is no. They weaken their position and strengthen their enemies position. How this principle is warped is beyond me.\n \n \nNot exactly. Not even close. I assume you are talking about in texas. What happened there was a popular uprising by the people in the region. After the revolution, texas formed its own country for a short time, then applied for statehood into the United States. There is a big difference between that and taking by force and against the will of the population at large a slice of a neiborghing country. \n\n \n I'm also talking about what happened through the rest of the military expansion of the US. Mexicans were forced out of their lands for the occupation of the US. I find it amazing to hear that you don't believe we took a large slice of a neighboring country against the will of the population of Mexico. We conquered far more than half of Mexico and unless their population supported this I'm not sure how your statement makes any sense.\n \n \nNo. Israel ever had a chance of taking and holding any more than they already have. We covered this in another thread. If you really want to get back into it, we can. Israel did manage to drive forces deep into those countries, then the US finally allowed passage of a UN resolution calling for a ceasfire. IT was not because Israel was kicking butt and taking names, it was because they had lost over 4000 men and over 5 billion dollars worht of equipment, including over a billion dollars worth that was emergency air lifted from the US. The ISraeli military was on the verge of collapse, and, the russians threatened to stop the US from providing resupply by force. This was another example of the US stepping up in the UN to cover ISraels butt. In another week, the Israeli military would have completley collapsed, and we would not be having these problems right now.\n\n \n This still doesn't resolve the matter that you don't believe in the UN resolution that gave Israel their land in the first place yet you do believe that Israel should follow the UN resolution that says they need to give some of their land back.\n \n As for the military expansion of Israel, they had multiple chances to do this. The held the Saini for a period of time and were not on the verge of collapse when losing this. Could they have rightfully kept this? If so then they would have had less land to conquer when the next war came around and they would have quickly struck a death blow to Egypt hitting Cairo and perhaps things could have been very different today in which we also wouldn't have to be having these problems right now.\n \n \nAnymore, it doesn't matter. Last time Israel asked him to stop the attacks, he got on TV and asked the terrorists to stop, ad they didn;t. BY taking small, measured steps against Arafat, the ISraelis have effectively rendered him impotent. He has become irrelevant, he no longer has the power to stop the violence. If they wanted to talk to somebody to stop the violence, the head of Hamas might be a good choice, as they would at least know the right people. They have assasinated the last two guys to head Hamas, though, effectively driving them underground. This is why we do not target generals during war time. If you kill all the generals, there is nobody left to sign the surrender papers. You effectively manage to make an official end to the war impossible, so you end up fighting forever.\n\n \n While this may be a fault of Israel it is still a problem for Palestine. So like I said earlier it is time for them to pick a new freedom fighter. One who will actually resolve this situation. If they cannot do this then what else can we say about them except that they only wish for war and not peace?\n \n \nIt is absolutly not based on opinion. The first attacks in the area in the zionist/arab conflict were made by Zionist terror groups in 1927, and it was long before hitler took power. The british didn't create israel because of what the Nazis did, they allowed for the creation of ISrael to stop the zionist terrorist attacks. The british didn;t even create israel. They saw that what the zionists wanted was unreasonable, and that the situation was unworkable, so they dropped the whole mess on other people. Crack a history book, you will learn a lot\n\n \n Do you even remember what quote I was responding to? Your quote didn't say the zionists started or didn't start the fighting. It specifically faulted Israel for it. That in itself is absolutely an opinion which now even yourself are stating as incorrect. You now state that zionist terrorist groups started the fighting, not Israel. So peek back at your previous statements once in a while.\n \n \nIsrael is small enough that their entire government could be taken out by a single tactical nuke. A good portion of their military could be taken out in the same manner, if the terrorists decided not to target the government. The myth of the undstoppable israeli military is an intersting one, but when you consider the tropp strengths of the surrounding countries, Israel is not equipped to invade them, only to defend itself. with 2 or 3 tactical nukes, you could effectively destroy the Israeli command and control structure. At that point, your military basically has the supplies they have on them at the moment, because withou command and control, there is no such thing as resupply. No military survives for long without a command structure.\n \n \n A tactical nuke takes out a few square blocks. Israel is far larger than this so if it is possible for a tactical nuke to accomplish what you claim it is not because of the size of Israel but rather because of the placement of their government buildings. Anyways I would doubt that they don't have some shadow goverment waiting in the wings for a situation such as this. This is also true of their military and lets not forget that Israel has the ability to respond with equal or greater nuclear measures regardless of what the terrorists do. Israel would conquer anyone they wanted in the region at this point even after such an attack simply because they have far more firepower.\n \n The Israeli military is not unstoppable but think about what you are saying here. \"tropp strengths of the surrounding countries\"???? The troop strength of the surrounding countries would have no choice but to fight the terrorists out of their nation. They would be fighting along side of Israel if tactical nukes were used against them partially because the UN wouldn't stand for such an attack. Israel would not face certain doom because of this attack not only because they probably have a good backup government and because the US would help them, but also because no one wants to be harboring terrorists at this stage of the game if it means they are risking themselves for the terrorists cause.\n \n \nIn order for that to happen, Israel is going to have to give in. When you talk arabs, you are talking peple who literally keep blood fueds alive for generations. There are some fairly well known family feuds in the arab world that have been going on for over a thousand years. People seem to think that if Israel could \"get a grip\" on the situation over there that we could solvew this thing. Not when you are dealing with people like the Arabs. The arabs are far too proud to give in, and will never forget what the israelis did. In west, whihc is built primarily on christian influence, we are taght \"forgive and forget\". In the middle east, it is \"forgive, but NEVER forget\". And they (as we) certainly don't forgive until reperations have been made.\n\n \n If they forgive but never forget then reperations don't mean anything. Also if many Arabs down there are of your mind set then they don't believe Israel has the right to exist at all so of course handing them over some land doesn't work. There are only two Arab nations that I can think of that are harboring terrorists who fight against Israel right now and those are Lebanon and Syria. Syria could be invaded by the US in the near future meaning they won't be a problem forever and Lebanon may just be captured by Israel after that if they remain the only threat to them. If this were to happen then it would set the stage for an actual respectable end. Israel could help rebuild Lebanon and Syria along side the US and install democracies there. The fix wouldn't happen over night but in time I believe this would lead to a peaceful end to this conflict with both sides ending up better than they are right now. This is how it was with Germany and Japan as well. Peace wasn't forged by paying them off. It was forged by defeating those who didn't want peace and then rebuilding a strong nation for those who did want peace. Sadly this is what I think has to happen in order to end this all. Violence to end the violence. As you said, the Arabs are too proud to let it end any other way.",

   "The US hasn't even controlled their land for 50 generations. Do we have rights to our land if we were invaded? Rights to land have always been decided by force and politics. I would debate that if the UN had said long ago that Israel has the right to the land they currently hold you would not be here debating that Israel doesn't have the right to it.\n\n \n You may be right. IF they had been on the land for years, it is quite possible that my attitude would be differnet. \n \n \nThe security council is just one of the faults of the UN. The UN is also a political organization now. That is not what they were intended to be. They are looking out for themselves as can be seen by the oil for food scandal. There are multiple reasons why the UN doesn't work not the least of which is this Israeli debate. The UN and US fighting over this is what has led to the Palestinians believing they are right and the Israelis beliving they are right. If the US and UN could have agreed on something long ago, regardless of which side they decided was right, then I don't think we would see nearly as much fighting in the area as we do now. This problem falls on the UN regardless as to whether or not the US is also at fault.\n\n \n THe US has effectively neutered the UN in the middle east. I am not sure what might have happened if the US and UN had come to some kind of agreements on the policy there. Alll I can say is that we know what has happened the way things are now, and it isn't good. I, ofr one, have a rel problem with the way the US has handled the situation with the UN. We joined the UN, and are free to leave at any time. While we are in the UN, we are bound to live by the rules of the UN. That is part of the deal. It is dishonorable of us to fail to do so. MAybe my sense when it comes to things like honor and integrity are outdated, but I always thought that sticking to the deals you make and doing what you have promised to do were part of it.\n \n \nStop being so blind. Israel has to pay for their crimes with land but the Palestinians apparently don't have to pay for their crimes. What a wonderful policy. This is why negotiating with terrorists doesn't work. It makes no sense. You reward someone for bad behavior in hopes that they won't do it again.\n\n \n What crimes have the palestenians commited? It is not only the right, but the responsibility of people all over the world to resist a tyranical occupying force. This is not a crime. It may be distasteful, but it is not a crime. It was not a crime when we carpet bombed german cities during WWII. \n \n \nThe interesting thing here is that you admit the Israelis actually care about bad press. Do the Palestinians have this same care or are they more interested in winning than they are about their image? The Israelis avoid killing civilians in order to maintain the moral high ground while the Palestinians have no morals which in turn stacks the odds against Israel even more.\n\n \n The palestenians certainly seem to care about bad press. They also seem to understand that, as freedom fighters who are vastly outmanned and outgunned, a little latitude will be given to them in regards to their tactics. THey seem to be right. They blow up a bus with 25 people on it, and people go \"that is too bad\". Israel launches missiles from a helicopter at protsters, and there is international outrage. \n \n \nYou only addressed one of the three reasons I brought up. The second reason being that the population they control will decrease. The larger the military to population the less qualified fighters you will have and the able people will be in the workforce. Of course this matters economically. The third reason being that their enemies now have a staging ground to coordinate their attacks from as well as a stronger economy and larger population. While the US wouldn't allow Israel to fall that is not the debate. The debate is whether or not they are actually accomplishing anything by pulling back in terms of defense and the answer is no. They weaken their position and strengthen their enemies position. How this principle is warped is beyond me.\n\n \n Since the population of the Gaza strip and the WEst bank are over 90% Palestenian. They are not drawing troops from this portion of the population, so it is not going to impact their ability to muster a military or effect the quality of their soldiers. As far as giving the enemy a staging ground, the enemy already apparently has a staging ground. There is no down side to segregating the enemy from the rest of your population.\n \n THey would definatly loose some financially, since the occupied territories are the riches parts if ISrael in terms of agricultural value. I have trouble mustering much sympathy in this, you are not allowed to invade your neiborghs for farm land.\n \n \nI'm also talking about what happened through the rest of the military expansion of the US. Mexicans were forced out of their lands for the occupation of the US. I find it amazing to hear that you don't believe we took a large slice of a neighboring country against the will of the population of Mexico. We conquered far more than half of Mexico and unless their population supported this I'm not sure how your statement makes any sense.\n\n \n Sorry, I was unaware that we were looking at the larger issue in regards to the US/mexico situation. We bought flordia and large portions of that area from spain under the adam-onis treaty. In California, the Mexicans were basically bred out. By 1845 the populations was predominatly non mexican or mixed. THe mexicans could not control the colony, and on june 10th of that year, a group on sonoma took up arms against the mexican government, crafted their own flag and declared an independant republic. THis coincided with the start of a war between Mexico and America. \n \n At the beginning of the war, there was an estimated 150,000 people living in the Alta california territory, and only about 14,000 of them were european or mexican. This is what cost the MExicans california and the southwest. THough the AMericans sent troops to back the people, it was effectively lack of mexicans in the territory that cost mexico california and the southwest. Had there been more of them there, it might have been a different story.\n \n Whats the difference, and how does this relate to the ISraeli-Palestenian conflict? THe days of butcher for land are supposed to be over. Israel has agreed to live by the rules set by the UN, and should be expected to do so.\n \n \nThis still doesn't resolve the matter that you don't believe in the UN resolution that gave Israel their land in the first place yet you do believe that Israel should follow the UN resolution that says they need to give some of their land back.\n\n \n Sorry, I thought this was a rhetorical question. I don't believe in the resolution that created israel because I don;t believe the UN had the authority to do so. I beleve in the right of self determinaiton. THe people as a whole in that regions hould have had the right to pick their own government.\n \n As far as why israel should be bound by the later UN declerations....because they agreed to be. THis is part of being a UN nation. There are some pretty hefty benifits to being a UN country, but there i a price that goes with this. THere are rules that you have to agree to follow.\n \n \nAs for the military expansion of Israel, they had multiple chances to do this. The held the Saini for a period of time and were not on the verge of collapse when losing this. Could they have rightfully kept this? If so then they would have had less land to conquer when the next war came around and they would have quickly struck a death blow to Egypt hitting Cairo and perhaps things could have been very different today in which we also wouldn't have to be having these problems right now.\n\n \n Attacking egypt would do nthing for their cause, since Egyptians are not arabs and are certainly not palestenians. Again, Israel pulled out of sainai because they couldn't hold it. THey were unable to resupply their troops there or deal with the border situation. It took over half of the Israli military to hold saini, and the were having trouble supplying their troops. They were not on the verge of collapse when they were in Saini, but only becasue they had sense enough to withdraw before this happened (escalations in violence in other parts of the countyr also had a lot to do with the decision). THe food ration ofr Israeli solders in Saini was less tha 1000 calories per day, and they were only getting about a litre of water per day. THey rolled into Saini expected big support from the US in the form of airlifts and military aid. When that support was obviosly not forthcoming, they made the only logical decision they could and pulled back out.\n \n \nWhile this may be a fault of Israel it is still a problem for Palestine. So like I said earlier it is time for them to pick a new freedom fighter. One who will actually resolve this situation. If they cannot do this then what else can we say about them except that they only wish for war and not peace?\n\n \n So you want them to pick a freedom fighter who effectively will not fight for freedom?\n \n \nDo you even remember what quote I was responding to? Your quote didn't say the zionists started or didn't start the fighting. It specifically faulted Israel for it. That in itself is absolutely an opinion which now even yourself are stating as incorrect. You now state that zionist terrorist groups started the fighting, not Israel. So peek back at your previous statements once in a while.\n\n \n Sorry, I will correct myself (if you wish to nitpick). Zionist terrorist groups started the violence in the region. They heads of these terrorist groups, to a man, became the new rulers of israel upon its creation. \n \n \n \nA tactical nuke takes out a few square blocks. Israel is far larger than this so if it is possible for a tactical nuke to accomplish what you claim it is not because of the size of Israel but rather because of the placement of their government buildings. Anyways I would doubt that they don't have some shadow goverment waiting in the wings for a situation such as this. This is also true of their military and lets not forget that Israel has the ability to respond with equal or greater nuclear measures regardless of what the terrorists do. Israel would conquer anyone they wanted in the region at this point even after such an attack simply because they have far more firepower.\n\n \n They really only need to take 2 government buildings, the parliment building (while in session) and the military building. Thesear eonly a few hundred yards apart, and share the same cafeteria. No problem there.\n \n IT is pssible they would have some kind of shadow government for such an eventuality. It is doubtful whether or not hey could actually manage to regain control. Shadow governments tend to be unreliable. \n \n They do have the ability to respond with a nuke, but I doubt that they would do so simply for the fact nobody would be willing to take the responsibility lacking orders from the government. That is taking a HUGE responsibility on yourself. \n \n \nThe Israeli military is not unstoppable but think about what you are saying here. \"tropp strengths of the surrounding countries\"???? The troop strength of the surrounding countries would have no choice but to fight the terrorists out of their nation. They would be fighting along side of Israel if tactical nukes were used against them partially because the UN wouldn't stand for such an attack. Israel would not face certain doom because of this attack not only because they probably have a good backup government and because the US would help them, but also because no one wants to be harboring terrorists at this stage of the game if it means they are risking themselves for the terrorists cause.\n\n \n First, you are putting a lt of faith in a shadow government whose existance is purely theoretical. Second, while the UN would not tolerate such an attack, they would also not be willing to stand by and watch israel butcher civilians who were not responsible. IF the detonation of a tctical nuke in israel did not directly lead to the end of israel as a state, israels response to it certainly would. The israeli government is not known for its restraint.\n \n \nIf they forgive but never forget then reperations don't mean anything. Also if many Arabs down there are of your mind set then they don't believe Israel has the right to exist at all so of course handing them over some land doesn't work. There are only two Arab nations that I can think of that are harboring terrorists who fight against Israel right now and those are Lebanon and Syria.

Violence to end the violence. As you said, the Arabs are too proud to let it end any other way.\n\n \n Your idealism in this area shows a complete detachment from reality. Egypt and JOrdan ar both harboring palestenian figters. We are trying the \"Invade and then set up a democracy\" thing in Iraq right now. IT is not going well. THe US may very well try to invade syria, but I kind of doubt it since it seems that IRaq and Afghanistan are more than we can actually handle. Israel invading Lebanon would give them MUCH more than they could handle.\n \n THe ARabs have already made huge concessions to israel. It is time to see the israelis make some as well. Every arab nation has promised israel normal relations if they wil withdraw from the occupied terrirtories, yet israel refuses to do so. It is difficult to decide whis is more astounding in this situation,. the arrogance of the israelis or the stupidity of the Americans. Israel NEEDS that region to be in chaos as an excuse for their failures. IF they had normalised relation with the rest of the region, there is a very good chance the the US would pull our billions in welfare that we currently hand out to israel. Then it woudl be tiem to sink or swim on thier own. The state of israel is a poorly concieved on, and poorly organised. They cannot swim.",

This is not a crime. It may be distasteful, but it is not a crime. It was not a crime when we carpet bombed German cities during WWII.\n\n \n To answer this question, it really depends on 'who are the Palestinian's? And according to you, it's those Arabs who live in what the Romans called Palestine ('historical Palestine') but not those bits now currently occupied by the Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\n \n Even with your silly contorting of time and space, we can still look at this... given that some were quite happy servants of the former Turks, especially when it came to conducting genocide.\n \n \n \n \"Situation in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority\n \n After World War II, Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus, was 80% Christian and Nazareth 60%. Now those percentages are 20% and 30% respectively, and are shrinking. Jerusalem Christians were a plurality in the 1920s; today, they number under 2 percent of the city's population.\n \n Serious violations of religious freedom are reported from within the Palestinian Authority, especially the persecution of Muslims who have converted to Christianity. In the Christian town of Bet Jella, a human rights lawyer reported brutal interrogation methods and arbitrary arrests based on fabricated criminal charges against Muslims who have converted to Christianity and their families. His report includes testimony about torture from victims who were terrified to criticize the Palestinian Authority and their secret police.\n \n In Nazareth, the Christian population has decreased dramatically due to the rise and spread of militant Islam. The Islamic Movement (a radical Muslim group) has demanded the construction of a mosque near the Church of the Annunciation, a mosque even some moderate Muslims oppose. On Easter, 1999, the Muslim group burned Christian stores and targeted Christians over the issue; attempts to intervene were frustrated because Christians are terrified to speak out.\n \n Hundreds of Christian families have left Palestinian towns like Bet Jella and Bethlehem during the al-Aqsa intifada, caught literally in the crossfire between Palestinians and Israelis. On the West Bank, a nearly-permanent Muslim boycott of Christian businesses is achieving its objective: driving the Christians to emigrate. \n \n In October 2000, Christians were attacked in Gaza after a Palestinian Muslim leader called for a \"jihad\" against both Jews and Christians.\n \n In February 2002 a Muslim mob, including Palestinian Authority Special Forces, burned Christian businesses and attempted to destroy the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches in Ramallah.

Arabic was injected through all strata of the conquered population which did not have much choice in the matter.

I must state here that as an Orthodox Christian, I am aware of Israelii pressure upon all 'Palestinians' including Christians, and further, I am against killing, however I recognise that Israel must survive, and that Islam is intrinsically a belligerent theology - and they can't stand the fact that a non-Muslim state is placed amongst them... they barely tolerate the Christians in the Lebanon, but that's because they are only 48% of their nation.",

   "You may be right. IF they had been on the land for years, it is quite possible that my attitude would be differnet.\n\n \n They have been on that land for years and yet your attitude is this way.\n \n \nTHe US has effectively neutered the UN in the middle east. I am not sure what might have happened if the US and UN had come to some kind of agreements on the policy there. Alll I can say is that we know what has happened the way things are now, and it isn't good. I, ofr one, have a rel problem with the way the US has handled the situation with the UN. We joined the UN, and are free to leave at any time. While we are in the UN, we are bound to live by the rules of the UN. That is part of the deal. It is dishonorable of us to fail to do so. MAybe my sense when it comes to things like honor and integrity are outdated, but I always thought that sticking to the deals you make and doing what you have promised to do were part of it.\n\n \n First of all why do you make the assumption that the UN is right and the US is wrong? Popular opinion in the corrupted UN is against us but perhaps the corruption is the cause of that. Secondly the US shouldn't leave the UN if it is doing what is right while the UN threatens to do what is wrong. Perhaps the US has to act as a balance to that sort of thing in the UN. Thirdly, I wouldn't bring honor or integrity into any debate concerning the UN. They have none. They are mostly about politics and doing what benefits themselves.\n \n \nWhat crimes have the palestenians commited? It is not only the right, but the responsibility of people all over the world to resist a tyranical occupying force. This is not a crime. It may be distasteful, but it is not a crime. It was not a crime when we carpet bombed german cities during WWII.\n\n \n When we carpet bombed Germany it was because they were the aggressors. Israel has not been the aggressor. They were formed, attacked, then attacked again, and then again and again. They were victorious and today they are again under attack. They have not just suddenly invaded other countries without cause like the Germans did. So if today the US were to unjustly carpet bomb Germany that would be similar to what the Palestinians are doing bombing these buses. Also as Montalban has clearly shown, Palestinians are fighting in the wrong spot entirely if they want their land back. So actually this would be similar to the US carpet bombing France in order to reclaim land from Germany. Talk about a crime and talk about stupidity to boot.\n \n \nThe palestenians certainly seem to care about bad press. They also seem to understand that, as freedom fighters who are vastly outmanned and outgunned, a little latitude will be given to them in regards to their tactics. THey seem to be right. They blow up a bus with 25 people on it, and people go \"that is too bad\". Israel launches missiles from a helicopter at protsters, and there is international outrage.\n\n \n Maybe your type will look at 25 dead due to a terrorist attack and say \"that is too bad\" but in general the Palestinian movement has little support due to their tactics. This is not to say that Israel has a lot more support but people do not just look at the terrorist attacks on Israel and say oh well thats life especially now that terrorism has hit the US. The message is embedded into many people that you cannot give terrorists what they want or they will just want more.\n \n \nSince the population of the Gaza strip and the WEst bank are over 90% Palestenian. They are not drawing troops from this portion of the population, so it is not going to impact their ability to muster a military or effect the quality of their soldiers. As far as giving the enemy a staging ground, the enemy already apparently has a staging ground. There is no down side to segregating the enemy from the rest of your population.\n\n \n You are again not thinking about this from both sides. While I'm sure you are wrong in that the Gaza strip and West bank provide no troops to Israel you also don't consider that if they provide massive support for Palestinians then it would be very detrimental for Israel to give up this land. Also what staging ground are you talking about and what over segregating the enemy? You mean like Afghanistan was a staging ground for attacks on the US therefore letting the terrorists have land in Florida as well in order to separate their forces wouldn't have a negative impact on the US's chances of stopping terrorism?\n \n \nTHey would definatly loose some financially, since the occupied territories are the riches parts if ISrael in terms of agricultural value. I have trouble mustering much sympathy in this, you are not allowed to invade your neiborghs for farm land.\n\n \n If you are not allowed to invade your neighbors then how can you explain the number of times Israel has been invaded? If you really believe in what you just said then you must feel pretty strongly against the fact that Israel has been invaded several times in the past and must feel equally as strong that the invaders be punished for their past crimes.\n \n \nWhats the difference, and how does this relate to the ISraeli-Palestenian conflict? THe days of butcher for land are supposed to be over. Israel has agreed to live by the rules set by the UN, and should be expected to do so.\n\n \n If the days of butcher for land are over then what are the Palestinians doing exactly? Lets see here, butcher, and they are doing it for, ummm, land? If you want to bring the UN rules into this then the Palestinians are breaking just about all of them in their terrorist style attacks on Israel so don't go basing your argument on this as it isn't going to work.\n \n [QUOTE]Sorry, I thought this was a rhetorical question. I don't believe in the resolution that created israel because I don;t believe the UN had the authority to do so. I beleve in the right of self determinaiton. THe people as a whole in that regions hould have had the right to pick their own government.[QUOTE]\n \n This again shows that you cannot use the UN to back your arguments as you do not even believe in the UN's purpose.\n \n \nAs far as why israel should be bound by the later UN declerations....because they agreed to be. THis is part of being a UN nation. There are some pretty hefty benifits to being a UN country, but there i a price that goes with this. THere are rules that you have to agree to follow.\n\n \n One thing about being a country is that you also have the God given right to protect yourself. Israel has not survived this long by being stupid. They know that people like you are out there who would love to seem them driven into the sea. They are not going to give up land to their enemies because the corrupt and uncaring UN says to do so. The UN doesn't care for what happens to Israel so why should Israel care what the UN says? Basically what I'm saying is that Israel controls their own fate, not the UN. The UN is not made to be the all mighty ruler of every country who is involved in the organization. That is why the US was able to go to war with Iraq to protect itself from a future aggressor. That is why China may one day be able to go to war with Taiwan to take what they believe is their own.\n \n \nAttacking egypt would do nthing for their cause, since Egyptians are not arabs and are certainly not palestenians. Again, Israel pulled out of sainai because they couldn't hold it. THey were unable to resupply their troops there or deal with the border situation. It took over half of the Israli military to hold saini, and the were having trouble supplying their troops. They were not on the verge of collapse when they were in Saini, but only becasue they had sense enough to withdraw before this happened (escalations in violence in other parts of the countyr also had a lot to do with the decision). THe food ration ofr Israeli solders in Saini was less tha 1000 calories per day, and they were only getting about a litre of water per day. THey rolled into Saini expected big support from the US in the form of airlifts and military aid. When that support was obviosly not forthcoming, they made the only logical decision they could and pulled back out.\n\n \n Attacking Egypt would do nothing? Don't you recall Egypt invading them after they gave back the Sinai? Had Israel taken Cairo and held it think of the power they would have been by the next time they were invaded. They would today probably be in control of the whole of Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon. The only reason this isn't the case is that they went along with what the UN wanted them to do. They gave back much of the land they took. The result? Surprise, surprise, they got invaded again and again. So open your eyes and see the past. Giving up land to their enemies in compliance with UN wishes has never benefited Israel. Don't expect that it will do so in the future either.\n \n \nSo you want them to pick a freedom fighter who effectively will not fight for freedom?\n\n \n I want them to pick a freedom fighter who is in search of peace, not one who has been a killer and a thug his whole life and shows no intention of looking for peace.\n \n \nThey really only need to take 2 government buildings, the parliment building (while in session) and the military building. Thesear eonly a few hundred yards apart, and share the same cafeteria. No problem there.\n\n \n So would you support this style of attack? If so, would you also be in support of Israel's right to defend itself by attempting to capture Syria or Lebanon or both in response due to the fact that Israel was the one that was attacked? I'm guessing that ideally you would support Israel being attacked and then handcuffing them from being able to retaliate as has been done in the past but that is again just a guess.\n \n \nIT is pssible they would have some kind of shadow government for such an eventuality. It is doubtful whether or not hey could actually manage to regain control. Shadow governments tend to be unreliable. \n\n \n Israel has a professional army and probably a lot of nuclear weapons. Shadow government or not, they would be able to launch retaliations that would be unmatched throughout history if they wished to do so following such an invasion.\n \n \nThey do have the ability to respond with a nuke, but I doubt that they would do so simply for the fact nobody would be willing to take the responsibility lacking orders from the government. That is taking a HUGE responsibility on yourself.\n\n \n \n Lets put this in the US's situation. OK Washington is gone, nuked by Russia. NORAD is gone, out chain of command has broken down, and our shadow government steps in. You are the person with your finger on the \"button\" just waiting for orders knowing that your capital has just been nuked and your countrymen are dead. Are you saying that you would have launched nukes for the original president even without cause but you would not launch them for a shadow president even with cause? Again, Israel has a professional military. They are not some back ally operation and they would no doubt be able to swiftly respond to any threat such as the one you laid out.\n \n \nFirst, you are putting a lt of faith in a shadow government whose existance is purely theoretical. Second, while the UN would not tolerate such an attack, they would also not be willing to stand by and watch israel butcher civilians who were not responsible. IF the detonation of a tctical nuke in israel did not directly lead to the end of israel as a state, israels response to it certainly would. The israeli government is not known for its restraint.\n\n \n Having a backup government is just about as theoretical as Israel having nuclear weapons. They are the targets of about every country on the planet and they know it. As for what the UN would do, why do you think a retaliation from Israel would end their state? If they were attacked by a tactical nuke by either a terrorist nation or a country then they would have the full support of the US right off the bat. The US and the UN would quickly attempt to find a solution would inevitably result in an unprecedented attack on the aggressor. Israel has shown restraint recently when asked to do so by the US as seen in the first Gulf War. I think Israel would be willing to get aid from the rest of the world while they prepare for an invasion of their enemy.\n \n \nYour idealism in this area shows a complete detachment from reality. Egypt and JOrdan ar both harboring palestenian figters. We are trying the \"Invade and then set up a democracy\" thing in Iraq right now. IT is not going well. THe US may very well try to invade syria, but I kind of doubt it since it seems that IRaq and Afghanistan are more than we can actually handle. Israel invading Lebanon would give them MUCH more than they could handle.\n\n \n Jordan and Egypt are both not fond of supporting the Palestinian cause and I'm sure you are aware of that. The Iraqi democracy is not working right now because we had no plan of how to get it to work. It is safe to say that we will devise much better plans in the future before acting. As for Lebanon giving Israel more than they can handle, Lebanon, Israel has twice the population, ten times the economic strength, has far superior weapons, and spends sixteen times as much on military as Lebanon. Lebanon would also quickly look to Syria for help in the case of war with Israel and with Syria out of the picture who would help them? The population of Lebanon would not be fiercely against the Israelis either. Also Israel has taken much larger portions of land in the past than Lebanon and they have managed to do with within days. I'm not sure where Lebanon would be much more than Israel could handle.\n \n \nTHe ARabs have already made huge concessions to israel. It is time to see the israelis make some as well. Every arab nation has promised israel normal relations if they wil withdraw from the occupied terrirtories, yet israel refuses to do so. It is difficult to decide whis is more astounding in this situation,. the arrogance of the israelis or the stupidity of the Americans. Israel NEEDS that region to be in chaos as an excuse for their failures. IF they had normalised relation with the rest of the region, there is a very good chance the the US would pull our billions in welfare that we currently hand out to israel. Then it woudl be tiem to sink or swim on thier own. The state of israel is a poorly concieved on, and poorly organised. They cannot swim.\n\n \n The Arabs have conceded nothing. They lost their land originally against their will. They lost more land in the future because of attacks they launched. What exactly have they conceded? And what of every nation promising normal relations with Israel? The nations surrounding Israel are not a threat to Israel any longer. It is the terrorists who are and they will not quit fighting just because Israel gives up some land.\n \n The stupidity falls on all sides. Pride, hate, and ignorance all around. Normalised relations do nothing to stop terrorism. That is the real reason Israel would fall without US help. Their enemies would remain and would never quit. You either fail to understand this or simply don't care. For Israel to survive they have to stamp out terrorism.\n \n How would you like this solution. The Arab nations unite in killing all terrorists who threaten Israel. In return if the terrorist attacks end for one year then Israel will slowly start giving land back to the Arab nations. If you don't agree with this solution because you don't believe it is possible for the Arab nations to stop the terrorist attacks by themselves the in essence you agree with me in that pleasing the nations around Israel does nothing to protect them from their real enemies. So just admit it. The real problem here isn't the US, it isn't the UN, it isn't Israel or Syria or the Arab nations, it is the terrorist tactics of the Palestinian \"freedom fighters\". They make it impossible for Israel to present a concession to the Arabs and make it impossible for the Arab nations to bring an end to this hateful and bloody war. Neither the Arab nations or Israel has any control over when this war ends.",

   "To answer this question, it really depends on 'who are the Palestinian's? And according to you, it's those Arabs who live in what the Romans called Palestine ('historical Palestine') but not those bits now currently occupied by the Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\n\n \n No, it is not simply the Arabs who live in what the Romans called palestine. You are still trying to define \"palestenian\" by looking at a map. IT is not going to work. You can't define a Kurd by looking at a map, either. I am defining \"Palestenian\" as those Arabs who have their own language, customs and traditions that are different than those of any other Arabs in the region. How do you define a Tibetan? Even if a Tibetan leaves Tibet, they are still a Tibetan. Wherever a Palestenian goes in the arab world, they are obiosly a palestenian. They talk different, they act different, and they LOOK different. You can pick them out of a crowd. Perhapse they are decendants from the Philistenes who invaded the area. I reall don't know. I do know that they look different. IT is lika standing a chines guy next to a vietnamese guy. You can definatly tell they are different.\n \n \nEven with your silly contorting of time and space, we can still look at this... given that some were quite happy servants of the former Turks, especially when it came to conducting genocide.\n\n \n It is not I who have contorted history. I am not surprised you have, though. I have found that racist often twist history to suit their vision of reality (admin, this is not \"name calling\" we can look back through this particualr individuals earlier posts and see quite clearly that he is a good old fashioned racist).\n \n This will be my last word to you in particular on this subject, as I have found that racists are seldom bright enough to be worth debating. They spew their twisted rhetoric without any objectivity and twist logic and fact to fit their totalitarin world views. To tolerate racism is to toerate absolute ignorance.\n \n \nYou hit the nail on the head. The trouble with Israel ISN'T because they are displacing Palestinians, it's that they're Jews. The rest of the Arab world could care less about Palestinians getting a homeland, especially if it meant giving up some of their land. It's ALL about anti-sematism. They don't want Jews amongst them and would cut off their noses to spite their face to rid themselves of them.\n\n \n But this hasn't proven to be the case. The muslim religion doesn't allow for the persecution of Jews for racial reasons. It is specifically prohibited because the Jews and the Muslims worship the same god. The muslims and Jews lived peacefully for a VERY long time.\n \n \nFirst of all why do you make the assumption that the UN is right and the US is wrong? Popular opinion in the corrupted UN is against us but perhaps the corruption is the cause of that. Secondly the US shouldn't leave the UN if it is doing what is right while the UN threatens to do what is wrong. Perhaps the US has to act as a balance to that sort of thing in the UN. Thirdly, I wouldn't bring honor or integrity into any debate concerning the UN. They have none. They are mostly about politics and doing what benefits themselves.\n\n \n I don't assume the UN is right and the US is wrong. THis particular situation is such a mess that the line between who si right and who is wrong is non-existant. I bring the UN into this simply for the fact that as UN nations, bth Israel and the US have agreed to abide by the rules of the UN. IF we no longer wish to do so, we have only to leave the UN. Barring that, we are bound to follow the rules as set forth by that body. It is a question of integrity. I realise that I am just a poor dumb hick from kansas, but I was under the impression that when you made a deal, you stuck to it. \n \n I will admit that my views on this may be a little old fashioned. I routinely do business on a hand shake, and consider the deals sealed in such a manner every bit as binding as agreements sealed with a hundred page contract. Way back at the creatin of the UN, we took a look and decided that ws somethign we wanted to be part of. There are benifits to being a UN nation, and the only real drawback is that you mut agree to abide by the rules the UN has set forth. We agreed to this. NOw it is time to pony up and follow thse rules. Membership in the UN is strictly voluntary, if we don't want to live by their rules, we can always unvolunteer.\n \n \nWhen we carpet bombed Germany it was because they were the aggressors. Israel has not been the aggressor. They were formed, attacked, then attacked again, and then again and again. They were victorious and today they are again under attack. They have not just suddenly invaded other countries without cause like the Germans did. So if today the US were to unjustly carpet bomb Germany that would be similar to what the Palestinians are doing bombing these buses. Also as Montalban has clearly shown, Palestinians are fighting in the wrong spot entirely if they want their land back. So actually this would be similar to the US carpet bombing France in order to reclaim land from Germany. Talk about a crime and talk about stupidity to boot.\n\n \n Israel is not an agressor? Are you kidding? They used terrorist tactics and back room dealing to obtain their nation. The first thing they did was embark on a policy of ethnic cleansing. To me, this is agression. Montelban has shown an absolute ignorance of the middle east and the ARab people, no more. \n \n \nMaybe your type will look at 25 dead due to a terrorist attack and say \"that is too bad\" but in general the Palestinian movement has little support due to their tactics. This is not to say that Israel has a lot more support but people do not just look at the terrorist attacks on Israel and say oh well thats life especially now that terrorism has hit the US. The message is embedded into many people that you cannot give terrorists what they want or they will just want more.\n\n \n It seems that world opinion has turned drastically against Israel. I think it is fair to say that the ONLY thing standing between Israel and complete destruction is the US. \n \n \nYou are again not thinking about this from both sides. While I'm sure you are wrong in that the Gaza strip and West bank provide no troops to Israel you also don't consider that if they provide massive support for Palestinians then it would be very detrimental for Israel to give up this land. Also what staging ground are you talking about and what over segregating the enemy? You mean like Afghanistan was a staging ground for attacks on the US therefore letting the terrorists have land in Florida as well in order to separate their forces wouldn't have a negative impact on the US's chances of stopping terrorism?\n\n \n Fewer than 10% of the jewish population of Israel lives in these areas. How many troops could they possibly be drawing from these areas?\n \n AS far as segregating themselves from their enemies, what I am saying is that these areas they have occupied are full of enemies of Israel. RIght now, they are, for all intents and purposes, operating inside Israel. IF ISrael were to actually withdraw from the occupied territories, they woudl be able to secure their border. AS things stand right now, it will never be possible for them to do so, short of killing every palestenian in the ocuntry (And I don't doubt for even one second that they would not do this if they thought they could get away with it). \n \n What Israel has done is more akin to if the US declared Iraq a 51st state. This would open the door to all kinds of attacks on the US. We sould effectively be importing terrorists. THis is what Israel has done. They have effectively brought the terrorists to their country.\n \n \nIf the days of butcher for land are over then what are the Palestinians doing exactly? Lets see here, butcher, and they are doing it for, ummm, land? If you want to bring the UN rules into this then the Palestinians are breaking just about all of them in their terrorist style attacks on Israel so don't go basing your argument on this as it isn't going to work.\n\n \n I don't think you can quite hold a bunch of guerilla fighters to the same standard that you hold a UN country with the strongest military in the region to. For all intents and purposes, that war is still going on. Israel is now having to deal with the guerilla attacks that come following the collase of the military.\n \n \nOne thing about being a country is that you also have the God given right to protect yourself. Israel has not survived this long by being stupid. They know that people like you are out there who would love to seem them driven into the sea. They are not going to give up land to their enemies because the corrupt and uncaring UN says to do so. The UN doesn't care for what happens to Israel so why should Israel care what the UN says? Basically what I'm saying is that Israel controls their own fate, not the UN. The UN is not made to be the all mighty ruler of every country who is involved in the organization. That is why the US was able to go to war with Iraq to protect itself from a future aggressor. That is why China may one day be able to go to war with Taiwan to take what they believe is their own.\n\n \n They have a god given right to protect their own country, not to invade their neiborghs. The UN is mostly full of liberal XXXXXX, I don't think that \"uncaring\" really fits there. A large part of the probelm with the UN is that they are too concerned with diplomacy and justice and not nearly willing enough to smack the big ugly dog with a stick. The UN certainly seem to care what happens to Israel, or they would not have stopped the Arabs and Russians from destroying it. \n \n THe trick ere uis that the UN cares just as much about the Palestenians as they do the Israelis. The UN has a fairly strict set of rules and guidlines they go by. Israel is operaiting WAY outside of those rules. As such, they should not really expect much support from the UN.\n \n \nAttacking Egypt would do nothing? Don't you recall Egypt invading them after they gave back the Sinai? Had Israel taken Cairo and held it think of the power they would have been by the next time they were invaded. They would today probably be in control of the whole of Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon. The only reason this isn't the case is that they went along with what the UN wanted them to do. They gave back much of the land they took. The result? Surprise, surprise, they got invaded again and again. So open your eyes and see the past. Giving up land to their enemies in compliance with UN wishes has never benefited Israel. Don't expect that it will do so in the future either.\n\n \n First off, Israel never could have held egypt. THey are doing about all they can to hold the little strips of land that they are. An extended occupation of Egypt would have been the end of Israel. A nation with basically no economic structer which runs a HUGE trade deficit is not a good canidat for creating an empire. Also, since the number of palestenians is realtively low, they can get away with treating them like dirt. If they actualld DID manage to take egypt, it is pretty doubtful that they would be able to get away with this, even with US backing. Egyptians would almost certainly be made ISraeli citizens and be given rights. This would effectively turn the nation of Israel into another Arab state. In a country which is based almost entirely on racist principals, this is unacceptable. JUst giving the Palestenians the right to vote would be enough to destroy Israel as a racist state.\n \n Israel has enjoyed relativly peceful relations with surrounding countries for several years now. Their problems now are mostly domestic in nature. There are Arab nations that support the palestenian militants, but that is to be expected.\n \n \nI want them to pick a freedom fighter who is in search of peace, not one who has been a killer and a thug his whole life and shows no intention of looking for peace.\n\n \n Freedom fighters fight for freedom, they don't compromise for freedom. They would make them freedom compromisers. Freedom fighters fight, they are not there to make peace, they are there to fight....for freedom...thus the name.\n \n \nSo would you support this style of attack? If so, would you also be in support of Israel's right to defend itself by attempting to capture Syria or Lebanon or both in response due to the fact that Israel was the one that was attacked? I'm guessing that ideally you would support Israel being attacked and then handcuffing them from being able to retaliate as has been done in the past but that is again just a guess.\n\n \n Nope, don't really support it, just saying that given Israels policies, it is a definate possibility, and the amount of international support they are likely to get is pretty small. Most people don't have a whole lot of sympathy for those who shoot themselves in the foot. \n \n As far as attacking Syria or Lebanon in retaliation, I think that first they would have to prove that Syria and LEbanon were responsible for the attack. This seems to be a big problem with the supporters of Israel. They tend to look at the conflict as \"Israel against the Arabs\" instead of \"Israel against the palestenians\".\n \n \nIsrael has a professional army and probably a lot of nuclear weapons. Shadow government or not, they would be able to launch retaliations that would be unmatched throughout history if they wished to do so following such an invasion.\n\n \n Israel has an army of roughly 100,000 men and the ability to maintain combat operations unsupported for 10 days. THey have built their military on the theory that the US will quickly fall in line to support them. They end up in such a situation in a bad position. If they attack surrounding countries in response to a domestic terrorist attack, they look really bad and drive world opinion against them. If they jsut kill of tens of thousands of palestenians, they do the same thing. When Mc Veigh attacked the federal building, we did not launch an attack on Oklahoma on the theory that he was there. In the event that such an attack did take place against Israel, they would have to find the os responsible for it, not just retaliate against Arabs in general.\n \n \nLets put this in the US's situation. OK Washington is gone, nuked by Russia. NORAD is gone, out chain of command has broken down, and our shadow government steps in. You are the person with your finger on the \"button\" just waiting for orders knowing that your capital has just been nuked and your countrymen are dead. Are you saying that you would have launched nukes for the original president even without cause but you would not launch them for a shadow president even with cause? Again, Israel has a professional military. They are not some back ally operation and they would no doubt be able to swiftly respond to any threat such as the one you laid out.\n\n \n And if you know anything about professional armies, you know they DO NOT ACT WITHOUT ORDERS. 90% of the training given to soldier worldwide is specifically aimed at turning them into mindless drones who DO NOT ACT WITHOUT ORDERS. Besdies, if the palestenians managed to get their hands on a nuke and use it against israel, who would israel nuke in retaliation? The gaza strip? The West bank? This could only serve to kill thousands of civilains, shich would ENSURE the destruction of israel as we know it. The Us can only apologize away so much for israel. A nuclear attack apecifically targetibng civilains is more than we could cover.\n \n \nHaving a backup government is just about as theoretical as Israel having nuclear weapons. They are the targets of about every country on the planet and they know it. As for what the UN would do, why do you think a retaliation from Israel would end their state? If they were attacked by a tactical nuke by either a terrorist nation or a country then they would have the full support of the US right off the bat. The US and the UN would quickly attempt to find a solution would inevitably result in an unprecedented attack on the aggressor. Israel has shown restraint recently when asked to do so by the US as seen in the first Gulf War. I think Israel would be willing to get aid from the rest of the world while they prepare for an invasion of their enemy.\n\n \n The problem with \"backup governments\" is that they generally have little or no legal basis. Even is israel, the law does not really support a shadow government tat comes out in the event of an emergency. Who runs this backup government? When were they elected? HOw do you kow the guy who comes out of the woodwork and declared tat he is the new PM, and this was all ordained by the original government, is legitimate? \n \n If Israel was indeed attacked by another nation with anuke, they could indeed count on support from the rest of the world. If they were attacked by the palestenians with a nuke, it is a different story. If, in such an event, they actually DID embark on some form of retalitory attack, you can bet your great aunt bessy silver service that the rest of the world would ot tolerate it. Unlike israel, the rest of te wqorld seems to recognise that the wholesale slaughter of Arabs is NOT an acceptable form of retaliation.\n \n \nJordan and Egypt are both not fond of supporting the Palestinian cause and I'm sure you are aware of that. The Iraqi democracy is not working right now because we had no plan of how to get it to work. It is safe to say that we will devise much better plans in the future before acting. As for Lebanon giving Israel more than they can handle, Lebanon, Israel has twice the population, ten times the economic strength, has far superior weapons, and spends sixteen times as much on military as Lebanon. Lebanon would also quickly look to Syria for help in the case of war with Israel and with Syria out of the picture who would help them? The population of Lebanon would not be fiercely against the Israelis either. Also Israel has taken much larger portions of land in the past than Lebanon and they have managed to do with within days. I'm not sure where Lebanon would be much more than Israel could handle.\n\n \n Jordan an Egypt seem to want to distance themselves fromt he entire mess. Neither seems to really be big on cracking down onthe cross border arms trade, though. Our plan for democracy in Iraq is not working because gunboat diplomacy has NEVER worked in the long term. \n \n As far as Lebanon giving Israel more than they can handle, israel ALREADY has as much (or more) than they can handle with the palestenians in their own borders. There eems to be a misconception that once ou have destroyed the maority of the enemies army you have won. This is not the case, that is when the hard part starts. YOu have to be able to control the domestic ituation on the ground as well. \n \n \nThe Arabs have conceded nothing. They lost their land originally against their will. They lost more land in the future because of attacks they launched. What exactly have they conceded? And what of every nation promising normal relations with Israel? The nations surrounding Israel are not a threat to Israel any longer. It is the terrorists who are and they will not quit fighting just because Israel gives up some land.\n\n \n They have conceded that Israel ha a right to exist. Considering that the nation of israel was created on \"arab\" land (specifically palestenian land) without the consent of the majority of the population, this is a pretty major concession. \n \n Only by normalised relations can Israel every hope to be anything but a welfare state living off of AMerican taxpayers generousity (or stupidity, as the case may be). MAybe this is not important to Israel, but I think as time goes by we will find that it IS important to AMericans. I don;t think that israel can count on unlimited American support forever. \n \n \nThe stupidity falls on all sides. Pride, hate, and ignorance all around. Normalised relations do nothing to stop terrorism. That is the real reason Israel would fall without US help. Their enemies would remain and would never quit. You either fail to understand this or simply don't care. For Israel to survive they have to stamp out terrorism.\n\n \n And with every passing year they create more terrorists. Every tank that fires on a demonstration creates terrorists. Every olive grove that is bulldozed without compensation to make room for tract housing creates terrorists. Every election that goes by where the palestenians are nt alowed ot vote creates terrorists.\n \n \nHow would you like this solution. The Arab nations unite in killing all terrorists who threaten Israel. In return if the terrorist attacks end for one year then Israel will slowly start giving land back to the Arab nations. If you don't agree with this solution because you don't believe it is possible for the Arab nations to stop the terrorist attacks by themselves the in essence you agree with me in that pleasing the nations around Israel does nothing to protect them from their real enemies. So just admit it. The real problem here isn't the US, it isn't the UN, it isn't Israel or Syria or the Arab nations, it is the terrorist tactics of the Palestinian \"freedom fighters\". They make it impossible for Israel to present a concession to the Arabs and make it impossible for the Arab nations to bring an end to this hateful and bloody war. Neither the Arab nations or Israel has any control over when this war ends.\n\n \n \n This is because a concession to other Arab states is not appropriate in this situation. They need to make concessions to the Palestenians. You are not seeing the ethnic difference ere. Not all orientals are chinese, and not all Arabs are palestenians. I understand the confusion, since the ME was only broken into nation states realtively recently. \n \n THe Palestenians have, for all intents and purposes, stopped the attacks. While there are still afew, they are nowhere NEAR the scale that thy were back in the old days of the PLO. For quite a while, there were VERY few attacks. ANd what did it get them? Nothing at all. Israel kept to their same old policies. THe Palestenians kept their word, Israel did not (suprise suprise), so the killing has been picking up a little (Still nowhere near what it was int he old days). I would imagine that, in time, we will see another emergence of a PLO type organisation. THose were REAL militants. After this, we will see more empty promises from ISrael. I would be suprised if the Palestenias were willing to buy into those empty promises this time around.\n \n \nI almost fell off my chair after reading Daewoo's diatribe about how Israel wasn't kicking butt all by themselves in the 6 Day War. \n \n \n THen I would suggest you set a pillow next to your cair and search back through some of these threads. Somewere I posted a link to the report that was comissioned by the israelis following that war. the purpose of the report was to present an explanation for the \"dismal performance of the military\". The guy assigned to write the report was an israeli judge. It took him almost 5 years (if I remember correcty) to document all of the failures of the israeli military.\n \n If you can't find the link, let me know and I can look it up again.",

In reality, the state of israel is almost certainly doomed to failure due to their past policies. Without US aid, the state of israel is NOTHING, and from a realistic standpoint, it seems that the length of time that israel can expect to survive as it has in the past, as a welfare state supported by the US, is extremely limited. \n \n There was an interesting poll done a while back by pew, they were asking americans if they thought that israel was partly responsible for the terrorism problems in the US. Over 60% said \"yes\". This is up almost 30% from a similar poll conducted 18 months before.\n \n Eventually, the American public is going to open its eyes to the fact that terrorism is not soemthing you can fight with planes and tanks, and theyare going to start wondering why we are supporting this little nothing country that does nothing but provide new enemies for us to deal with.\n \n As the American economy declines (and I think a decline is inevitable), it is going to become more and more difficult for the US to justify sending billions of dollars overseas to a nation that gives us nothing but headaches in return. \n \n syklopps61, if you are not going to post relies with content, why bother?

I suppose you could claim that they are fighting for the freedom to be oppressive, but I don't think that is a freedom that we generally recognise.\n\n \n C'mon, I've heard this from you before, this has a bitter grapes tone to it \"yeah, they're strong but only because of US\". What Arab nation over there is strong without any other country's aid (or WITH it for that matter LOL). Frankly, I could care less if it IS because of us, they are an ally and they could annihilate those animals over there in a blink of an eye-works for ME\n \n \nMost likely not. In reality, the state of israel is almost certainly doomed to failure due to their past policies. Without US aid, the state of israel is NOTHING, and from a realistic standpoint, it seems that the length of time that israel can expect to survive as it has in the past, as a welfare state supported by the US, is extremely limited. \n \n \n Well, all I can say is I hope to live to see the day that we develop the technology to use ANYTHING other than oil for our energy needs, and hopefully our leaders will have the guts to thumb our collective noses at the Middle East and let them rot-they could pour oil on their cereal (wait, they may have to get THAT from us too)\n \n \nThere was an interesting poll done a while back by pew, they were asking americans if they thought that israel was partly responsible for the terrorism problems in the US. Over 60% said \"yes\". This is up almost 30% from a similar poll conducted 18 months before.\n\n \n I personally don't put much importance on POLLS, not sure who would..oh wait, someone who worships the U.N. maybe LOL\n \n \nsyklopps61, if you are not going to post relies with content, why bother? Go back, research a little, then maybe you will have something to share that is worth sharing.\n\n \n Well Daewoo, I'll tell you what. I have my opinions and I WILL share them. YOU of course have every right not to respond. Your \"research\" seems somewhat skewed, and I'm sure that WHATEVER research I would come up with, you would immediately dismiss as trash, so rather than waste my time researching, I'll just share my observations. If you would put a little less anti-Jew rantings in your posts and less glorification of a people that are stuck in the 12th century, you might come across as being at least somewhat fair.",

I would say however that five years ago if I thought that terrorists were HERE and going to cause major catastrophe's, you might have said the very same thing about a PERCEIVED threat. Now, if you still think that threats from the Middle East are PERCEIVED....well, not sure what other evidence you need. As far as the Mexicans?

   "\n \n Well, I have tried to read your posts objectively and there is a strong anti-Israeli sentiment running through each one, and it appears that what I see as your hatred of the Israeli's dictates to you what is right and wrong-if the Israeli's did it, it's wrong\n\n \n I am not anti israeli, I am anti israeli real estate and racial policies. Just like I am pro American (being one myself) but I think our foreign policy sucks. Israel had the potential in the beginning to be a great asset tot he middle east. They were organised, they were commited, and a lot of the original occupants of israel were peple with a good working knowledge of business and industry.\n \n Immediatly, they started XXXXXXX these advantages away. They traded potential prosperity for racist propoganda. n of the first things they did once they took power was forced tens of thousands of palestenians from their ancestrial homes, stole whatever money they had in the bank, and forced them from the country. This is the same type of activities that we went into Bosnia to stop.\n \n Instead of being a pillar of the middle east, they have ebcome the albatros around Americas neck. For all intents and purposes, they have no real economy, and there is frankly little hope that they will develop a self sustaining economic base. Instead, they will rely on American handouts forever. Lacking continual American support, Israel has no chance of survival.\n \n This is incredibly disappointing.\n \n While I am extremely contemptful of israels policies when dealing with the palestenians and their apparent complete lack of diplomatic finesse, I do not hate the israeli people, with the exception of a few, like sharon, whoc is a war criminal and should be shot.\n \n \n \nMight be taught, but it sure as hell isn't practiced. Any reasonable person knows that the hatred is taught over there very young, and that \"what the Israeli's do or the Americans do\" is just a bunch of propaganda to make it appear as though it's political and not religious.\n\n \n You are judging hundreds of millions people based on the actions of a few radicals. In many cases, they ARE taught very yound to hate. It would likely take a coupel generations of the US and Israel nt screwing over the Arab people in order to change this. Many of the jews STILL hate germans. As they say, though, time heals all things.\n \n \nYa know, that may well be, but again your hatred of the Israeli's blinds you, because I'm sure that the Israeli's could counter this by saying they were actually there FIRST and were displaced because of all the persecutions they endured. \n \n \n If so, they would be lying. You are getting into ancient history here, but even if you want to go back that far, the jews were latecomers. Many of the stories in the old testament were about the Jews taking control of that region. When rome took the area, the Jews were given their own little section and allowed self rule. When they tried to overthrow the romans, the romans dispersed them.\n \n \nand are those benefits to the U.S. or to all the other third world countries who use the U.N. as a \"legitimate\" way to get what they want from the U.S and other civilized countries\n\n \n Those benifits are to everybody in the UN. Right now, the US is groveling to the UN to try to get them to clean up the mess in Iraq. For larger nations, this is one of the key benifits of the UN, it helps spread the cost of military interventions. \n \n \n \nSo would the destruction of the Arab countries, just depends on who you trust I guess. I would much rather trust the Middle East under the control of the Israeli's than I would ANY Arab country\n\n \n Israel could never control the middle east. Israel has shown itself to be dishonest and unpredictable. The arabs are predictable, they do what benifits them the most. \n \n \n \nIt may shock you, but I support a Palestinian state, but not for the reasons you would hope. I think we should call their bluff-they claim they just want their own land and all the terrorism would stop over there. LMAO, yeah right. Let's give them their land so that Israel would have a right to annihilate them if the attacks continue..and they most definitely would continue\n\n \n I think you might be surprised. THe arabs have proven on several occasions that they will stand by their word. Israel is the party that has proven itself entirely untrustworthy in this conflict. Even in the case that the attaqcks did continue, this would not be justification for israel to \"annihilate\" them. This would be justification to try to take action against the terrorists, not all the palestenians.\n \n You seem to have a real problem with the concept of punishing the guilty. You seem to want to punish everybody based on their nationality. This is not how the world works. If every AMerican got punished every time an American citizen did something bad, there would be very few of us left. \n \n \nNaaa, that's a tough one to swallow, I think it's very much the same, especially the end result (referencing the U.S. or Israel becoming a state of the \"invading\" nationals). And again, it could be argued that the Jews were there first.\n\n \n No, it could not be argued that the jews were there first, nor could it be reasonably argued that the Jews were forced out due to Arab persecution. This just isn't what happened. \n \n \nI made my original comment in response to you calling Israel a racist state, and I don't accept that it is\n\n \n You have GOT to be kidding. This is a nation that has done 3x the ethnic clensing that went on in bosnia. These are folks who guve any Jew who wishes to \"return\" full citizenship, subsidised houseing, and gaurantee them a job. Palestenians who lived there for generations are ineligible for citizenship, are ineligeble for government assistance and are routinely shot by te military. How would you define this if not gross racism?\n \n \nFor a people that have been persecuted as long as the Jews, I personally have no problem with them taking care of their own.\n\n \n Besides Hitler, who has really persecuted the Jews any more than any other group has been persecuted against\" Every ethnic group has at some time been on the short end of the stick. The israelis use it as an excuse. Did ou see the recent poll where a large percentage of europeans polled felt that israel was the greatest threat to peace int he ME? Israels response? Anti sematism. Reality...theya re the ones who continually commit cross border strikes on power stations, murder civilians and are the only country in the region we KNOW have WMDs. \n \n \n \nC'mon, I've heard this from you before, this has a bitter grapes tone to it \"yeah, they're strong but only because of US\". What Arab nation over there is strong without any other country's aid (or WITH it for that matter LOL). Frankly, I could care less if it IS because of us, they are an ally and they could annihilate those animals over there in a blink of an eye-works for ME\n\n \n That is all very interesting. I thought you were going to try to explain to me why israelis should be classed as \"Freedom fighters\". \n \n Good try at a dodge, though/\n \n \n \nWell, all I can say is I hope to live to see the day that we develop the technology to use ANYTHING other than oil for our energy needs, and hopefully our leaders will have the guts to thumb our collective noses at the Middle East and let them rot-they could pour oil on their cereal (wait, they may have to get THAT from us too)\n\n \n Good luck on that. So far, there is nothing ont he horzon likely to replace oil. It is just too good. Even without the oil ttrade, the ME will continue to exist. They always have. Most of the ME has a fairly extensive economic base and industrial infrastructure. They are actually planing for the day that the oil runs out, and ensureing there will be a future for the ME even after that. Even if you factor oil out of the ME economy, they still run a positive trade balance.\n \n \n \nI personally don't put much importance on POLLS, not sure who would..oh wait, someone who worships the U.N. maybe LOL\n\n \n I don't know anybody who worships the UN, so I really couldn't tell you on that one. As far as polls, until you come up with a better way to try to track social trends, I think that a good blind poll is about the best we have. What that particular poll shows shoud be fairly disturbing to the supporters of israel. Is shows that Americans are starting to wake up and wonder why we are supporting a bunch of people who insist on acting like XXXXXX all the time.\n \n \n \nWell Daewoo, I'll tell you what. I have my opinions and I WILL share them. YOU of course have every right not to respond. Your \"research\" seems somewhat skewed, and I'm sure that WHATEVER research I would come up with, you would immediately dismiss as trash, so rather than waste my time researching, I'll just share my observations. If you would put a little less anti-Jew rantings in your posts and less glorification of a people that are stuck in the 12th century, you might come across as being at least somewhat fair.\n\n \n I don;t think I do much anti Jew ranting. Whether it was the Jews, the Polish, or the GErmans that were doing the kind of things that israel is doing, I would be just as critical. I am critical of some of the policies of the US. That doesn;t mean I hate Americans.\n \n All I wa asking is that you actually try to put some supporting facts or even just some justification for your \"thoughts\" (If you are really sure you want to label them as such, I would be embaressed if I really thought about something and that is the best I could come up with). \n \n As far as any research you come up with being immediatly dismissed as \"trash\", I don;t think like that./ My thought processes are rooted in lgic and fact. IF you come up wit a fact that I was unaware of or tat supports your viewpoint, I would be more than happy to hear it.\n \n What you are doing right now is showing that you have very solid opinions on a situation that you know little or nothing about. This is unimpressive.",

   "So, you're telling me that the Isrealis were critical of themselves because it took them 6 days to get to the outskirts of Cairo? WOW! They're even better than I thought. emoticon_xgood\n\n \n They were critical of the fact that they reached the outskirts of cairo, had lost over 80% of their equipment, and over 70% of their troops were COMPLETELY out of ammo and they were unable to resupply them. Not only had they managed to loose the vast majority of THEIR equipment, they managed to loose over a billion dollars worth of equipment that America airlifted to them. They were also critical of the fact that their intelligence was terrible. As they approached Cairo, the Egyptian military was flanking them. According to their intelligence, the maority of the Egyptian military was at the Israeli border, and they thought that once they had run the border they had destroyed the majority of the Egyptian troops. In reality, less than 25% of egypts troops had been at the border, and the remaining 75% was coming up quickly on the unarmed israelis flank.\n \n During their retreat back to israel, they had to leave almost 40% of the equipment that they DID have remaining in Egypt, becasue even with the end of hostilities, theyw ere unable to resupply theri retreating troops and they couldn;t get enough GAS to get their gear back across the border. They ended up blowing it up in the desert.\n \n I am not entirely sure how the israelis managed to spin this as a victory to their own people or to the american public (unless it is the desire to be \"right\" that george keeps pointing out, in this case \"right\" in our choice of allies). By their own report, it was a humiliating defeat. THey like to dwell on \"We were almost to cairo\" but don;t mention that by the time they got there, they had no bullets, no food, no gas, no equipment, and no real possibility of getting any more. They took heavier casualties from civilians killing the unarmed soldiers on the way out than they took from the military on the way in.\n \n If the US had not stepped up and pulled their butts out of the fire before the Egyptian military rolled up behind them, The great and mighty israeli military would have been completely destroyed, and with it the state of israel.\n \n It is all right there, in black and white in the government report The report is still \"classified\" in israel, even though it is widely available throughout the rest of the world. I guess they don;t want their people reading it, they prefer that they believe the lie of the undefeatable israeli military. \n \n The ONLY reason that Israel survived as a state was that the US ran to the UN and got a resolution passed really fast.",

   "No actually I am judging them based on the fact that very few of these hundreds of millions are speaking out against terrorism and the associated atrocities. Not all of them are committing these acts, but their lack of outrage speaks volumes\n \n\n \n What exactly would you like them to do? Ther rest of the world was not particulalrly \"outraged\" by these attacks, they all expressed condolances (including the arabs) but the mass media hypnotised Americans were the only ones who were really surprised. For years most of Europe has been telling us that our foreign policy sucked and that one day we would get hit and hit hard for it. The day finally came. \n \n I think that if you take a long, hard look at some of the world opinion polls, you will find a lot of countruies that are supposed to be our allies have a large percentage of their citizens that harbor a great deal of anti US sentiment. IF you really want the rest of the world to be outraged when we are attacked, we need to quite electing special interest whores into political offices and get rid of this idiotic foreign policy.\n \n \nWell, we could pick and choose when it all began to suit ourselves I suppose-I mean at one time they were probably all the same people and then branched out from there. That's neither here nor there for me, because I don't subscribe to that way of thinking-using your \"logic\" then we would have to give all the land we have taken, and so would every other country. You might not like the way it was done, but it WAS done that way, so why should Israel be expected to give back what they won?\n\n \n I suppose we could pick and choose when it started. In order for your theory to prevail, it would have had to have started in the two years in which the Jews were fighting the revolt with the romans. That is when they totally lost control of the territory. That is when they became a nationless people. If you really want to go back that far, that is fine. In that case, the nation of israel is in the wrong place. They need to move it about 1200 miles and cut it in half.\n \n \nBelieve me, I would rather not have it that way, but when these tactics are employed, what is a nation to do to survive? Are we supposed to give in to our enemies in order to survive? I would not like to live that way, and if it meant taking out \"innocents\", then so be it. When they hide among the civilian population that also supports their actions, it is impossible, by adhering to strict military codes of conduct, to win. This does not make them tougher or anything like that, just means they have sunk to the lowest depths of civilized behavior \n \n \n Well, if you stir a hornets nest, you are going to get stung. The best solution is to just not mess witht he hornets nest. Leave them alon, and they will leave you alone. \n \n If you want a fair fight, I guess the US can leave its tanks and planes at home, and the Arab terrorists can leave their bombs at home, ant they could ll get together and fight it out bare handed. \n \n Coming from a nation whose idea of fair is dropping cluster bombs on civilians from 20,000 feet, you have a pretty warped idea of what a fair fight is.\n \n \nAnd the Palistinians don't? C'mon now LOL\n\n \n Tell you what, you find me one example of this and I will concede the point.\n \n \nHow can I even try to compete with someone with such shining intellect? LMAO I'm not going to get into this argument of \"freedom fighters\"-you think the Arabs are and I dono't, you think the Jews weren't and I do. What's the use?\n\n \n YOu have no factuial basis for your ascertations. YOu are just spouting a bunch of unfounded rhetoric without any logical basis. You keep implying that you have some kind of basis for your claims, but refuse to enlighten the rest of us. Maybe if just once or twice you would actually back up one of your statements with something resembeling a coherent thought, the rest of us could understand the point of your ramblings.\n \n \nOr is it just possible now, that the lazy American people who can Oonly sit still for sound bytes, have just fallen prey to the Goebbel-like propaganda of the left?\n\n \n Americans are not stupid. FOr years we have been LIED TO regarding our policies and relationships in the middle east. In general, we tend to accept what we are told. I think this is the result of wishful thinking. We really wnat to believe that our leaders are doing what is best for the country, and that America is really the greatest country in the world, the keeper f the flame of liberty and justice and all that good stuff. As a result, we tend to give our leaders the benifit of the doubt. \n \n When something happens like the recent terrorist attacks happen, people start to wonder \"why are they so mad at us\". You can seperate the ignorant and the lazy out by seeing who actually bought the \"they are jealous of our freedoms and wealth\" line. The majority of Americans didn;t buy this. And those who were smart enough to see through that weak sound byte actually went out and looked to see exactly why these folks are so upset with us. \n \n Look at the numbers for support of the war in Iraq. Going into the war, we saw a HUGE majority of Americans supporting it. that number has steadily declined since the beginning. THere are some other numbers that keep changing almst in direct corelation to those numbers. That is the number of people who understand what is going on. At the beginning of the war, 70% of americans thought that Iraq was responsible for the 9/11 attacks (5% thought that bin laden was the president of Iraq). Now, 0% belive that Iraq was responsible for the 9/11 attacks. At the beginning of the war, 82% of AMericans thought that Saddam had weapons that could reach the united states. 6 months into the war, the majority of Amerians believed that WMD's had already been found. \n \n IF you look at current polls, most americans know we haven't found any WMD's, know it is unlikely that we will, know the link between Hussein and Al Queda was greatly exagerated, and know that he never had any weapons capable of reaching the US.\n \n Couple this with the fact that it has now become apparent that many Iraqis do not wish to be \"liberated\", the fact that the war is not going particulalrly well, the fact that the drain on our economy due to the war has caused quite a bump in the road, and the relatively low number of people who now support the war is understandable. \n \n The same situation applies to our support of israel. For years our official line has been \"israel good, palestinians scum\". Americans have started to wonder why all these statements from terrorist refer to the israelis so harshly, and why they are attacking America because of it. PEople are starting to look into these things. I watced my father in law go through the process.\n \n At the beginning of this current mess (the war on terror) he said (about israel) \"I think they are pretty harmless as long as you don't mess with them\". I told him \"look into it\". He came back a few days later and ws shocked at the tactics israel has used in the past as well as the fact that America (supposedly the good guys) has supported them through the atrocities they have commited. \n \n Who was it that said \"You can fool all of the people some of the time, and some of the people all of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time\"?\n \n \nOh so easy to say. I didn't think you would admit to the anti-jew rantings, but according to you, it seems like the Arabs have never done anything wrong and the Jews have only committed wrongs. You mock whatever achievements they have and say it's because of the U.S. and that SOMEHOW everything the Arabs have is because of their ingennuity. ROTFLMAO, yeah right.\n\n \n Again, I married a jew. She is in bed right now with my little half jew daughter. I love my jewish wife, and my little half jewish daughter. I get along great with my jewish brother in law. \n \n Perhapse you could give me a list of israels accomplishments that were not made passible directly through American aid and intervention. Lacking US welfare checks, Israel could ot afford to provide DRINKING WATER to their people. I would suggest that you take a look at Israels web page, specifically the part pertaining to GDP. Then, take a look at the amount of US aid given. IT becomes quickly apparent that roughly 80% of israels economy is based on US aid money (make sure you pay attention to how America pays for weapons manufactured by israel and how isral pays for weapons manufactured by the US, it makes a BIG difference)\n \n I also don't recall saying, or even implying that everything the Arabs have is due to their ingenuity. Maybe you could quote it for me. \n \n \nYou sure are pretty high on yourself, I'll give you that LOL\n\n \n High on myself? How so? I simply asked for you to provide some support for your argument. Or are you talking about the little sidebar about your \"thoughts\"? I stand by that one. I would not admit to having thought ut a position that cannot be supported by anything but sarcastic comments and ignorant replies.\n \n \nFunny thing is, being omniscient as you are, no one could come up with a fact that you aren't aware of, so I'll just have to defer to your superior intellect LMAO\n\n \n Ther are lots of facts I am unaware of. I was just asking if maybe you had any that supported your argument. Apparenty the answer is no. THis is kind of too bad. I really do enjoy debating this issue. Some here (my favorite is AMD4EVER) really do an excellent job of it. Their positions are backed by facts and logic. It is pleasurable to debate them, and I learn something new every single time. I left myself wide open for some good replies trying to jump start the debate with you, and all I got was a bunch of incoherent rambling and snide remarks. Not pleasurable, not intellectually stimulating. Boring, like trying to explain to a little kid why they don't fall throught the floor since it is mostly space. \n \n \nIf I was an intellectual wannabe such as yourself, yes I would spend my life researching a wasteland and try to dazzle the world and impress others with what I had found. Trouble is, you really aren't thinking for yourself. I know that's a scary step to take, but try it, it isn't as bad as you might think\n\n \n Actually, I haven't spent that much time researching the middle east. Most of what I learned about the ME was during my poli sci coursework in college. I do think that their history is really interesting, and read quite a bit on the subject. I don;t devote that much time to it.\n \n If trying to back my arguments up with facts and logic makes me an intellectual wannabe, I wear that badge with pride.",

Maybe if just once or twice you would actually back up one of your statements with something resembeling a coherent thought, the rest of us could understand the point of your ramblings.\n\n \n You speak with such authority but I don't see links or \"footnotes\" to all this factual info ( I will tell you up front that although I would read them, I would take them with a grain of salt. I mean, I could go to the KKK site and find \"research\"). It seems to me that you do actually find SOME facts perhaps but then use that as a basis to claim everything else you say is a fact. Many of your responses to me appear to be your OPINION. You are SO knowledgeable in this area, based on a few classes years ago, that whenever I say something you immediately dismiss it, rather than saying \"I'll have to get back to you on that\". I don't claim to know everything, but seems to me that someone doing research as you claim, would at least OCCASIONALLY be a little stumped and would have to check into things\n \n \n \nAmericans are not stupid\n. \n \n I never said stupid, just lazy, please don't put words in my mouth now\n \n \nYou can seperate the ignorant and the lazy out by seeing who actually bought the \"they are jealous of our freedoms and wealth\" line. The majority of Americans didn;t buy this.\n\n \n First of all, I never heard this spouted around the world as a theory...yep thought of it myself (not saying others haven't said same opinion) and it didn't hurt a bit either LOL Seems to me that whoever thought of this was actually thinking for themselves and not buying some line from the press. You totally disregard this possibility. Are you SO in tune with the culture there that this couldn't be even the slightest possibility? \n \n \nLook at the numbers for support of the war in Iraq. Going into the war, we saw a HUGE majority of Americans supporting it. that number has steadily declined since the beginning. \n \n \n GOD, please tell me you won't ever run for office LOL The press has worn down the people with tales of woe, deliberately concealing any good that has come from this war. And no, I'm not saying everything has been perfect, but not all is bad either. When ALL is bad, one must wonder about an underlying agenda. This is my main beef with you-Israel has done ALL bad to you, and no impartial research would reflect this opinion \n \n \nCouple this with the fact that it has now become apparent that many Iraqis do not wish to be \"liberated\", the fact that the war is not going particulalrly well, the fact that the drain on our economy due to the war has caused quite a bump in the road, and the relatively low number of people who now support the war is understandable. \n\n \n No doubt \"research\" obtained from ABC WORLD NEWS TONIGHT LMAO\n \n \nAgain, I married a jew. She is in bed right now with my little half jew daughter. I love my jewish wife, and my little half jewish daughter. I get along great with my jewish brother in law. \n \n \n If I recall correctly, you also stated that your wife couldn't pick out Israel on a map. There are some people who have either no interest in certain matters, or simply have a self hatred (Hate America First crowd!)\n \n \nI also don't recall saying, or even implying that everything the Arabs have is due to their ingenuity. Maybe you could quote it for me. \n \n \n In my opinion it is certainly implied by your frequent statements (ad nauseum by the way) that Israel ONLY has accomplished things because of the U.S. and never once making reference to the Arabs in the same context\n \n \nHigh on myself? How so? I simply asked for you to provide some support for your argument. Or are you talking about the little sidebar about your \"thoughts\"? I stand by that one. I would not admit to having thought ut a position that cannot be supported by anything but sarcastic comments and ignorant replies.\n\n \n Sky high buddy LMAO I refer to my earlier post about sites and \"footnotes\" Many of your \"facts\" appear to me to be an inflated ago, \"what I say goes\" kinda thing. I have never stated that what I'm saying is right, UNLIKE you, and THAT sir is where you drop the ball\n \n \nI left myself wide open for some good replies trying to jump start the debate with you, and all I got was a bunch of incoherent rambling and snide remarks.\n \n \n No, what you got were responses you didn't like\n \n \nCan you say the same about your \"ignorant racist\" badge?\n\n\n \n AHHH a typical response, you either are a minority or a Liberal (OOOOOPS bad word) I'd love to see you qoute me about this racist accusation-defending Israel is racist? Whatever credibility you may have had (certainly not much with me) goes out the window with that accusation",

   "I don't assume the UN is right and the US is wrong. THis particular situation is such a mess that the line between who si right and who is wrong is non-existant. I bring the UN into this simply for the fact that as UN nations, bth Israel and the US have agreed to abide by the rules of the UN. IF we no longer wish to do so, we have only to leave the UN. Barring that, we are bound to follow the rules as set forth by that body. It is a question of integrity. I realise that I am just a poor dumb hick from kansas, but I was under the impression that when you made a deal, you stuck to it.\n\n \n If the line between right and wrong doesn't exist in this situation how can you be so sure that Israel is wrong?\n \n What does giving into the UN requests have to do with integrity? If the US government said you have to leave your home and give it to your worst enemy but one person somewhere in the government managed to stand up for you and helped you keep your home against the will of the US government then would you lack integrity if you stayed in your home? This is what it really comes down to when you are the one who they are coming after. It is so easy to sit here safely in Kansas or Michigan or anywhere else in the US and play politician. But if it were happening to us you would actually have to deal with reality. The Israelis have only one home and are being attacked for having it. The Palestinians could find homes anywhere in the entire Middle East except for Israel and they demand more. If I were the Israeli's I would also be telling the UN to shove it. Also concerning the supposed moral high ground you must believe the UN has while the US and Israel lack integrity, lets not forget that based on UN rules the US and Israel are doing what is right in the eyes of the UN. The US has the right to overrule popular UN opinion and they have giving Israel the right to maintain the land they have. So basically they are doing nothing wrong. This may only be because the UN is a flawed organization but I don't know how you can construe this into being the fault of the US and Israel.\n \n \nI will admit that my views on this may be a little old fashioned. I routinely do business on a hand shake, and consider the deals sealed in such a manner every bit as binding as agreements sealed with a hundred page contract. Way back at the creatin of the UN, we took a look and decided that ws somethign we wanted to be part of. There are benifits to being a UN nation, and the only real drawback is that you mut agree to abide by the rules the UN has set forth. We agreed to this. NOw it is time to pony up and follow thse rules. Membership in the UN is strictly voluntary, if we don't want to live by their rules, we can always unvolunteer.\n\n \n Again, pony up to what rules? We are following the rules. Show me where we are not following the rules right now. We are not following popular opinion, but the rules we are following.\n \n \nIsrael is not an agressor? Are you kidding? They used terrorist tactics and back room dealing to obtain their nation. The first thing they did was embark on a policy of ethnic cleansing. To me, this is agression. Montelban has shown an absolute ignorance of the middle east and the ARab people, no more.\n\n \n I'm not talking about what happened in the formation of Israel, I'm talking about all the examples you are shelling out that happened recently. In each of the recent occasions Israel has been responding to aggression. That is all they are doing at this point hence my example. Also if you look back at what has happened right after the formation of Israel they were again forced to react to aggression. Then again and again and again until now they hold land equal to many times what they were originally meant to have. They are the ones under attack and have been for decades.\n \n \nIt seems that world opinion has turned drastically against Israel. I think it is fair to say that the ONLY thing standing between Israel and complete destruction is the US. \n\n \n The only thing standing between the Arabs and complete destruction is the UN. So what? Also show me where world opinion supports the Palestinians or the Arab nations. Your argument here only focuses on one side of the argument, like always. I stated that Israel and the Palestinians are both treated as unpopular and you respond with a quote that includes only the Israelis being unpopular. This is the skewing that you take part in throughout this entire debate. You truly are anti-Israel regardless of what the facts are and it shows.\n \n \nFewer than 10% of the jewish population of Israel lives in these areas. How many troops could they possibly be drawing from these areas?\n\n \n Just correcting your statement that the Israelis are \"not drawing troops\" from this area.\n \n \nAS far as segregating themselves from their enemies, what I am saying is that these areas they have occupied are full of enemies of Israel. RIght now, they are, for all intents and purposes, operating inside Israel. IF ISrael were to actually withdraw from the occupied territories, they woudl be able to secure their border. AS things stand right now, it will never be possible for them to do so, short of killing every palestenian in the ocuntry (And I don't doubt for even one second that they would not do this if they thought they could get away with it).\n\n \n This tactic may work in the short run but again you are having the Israeli's weakening themselves while strengthening the enemies position. However this can be countered using one of syklopps61's statements. I do think that if Israel did give up this land in order to create a Palestinian nation they should include in the agreement that any attack by a Palestinian against Israel after that point would be considered a direct attack by Palestine against Israel. That would mean Palestine would exist for about two hours before Israel had to declare war on them and show the Palestinians for who they are. A blood thirsty and out of control mob. Then I guess Israel could legally move in and kill every Palestinian.\n \n \nWhat Israel has done is more akin to if the US declared Iraq a 51st state. This would open the door to all kinds of attacks on the US. We sould effectively be importing terrorists. THis is what Israel has done. They have effectively brought the terrorists to their country.\n\n \n Again I do agree with this but giving up on Iraq right now would not solve our problems and may in fact increase them. Iraq could become a major terrorist training location if we let them be right now and that could mean major attacks on us in the future. If we kept them as a 51st state we could at least control the Iraqi borders and try and prevent any major terrorist training camps. Sure it would be difficult to prevent any attacks from them but it may be worse to give them up to the terrorists than it would be for us to try and keep the under control ourselves.\n \n \nI don't think you can quite hold a bunch of guerilla fighters to the same standard that you hold a UN country with the strongest military in the region to. For all intents and purposes, that war is still going on. Israel is now having to deal with the guerilla attacks that come following the collase of the military.\n\n \n Double standard in your favor eh? Well lets say we give them their own land and they continue these guerilla tactics. What then? And don't say they won't because you have already stated that you would like to see Israel whipped off the face of the earth so I doubt there are not at least a few Palestinians who feel the same way. Terrorists attacks on Israel have also been a way of life for many decades and saying they will give that up cold turkey is extremely unlikely. So what does Israel do after they get attacked again? Invade and be demanded to leave again?\n \n \nThey have a god given right to protect their own country, not to invade their neiborghs. The UN is mostly full of liberal XXXXXX, I don't think that \"uncaring\" really fits there. A large part of the probelm with the UN is that they are too concerned with diplomacy and justice and not nearly willing enough to smack the big ugly dog with a stick. The UN certainly seem to care what happens to Israel, or they would not have stopped the Arabs and Russians from destroying it. \n\n \n Their neighbors invaded them. As for the UN, they are not just liberal, they are politicians. As politicians they are looking out for themselves and those who can help them. They do not care for doing what is right. That is how uncaring fits them. The UN cannot handle what is happening in Israel today because their original purpose was to stand up and prevent another world war. There is a world war occurring right now and that is the war on terror. The war on terror pits them against the Palestinians while their resolutions pit them against Israel. The UN is handcuffed in this situation. You will not see them stepping in and smacking either big ugly dog with a stick. You can see the dilemma they face.\n \n \nTHe trick ere uis that the UN cares just as much about the Palestenians as they do the Israelis. The UN has a fairly strict set of rules and guidlines they go by. Israel is operaiting WAY outside of those rules. As such, they should not really expect much support from the UN.\n\n \n Again focusing on just one side of the story. The Palestinians are also operating WAY outside those rules. Hence the handcuffed UN. If one side just started playing the true role of the victim perhaps the UN would back them but instead both sides play the aggressive role meaning the UN won't help either side.\n \n \nFirst off, Israel never could have held egypt. THey are doing about all they can to hold the little strips of land that they are. An extended occupation of Egypt would have been the end of Israel. A nation with basically no economic structer which runs a HUGE trade deficit is not a good canidat for creating an empire. Also, since the number of palestenians is realtively low, they can get away with treating them like dirt. If they actualld DID manage to take egypt, it is pretty doubtful that they would be able to get away with this, even with US backing. Egyptians would almost certainly be made ISraeli citizens and be given rights. This would effectively turn the nation of Israel into another Arab state. In a country which is based almost entirely on racist principals, this is unacceptable. JUst giving the Palestenians the right to vote would be enough to destroy Israel as a racist state.\n\n \n I agree with some of what you are saying here. However I don't agree with the whole of it because history has shown that it is possible for such an expansion to occur. One possible way to succeed in this would be to tax the Egyptian people, use their resources to solidify their position, and in turn slowly begin to force them out of their own country. That is a tactic used by the US to build its empire. With the support of the US I believe Israel could have taken a large part of Egypt and held onto it.\n \n \n \nIsrael has enjoyed relativly peceful relations with surrounding countries for several years now. Their problems now are mostly domestic in nature. There are Arab nations that support the palestenian militants, but that is to be expected.\n\n \n Thank goodness for this peace. I hope it extends to booting the terrorist organizations out of some of these nations in order to further the peace.\n \n \nFreedom fighters fight for freedom, they don't compromise for freedom. They would make them freedom compromisers. Freedom fighters fight, they are not there to make peace, they are there to fight....for freedom...thus the name.\n\n \n What is so great about Arafat? As a freedom fighter he has taken aid specifically ear marked for Palestinians and kept it for himself. Millions and millions of dollars. He is a very rich man now and no doubt he has abused his power to achieve even more than this. This goes to show money is as much on his mind as freedom so he IS a freedom compromiser. It is no wonder the Palestinians cannot have any success or peace under his watch.\n \n \nNope, don't really support it, just saying that given Israels policies, it is a definate possibility, and the amount of international support they are likely to get is pretty small. Most people don't have a whole lot of sympathy for those who shoot themselves in the foot. \n\n \n So you wouldn't feel sorry for this happening to Israel? I could debate just as easily that the US is shooting themselves in the foot and may have this type of attack against us one day. Will you feel sorry for us when it happens?\n \n \nAs far as attacking Syria or Lebanon in retaliation, I think that first they would have to prove that Syria and LEbanon were responsible for the attack. This seems to be a big problem with the supporters of Israel. They tend to look at the conflict as \"Israel against the Arabs\" instead of \"Israel against the palestenians\".\n\n \n Afghanistan didn't attack the WTC. We proved that they supported the people who did however. Syria and Lebanon support the people who would be responsible. Israel would not have to directly link the countries to the attack. That is why I strongly recommend that Syria and Lebanon drop their support for terrorists otherwise they will be in a bad way when some terrorist goes too far.\n \n \nIsrael has an army of roughly 100,000 men and the ability to maintain combat operations unsupported for 10 days. THey have built their military on the theory that the US will quickly fall in line to support them. They end up in such a situation in a bad position. If they attack surrounding countries in response to a domestic terrorist attack, they look really bad and drive world opinion against them. If they jsut kill of tens of thousands of palestenians, they do the same thing. When Mc Veigh attacked the federal building, we did not launch an attack on Oklahoma on the theory that he was there. In the event that such an attack did take place against Israel, they would have to find the os responsible for it, not just retaliate against Arabs in general.\n\n \n If it is a domestic attack then martial law would be implemented but the terrorists didn't make plutonium on their own either. Someone made it and it is possible to find out who it was. After that Israel will not stand alone in fighting whoever it was that holds responsibility for it. They will have the US and the UN. The same would be true with Mc Veigh. If Mexico had sponsored him and given him chemical weapons to use in his attack then Mexico would be in a great deal of trouble even if they didn't directly commit the attack.\n \n \nAnd if you know anything about professional armies, you know they DO NOT ACT WITHOUT ORDERS. 90% of the training given to soldier worldwide is specifically aimed at turning them into mindless drones who DO NOT ACT WITHOUT ORDERS. Besdies, if the palestenians managed to get their hands on a nuke and use it against israel, who would israel nuke in retaliation? The gaza strip? The West bank? This could only serve to kill thousands of civilains, shich would ENSURE the destruction of israel as we know it. The Us can only apologize away so much for israel. A nuclear attack apecifically targetibng civilains is more than we could cover.\n\n \n If they do not act without orders and are trained to follow orders then it is logical to say that if told to follow a shadow government that they will do so if their old government has been destroyed. Again, the nuke came from somewhere. The Palestinians didn't just make it themselves in the west bank.\n \n \nThe problem with \"backup governments\" is that they generally have little or no legal basis. Even is israel, the law does not really support a shadow government tat comes out in the event of an emergency. Who runs this backup government? When were they elected? HOw do you kow the guy who comes out of the woodwork and declared tat he is the new PM, and this was all ordained by the original government, is legitimate? \n\n \n Backup governments are temporary solutions to a problem. They are not going to be elected but they will stand in place of a fallen government until an election can occur. As far as the legitimacy goes, the Israelis are not a back ally operation as I have stated before. They will have a plan in place just as the US would if our government was destroyed. It will not be a mystery as to who is in charge after a catastrophic event such as this.\n \n \nIf Israel was indeed attacked by another nation with anuke, they could indeed count on support from the rest of the world. If they were attacked by the palestenians with a nuke, it is a different story. If, in such an event, they actually DID embark on some form of retalitory attack, you can bet your great aunt bessy silver service that the rest of the world would ot tolerate it. Unlike israel, the rest of te wqorld seems to recognise that the wholesale slaughter of Arabs is NOT an acceptable form of retaliation.\n\n \n Once again, the nuke came from somewhere. The Israelis would quickly find out where it came from and insist that the rest of the world fall in line with them in their attack of the aggressor nation. I'm not sure where you think this nuke came from. It didn't just magically appear in the hands of some terrorist and the sure as hell didn't just walk into an Israeli nuclear site and run off with one.\n \n \nJordan an Egypt seem to want to distance themselves fromt he entire mess. Neither seems to really be big on cracking down onthe cross border arms trade, though. Our plan for democracy in Iraq is not working because gunboat diplomacy has NEVER worked in the long term. \n\n \n Of course it has worked. It worked in Japan after WWII.\n \n \nAs far as Lebanon giving Israel more than they can handle, israel ALREADY has as much (or more) than they can handle with the palestenians in their own borders. There eems to be a misconception that once ou have destroyed the maority of the enemies army you have won. This is not the case, that is when the hard part starts. YOu have to be able to control the domestic ituation on the ground as well. \n\n \n Israel is far from being over run by the Palestinians. They have enough forces to go into Lebanon without a problem and take control of that country. Controlling the masses would as always prove to be difficult but Israel has far more experience in this sort of thing than the US. The US is playing softball with the Iraqi people while Israel would go right for the strong armed approach. This approach is much more effective in controlling a population.\n \n \nThey have conceded that Israel ha a right to exist. Considering that the nation of israel was created on \"arab\" land (specifically palestenian land) without the consent of the majority of the population, this is a pretty major concession. \n\n \n They have not conceded that otherwise they would stop harboring terrorists who attack Israel. If I Billy Bob has the right to exist but keep helping people to try and kill him do I really seem to be standing by my words?\n \n \nOnly by normalised relations can Israel every hope to be anything but a welfare state living off of AMerican taxpayers generousity (or stupidity, as the case may be). MAybe this is not important to Israel, but I think as time goes by we will find that it IS important to AMericans. I don;t think that israel can count on unlimited American support forever. \n\n \n How can there be normalized relations if they are under attack constantly. So lets again form Palestine and see if they act as a proper country or if they just become another Syria/Lebanon and harbor terrorists who go after Israel. Then again, lets not even waste our time. Of course they will do that. Then Israel will have to again march on Palestinian land and again the world will be up in arms about Israeli aggression. How can normalize relations even be achieved without the destruction of one side?\n \n \nAnd with every passing year they create more terrorists. Every tank that fires on a demonstration creates terrorists. Every olive grove that is bulldozed without compensation to make room for tract housing creates terrorists. Every election that goes by where the palestenians are nt alowed ot vote creates terrorists.\n\n \n Oh and giving into the terrorists will create less terrorists? Show me where in all of history this has worked? Why do you think the US has a policy of not dealing with terrorists? It is because this policy brings us less terrorists than dealing with them does. Give a terrorist a small piece of land and he will only want more.\n \n \nThis is because a concession to other Arab states is not appropriate in this situation. They need to make concessions to the Palestenians. You are not seeing the ethnic difference ere. Not all orientals are chinese, and not all Arabs are palestenians. I understand the confusion, since the ME was only broken into nation states realtively recently. \n\n \n My point is that even though the Arab nations want this violence to end they cannot do anything to end it and now we can tack onto that they are not even willing to help end it because there is nothing in it for them as you have stated. How in the world do you expect that creating a Palestinian nation will end terrorist attacks from Syria and Lebanon much less other Palestinians?\n \n \nTHe Palestenians have, for all intents and purposes, stopped the attacks. While there are still afew, they are nowhere NEAR the scale that thy were back in the old days of the PLO. For quite a while, there were VERY few attacks. ANd what did it get them? Nothing at all. Israel kept to their same old policies. THe Palestenians kept their word, Israel did not (suprise suprise), so the killing has been picking up a little (Still nowhere near what it was int he old days). I would imagine that, in time, we will see another emergence of a PLO type organisation. THose were REAL militants. After this, we will see more empty promises from ISrael. I would be suprised if the Palestenias were willing to buy into those empty promises this time around.\n\n \n Very few attacks? How about no attacks is what was agreed upon. But we all know by this point that it would be impossible to stop the terrorists. Some simply don't care about the land and just want to deal pain to Israelis. These are the people who will make it impossible for peace to ever exist.\n \n So far we have no solutions to this problem. The UN is handcuffed, Syria and Lebanon support of terrorists makes peace through satisfying the Palestinians impossible, and Israel will not give up land for something close to peace. I think if there were a solution that ended support for terrorism in Syria and Lebanon that would be a big step forward in solving this problem. Of course all other Arab nations bordering Israel would also have to stop any behind the scenes support of terrorism as well.",

And let's not forget 5% of our crude was coming from pre-invasion Iraq, the same as Columbia, where we've recently stepped up military aid and 'advisors' under the guise of policing dope, another of our nation building crusades. In spite of Baker's flimsy publicity attempts for nations to forgive Iraqi debt, those countries who opposed our invasion of Iraq existing investments and contracts with Iraq are drawing interest and become reactivated in 2007. As an agressor invader under Geneva Agreements, we get zero compensation for 'doing the right thing' in Iraq, but are required to rebuild it, and those foreign investments made by other countries at our expense. Foreign policy so brilliant it blinds me. I wonder if the next diversion from our own problems will be Canada since they now have the second largest oil reserves in the world.",

   "If the line between right and wrong doesn't exist in this situation how can you be so sure that Israel is wrong?\n\n \n First of all, I am glad you are back. I was afraid you had jumped ship.\n \n What I was trying to say here is that no side can take the moral high ground here. The entire situation has become such a mess, with both sides committing such evil acts (though you must admit israels evil acts have been much greater in scale than the palestenians), that it is nearly impossible for either side to claim to be ont he side of right and justice.\n \n \nWhat does giving into the UN requests have to do with integrity? If the US government said you have to leave your home and give it to your worst enemy but one person somewhere in the government managed to stand up for you and helped you keep your home against the will of the US government then would you lack integrity if you stayed in your home? This is what it really comes down to when you are the one who they are coming after. It is so easy to sit here safely in Kansas or Michigan or anywhere else in the US and play politician. But if it were happening to us you would actually have to deal with reality.\n \n \n Our laws do not allow for the government ot simply move in and take your home. The governments hands are more or less tied in this matter. International law does not allow you to invade other countries, or portions of other countries. The UN's job is to enforce this. International law says this must be enforced. THe UN enforced this in kuwait, they should do the same in the case of israel. You should ot make deals with law breakers. You punish them then move on.\n \n \nThe Israelis have only one home and are being attacked for having it. The Palestinians could find homes anywhere in the entire Middle East except for Israel and they demand more. If I were the Israeli's I would also be telling the UN to shove it. Also concerning the supposed moral high ground you must believe the UN has while the US and Israel lack integrity, lets not forget that based on UN rules the US and Israel are doing what is right in the eyes of the UN. The US has the right to overrule popular UN opinion and they have giving Israel the right to maintain the land they have. So basically they are doing nothing wrong. This may only be because the UN is a flawed organization but I don't know how you can construe this into being the fault of the US and Israel.\n\n \n They have given isreal the right to occupy territory not theirs, engage in ethnic cleansing, and treat a huge slice of their population as second class citizens. The argument for giving veto power to the US in SC matters (As well as the other nations that enjoy veto power) was to ensure that the SC was not taken over by a rogue faction of countries that refused to upold the law. I think it is odd that the US has ended up being that rogue faction.\n \n \n \nAgain, pony up to what rules? We are following the rules. Show me where we are not following the rules right now. We are not following popular opinion, but the rules we are following.\n\n \n You cannot possibly read the charter and declarations of the UN, the body that we have agreed to alow to set international law, and come to the conclusion that israel is not in gross violation of dozens of those laws. This is like going to trial and paying off the judge then claiming the trial was legitimate.\n \n \nI'm not talking about what happened in the formation of Israel, I'm talking about all the examples you are shelling out that happened recently. In each of the recent occasions Israel has been responding to aggression. That is all they are doing at this point hence my example. Also if you look back at what has happened right after the formation of Israel they were again forced to react to aggression. Then again and again and again until now they hold land equal to many times what they were originally meant to have. They are the ones under attack and have been for decades.\n\n \n Even looking at the events of late, israel continues its policies of agression. It was just last week that they fired tank rounds and missiles at protestors. \n \n \nThe only thing standing between the Arabs and complete destruction is the UN. So what? Also show me where world opinion supports the Palestinians or the Arab nations. Your argument here only focuses on one side of the argument, like always. I stated that Israel and the Palestinians are both treated as unpopular and you respond with a quote that includes only the Israelis being unpopular. This is the skewing that you take part in throughout this entire debate. You truly are anti-Israel regardless of what the facts are and it shows.\n\n \n Not just the UN, also the fact that it is difficult to drill for oil in a nuclear waste land. \n \n The only poll I am aware of that covers this is from the pew folks. It is at http://people-press.org/reports/print.php3?PageID=456 \n \n Q.11 In the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians, which side do you sympathize\n with more, Israel or the Palestinians?\n (VOL) (VOL)\n Israel Palestinians Both Neither DK/Ref\n US 41 13 6 21 19=100\n Mid-October, 2001 47 10 8 18 17=100\n Early September, 2001 40 17 6 23 14=100\n September, 1997 48 13 5 16 18=100\n September, 1993 45 21 3 18 12=100\n Chicago CFR: 1990 34 13 7 26 20=100\n Chicago CFR: 1982 41 17 8 19 16=100\n Chicago CFR: 1978 39 12 8 15 13=100\n \n Britain 17 28 11 23 21=100\n \n Italy 14 30 15 32 9=100\n \n Germany 24 26 4 33 13=100\n \n France 19 36 8 25 12=100\n \n \n I would like to see some more if you have them since this one only covers four other countries.\n \n \nJust correcting your statement that the Israelis are \"not drawing troops\" from this area.\n\n \n Ok, I suppose they may possibly be pulling as much as 10% of their troops from these areas. Since a pullout would certainly include relocating those jewish settlers, they would not loose any of their armed forces, so the point is moot.\n \n \nThis tactic may work in the short run but again you are having the Israeli's weakening themselves while strengthening the enemies position. However this can be countered using one of syklopps61's statements. I do think that if Israel did give up this land in order to create a Palestinian nation they should include in the agreement that any attack by a Palestinian against Israel after that point would be considered a direct attack by Palestine against Israel. That would mean Palestine would exist for about two hours before Israel had to declare war on them and show the Palestinians for who they are. A blood thirsty and out of control mob. Then I guess Israel could legally move in and kill every Palestinian.\n\n \n Kill the good with the bad based on race. I seem to have heard this before. MAybe we could build camps where we could put concentrations of these folks. We could call them concentration camps! We could call this the \"final solution\" since it would provide a \"final solution\" to the problem.\n \n \n \nAgain I do agree with this but giving up on Iraq right now would not solve our problems and may in fact increase them. Iraq could become a major terrorist training location if we let them be right now and that could mean major attacks on us in the future. If we kept them as a 51st state we could at least control the Iraqi borders and try and prevent any major terrorist training camps. Sure it would be difficult to prevent any attacks from them but it may be worse to give them up to the terrorists than it would be for us to try and keep the under control ourselves.\n\n \n If we did make Iraq the 51st state, ther is no doubt that we would give the iraqi people rights, including the right to vote. To do otherwise would be reprehensible. This is what israel has effectively done.\n \n \n \nDouble standard in your favor eh? Well lets say we give them their own land and they continue these guerilla tactics. What then? And don't say they won't because you have already stated that you would like to see Israel whipped off the face of the earth so I doubt there are not at least a few Palestinians who feel the same way. Terrorists attacks on Israel have also been a way of life for many decades and saying they will give that up cold turkey is extremely unlikely. So what does Israel do after they get attacked again? Invade and be demanded to leave again?\n\n \n I am sure that there are palestenians who feel the same way. After all, the israelis have kieeld over 100,000 palestenians, possibly over 200,000 palestenians, since the inception of israel. When the israli army attacked the civilian neiborghoods in the palestenian section of beiruit, they killed over 40,000 in 3 days. Just giving back the palestenians land won't make up for this. Tere is a real possibilty that htere would still be attacks by Palestenians. This is something that israel may just have to deal with for a generation or two. There is a line that people sometimes cross between just \"Really bad\" and truly evil. You can expect forgiveness for \"Really bad\" based on some simple reperations. Forgiveness for \"truly evil\" takes longer. This is just one of the consequences of doing things that are truly evil.\n \n \nTheir neighbors invaded them. As for the UN, they are not just liberal, they are politicians. As politicians they are looking out for themselves and those who can help them. They do not care for doing what is right. That is how uncaring fits them. The UN cannot handle what is happening in Israel today because their original purpose was to stand up and prevent another world war. There is a world war occurring right now and that is the war on terror. The war on terror pits them against the Palestinians while their resolutions pit them against Israel. The UN is handcuffed in this situation. You will not see them stepping in and smacking either big ugly dog with a stick. You can see the dilemma they face.\n\n \n The ony thing handcuffing the UN in this situation is the US. The palestenians, by legal definition, are freedom fighters. That is why the US kind of has their hands tied when it comes to dealing with them.\n \n \n Again focusing on just one side of the story. The Palestinians are also operating WAY outside those rules. Hence the handcuffed UN. If one side just started playing the true role of the victim perhaps the UN would back them but instead both sides play the aggressive role meaning the UN won't help either side.\n \n \n \n \nI agree with some of what you are saying here. However I don't agree with the whole of it because history has shown that it is possible for such an expansion to occur. One possible way to succeed in this would be to tax the Egyptian people, use their resources to solidify their position, and in turn slowly begin to force them out of their own country. That is a tactic used by the US to build its empire. With the support of the US I believe Israel could have taken a large part of Egypt and held onto it.\n\n \n Israel tried to take a large part of egypt with US support and failed. tehre was a report created at the request of the israeli government, by an israeli official, that outlined exactly how bad these failures were and what caused them. I believe I linked it in another thread. According to that report, the israelis ended up less than 100 miles from cairo in some cases, but had lost 80% of their equipment, PLUS a billion dollars worth of equipment that the US had airlifted to them. OVer 70% of the israeli soldiers were effectively diasrmed, as they were out of ammo. The men were stealing chickens to eat becasue the israelis could not resupply thier own troops. ON the way out of egypt, the israelis were forced to destroy over 40% of the equipent they had left because even after the US had forced a resolution through the UNSC and hostilities had ended, israel was STILL not able to get fuel to their troops. \n \n The only way this could happen is if the US and israel made an orcastrated, planned effort involving US troops. The rest of the world would not allow this, UN or no. This is one problem with americas economy. We are no longer a manufatuiring powerhouse and we run a huge trade deficit. This is the kind of thing that could realistically lead to trade sanctions against the US, which would be absolutly disasterous for us.\n \n Drifting from the topic for just a second, this is the problem with those who would say \"screw what the rest of the world thinks\". They are living in an America that has been gone for 50 years or more. In that America, we had a manufaturing based economy and a positive trade balance. We were not dependant on the rest of the world to suply us with goods. We were also not dependant ont he rest of the world to finance our debt. In todays America, there IS no America without the rest of the world.\n \n \nThank goodness for this peace. I hope it extends to booting the terrorist organizations out of some of these nations in order to further the peace.\n\n \n this is one of the advantages I see to israel making some concessions to the Palestenians. It seems that, while immediate peace from the palestenians is not assured, more cooperations from surrounding countries could certainly be assured. It could even be secured by treaty before granting the concessions. If they could do this, it would seriosly erode the palestenian militants abilities to attack israel. This is what the Saudis offered, and frankly I think that israel shoud have taken them up on it. \n \n \n \nWhat is so great about Arafat? As a freedom fighter he has taken aid specifically ear marked for Palestinians and kept it for himself. Millions and millions of dollars. He is a very rich man now and no doubt he has abused his power to achieve even more than this. This goes to show money is as much on his mind as freedom so he IS a freedom compromiser. It is no wonder the Palestinians cannot have any success or peace under his watch.\n\n \n I am not fond of the man personally, but he is the kind of man you need leading freedom fighters. He is a true believer. You are right, he pays himself well, possibly too well, but that is almost always the case in such situations. \n \n \nSo you wouldn't feel sorry for this happening to Israel? I could debate just as easily that the US is shooting themselves in the foot and may have this type of attack against us one day. Will you feel sorry for us when it happens?\n\n \n THe us shot itself in the foot years ago. As far as feeling sorry for us in the wake of such an attack, no I wouldn't. I didn;t feel sorry for us in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. I felt terrible for the people who lost friends and family member in those attacks (I don't waste sympathy on the dead, they are beyond the point where it is constructive). I didn;t feel sorry for America as a whole. Analysts have been saying for years that we could expect such attacks. It was not a question of if, but a question of when. They are saying the same thing about a nuclear attack (and have been doing so for years). America has run roughshod over the world, exploited too many people, installed and supported too many dictators, and supported too many tyranical governments. In the end, all bills come due. It is apparently time for America to pay. Frankly, I am surprised it took this long. \n \n I think that we can absolutly expect such an attack. There are too many weapons missing from the former soviet states, too many chemical and bio weapons floating around (many of them originally designed and supplied by us) and too many people out there that are angry with the US to draw any conclusion BUT that this will someday happen if we don't change our SOP. \n \n \n \nAfghanistan didn't attack the WTC. We proved that they supported the people who did however. Syria and Lebanon support the people who would be responsible. Israel would not have to directly link the countries to the attack. That is why I strongly recommend that Syria and Lebanon drop their support for terrorists otherwise they will be in a bad way when some terrorist goes too far.\n\n \n Bin laden was effectively the secretary of defense in Afghanistan. HE was a government official. The government was funding the training camps and helping to recruit and train the fighters. The government of Afghanistan owned and operated the factories that were producing the heroin that was financing Bin Ladens operations. Every member of the taliban was als a member of Al Queda, and the majority of Al Qeudas top officials held ranking positions in the Afghan government. Calling Afghanistan AlQuedastan would not have been out of line. This is hardly the case with Syria and Lebanon.\n \n \nIf it is a domestic attack then martial law would be implemented but the terrorists didn't make plutonium on their own either. Someone made it and it is possible to find out who it was. After that Israel will not stand alone in fighting whoever it was that holds responsibility for it. They will have the US and the UN. The same would be true with Mc Veigh. If Mexico had sponsored him and given him chemical weapons to use in his attack then Mexico would be in a great deal of trouble even if they didn't directly commit the attack.\n\n \n The problem you run into here is determining whether a state provided it knowingly, or was it stolen and sold ont he black market. I think the most likely scenario would be for the nuke to be from the former soviet union. After the breakup of that nation, and the domestic uprisings that followed, hundreds of nuclear weapons just vanished off the face of the earth. These were weapons that were being gaurded by soldiers who had not been paid in months and whose families were lvign off of the nuts and berries they could find in the woods. This is the kid of situation where enterprising soldiers see a stack of nukes and see a bunch of militants or black market arms dealers and see a slution to their problems. \n \n Another scenario that I think is feasable is for the nuclear materials to come from the former Iraq. We already know that after the US invaded huge amounts of nucler materials, including uranium, were scavanged from former Iraqi reacotr sites and sold as scrap. They found a bunch of it in a scrap barge in belgium. In such a case, who would israel attack in retaliation? the US for failing to secure these materials?\n \n Since israel is the only country in the ME that currently has the ability to produce weapons grade material, I think a black market type scenario is much more likely than a state sponsered one. The face of terrorism has change. It was once believed (somewhat arrogantly I might add) by most governments that a major attack would require state sponsorship. We have lately found that terrorism works better and terrorists are more effective without state sponsorship. Even the Palestenians seem to be minimising some of their ties with some of the states that have traditionally supported them in favor of a more decentralised network.\n \n \n \nIf they do not act without orders and are trained to follow orders then it is logical to say that if told to follow a shadow government that they will do so if their old government has been destroyed. Again, the nuke came from somewhere. The Palestinians didn't just make it themselves in the west bank.\n\n \n It would likely depend on who told them to follow such a government. This si the big problem with shadow governements. There is nobody to confirm their legitimacy. Personally, I think the best bet for the origins of the nuke, since none of the states in the ME are nuclear powers, is the former soviet union. \n \n \n \nBackup governments are temporary solutions to a problem. They are not going to be elected but they will stand in place of a fallen government until an election can occur. As far as the legitimacy goes, the Israelis are not a back ally operation as I have stated before. They will have a plan in place just as the US would if our government was destroyed. It will not be a mystery as to who is in charge after a catastrophic event such as this.\n\n \n Yes, but how effective do you think that plan is likely to be? Even in the US, in the event that the government is destroyed, the odds of getting a shadow governemtn up and running is zero to none. looking at coutries that HAVE experienced the collapse of their government, they seem to follow a certain power. Invariably, you end up with criminals and military tyrants in a struggle for control of the country.\n \n \nOnce again, the nuke came from somewhere. The Israelis would quickly find out where it came from and insist that the rest of the world fall in line with them in their attack of the aggressor nation. I'm not sure where you think this nuke came from. It didn't just magically appear in the hands of some terrorist and the sure as hell didn't just walk into an Israeli nuclear site and run off with one.\n\n \n Again, it would have to come from a nuclear power, and again, the most likely suspect would be russia. I donlt think Israel would be likely to attack russia, since the couter attack would be brutal and short. If israel did indeed launch a nuclear attak on russia, it would be a simple matter of Russia launching a single missile at israel. The missiles that russia has maintained are all big enough to tranform the entire nation of israel into a sheet of glass.\n \n \nOf course it has worked. It worked in Japan after WWII.\n\n \n Let me hit you with another theory on what happend \"after\" WWII in Japan. It is actually a new one to me, I just heard it a few days ago from a japanese business associate. He was around for the end of WWII, and he says that as far as most Japanese are concerned, the war never ended. They just changed the battlefield from a military one to a financial one. He claims that as far as most japanese are concerned, they are still fighting WWII, and winning. \n \n He wa explaining the structure of the Japanes corporate world (which I had studied before) and exactly why it was structured the way it is. in order to folow this, you have to understand that there are only 6 companies in japan. Everything else is a \"division of\" or a \"wholly owned subsidary of\" or some such thing. According to him, the Japanese business infrastructure was set up this way specifically in order to be able to take on America as a world power and to win. By having only six companies in Japan, they have absolute control over their entire economy. They control their overhead, the potential for foreign investment, and complete control of their government on less (far less) than democratic principals.\n \n He had a couple of examples of \"attacks\" on America that had been orchastrated by japan in the last several years. One such \"attack\" was the alleged crash of the tokyo real estate market. This was done as a result of huge American investment in the market, as well as the fact that a large amount of the market had been financed by American banks. Froma realistic standpoint, the japanese stood to loose NOTHING from this alleged crash. Since there are only 6 companies in japan, all the corporate and industrial real estate, all the banks, and all the realted firms, belong to one of these six companies. All the \"crash\" did to Japanese comapanies was to shift funds from one hand to another. They lost nothing. America, ont he other hand, lost tens of billions of dollars that those japanese companies ended up pocketing. \n \n Sorry if I drifted off topic for a minute there, I just found his explanations facinating, and was reminded of it by the reference to the Japanese. I may have to start another thread to discuss this.\n \n \n \nIsrael is far from being over run by the Palestinians. They have enough forces to go into Lebanon without a problem and take control of that country. Controlling the masses would as always prove to be difficult but Israel has far more experience in this sort of thing than the US. The US is playing softball with the Iraqi people while Israel would go right for the strong armed approach. This approach is much more effective in controlling a population.\n\n \n Yes, Hitler, Mussolini, Pol Pot, Stalin, and Soulouque all proved this quite nicely, as have many other brutal dictators during the course of history. Do we really want to align ourselves with such people, though? I realise that the Us has supposrted more than its share of these types of people (Batista, Somosa, Pahlavi, Duvalier, Pinochet, Marcos, Hussein, Noriega, and Karimov come to mind immediatly, though I could likely list a dozen more if we really need more examples). \n \n This is part of the reason we are in this mess now. i think that while corporate America is more than willing to deal with murderous thugs (as long as there is profit invloved), I think that the average man on the street is somewhat less comfortable with the idea of hundreds of thousand of people per year being killed by people that are only in power becasue we placed them there and supported them. I could be wrong. I suppose it is possible that Americans moral values have declined to the point that they are not at all bothered by the deaths of innocents in the name of corporate profit, but I doubt it.\n \n \n \nThey have not conceded that otherwise they would stop harboring terrorists who attack Israel. If I Billy Bob has the right to exist but keep helping people to try and kill him do I really seem to be standing by my words?\n\n \n Originally, the PLOs stated goal was to completely destry israel. They changed their tune as a direct result of pressure from the Arab nations. They agreed that israel does have a right to exist, just that they have to do it in their own borders. \n \n \nHow can there be normalized relations if they are under attack constantly. So lets again form Palestine and see if they act as a proper country or if they just become another Syria/Lebanon and harbor terrorists who go after Israel. Then again, lets not even waste our time. Of course they will do that. Then Israel will have to again march on Palestinian land and again the world will be up in arms about Israeli aggression. How can normalize relations even be achieved without the destruction of one side?\n\n \n I think that for several years, this may indeed be true. Israel earned their terrorism problem, just like the US earned ours. They will have to deal with them just like we will. Right now, our counter terrorism policy is similar to that of israel. You would think that we could simply look at how well their policy has worked and see that it is a loosing proposition.\n \n the problem with taking an extremist view like \"one side must be destroyed\" is that if that is the case, that side will invariably be israel. In Americas situation, demanding the destruction of one side will invariably result in the destruction of America. this is becasue terrorism is just too hard and too expensive to fight. There is no nation in the world that can afford a prolonged struggle with a well organised, multinational terrorist group. It jsut cannot be done. The ONLY way israel has managed is through billions of dollars in yearly US aid. How long do you really think they are likely to continue recieveing that aid once we start really feeling the pinch of our own spending policies here in the US?\n \n There is an interesting page at http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/book/sect5.pdf that discusses the costs of homeland security. It shows an expenditure by state, local and federal governments of roughly 100 billion per year, but points out that \"These budget allocations must be viewed as down payments to cover the most immediate security vulnerabilities\". It is further noted that these numbers do not include increased military spending for homeland security services, nro does it include private sector expendetures for homeland security (which at the bottom of the page are estimated to be up to another 55 billion per year). \n \n Just combining federal and private sector \"homeland security\" measures, you are looking at a best case sceanrio of around $155 billion per year. Figure in the military expendetures and this number easily doubles. \n \n Keep in mind that this is a \"down payment\".\n \n Israel can only hope to hold out as long as the US support does, and the US support can only be counted on as long as we can afford it. \n \n Taken in this light, it is a simple matter to understand why Israel seems on the one hand to be pressing so hard for the US to move into the ME in a big way, and on the other hand seems willing to offer some concessions to the Palestenians (such as Sharons new plan). \n \n I would think that by now Americans would have learned that fighting terrorism with your military is an expensive an futile endeavor. Just from our own recent experience, we have spend billions on military action in our \"war on terrorism\" and the result is that AQ is now 3 times as big as they were when we started and has restructred itself so theyare more difficult to find and fight. \n \n In order for israel to actually win this one, they would have to wipe out every Arab in the ME, and they just aren't that good. Even America is not that good wihtout the use of ICBM's. \n \n \n \nOh and giving into the terrorists will create less terrorists? Show me where in all of history this has worked? Why do you think the US has a policy of not dealing with terrorists? It is because this policy brings us less terrorists than dealing with them does. Give a terrorist a small piece of land and he will only want more.\n\n \n The only contemporary example of a terrorist crusade coming ot any kind of end would have to the the Irish situation. This was not ended by force, it was ended when the British finally realised that force was not going to work and they sat down at the bargaining table. \n \n Our policy of not dealing with terrorists seems logical on the surface, but doesn't seem to work. If it did, there would be no terrorists becasue we have refused to deal with them. \n \n When you are talking a relatively small number of socially maladjusted individuals, you can wipe them out and move on. When you are dealing with groups that are fairly large and well organised, Like AQ and the IRA, that enjoy no small amount of international support, you end up in a different situation. \n \n Even if you wanted to argue that the rebels in Sierra Leone were nothing but terrorists (and this has been argued), it still ended at the bargaining table. There is no questions that this will end at the bargaining table, or America will be bankrupted and essentialy destroyed int he name of \"security\", much like the former USSR was. \n \n \nMy point is that even though the Arab nations want this violence to end they cannot do anything to end it and now we can tack onto that they are not even willing to help end it because there is nothing in it for them as you have stated. How in the world do you expect that creating a Palestinian nation will end terrorist attacks from Syria and Lebanon much less other Palestinians?\n\n \n This is what they say they want, and they are legally entitled to it. Let them have it. Either you respect the law, in which case israel needs to get out of the occupied territories, or you dont. Those are really the only two options. I, for one, respect the law and would like to see it upheld.\n \n Like I said before, it may take a couple of generations for the violence to die out completely. This is just the cost israel has to pay for their actions. \n \n \n \nVery few attacks? How about no attacks is what was agreed upon. But we all know by this point that it would be impossible to stop the terrorists. Some simply don't care about the land and just want to deal pain to Israelis. These are the people who will make it impossible for peace to ever exist.\n\n \n No body can speak for an entire population. The PA and Hamas can only gaurantee that they will not back attacks. the attacks that were carried out during that time were by individuals or small spinter factions. There are going to be extremists there for most likely a generation or two that cannot be controlled. Again, if you kille a couple hundred thousand people, their relatives and family members are going to be upset with you, and sometimes do foolish things.\n \n It wasn't until Israel made it VERY clear that they had no intention of holding up their end of the bargain that attacks resumed. They were even warned several months before they resumed that unless they took some steps towards holding up their end of the arrangement the attacks would start again. \n \n you are thinking like an israeli. If one palestenian attacks, they should all be punished. This is not how civilised people do things.\n \n \nSo far we have no solutions to this problem. The UN is handcuffed, Syria and Lebanon support of terrorists makes peace through satisfying the Palestinians impossible, and Israel will not give up land for something close to peace. I think if there were a solution that ended support for terrorism in Syria and Lebanon that would be a big step forward in solving this problem. Of course all other Arab nations bordering Israel would also have to stop any behind the scenes support of terrorism as well.\n\n \n Israel had the chance for this to happen and they ****** it away. All they had to dow was withdraw from the occupied territories and the surrounding nations, including lebanon and syria, were willing to do their parts to ensure peace. Jordan was even willing to put troops into the region to ensure order until the palestenians could create a viable government of their own.\n \n It is VERY clear that israel dos not want peace. If there was peace in the region, they could not use the conflict as an excuse for the failure of their nation, nor as an excuse for needing billions in aid every year. So they keep stirring the flames. The wall they are erecting is one example of them stirring the flames. It is unlikely that, should they actually manage to keep it in one piece, it will actually do a whole lot as far as preventing terrorism goes. It was erected soley for the purpose of grabbing land and stirring the pot.\n \n Just this year they attacked and destroyed a nuclear power plant that Syria was trying to bring on line. The IAEA had already approved the design, and inspected the facility and declared it unsuitable for the production of weapons grade materials. Syria had agreed to have site inspectors from the UE at the plant. It was a power plant, nothing more. It was attacked not because of some physical threat to israel, but becasue that power plant was to provide power for a whole new industrial sector in Syria. Eu members were ready to dump billions into industrial development in Syria. Israel wanted to stop that. The US tried to stop that (with those idiotic sanctions). I noticed in the Times the other day that the EU is still going to sign the agreement in Syria. They are planning to rebuilt the power plant, but it is gonig to be jointly owned by a French, British, and German company. What is israel going to do then? Attack the french, British, and Germans? \n \n I think israels real fear is being a welfare state surrounded by profitable countries. That is the same reason they destroyed the reactor in Iraq. It had also been certified as being for power generation purposes and not suitable for creation of weapons grade materials. It was to power Iraqs industrial infrastructure into the next century. \n \n The israelis certainly couldn't stand the thought of this, so they attacked and destroyed the reactor. What will they do the next time Iraq tries to put up a reactor, this time under the control of a governemnt the US has created? \n \n With the exception of isreal (because of their policies), Saudi Arabia (because oftheir totalitarian government) and Lebanon (because of their size) the ME is considered ripe for development. They have a large workforce, skilled and with a high level of literacy and education. For industries that are petroeum based (plastics, etc...) The ME is the logical place to put their business. It gives them better process management, not to mention that witht he low cost of living in those coutries, wages can be be substantially lower than in any western nation.\n \n I think this may very well be why israel has worked so hard to undermine stability in the region. Even if Israel did go ahead and give the palestenians back their land, and even if there was immediate peace in the area, israel would still not be a good choice for investment. They basically have no resources, theri education system is not that great, and judging by how they treat non-jews (and I am not just talking Arabs here) you would have to fight racism against your employees and the parent country of the corporation throughout its life.",

Outstanding. \n \n I am not totally opposed to helping out people in other nations. We cannot do this if we spend ourselves out of existance. Every dollar that we are spending to rebuild Iraq is either staying there in the form of replacement hospitals, government buildings, houses, highways, machinery, etc... to replace what we bombed coming in, or it is going into the savigns accounts of companies like Halburton, who will most likely deposit overseas where they can get 12% on it, as opposed to the US where they get next to nothing. This is money that has effectively disapeared from our economy, though it will still be counted in the numbers that both parties like to use to convince the public that they have everything in hand.\n \n This is not like the wartime economy of old, where we saw an upsurge based on the manufature of wartime goods. Instead, money flows out, but there is no real return for America. We could have put it in a big pile and burned it for all the good it is doing us (except that actually destroying that much money might have been more benifitial from an inflationary control standpoint).",

You are right, that particular 18% of total expendatures (labor costs) will come right on back here to the US. Of course, what we will actually see back here is smaller than the 18% being allocated for labor, since a lot (up to half) of the labor associated with rebuilding Iraq will be in utilising the indigenous people. \n \n Of course, we have to keep in mind that $100,000 per year that truck driver is making is being paid for by deficit spending by the US government, which has driven the dollar way down, which is causing a cascading effect throughout the entire US economic system. this being the case, I personally have to wonder if that $100,000 is not really costing us quite a bit more than a hundred thousand bucks. \n \n Boosting federal spending and calling it economic growth is false economy. Since the federal government has no means of support besides the taxpayer, you are effectively just artificially raising the number of transactions that take place in your country, thus showing an artificially high GDP. While this is a popular trick with the number polishers, it is not really doing anything for your economy. The exception to this would be if you are deficit spending, in which case it certainly has a negative effect on the economy as you are simply borrowing from the future. \n \n I think that pretty much anybody versed in business will tell you that if you have to borrow money to make your overhead, you have screwed the pooch rather badly somewhere along the way. This is effectively what the US government is doing. \n \n In cases of non deficit spending, you are just shuffling money around. for all intents and purposes, we could all just hand off an appropriate amount of money to the guy next door, and it would have the same effect, which is to say no real effect, but it looks good on paper.\n \n I have heard people say that increased federal spending (like we see in relation to the war in Iraq) \"injects\" money into he economy. This is absolutly false. it simply shuffles it around a bit. The only way to \"inject\" money into the economy is to bring it in from outside the country. Generally this is done by maintaining a positive trade balance, though the british and romans both did it by expanding their respective empires through military conquest. In the US, we have instead ended up with a \"service based economy\". The problem with a \"service based economy\" is that no value is ever really created. Again, you are just shuffling money.",

Basically this entire debate comes down to whether you believe Israel's existence is good and right. I for one believe that regardless of how they came to be they are fighting for what is good. Their tactics to achieve these goals are not always the best but they are sometimes necessary because of threats to their way of life. These types of threats are presented to the always just as the US is beginning to see which led to our governments ill-conceived passing of the Patriot Act and taking away our freedoms. I see our government trying to do what is right in the face of a new and great challenge even though I don't like how they are going about it. Because of this I empathize with the Israeli government and understand their dilemma. I see them and the US as right in this situation, the UN as corrupt and just looking for the easiest solution rather than the right one, and the Arabs just fighting because they are angry that they are backward and have no way of getting the infidels out of the Middle East without resorting to becoming a group of terrorists. I feel sorry for the Arab nations in this aspect because they are unwilling to just be happy with what they have considering only a century ago they had no home at all. For the same reason I feel a great sense of anger at the Arabs for not realizing they found themselves fighting for a homeland not long ago and now that they have one they are trying to deny the Jews a homeland.\n \n Well there you have it, my summarized version of why I support Israel.",

Basically this entire debate comes down to whether you believe Israel's existence is good and right. I for one believe that regardless of how they came to be they are fighting for what is good. Their tactics to achieve these goals are not always the best but they are sometimes necessary because of threats to their way of life. These types of threats are presented to the always just as the US is beginning to see which led to our governments ill-conceived passing of the Patriot Act and taking away our freedoms. I see our government trying to do what is right in the face of a new and great challenge even though I don't like how they are going about it. Because of this I empathize with the Israeli government and understand their dilemma. I see them and the US as right in this situation, the UN as corrupt and just looking for the easiest solution rather than the right one, and the Arabs just fighting because they are angry that they are backward and have no way of getting the infidels out of the Middle East without resorting to becoming a group of terrorists. I feel sorry for the Arab nations in this aspect because they are unwilling to just be happy with what they have considering only a century ago they had no home at all. For the same reason I feel a great sense of anger at the Arabs for not realizing they found themselves fighting for a homeland not long ago and now that they have one they are trying to deny the Jews a homeland.\n \n Well there you have it, my summarized version of why I support Israel.\n\n \n \n I don't blame you for not wanting to continue, and am happy to agree to disagree with you on this one. It seems to be a never ending debate, both sides have good points and I think you are correct that it basically comes down to a matter of percetion.\n \n My summarized view is as follows:\n \n Israel once had the right to exist, and still may, or they may have forefeited their right to exist by their actions (I am still undecided on this).\n \n I do not believe in the saying \"the ends justify the means\" in most cases. I almost never buy into it when it involves the deaths of hundreds of thousnads of people.\n \n I may be a little idealistic on this point, but I have always believed that if you treat people fairly and justly, they will respond in kind. i honestly believe that if the israelis had allowed the palestenians to stay in their homes as citizens of the new israel, with all the rights and privelages that go with that designation, there would not have been the years of bloodshed and violence. I also believe that, had they done this, israel could have become a powerhouse in the ME. Instead, they have become a welfare state dependant entirely on foreign charity for survival.",

   "Oddly enough, whilst you argue pro-Islamic arguments on the basis that there are some good Muslims, you want to condemn all Israelis on the basis of the actions of their government.\n\n \n No, unlike some here (yes, I am talking about you) I am not a racist. I would condem the state of isreal based on the actions of their democratically elected government. I would also suggest that those in the government who have participated in war crimes (such as sharon) be tried for those crimes. \n \n I find it distasteful to hold an entire race, or the population of an entire country, responsible for the actions of a few. \n \n \n \nYet you support the PLO when it attacks Israel, but no other 'occupiers of Palestine'; Syria, the Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\n\n \n I don't neccessarily support widespread palestenian agression in this matter either. My main beef wqith israel is the way they have treated the palestenians. If these other countries had singled out the palestenains and treated them as second class citizens, I would have a beef with them as well, and would support their downfall. Who is occupying palestine has little weight with me. It is the actions of those people towards the palestenian people that matter. Turning an entire segment of your popualtion into second class citizens is wrong.\n \n \nSo, because a nation is dependant on foreign aid, it looses it's right to exist? Fair enough. I'd like to see that rule applied to all of Africa. Hey, what about those foreign workers and troops aiding Saudi Arabia. Naw! You're not going to ignore them are you. I bet you do.\n\n \n No, I think that by such actions as state sponsored ethnic cleansing it could very well be argued that a state looses its right to exist. I believe this is especially true in the case of democratic nations, whose elected leaders carry out such barbaric acts. \n \n Foreign aid really has nothing to do with, it only highlights how low israel has sunk, considering the potential that they had to start.\n \n \nFurther, the Palestinians didn't want to be part of Israel - hence many fled to Jordan.\n\n \n I am not especially concerned about the palestenains who fled, more with the ones who either stayed or were forced out.

Since there is no way, short of going back to see exactly who voted for the ethnic cleansing crowd, to find out exactly who is responsible, the responsibility must lie squarely on the shoulder of the government.\n \n \nYou'll condemn a government to non-existence, if they accept foreign aid, so long as it's Israel\n\n \n see above, and this isn't what I said.\n \n \nYou'll condemn a people using violence to defend themselves, so long as it's Israel \n \n \n I will condem any government using their troops to kill civilians, any nation that strives to create a second class citizern based on ethnicity, and any nation that forcibly expells individuals based on their race. iw ill further condem any nation that strives for ethnic purity. These are not nobel goals, these are the goals of tyrtants and madmen, and they should be treated as such. \n \n If you are talking about a people using violence in pure self defense, in the pursuit of freedom, or against an unjust and tyranical government, that is a noble thing, and such people have my unfettered support.\n \n \nor; that as long as it's anti-Israelii, you'll support it.\n\n \n I have found it typical among racists to paint other people perceptions in their own terms.

I could care less whether you are a Jew, Arab, American, Australian, Bushman, whatever. As far as I am concernedm, there are certina ways you treat people becasue they are human beings.

The biggest argument against gun control seems to be that we have certain rights, not granted by our government but simply basic, human rights endowed my our creator. The biggest argument by the Anti gunners seems to be crime. The counter to this is that we do NOT punish everybody for the crimes of a few.\n \n Do not the palestenians deserve these same basic rights? Why is it right for US gun owners to keep our guns based on the argument that to punish the innocent right along with the guilty is tyranical, but when dealing with the palestenains this is acceptable?\n \n Don't you believe in our constitution, that recognises that human beings have rights from the first breath they draw until the very last? Why would these same basic rights not apply to every human being?\n \n Aren't you an American? Start acting like one.",

I would also agree that the responsibility of ths ultimatly lies ont eh people of America, and any ill effects of this policy will eventually be born on the shoulders of those people. \n \n \nWhich is exactly what you've just done!\n\n \n No, its not. Do you really need clarification on this?\n \n \nAll of your criticism to date has been upon Israel.

It is not. Whiel the land dispute is there, and very real, it is a question of human rights, not merely land.\n \n \nAre you American? See acts of your nation.\n\n \n I know. Pretty bad. Believe me, I am doing all I can to change the acts of my nation. I will not whine when we are attacked by terrorists, nor will I act indignant and try to blame the rest of the world when we get our come uppins. There is a better than average chance that our economy will collapse due to the pressure put on it of late, and part of that is because of our poor foreign policy. \n \n If I could pull of a coup tommorow and fix what is wrong with America, believe me, I would.\n \n Perhaps you could give me a recent (last 100 years would be good I suppose) of the US commiting genocide, or participating in ethnic cleansing.\n \n \n \nYou just contradict yourself here.

It is called \"context\" my friend.\n \n \n \nHuh? You are contradicting yourself again.\n\n \n No, I am not. I am not concerned with palestenians in Jordan, Egypt, Syria or Lebanon. I am concerned with the palestenians who are currently under israels control. While I recognise that many of those under israels control initially fled israel, then came back under israels control under the illegal occupation, those are still the folks I am primarily concerned with. Lets not split hairs here.\n \n \nEnd of issue then. The Palestinians don't have a proper claim under international law to Israel.\n\n \n Except to the occupied territories, which the UN has declared israel is to vacate on several occasions, no, they do not have a proper claim. \n \n \n \nThat's not true. You said that the people of Israel don't have a right to have their own country; Israel - which has no right to exist.\n\n \n \"Israel\" is a nation controlled by a gaovernment. When I say israel may not have a right to exist, I mean exactly that, the state of israel may not have the right to exist. I do not mean we should kill every israeli.\n \n Not everybody in the world has a right to their own country. The kurds do not have their own nation. I know of some groups of anti government nuts who would LOVE to have their own country. They don't get one. There are times that I wish I had MY own country. I cannot have one.\n \n If, in fact, israel does have to exist, I think proper punishment for their government may be similar to that of post WWII germany, completely clean house and start over again. \n \n \n \nI'm afraid it is. One of your main attacks on Israel is that they use foreign aid. See above where you say first this means nothing, then it does mean something.\n\n \n No, it is not, you are trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. Israels foreign aid is not at all pivitol to this argument. If we were suggesting US aid to israel, it would indeed be a point worth discussing, as in whether it is good policy to subsidise another country that has no realistic chance of survival outside of that subsidation. \n \n This is not what we are discussing here. \n \n \nThe you condemn every government.\n\n \n Yes, I do, at least while it is going on.\n \n \nWhy ethnicity? Why not on any basis?\n\n \n Because valid reasons for the creation of a second class group of citizens does exist. For example, convicted felons in the US for all intents and purposes become second class citizens. They loose rights that the rest of us enjoy, such as the right to bear arms and the right to vote. \n \n People in jail or prison effectively are second class citizens as well. They have no rights, though we don't just kill them. Their rights are restored once they leave prison, of course (except in the case of felons), but while they are in jail they are undoubtedly second class citizens, as they do not enjoy the rights and privelages of everybody else.\n \n \n \nIslamic states created second class citizens and called them 'dhimmi'\n\n \n Some islamic states in the ME have done this, most notably Iran and Saudi Arabia. What is your point? We are not talking about Saudi Arabia or Iran here, were are talking about israel and Palestenians. Does the fact that Saudi Arbia did it make it right for israel to do the same? Or is that simply a sign that there are problems in Saudi Arabia as well? Does the fact that Hitler killed a bunch of jews mean that every nation has the right to do it? i think not.\n \n Since you brought it up, I am all for the US ending our relationship with Saudi Arabia and supporting an overthrow of the house of Saud. \n \n \n \nI thought you said Israel was a democracy? Now they're tyrants, so ipso facto, you can't hold all Israelis in contempt.\n\n \n Israel is a democracy, this does not preclude them from having a bunch of tyrants in charge, it just means that they elected the tyrants, ans continue to do so. \n \n A definition of Tyrant:\n \n 1. An absolute ruler who governs without restrictions. \n 2. A ruler who exercises power in a harsh, cruel manner. \n 3. An oppressive, harsh, arbitrary person. \n \n Also, what I said was:\n \n \nand any nation that forcibly expels individuals based on their race. iw ill further condemn any nation that strives for ethnic purity. These are not noble goals, these are the goals of tyrants and madmen, and they should be treated as such. \n \n \n \n Those are the goals of tyrants and madmen.\n \n Also, I think I have made it clear at least a dozen times that I do not hold all israelis in contempt. You are the racist here, remember?\n \n \n \nSo Israel is justified then. They are fighting against a people who believe that Israel shouldn't exist.\n\n \n Not even going to justify this one with a comment\n \n \n \nI was particularly provocative towards Arabs. I admitted such, and I said it was done in irony to reflect on your own rabid statements about Israel. One of your attacks on Israel was that they are operating only because of the US. And you completely ignored that Kuwait only exists today because of the US (and allies; including Australia)\n \n You on the other hand offer no proof of insightfulness into your own attacks on Israel which are spewn out with a venom I seldom see.\n\n \n Venom? Come on..... give me a break, this is patheitic. I don't care WHY you are racist. Israel is only able to operate because of US aid. This is not a debatable point, it is fact. Even israeli officials do not deny this. \n \n Kuwait, on the other hand, is a rich little nation on its own. The two are not comparable.\n \n Exactly what \"proof of insightfullness\" are you looking for? I am a simple man, i see somebody doing something wrong, I say \"they are doing something wrong\". It is not particularly insightful.\n \n \n \nAustralians aren't a 'race'. In fact, Marxists would have you believe that there's no such thing.\n\n \n Sorry, I used \"racism\" for lack of a better word. I am not exactly what you would call hating a group of folks based on their nationality. \n \n \n \nWhy not? The US is a democracy.\n\n \n As I said before, the citizens of the US will eventually bear the punishment for the actions of our government collectively, as do the citizens of any nation whose government commits crimes or attrocities. Direct punisment is reserved for those directly responsible for these acts. This is why Saddam Hussein is sitting in a prison and is going to be tried, but not every Iraqi citizen is sitting in a prison waiting to be tried. While the citizens of Iraq do bear some collective responsibility for his actions (since they outnumbered him millions to one), they will not be individually held responsible for each of those actions.\n \n \nGood I'm glad you cleared that up! By the way, when you say that there are certain ways we should treat people what is the fundamental principle underlying this?\n\n \n Good ald fashioned midwestern morals for one. Tehy are based on christin principals. The principals of American democracy for another, which is founded on the theory that all people have rights, they have them from the day they are born until the day they die",

   "No, you said Israel has no right to exist. You would make everyone in Israel punished... by taking away their right to have a nation. You say this by supporting an organisation that wants Israel to cease to exist*\n\n \n No, I said this was a question worth examining. I believe I also stated that a claeaning house, similar to what we did in germany following WWII might be more in order for israel. \n \n I also pointed out that this absurd \"right to have a nation\" does not exist. it never has, it never will. I don't have my own nation, nor do the Kurds, nor do you. There is no \"right to have a nation\". Some groups have gotten lucky and end up witht heir own nation, some do not. I realise that by doing such a house cleaning and granting everybody in the areas primarily controlled by israel, the Jews would loose control of the country and be forced to live with other ethnic groups. This is just too bad. This is the way the rest of the world is, they will adjust.\n \n \nFurther to that, through your own absurd guilt-by-association argument, you are guilty too, because as an American, you are now implicitly guilty of your own nation's policies against the Palestinians.\n\n \n It is not simply a matter of guilt by association. In any democratic republic, the power is ultimatly weilded by the people, and they are ultimatly responsible for how that power is used. \n \n \nRegardless of what you do you are still guilty, as you make the people of Israel (becuase you stressed Israel being a democracy, implying that the governemnt's actions are of the people, and for the people).\n\n \n Again, while each individual may not bear full responsibility for the actions of a democratically elected government, the people at large do. In the case of somebody who is elected adn in a single term of office does something totally outrageous, the responsibility os not that great. When you are talking about a citizenry that consisitently elects people who advocate things like ethnic cleansing and murder of civilians, the responsibility is much greater, as at eevry election they had the chance to change the leadership of their nation.\n \n I realise that some people prefer not to take responsibility for things, but one of the prices of a democracy is shared responsibiltiy in the actions of your government.\n \n \n \nThen why bring it up? It's like saying \"Hey man, are you a homosexual? It doesn't really matter to me, but I'd just like to know\"\n\n \n It did have meaning in context. You have a real problem with that context thing, don't you?\n \n \nIf it has no meaning then don't bring it up.

One example is you saying this: \"If after WWII, we had left Hitler in control of GErmany and had not required reform from Germanys government, people would have been most unhappy. Proportionatly, Hitler killed fewer jews than the Israelis have palestenians.\"\n To make that statement true, Israel would have to kill at least 3 million Palestinians over the last 100 years (proportionatly speaking). From the most pro-Palestinian sources I know of they claim Israel had killed 200,000 Palestinians. Even that number includes death of Palestinians by their own brethren. Moreover, the Nazis have killed 6 million Jews in only about 6 years, whereas the Israeli-Arab conflict has been going on for 100 years. Your example is totally \"messed up\".

I believe israel belongs to the israelis, whether they are jews, palestenians, egyptians, etc... \n\n Israel belongs to Egyptians? Israelis who are Palestinians? Please clarify yourself better on that point.\n \n \nI do not know thta israel came to exist wrongfully, the question was, have they lost their right to exist due to their policies. I beleive they have lost the right to exist as they are now because of their ethic cleansing policies and their oppression of an entire group of their population.\n\n *Isn't the ethnic cleansing which you talk about the 1948 Palestinian refugees? That happened with Israel's formation as a state. That would mean you do have a problem with her right to exist.\n *Entire group of whose population? Palestinians were never a part of Israel's population.\n \nThis does not mean I think the state of israel should be disolved and all the israelis driven into the sea. I simply think they need major reforms.\n\n By saying Israel lost her right to exist you do mean driving Israelis to the seas. It cannot mean anything else. Other wise you're just contradicting yourself. It is also hypocritic of you to say that. That would mean, a people or nation which do wrong things would lose their right to exist as well.

That's exactly what happened in 1948. The Arabs which were inside Israel's boarders recieved full Israeli citizenship. In contrast, the Palestinian Arabs which were annexd to Jordan and Egypt never recieved citizenship of their countries. Instead Jordan and Egypt (with Lebanon and Syria) built refugee camps and used them in the struggle to bring destruction to Israel.\n \n Maybe if six million Jews hadn't died in the holocaust they could have lived in Israel today to make a solid Jewish majority and the Palestinians in the WB and Gaza Strip would recieve Israeli citizenship (of course, only when they stop violence and accept Israel's existence). Even though I think that is a good solution it cannot happen due to the Palestinian increased population which will outnumber Israeli Jews and bring an end to the Jewish state.

You believe so highly in the UN which is what I'm sure you will use as the basis for your argument that Israeli is illegally occupying territory but your belief in the UN goes only so far. If Israel is illegally occupying territory then that also means the US is illegally allowing them to. That is absolutely false. The US is legally preventing the UN from claiming that Israel is illegally occupying territory. That means that the land Israel has now is theirs in the eyes of UN law hence the reason Israel is able to continue to hold this land. You may think it is unfair that the US is holding this sort of position but that isn't the point. The point is that Israel is NOT ILLEGALLY OCCUPYING TERRITORY.\n \n \nI know about the palestenian \"atrocities\" (murders, definatly....atrocities, come on, they just haven't killed enough to earn that title).

Does that make Russia wrong or are the Chechens terrorists and bringing these attacks upon themselves? How about the US v al Queda and our actions against Afghanistan? Kill ratio supports the US. Are we the bad guys or did the terrorists bring this upon themselves? In either case do you consider the Chechen or al Queda roles as actually committing the worse atrocity even though they had more killed in retaliation? I certainly would in the case of al Queda. Kill ratio does not justify who is actually commiting the worse atrocities and who is just getting what they deserve.\n \n \nThere is no international body or international law that allows the international community to deal with the acts of individuals or non government entitites. The palestenian terror groups are non government entitites, therefore outside of any type of control of the international community.\n\n \n Funny, the UN seemed willing to side with the US in attacking a country who harbored the people who launched the 9/11 attacks. They essentially pledged to join in the war on terror as well. Now here we have terrorist groups being knowingly harbored in countries like Lebanon and Syria who are attacking Israel. I don't think it is a far stretch to say that the UN has agreed to hold countries responsible for the actions taken by terrorists they willingly harbor.\n \n \nThat's becasue you are a racist. You dislike arabs. I dislike the real estate and humanitarian policies of the state of israel. There is a HUGE difference.\n\n \n I came into this debate not knowing you at all and have also come to the conclusion that you are racist against the Jews. I'm not surprised that others have as well. Your claims are extreme and often times you ignore the wrongs of those who oppose the Jews while strictly blaming the Jews for everything. You also wish to go beyond what you would call UN law and take away all of Israel from the Jews.

Israel signed up to th Geneva Convention and it's occupation violates that. It is an illegal occupation of land gained through war.\n \n \nRussia has about the same kill ratio for their war on Chechnya. Does that make Russia wrong...\nOf course it does and most of the world, including the USA pre \"9/11\" condemned Russia's actions in Chechnya. It suits Putin and Bush at the moment to view each other as partners in the \"fight on terrorism\" and so the USA turns a blind eye to Russian attrocities in Chechnya.\n \n \nI came into this debate not knowing you at all and have also come to the conclusion that you are racist against the Jews...\nI haven't read the whole of this thread, so may have missed racist comments by daewoo.

Sure the USA's behaviour toward Israel is utterly irresponsible and counter-productive as it hamstrings the UN and allows Israel to ignore UN resolutions against it, but such behaviour isn't illegal.\n\n \n It doesn't follow and that is my point.\n \n \nJust because the USA is preventing the correct functioning of the UN in this matter doesn't change the fact that Israel's occupation of the \"uccupied territories\" is itself illegal. Israel signed up to th Geneva Convention and it's occupation violates that. It is an illegal occupation of land gained through war.\n\n \n And who backs the Geneva Convention? Per part 1 of this debate you can see that the UN is not able to label this illegal.\n \n \nOf course it does and most of the world, including the USA pre \"9/11\" condemned Russia's actions in Chechnya. It suits Putin and Bush at the moment to view each other as partners in the \"fight on terrorism\" and so the USA turns a blind eye to Russian attrocities in Chechnya.\n\n \n I would tend to agree with you here and I'm glad you brought it up while not attacking the al Queda part of the debate. It goes to show that kill ratio tells us little and to try and justify your argument just based on that is not going to work.\n \n \nI haven't read the whole of this thread, so may have missed racist comments by daewoo. I suspect I am safe in assuming you are confusing Israel with Jewish people. Expressing ones utter disgust at the behaviour of Israel is not anti semetic.\n\n \n Personally I believe he is Anti-Semetic based on his almost nonsensical reasons for wanting to eliminate Israel. He wants to uphold UN law but all the while he wants to eliminate the entire country. He holds them responsible for their bad actions but is not going to hold their enemies responsible. Either he is irrational and misunderstands what this whole conflict is actually about or he has a deep hatred for the Jews. That hatred would go to explain a lot about his reasoning for hating Israel while just hating Israel would leave a lot to be explained as to why he holds the position he does. But that is just my opinion.",

   "Based on what? You believe so highly in the UN which is what I'm sure you will use as the basis for your argument that Israeli is illegally occupying territory but your belief in the UN goes only so far. If Israel is illegally occupying territory then that also means the US is illegally allowing them to. That is absolutely false. The US is legally preventing the UN from claiming that Israel is illegally occupying territory. That means that the land Israel has now is theirs in the eyes of UN law hence the reason Israel is able to continue to hold this land. You may think it is unfair that the US is holding this sort of position but that isn't the point. The point is that Israel is NOT ILLEGALLY OCCUPYING TERRITORY.\n\n \n They are illegally occupying forign territory gained during war. The US is absolutly aiding them in this endeavor, which is wrong, but there is no international law dealing with \"aiding and abbetting\". It doesn't matter whether the UN declares them in violation of that law or not, theya re still guilty of breaking it. The UN does not generally declare nations in violation of the law, the security council justs passes a resolution to handle the situation. The fact that the US has blocked them from doing so does not mean israels actions are not illegal.\n \n \n \n \nRussia has about the same kill ratio for their war on Chechnya. Does that make Russia wrong or are the Chechens terrorists and bringing these attacks upon themselves? How about the US v al Queda and our actions against Afghanistan? Kill ratio supports the US. Are we the bad guys or did the terrorists bring this upon themselves? In either case do you consider the Chechen or al Queda roles as actually committing the worse atrocity even though they had more killed in retaliation? I certainly would in the case of al Queda. Kill ratio does not justify who is actually commiting the worse atrocities and who is just getting what they deserve.\n\n \n Before the war in Iraq, when we found it convenient to play buddy buddy with the russians, there was quite a bit of pressure on them regarding the situation in Chechnya. There was even some pretty serious talk about sending peackeepers into the region. We (the US) are turning a blind eye to the situation there as long as it is convenient for us to do so.\n \n In Afghanistan, you had a situation where the terrorists wer not only hiding in the country, they werde leading the country. BL was the head of their military, and all other AQ leaders in Afghanistan also held ranking positions in the government. The two (AQ and the afghan government) were so intertwined it would have been difficult to distinguish the two. They could have named the country Alquedastan.\n \n I will agree that the problem of civilain casualties in the united states \"war on terror\" is a serious problem that should be examined.\n \n You are using faulty logic, though. Two wrongs do not make a right, and the fact that russia has similar casualty figures does not mean it is OK for israel, it just means they are both wrong.\n \n \n \nFunny, the UN seemed willing to side with the US in attacking a country who harbored the people who launched the 9/11 attacks. They essentially pledged to join in the war on terror as well. Now here we have terrorist groups being knowingly harbored in countries like Lebanon and Syria who are attacking Israel. I don't think it is a far stretch to say that the UN has agreed to hold countries responsible for the actions taken by terrorists they willingly harbor.\n\n \n The problem with this is that the palestenians meet every definition of \"freedom fighter\". \n \n As far as the UN holding countries responsible for the actions of terrorists they willinglt harbor, that is a tough one (though entirely wrong). The UN has always held states that actively sponser terrorism responsible for the acts commited by those terrorists. This was based on the logic that the state was sponsering and controlling the terrorists, so their activities were basically extensions of the state will. This was the case in afghanistan, wehre the terrorists were not only hiding out, they were runnign the place.\n \n Nations have gotten the picture that state sponsered terrorism is a bad idea, and terrorists have moved away from seeking state sponsors (which is kind of too bad because there was some control over them then, now there is none). \n \n \n \nI came into this debate not knowing you at all and have also come to the conclusion that you are racist against the Jews. I'm not surprised that others have as well. Your claims are extreme and often times you ignore the wrongs of those who oppose the Jews while strictly blaming the Jews for everything. You also wish to go beyond what you would call UN law and take away all of Israel from the Jews. Your hatred for them is apparent and I certainly don't think you are in a position to call someone else a racist\n\n \n SSHHHH....dont tell my wife or my daughter. My wife is jewish and my daughter, by default, is half jewish. This is a little factiod I keep in reserve to use when people who cannot differentiate between disapproval of a nations policies and disapproval of an entire race of people.\n \n Of course, maybe she is racist. I have heard her make the same arguments regarding israel a hundred times. I also have a brother in law that is jewish, and he spends quite a bit of time arguing against israel (of course, his is a religous argument, namely that all israeli jews are going to burn in hell for supporting the zionist state which, according to him, they are prohibited from having in the torah).

   "But legally they are allowed to stay on that land right now. How can it be illegal for them to do so and legal for them to do so at the same time?\n\n \n No, they are NOT legally allowed to stay on that land right now. I assume you are talking about the \"road map\". that is what we are doing INSTEAD of the legal remedy, whcih would be to demand the immediate and unconditional removal of their troops (like we did in Kuwait). \n \n The fact that the roadmap os being supported by the US does not mean it entirely legal. The Us is operating entirely outside of the law on this thing. From a legal standpoint, israel should be required to immediatly and onconditionally remove all troops and pay for the rebuilding of the occupied territories to pre-occupation status. They would also be required to oay reperations to the palestenians for homes that were destroyed, destruction of agricultural commodiites (such as the olive groves) and turn ove any israeli military personel that are guilty of war crimes.\n \n This is what would be legal. \n \n \n \n \nYes they were two different situations, each of which we are unable to determine who is right based on a body count. The same is true of Israel and Palestine.\n\n \n Correct, you cannot always decide who is right based on body count. So, instead lets look at who is in flagrant violation if international law. Wait, that would still be israel. Maybe if we just went by civilian body count. No, israel is still in the wrong.\n \n \nI'm not trying to justify Israel killing civilians or Russia or Palestine or the US or al Queda. I'm not trying to justify a wrong by using another wrong as an example. What I'm getting at here is that you were wrong to state \"As a matter of scale, the israeli deaths are barely worthy of mention\". As a matter of scale the 9/11 attacks were barely worth mention either but that doesn't stop you from supporting US actions against Alquedastan in response to it.\n\n \n \n No, the numbers are not so far off in the \"war on terror (once you discount the fact that the Iraq war has nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism). The American civilian bodyt count has been rougly 3000. In order for it to be of a similar scale, we would have to see at least 90,000 civilian deaths in afghanistan. The highest realistic estimates of civilain deaths in afghanistan are under 6000. If we figure that 6000 is a correct number (the number is likely closer to 5000), then we hve outkilled the terrorists 2 to 1 when it comes to civilians.\n \n By contrast, the israelis have outkilled the palestenians by more than 33-1. only about 3% of the total casualties in the conflict have been israeli casualties. Statistically, 3% would generally be considered insignificant. \n \n It could also be effectively argued that there is a difference between collateral damage during a military invasion and intentional slaughter of unarmed civilians, like what went on after the invasion of lebanon, and what the israelis have done so many times in the refuge camps.\n \n \nFreedom fighter is a very loose term.\n \n WEBSTER DICTIONARY: \"a person who takes part in an armed rebellion against the constituted authority\"\n\n \n \"freedom fighter\" also has a legal definition, whihc is the one that matters in this case.\n \n \nSo if I grabbed a gun right now and shot a police officer I would be a freedom fighter. Now how the coward Palestinians attacking civilians constitutes them as freedom fighters, I'm not sure but no doubt you can find a way to make them fall in that very wide category.\n\n \n No, becasue in a court, the legal definition of \"freedom fighter\" would come into play. \n \n They are fighting a guerilla war against an illegally occupying force. Guerilla warfare is often unpleasant and almost always results in civilian casualties and loss of civilain property. \n \n Do you remember the boston tea party? That tea was not owned by the british government. It was owned by civilains. This is the way you fight a guerilla war. That is one of the reasons that guerilla warfare has proven so effective. You have to be really hard headed to wade into a mess like that and keep up the battle.\n \n \n \nIt is not entirely wrong. It works on the same principle as being an associate to a crime. \n \n \n Thre is no provision for this in international law\n \n \nEvery society has laws against what these terrorist harboring states are doing. \n\n \n Laws that only apply within their borders. In dealing with disputes between nations, these laws do not apply.\n \n \nThe UN supported action against the Taliban in Afghanistan, not against al Queda. Al Queda was paying the Taliban for use of their country. The Taliban were the associates to the 9/11 attacks and many other terrorist attacks committed by al Queda. \n \n \n The UN supported action against Afghanistan because AQ and the Taliban were so closely interconnected. It was not just a question of state sponsored terrorism, or even harboring terrorists. It was a question of terrorists and AQ members actually running the country.\n \n \nThose are the people the UN was targeting and all the Alquedastaning in the world isn't going to change the fact that the Taliban didn't ocrestrate 9/11, their terrorists did and they allowed it. \n \n \n Yes, taliban members DID orchastrate 9/11. Bin Laden was a member of the taliban. \n \n \nAlso if the UN had really declared war on al Queda then they would also be in Pakistan right now fighting to find Bin Laden.\n\n \n The UN does not have the power to declare war first off. Second, the government in Pakistan is distinguishable from Al Queda, unlike that of Afghanistan. The taliban soldiers were being trained in AQ camps, and AQ officers were commanding them in the field. The two were completely indistinguishable. It would have been impossible to go after one without going after the other. They were too closely interconnected.\n \n \n \nThe up side to it is that they have to spend more time and money trying to stay under the radar as every country is now looking for them. They have no friends anywhere.\n\n \n Pre 9/11, AQ had an estimated membership worldwide of around 3000. Now, it is estimated to be in excess of 8000 (though some estimates put it as high as 12,000). Their funding pre-9/11 was estimated at around $9,000,000 per year, now it is estimated to be in excess of $290,000,000 per year. \n \n They don;t seem to have any problem with finding friends or recruiting members. If anything, breaking ties with individual states has greatly benifitted terrorists by freeing them from the stigma that comes with being attached to certain countries (syria, iran, etc...). Now, those who hate America, but also do not want to be associated with totalitarian regimes like of Iran have a home.\n \n \nThen explain why you seem so supportive of law and order yet still wish for Israel to be totally eliminated. It goes against your principles and what you are ultimately trying to achieve. There has to be a very strong reason behind this more so than the simple fact that they are fighting a war that you don't approve of. Even the allies didn't approve of Germany after two world wars that threatened their very existance and way of life yet they let Germany remain.\n\n \n I have no wish for the total elimination of israel. I wish for the government of israel to be destroyed completely, and a new on put in its place. A complete restructuring is in order. They have too many war criminals making too many decisions. It is a time for a change. Maybe you mean my wish for the destruction of an ethnically pure israel? \n \n \nI argue against the US all the time and I'm an American. It is natural for people to try and find the things they wish to fix about their country in order to find ways to improve it and be more proud of it. But have they ever wished for it to cease to exist and be given to the same terrorists who are fighting them now? If so then they also have a very strong reason behind their beliefs.\n\n \n this is simply a matter of right. People should have the right to vote. If that means that the palestenian arabs run the country of israel (beacuse there are more of them) then so be it. If this means that jews run israel because there are more of them, then that is fine, too. If this means that you don't allow a large percentage of your population to vote because you wish for an ethnic minority to remain in power, you are no better than hitler. If israel wants to hold on to the occupied territories, I have no problem with that, so long as they give all the people in those territories citizenship and all the rights that come with it. It would still be illegal, but ther wouldn;t be nearly as much protsest over it, since the arabs would then hold enough votes to make some serious changes.\n \n What isreal wants to do is hold onto the territories, but keep the population as \"un-people).

   "No, they are NOT legally allowed to stay on that land right now. I assume you are talking about the \"road map\". that is what we are doing INSTEAD of the legal remedy, whcih would be to demand the immediate and unconditional removal of their troops (like we did in Kuwait). \n\n \n But we are not legally required to do so. Therefore we can legally make it legal for Israel to continue to hold this land. So how exactly can they be their illegally???\n \n \nThe fact that the roadmap os being supported by the US does not mean it entirely legal. The Us is operating entirely outside of the law on this thing.\n\n \n Point me over to the law we are breaking and I'll point you over to the rule that states that we can work our way around that law. We are doing nothing illegal and we are operating entirely within the law. Clinton was able to free hardened criminals in his last day of presidency. Was it unlawful to do so? If I did it then it would be unlawful. But he has the power to work his way around the laws legally. Therefore what the president did was legal. Same with the UN/US/Israel situation. If Israel just took those lands and the UN security council all voted to support UN law and declare Israel's occupation as illegal, then it would be illegal. However the US has the power to work around this rule therefore making it legal for Israel to hold this land without anyone being outside the law.\n \n \nThis is what would be legal. \n\n \n Yes it would be legal but there are many other things that are possible legal solutions as well, one of which is the US using its power to legally allow Israel to maintain control over these lands.\n \n \nBy contrast, the israelis have outkilled the palestenians by more than 33-1. only about 3% of the total casualties in the conflict have been israeli casualties. Statistically, 3% would generally be considered insignificant. \n\n \n And the Europeans out killed the Indians by a greater margin than that. Should we just pack up and leave the entire continent because of it? Again, body count has nothing to do with it. For instance if the US were attacked by a foreign nation the way Israel is being attacked by Palestinians, I would fully support the US out killing our enemies 33 to 1. If my nation is at risk then do whatever it takes to defend ourselves. That is why I empathize with Israel. They are on the defensive as people like you wish to see them completely destroyed and they have ONE FREAKING ALLY AGAINST THE ENTIRE WORLD. I'm glad we are the ones who stand up for Israel and I'm just as glad that Israel is willing to stand up for themselves against these terrorists. The rest of the world can just sit back and call the Israelis the aggressors but they are not the ones who have to be afraid to ride a bus for fear that it will be blown up or keep a close eye on every one of their borders for fear of a massive and coordinated surprise attack at any given moment. I know of no other country in history that has had to deal with what Israel is dealing with today. If it were America or Russia or France that had to deal with this type of situation year after year, decade after decade, and they were the only ones capable of nuclear attacks against their enemies, you can be sure they would have all gone that route. I applaud Israel for showing restraint and not having a 900-1 kill ratio at this point.\n \n \nIt could also be effectively argued that there is a difference between collateral damage during a military invasion and intentional slaughter of unarmed civilians, like what went on after the invasion of lebanon, and what the israelis have done so many times in the refuge camps.\n\n \n Gee, intentional slaughter of unarmed civilians. Lets see here...who else do I remember doing that? Oh yeah, the Palestinians! In fact their main form of military strategy revolves around this practice. And yet you support them. Go figure.\n \n \nDo you remember the boston tea party? That tea was not owned by the british government. It was owned by civilains. This is the way you fight a guerilla war. That is one of the reasons that guerilla warfare has proven so effective. You have to be really hard headed to wade into a mess like that and keep up the battle.\n\n \n Define illegal occupying force then. How were the British the illegal occupying force at that time? They founded the country. How could they not legally be the rightful owners of it?\n \n \nThe UN supported action against Afghanistan because AQ and the Taliban were so closely interconnected. It was not just a question of state sponsored terrorism, or even harboring terrorists. It was a question of terrorists and AQ members actually running the country.\n\n \n Closely interconnected but who did they actually go to war with? Of course it was the people who were harboring the terrorists and not the terrorists themselves.\n \n \nYes, taliban members DID orchastrate 9/11. Bin Laden was a member of the taliban.\n\n \n I'm a part of the United States. I bought this computer. Did the United States orchestrate my buying this computer? Bin Laden was part of the Taliban but that doesn't mean the Taliban are directly responsible for orchestrating anything that he did and they did not. Bin Laden was given support by the Taliban to make terrorist attacks such as the one on 9/11 just as the US has supported me with a working economy in which to make money to buy this computer. They are not directly related. Therefore the UN waged a war on an associate to terrorism.\n \n \nThe UN does not have the power to declare war first off. Second, the government in Pakistan is distinguishable from Al Queda, unlike that of Afghanistan. The taliban soldiers were being trained in AQ camps, and AQ officers were commanding them in the field. The two were completely indistinguishable. It would have been impossible to go after one without going after the other. They were too closely interconnected.\n\n \n OK the UN cannot declare war but their member can. While I was unspecific about this I'm sure you understood what I meant. Anyways al Queda lives on while the Taliban is gone. That is because the member of the UN decided to focus on something manageable such as the country of Afghanistan and the government that was an associate to the 9/11 attack. It would be far too difficult to wage war with an organization like al Queda because they exist in too many countries such as Pakistan. Don't think for a moment either that there are not training camps in Pakistan.\n \n \nThey don;t seem to have any problem with finding friends or recruiting members. If anything, breaking ties with individual states has greatly benifitted terrorists by freeing them from the stigma that comes with being attached to certain countries (syria, iran, etc...). Now, those who hate America, but also do not want to be associated with totalitarian regimes like of Iran have a home.\n\n \n Pre 9/11 they were able to coordinate the second largest attack against the US in our history. Since then they haven't been able to do anything significant even with more members, more money, and more support. They need all these things just to try and break even with what they have lost which is the ability to organize themselves.\n \n \nI have no wish for the total elimination of israel. I wish for the government of israel to be destroyed completely, and a new on put in its place. A complete restructuring is in order. They have too many war criminals making too many decisions. It is a time for a change. Maybe you mean my wish for the destruction of an ethnically pure israel?\n\n \n Changing your stance?\n \n \"I don't believe in the resolution that created israel because I don;t believe the UN had the authority to do so.\"\n \n \"All the militabnts call for now is the return of their land that was illegally seized\"\n \n So your belief that the creation of Israel was illegal and your siding with the militants comes to an end?\n \n \nWhat isreal wants to do is hold onto the territories, but keep the population as \"un-people). This is not OK.\n\n \n This is the one place we can both come to an agreement. The UN allows Israel to maintain these pieces of land, ending any doubt as to whose land it is, and therefore hopefully ending the violence over control of the land. Israel finally becomes a stable nation and the Arabs in the country are able to live a relative equals to the Israelis.\n \n The problems I see arising out of this would be a possible civil war in Israel, but more importantly I believe it is possible that terrorist attacks continue against Israel. Years of hate do not just disappear over night. If this were to occur what would you suggest doing about it? What would the UN or US do about it? It would have to be taken very seriously at that point as all issues should be resolved and the fighting should have no basis for continuing.",

   "But we are not legally required to do so. Therefore we can legally make it legal for Israel to continue to hold this land. So how exactly can they be their illegally???\n\n \n We are not LEGALLY ABLE to do so. We are operating entirely outside the law on this. We cannot make it legal for israel to hold that land. The \"roadmap\" is an illegal arrangement. \n \n \n \n \nPoint me over to the law we are breaking and I'll point you over to the rule that states that we can work our way around that law. We are doing nothing illegal and we are operating entirely within the law.\n \n \n The US is not breaking laws in the israli-Palestenian conflict. israel is. We are just supporting them (shich is not in and of itself illegal). They are holding land which they have illegally gained. Ther eis no rule that allows this. It is absolutly and without question illegal. Even israel has not claimed their occupation is legal. They know it is illegal and have admitted as much, they just think they have a good excuse. \n \n \nClinton was able to free hardened criminals in his last day of presidency. Was it unlawful to do so? If I did it then it would be unlawful. But he has the power to work his way around the laws legally. Therefore what the president did was legal\n. \n \n This is because according to the laws of the united states the president has the right to grant pardons. \n \n \nSame with the UN/US/Israel situation. If Israel just took those lands and the UN security council all voted to support UN law and declare Israel's occupation as illegal, then it would be illegal. However the US has the power to work around this rule therefore making it legal for Israel to hold this land without anyone being outside the law.\n\n \n This is a very poor and factually inaccurate comparison. Nobody has the right to grant pardosn for violation of international law. Not the US, not the UN, nobody. The UNSC does not have to pass a resolution declaring a particualr action illegal for it to be illegel, in fact there is almost never such a resolution passed. Israel is already in violation of several resolutions (mroe than any other country on the planet, in fact). The US has allowed passage of resolutions condeming their actions, they just veto any resolutions that would use force against israel. \n \n Slave trading is a violation of international law. Nations that support the slave trade have been dealt with severely for it. There has never actually been a resolution passed declaring any particular instance of slave trading to be illegal, it is just understood that ALL slave trading is illegal.\n \n Your local prosecutor does not sit down and decide on a case by case basis whether or not things are illegal. The law is a set of written rules. Something is either illegal or it is not, regardless of whether or not the prosecutro likes it, or the judge likes it, or the accused likes it. \n \n International law is the same way.. It is not a matter of declaring something illegal on a case by case basis. Illegal activities are clearly defined. Israel is in violation. End of story.\n \n \n \nYes it would be legal but there are many other things that are possible legal solutions as well, one of which is the US using its power to legally allow Israel to maintain control over these lands.\n\n \n THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO ALLOW ISRAEL TO LEGALLY MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THESAE LANDS. Even if the palestenians all agreed to it, it would stil not be legal. The US does NOT have the power to give israel what does nto belong to the us, including the occupied territories. That is simply not the way it works. Without re-drafting a dozen international treaties, including the charter of the UN, there is NO WAY for israel to legally maintain control of those territories. We cannot just nullify international law as it suits us. This is not the way it works.\n \n \n \nAnd the Europeans out killed the Indians by a greater margin than that. Should we just pack up and leave the entire continent because of it? Again, body count has nothing to do with it. For instance if the US were attacked by a foreign nation the way Israel is being attacked by Palestinians, I would fully support the US out killing our enemies 33 to 1. If my nation is at risk then do whatever it takes to defend ourselves. That is why I empathize with Israel. \n \n \n Israel is in vioaltion of the law. End of story. They are not being invaded by the palestenians, instead they are the invaders. If you invade, you get what you get as far as problems with the indigneous population. \n \n As far as teh europeans killing the indians, that is too bad. In theory, international law was created to stop such things from happening. \n \n \nThey are on the defensive as people like you wish to see them completely destroyed and they have ONE FREAKING ALLY AGAINST THE ENTIRE WORLD. \n \n \n Thats because they are CRIMINALS. Do you feel sorry for serial killers? The whole world is pretty much against them as well, and for good reason, except for a few folks (serial killers actually have fan clubs, as odd as that may seem).\n \n They are on the defensive against the entire world because they have commited a crime for which the world wishes to see them brought to justice. What you have is one CRIMINAL nation being aided by another. That ONE ALLY AGAINST THE WHOLE FREAKING WORLD is WAY more than they deserve. \n \n \nI'm glad we are the ones who stand up for Israel and I'm just as glad that Israel is willing to stand up for themselves against these terrorists. The rest of the world can just sit back and call the Israelis the aggressors but they are not the ones who have to be afraid to ride a bus for fear that it will be blown up or keep a close eye on every one of their borders for fear of a massive and coordinated surprise attack at any given moment. I know of no other country in history that has had to deal with what Israel is dealing with today. If it were America or Russia or France that had to deal with this type of situation year after year, decade after decade, and they were the only ones capable of nuclear attacks against their enemies, you can be sure they would have all gone that route. I applaud Israel for showing restraint and not having a 900-1 kill ratio at this point.\n\n \n They are also not the ones who have to worry about tanks and helicopters firing on civilian crowds, or living in a refuge camp with no water, or worse, living in refuge camps that are hit by artillery, or having their neiborghood leveled by bombs and rocket barrages while soldier machine gun women and children who try to escape. \n \n The mess israel is in right now is entirely of their own making. It is a product of greed and pride. They get what they get. If a guy robs a convenience store and is shot in the process, he deservs no sympathy. Israel is no different. they are in the midst of commiting a CRIME. Any damage that comes to them in the process is deserved.\n \n \n \nGee, intentional slaughter of unarmed civilians. Lets see here...who else do I remember doing that? Oh yeah, the Palestinians! In fact their main form of military strategy revolves around this practice. And yet you support them. Go figure.\n\n \n Hmmm, 40,000 palestenians killed in 48 hours........8 israelis killed on a bus. Which one would you really call slaughter? If I was in the palestenians shoes, I would absolutly be killing as many israelis as I could, until either their government got the message and backed off, or their government collapsed. \n \n \n \nDefine illegal occupying force then. How were the British the illegal occupying force at that time? They founded the country. How could they not legally be the rightful owners of it?\n \n \n \n They weren't an illegally occupying force. I was just giving an example of a historical example of guerilla tactics and how they pertain to civilian property damage.\n \n \n \nClosely interconnected but who did they actually go to war with? Of course it was the people who were harboring the terrorists and not the terrorists themselves.\n\n \n No, not just closely interconnected, so deeply intertwined as to make them indistinguishable. BL was equivelent to their secretary of defense, and ALL of the leaders of afghanistan wer not just supporters of, but members of AQ. Fighting the Taliban WAS fighting AQ, since they were all the same folks.\n \n \n \nI'm a part of the United States. I bought this computer. Did the United States orchestrate my buying this computer? Bin Laden was part of the Taliban but that doesn't mean the Taliban are directly responsible for orchestrating anything that he did and they did not. Bin Laden was given support by the Taliban to make terrorist attacks such as the one on 9/11 just as the US has supported me with a working economy in which to make money to buy this computer. They are not directly related. Therefore the UN waged a war on an associate to terrorism.\n\n \n This is what you are not catching.....The senior leaders of the taliban were, to a man, also ranking members of AQ. It is not just that they were supporting them, it is not just that they were providing safe harbor for them, they were one in the same. The alleged \"mastermind\" of the 9/11 attacks was a ranking member of the taliban. We COULD NOT take AQ qithout taking the taliban. for all intents and purposes, the taliban had become little more than a branch of AQ that handled domestic policy.\n \n \n \nOK the UN cannot declare war but their member can. While I was unspecific about this I'm sure you understood what I meant. Anyways al Queda lives on while the Taliban is gone. That is because the member of the UN decided to focus on something manageable such as the country of Afghanistan and the government that was an associate to the 9/11 attack. It would be far too difficult to wage war with an organization like al Queda because they exist in too many countries such as Pakistan. Don't think for a moment either that there are not training camps in Pakistan.\n\n \n We went into Afghanistan to get AQ. We thought we could move in, get Bin Laden and get the senior leadership. The theory was, cut the head off the beast and it will wither and die. instead, we learned the hard way that the soviets were not incompetent bafoons, but that the terrain and social climate in Afghanistan are not such that military operations can be conducted easily. AQ lives on because we missed. We underestimated the difficulties inherent to invading a country like afghanistan. Instead of attempting a wide scale invasion, which likely would have resulted in the deaths of thousands of Americans, we invested in a strategy that relied heavily on cooperation with the northern alliance, regional war lords, and special forces troops. The Northern alliance proved to be reliable, the warlords did not, and our special froces were not nearly as effective as we had believed they would be.\n \n \n \nPre 9/11 they were able to coordinate the second largest attack against the US in our history. Since then they haven't been able to do anything significant even with more members, more money, and more support. They need all these things just to try and break even with what they have lost which is the ability to organize themselves.\n\n \n Their surrent strategy of supporting insurgency in Iraq is likely to prove much more effective than their 9/11 raid was. By forcing the US to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on operations there, in addiiotn to the costs of rebuilding, they are effectively driving us to economic ruin. In addition to this, their attacks in Saudi Arabia have destabilised the entire country, and are costin US business interests there billions. \n \n The premise that their ability to organise has been crippled is a farce. At one time you would have needed a large command and control center to organise such a force. Now 10 guys in a tent with a satellite dish can pull it off. The proof of this is in teir increased funding. With the increased attention being paid by the US (and those we have coerced into aiding us) to funds transfers in the name of counter terrorism it takes a great deal of organisation and control just to transfer that kind of money around without it being nabbed in the process.\n \n \nChanging your stance?\n \n \"I don't believe in the resolution that created israel because I don;t believe the UN had the authority to do so.\"\n \n \"All the militabnts call for now is the return of their land that was illegally seized\"\n \n So your belief that the creation of Israel was illegal and your siding with the militants comes to an end?\n\n \n No, still think the creation of israel was illegal and I still side with the militant. It is just toola te to do anything about the creation question\n \n \nThis is the one place we can both come to an agreement. The UN allows Israel to maintain these pieces of land, ending any doubt as to whose land it is, and therefore hopefully ending the violence over control of the land. Israel finally becomes a stable nation and the Arabs in the country are able to live a relative equals to the Israelis.\n\n \n Sadly, this will probably not happen, though it would certainly be the solution that would be betst for all involved. Unfortunalty, those in charge of israel are adamant that it is, and always should be, a jewish state. If you actually went with a one state solution, teh jews would be heavily outnumbered in short order, thus destroying the zionists vision of an ethnically pure israel. \n \n It kind of makes you wonder what they are going to do when they are outnumbered just through birth. This will almost certianly happen within 15 years. Apparently the arabs who ARE israeli citizens are just breeding faster than the jews. \n \n \nThe problems I see arising out of this would be a possible civil war in Israel, but more importantly I believe it is possible that terrorist attacks continue against Israel. Years of hate do not just disappear over night. If this were to occur what would you suggest doing about it? What would the UN or US do about it? It would have to be taken very seriously at that point as all issues should be resolved and the fighting should have no basis for continuing.\n\n \n I think you would absolutly see attacks until the current generation has passed. Israel has killed hundreds of thousands of palestenians, you cannot expect those who have lost family members to just forget about it. Thisis going to happen regardless of the outcome of the current situation. While the israelis and the palestenian authority can make all teh arrangements they want, there will still be some on both sides who are unhappy and will wish to continue the violence. We have seen this before. Again, this is just one of the penalty for acting in the fashion that they have. It is something that will have to be dealt with until a new generation takes over, one not so close to the killing.\n \n \nIf the Americans were in the same boat as the Israelis I would hope you would wish the same. Regardless of what side you land on it is your way of life that is being threatened and you should defend that.\n\n \n If America was in the same boat as israel, illegally occupying land, turning a huge segment of the populatin into second class citizens without rights, and directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands in the name of racial purity, I would do everything in my power to destroy the infrastucture and government of America.\n \n If america was engaging in such atrocities, it would only be becasue we had allowed an evil, tyranical government to take power. Consicence would not allow me to do anything but utilise every resource within my power to destroy that government.",

The only thing that really matters is that the UN law has no say over this matter right now because its hands are tied behind their backs.

Realistically, israelis are more likely to be electrocuted than killed in an attacke, they are more likely to drown at home, they are more likely be hit by a car. The terrorism threat in israel is not as great as they have played it up to be.\n\n \n I am also more likely to die slipping on a banana peel than being killed by terrorists in the US. Does that mean I shouldn't be worried about it? I'm not as worried as much about my own life as I am worried about my way of life being protected. I don't think you will find that most Israelis are willing to support their government against the Palestinians because they are fearing death. Their reasons will be similar to the reasons Americans support our war on terror.\n \n \nBy contrast, a palestenian is actually more likely to be killed during a raid than they are to die of old age.\n\n \n Not to get too much in the habit of paraphrasing you but again, terrorists bring it upon themselves then they get what they get.",

   "I find it amazing that 40,000 people in a terrorist-ridden country can be randomly killed without taking out ONE terorist?! Who'd a thunk it.\n\n \n Heh, good point.\n \n \nIf the US had a similar rate of terrorists acts, we'd have deported all Arabs long ago. Israel has used amazing restraint IMO.\n\n \n Same thing I would say. No other country would put up with these terrorists for nearly as long as Israel has. With the US it took just one attack before people in Dearborn, Michigan were out in the streets fighting Arab citizens of the US. Israelis must have to use all their will power not to want to go OJ Simpson on the Arabs living in their country. The government has to show the same restraint when looking across the border into Lebanon and being able to see known members of terrorists groups and not ordering their men to fire on them.\n \n \nMaybe they should consider that the next time they send tiheir kids out with bombs strapped to them.

   "Edit: While I did have a section debating the legality of Israelis occupation I've decided to remove it. It really doesn't matter one way or the other. By definition it could go either way. The only thing that really matters is that the UN law has no say over this matter right now because its hands are tied behind their backs. The UNs opinion is just moot now which is why I think this fighting is going on in the first place. If the UN would just decide on way or the other then 10 years from now this would be over. But if they do not then 10 years from now it will still be going on.\n\n \n Hopefully you removed it befcause you wne tand learned a little more about international law, and realised there is nothing there to debate, UN or no. \n \n \nPersonally I was in support of destroying Falluja only a few weeks ago so I guess I can't say I would be against the US killing 40,000 civilians in order to save a few of our own. It might not provide the intended result but when pushed to a certain point I can understand where doing this sort of action can gain support.\n\n \n I would suggest you immediatly head off for a combat zone so you have some idea of what you are suggesting here. I think you are having trouble with realistically realising exactly how many dead people you are talking here. 3 dead people, you can get your head around, 10,000 dead people is so big as to be almost unimaginable. Do you have any idea how many dump trucks it takes to move 10,000 dead bodiues? Have you ever seen a dump truck full of bidies? Or helped load a dump truck full of bodues? I would definatly suggest you try it sometime.\n \n \nThe Taliban would have existed with or without al Queda. al Queda wouldn't exist at the same level as they did in 2001 without the Taliban. The Taliban was allowing al Queda to operate there. Members of al Queda were in the Taliban but the Taliban were not controlling them and al Queda was using money, not loyal support, to get what they needed from the Taliban.\n\n \n \n The taliban would have existed without AQ, but they wouldn't have controlled Afghanistan.\n \n \nI am also more likely to die slipping on a banana peel than being killed by terrorists in the US. Does that mean I shouldn't be worried about it? I'm not as worried as much about my own life as I am worried about my way of life being protected. I don't think you will find that most Israelis are willing to support their government against the Palestinians because they are fearing death. Their reasons will be similar to the reasons Americans support our war on terror.\n\n \n So, in order to preserve a racially pure state, the israelis are willing to kill off the entire palestaenian population? this seems like their policy. Sure, theyw ant to preserve their way of life. Unfortunatly, the world changes. Tehre are those int he US who afully support killing or deporting all mexicans, blacks, etc... in order to preserve our way of life here. You should definatly get in touch with these people, you guys speak the same language.\n \n \n \nNot to get too much in the habit of paraphrasing you but again, terrorists bring it upon themselves then they get what they get.\n\n \n See, you are coming around. I say go gety the terrorists if they really think they can (shich they can't), just quite killing civilians. Not all palestenains are terrorists, so they need to quite painting them with a broad brush. Not all palestenaians re resposible for the actions of the terrorists. Organisations like Hamas are not democratic, they are not in power because a majority of the people voted them into power.\n \n \n \nI find it amazing that 40,000 people in a terrorist-ridden country can be randomly killed without taking out ONE terorist?! Who'd a thunk it.\n\n \n Actually, they killed 1204 terrorists. These were kept in a seperate category, and eanybody that israel could concievably call a terrorist was put in this category. It hardly seems that killing 40,000 civilians in order to get 1204 terrorists is justifiable.\n \n \nIf the US had a similar rate of terrorists acts, we'd have deported all Arabs long ago. Israel has used amazing restraint IMO.\n\n \n The day will come when we do have a similar rate of terrorist attacks, assuming we don't spend ourselves into non existance before that. How we deal with it will be our first real test as a nation since WWII. We passed the last test, this one I am unsure about. Israel has failed miserably. \n \n \nMaybe they should consider that the next time they send tiheir kids out with bombs strapped to them. You reap what you sow.\n\n \n Again, you have a funny, americanised notion of what a \"kid\" is. Sometimes you do reap what you sow, but as a supporter if israel I seriosly doubt you want to see this happen. Surely you would not be in support of a vastlyu superior military force rolling into israel and lsaughtering 100,000 israelis and turning the rest into second class citizens would you? \n \n \nWe'd NEVER send our women and kids out with bombs strapped to them to kill innocent civilians. NO WAY, NO HOW! If you think otherwise, then you're delusional.\n\n \n You are trying to turn the palestenians into animals because of the fact that less thna 1% of the bombers have been women or \"children\"? Are you kidding? These are people who make their own decisions. Usually their familis do not even know about until it is already over. And we would certianly use women and \"children\" (which is in quotes becasue my definition of \"child\" is obviously very differnt from yours) if we felt it was needed. Every culture, every state, has used their women and \"children\" when it was deemed necessary.\n \n \nAnd, by the way, what IS a \"Palestinian combatant\"? Someone who blows themselves up in a crowd of civilians isn't a combatant, they're a TERRORIST.\n\n \n Call it what you like, terminology makes little difference.",

   "Hopefully you removed it befcause you wne tand learned a little more about international law, and realised there is nothing there to debate, UN or no. \n\n \n Actually I removed it over the hopelessness of the debate based on the actual definitions of illegal and legal. Your being able to get away with speeding because an authority figure allows it actually makes it legal for you to speed by definition. However there is still a law in place that makes it illegal. So which is it? Legal or illegal for you to speed? Which one takes precidence? My opinion would be that the authority figure is placing you above the law meaning it is legal for you to speed. I'm sure you would contend otherwise though and neither of us can show exactly why we have to be correct. It is a hopeless debate that doesn't even matter.\n \n \nI would suggest you immediatly head off for a combat zone so you have some idea of what you are suggesting here.

However I do know what it means to kill 3,000 people. How many trips did it take in New York to move the dead out? Then to see another 1,000 dead in Iraq. If our response to this would have been to go in an brutally destroy Falluja killing 40,000, I can't say I would have been against the action as long as it was believed it would save American lives.\n \n \nThe taliban would have existed without AQ, but they wouldn't have controlled Afghanistan.\n\n \n The Taliban controlled Afghanistan because of the US help which put them in power.\n \n \nSo, in order to preserve a racially pure state, the israelis are willing to kill off the entire palestaenian population? this seems like their policy.

You should definatly get in touch with these people, you guys speak the same language.\n\n \n There are always radicals around but they do not speak for the general population. Democracy takes care of that problem. In Israel it is not a racially pure state in the first place. Even some Arabs have rights there. The radicals may not like this but the rational people support it. Same here in the US as in Israel. Yes I know they don't allow some of their Arab people to vote but that doesn't make it a racially pure state either as they allow them to live there.\n \n \nSee, you are coming around. I say go gety the terrorists if they really think they can (shich they can't), just quite killing civilians. Not all palestenains are terrorists, so they need to quite painting them with a broad brush. Not all palestenaians re resposible for the actions of the terrorists. Organisations like Hamas are not democratic, they are not in power because a majority of the people voted them into power.\n\n \n That is not what I'm saying at all. If there were terrorists living in the US and they blew up something in France and France attacked some of our cities believed to be harboring terrorists, my opinion would of course be to hate France for this but also for the US to wake up and fight these terrorists ourselves. If the Palestinians did this same thing then I would see no reason as to why their civilians are bringing these attacks upon themselves. However they are not doing this meaning they are part of the problem and they will get what they get. Same with Syria and Lebanon as well.\n \n \nThe day will come when we do have a similar rate of terrorist attacks, assuming we don't spend ourselves into non existance before that. How we deal with it will be our first real test as a nation since WWII. We passed the last test, this one I am unsure about. Israel has failed miserably.\n \n \n Israel has been forced to fight with one hand tied behind their backs. We are doing the same thing in Iraq. Of course it would lead us both to the path of failure doing this. If you want us to really fight terrorism you let use actually wield our power and irradicate anyone who we even think is a terrorists. We can do it but it would be at the cost of many lives. If we even use our heads when it comes to thinks like al Saders Falluja military then we would be better off. We knew he was building an army there but we did nothing until it was too late. Then we didn't go in there and destroy them, we just let them stay there. Stupid! We have to take a harder line against terrorists like this to defeat them.\n \n [QUOTE]Again, you have a funny, americanised notion of what a \"kid\" is.

Iraq was purely a US public refocus and opportunity to polish GDP numbers for re-election purposes. That region will never stabilize with our continued presence and support of Israel.
