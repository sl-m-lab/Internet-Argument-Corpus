Maybe its just my typo ridden history book, but polititions of the past seemed to be of a much higher quality\"\n \n - Democrat or Republican depends how they run the nation and this is an important factor. I think that if you were living back then you would not be saying they were higher quality. Nor back then did they have such furious campaign routes to work with such as tv, internet, excessive signs....\n Also I don't think politicans back then were racking up millions for their campaign.\n \n \n \"infact its not just the polititions its the whole system, america in my eyes is going down the drian. I see more and more of my rights fading away. I wonder what the founding forfathers of this country would think if they saw what america has become. yeh so i guess the question is..\"\n \n - Where do you see this? What rights are being taken away from you? Our \"founding fathers\" ideas about this country are irrelevant because they aren't alive nor are they in power. \n \n \"Is America is what you want it to be?\"\n \n - America is the most powerful country in the world. Besides the fact that I WANT to live in Utopia, I think the US is the best country to live in, although I could ask more. (Liberalize the country ;) )\n \n \"Are we becoming better or worse as time passes?\"\n \n - I have seen no evidence for either side.\n \n \"do you think america will be around in the future? \n \n - It depends how far in the future you are speaking about. Say 500 years no. 100 years, probably not. 50 years yes. Because of corrupt the world is with humanity and humanity having nuclear weapons, someone is going to get trigger happy. The next big war will be a nuclear holocaust which could knock us back to the stone age. (you get the picture)\n \n \n \"I love this country for what opertunitys it has given me, but i must say that unless changes occur, this modernday rome may go the way of the old.\"\n \n - What changes are you referring to.

I think far left is defined as ideas that most people on the left are too extreme. Same for far right.\n \n \nWhich European countries? Why do you exclude other democracies such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand? Are there no good examples amongst us?\n\n \n Germany for instance. I know Canada does fine but is that because they are right next to the US and have NAFTA or isn't it? I know little about the Austrailian government or economic system. So how would you compare the government and economic system of Australia to that of socialist Europe countries like Germany.\n \n \nleft and right are equally matched - how do you change governments in America?

(I think he's a Governor of one of your western states).\n \n Hey, what would you think if I told you that we have compulsory voting?\n\n \n Jesse is no longer governor in Minnesota. I knew only what I heard about him from friends and that consisted mostly of how he didn't know what he was doing. As far as him being far left or right, I don't think he was. I don't think we have ever had someone who is far left or right in office because they are such a small minority. Dean, who is running for president in the US, is supposed to have a very tough time getting elected because he is pretty far left. I don't think he is even being treated as a threat to Bush or a realistic candidate for the Democrats (who are praying that Gore or Clinton step forward) to win the 2004 election. He won't get the centralist vote which will hurt him badly.\n \n Compulsory voting is an interesting concept to me and I think it is something that I would like to see occur. I don't think there is enough support for this idea to be put into place though because voting is treated much like part of our freedom in the US. We are free to vote. We are not restricted or forced to vote, we are free to vote. Because it is viewed this way I don't think it will be put into place although it is a good concept if it is well accepted. It would help make people more politically aware and help ensure democracy because our people would be more political and involved in the democratic process.",
