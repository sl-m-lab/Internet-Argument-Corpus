   "It's easy to criticize without offering an alternative. The Democrats are king of the tactic, but I'll pose this sceanrio to you since you aren't a Democrat.\n \n Scenario\n We had just lost our biggest ally in the ME to Islamic Fundamentalist Ayatollahs who began engaging in a Holy War against their neighbor, Iraq. In all liklihood, Iraq would have fallen because Iran was sending human waves of fanatics seeking martyrdom, a feat that Iraq couldn't come close to matching since their population wasn't as large. SA would have been next, based on Iran's own statements. How would you have reacted? What latitude would you have offerred Iraq?\n\n \n That's all speculation. The US, and others, assisted Saddam because there was money to be made, no other reason. After the Shah of Iran's fall Iran's new government was not seeking US investment and Saddam was, so the US supplied Iraq, and to a lesser extent Iran. That was long before Canada's oil production increased to surpass the Sauds as the primary US crude supplier and the world, including the new Iranian government, knew the US would defend the Sauds and Kuwait with whatever was required. The US would have been far happier if they (Iraq/Iran) had destroyed each to allow exploitation of both countries by a multinational force led by the US. Every major power had big money in Iraq and when they didn't stay bought by the US with Saddam's oil for Euros scheme, we whacked Iraq and them.",

They know that while interests of great importance to them are jeopardized by the Gulf crisis, their ability to influence the course of the struggle is limited. America's leverage in particular has been circumscribed: at the outset of the war we did not have diplomatic relations with either Baghdad or Teheran and were not supplying arms to either side. Moreover, once the U.S. position in Iran had been lost as the result of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Islamic revolution, and once the world saw that it could absorb the loss of a major portion of Iraqi and Iranian oil without shortages or continuing price increases, the stake for the United States and its allies in the progress of the war no longer seemed as great. This was the case, at least, as long as the war appeared headed toward a military impasse, and as long as it did not spread to other countries in the Gulf. And indeed, for the first 18 months of the war, the course of the conflict seemed to stay comfortably within those parameters. Washington was content to set up a watching brief.\n \n The evolution of the Iraq-Iran war in the past two years has, however, drawn the United States into a larger role in the conflict. The first shift in U.S. official attitudes came in the wake of Iran's impressive military victories in 1982, when it appeared that the Iraqis might collapse, leaving Iran in a commanding position of power throughout the Gulf. Washington gradually abandoned its policy of neutrality and non-involvement in favor of a \"tilt\" toward Iraq, although recognizing that there was little the United States could do to give practical effect to this policy shift.http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19840901faessay8401/michael-sterner/the-persian-gulf-the-iran-iraq-war.html&familyfilter=1\n \n\n \n We certainly saw Iran and its attempt to spread Islamic Fundamentalism as being a greater threat, that's why we abandoned our position of neutrality and backed the losing horse at the time. Iraq was the lesser of two evils, for sure.",

   "Zacvac, I honestly beleive that the democrats say there are rape rooms and that the country is a mess because it is their way of trashing the republicans so they can win the presidental elections of 2008\n \n\n Look at statistics, hard facts. Everyone believes it's a mess, some just think it's better than before and can be fixed, while others think it's a lost cause.\n \n \n \n\n Now, I am not saying there is not a possibility of there not being any of those horible things. But, it could be. The country of Iraq is better today than it has been in a long time. You will have \"bad soldiers\" that rape, murder, or do other bad things to the Iraqi civilians. The Abu Grhaib thing.\n \n\n You somehow know that it's better today? Care to use facts to back that up? Most people do, from both sides.\n \n \n\n But, no. Honestly I think it is all a way to persuade people to vote for their party's nominee in 2008. \n Democrats exagerate the story just to get more votes. For example, the Iraq Civil War idea. That is not true. They are not going or even close toa civil war The Media and the democrats say this, but a friend of mine who was in Iraq last month said no such thing is hapening.\n Questions, please ask.\n\n \n Again, proof? How do you know Iraq isn't in a civil war. I thought that was pretty much fact. There was a recent quote where the guy said \"if this isn't civil war, I'd hate to see what civil war really is\" (paraphrase). There are 2 sides within the same country fighting each other with weapons. How is it not a civil war? Again, if you wish to make the claim that Iraq is all fine and dandy, I expect proof. Maybe it's not quite as bad as some put it, but even the most optomistic Republican won't say that the situation is great in Iraq.",
