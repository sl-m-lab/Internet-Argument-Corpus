   "If histirical revisionism has always been around, then why is there an apparent rise in anti-Chinese sentiments among the Japanese today. The Japanese revisionists have always tried to revise textbooks to reflect their viewpoints. They distorted the official history of Sino-Japanese war, agitated the anti-Chinese sentiments among the Japanese juveniles. They told the Japnese juveniles everyone should be thankful for the war that was waged to \"liberate the Asian countries from the western imperialists\".",
