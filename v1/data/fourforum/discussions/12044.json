   "OK, so I spend a lot of time talking about how Christians and atheists can be friends, and then some stupid person proves me wrong. This is also the type of thing that makes me proud and embarrassed to live in Colorado.\n < please see web-site for billboard image <\n The sign reads \"Don't believe in God? You are not alone.\"\n These billboards have been put up, sponsored by the Colorado Coalition of Reason (COCORE), in Denver and Colorado Springs. A couple of additional signs were supposed to go up in Northern Colorado, where I live, but the media company refused the ads. That&#8217;s not the worst of it.\n \n A lot of Christians who have seen the billboards have found them offensive enough that they felt a need to complain. Some have even accused the billboards of being hate speech and denigrating Christians. One Christian driver who saw the billboard went so far as to say &#8220;It is a despicable act to allow that sign&#8230;&#8221; I, for one, can&#8217;t see how that is possible since the billboards are not speaking to or about Christians or people of faith, they are merely offering support to those unbelievers who may be living in the area.\n \n This really makes me wonder if we unbelievers should start complaining about religious signs and TV shows and radio programs that we find offensive. This goes against every fiber of my being, because I am a very strong supporter of free speech. But maybe they need a dose of their own medicine so they know what it feels like. I don&#8217;t know why some people just can&#8217;t understand that not everyone finds the same things inspirational or offensive. And I don&#8217;t know why not all Americans seem to understand that America is a free, secular nation and that not everyone who lives here is or wants to be a Christian. How can we get that message across without acting as stupid as these complaining Christians?\n \n Is it too much to ask to be treated equally? Whatever happened to &#8220;do unto others as you would have them do unto you&#8221;? It seems that some Christians, at least, don&#8217;t actually believe in the golden rule, never mind the Constitution.http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4465\n \n I found this interesting because there has been some talk of religious \"intolerance\" lately (in the gay threads), and I can't help but think that the approach being used was like complaining about a paper cut on one person while ignoring the freshly severed limb on another person.\n \n I will readily agree that there are SOME (rare) atheists who disagree vehemently with Christians, and do / say things that are patently offensive. Bill Maher is one \"good\" example.\n \n But on the flip side of the coin, there is SOCIETAL PREJUDICE against atheists that people rarely speak of. In fact, I believe that the \"anti-Christian\" rhetoric receives MORE attention cause the Christians in society WANT it to have more attention than the Christian prejudice against atheists.\n Media favoritism...\n \n Christians complain that they can't put up a huge ten commandments monument in a Southern court-house, when the truth is that it HAS NO PLACE there. \n (If you like it so much, put it in your church foyer. A religious symbol in a religious place. Imagine that! emoticon_xgood)\n \n But on the flip side of the coin, MOST AMERICANS REFUSE to vote for an atheist, simply because that person is atheist. emoticon_wow\n Black President More Likely than Mormon or Atheist\n \n Another commentary can be found here...\n http://friendlyatheist.com/6422/questioning-god-is-apparently-hate-speech/",

What I gather from those that do not believe in any god is that they mainly base their beliefs on logic and reason. Like someone stated some are rather obnoxious (like Maher) others are more reserved and prefer not to argue about it (I guess they see there is no point). As for the sign, I do not know why people find it offensive. It's kind of like the Christians that see aborted babies on the side of van and see nothing wrong with it. I think those that complain are just being silly, as I would believe an atheist being silly for complaining about Christmas trees.emoticon_frazzled",

This is a 'I-know-you-are-but-what-am-I sort of post you've made here. Sorta like \"Nope, me more, you less. :p \n \n Bottom line: it doesn't matter. People are going to vote based on the issues they feel is most important to be protected. Religious rights are being attacked in OTHER ways--like trying to strike the right of any engagement of religious activity from the public venue.

Period.\n\n \n And I just gave you the reasons for that, Foundit. The problem is that you're LOOKING for prejudice as the cause and once again trying see demons where none necessarily exist. NO one is denying a majority refuse to vote for an atheist president. It makes perfect sense when the vast majority are religious and believe that's a important part of life. What it doesn't prove is some widespread anti-atheist hatred or prejudice that seems to be what you're implying here, a la the martyr complex on your part. A majority would never vote for someone who was very much outside the mainstream with his views.

You can't. There's an inherent intolerance over one of the most important issues to them in life, period. \n \n Perhaps you should entertain the analogy of expecting gays to vote for a candidate who doesn't believe being gay is legitimate--and then intimating they're wrong or doing the wrong thing if they DON'T vote for such a candidate. Because it's not like we aren't talking about an issue that is very dear and important to many, many people.\n \n No one is saying atheists are evil, or green-eyed monsters, or whatever other thing you might be reading into this. But when your views are much different on what is a MAJOR issue to many people, I can't blame them for voting for the candidate that would NOT be different on an issue of that significance to them. \n \n \nAnd if that \"ideal\" is \"he's a man, ergo he thinks like a man should\" to discriminate against women.\n Or if that \"ideal\" is \"he's a Christian and not a Jew, ergo he thinks like a Christian should\"...\n\n \n So then, Are you saying blacks shouldn't be voting for someone who better can identify with them--a black person? What if a woman feels THAT IS important, and therefore wants to vote for a woman? THAT'S why Christians say they would vote for a religious person Foundit, and not an atheist. Your link didn't give REASONS people would vote that way. You're just ASSUMING something awful and negative. You're going LOOKING for prejudice and anti-atheist bias as the reason. But it's far more likely the reason is that most people simply vote based on what they think is important, and that MEANS they naturally wouldn't vote for an atheist. If the poll asks the question that way, how the heck are they supposed to answer it? You've fallen victim to one of the most common problems with statistics and polls: leading questions. It can make people read something into the situation as far as prejudice or bias is concerned if they don't take into consideration there are OTHER (in this case more LIKELY) reasons for people saying they would vote that way. It's completely understandable alone based on peoples' tendency to vote toward something they believe better understands them (and therefore by default, the vote will be against the one who isn't).\n \n \n1) Don't pull the \"no true Scotsman\" fallacy. It's meaningless in this context.\n\n \n No, you misunderstood. Quite simply, if every candidate professes to be Christian, it's no feat to say that you vote for Christians.

   "I said nothing of the sort. I did say that atheists aren't open to any belief toward religion, and therefore I question how someone like that could represent me and most people in government.\n\n 1) When it's an SIMILE (hence, the \"like\"), it's taken as read that you didn't \"say\" that.\n 2) Atheists aren't open TO THEIR OWN personal beliefs in a God. You assume too much in pretending that they aren't open at all, to the extent that they could not represent you.\n \n 3) A better question would be how you think they would be deficient in representing you.\n What would they do that a Christian would be more representative of?\n \n \n \nAnd indeed, I would be completely understandable if an atheist felt a religious person couldn't represent him in government as well as another atheist in terms of THIS issue.\n\n The point is that you do not understand why most atheists do not have that feeling.\n Your approach is very segregationist in mentality, with very little explicit explanation as to why...\n \n \n \nI'm not making the case that people shouldn't vote for atheists.\n\n I don't think anybody said you were.\n The point is that you were one of the people who would not vote for atheist.\n \n \n \nI AM making the case that people vote for what they think is important to them and can best represent them an their interests. EVERYBODY does that.\n\n And again with the vague-ifying of things to the point that you virtually abandon the topic.\n Yes. People vote for what they think is important to them.\n Nazis did it in Germany.\n KKK members have done it before, and do it today.\n \n So, by your vague-ifying attempt, we're all like the nazis and KKK!\n Can we return to the SPECIFICS of the topic now? Specifically discussing WHY it is important for you that a politician needs to believe in God.\n \n \n \nAnd so I'm saying I understand it at least, and can't say I blame them.\n\n \"Them\"?\n Aren't you one of \"them\"?\n Aren't you one of the crowd who will not vote for an atheist?\n \n \n \nA perfect example of your CLAFCLO thing.\n\n No. Another example of how you abuse the term.\n I was not trying to pretend that you were arguing against that.\n \n You are obfuscating the point. MY POINT was that atheists are MORE INCLINED TO RESPECT \"freedom of religion\" importance cause they NEED it more.\n \n \n \nI think it plays out in different ways. In some areas, yes, atheists experience it more. In areas related to academics, for instance, and the sciences, I think Christians may experience it more at the hands of atheists.\n\n That's an absurd claim.\n Science plays by scientific rules. There are standards.\n Christians sometimes attempt to BREAK these standards by introducing things like \"creation science\" and other junk that does not meet those scientific standards.\n \n That isn't discrimination.\n It's a requirement that Christians adhere to the standards like everybody else.\n We're back in the \"religion jealous of reason\" realm where you attempt to claim \"discrimination\" when the truth is that religion is attempting to invade the realm of reason.\n \n \n \nBeside the point as I doubt you've ever undergone ANY real persecution for being an atheist, either.\n\n I'm not an atheist.\n But what experience I HAVE seen is where Christians are comfortable sharing their faith in the work-place.\n AND THEY SHOULD BE.\n But the point is that I have NEVER had an atheist tell me about their atheism in the work-place. With such animosity towards atheists, can it be any surprise?\n \n I asked you whether or not you knew any atheists, and without surprise you didn't answer me...\n \n Earlier, iangb posted a link to other examples of anti-atheist discrimination.\n http://www.4forums.com/political/religion-debates/12044-where-real-intolerance-lies.html#post334906\n \n \n \nThis is a 'I-know-you-are-but-what-am-I sort of post you've made here. Sorta like \"Nope, me more, you less. :p \n\n Say whaaa?\n We have provided some quantification of the discrimination against atheists.\n You ARE AN EXAMPLE OF the reasons why this exists.\n \n Quite frankly, I've seen a variety of Christians CLAIMING discrimination, when the truth is something far different. Like cases where they claim it is \"religious discrimination\" if they can't fire a gay person for being gay. But of course, we can't imagine that means there is a BASIS for saying that there is a Christian anti-gay prejudice base, especially when Christians explicitly state that discriminating against gays is in their religion...\n \n \n \nBottom line: it doesn't matter.\n\n Quite frankly, if you really believe that, then stop responding.\n The truth is that you KNOW I have a point, and that's why you're here obfuscating and misrepresenting it.\n \n \n \nPeople are going to vote based on the issues they feel is most important to be protected.\n\n Yes.\n The KKK, Nazis, and people who refuse to vote for atheists are all perfect examples of that.\n \n \n \nReligious rights are being attacked in OTHER ways--like trying to strike the right of any engagement of religious activity from the public venue.\n\n Separation of church and state is NOT an attack.\n I swear. For each time one of you guys complains about a \"attack on religion\" based on separation of church and state, I wish you could go through a REAL-LIFE SCENARIO where the flip side occurs.\n Like the government gets to put up a government \"activity\" on church property.\n \n THAT you would probably recognize as being \"wrong\".\n But when you do it the other way around, you pretend it's an attack on religion if it's prevented.\n Unbelievable!\n \n \n \nLike trying to take away tax-exemption from entire churches overa ballot initiative vote when there's nothing in law that prevents churches from supporting ballot initiatives.\n\n You don't listen.\n I quoted the law to you TWICE now PROVING that there IS something in the law that \"takes away tax-exemption from entire churches\" when they support legislation.\n The churches CAN \"support ballot initiatives\", but the law states that they LOSE their tax-exempt status when they do so.\n \n \n \nAnd I just gave you the reasons for that, Foundit. The problem is that you're LOOKING for prejudice as the cause and once again trying see demons where none necessarily exist.\n\n Jyoshu, do you think that if you asked a neo-nazi or a KKK \"are you prejudiced\", would they say \"yes\".\n People who are prejudiced ROUTINELY REFUSE TO ADMIT that they are.\n \n One excellent way to demonstrate prejudice is to shift the issue slightly, with the same explanation, and demonstrate the foolishness of the claim.\n If a WHITE person were to proclaim \"I won't vote for a black person because he doesn't understand my white issues\", that would be a red sign that he was a racist.\n \n But you pull some similar nonsense, on a ridiculous claim that atheists won't be able to \"represent\" you in some vague and unexplainable way, and you think it's legit.\n \n \n \nA majority would never vote for someone who was very much outside the mainstream with his views. Who can blame them?\n\n Jyoshu, people don't vote for a candidate who has different POLITICAL views.\n You're trying to vague-ify the issue and proclaim it's just \"views\" in general.\n \n A black man has a different \"view\" of America than a white man. Guess where your logic leads.\n A woman has a different \"view\" of things than a man. Guess where your logic leads.\n \n If a candidate has a VIEW that abortion is evil and should never happen, a \"pro-woman's rights\" voter does not support that candidate because of a POLITICAL VIEW.\n But you say \"atheist\" like you think it IS a political view. Like it somehow automatically makes the person less likely to support your views.\n \n \n \nIf you know someone is a Christian, and there's no room in you thinking for belief in God, how can you be identifying with that person and on the same page as them? You can't. There's an inherent intolerance over one of the most important issues to them in life, period. \n\n I am gay.\n I know people who are straight, and there's no room in my thinking for being straight. So I guess by your logic, I can't identify with a straight person?\n \n You act like religion is somehow the penultimate divider. It isn't.\n The atheist says \"I don't believe in God\", but that doesn't mean the person doesn't support pro-life views. It doesn't mean the person isn't conservative. It doesn't mean the person isn't NRA. It doesn't mean the person isn't Republican.\n \n \n \nPerhaps you should entertain the analogy of expecting gays to vote for a candidate who doesn't believe being gay is legitimate--and then intimating they're wrong or doing the wrong thing if they DON'T vote for such a candidate. Because it's not like we aren't talking about an issue that is very dear and important to many, many people.\n\n THINK about it.\n OVER and OVER and OVER again, I have stressed that my dividing line is SUPPORT FOR ANTI-GAY LEGISLATION.\n Quite frankly, I do not care if a person thinks \"being gay is not legitimate\".\n If that person supports gay equality, that's okay by me.\n \n Do you realize that there are people out there who oppose abortion FOR THEMSELVES, but they support legalized abortion for other people to make their own decision?\n THAT is what I am talking about.\n \n \n \nNo one is saying atheists are evil, or green-eyed monsters, or whatever other thing you might be reading into this.\n\n No one is claiming that anybody is saying that.\n The point is that people are \"saying\" that atheists cannot identify with Christians (or have some significantly reduced capacity for it), and THAT is what is bizarre.\n People are people. Believing or not believing in God doesn't make one more capable of understanding another.\n \n \n \nSo then, Are you saying blacks shouldn't be voting for someone who better can identify with them--a black person?\n\n The issue is people REFUSING to vote for an atheist BECAUSE he is an atheist.\n As such, if a black person refused to vote for anybody but a black person, or non-white person, I would say that is racist.\n \n \n \nTHAT'S why Christians say they would vote for a religious person Foundit, and not an atheist. Your link didn't give REASONS people would vote that way. You're just ASSUMING something awful and negative.\n\n I'm sorry, but AGAIN it's like a forest for the trees moment...\n LOOK at that poll.\n It stated \"XX% will not vote for a black person\".\n Do you think there is racism there?\n \n It stated \"YY% will not vote for a woman\".\n Do you think there is misogyny there?\n \n You're trying to give the whole situation some pretense of acceptability by pretending that people DIFFERENT than you are somehow not able to represent you.\n You're trying to give the whole situation an excuse.\n \n \n \nYou've fallen victim to one of the most common problems with statistics and polls: leading questions. It can make people read something into the situation as far as prejudice or bias is concerned if they don't take into consideration there are OTHER (in this case more LIKELY) reasons for people saying they would vote that way.\n\n I read nothing into it.\n I have never said \"hatred\", so leave that strawman behind.\n I have pointed out it is PREJUDICE, and it is.\n You give a classic sign of prejudice. Ignorance of the class being discriminated against. A pretense that the group being discriminated against are somehow significantly different from you.\n \n If they had asked the question \"Would you employ a person who is _____?\", would you still be trying to excuse the prejudice demonstrated?\n \n \n \nNo, you misunderstood. Quite simply, if every candidate professes to be Christian, it's no feat to say that you vote for Christians. You have no CHOICE but to do so; at least in terms of how they're identifying.\n\n That's part of my point.\n Do you hear atheists complaining that they only have Christians representing them?\n Do you think Christians do a lousy job of representing atheists?\n \n Should I just take it as read that you will ignore those questions?",

   "Why should someone who would prefer people abandon religion and is closed to religion of any degree be more depended on to protect the rights and liberties of religious people, when they don't value religion at all?\n\n \n Let me tell you something that seems totally beyond your comprehension. I do not value religious belief, it is true. Neither do I value rap or heavy metal. But unlike you, I do value the right of people to make choices for themselves, and to have those choices respected by government. If freedom of choice is what you value, and I very much doubt that it is, then of course I could represent anyone in a legisalture without prejudice to their faith, because I would never be voting on issues of pure faith. It would simply not be my business, because it is not the business of government.\n \n It is true I couldn't represent the desire of far too many Christians for a Christianist theocracy.

I would have no qualms at all in voting for a religious candidate, if he or she shared my political philosophy to some degree.\n \n Obviously, you do not share my tolerance for diversity of background, but that does not surprise me in the least.\n \n \nfrankly this whole thing is rather silly.

Candidate who rejects out of hand religion and is not open to it at all, but claims to value religious freedom\n \n Are you seriously telling me that you think it's bad if religious voters choose candidate A if protecting religious liberties is important to them, over candidate B? Why shouldn't they? Why is that something to \"repudiate\"? In the same vein, why would you ever think it should be repudiated if a veteran considers it important to have a president who was actually in the military as a important qualification when protecting service-people and their best interests is something the voter considers important? \n\n \n I realise this may be difficult for you to understand. However, the point that seems to fly right over your head is that religious liberties are as important to any atheist as to any sincere believer. Religious liberties, after all, include the freedom NOT to believe in your cockamamie religions.\n \n If you want to institute a theocracy, as you apparently do, then of course you cannot vote for an atheist, or indeed, for any religious candidate who repsects constitutional liberties.\n \n For someone of your high degree of intolerance for people of diverse religious faiths, I can understand why you would only vote for someone who supported your prejudices. You can't tolerate dissent from your orthodoxy.\n \n \nAlso, your comments about \"theocracy\" and \"tyrants\" don't even apply to this. No one is putting forth the idea here that we should have theocracy or tyranny. The very fact you are use the benignly general phrase \"religious believers\" in the same thought as \"would-be theocratic tyrants\" with no qualifiers as if the two are the same thing tells far more about you than them. And you wonder why some religious people wouldn't want an atheist such as yourself in office, with you sweeping judgments and blanket associative fallacies.\n\n \n The fact that you admit you couldn't bring yourself to vote for someone who doesn't share your religious prejudices makeds the point that you are an avid supporter of Christianist theocracy. No surprise there. It's exactly what I expected of you.\n \n \nSorry, but I simply don't believe you, there--you've let the cat out of the bag too many times how badly you hate religion. I don't believe for a second that if two candidates were running, and one was publicly religious and the other was an atheist that you wouldn't vote for the atheist; you freely associate religion with things like 'theocracy' and 'tyrant' without distinction or qualification here, so why should anyone assume you wouldn't do so at the ballot box? The fact is, most of the time you simply don't have choice, because religion is so common that every candidate identifies with being religious. You'd have to never vote otherwise.\n\n \n You poor, pathetic thing. You have admitted you couldn't vote for anyone not of your religious persuasion; so you project your inability to handle religious diversity on me.\n \n Actually, the only time I consider a candidate's religious affiliation is when they make an issue of them in an election campaign, usually to demonise homosexuals or some other bugoaboo of fundamentalist Christianism.\n \n Obviously, you are incapable of divorcing yourself from your prejudices, but I am not. All I ask of a candidate is that they promote the policies I happen to think are for the good of the soceity I live.\n \n You, on the other hand, want to apply a litmus test to measure the candidate's religious purity, never mind whether he or she is competent, or advocates sound policy.\n \n Your testimony to your own intolerance of diversity is eloquent.\n \n Once again, you are so busted.",

For another, I think you have openly expressed an interest in making your religion the law of the land. That flies in the face of religious tolerance. You are a theocrat by nature.\n \n However, I would have no probems in voting for other religious believers who shared my political views, and who opposed theocracy. If the atheist were a rabid Bush supporter, and the believer were a liberal Democrat, I have no particular loyalties to atheism there. You, apparently, would vote for a fascist so long as he had the \"right\" religious credentials! God help us.\n \n I don't care that you can't wrap your prejudiced mind around that. I just don't think the narrow way you obviously do. You could never vote for an atheist because an atheist would never support theocracy. I can vote for religious believers who do not support theocracy. \n \n Busted, dear boy.",

Your desires and your fears.\n Not indicative of the real world.\n \n 75% of this country is Christian.\n Do you have about 1 in 4 people trying to talk you OUT OF being Christian?\n Which group is the REAL concern here with people pushing beliefs???\n \n \n [quoet=jyoshu]That may be, but they are still religious. Atheists aren't and therefore it stands to reason a religious person would be more prone to VALUE religious freedom.[/quote]\n By your logic, a white person wouldn't value color as much as a black person or another non-white race.\n I've already explained why atheists would be more apt to value religious freedom. You don't even try to refute that.\n Religious freedom means we ALL get to believe what we want. That's not really affected just because one person's beliefs can be summed up in \"I don't believe God exists\".\n \n \n \nIf you're gay, for instance, you're probably going to have a better sense of the need for gay rights in terms of personal experience and being able to PERSONALLY identify with it.\n\n The number of people who support gay marriage, who happen to be straight, FAR OUTNUMBER the people who are gay.\n The number of people who support black equality, who happen to be white, FAR OUTNUMBER the number of black people.\n \n If a politician demonstrates that they will support gay rights, even if he is straight, he has my confidence on that issue.\n I have no pretense that a straight person would not be able to understand or represent gay equality.\n \n \n \nOf course not, but as I'm not an atheist, why should I be expected to vote with that being a significant factor OVER the concerns of religious people?\n\n You're not voting for the politician for pope!\n You're voting for him for public office!\n And I'm still waiting on you to give ANY REAL example of how an atheist is inherently deficient.\n I've got your \"opinion\", but quite frankly your repeated refusal to admit you don't know any atheists puts you as a clearly unqualified judge of what \"atheists\" as a group, are like.\n \n You don't seem to get that this poll DID NOT ask \"would you vote for an atheist who didn't like Christianity\".\n No. It asked \"would you vote for an atheist\", and PEOPLE PUT THEIR OWN ASSUMPTIONS as to what that meant.\n \n \n \nIt's normal and ACCEPTABLE for people to vote based on what they think a candidate will do for the concerns THEY have.\n\n I guess the repetitive method is going to have to come into play.\n WHAT CONCERN do you have that an atheist won't represent?\n WHAT CONCERN do you have that an atheist won't represent?\n WHAT CONCERN do you have that an atheist won't represent?\n \n \n \nAnd that reality explains the poll result that you're trying to imply bias over. It IS bias, but it's completely normal and acceptable bias.\n\n How can you call it \"reality\" WHEN YOU DO NOT KNOW any atheists???\n It's the same junk as when a racist pretends to \"know\" what black people are like, or an anti-semite pretends to \"know\" what Jews are like....\n \n \n \nObviously, as an atheist, you don't give religious peoples' concerns much concern--you downplay then when you can and if the priority if religious freedom is brought up, you switch to atheists being in \"more danger\" in that regard. You've done that right here in this thread!\n\n What supreme horse doody!\n When the \"religious peoples' concern\" is \"How can I put my religion into government\", I OPPOSE that. NO RELIGION gets to play politics.\n For REAL religious discrimination, I am opposed to it.\n \n I just don't agree with the pretense that Christians are victims as much as they like to pretend they are!\n \n And regarding \"atheists being in more danger\", THEY ARE.\n You're just whining cause you're wrong, and I don't share your opinion.\n If what this REALLY boils down to is that atheists won't be a part of the Christian attempt to exert political power in Washington, then that SHOULD BE opposed!\n \n \n \nAn atheist may indeed believe the concerns of religious people are valid, but you can't be serious in expecting a religious person to vote for an atheist candidate over a religious one (typically, unless one is a nutcase of some kind) when religious freedom is something they consider a priority.\n\n Again, all a person has to do is substitute \"religion\" with \"race\" or \"gender\" or any other issue of discrimination.\n It's funny how I seem to remember you trying to deride gays for voting based JUST on the \"gay issue\".\n But here, you show that EXACT mentality in spades.\n \n The president's Christian.\n Congress is predominantly Christian.\n I would be really surprised if any of the SCOTUS judges were not Christian.\n But in your mind, your religious freedom is \"threatened\"...\n Paranoia Supreme!",

   "I notice you make a distinction between personal rejection of religion and rejection to the point of being able to represent it. Quite frankly, I've never dialogued with an atheist (and I have dialogued with quite a few of them) that wouldn't rather see a religion-free world. That's just the reality of the situation. Why should I vote for a way of thinking that would rather have such a world, when religion is important to me?\n\n Seriously, you don't REALLY get what people's REAL positions are when they explain them to you.\n Case in point, your categorization of my opinion.\n \n If an atheist politician voiced a desire for a \"religion-free world\", I would have no problem seeing others not vote for him.\n \n But once again, we're talking about people who have unilaterally stated that they WILL NOT vote for an atheist.\n You'll note that the question does NOT come with any of the qualifiers you have discussed. It didn't specify that the atheist was against religion.\n However, I suspect that a good number of the respondents improperly presumed that...\n \n \n \nSo are gays who refuse to vote for a conservative Christian, Foundit.\n\n If by \"conservative Christian\" you are trying to institute code for \"anti-gay\", then I would refuse as well.\n But if you allow for the existence of conservative Christians who BELIEVE in gay equal rights, like I believe some do, I would have no problem voting for that person.\n \n Most people talk about refusing to vote for a person who is against gay rights, and the \"conservative Christian\" is a secondary related issue, but not the primary reason involved.\n \n \n \nSo are veterans who would not vote for a draft dodger.\n\n Quite frankly, that is more of a morality issue. A person broke the law.\n \n \n \nSo are senior citizens who would not vote for a 35 year-old candidate (because they believe experience is important enough issue to do so).\n\n And that boils down to capability in office.\n They believe he may be less capable because of his age.\n But would you get the same reaction for a very experienced person who might be a little younger, like 35? Probably not.\n \n \n \nThat you take ONLY examples that are malevolent and try to associate it with what I'm saying doesn't show anything, Foundit. This is NORMAL and ACCEPTED thing, regardless WHAT the issue at play is.\n\n Your first example needed refining, because I don't believe gays don't have a problem with Christians who are not interested in picking fights in the first place.\n Your second example involved a law-breaker.\n Your third should revolve more around the \"experience\" as opposed to the age itself. (Otherwise, that would be age-ism)\n \n What I find as \"malevolent\" is that a question was asked about whether or not a person would vote for an atheist.\n Not \"would you vote for a cross-burning atheist\" or \"an atheist who dislikes christianity\", but rather JUST AN ATHEIST.\n The stereo-typing is malevolent.\n \n \n \nThis is fascinating. Three times in your response you used such an example, when in fact there is no reason to do that--we aren't talking about discriminatory religious people here\n\n Aren't we?\n Even though there were NO qualifiers in that poll, and based JUST on knowing the guy is an atheist, these voters would say \"No!\"\n They didn't need any more information, other than that ONE bit about being atheist.\n \n \n \nWhy not use a BENIGN example?\n\n The problem is in how you neuter the issue of its heart.\n Voters who ONLY know the guy is atheist, and they say \"no\".\n \n The people in the poll DO NOT EVEN KNOW the person's POLITICAL stance on religion, but they said \"no\" regardless.\n \n I am using similar examples, where ONE characteristic, and NO follow-on knowledge, provides an automatic \"No\" vote.\n That's prejudice!\n \n \n \nBecause only someone who brings prejudice to a situation to begin with would use the worse examples they could think of when we are talking about religious people GENERALLY and the tendency of people to vote for a candidate they feel best understands their priorities.\n\n No.\n YOU are trying to talk about that, ignoring the fact that the poll didn't even bring up the person's \"priorities\" or \"tendencies\".\n \n \n \nAnd frankly, these two issues should never have even been PUT with the issue of atheism. Because I am WELL aware of the reasons some religious people don't vote for atheists, and it's a different matter than a white person refusing to vote for someone because he's black .... atheism and religion are in the realm of THE WAY PEOPLE THINK and their IDEOLOGY.\n\n Which brings me back to the earlier example.\n Do you think blacks see the world like whites do?\n Do you think women see the world like men do?\n \n Different groups DO THINK differently. It's not identical.\n The point is that WHERE IT COUNTS, in this area we are talking about POLITICS, it's their POLITICAL views that are important.\n What they will actually do in government.\n \n \n \nI think the more pertinent question is whether or not a religious person would better be able to understand and identify with atheists enough to represent them as eagerly. Do YOU think so? 'Cause frankly I think not, and I think not the OTHER direction too.\n\n Again, WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?\n What political action will the atheist take that will be different from the Christian, to the degree that a person will say \"No\" to the atheist based JUST on the fact that he's an atheist?\n \n What political action will the Christian take that the atheist will not be represented by?\n \n You've got extremists on both ends, that BOTH sides want to keep out.\n But NONE of the \"extremes\" epitomize the group to the degree that the whole group is invalidated.\n \n \n \nhttp://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/downey_24_4.htm\n\n Thanks for posting that.\n I was going to go look for some more, cause it appears some people just don't seem to get that the CHRISTIAN MAJORITY is not the real victim here...",

There are many atheists who are clearly ANTI-religion--it's not like they're being neutral on the matter and taking a live-and-let-live approach. Unfortunately for atheists, the internet--the blogs, the organizations, the websites, people right here in forums and chatrooms like this like e.g. Lesz and the like, etc.---has made a big difference in people being able to see that many atheists aren't just stopping at \"I don't believe in religion\", but actively saying it's a BAD thing and that society would be better off without it. Religious people now KNOW of atheists considering their views delusional. (The Dawkins approach.) The cat is out of the bag, my friend, it's offensive, and I don't blame people ONE BIT for wanting to vote against it. I think that's exactly WHY people would be less inclined to vote for someone who's an atheist.\n \n \nAgain, WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?What political action will the atheist take that will be different from the Christian, to the degree that a person will say \"No\" to the atheist based JUST on the fact that he's an atheist?\n\n \n It's an issue of DEGREE. Which do you think would be more likely to CARE in the first place, Foundit? You've been minimizing the protections religion needs YOURSELF right here in these forums, by answering that point with the usual \"but atheists need it worse!\" as if anyone has argued they don't. This is just like any other issue--I'm sure there are issues needed MORE than protecting gun rights, but I'm not likely to vote for a candidate who takes no stance on guns or even doesn't like them, because the candidate who takes no stance on them or doesn't like them wouldn't likely be as eager and likely to protect gun rights as a candidate who DOES like them. What you're doing is like saying gun-rights proponents--for whom that issue is a BIG DEAL--should vote for a candidate who doesn't enjoy guns just as eagerly as someone who does. And the reasons you give is that \"there are other rights MORE in danger out there that that.\" It's silly. People are going to vote for what is important to them, and you can't realistically expect people to vote for an atheist candidate over a religious one if religion is very dear to them. Come on.\n \n \nThanks for posting that.\n I was going to go look for some more, cause it appears some people just don't seem to get that the CHRISTIAN MAJORITY is not the real victim here...\n\n \n Oh yeah ... from a website that calls itself the \"Council for Secular Humanism.\" emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nTranslation?\n Jyoshu is going to ignore a LOT of what I said, including this question he KEEPS DODGING...\n \n WHAT CONCERN do you have that an atheist won't represent?\n WHAT CONCERN do you have that an atheist won't represent?\n WHAT CONCERN do you have that an atheist won't represent?\n \n Still. NO Answer...\n\n \n I already dealt with this too ... I'll do it one more time for you, and that's it.\n \n The concern isn't that they WON'T represent at all. You're not getting it. The point is that the religious person would likely give greater CONCERN to protecting religious people than would someone who thinks religion is all just \"cockamamie\" and bunch of hooey. I'm sorry, but you're not going to convince anyone that an atheist would be as EAGER to protect religious people as a religious person would. Now, if I have a choice between an atheist person who says he'll protect religious people, and a religious person who says he'll protect religious people and who IDENTIFIES with it, why should I vote for the atheist???\n \n Now, don't use one of your BLOWI's here and claim I haven't answered this again. Because I have. THAT'S the answer.\n \n \nI don't know why you are trying to run this into the ground when you are convincing NOONE.\n\n \n Foundit, I've got nothing I need to convince anyone of. YOU'RE[/B] the one making the premise here, that people don't vote for athiests out of intolerance, or prejudice, or whatever you think the horrible reasons are. Nice attempt at trying to deflect your burden of proof, though.

THAT'S what you aren't getting about this whole thing. Religion/atheism is ideological stuff that people can and sometimes do change their minds on. Being white or black has to do with a person's traits. Apples and oranges here. Prejudice against a viewpoint is saying \"no, I don't accept that viewpoint.\" Prejudice against a black person is saying \"I don't accept that PERSON.\" Do you really not understand the difference here, and therefore why there's a HUGE difference? You're trying to play this up like it's something on the order of racism or something to that effect; it's NOT. It's people who don't agree with a given ideology. And that's NORMAL part of the process. Honestly, this is just not something you should be getting all worked up over. People do this ALL the time, and it's considered acceptable to not vote for someone espousing a view you don't agree with, particularly if it's a MAJOR issue to that voter.",

   "The very fact it DIDN'T come with qualifiers, and puts an ideological issue in with such issues as voting for people based on race should be HUGE red flag concerning the poll. \n\n I don't see how you can say that.\n Suppose the question stated \"Would you vote for a ____?\"\n A person who realized that a ____ could think in manner A, or in manner B, would answer the question YES.\n Note, the question is not \"would you ALWAYS vote for a ____?\", but rather \"WOULD you...\"\n To answer no demonstrates unilateral exclusion, regardless of the circumstances.\n To answer yes demonstrates a situation where somebody could vote, but an obvious interpretation would show that it wouldn't mean that the statement is always universal. Obviously there are some circumstances which could eliminate that vote, but JUST BEING _____ is NOT one of those circumstances.\n \n I don't know why you don't get that.\n A lack of qualifiers demonstrates THE MOST EXTREME level of prejudice.\n The answer IS NOT predicated on ____ and also believes YYY. The answer \"No\" involves the person JUST being ____.\n \n \n \nFrankly, you're whitewashing and watering down atheism as it often plays out in our culture today.\n\n Malarky!\n You are assuming the worst out of the situation.\n Do you realize that about 1% of our nation is atheist. That means 3 MILLION atheists.\n How often do you hear of atheists causing problems?\n I will admit it has a good frequency, cause the news LOVES TO REPORT such problems.\n But HOW MANY ATHEISTS are actually involved?\n Take the father of the little girl who wanted to get \"under God\" removed from the Pledge of Allegiance.\n ONE GUY.\n \n Most atheists don't make a fuss.\n I am \"whitewashing\" nothing.\n If you want to talk about \"whitewashing\", you should see some of your own posts trying to ignore the impact of some Christians...\n \n \n \nAtheism these days is not that benign--the Chris Hitchen-sorts are out of bag. There are many atheists who are clearly ANTI-religion--it's not like they're being neutral on the matter and taking a live-and-let-live approach.\n\n 3 MILLION atheists Jyoshu.\n HOW many is \"many\"?\n It's actually a rarity in the bunch. Not the majority. Not even a large percentage.\n \n \n \nUnfortunately for atheists, the internet--the blogs, the organizations, the websites, people right here in forums and chatrooms like this like e.g. Lesz and the like, etc.---has made a big difference in people being able to see that many atheists aren't just stopping at \"I don't believe in religion\", but actively saying it's a BAD thing and that society would be better off without it.\n\n Again, how many?\n And HOW MUCH of that criticism exists SOLELY with atheists?\n You've got Christians making some of the SAME OBSERVATIONS about what is wrong with the situation.\n Should we start condemning Christians for being anti-religious as well?\n \n \n \nThe cat is out of the bag, my friend, it's offensive, and I don't blame people ONE BIT for wanting to vote against it. I think that's exactly WHY people would be less inclined to vote for someone who's an atheist.\n\n STOP DOING THAT.\n The question was not \"less inclined\".\n The question demonstrated that people saying \"No\" WOULD NOT vote for the individual involved.\n \n YOUR posts are demonstrating some of the ASSUMPTIONS that people are making to justify the vote.\n But all you're doing is providing the STEREO-TYPES which would lead to such prejudice in the first place.\n \n If you don't want to vote for an atheist who wants to eliminate religion, that's great! I wouldn't either.\n But the point is that MOST atheists are NOT LIKE THAT, and you are stereo-typing in trying to justify the prejudice demonstrated in this poll...\n \n \n \nIt's an issue of DEGREE. Which do you think would be more likely to CARE in the first place, Foundit?\n\n Why do you ask questions I have already answered.\n The ATHEIST would be more inclined to protect freedom of religion, cause the ATHEIST receives more REAL discrimination than the Christian.\n \n And another thing, don't you criticize gays if they decide their vote SOLELY on the gay issue?\n But here, you are trying to justify Christians based on an issue of DEGREE!\n \n Not a situation where \"John is for gay adoption, and Mark is against\", but rather an UNNAMED ISSUE (which you continue to refuse to name) on which you CLAIM a \"degree\" of difference in the candidates' position.\n \n \n \nYou've been minimizing the protections religion needs YOURSELF right here in these forums, by answering that point with the usual \"but atheists need it worse!\" as if anyone has argued they don't.\n\n No Jyoshu.\n NOT \"as if anyone has argued they don't\".\n But rather to demonstrate that they DO need it more, cause you don't seem to get that.\n \n \n \nThis is just like any other issue--I'm sure there are issues needed MORE than protecting gun rights, but I'm not likely to vote for a candidate who takes no stance on guns or even doesn't like them, because the candidate who takes no stance on them or doesn't like them wouldn't likely be as eager and likely to protect gun rights as a candidate who DOES like them. What you're doing is like saying gun-rights proponents--for whom that issue is a BIG DEAL--should vote for a candidate who doesn't enjoy guns just as eagerly as someone who does.\n\n It's funny you argue \"as if anyone has argued they don't\", and then follow up with this...\n Atheists DO EAGERLY utilize \"freedom of religion\" cause they need it's protection more.\n \n I don't know what this \"doesn't enjoy guns\" junk is about, cause the UNDERLYING ISSUE is protection of the fundamental right of freedom to religion.\n And that, even as you state, you aren't trying to argue against.\n \n \n \nAnd the reasons you give is that \"there are other rights MORE in danger out there that that.\" It's silly. People are going to vote for what is important to them, and you can't realistically expect people to vote for an atheist candidate over a religious one if religion is very dear to them. Come on.\n\n It's not an issue of \"expectation\".\n Christianity has overcome some prejudice.\n But I see some very large issues that they clearly have a LOT of prejudice in the closet for.\n \n \n \nOh yeah ... from a website that calls itself the \"Council for Secular Humanism.\" emoticon_rolleyes\n\n Another \"attacking the messenger\" from you?\n I guess I'll have to remember that for a future date.\n And I can't help but notice you completely refuse to actually address the points made therein.\n \n Let me guess.\n They are ATHEIST so you disregard, right? emoticon_rolleyes\n You're proving my point...\n \n \n \nI already dealt with this too ... I'll do it one more time for you, and that's it.\n The concern isn't that they WON'T represent at all. You're not getting it. The point is that the religious person would likely give greater CONCERN to protecting religious people than would someone who thinks religion is all just \"cockamamie\" and bunch of hooey.\n\n This is patently amazing!\n I point out that atheists are MORE IN NEED of \"freedom of religion\" protection, and you DO NOT EVEN TRY to contradict.\n But then you turn around and proclaim that they would be LESS inclined to \"protecting\" because they aren't religious.\n \n In this country, I think there are a LOT of statements from anti-gays that are just plain HARMFUL.\n BUT, I support their first amendment right to say them.\n \n I guess when it comes to atheists, you are much more closed-minded.\n \n \n \nI'm sorry, but you're not going to convince anyone that an atheist would be as EAGER to protect religious people as a religious person would.\n\n No.\n I am not going to convince you cause you already have assumed another person's position, and extrapolated it onto 3 million people.\n Common example of prejudice...\n \n \n \nFoundit, I've got nothing I need to convince anyone of. YOU'RE the one making the premise here, that people don't vote for athiests out of intolerance, or prejudice, or whatever you think the horrible reasons are. Nice attempt at trying to deflect your burden of proof, though. Saw right through it.\n\n Jyoshu, you PROVE my point.\n You just don't realize it...\n \n \n \nI've already shown you how those are different than this--they aren't ideological issues.\n\n I've already shown how your claim is wrong.\n A black person DOES have ideological differences from a white person.\n Do you really think that a white person is going to fight as hard for racial discrimination legislation, as opposed to a black person WHO HAS LIVED IT???\n You can find proof of that too throughout history. The LEADERS in the fight against racial discrimination are BLACK, aren't they...\n \n How about women? Do they think identically to a man? Or are there ideological differences?\n I've already addressed this.\n \n \n \nPrejudice against a viewpoint is saying \"no, I don't accept that viewpoint.\" Prejudice against a black person is saying \"I don't accept that PERSON.\"\n\n And prejudice against a group of people who have a viewpoint is saying \"no, I don't accept them based on them being atheists\".\n \n \n \nDo you really not understand the difference here, and therefore why there's a HUGE difference? You're trying to play this up like it's something on the order of racism or something to that effect; it's NOT.\n\n A LOT of time when people try to minimize the comparison between different discriminations and prejudice, they'll ignore the similarities and come up with thoroughly arbitrary observations and assumptions to try and justify a pretense of a difference.\n Jyoshu, do you REALLY THINK that a racist looks at a black person and thinks \"that person is identical to me, but just different skin color that I don't like\".\n NO. Like you, they come up with some \"reason\" that they are different. Stereo-types like blacks are lazy or stupid or thieves.\n IDEOLOGICAL claims associated to the entire group.\n \n What YOU don't seem to get is that the UNDERLYING MECHANISM is the same.\n The person involved makes some SWEEPING generalization, and proclaims the group \"inferior\" or \"subordinate\" because of their assumptions.\n \n \n \nHonestly, this is just not something you should be getting all worked up over. People do this ALL the time, and it's considered acceptable to not vote for someone espousing a view you don't agree with, particularly if it's a MAJOR issue to that voter.\n\n And misogynists claim \"a view\" that women will be weaker in politics. They aren't as \"strong\".\n And racists claim that blacks have \"a view\" of being morally deficient or lazy.\n \n If a person had \"a view\" that he liked oranges and not apples, would we think that apple growers should feel threatened?\n NO. Cause that view is probably simply just related to PERSONAL DIET. The guy involved is not going to raise apple taxes more than others.\n You are taking the PERSONAL view, and ASSUMING a political action based on that.",

   "In the United States, all decisions are made by the majority. The minority is allowed a voice, however the majority rules. The other fact is that we are a Christian nation. Our main religious affiliation is Christianity. As long as the United States is run in this manner, those with the minority belief will more than likely lose out.\n \n I would also like to say that of course atheists, CAN and DO vote for Christians...They don't have many other options, I don't think I've ever heard of an atheist running for public office. There's no real proof that they wouldn't be elected. No one ever thought we would have an African American president and we soon will. Just saying the possiblities are out there.\n\n \n I suspect plenty of unbelievers have successfully run for office, though in a nation with so many religious bigots living in it, they probably adopt protective coloration. But no, I do not really agree the reason we atheists vote for believers in election is because we have no other choice -- we could choose not to vote, after all, if we felt no religious believer could represent us. Or we could take a risk and stand for office ourselves. It's because we do not believe that a candidate's religion is necessarily relevant to their performance as a representative of the people in what is, after all, a constitutionally secular, as opposed to theocratic, state. It is not likely, for example, that a person's religion is going to cloud their judgement on how much money to spend on highway maintenance, for example. \n \n Obviously, activist religious believers like jyosh feel very differently about that, and believe that a person's religious views decide their fitness for public office. That attitude does not bode well for a secular republic, and one has to hope that there aren't a majority of religious believes as prejudiced as that.\n \n Still, I would acknowledge that if a person's religious views were so strong that they would seek to introduce an element of theocracy into the secular state, then I do not think an atheist could vote for them in good conscience. One might as well put a gun to one's head and pull the trigger.\n \n I recall there are examples of avowed atheists running for and being elected to office, though not to any major office to my knowledge -- which is why I can't report examples because they were too minor to stick in my mind. However, religion is probably not too great a factor in many campaigns. Not all candidates are religious zealots, and even many of the ones who are breast-beatingly religious do not all take that religion too seriously in their personal lives. It's often that they have a cynical view of the stupidity of the average religious voter, one that greatly over-estimates their actual stupidity.\n \n I think that the recent US election is in part evidence of that cynical over-estimation, where not a few Republicans who ran on overtly Christianist platforms lost their rhetorical heads and actual seats in Congress. Voters were, in some part, sick to death of the religious posturing and extremism of the Republicans over the last decade, though that wasn't the only reason the GOP got trounced. It was still a significant part of the recipe for the GOP defeat.\n \n Still, the evidence of prejudice against atheists in the US is overwhelming. From public examples such as the first president Bush, who openly said he doubted if atheists could be real Americans and jack-asses like VP candidate Palin who said much the same thing, to harassment of atheists in Christian communities, there is a lot of evidence that many religious Americans feel, at best, uncomfortable with people who do not share their beliefs, and at worst, violently hostile.",

I think that the British history of religious conflict, with many lives lost as a result of the rivalry between Catholics and Protestants following the Reformation, has a lot to do with that. We know the hard price of mixing religion and politics, and it's part of every child's history lessons.\n \n Then too, in pockets of Britain, there remains considerable religious rivalry, though at present this seems to be restricted mostly to football teams. A city such aas Glasgow, for example, has a lot of strife caused by religion to this day. ANd now with a growing Muslim population, there's a new reason for religious conflict. It's no longer just between the Cathies and the Proddies. Consequently, any pol who tries to pull some religious stunt is going to get instantly vilified as a bigot in the press. It's just asking for trouble.\n \n Lastly, like much of Western Europe, Britain has taken a secular trend of late, so much so that some former African colonies are now sending missionaries to Britain rather than the other way around!!! Gay marriage is all but a reality in Britain, with gay partnerships having virtually all the same rights as straight marriage where government benefits are concerned.\n \n One of the huge cultural changes I noticed directly on returning here after such a long time away was that people -- even those of my age, though there's a noticeable hesitation -- no longer referred to their \"husbands\" or \"wives\", but to their \"partners\". This is in part because so many heterosexuals now no longer get married, but just live together. This sort of thing is possible in a state with an adequate social umbrella for the poor, and where male and female economic equality is closer to reality. (No doubt, some folk will blame all that on gay marriage.) Much government language in legal statutes and government forms now follows this new habit.\n \n Perhaps if America had experienced religious strife of the intensity we've seen in Britain over the last few centuries, for longer than you guys have been a united nation -- occasional eruptions such as the Philadelphia book riots aside -- Americans would also be much more circumspect about mixing religion and politics. The Republicans are playing with fire for cynical and selfish political purposes, and hopefully, that's come back to bite their sorry asses.",

   "It is understandable one would want to vote for a candidate that shares one's own beliefs. It is universal. It is true for Jyoshu as it is for me and everyone here.\n \n I'm also certain that Jyoshu does not automatically eliminate atheists. Spoiled for choice in the USA, where every candidate loudly proclaims his christianity, this is easy. Of course, were he faced with an election where he'd get to vote only for a progressive atheist or an islamic fundamentalist, I'm sure he would counsider the candidates and vote for the one closer to his own preference.\n \n \n \n I would point out that this is self understood only in a country where christianity is predominant. Were Jyoshu in an environ where christianity were the minority, he would have felt what atheists (and other minority beliefs) feel in the USA.\n \n I would however like to point out something in the original post: What the original post shows is that people apply double standards. I bet the people who were so incensed at the idea of someone promoting atheism would not even understand why a preacher yelling \"Accept Jesus Christ as your savior to avoid hellfire!\" at a street corner would bother others. \n \n Perhaps it would be nice if these people were to spend some time as a minority, just so they would understand what it feels like.

   "Could some please give me a brief explanation of what it means to be an atheist? I think this information would help me to clarify some of the arguments that have been made.\n\n \n It just means someone who lives in the absence of a belief in one or more deities. The BBC has what looks like a reasonable introductory website here: Atheism. Atheists may have various philosophies that replace religious ones. Perhaps the most religious among these would be atheistic forms of Buddhism. Non-religious versions include utilitarianism, secular humanism, rationalism, etc.\n \n Essentially, though obviously there are many differences among atheists, anyone who calls him or herself an atheist is making a relatively strong statement about their belief that god definitely or probably does not exist, or at least that the sort of god religious believers worship does not exist. Therefore, they find their ethical systems to rationalise human behaviour in places other than religious scripture. Since there is only a limited set of rules that permit the organisation of stable human societies, in the end, there isn't much difference between the core values of atheists and theists where decent human behaviour is concerned. The differences lie on the periphery, and the justifications used to rationalise goodness, but they are all based on versions of the Golden Rule.\n \n Atheists take pleasure in rationalism, and do not need the comforts, such as they are, of religion. They find fulfillment in the search for knowledge, rather than seeking or basking in the alleged approval of some deity. Many atheists consider religion a delusional self-indulgence, a crutch to help believers deal with existential angst resulting from the short life-span of individual humans, and the pain and suffering of a mortal life.\n \n Consequently, although there isn't much difference between the core morality of theists and atheists (they are both human, therefore more alike than unalike), there are differences in their existential outlook. Atheists do not, as a rule, believe in life eternal or survival after death. They recognise that whatever it is we are as persons perishes with our deaths. Therefore, they place greater value on present life, and do not give any thought to some mythical afterlife for which there is no evidence. Some of us believe this is a great relief, not to have to worry about some great Nanny in the sky waiting to punish us for our misbehaviour. We pay for our sins in the here and now, and do not have to wait till we are dead and gone.",

I feel that the only explanation is that something had to create one or the other for the other to exist. \n \n I realize this is off the religious tolerance topic, and as I said simply a question of curiousity, not an attack of anyone's beliefs.\n\n \n Well, I must admit I didn't go through that BBC website with a fine-tooth comb. Where did you see a section that says \"science explains everything\"?\n \n I think you will find atheists believe there is a rational explanation for everything -- in other words, that everything has a natural explanation, whether we currently understand it or not. They may or may not believe that humans have sufficient rationality to understand everything that can be explained rationally. (Personally, I suspect there are matters that may be beyond human reason, but I do not hold that as an article of faith, merely as a possibility that I have no reason to discount.)\n \n However, no atheist believes that science currently \"explains everything\". Science and reason are works in progress. We understand more now than we ever did, and as a consequence have a larger appreciation of our areas of ignorance than we ever had before.\n \n As to the question of ultimate origins, most atheists have no problems admitting that science doesn't know all the answers yet. We do not even have a problem admitting that science might never know all the answers. One of the differences between atheists and theists is that when atheists come to some gap in human knowledge, we do not automatically assume that \"god\" must fill it. \n \n We do not assume that god's twitchy fingers have to stitch together what natural law cannot do for itself. We do not assume that just because we do not currently understand something, therefore it must have a divine explanation. Science has in large part been the process of filling in the gaps that previous generations had assigned to their deity. Atheists treat these merely as gaps in knowledge that may, at some point, be filled through the use of reason. But we are not dismayed if they are not, because there are always limits to current reasoning ability.\n \n After all, if we simply assumed the gap is filled by god, why bother to attempt to understand it at all? Atheism is a view that is open to exploration, open to new knowledge. It adjusts its view of the universe based not on dogma, but on scientific empiricism. Once, the universe was thought to be static and steady state; now, it is believed to be expanding. Atheism has no trouble adjusting, because atheism accepts that human knowledge changes and improves. It's religion that has issues with folk like that Galileo chap, not atheism.\n \n That in itself is a major difference between atheism and religious faith.",

I think it's enough that an atheist candidate wouldn't be able to identify with religious people enough. And I think you're making entirely too much of this.\n\n Do you even recognize how prejudice works in the first place?\n It often involves stereo-types. Beliefs about the minority, based often on ignorance, which provides the prejudiced person with excuses to help justify his prejudice.\n And oh yeah. Typically, the prejudiced person refuses to admit to his prejudice in the first place. They make up excuses as to why their \"distinction\" is separate from other prejudices they can admit to, because they don't share them...\n \n The mechanism for the prejudice involves an ideological characteristic.\n But it's an ideological issue on RELIGION which is separate from POLITICS, yet you entangle the two.\n \n I have repeatedly asked you \"WHAT CONCERN do you have that an atheist won't represent?\". You have answered the question with an incredibly vague response that refuses to explain any SPECIFIC concern involved.\n Religious legislation? Already prohibited by separation of church and state, established by predominantly religious founding fathers.\n Religious freedom? I've already explained why atheists would be more interested in protecting religious freedom. They have more need for it.\n \n This is an issue of prejudice. For reasons you cannot even explicitly put into words, a great many Christians refuse to vote for atheists AT ALL.\n Naturally, you rush to defend by attempting to rephrase the issue inaccurately, but refusing to vote AT ALL for a qualified candidate just because of one characteristic?\n \n For a comparison, I would never dream of withholding a vote from a Christian just because he's Christian. MOST non-Christians, including atheists, are like that.\n We look at SPECIFIC ISSUES in our votes.\n \n \n \nBelittling religion and associating it with ignorance IS causing problems--it's inherently insulting.\n\n When the shoe fits...\n And when history has shown the shoe being worn as such...\n \n I think part of the problem for you Jyoshu is that you complain about such observations, and try to give excuses for it like *but they really believe what they're saying*, but you habitually REFUSE TO CORRECT the situation.\n It's like a parent having a child that is wearing dog poo. Most parents would immediately remove it and tell the child not to do it.\n You would tell others that the dog poo has some involvement in the child's \"beliefs\", and try to correct anybody who commented on the issue but REFUSE to actually address the issue yourself.\n \n But for the record, you're wrong about \"belittling religion and associating it with ignorance\". Quite frankly, just because people have abused the issue of religion does not mean that the underlying item is somehow diminished in what it represents.\n \n \n \nSo do you actually think most atheist don't really agree with that one guy?\n\n There is a difference inbetween \"agreement\" and actually CAUSING the problem.\n Quite frankly, I think the guy is right. Separation of church and state clearly means that we shouldn't have our government involved in endorsing God.\n But that doesn't mean I also don't recognize how the guy's actions are wrong.\n \n And nice attempt to move the goal-posts. Instead of pointing to atheists who are \"causing problems\", you have created an environment where you want the issue to be people who are sympathetic to the issue.\n \n \n \nWell then, what's your problem here? If that's the case what are you worried about? Frankly, I don't think you quite realise that atheism by it's very nature isn't open to religion.\n\n An atheist, IN HIS PERSONAL BELIEFS, is not open to religion.\n It's the separation between personal and political that is the issue you refuse to comprehend.\n \n As a Christian, are you \"by your very nature, open to atheism\"?\n \n \n \nIf a person doesn't agree that religion should exist in their OWN life, they naturally aren't going to think that it's best to be in society either.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n It's Christmas time. I see a few people decorating their houses in incredibly gaudy manner. I think it's tacky. I don't think it's what is best for our neighborhood.\n But by the same token, I do not RESTRICT them in their efforts. It's their personal prerogative.\n \n More and more, I think the response to this issue is positively Freudian. I think you come from a place where your ACTUAL religious beliefs are so inherently tied to your religion, and the implications of such are present in your POLITICAL actions, that you assume others do the same.\n If I came across a Christian who believed homosexuality was a sin, yet that politician professed support for equal rights for gays, I would support that politician.\n To me, if I were to categorically withhold my vote for him, that would also be a sign of prejudice. ASSUMING that he would not support gay equal rights based SOLELY on knowing \"he's Christian\" would be prejudice.\n \n Furthermore, \"best to be in society\"?\n emoticon_rolleyes\n What do you think that means POLITICALLY?\n Atheist nazis going to toss religious freedom out of the first amendment?\n \n \n \nAtheism is closed to the idea that religion is valid. How could it NOT be \"like that\"?\n\n Are you open to atheism being valid? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n I think the root issue is that you TAKE this too personally.\n A person doesn't believe like you, and isn't open to being converted to believing like you, and that somehow makes him an inferior political candidate?\n I think it would be miraculous if Christians could live in the shoes of the people they discriminate against for a year.\n Heck, maybe even just for Spurlock's \"30 Days\".\n Maybe then your eyes could open.\n \n \n \nNope. That's freedom FROM religion.\n\n Freedom \"from\" religion is part of freedom \"of\" religion.\n And if you think \"freedom from religion\" is the only part they celebrate, you're deluding yourself.\n \n \n \nFoundit, don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about. Because frankly, you do.\n\n Jyoshu, I KNOW what you're talking about.\n I RECOGNIZE your argument.\n \n I also recognize the FLAW in your argument. THAT is the issue at hand.\n \n \n \nYou act like atheists are BETTER equipped to defend rights, even RELGIOUS rights, than a religious person.\n\n Jyoshu, Atheism IS a religion.\n Atheists, ARE \"religious people\".\n \n \n \nThat's like saying that someone who doesn't value guns at all is BETTER equipped to defend 2nd amendment rights. Or it's like saying a straight person is going to better be able to identify with the feelings and issues of gay people rather than a gay person.\n\n You are ignoring my argument and ignoring the fact that atheism IS a religion that is MORE discriminated against.\n \n It would be more appropriate to say that if you had two racial colors, we'll go with maroon and sea-green, and the sea-green experienced MORE discrimination in society, while the maroon experienced just a little.\n Then I would say that while the sea-green is not \"maroon\", they would be MORE INCLINED to protect against racial prejudice based on their experience.\n \n \n \nFoundit, stop acting like you don't understand the distinction I'm pointing out to you, because I know you do. One is an issue of VIEWS. The other is an issue of intolerance toward SKIN COLOR. You know this.

The REASON may be tied to a \"skin color\", but that doesn't eliminate the EXISTENCE of the ideological difference.\n \"Stop acting like\" I am talking about \"intolerance towards skin color\" when the truth is that I am talking about an IDEOLOGICAL issue.",

You're assuming the article means people would not vote for someone BECAUSE they are an atheist, from the standpoint of prejudice toward them, and that's an UNFOUNDED assumption. Again, this is HOW this issue is different from that of voting for a black president. Atheism is a view people either agree with or they don't in terms of whether it is CORRECT or not. It's an \"I-agree-or-disagree-that's-true\" sort of issue. Prejudice isn't the issue here. (Unless of course, you're determined to read it into the situation!)

Christians shouldn't be criticized for voting against such a candidate.\n Your \"relevant example\" demonstrates, yet again, the stereo-type you present.\n \n \n [quoet=jyoshu]But your statement here reveals your real problem here. You're assuming the article means people would not vote for someone BECAUSE they are an atheist, from the standpoint of prejudice toward them, and that's an UNFOUNDED assumption.[/quote]\n Jyoshu, the ONLY bit of information that the polling populace had was \"he's generally well qualified, nominated by your party, and he happens to be ____\"\n \n What YOU are doing is adding window dressing. Adding STEREO-TYPES to help justify why the atheist would be voted against.\n It's apologetics.\n \n Do you think a racist comes out and says \"I will not vote for the black person just cause they are black\"?\n Or the misogynist \"I will not vote for the woman just cause they are a woman\"?\n No. They add on all sorts of other assumptions like \"the black candidate is lazy and shifty\" or \"the woman would not be as strong on her policies and she would be distracted by knitting\".\n \n \n \nAgain, this is HOW this issue is different from that of voting for a black president.\n\n The only real difference is that \"race\" is something inherent, and \"religion\" is something not inherent.\n Or, to get back to those articles that you kept tossing out there, maybe you should explain what your position is on all those \"Is God in your genes?\" articles?\n Cause it would seem that by posting those, you profess an the inherent nature of god vs no-god beliefs...\n \n \n \nAtheism is a view people either agree with or they don't in terms of whether it is CORRECT or not.\n\n So?\n People can \"agree\" or \"disagree\" on \"toilet seat up or down\". Or on \"apples\" or \"oranges\". Or on cats or dogs.\n But just cause a candidate likes cats over dogs doesn't mean we assume the candidate is automatically going to discriminate against dogs at the shelter, and try to do more advertising for cats. To AUTOMATICALLY STEREO-TYPE, based SOLELY on one bit of information, is ridiculous.\n \n But that is what you are doing. You take ONE bit of information as to \"atheist\" or \"not an atheist\", and you assume the rest.\n \n \n \nIt's an \"I-agree-or-disagree-that's-true\" sort of issue. Prejudice isn't the issue here.\n\n Yes. It is when you STEREO-TYPE the level of the \"disagreement\".\n All I am asking for is that people not ASSUME facts not in evidence.\n \n \n \n(Unless of course, you're determined to read it into the situation!)\n\n That accusation is funny coming from your position.\n In the poll, the info the question gave was \"well qualified person nominated by your party, who happens to be _______\"\n ALL of the rest of your defense of those using that ONE PIECE of information revolves around YOU READING INTO the situation.\n \n \n \nAnd since religion is a HUGE thing to many people, they're naturally going to likely vote for the candidate who will understand their concerns and needs better.\n\n And yet when pressed for an ACTUAL CONCERN involved, you cannot substantiate an example.\n If a black person said that a white person wouldn't be able to understand his concerns, that would be an extreme assumption.\n While the white person may not know what it feels like to walk through a department store suspected of robbery, the white person DOES recognize that as wrong. And the white person can be against the RACIAL PROFILING that epitomizes how it becomes a POLITICAL issue.\n \n Here, you insist that the atheist has to KNOW EVERYTHING about the Christian before he can represent, and you can't even present ACTUAL SUBSTANCE to a POLITICAL issue that the atheist would be deficient in.\n \n \n \nA true atheist wouldn't be open to religion ANYWHERE. How could they be?\n\n I'm not open to being straight.\n Do you think that means that I can't understand straight people wanting to live their straight lives?\n Again, you stereo-type...\n \n An atheist is expressing a belief in his PERSONAL life.\n You improperly extrapolate that onto actions onto other people's lives.\n \n \n \nJust to use a typical atheist-used example, it's like you're saying \"Oh, he's only not open to the idea of the tooth fairy PERSONALLY; it's not that way with society at large.\" \n\n What do you think your example means?\n Would the atheist fight against people telling their kid about \"the tooth fairy\"?\n Would the atheist automatically take out banners on the free-way saying \"tooth fairy is a myth\"?\n \n Again, you PERSONALLY have a dim view of atheism, and YOU are not open to atheism.\n Does that mean you would be more discriminatory or not as protective?\n \n \n \nI was talking about the nature of ATHEISM, not the nature of atheists.\n\n Considering we aren't talking about electing \"ATHEISM\", but rather a person who happens to be an atheist, your comment is meaningless.\n And you have avoided my question.\n As a Christian, are you \"by your very nature, open to atheism\"?\n It's a legitimate question. You talk about representation and atheists not being \"open\" to a god.\n I am showing you exactly how meaningless that correlation is.\n \n \n \n??? I have no idea what the heck this is supposed to mean. I can pretty much guarantee you most atheists would not want their views categorized as a religion, and I don't really agree with you that it is, either.\n\n religious: relating to or manifesting faithful devotion to an acknowledged ultimate reality or deity\n Atheists cling to an \"ultimate reality\" of a lack of a god.\n It's a religion, even if some don't want to admit it.",

   "Without any evidence other than knowing they are atheist, you categorize them as less capable or willing to protect religious beliefs.\n\n \n What can I say? I'm flabbergasted here. I'm sorry, but the idea that a person who was against religion would be MORE likely to protect religion than someone who valued religion is simply absurd.

Freedom from religion is a very REAL constitutional concept, just like freedom of religion (protecting it) is a very real constitutional concept. \"Freedom from religion\" is part of the basic concept put forth in the Establishment clause, that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion. It's what entitles you to be as unreligious as you want to be, and prevents the government from imposing religion on you. The Free Exercise clause on the other hand, protects religious people, and basically puts forth the concept of protecting religion. BOTH are very real concepts, and it's not a case of one being weak while the other is \"stronger.\" An atheist could fire a religious person just as easily as a religious person could fire an atheist. An employer could just as easily prevent an employee from a reasonable expression of his or her religion. For instance, there was a case a year or two ago that got out publicly where Bristish Airlines wouldn't let a Christian stewardess wear a small cross pendant on a necklace. Even though that's considered pretty generic jewelry these days, and even though the same airline was letting other religious people wear religious headwear. This stuff DOES happen. You just don't notice it as much because, frankly, it's not a issue that matters to you as much as other issues. \n \n \nNo.\n You have talked about reasons for why a person might be more inclined to vote \"Christian\" as opposed to \"atheist\", but as for an EXPLICIT demonstration as for why there is such a majority OUTRIGHT REFUSAL to entertain an atheist candidate, you have not.\n\n \n And those reasons might very well be WHY they aren't willing to vote for someone with atheist views--an atheist. You're looking at it and ASSUMING prejudice rather than considering that this might be a case of people believing one would be more eager to support them than the other. Why should someone who enjoys and wants to carry a gun to defend themselves vote for a James Brady? I would fully EXPECT them to say 'no, I wouldn't vote for a James Brady' no matter what.\n \n \nDo you think a racist comes out and says \"I will not vote for the black person just cause they are black\"?\n Or the misogynist \"I will not vote for the woman just cause they are a woman\"?\n\n \n Well look, if we're going to go on what people DON'T say rather than what they DO, then we could come up with all sorts of wild ideas. The very fact these religious people ARE coming out and saying they won't vote for atheists (when your examples are of those that wouldn't) should tell you it very well simply an issue that they can't ideologically support such a candidate. It's like asking an avid pro-choicer to be just as willing to vote for someone who is staunchly pro-life.\n \n Look, there are no accidental atheists. Atheism, by it's very nature of what it is, carries a certain type of intolerance. How can you not understand that? We aren't talking about AGNOSTICISM here. THAT would be a more live-or-let-live approach. Atheism quite simply isn't open to religion, and it's rather unconvincing for anyone to assert or imply that an atheist is going to be ok with religion EVERYWHERE ELSE when he personally thinks it's delusional and a crock of you-know-what. It's just really hard for me to blame anyone who won't vote for someone when they know that-given-someone thinks THEY are delusional and that the thing they hold dearest and sacred in their life is a bunch of bunk and associated with ignorance.

I do not believe you and your friends on these boards would be seriously unhappy if the US were a theocracy -- the Christianist kind, of course.\n \n That is one reason it's a good thing the GOP was trounced this election -- no more Scalias, Alitos, Thomases or Robertses added to the Supreme Court for a while.

You seem to be embracing some sort of apocalyptic vision here that one side has to destroy the other to survive. Life just isn't like that, unless you go out of your way to make it so.\n \n \nOh, and I think you've really gone off the deep end somewhat here in arguing that atheism is a religion.\n\n \n I'd never argue that the absence of religion is religion... that would be a logical contradiction: A = Not A.\n \n It does amuse me, though, that when the more than usually incoherent fundies try to attack atheism, the worst they can say of it, after making the not very insightful comment that it is godless, is that it is a religion! Apparently, they think it's insulting to say atheists are thinking religiously, without ever realising that this particular insult comes back and hits them right in the face. :)",

   "There you go again.\n STEREO-TYPING.\n An atheist says his PERSONAL belief is that there is no God.\n \n It is no more logical to say that is \"against religion\" as it is to say a gay person is \"against heterosexuality\"!\n THAT is the real analogy to your claim.\n \n Just because a person is an atheist does not make them \"against religion\".\n That's what you don't get...\n\n \n Foundit, can you find me ONE single atheist who is open to religious belief in his or her life? Just one? And then one that wouldn't rather see society be non-religious? Saying one doesn't believe in religion IS being 'not open' to it. You might as well be saying that we shouldn't say someone who doesn't believe in the big bang isn't open to it. They aren't, but we shouldn't say it that way? Is that what you're saying? You're making a distinction that isn't even really real. One IS the other. And going a step further, to think that an atheist wouldn't also rather see society holding to his view is ludicrous. \n \n \nNo, Jyoshu, I notice it. I am not claiming Christian discrimination does not exist.\n I could add a few more items, as well. There is a \"Christmas\" document in some northern (west coast I think) state where it states on governmental property \"there is no god\", amongst other statements.\n \n I think it's more an issue where YOU don't notice the ATHEIST discrimination happening.\n Christians make up 75% of this population.\n Atheists? A measly 1%.\n Do you really think there are 75 times more discrimination stories for Christians than atheists? \n\n \n Well then what's the problem here? Why are you so concerned about this? Gee, a group of people believe a particular issue is important, even though there are issues of greater instance out there of something else or other things than their issue. You might as well be asking coal minders in WVA to not take an \"I'll-never-vote-for-an-anticoal-candidate\" approach just because there are other issues out there. That's the issue important to THEM, Foundit. People are naturally going to make their decisions on voting based on what's important to THEM, more than other things. You seem to think we should all be some completely altruistic voters and put other issues ahead of what issues WE feel is important. I think that's an unreasonable expectation to put on people. For most ANY issue, there's always going to be SOME issue out there that's more pressing.\n \n \nYou ASSUME them to be unsupportive.\n You STEREO-TYPE them as being \"against religion\".\n Stereo-typing the entire group, and discrimination based on that stereo-type, is the very heart of \"prejudice\".\n \n A) Bill Maher thinks \"religious\" people are \"delusional\".\n NOT all atheists.\n \n B) Quite frankly, don't you have a reciprocal view when it comes to atheists?\n For one, on the issue of \"ignorance\" and \"delusional\". Archie has repeated some of those very same sentiments. Your bible has as well.\n \n\n \n So ... you're saying most atheists have no problem with religion? They're open to it? Even though they find it irrational or demonstrating a lack of reason, and that they wouldn't rather have reason carry the day in society? I really think you don't have a realistic picture of the situation.\n \n The REASON atheists aren't religious, Foundit, is that they believe it is delusional or demonstrates ignorance and lack of reason. Show me ONE atheist who doesn't think that religion demonstrates lack of reason. Just one. And I'll gladly concede the point. Bill Mayer seems to be a typical atheist in his VIEWS. He just happens to be an outspoken one who has the ability to reach a lot of people. None of this is stereoptyping. It's observation, frankly. Take Lesz for example--he's gone to great lengths to argue faith means a lack of reason.\n \n \nJames Brady has EXPLICITLY STATED HIS POLITICAL POSITION. We're talking about atheists who have NEVER STATED political positions.\n\n \n Being anti-gun isn't political, Foundit. It's essentially saying 'you shouldn't be able to adequately defend yourself.' But if you'd rather, then take anyone who's ever been adamantly anti-gun, refuses to touch them, or whatever--NO political stance present, no lobbying, so don't hide behind that here--would you seriously expect gun-advocates to NOT say 'I'd never vote for someone like that' when being able to carry a gun to defend themselves and their family is an important thing to them? Surely you don't.\n \n \nI have ALREADY SAID that if an atheist STATES that they are politically anti-religious (or demonstrates that fact), it is perfectly understandable to not vote for them.\n\n \n Foundit, you're inserting this \"political\" thing here when it's convenient, but the reality is that ALL issues are political if someone perceives a candidate isn't open to what they feel is important, and the reality is that shouldn't HAVE to matter. There shouldn't have to be this litmus test on candidate support or lack of support that says \"is there evidence this will ONLY apply politically.\" If a candidate has a NONPOLITICAL view at odds with almost everyone in the country--75% was your stat--on an issue that's extremely important to many of those , can't expect some people to NOT say I won't vote for such a candidate. \n \n \nYou keep saying things like that ignoring the mirror in your face.\n Atheists are no more \"by nature\" intolerant than Christians are.\n\n \n But we aren't talking about Christians here, are we? The thing you brought up was about voting for ATHEISTS. Though I can't say I blame you for wanting to change the subject. You're trying to turn this isn't a \"but-Christians-do-it-more\" thing, but it's a red herring.\n \n \nOkay. You're NOT agnostic, right?\n Are you \"open to atheism\"?\n\n \n Actually, I think agnosticism has more in common--in terms of tolerance of religion--with theism than it does atheism.\n \n \nDo you understand a \"live-or-let-live\" ideal for atheists?\n\n \n Sorry, haven't ever seen an atheist with such an ideal. I'm certainly willing to see one though; could you point me to one or link to such an atheist's writings that doesn't associate religion with ignorance and wouldn't prefer society not be religious if he had a choice?\n \n \nSecondly, let's take the issue of \"morality\".\n You believe atheists are IMMORAL for denying the existence of your God. You believe in a \"loving\" and \"just\" God that will ETERNALLY TORTURE atheists just for being atheists.\n\n \n Well, you're getting into some rather involved issues of theology here, and the two sentences you dedicate to it doesn't really do the matter justice at all. \n \n If someone sticks his hand out and gives everyone in danger of that eternal torture a way out that has been explained clearly, then it's rather hard to press the case that that same someone is 'eternally torturing' them. Besides, if they don't believe in that God, then what is there to worry about? If they're confident in their view that he's not real, then it shouldn't be an issue from their standpoint anyway. If a homeowner stays in the house because he doesn't believe there's really going to be a fire, when he's been told there is great danger of fire, why is that the fault of those who tell him that? He can stick to him lack of belief if he wants. That's up to him, and if he's sure of it, then he should have nothing to worry about if his views are so clearly correct. \n \n But this is all beside the point. It's a diversion--you're trying to turn this around and make it about Christians when that's not what the issue was about.\n \n \nAnd I think that when I give a dictionary definition which demonstrates my claim to be true, and you refuse to really broach the issue, it's not really a response.\n People can say white is the absence of \"color\". That doesn't mean that white IS NOT a \"color\"...\n\n \n I just find it interesting because the view of yours is quite at odds with most atheists I've seen on the matter, who tend to rather simply chalk atheism down to nothing more than lack of belief.",

   "Well, there you go again, assuming that other people here would react the way Christianists would, and use the law to promote their agendas when in office. The difference between militant Christianists and us meek little old atheists is that we recognise there are limits on what the government can or should do about religion. We would merely not give in to demands that religious law become secular law, and you lot would scream and wail that by preventing you from forcing your religious opinions on everyone else, we were curbing your \"rights\".\n \n Let me teach you the obvious: you do NOT have a right to force your religion on anyone else. Neither do we atheists, only we wouldn't even try. The itchy fingers of Christianists, however, shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a legal trigger.\n\n \n emoticon_rolleyes Nah, your freedom to be an atheist is certainly not in danger, and you're even going to continue to be free to say all the mean things you want about religious people. Don't worry, your freedom of belligerence and prejudice is safe.\n \n \nAtheism is as open to religion as capitalism is to socialism, or arithmetic to poetry. \n\n \n Except, arithmetic--by it's very definition of an issue--isn't a rejection of poetry, now is it? Atheism IS built as a rejection of theism, even if only a personal one. It carries a certain intolerance by default. \n \n \nIt does amuse me, though, that when the more than usually incoherent fundies try to attack atheism, the worst they can say of it, after making the not very insightful comment that it is godless, is that it is a religion!\n\n \n Take it up with Foundit if it's an issue for you; he's the one making that argument here. \n \n \nIf guns were kept on firing ranges, and religion in churches and homes, there wouldn't be an issue with either, would there? Someone needs to keep a lid on that cauldron\n\n \n Well, well ... if there was ever an example of why some would refuse to vote for someone of your view, there it is! emoticon_xgood Religion doesn't have to be only conducted in homes and churches, nor guns only possessed on firing ranges.

   "Foundit, can you find me ONE single atheist who is open to religious belief in his or her life? Just one?\n\n Why do you insist on sidelining this issue with pointless approaches?\n EVEN IF we were to assume that every single atheist was not open to religious belief in his or her life, that does not mean that the atheists are not open to religious belief IN OTHER PEOPLE's LIVES.\n \n Again, it's like saying \"Since candidate X is not open to being gay (or straight), then I cannot vote for candidate X cause that person is inadequate to represent me.\"\n \n \n \nAnd then one that wouldn't rather see society be non-religious?\n\n Again, POINTLESS.\n Wouldn't every Christian \"rather see society as entirely Christian\"?\n Your bible commands you to GO OUT AND CONVERT non-believers, so don't even try to deny it.\n \n \n \nSaying one doesn't believe in religion IS being 'not open' to it.\n\n You don't understand boundaries.\n I am gay.\n That doesn't mean I require (or want) everybody else to be ...\n All this \"not open\" diatribe is a meaningless distraction. It's a pointless requirement!\n \n \n \nYou might as well be saying that we shouldn't say someone who doesn't believe in the big bang isn't open to it. They aren't, but we shouldn't say it that way? Is that what you're saying?\n\n I could care less if you \"say\" it.\n When you treat it as a reason for blind discrimination and exclusion of a qualified candidate, THAT is the item in question...\n \n \n \nYou're making a distinction that isn't even really real. One IS the other.\n\n No. You're wrong.\n I just pointed out that BY THE BIBLE, Christians WANT a fully converted Christian society.\n Does that mean you don't believe in the freedom of religion of atheists? NO.\n \n By YOUR argument, that would mean Christians would be more likely to NOT represent atheists, and probably INHERENTLY and UNIVERSALLY willing to discriminate against them.\n \n \n \nWell then what's the problem here? Why are you so concerned about this?\n\n Do I really need to remind you of what prompted this part of the conversation just a few posts back?\n I pointed out that atheists would have MORE REASON to be interested in first amendment protections than Christians.\n Remember???\n \n \n \nGee, a group of people believe a particular issue is important, even though there are issues of greater instance out there of something else or other things than their issue. You might as well be asking coal minders in WVA to not take an \"I'll-never-vote-for-an-anticoal-candidate\" approach just because there are other issues out there. That's the issue important to THEM, Foundit. People are naturally going to make their decisions on voting based on what's important to THEM, more than other things.\n\n So???\n I'm not saying that we should make laws on rationals for voting.\n My point is that I label a conclusion of THIS POLL as showing prejudice towards atheists.\n \n Prejudice against blacks swung a significant amount of voters away from Obama. Polls show that 10% of the country REFUSED to vote for Obama just cause of his race.\n Now, that was \"their decisions on voting based on what's important to THEM\".\n It was also prejudice.\n \n And if you would STOP AND THINK, I have REPEATEDLY made it a point to say that if you had an atheist candidate WHO STATED they were politically against religion, or they had a history of being antagonistic towards religion (like limiting religious freedom), I UNDERSTAND and AGREE with an approach of denying that person their vote.\n Each time I say that, and you try to come back with blind analogies of \"anticoal candidate\" or something similar, it is frustrating because you are either NOT listening, or NOT honestly realizing what is going on.\n \n Where we HAVE a dispute is that I am saying that \"being atheist\" does NOT automatically make a person more adverse to the first amendment religious protections.\n It does NOT hinder one from protecting religion under the constitution.\n \n \n \nYou seem to think we should all be some completely altruistic voters and put other issues ahead of what issues WE feel is important.\n\n BLOWI.\n I have explained this enough times where your comment is just plain BLOWI.\n The \"issue\" you are talking about here involves YOU STEREO-TYPING atheists as having a non-specific political stance more adverse or less sympathetic to religion.\n \n \n \nSo ... you're saying most atheists have no problem with religion? They're open to it?\n\n I am rapidly coming to the realization that you cannot comprehend a separation of a person's personal beliefs, and a person's desire for laws to restrict society.\n If you would STOP and THINK about half of what you say and the reciprocal of it, it SHOULD stop you in your tracks.\n Are YOU \"open\" to atheism?\n Do you have \"no problem\" with atheism?\n I guess since you sympathize with people who would refuse a vote to their party's qualified candidate, JUST cause he's atheist, the answer to the last question is obviously \"yes\".\n \n \n \nEven though they find it irrational or demonstrating a lack of reason, and that they wouldn't rather have reason carry the day in society? I really think you don't have a realistic picture of the situation.\n\n Again, there is a difference inbetween DESIRE and ACTION.\n If a pretty secretary walks by, a guy could want to be with her, even if he's married.\n That doesn't mean he DOES it.\n \n Likewise, just because an atheist (LIKE A CHRISTIAN) would prefer more religious dominance, it does not mean they ACT on it inappropriately and ABUSE power they have to make it happen.\n \n \n \nThe REASON atheists aren't religious, Foundit, is that they believe it is delusional or demonstrates ignorance and lack of reason.\n\n You know, YOU YOURSELF have laid the ground-work which agrees with some aspects of the foundation of WHY I say atheism is a religion.\n I have given the definition for religion, which atheists qualify for.\n \n Atheists profess to KNOW something that is clearly NOT KNOWN. Much like some Christians (not talking about you).\n Deity based religion sometimes attempts to use \"intelligent design\" to further their own approach. But there is no SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE to substantiate that theory.\n Likewise, atheists sometimes use \"evolution\" to further their own approach. But again, there is no SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE to substantiate \"evolution means no god\".\n \n \n \nShow me ONE atheist who doesn't think that religion demonstrates lack of reason.\n\n Pointless request. It means nothing to my point. \n Do you think atheism lacks religious morality?\n And since the bible says you should, does that MEAN anything?\n \n \n \nBill Mayer seems to be a typical atheist in his VIEWS. He just happens to be an outspoken one who has the ability to reach a lot of people. None of this is stereoptyping. It's observation, frankly. Take Lesz for example--he's gone to great lengths to argue faith means a lack of reason.\n\n Again, POINTLESS.\n There is a difference inbetween \"religion uses faith instead of reason\" and \"Since I'm an atheist, when I get into political office I am going to...\"\n \n You are side-tracking this conversation rather thoroughly.\n \n \n \nBeing anti-gun isn't political, Foundit. It's essentially saying 'you shouldn't be able to adequately defend yourself.'\n\n Your two sentences contradict yourself. (not to mention misrepresent the anti-gun position)\n When a person proceeds to go beyond what THEY want in THEIR life, and they try to ENFORCE their position onto OTHER PEOPLE to restrict THEIR lives, THAT is when it becomes \"political\".\n \n \n \nBut if you'd rather, then take anyone who's ever been adamantly anti-gun, refuses to touch them, or whatever--NO political stance present, no lobbying, so don't hide behind that here--would you seriously expect gun-advocates to NOT say 'I'd never vote for someone like that' when being able to carry a gun to defend themselves and their family is an important thing to them? Surely you don't.\n\n Again, the poll basically came down to a reality where your party has ALREADY NOMINATED the QUALIFIED candidate in question.\n So, you can either go with how he AGREES with you (cause he's in your party) on multiple issues and HELP him get elected.\n Or you can throw ALL THAT AWAY to fixate on one thing.\n \n Sarah Palin's daughter had a kid, right? Out of wedlock.\n Would you think it rational for Republicans ALL OVER THE PLACE to REFUSE to vote for her because they hold \"no sex until marriage\" as important?\n Would that be rational to you?\n \n \n \nFoundit, you're inserting this \"political\" thing here when it's convenient...\n\n You just stopped me in my tracks with this nonsense.\n THE ARTICLE STARTING THIS POLL WAS ABOUT \"POLITICAL\".\n YOU are trying to drag this OFF TOPIC to IGNORE the \"political\" aspect of things.\n \n I have been trying to respond to your non-topical approach, but I am seeing now that you have NO REAL INTEREST in actually discussing this.\n You want to try to twist my position into something I have CLEARLY stated it is not.\n \n I have already stated that if you DO HAVE an atheist candidate who is politically ANTAGONISTIC (not assumed) to religion, I agree with not voting for that person.\n But at different times, you have already tried to drag to the strawman by giving analogies which involve \"anti-coal\" candidates, or something similar.\n It's getting to the point where I'm thinking of just summarizing my view, and responding that you're ignoring or misrepresenting my point when that's all your reply is...\n \n \n \n... but the reality is that ALL issues are political if someone perceives a candidate isn't open to what they feel is important, and the reality is that shouldn't HAVE to matter.\n\n I'm gay.\n Obama is not. He's married to Michelle, and I'm pretty positive he isn't \"open\" to being gay.\n Should the fact that he is not open to being straight bother me?\n \n The fact that he is straight and not gay IS NOT a political issue.\n YOU are trying to turn \"this candidate is atheist and not religious\" INTO a political issue, and it's just plain nonsense.\n \n \n \nThere shouldn't have to be this litmus test on candidate support or lack of support that says \"is there evidence this will ONLY apply politically.\"\n\n I talk of NO litmus test.\n Only accurately labeling PREJUDICE where it exists.\n THAT is ultimately what you have a problem with. You don't like recognizing PREJUDICE in inconvenient places.\n \n \n \nIf a candidate has a NONPOLITICAL view at odds with almost everyone in the country--75% was your stat--on an issue that's extremely important to many of those , can't expect some people to NOT say I won't vote for such a candidate.\n\n What I \"expect\" is irrelevant.\n Noting the fact that the ORIGINAL ARTICLE (not what you try to drag this conversation away from) demonstrates anti-atheism prejudice IS the point.\n \n \n \nBut we aren't talking about Christians here, are we? The thing you brought up was about voting for ATHEISTS.\n\n Silly me.\n Why should I expect you to have an objective standard you apply TO YOURSELF, instead of just a spotlight on others.\n Like I have pointed out before, Christianity has a tendency of fixating on things they are \"not\" guilty of, like atheism, and refusing to take an objective look at the rationality and even-handedness (or lack thereof) of their approach.\n \n My point was regarding THE STANDARD you were applying, but I can't force you to pay attention to what you are saying.\n \n \n \nYou're trying to turn this isn't a \"but-Christians-do-it-more\" thing, but it's a red herring.\n\n No. It's exposing the falseness of your standard.\n It's asking you to look at the beam in your own eye.\n \n \n \nActually, I think agnosticism has more in common--in terms of tolerance of religion--with theism than it does atheism.\n\n Can you define \"tolerance of religion\" to quantify that statement?\n Wait! Let me guess.\n Not going to answer that, are you...\n \n \n \nSorry, haven't ever seen an atheist with such an ideal.\n\n Considering how you repeatedly miscategorize people's positions, you HAVE but you just don't realize it.\n Lesz has also corrected you on your statements of his position, but again you don't recognize it.\n \n \n \nI'm certainly willing to see one though; could you point me to one or link to such an atheist's writings that doesn't associate religion with ignorance and wouldn't prefer society not be religious if he had a choice?\n\n Again, considering CHRISTIANS ALSO want society to be Christian, by their religion, it demonstrates the falseness of your position.\n By your logic, Christians CANNOT be \"live and let live\" either...\n \n \n \nWell, you're getting into some rather involved issues of theology here, and the two sentences you dedicate to it doesn't really do the matter justice at all. \n\n It's an accurate summation, and you know you will have to spend a lot of words to obfuscate or change the subject...\n \n \n \nIf someone sticks his hand out and gives everyone in danger of that eternal torture a way out that has been explained clearly, then it's rather hard to press the case that that same someone is 'eternally torturing' them.\n\n \"explained clearly\"???\n Oh COME ON now.\n How many religions are out there?\n What makes \"Christianity\" any more \"clear\" than Judaism or Islam or Buddhism?\n \n \n \nBesides, if they don't believe in that God, then what is there to worry about? If they're confident in their view that he's not real, then it shouldn't be an issue from their standpoint anyway.\n\n It's as much of an issue as the ATHEIST'S OPINION OF CHRISTIANS is an issue.\n Remember? YOU made what another person's religious perspective on your religion as important.\n \n \n \nBut this is all beside the point. It's a diversion--you're trying to turn this around and make it about Christians when that's not what the issue was about.\n\n Again, this is an attempt to get you to realize what your own standards say about you, and of course such self-reflection ain't gonna happen with you...\n \n \n \nI just find it interesting because the view of yours is quite at odds with most atheists I've seen on the matter, who tend to rather simply chalk atheism down to nothing more than lack of belief.\n\n A \"lack of belief\" would be more accurately assessed as agnosticism.\n Atheists DO have a belief.

No matter what you convince someone of or not, it won't change the fact they are gay or straight. But if you convince someone that there is no God, they WILL change to an atheist, so to speak. People DO want to convince people of their views. The \"boundaries\" you speak of are different kinds of boundaries between these two issues. A better comparison would be two completely IDEOLOGICAL issues--say, a view about gays (that it's a normal thing) as compared to atheism, in which case BOTH are examples of people who would rather society think they way they do.\n \n \nWhen you treat it as a reason for blind discrimination and exclusion of a qualified candidate, THAT is the item in question...\n\n \n That's just it ... it's NOT necessarily \"blind\" at all. That's what you don't get, because you're determined to see this as prejudice instead of considering all the other possibilities. You're bringing that to the table as a presumption; otherwise you'd consider the other reasons I've given for why they don't vote for them. \n \n \nI pointed out that atheists would have MORE REASON to be interested in first amendment protections than Christians.\n Remember???\n\n \n But there's no basis for that. There's no reason to think they would, in terms of the Free Exercise clause. The only reason you put forth that they might care more is because of what's laid out in the Establishment clause (protecting atheists from those all those dastardly evil Christians who apparently all want to pull the chairs out from under little old ladies and steal candy from babies). I see no reason that religious people wouldn't more readily champion the 1st amendment because of their championing of the Free Exercise clause than atheist would because of their championing of the Establishment clause. Athiests don't seem interested in the Free Exercise clause, after all.\n \n \nI am rapidly coming to the realization that you cannot comprehend a separation of a person's personal beliefs, and a person's desire for laws to restrict society.\n\n \n \nAnd if you would STOP AND THINK, I have REPEATEDLY made it a point to say that if you had an atheist candidate WHO STATED they were politically against religion, or they had a history of being antagonistic towards religion (like limiting religious freedom), I UNDERSTAND and AGREE with an approach of denying that person their vote.\n\n \n Calm down please, and don't start up with hostilities.\n \n By your logic, we should just as easily vote for a NON-political neo-nazi as we would a tolerant person. Your use of \"political\" here doesn't change the fact that the inherent intolerance of atheism by being a view rooted in rejection of another view is still offensive to many religious people. Who could blame them? I certainly don't. There is no reasonable standard out there which says we should only vote for a candidate based on what we think they would do POLITICALLY. A neo-nazi is still a neo-nazi, even if he's not inclined to do anything politically at all. (And I don't mean that analogy in the sense that atheists are like neo-nazis. I only use it to point out that it's unreasonable to demand anyone use what someone would do in being \"POLITICAL\" as the standard of determining who we will or will not vote for.\n \n \nWhere we HAVE a dispute is that I am saying that \"being atheist\" does NOT automatically make a person more adverse to the first amendment religious protections.\n It does NOT hinder one from protecting religion under the constitution.\n\n \n No. You're saying (or have essentially said) that being an atheist would make someone MORE likely to champion the 1st amendment. No one's arguing there aren't atheists who don't value the 1st amendment. Naturally they do, because of the Establishment clause, which protects them. But that doesn't mean they'd more likely do so than religious people who champion the Free Exercise clause, which protects THEM. And just because one group MAY be more in danger than the other doesn't mean one (religious people) is any less likely to champion religious freedom. \n \n \nI have explained this enough times where your comment is just plain BLOWI.\n The \"issue\" you are talking about here involves YOU STEREO-TYPING atheists as having a non-specific political stance more adverse or less sympathetic to religion.\n\n \n What stereotypes, specifically, do you think I'm using here, Foundit? I've shown quite clearly that it's unreasonable to think atheists wouldn't rather see society as atheists. Of COURSE they do, and who could blame them? It's their view, after all. That's ALL I'm saying, and if that's a stereotype, it's an accurate one. Yet it's enough to prevent quite a few religious people from voting for an atheist. Nothing wrong with that; people do that all the time for when a given candidate rejects a particular view they consider very important.\n \n \nAtheists profess to KNOW something that is clearly NOT KNOWN. Much like some Christians (not talking about you).\n Deity based religion sometimes attempts to use \"intelligent design\" to further their own approach. But there is no SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE to substantiate that theory.\n Likewise, atheists sometimes use \"evolution\" to further their own approach. But again, there is no SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE to substantiate \"evolution means no god\".\n\n \n Yes, I have no problem personally with what you're saying. I just find it interesting that what you're arguing here is something that many, many atheists have taken enormous issue with at times. And it's interesting that resident atheists here aren't disagreeing with your assertion that atheism is a religion, when they would if it were a religious person making the assertion.\n \n \nCan you define \"tolerance of religion\" to quantify that statement?\n Wait! Let me guess.\n Not going to answer that, are you...\n\n \n Sure, I'll answer it. Atheism is a REJECTION of theism, Foundit. Agnosticism isn't so; it's saying we can't really know anyway. Therefore it's not so much a closed-cased as it is for the atheist. \n \n \nLesz has also corrected you on your statements of his position, but again you don't recognize it.\n\n \n Lesz has demonstrated time and time again that he isn't tolerant toward religion, OR religious freedom, by the things he says about it, no matter what he states as his \"position\". (e.g., his recent assertion that religion needs to be kept in churches and homes, when in fact freedom of religion allows it to not be limited to such places.)",

The fact that you're not going to be able to honestly do it should tell you something here.\n\n \n Most of us atheists probably do wish religious believers would see the light and abandon their perverse beliefs. But we are not so naive as to expect it.

The \"boundaries\" you speak of are different kinds of boundaries between these two issues. A better comparison would be two completely IDEOLOGICAL issues--say, a view about gays (that it's a normal thing) as compared to atheism, in which case BOTH are examples of people who would rather society think they way they do.\n\n \n Now you argue it is illegitimate to persuade a religious person of one's atheistic views! Persuasion is not the same as force, dear chap.\n \n \n \nBut there's no basis for that. There's no reason to think they would, in terms of the Free Exercise clause. The only reason you put forth that they might care more is because of what's laid out in the Establishment clause (protecting atheists from those all those dastardly evil Christians who apparently all want to pull the chairs out from under little old ladies and steal candy from babies). I see no reason that religious people wouldn't more readily champion the 1st amendment because of their championing of the Free Exercise clause than atheist would because of their championing of the Establishment clause. Athiests don't seem interested in the Free Exercise clause, after all.\n\n \n Pure bollocks, and you know it. Theocrats have no interest in the 1st Amendment, for pretty obvious reasons. Atheists, on the other hand, are very interested in it, because it protects us from you lot.\n \n \nAtheism is a REJECTION of theism, Foundit. Agnosticism isn't so; it's saying we can't really know anyway. Therefore it's not so much a closed-cased as it is for the atheist. \n\n \n Agnostics don't know anything, that's the problem with them. Of course atheism is a rejection of theistic belief. Whoever claimed otherwise? Your accusation is much more virulent, and that is that atheists deny theists have any rights. A scurrilous slander, but fairly typical. That is an accusation more justly leveled at theists with regard to their attitudes towards atheists.\n \n \nLesz has demonstrated time and time again that he isn't tolerant toward religion, OR religious freedom, by the things he says about it, no matter what he states as his \"position\". (e.g., his recent assertion that religion needs to be kept in churches and homes, when in fact freedom of religion allows it to not be limited to such places.)\n\n \n Rather than have the courage to post to me directly, you bury this petty little attack in a post to someone else. Well, I am not surprised by your behaviour. Sorry, sweetums, but your character assassination, while not unexpected from a Christian, is misplaced. I do uphold your right to believe whatever asinine faith you feel moved to cherish. Don't expect plaudits for it, though.\n \n Apparently, you believe that religion has a legitimate place in government, despite the Constitution that gives us the freedom of and from religion. From is just as important as of. Pity you don't seem to recognise that. I don't care if you parade your religion in the streets. I don't even care if you display your religious symbols in public parks and spaces, so long as you do not prevent others from doing the same thing.\n \n I do care when you attempt to enact your theocratic legislation. You claim that opposition to your theocracy is intolerance of your religion. I suggest it is a blow for freedom, a concept you seem to be struggling to understand.",

The fact that you're not going to be able to honestly do it should tell you something here.\n\n What proof would suffice you?\n Lesz is a perfect example.\n Does Lesz say anything about making you change religion, or discriminating against you because of religion?\n \n As Lesz just said: \"Most of us atheists probably do wish religious believers would see the light and abandon their perverse beliefs.

If wishes were fishes...\n However, unlike theocrats, most of us atheists aren't going to try to force anyone to accept the irrationality of their religious belief system.

You seem to take what is essentially \"disagreement\" as something far more intrusive than it is.\n \n I have tried to get you to apply your own standards to your own religion, but you are proving resistant. Refusing to realize and admit that you yourself (and your fellow Christians) are EXACTLY guilty of what you claim disqualifies atheists as candidates.\n \n I said it before and I'll say it again.\n I think what this REALLY boils down to is that you are afraid that atheists will do in office what you EXPECT Christians to do in office.\n \n \n \nWouldn't every Christian \"rather see society as entirely Christian\"?\n\n \nAbsolutely. You're the one arguing that one group's views are only personal, not me.\n\n So what's the impact of your complaint then, if YOU (and your fellow Christians) ARE JUST AS GUILTY as atheists supposedly are....\n \n \n \nIt goes to show that your claim that it's (atheism) just a PERSONAL thing is bunk. You trying to turn this around and make it an issue about \"Christians\" doesn't change that fact.\n\n By \"personal thing\", I am talking that in their PERSONAL lives, atheists do not believe in God.\n But they tolerate and accept non-atheists who don't believe likewise.\n \n You try to refute my point by just saying \"bunk\", and htat's it.\n And the point regarding \"Christianity\" is to expose the HYPOCRISY of your proposed situation.\n \n \n \nBeing gay isn't purely an ideological issue; it's not an issue that changes based on thinking, as theism/atheism is.\n\n We've already been over this using the EXACT SAME APPROACH that you used.\n You asked how could an atheist represent a Christian as well, when the atheist is not Christian and is not open to being Christian.\n Likewise, how can a straight/gay person represent a gay/straight person, when the straight/gay person is not open to being gay/straight?\n \n The physical attribute LEADS to ideological gaps which YOU CLAIM are significant.\n But you repeatedly ignore the ideological aspect of this by ignoring it.\n \n \n \nNo matter what you convince someone of or not, it won't change the fact they are gay or straight. But if you convince someone that there is no God, they WILL change to an atheist, so to speak.\n\n Come ON Jyoshu.\n That is EXACTLY what Christian organizations try to do with their \"reparative therapy\" groups.\n So, TO USE YOUR OWN STANDARDS, the reparative therapy groups are yet another example of Christian intolerance.\n \n But as for \"convincing someone there is no God\", so what?\n Is your faith so weak that you fear simple conversation and religious challenge?\n \n The REAL problem here is YOU ARE EXPOSING YOUR fears in this whole process.\n Do you think atheists have such a concern with atheists being converted to Christianity?\n \n \n \nPeople DO want to convince people of their views. The \"boundaries\" you speak of are different kinds of boundaries between these two issues. A better comparison would be two completely IDEOLOGICAL issues--say, a view about gays (that it's a normal thing) as compared to atheism, in which case BOTH are examples of people who would rather society think they way they do.\n\n I've already explained, repeatedly, I don't care if people think homosexuality is not \"normal\".\n It's their desire for discrimination (yes or no) that is the defining factor.\n \n By YOUR standards, I should decide that anybody who thinks homosexuality \"is not normal\" should not receive my vote. Ever.\n Anybody who thinks homosexuality is \"immoral\" should not receive my vote. \n \n I think part of the problem is that this country caters SOOOO MUCH to Christianity that Christians don't understand REAL choices, and they over-react to minor differences.\n \n If an atheist politician were to convince somebody to be an atheist, SO WHAT?\n What are you afraid of?\n \n \n \nThat's just it ... it's NOT necessarily \"blind\" at all. That's what you don't get, because you're determined to see this as prejudice instead of considering all the other possibilities. You're bringing that to the table as a presumption; otherwise you'd consider the other reasons I've given for why they don't vote for them.\n\n I don't understand how you can continue to complain like this, when you habitually CUT AND PASTE AROUND my THOROUGH EXPLANATION WHY it is prejudice.\n 1) It is STEREO-TYPING by your explanation. YOU assume that the atheist is either antagonistic or not as capable of representing Christians. (Like political representation is somehow better defined by personal religion in the first place...)\n 2) The PHRASING OF THE QUESTION.\n The question stated that the candidate was:\n a) well-qualified.\n b) already nominated by your party,\n c) and the ONLY other piece of information is that he's an atheist/black/etc, etc.\n \n If I said: \"Well, John Doe is well-qualified and he is already nominated by our party for position X. Could you vote for him?\"\n Reasonable response? \"Probably\" or \"Yes\".\n But when that answer gets turned around to \"No\" based SOLELY on religion, that is glaring.\n \n Furthermore, I AM CONSIDERING THE REASONS YOU STATED in my analysis, so stop claiming I am not.\n I see your excuses as FURTHER EVIDENCE of the prejudice. Stereo-typing based on ignorance IS a part of prejudice.\n \n \n \nBut there's no basis for that. There's no reason to think they would, in terms of the Free Exercise clause. The only reason you put forth that they might care more is because of what's laid out in the Establishment clause (protecting atheists from those all those dastardly evil Christians who apparently all want to pull the chairs out from under little old ladies and steal candy from babies). I see no reason that religious people wouldn't more readily champion the 1st amendment because of their championing of the Free Exercise clause than atheist would because of their championing of the Establishment clause. Athiests don't seem interested in the Free Exercise clause, after all.\n\n You're repeating yourself and ignoring what I have already told you!\n It is NOT the establishment clause which helps justify \"employment protection\" based on religion.\n It IS the \"freedom of religion\" clause which helps justify \"employment protection\" based on religion.\n \n \n \nCalm down please, and don't start up with hostilities.\n\n Those aren't hostilities Jyoshu, so quit with the melodrama.\n You are obviously not thinking about what I am saying. You are reacting and throwing out snap responses, without even CONSIDERING my words.\n You are looking for quick ways to disregard my statements, without even realizing them.\n The fact that you are REPEATING your arguments I have already addressed (when you haven't addressed my response) is further evidence of that.\n \n Just out of curiousity, how would you tihnk I should phrase a \"polite\" request for you to think about what I am saying?\n \n \n \nBy your logic, we should just as easily vote for a NON-political neo-nazi as we would a tolerant person.\n\n Again, you ignore my words.\n You QUOTE MY WORDS, but you ignore them. To repeat what I said:\n \"... I have REPEATEDLY made it a point to say that if you had an atheist candidate WHO STATED they were politically against religion, or they had a history of being antagonistic towards religion (like limiting religious freedom), I UNDERSTAND and AGREE with an approach of denying that person their vote.\"\n A \"non-political neo-nazi\" WOULD STILL BE \"antagonistic\".\n \n \n \nYour use of \"political\" here doesn't change the fact that the inherent intolerance of atheism by being a view rooted in rejection of another view is still offensive to many religious people.\n\n Okay. That one is book-marked.\n You have just attempted to justify a pretense that SIMPLE DISAGREEMENT on an issue (like this specific one of religion) is somehow \"offensive\".\n \n A lot of Christians believe that God has said homosexuality is a sin. These are typically not open to changing their mind.\n Should I find that \"offensive\"?\n \n \n \nWho could blame them? I certainly don't.\n\n Of course you don't.\n You are trying to justify their discrimination and prejudice!\n \n \n \nWhat stereotypes, specifically, do you think I'm using here, Foundit?\n\n And another example of you not listening.\n I have already explained this, EXPLICITLY.\n \n If I had an adult conversation, face to face, with somebody who was obviously not listening to what I was saying, I would say something to get their attention and tell them that they should listen.\n Otherwise, don't waste my time replying to my posts. It's just another form of Archie's method of \"quoting\" the entire post, but then saying ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to the points of what was previously said.\n \n \n \nI've shown quite clearly that it's unreasonable to think atheists wouldn't rather see society as atheists. Of COURSE they do, and who could blame them? It's their view, after all.\n\n SO WHAT?\n Christians have the same desire!\n Does that make them INHERENTLY somehow sinister or less capable of protecting atheists?\n You're trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.\n \n \n \nYet it's enough to prevent quite a few religious people from voting for an atheist.\n\n Funny how you were just talking to me about \"assumptions\", and here you are repeating your own...\n (Regarding your assumption that your song and dance is the reason that \"quite a few religious people\" don't vote for atheists...)\n \n \n \nYes, I have no problem personally with what you're saying. I just find it interesting that what you're arguing here is something that many, many atheists have taken enormous issue with at times. And it's interesting that resident atheists here aren't disagreeing with your assertion that atheism is a religion, when they would if it were a religious person making the assertion.\n\n I find your repeated attempts to instigate conflict between others as fascinating.\n I find it fascinating that you assert you are for gay rights, but you refuse to engage in conflict with other Christians who are against gay rights.\n \n On the \"atheism\" thing, both trebor and lesz have stated disagreement.\n But it's like arguing about the inconsequential molehill compared to the discriminatory mountain.\n If I were to change my statement to say \"atheism is not a religion\", it wouldn't affect my arguments.\n If lesz were to change his statement to say \"atheism is a religion\", it wouldn't affect his arguments.\n \n \n \nCan you define \"tolerance of religion\" to quantify that statement?\n Wait! Let me guess.\n Not going to answer that, are you...\n\n \nSure, I'll answer it. Atheism is a REJECTION of theism, Foundit. Agnosticism isn't so; it's saying we can't really know anyway. Therefore it's not so much a closed-cased as it is for the atheist.\n\n I'm a stickler on things to the extent that I insist on trying to remove confusion where there might be some...\n On this, I asked you to define \"tolerance of religion\".\n Your reply leads me to a conclusion that you define \"tolerance of religion\" as a lack of a \"rejection\" of religion.\n If that's inaccurate, you can obviously correct me.\n \n Again, we're in a situation where we have to apply the standard to OTHER THINGS other than atheism to realize the extreme nature of what you're saying.\n Suppose we talk about \"tolerance of Christianity\". By the standard you have proposed, JEWS are not \"tolerant of Christianity\" because they reject the idea that Christ is god. Ergo, Jews should not vote for Christians.\n A reciprocal argument exists for Christian \"tolerance of Jews\".\n We could go through comparing religion to religion, and over and over again we would conclude there is no \"tolerance\" for that religion from other religions.\n \n What you are doing is essentially talking about SIMPLE DISAGREEMENT, where one of the persons involved is not \"open\" to having his mind changed.\n You have just defined SIMPLE DISAGREEMENT as being INTOLERANCE!\n \n THAT is one of the things I don't think you get about your arguments. You apply them so \"liberally\" that they cover a multitude of NON-sins (to use a metaphor, not talking about literal sins).\n \n \n \nLesz has demonstrated time and time again that he isn't tolerant toward religion, OR religious freedom, by the things he says about it, no matter what he states as his \"position\". (e.g., his recent assertion that religion needs to be kept in churches and homes, when in fact freedom of religion allows it to not be limited to such places.)\n\n Lesz has responded to this.\n And I think the best response to your claim is in Lesz's initial statement.\n \n You apparently TAKE OFFENSE to other people's desires to how they would like to have agreement and common beliefs in this world with others.\n Lesz? Does not.\n Again, you need to take a hard look at yourself in the mirror with respect to the standards you espouse. They are unreasonable.",

   "What proof would suffice you?\n Lesz is a perfect example.\n Does Lesz say anything about making you change religion, or discriminating against you because of religion?\n\n \n No, but I said nothing about \"making\" or \"discriminating.\" However, if you think he wouldn't want less religion in the world, you're deluding yourseldf. I really think you would do well to step back and think about what your position on this is, in the bigger picture. I'm pointing out that people want to convince society to go with their views. I ask you to show me an atheist who wouldn't rather society be atheist. You choose an atheist--perhaps the most virulent on the forum--who has never given any indication he's not like any OTHER person who holds to an ideoology and goes farther than most people by berating the thinking he disagrees with; you seriously think he wouldn't want more people to become atheists?\n \n \nAs Lesz just said: \"Most of us atheists probably do wish religious believers would see the light and abandon their perverse beliefs.\n\n \n Well there you go. you just refuted your own example with his own words.\n \n After all, NO ONE is talking about \"forcing\" anyone to do anything, here.\n \n \nI think one big problem here is that there is a big gap inbetween what your words mean and imply, and what our words mean and imply. You seem to take what is essentially \"disagreement\" as something far more intrusive than it is.\n\n \n The problem is that for the typical atheist, it doesn't seem to BE mere disagreement. There's no way to hold to the atheist position without a certain view that the opposite view is not associated with ignorance and delusion. Lesz has done this DIRECTLY, here.\n \n Show me ONE atheist who gives real credence to religion. You can't do it. He doesn't just \"disagree\". It's not like someone just having a different opinion, but rather believing the other opinion is an example of ignorance and not a VALID way of thinking. And so naturally, this is offensive to many religious people. Frankly, I think you have a naive view of the situation. If someone says \"I disagree\", that's one thing. If someone says \"I disagree, and your position is ignorant but mine is rational\", it's something else. There's not just disagreement, but a VALUE JUDGMENT being made there. At that point, it becomes offensive. If you think all this is just stereotyping, then by all means, show an atheist who gives credence to religion, and views it as a VALID opinion.\n \n \nI said it before and I'll say it again.\n I think what this REALLY boils down to is that you are afraid that atheists will do in office what you EXPECT Christians to do in office.\n\n \n And I don't care what you think Christians would do. I'm trying to get you to see why the atheist position tends to be offensive as it is. As it is, you're only trying to talk about your paranoia over Christians rather than discussing the point of atheists.\n \n \nBy \"personal thing\", I am talking that in their PERSONAL lives, atheists do not believe in God.\n But they tolerate and accept non-atheists who don't believe likewise.\n\n \n EVERYONE 'tolerates' other people in this society, Foundit, because they have to. That doesn't speak to the offensiveness of their positions. it doesn't speak to anything here.\n \n \nLikewise, how can a straight/gay person represent a gay/straight person, when the straight/gay person is not open to being gay/straight?\n\n \n They CAN'T, insofar as they aren't going to be able to identify with and really understand the issues of the other. That's the point.\n \n \nCome ON Jyoshu.\n That is EXACTLY what Christian organizations try to do with their \"reparative therapy\" groups.\n\n \n Complete red herring. 'What Christians do' doesn't change the REALITY of whether something is an ideological issue or not. You're arguing an approach that some take as if it speaks to what is a REALITY.\n \n Look, this approach you're taking of trying to revert everything back to Christians isn't going to work. If you don't want to discuss the issue that we were discussing, you don't have to. \n \n \nBut as for \"convincing someone there is no God\", so what?\n\n \n That wouldn't be a problem if it didn't include the intellectual dis-repect that many atheists include. But alas, that's not the case. Again, find me an atheist--just one--who gives credence to the RELIGIOUS view.\n \n \nBy YOUR standards, I should decide that anybody who thinks homosexuality \"is not normal\" should not receive my vote. Ever.\n Anybody who thinks homosexuality is \"immoral\" should not receive my vote. \n\n \n And in fact I wouldn't find that to be so unreasonable. It's YOU who can't seem to understand laying these sorts of lines down, not me.\n \n \nIf an atheist politician were to convince somebody to be an atheist, SO WHAT?\n\n \n I agree, but that has nothing to do what what I'm saying, and obviously you aren't really listening to what I'm saying.\n \n \n1) It is STEREO-TYPING by your explanation. YOU assume that the atheist is either antagonistic or not as capable of representing Christians.\n\n \n NO. Now I KNOW you're not really listening to what I'm saying.\n \n I'm saying ONE can BETTER represent than the other because one understands better than the other. I have NOT said an atheist \"can't represent\" Christians at all. And again, why should Christians vote for the candidate who's not going to understand them or identify with them as well? Why shoudl the gun owner vote for the candidate who basically against gun use? Why should the gay pride advocate vote for the candidate who gives no credence to the concept of gay pride and associates it with ignorance? You say YOU wouldn't care, but not everyone is so detached from the issues they hold dear, Foundit. And that's NOT prejudice.\n \n Now, do you understand what I'm saying? \n \n No one is saying atheists 'can't represent Christians.' No one is saying they are being antagonistic.\n \n \n2) The PHRASING OF THE QUESTION.\n The question stated that the candidate was:\n a) well-qualified.\n b) already nominated by your party,\n c) and the ONLY other piece of information is that he's an atheist/black/etc, etc.\n\n \n No, \"atheist\" and \"black\" don't belong together, Foundit. Again, one is an ISSUE-based ideological matter; the other is skin color. You CAN'T be against black people without it being prejudice. You certainly CAN be against the atheist position without it being prejudice. \n \n \nI see your excuses as FURTHER EVIDENCE of the prejudice. Stereo-typing based on ignorance IS a part of prejudice.\n\n \n Except, for the reasons I've given, it's not stereotyping. I think you're seeing prejudice out of PRESUMPTION, Foundit. Rather than as a conclusion. Because the reasons you've given for seeing prejudice just don't add up, frankly.\n \n \nAgain, you ignore my words.\n You QUOTE MY WORDS, but you ignore them. To repeat what I said:\n \"... I have REPEATEDLY made it a point to say that if you had an atheist candidate WHO STATED they were politically against religion, or they had a history of being antagonistic towards religion (like limiting religious freedom), I UNDERSTAND and AGREE with an approach of denying that person their vote.\"\n A \"non-political neo-nazi\" WOULD STILL BE \"antagonistic\".\n\n \n And you repeat the same thing over and over as if I haven't addressed that. Let me repeat--\n \n a.)it doesn't have to ONLY be \"political\" in terms of how they are against it, Foundit. No one ever said that was the only grounds on which a candidate can be rejected\n \n b.) politics and everyday views are not so compartmentalized anyway. Nothing ever starts out as political. It becomes political when someone thinks it's crucial enough that they feel their views should apply to other people.\n \n A NON-political nazi would NOT be POITICALLY antagonistic, and your standard is \"political\". So my statement still stands; by your logic we should be just as willing to vote for a NON-political neo-nazi as anyone else.\n \n Now, how many times am I going to have to reiterate this because you ignore what I just said?\n \n \nI find your repeated attempts to instigate conflict between others as fascinating.\n\n \n In what way am I trying to \"instigate conflict\"? All I did was point out that it's not taking place when it typically would be. I find your false accusation to be more fascinating.\n \n \nI find it fascinating that you assert you are for gay rights, but you refuse to engage in conflict with other Christians who are against gay rights.\n\n \n BLOWI. I've engaged in conflict with AA several times. Why do you seem to like so much the idea of Christians being in conflict with Christians? \n \n \nAgain, you need to take a hard look at yourself in the mirror with respect to the standards you espouse. They are unreasonable.\n\n \n Balking at offensiveness and balking and one's lack of credence and respect for another's benign opinion is never unreasonable. Intolerance of intolerance isn't unreasonable at all. Your view on much of atheism is downright naive, really. I think you don't really have any sense that many atheists really flat out don't like religion. If mere \"simple disagreement\" were all that were at play, it wouldn't be a problem.",

Your problem is that you want this election to be a slap in the face to conservatism so you can say liberalism won something. But it wasn't a slap in the face of conservatism. It was still conservatism winning, because it was a reaction against Republicans having moved too far AWAY from true conservatism, and Obama had to say conservative things to do it (tax cuts, no priority of gun control, stopping runaway war spending, not being for gay marriage, etc.) I don't care who it is that's governing as long as they do so in a conservative manner--it could be the Green party for all I care.

Gay rights issues.\n He was NOT \"playing\" himself as a conservative.\n His stance was very \"liberal\".\n \n Would you care to discuss his stance, how he \"played himself up\" on these two issues, and figure out whether it was \"liberal\" or \"conservative\"?\n Somehow, I don't think so...\n\n \n it's interesting that the two issues you want to discuss the most are a couple of issues that Obama pretty much avoided as much as he could, and the news media let him get away with it. He really got a free pass on both these issues, in large part. \n \n What you aren't taking into account is that there are two different areas being discussed here: financial conservatism and SOCIAL conservatism. You're wanting to focus on social conservatism. That's where the religious right has infiltrated the Republicans party, though that is changing. I'm not as concerned about social conservatism in terms of the election. Many of those issues come down to personal views. Obama barely talked about these issues. The reason he didn't is because he didn't want to look like the liberal that his past voting record has shown he is. (Again, candidates have to play themselves off as conservative to get elected.)\n \n \nOne of the funny things about \"conservatism\" is that it redefines itself. It used to be \"liberal\" to be in favor of black equality. It used to be \"liberal\" to be in favor of female equality.\n\n \n It's funny how it's typically mostly liberals who try to define the terms that way. Goldwater conservatism--which IS conservatism in the purest sense of the word--wasn't against black equality at all. Or gender equality.\n \n \nLooking at our last four presidents, the CONSERVATIVE presidents are engaging in overspending and deficit presidencies.\n\n \n Then they weren't being very fiscally conservative, were they? What makes you assume I think the last four presidents were fiscally conservative? you're going on a LOT of unfounded assumptions here.\n \n \nThe problem with your explanation is that for OVER A QUARTER CENTURY conservatives haven't given a damn about a balanced budget.\n So for you to now pretend that balancing a budget is \"acting conservatively\" is kinda funny.\n\n \n That might matter if it were the case that the liberals in government gave a damn about a balanced budget, but they didn't either. I didn't say anything about \"balancing the budget\" by the way. That's something you've just now brought to the table.\n \n \nThrough and through, he IS a liberal. You are trying to falsely claim \"conservative\" where it doesn't deserve the label.\n\n \n How many times am I going to have to tell you that I didn't claim he wasn't? That's NOT what I said. You're still not listening.\n \n \nI do NOT credit the vague \"we\" you are talking about.\n Did you vote for Obama?\n If not, then how could you claim \"we\".\n\n \n No I didn't. But I do support Obama as president as long as he chooses to be president in the conservative way that he campaigned.\n \n \nIt's funny how quickly you switch back and forth inbetween saying \"conservative\" as in value, and trying to assume that conservatives, as in PEOPLE, are the same thing.\n They aren't.\n\n \n Yeah. I guess that's why I said \"conservaTISM\" as opposed to \"conservative.\" Now I KNOW you're not really listening.\n \n \n1) \"stop the war\"?\n Funny how conservatives have been arguing FOR the war, but it's \"conservative\" to stop it.\n Yet again, when conservatives find their position untenuable, they redefine things.\n\n \n Foundit, NEO-CONS support the war. Like Hillary. Like Cheney. They are not conservatives. Conservatives either, a) never supported such exorbitant spending, or b.) came around to realize it was wrong. And frankly, it's not so much just an issue of supporting the war or not; it's an issue of SPENDING. For conservatives like myself, was isn't an issue just 'cause it's war. I'm talking about the war SPENDING. That spending would be just as problematic if all that $ had been thrown into something ELSE. It was too much spending. Certainly not conservative, FISCALLY speaking.\n \n \n2) \"cuts middle class taxes\"?\n How the heck is this \"conservative\"?\n\n \n Tax cuts are almost always conservative, and this is no exception. Taxing is not.\n \n \n3) \"gun control\"?\n That was more hype than anything else.\n\n \n Oh yeah. emoticon_rolleyes I guess that's why the knee jerk AWB happened after Columbine, which was deceptive in that it didn't only ban assault weapons.",

Interesting.\n \n \nNo chance of another bunch of Romish Supreme Court justices, I think.\n\n \n That may be true, but luckily it doesn't look like we'll be having any already constitutionalist justices retiring anytime soon, like Roberts or Alito.\n \n \nAnd if you think Obama is a conservative, can I sell you a bridge in Brooklyn? \n\n \n Again, not what I said.

   "LOL.\n\n I sincerely hope this is a sign that you have moved past the whole \"OMG. Foundit expressed laughter and thus that's an insult.\" passive-aggressive nonsense.\n Either that, or should I remind you of your own standards?\n \n \n \nFoundit, your problem is you apparently don't realize that I'm a conservative in the traditional true sense--NOT a neo-con religious-right conservative (which, as far as I'm concerned, isn't real conservatism). Have you ever heard of Barry Goldwater? He was a good conservative, IMO.\n\n Yes. I have.\n He ACTIVELY pursued gay equality. Not just sitting on his duff and complaining about any move that gays made towards equality.\n \n \n \nIn THIS election, my preference would have been for Ron Paul to win, if that had been feasible.\n\n You voted for McCain, didn't you.\n Later on, you admit you did not vote for Obama.\n So that leaves on \"feasible\" candidate. McCain.\n And now you claim Obama won because he won \"conservatives\", but obviously not you...\n \n Once again, your actions speak louder than your words.\n \n \n \nGoldwater was fine with gay rights for the most part, by the way. As am I. I'm talking about conservatism in the traditional sense of lowered taxes, less regulation and government intrusion, less spending, etc.\n\n \"lowered taxes\"?\n I thought conservatives kept trying to tell us Obama was going to RAISE taxes?\n \n \"less regulation and government intrusion\"?\n Obama is going to dive head-long into the \"health care\" with governmental regulation. That was a big selling point for him.\n Is that another example of how he gave himself as a \"conservative\"?\n \n \"less spending\"?\n Um. Revisit \"health care\" above.\n \n See, your problem is that you give some ideas of \"conservatism\", and then refuse to acknowledge the REAL BIG PICTURE on the issue.\n Cutting taxes. Are liberals AGAINST IT??? NO!\n Gay equal rights with the exception of gay marriage. Are liberals Against THAT? In the big picture, the only part he sways from the \"pure\" liberal perspective is the \"gay marriage\" aspect, but even in that he condemned prop 8\n \n You list the things that he acted \"conservative\" on, but it's a no-brainer list. It's not a list that \"conservatives\" hold any exclusivity to.\n \n \n \nit's interesting that the two issues you want to discuss the most are a couple of issues that Obama pretty much avoided as much as he could, and the news media let him get away with it. He really got a free pass on both these issues, in large part. \n\n It's like you watched this election from a \"bizarro\" world perspective.\n I am listing ways that Obama was DECIDEDLY LIBERAL, and you want to avoid them.\n \n The truth is that he DID NOT \"avoid as much as he could\". In fact, he brought up the gay rights issue IN A BLACK CHURCH SETTING!\n He did not \"avoid\" it. The ECONOMY was just a BIGGER ISSUE.\n And going a step further, the gay rights issue IS A NO-BRAINER. The VAST MAJORITY of the public SUPPORTS gay employment protection. SUPPORTS gays in the military. SUPPORTS hate crime legislation for gays.\n WHY should the media cover \"and in other news, Obama agrees with the vast majority of American citizens on gay equality\" when the economy is going in the toilet?\n \n \n \nWhat you aren't taking into account is that there are two different areas being discussed here: financial conservatism and SOCIAL conservatism. You're wanting to focus on social conservatism.\n\n Wrong.\n I talked about taxes.\n I talked about the Iraq war.\n I talked about financial responsibility.\n \n I have talked about BOTH, so quit misrepresenting the situation.\n \n \n \nObama barely talked about these issues.\n\n That's cause when it came to the ECONOMY, HE WAS WINNING.\n Not because he was being \"conservative\", but rather because he was MAKING SENSE about what was going wrong, and what McCain was failing to address.\n Truth be told, how many liberals are AGAINST a balanced budget?\n How many liberals are AGAINST tax cuts for the middle class?\n How many liberals are AGAINST tax hikes for the upper crust?\n This IS NOT a \"conservative\" stance. At least by not any pretense of exclusivity where he is \"running conservative\" just cause he is talking that way.\n \n By your way of thinking, Obama could have said \"I don't support black slavery\", and you would claim THAT as \"running conservative\"...\n \n But back on \"these issues\", he stated his LIBERAL stance.\n Then, quite frankly, the country talked about WHAT CONCERNED THEM MOST, and the candidates proceeded to talk most about that.\n \n \n \nIt's funny how it's typically mostly liberals who try to define the terms that way. Goldwater conservatism--which IS conservatism in the purest sense of the word--wasn't against black equality at all. Or gender equality.\n\n Before Goldwater's REDEFINITION of \"conservatism\", was the previous generation of \"conservatives\" FOR or AGAINST black equality?\n Were they for or AGAINST gender equality?\n \n You're trying to use a politician who REDEFINED CONSERVATISM to avoid the fact that conservatives redefine conservatism!\n \n \n \nThen they weren't being very fiscally conservative, were they? What makes you assume I think the last four presidents were fiscally conservative? you're going on a LOT of unfounded assumptions here.\n\n Reagan, Bush, and Bush were not fiscally RESPONSIBLE.\n You're trying to insert \"conservative\" in to redefine the word and abscond another ideal.\n It's like Christianity trying to absorb \"Christmas\" all over again!\n \n And like I pointed out, let's look at the FUNCTIONAL DEFINITION of the word instead of you trying to redefine it for your own ideological gain.\n The CONSERVATIVES behave a certain way, over and over and over again.\n And you try to insist that a behavior OPPOSITE of their behavior is actually \"conservative\".\n \n We are in a \"no true scotsman\" territory!\n And truth be told, you're trying to have it both ways!\n You're trying to claim that a behavior that CONSERVATIVES ADOPT AND VOTE FOR is not \"conservative\", but that conservatives prefer YOUR brand of \"conservatism\" that they DO NOT PRACTICE!\n \n \n \nThat might matter if it were the case that the liberals in government gave a damn about a balanced budget, but they didn't either. I didn't say anything about \"balancing the budget\" by the way. That's something you've just now brought to the table.\n\n Rrrrriiiiggghhhhtttt....\n And so when Clinton balanced the budget, that was just an accident...\n \n Once again, you try to redefine the world to fit into your own perspective.\n In twenty or thirty years, when gay marriage is legal in most states, you're going to end up claiming that it's the \"Christian\" way to do things...\n \n \n \nHow many times am I going to have to tell you that I didn't claim he wasn't? That's NOT what I said. You're still not listening.\n\n Again, it is YOU who are not listening.\n You try to pretend he \"acted conservative\" to win votes of conservative PEOPLE who have historically voted FOR CANDIDATES WHO DID NOT HOLD THAT \"conservative\" value...\n \n We are pointing out how he DECISIVELY ACTED LIBERAL, and then you pretend it's not noteworthy to your claim that he \"acted conservative\"...\n \n \n \nNo I didn't. But I do support Obama as president as long as he chooses to be president in the conservative way that he campaigned.\n\n Yeah.\n YOU, the \"conservative\", didn't vote for the guy who you CLAIM was acting \"conservatively\".\n \n Let's look at McCain on these issues.\n The budget. EVERY ECONOMIST who looked at McCain's statements on his \"tax cuts\" looked at it and said he would HAVE TO CUT SPENDING INTENSIVELY in order to not make Bush's deficits look like anthills.\n Was that \"conservative\"?\n \n Can you explain, in your \"Goldwater conservatism\", how who you DID VOTE FOR somehow topped what you claim Obama's \"conservatism\" was???\n \n \n \nFoundit, NEO-CONS support the war. Like Hillary. Like Cheney. They are not conservatives.\n\n Yup.\n No true scotsman!\n By your way of thinking, HOW MANY \"conservatives\" ACTUALLY EXIST in our society???\n \n Cause you are running around trying to pretend that Obama won \"conservative\" votes by acting \"conservative\", but then failing to recognize that your own arguments are effectively ELIMINATING the vast majority of \"conservatives\" as not being \"conservative\" under your definitions...\n \n \n \nConservatives either, a) never supported such exorbitant spending, or b.) came around to realize it was wrong.\n\n So...\n Would you say that people who voted for McCain weren't \"conservative\" then?\n \n \n \nAnd frankly, it's not so much just an issue of supporting the war or not; it's an issue of SPENDING. For conservatives like myself, was isn't an issue just 'cause it's war. I'm talking about the war SPENDING. That spending would be just as problematic if all that $ had been thrown into something ELSE. It was too much spending. Certainly not conservative, FISCALLY speaking.\n\n It's funny how many LIBERALS were complaining about the \"issue of SPENDING\" with regards to the war...\n Just out of curiousity, how many TRUE \"conservatives\" are there in Congress (names of a few would be nice) by YOUR definition of \"conservative\"?\n \n What's really going on here is that the people who SUPPORTED Republicanism are now looking for an excuse to redefine it, and at the same time ignore the fact that they ARE redefining it...\n They are trying to take issues that are common to LIBERAL AND CONSERVATIVE ALIKE, and claim that they are \"conservative\"...\n IGNORING the fact that LIBERALS also hold claim to a lot of what they claim is \"conservative\"...\n \n \n \nTax cuts are almost always conservative, and this is no exception. Taxing is not.\n\n We have moved beyond the \"no true scotsman\" fallacy and further into \"well, that british guy over there is actually a scotsman\"... :xbanghead\n \n \n \nOh yeah. emoticon_rolleyes I guess that's why the knee jerk AWB happened after Columbine, which was deceptive in that it didn't only ban assault weapons.\n\n \"AWB\"?",

Liberals ALWAYS have to look conservative to get elected. Conversely, conservatives usually have to get liberal to get elected, if they're too far to the right. It's called moving to the center, Foundit. And it's a normal part of politics. You just don't get it. \n \n \nCutting taxes. Are liberals AGAINST IT??? NO!\n\n \n Er, yes, they often are!

It's an inherently conservative ideal to want to protect people from the government intruding on their lives or not giving them liberty. The idea you're putting forth that conservatism = opposition to blacks is the revisionism here. It's only since the RR invaded conservatives that this idea has become prevalent, and even then it's somewhat of a political misrepresentation of the situation. What evidence do you have PRE-Goldwater that conservatism was associated with being against black equality?\n \n \nYou're trying to use a politician who REDEFINED CONSERVATISM to avoid the fact that conservatives redefine conservatism!\n\n \n Why do you assume Goldwater was a redefinition? Um, no, the religious right redefined conservatism.\n \n \nReagan, Bush, and Bush were not fiscally RESPONSIBLE.\n\n \n I already told you, I didn't say they were. You're going on some pretty glaring presumptions to assume I think those presidents were paragons of conservatism.\n \n \nAnd like I pointed out, let's look at the FUNCTIONAL DEFINITION of the word instead of you trying to redefine it for your own ideological gain.\n\n \n Foundit, that's what YOU'RE doing. I'm just going by what has traditionally been the conservative's priorities.

It never does; it was two candidates trying to look conservative.\n\n When you define \"conservative\" in such ridiculously ambiguous ways whereby BOTH CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERALS are for the items in question, it's not an issue of \"trying to look conservative\".\n BOTH liberals and conservatives want tax cuts. Are you telling me that liberals want to pay HIGHER taxes???\n Well gee. NOTHING is stopping them from doubling their income tax and donating it to the government.\n That is NOT an issue of \"trying to look conservative\".\n \n I think I'll claim \"don't want blacks to be slaves\" as a \"LIBERAL\" idea, and therefore say that McCain was \"trying to look liberal\" in not wanting blacks to be slaves.\n Makes about as much sense as the wool you're trying to pull...\n \n \n \nBOTH didn't want to look like big spenders.\n\n Obama's health care plan.

As what conservatives say about him? Interesting! \n\n No.\n The point is that conservatives do NOT define him as YOU try to define him.\n It's like asking other Scotsman if an individual is \"Scottish\". The fact that they unilaterally agree his \"position\" is NOT \"conservative\" is noteworthy.\n \n \n \nHealth care was NOT the \"big selling point\". Do you really think most conservatives who voted for Obama did so because of his stance on health care? Um, no.\n\n I think most conservatives voted for Obama cause he was a better candidate.\n NOT because he was conservative or tried to appear \"conservative\".\n They were presented with a situation of four more years of Bush, and they would rather have SOMEBODY ELSE in office rather than four more years of Bush.\n That's what I think regarding the Obama conservative vote.\n \n And regarding \"Health care was NOT the \"big selling point\".\", you're avoiding the point.\n You claim Obama was \"acting conservative\", but I am pointing out ways that he was DEFINITIVELY NOT acting conservative.\n \n Are you telling me that you think conservatives fixated on ways they thought they could claim Obama as \"conservative\", ignoring the REAL conservative candidate in the race, and that's how it went???\n Moreover, considering YOU didn't even vote for Obama, I find your opinion of the motivations for why people did vote for Obama to be speculation at best.\n A bit like a straight guy trying to tell a gay guy his motivation for doing something...\n \n \n \nHealthcare is pretty much your one-trick pony in trying to deny that Obama had to come across as more conservative to get elected.\n\n BLOWI.\n Irredeemable BLOWI.\n I have pointed out the Iraq war. I have pointed out taxation (he wants to RAISE taxes on the rich, remember). I have pointed out his gay rights stance. I have pointed out his stance on the economy.\n I can add on his BUSINESS tax ideas as well.\n Hardly \"one trick\" at all.\n \n \n \nFrankly, you get into these situations often, Foundit, where you end up arguing against rather normal, basic stuff that pretty much anyone would agree with that wasn't trying to just be disagreeable as you are.\n\n lol.\n This coming from the guy who REFUSES to admit the anti-gay organizational link to Christianity???\n And quite frankly, can you name me ANYBODY who agrees with you here?\n To be more precise and poignant, any conservative?\n \n You are presuming you have agreement, but I see none.\n \n \n \nLiberals ALWAYS have to look conservative to get elected. Conversely, conservatives usually have to get liberal to get elected, if they're too far to the right. It's called moving to the center, Foundit. And it's a normal part of politics. You just don't get it.\n\n Jyoshu, the problem with your statement is \"looking\" ...\n Also, the ISSUES INVOLVED in what you claim \"looking conservative\" is...\n \n I have already pointed out that liberals DO NOT want their taxes raised. \"Lowering Taxes\" IS NOT a mantra exclusive to the \"conservatives\".\n It's an idea that EVERYBODY likes. Paying less!\n \n Another problem is the SPECIFICS. You keep trying to make arguments VAGUE in an attempt to win points, but when it comes to SPECIFICS, you're lousy at it. Here, I can name NUMEROUS issues on which Obama is clearly LIBERAL, but you ignore them to harp on \"tax cuts\" which has no exclusivity to conservatives.\n \n \n \nEr, yes, they often are! Are seriously trying to make the case here that liberals are more or lowering taxes than conservatives???\n\n Your sentence is rather garbled.\n Here is what liberals want. They typically appeal to middle to lower income. They want THEIR taxes lowered, and the \"rich\" to shoulder more of the burden.\n And SURPRISE! That is EXACTLY what Obama did!\n \n \n \nYou list the things that he acted \"conservative\" on, but it's a no-brainer list. It's not a list that \"conservatives\" hold any exclusivity to.\n\n \nDidn't say they did.\n\n Don't you get it?\n Unless the conservatives have exclusivity on the topic, as in the liberals want the OPPOSITE to happen, then you HAVE NO CLAIM.\n If BOTH conservatives AND liberals want the same thing on that issue, then it is not an issue of \"acting conservative\".\n \n \n \nIt's all about emphasis. If you think liberals aren't for gay marriage more than conservatives...\n\n CLAFCLO...\n I never said anything about \"liberals aren't for gay marriage more than conservatives\".\n And I have already pointed out Obama CONDEMNED PROP 8.\n Is THAT \"conservative\"?\n I would say decidedly NO since you keep avoiding that point! \n \n \n \n... or that they are typically more about lowering taxes, I have to swamp land for you at a good price ...\n\n Actually, the \"lowering taxes\" would be an issue where the \"conservatives\" ACT MORE LIBERAL to appeal to liberals.\n The upper crust want their taxes lowered. But they can't get that in a democratic-imitating society if they do not give the majority (including the liberals) what they want.\n Liberals DO NOT want their taxes raised.\n They DO NOT want the upper rich crust to have their taxes lowered while the liberals are taxed at the same amount.\n \n \n \nThey were FOR it.\n\n Most of the anti-black bigotry STILL comes from the Republican party. The \"party of Lincoln\" went a variety of metamorpheses before today, and even then it's arguable over WHY Lincoln wanted slaves freed.\n Would you care to review ACTUAL VOTING RECORDS on black equality legislation?\n I know the Southern Democrats had a lot of racism, but they didn't hold a candle to the racism of the Republican party in opposing black equality legislation. In comparing the PERCENTAGE of the Democrat anti-black vote, to the PERCENTAGE of the Republican anti-black vote, the Republicans are clearly more racist.\n \n \n \nIt's an inherently conservative ideal to want to protect people from the government intruding on their lives or not giving them liberty.\n\n Considering even YOU have problems applying YOUR OWN standards unilaterally (like to yourself), it's no surprise that the Republicans aren't exactly even-handed in their approach.\n Take the Republican voting rights scandals in the last election. How they tried to \"intrude\" on the lives of private citizens with their right to vote...\n You're white-washing the situation...\n \n \n \nThe idea you're putting forth that conservatism = opposition to blacks is the revisionism here.\n\n Do you seriously want to look at some voting records with regards to Democrat / Republican dividing lines?\n It won't be pretty.\n And as long as you repeat your claim, it doesn't matter how many times you ignore my response I will keep coming back with it...\n \n \n \nIt's only since the RR invaded conservatives that this idea has become prevalent, and even then it's somewhat of a political misrepresentation of the situation.\n\n And WHEN do you think the RR supposedly \"invaded conservatives\"?\n Give me a time-frame...\n \n \n \nWhy do you assume Goldwater was a redefinition? Um, no, the religious right redefined conservatism.\n\n Why do you think \"Goldwater\" is so PROMINENT in history regarding \"Goldwater conservatism\"?\n Do you think history would have noted him if he were sticking to the SAME conservatism that other conservatives were utilizing at that time???\n \n \n \nI already told you, I didn't say they were. You're going on some pretty glaring presumptions to assume I think those presidents were paragons of conservatism.\n\n And you are in \"no true Scotsman\" country again...\n The CONSERVATIVE presidents who CONSERVATIVES voted for...\n \n \n \nFoundit, that's what YOU'RE doing.\n\n And we're back in the \"I know you are but what am I?\" lame response situation.\n NO. I am defining it BY a FUNCTIONAL definition.\n CONSERVATIVISM as defined by the CONSERVATIVE application of policies and politics.\n I have no idea how you could even think of accusing me of doing what you're doing.\n \n \n \nI'm just going by what has traditionally been the conservative's priorities. You just don't want to give conservatism any credence. \n\n BLOWI.\n This is about recognizing what is REALLY going on.\n \n I personally think Goldwater's \"definition\" has a lot of promise. A few good ideas.\n But it is improper to conjure up the antiquated interpretation, ignore how people have TRULY APPLIED conservatism over the years, and then pretend that it was somehow \"conservative all along\".\n \n I personally hope that \"conservatism\" will undergo a revolution in thinking. I WANT them to realize that \"gay rights\" are none of their bigotted business.\n But I'm not going to sit back and pretend that \"conservatism\" hasn't OVERTLY made a point of making anti-gay rights a voting platform issue.\n I will not sit back for that lie and be silent.\n \n You CHANGE conservatism, then you'll get credit.\n As it is, you CANNOT change conservatism, so you're trying to weasel sleazy credit off of a LIBERAL getting elected.\n \n \n \nYet again, more evidence you aren't listening to what I'm saying. I already told you I'd have preferred to vote for Ron Paul.\n\n Non-sequitur.\n I didn't ask you who you would have preferred.\n I asked why you voted for MCCAIN OVER OBAMA, if Obama was \"acting like\" the conservatism you CLAIM to want.\n \n The truth of the matter is simple.\n Not even you really stick to the \"Goldwater conservatism\".\n \n \n \nIn the grand scheme of things, all issues considered, I think McCain IS more conservative than Obama. I never said he wasn't.\n\n And there it is...\n The admission that was long in coming, and pulling teeth to get...\n There was a MORE conservative candidate on the ballot, but supposedly Obama won by \"acting conservative\".\n \n That's like saying you have two diet drinks. One has 10 calories. The second has 50 calories.\n Somebody chooses the SECOND drink, and then Jyoshu comes along and claims the second drink won by \"acting like a diet drink\".\n WRONG-O!\n \n The person who chose the second drink, if he were going off of \"diet\" parameters, would have chosen the FIRST.\n Obviously, there was SOMETHING ELSE the second candidate had going for him that won the day.\n \n \n \nSo I didn't vote for Obama. But neither RAN as a liberal. They BOTH tried to come across as conservative. That's what candidates have to do.\n\n Yeah.\n Obama was VERY conservative in fighting for EVERY GAY RIGHT ON THE BOOKS but gay marriage. And even then, he ACTIVELY CONDEMNED gay marriage.\n Obama was \"conservative\" in supporting the bailouts. No. Scratch that cause the truth is that supporting the bailouts is something LIBERALS support, and the REAL conservatives are angry that Bush and McCain are ACTING LIKE LIBERALS in supporting the bailout actions.\n Obama wants us out of Iraq. VERY \"conservative\" issue that most conservatives ACTUALLY DISAPPROVE of.\n \n I could go on and on and on.\n And you'll ignore every point I make.\n Instead, you'll \"BLOWI\" and comment on only one claiming it's a \"one-trick pony\"...\n \n \n \nIf they were against runaway spending, how is that NOT a truly conservative ideal? They are wanting to [i]conserve[i] $.\n\n Actually, they are liberal in wanting liberal amounts of saving.\n (two people can play meaningless semantic games...)",

   "Apparently someone doesn't understand the difference in calling someone a name and pointing out behavior. Ironic since \"pointing out behavior\" is one of the favorite excuses he likes to invoke ...\n\n 1) When you say \"someone\", were you talking about the admin? emoticon_frazzled\n 2) \"Pointing out behavior\" in talking about how many posts you average in the \"gay threads\" in a week is not an insult.\n Saying \"behaving like a jerk\" is an incredibly thin excuse for an insult.\n \n 3) Beyond exposing how shallow your \"insult\" complaints are, we both know how thin that excuse you are trying to use is.\n Whether or not you want to admit it, others can SEE FOR THEMSELVES.\n If the admin were to allow such behavior, you and I could both start talking about how the other person \"was behaving\", and I guess as long as we both put \"was behaving\" in front of the insults you supposedly wouldn't have a problem with it? emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \nYou're certainly no newbie to online forums, so don't play your games here that you don't know capital letters mean 'shouting' online. Do you yell as much (use all capital letters a lot) at people as moderator in the other forum you are often on?\n\n I use capitals to focus attention.\n If you interpret it as \"shouting\", that's your nitpicking.\n \n And it would do well for you to refrain from discussing other people's personal behavior on other forums, unless you're saying that YOUR BEHAVIOR on other forums is somehow free game? emoticon_rolleyes\n Naw. Didn't think so... \n \n \n \nAnd you'll be called out for hostility again if you start that junk up. (The CLAFCLO's and BLOWI's are often BLOWIs themselves.) You certainly have calmed it down some though.\n\n I have no doubt that when you need an excuse to run to, you'll start in with your passive-aggressive rants.\n I have repeatedly CHALLENGED YOU TO DEFEND your claims that I was acting with \"hostility\", but you routinely duck such substantiation of your claims.\n And like I said, OTHERS CAN SEE THROUGH your claims also...\n So what you try to \"call out\", while you call me a jerk and call for me to be banished from this forum, is immaterial to me.\n \n \n \nObviously you don't. The fact I voted for McCain has nothing to do whatsoever with whether Obama campaigned more conservatively than he really is.\n\n Ahhh.\n This is an intriguing attempt to move the goal-posts.\n So you are now arguing that he MISREPRESENTED himself?\n Proof?\n \n \n \nThis whole thing of 'who I voted for' is a complete red herring. It's like saying you want to buy a green car. You found two of them--one a forest green, and one a light green. Just because you choose the deeper green doesn't mean the other wasn't green. I never made the claim that Obama was as conservative as McCain.\n\n No. You didn't.\n But you DO demonstrate that Obama WAS NOT \"conservative\" enough to gain your vote, and that is rather significant.\n \n The point is clear. Your claims of Obama's \"conservatism\" are shallow, and when it came to your own vote, you VOTED ELSEWHERE.\n So this pretense of Obama \"acting conservate\" in order to gain votes is shown false as it obviously did not gain EVEN YOUR vote.\n \n I believe I already challenged you for substantiation on how many votes Obama supposedly gained by his \"conservative\" approach...\n I guess we'll see if you responded, or just ignored it...\n \n \n \nWell how else would you differentiate them, Foundit, other than areas of emphasis? One tends emphasize lower taxes, the other emphasizes other things. Let me guess ... the way you'd differentiate them is some way that makes conservatives look evil, right? :) \n\n Quit with the strawmen. They gain you nothing other than obvious obfuscation.\n And why do you ask such a pointless question.\n My standard is clear. When BOTH conservative AND liberal want the SAME THING, no group gets \"claim\" to that behavior.\n How many liberals do you think would have voted for Obama if he had said \"I'm going to raise your taxes\"?\n Answer: Ridiculously few.\n \n I think the conservatives \"emphasize\" it because they are more interested in greed. When the government helps people, and looks for tax money to be able to pay for it, the conservatives are quick to say \"I gave at the office\".\n Liberals are more responsible in footing the bill. Less greedy.\n \n \n \nFrankly, your complaint here is so absurd that there's no way anyone could ever use any standards for the terms \"conservative\" or \"liberal.\" Apparently you think they are pretty much all the same thing.\n\n That has got to be one of the MOST ABSURD things you have ever said.\n I mean, mind-BOGGLINGLY ridiculous.\n Anybody can look at my previous statements and see I HAVE BEEN differentiating between conservative and liberal ALL OVER THE PLACE!\n \n Iraq war. Conservatives want to stay and play. Liberals want out.\n Gay rights. Conservatives don't want to change any discrimination against gays (if not add some more). Liberals want gay equality.\n Health Care. Conservatives are like \"what problem?\" Liberals want governmental involvement to address the issue.\n \n Need I go on?\n You think my complaint is absurd?\n Your reply is absurd!\n There are OBVIOUS WAYS we can differentiate between the two.\n It's just that we cannot claim an approach is \"conservative\" or \"liberal\" when BOTH GROUPS WANT THE SAME THING.\n \n \n \nRiiiight. I guess that's why Biden is on record recently making the case that \"paying taxes is patriotic!\" You'd be willing to compare how many times liberals were for cutting taxes as opposed to conservatives? Seriously?\n\n Big picture Jyoshu. Don't fixate on the leaf to ignore the forest...\n He was talking about Obama's plan to raise taxes ON THE RICH.\n And like I said, that is decidedly \"liberal\".\n \n \n \nNope, not Blowi.\n\n Yes. BLOWI.\n You claimed I was a \"one-trick pony\".\n I have a whole stable full of arguments.\n THAT is your BLOWI.\n \n \n \nCan you name another election in recent history where the Democratic candidate wanted to cut taxes on the middle class? I bet you can't.\n\n Oh give me a freakin' break.\n THIS election had OTHER examples!\n Hillary herself wanted to CUT THE GAS TAX to \"help Americans\" during the summer.\n \n I think you need to provide an example where the Democratic candidate argued he was going to RAISE taxes.\n \n \n \nAs far as your other examples of the Iraq war and gay rights, I've already dealt with those.\n\n Yeah. With the tried and true \"no true scotsman\" fallacy.\n What I find hilarious is how you \"quote\" me, but I have NOT ONCE seen you actually respond to the fact that I point out you are committing a \"no true scotsman\" fallacy.\n You cut and paste around what you don't want to address.\n \n \n \nObama said he's against gay marriage, the biggest gay-rights issue on the table these days!\n\n No. It is not.\n Gay employment protection. Gays in the military. Gay adoption. Gay hate crime laws.\n THOSE need to be addressed first.\n And like I keep pointing out, but OF COURSE you cut-and-paste around it, Obama was AGAINST PROP 8!\n \n \n \nOf course for a DNC candidate to say that is always going to be a glass-half-full to you as opposed to to a glass half-empty.\n\n And on this, I have to laugh...\n You complain that the Democrats are not for gay marriage, but then you turn around and proclaim that they have to be that way otherwise they are conservative...\n Once again, REFUSING TO RECOGNIZE the FUNCTIONAL definition.\n \n \n \nThe Iraq War? Sure, I'll grant you Obama was more conservative on that one in terms of spending.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n I can't help it. You are REPEATEDLY employing SEMANTICS to avoid acknowledging the truth of the matter.\n Obama was LIBERAL in PROTESTING AGAINST the Iraq war.\n But you ignore that, and say he was \"conservative on spending\".\n Like I said, I'll just call it \"liberal on savings\" to expose how ridiculous your claim is.\n \n \n \nI really do think most would agree that candidates have to come to the middle to get elected.\n\n Like I pointed out earlier, that is NOT what my argument is against.\n Quit moving the goal-posts.\n \n \n \nWhat the heck are you even talking about here?\n\n You lost track of what we were talking about.\n You made comments trying to refute the issue of Republicanism and racism.\n You THEN tried to turn around and cite some Republican \"values\" to try to end-run the fact that my observations were DEAD-ON.\n After that, you AGAIN CUT-AND-PASTE around the entire issue, but then when you got to this portion you forgot what it was you were trying to avoid.\n Case in point on Republican hypocrisy. They supposedly want government out of private lives, but the Republicans have supported some of the LARGEST invasions (and violations) against the constitutional rights in the interests of \"war on terror\".\n FUNCTIONALLY defining the situation, instead of trying to rely on ideals.\n Otherwise, just admit how grotesquely hypocritical the Republicans are being, but DO NOT try to use the \"ideal\" to avoid the violation of said ideal.\n \n \n \nAnd BLOWI on you for your 'standards' comment. Explain what you mean if you're going to make the claim, but I know of no area where my standard isn't consistent.\n\n Already explained in the other thread. You apply standards to atheists that you refuse to follow yourself.\n And also in this one, where you call me a name and complain over \"insults\".\n And this last one was proven even more hypocritical, as you tried to DEFEND your insult, instead of apologizing or retracting.\n \n \n \nLike I said, you only mainly want to talk about the ONE side of thing--social conservatism.\n\n BLOWI.\n Iraq war. Economy. Taxes.\n At this stage, I have no idea why you keep trying to pretend this conversation is only about \"social conservatism\"...\n \n \n \nDon't give me that. you know good and well the time frame the religious right started taking over the Republican party--it was beginning about the time Goldwater lost (although you claim Goldwater's views were a redefinion--a claim for which you give no proof.\n\n Why are Goldwater's \"standards\" so noteworthy then?\n If he was supposedly a \"conservative\" supposedly LIKE OTHER CONSERVATIVES of his time, then HOW did his \"conservative\" approach gain any noteworthiness?\n \n \n \nWhat functional definition?\n\n How is it that I can EXPLAIN how I am functionally defining something, and then you turn around and proclaim that you don't know what I am functionally defining???\n HOW does that work?\n \n Let me repeat myself...Reagan, Bush, and Bush were not fiscally RESPONSIBLE.\n You're trying to insert \"conservative\" in to redefine the word and abscond another ideal.\n It's like Christianity trying to absorb \"Christmas\" all over again!\n And like I pointed out, let's look at the FUNCTIONAL DEFINITION of the word instead of you trying to redefine it for your own ideological gain.Using a FUNCTIONAL definition of \"conservatism\" approach to financials, you can see the last three \"conservative\" presidents were fiscally irresponsible.\n And looking at McCain's recommendations, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ON TRACK with yet another term of having his spending outrun his taxing.\n \n Now, you may have your own ANTIQUATED ideals of how a \"conservative\" SHOULD run.\n But by your standards, you would declare OUR PREVIOUS \"conservative\" presidents as not being conservative.\n In which case, I guess we have to say that when Reagan, Bush, and Bush were elected, CONSERVATIVES LOST.\n \n Cause that's the flip side of your \"no true scotsman\" fallacy. You are saying our PREVIOUS \"conservative\" presidents weren't truly \"conservative\" at all.\n \n \n \nThat's the thing. You seem to be asserting my approach is arbitrary, but your view is even more arbitrary! At least I'm going by some standard.\n\n Earth to Jyoshu.\n I am using a \"standard\" as well.\n FUNCTIONAL.\n Going off of how conservatives ACTUALLY BEHAVE instead of placating to your \"no true scotsman\" ideology.\n \n \n \nI have yet to figure out what standard for defining 'conservatives' you use--you reject out of hand any traditional conservative emphasis I say! (lowering taxes, for instance) Instead you seem to be saying liberals are about that too.\n\n Gee.\n So when I explained how conservatives behaved on gay rights issues, Iraq war, economy, and other issues, I obviously gave you NOTHING to \"figure out\" what I was saying about how conservatives act...\n \n \n \nSo you reject conservatives in defining themselves ... what standard are you going by, then? \n\n WRONG.\n I reject YOU EXCLUSIVELY defining \"conservatism\" TO THE CONTRADICTION of how conservatives actually act.\n How many times are you going to cut \"No True Scotsman Fallacy\" out of my posts Jyoshu?\n How many times?\n \n \n \nCLAFCLO.\n\n No. You're taking me out of context.\n I was talking about what I was not going to do.\n I never made any pretense about what YOU were not going to do.\n \n \n \nNo one said you have to do that, and it has nothing to do with whether the views of the people you're talking about are truly conservative or not.\n\n Thanks for completely ignoring my context and saying what my comment had nothing to do with.\n My comment ALSO had nothing to do with the price of tea in China, or with the temperature of horse manure freshly made.\n \n What my point DID have to do was refuting your claim that this was just about \"anti-conservatism\" on my part.\n I WILL credit conservatism WHEN it does good.\n Unlike you, I will NOT credit conservatism for actions it has no real claim to in the first place.\n \n \n \nWhat the heck are you carrying on about now??? No one's trying to 'weasel credit' off anything. Besides, you said yourself earlier that you'd grant that conservatives helped elect Obama.\n\n < bangs head against wall <\n Yes. Conservatives VOTED for Obama, but NOT because he was passing himself off as a conservative.\n As I already explained, it's cause they didn't want four more years of Bush-lite.\n \n The item of contention is WHAT YOU CLAIM conservatism deserves credit for. Your whole \"win for conservatism\" junk.\n \n \n \nThe the question speaks to nothing. Because voting comes down to preferences and often what one considers the lesser of two evils. Don't act like you don't know this.\n\n emoticon_frazzled\n \"don't know this\"?\n It is PART OF MY ARGUMENT for why conservatives REALLY VOTED FOR Obama in the first place.\n \n \n \nemoticon_xdonno Oh please. Nothing to 'admit to.' Your \"accusation\" has nothing substantive to do with anything. It's pointless.\n\n lol!\n I point out an area where we have agreement, and glad that you finally came to that agreement, and you obfuscate...\n Did you just realize that you didn't want to admit to that in the first place? emoticon_frazzled\n Your bad...",

   "1) When you say \"someone\", were you talking about the admin? emoticon_frazzled\n\n \n No, no the admin. You.\n \n \nIf the admin were to allow such behavior, you and I could both start talking about how the other person \"was behaving\",\n \n and I guess as long as we both put \"was behaving\" in front of the insults you supposedly wouldn't have a problem with it?\n\n \n Foundit, there's rarely a post of yours that doesn't go by in which you don't talk about the messenger as opposed to the message at least some. And it's usually about how their acting, or posting, or something to that effect. You're continuing that trend in this thread, even now. I'm MORE than happy to have a rule between us that says we can't talk about the other PERSON or their behavior, but frankly you'd be guilty of it almost every time you post. It's apparently that you'd never be able to do it. So you have no room to complain here about this, whatsoever. \n \n \nAhhh.\n This is an intriguing attempt to move the goal-posts.\n So you are now arguing that he MISREPRESENTED himself?\n Proof?\n\n \n Say whaa? No, it means the issue of who I voted for has NADA to do with with whether or not McCain OR Obama was conservative in the way they campaigned. No one is saying anyone misrepresented anything. You're on some wild goose chase here, Foundit. And it's taking you nowhere.\n \n \nBut you DO demonstrate that Obama WAS NOT \"conservative\" enough to gain your vote, and that is rather significant.\n\n \n Well golly gee, I had no idea my vote was so important in determining whether a candidate is pandering back to the middle--moving more conservatively. Aw 'shucks' .... sure is neat how you feel I'm so important though! :p \n \n See, the \"conservativeness\" or \"liberalness\" of a candidate is there, or not, independent of whether a given person votes for them or not. There are a plethora of reasons a person might vote for a candidate other than that.\n \n \nThe point is clear. Your claims of Obama's \"conservatism\" are shallow, and when it came to your own vote, you VOTED ELSEWHERE.So this pretense of Obama \"acting conservate\" in order to gain votes is shown false as it obviously did not gain EVEN YOUR vote.\n \n\n \n Yeah, big whoopin' deal .... why, the dark green car appealed more to me than the lighter green car. emoticon_rolleyes Guess that proves one of them wasn't green, huh? :xdunno: I seriously wonder how many people out there fit this apparent idea of yours of all-or-nothing voting--I suspect very few, if anyone. Politics just aren't that oversimplistic, Foundit.\n \n \nI believe I already challenged you for substantiation on how many votes Obama supposedly gained by his \"conservative\" approach...\n\n \n Well, you already admitted some conservatives voted for him, and I believe you even applauded them for it. Your question is another example of a pointless one; no one has claimed he needed or got a given amount of votes for having a more conservative approach and coming to the center (as all presidential candidates do! That's the thing, you're making the biggest deal out of this, when it's something that's common knowledge that candidates do in a general campaign).\n \n \nQuit with the strawmen. They gain you nothing other than obvious obfuscation.\n And why do you ask such a pointless question.\n My standard is clear. When BOTH conservative AND liberal want the SAME THING, no group gets \"claim\" to that behavior.\n\n \n Then what IS your standard for one and the other? Because you still haven't really answered that. You want to denounce any standard I'm putting forth (which happen to be the traditional standards that is associated with conservatism), but you don't tell what standard you're going by. Again, if conservatives and liberals want the same thing, then there should be no differentiating the two. Everybody's the same!! \n \n \nI think the conservatives \"emphasize\" it because they are more interested in greed. When the government helps people, and looks for tax money to be able to pay for it, the conservatives are quick to say \"I gave at the office\".\n Liberals are more responsible in footing the bill. Less greedy.\n\n \n And there it is. In all its glory.\n \n Just as I suspected .... your criteria is based on 'conservatism = bad\". Liberalism = Good!\" I'd have problem with the latter, in that I'm willing to say BOTH are benign in terms of what conservatism and liberalism is.\n \n Problem is, you only want to focus on the evil, dastardly baby-eating 'conservatives' (which you've come to think of as a four letter word) and aren't willing to actually consider what conservatism really is or has ever been. Hence your insistence on \"functional\" definition (emoticon_rolleyes), which is just Foundit-speak for ONLY wanting to define conservatism by those evil, dastadly neo-cons.\n \n It's funny how on one hand you get ticked off that someone is associating higher taxes with liberals, then you turn around and commit the very same sort of thing with associating conservatives with 'greed'. There's no difference really; it all comes down to ideology and the fact one group thinks the other is wrong / they themselves right. Which is why I think the only way to at least approach objectivity in such a conversation as this is to discuss the \"ISMs\"--the ideology itself--and stop with this presumption toward either that 'it's evil' to begin with. These \"isms\" have to have SOME definition to them. They have to have some traditional sense of emphasis. I have no problem saying 'liberalism' in it's pure form is fine, in terms of some of the things it traditionally champions. The same goes for conservatism. That reality is there, no matter how much you point to conservatives who have given it a bad name, just as some of the liberals down through the years have given liberalism a bad name.\n \n \nThat has got to be one of the MOST ABSURD things you have ever said.\n I mean, mind-BOGGLINGLY ridiculous.\n Anybody can look at my previous statements and see I HAVE BEEN differentiating between conservative and liberal ALL OVER THE PLACE!\n\n \n And yet no clear standards on what you view conservatism to REPRESENT. That's what I'm looking for here, but you're avoiding it like the plague.\n \n \nOh give me a freakin' break.\n THIS election had OTHER examples!\n Hillary herself wanted to CUT THE GAS TAX to \"help Americans\" during the summer.\n\n \n Er, Hillary has LONG been considered by many to be a 'conservative Democrat.'\n \n \nOnce again, REFUSING TO RECOGNIZE the FUNCTIONAL definition.\n\n \n \"Functional\" definition? What the heck is that supposed to mean, anyway? You have yet to even given standards for how you would determine conservatism or liberalism--other than some parade of horribles that you blame conservatives for. It's interesting what's happening here. You take issue with labels that might be inferred about liberalism here, but then have no problem associating bad things with conservatism rather than any good things. \n \n \nROFLMAO!\n I can't help it. You are REPEATEDLY employing SEMANTICS to avoid acknowledging the truth of the matter.\n Obama was LIBERAL in PROTESTING AGAINST the Iraq war.\n\n \n So then no traditional views of what conservatism emphasizes even exists, in your thinking? When someone protests exorbitant spending, as in this example of the war, it's not conservative? Sorry, that's just rather silly. Obama may HAVE protested against it for reasons traditionally associated with liberalism, but that's not what I'm talking about. The examples I've used are opposing the exorbitant SPENDING on the war (Or any OTHER endeavor would cost). This is NOT about just being anti-war because of the old hippie idea of \"make love, not war.\" The idea that war is just arbitrarily wrong is a flat-out over-simplication to the Nth degree, but even if it weren't, that's not what I'm talking about. \n \n \nBut you ignore that, and say he was \"conservative on spending\".\n Like I said, I'll just call it \"liberal on savings\" to expose how ridiculous your claim is.\n\n \n And I might as well also say no traditional areas of emphasis of liberalism are really distinct either by claiming that a conservative is for individual rights when he champions privacy issues (E.g. Bob Barr). You're being absurd in not tolerating any traditional idea here of what conservatism emphasizes. People have to think of these terms in the sense of SOME standards of emphasis, or else the terms might as well not exist, and everyone's of the same goals in terms of emphasis. Which clearly isn't the case.\n \n \nAlready explained in the other thread. You apply standards to atheists that you refuse to follow yourself.\n\n \n Sigh. I can't believe you're still stuck on that. Talk about two completely different discussions ....\n \n \nWhy are Goldwater's \"standards\" so noteworthy then?\n\n \n They aren't. The only reason Goldwater usually gets brought up is because if ANTI-conservatives, not conservatives. (Though in this thread, I did bring him up, but only in response to claims you made.) I think he's just following in the views that traditional conservatism is all about. Certainly nothing revolutionary in terms of conservatism. I think the real problem here is that you want to conflate NEOCONs with conservatism. You want to portray conservatism as defined by NEOCONs, which you hate, rather than by any traditional areas of emphasis that conservatism entails. Neo-cons are a DEPARTURE from conservatism in it's true sense. That's not any no-true-scottsman fallacy, so don't start that up. Political ideologies have emphasis standards, Foundit, no matter how much you want to avoid that reality for the purposes of conflating things here.\n \n So here's a couple of questions to think about ...\n \n do you not think Ron Paul is a real conservative? Because that's the direction your logic goes, since you won't accept traditional ideas of conservatism as any sort of definition. \n \n \nLet me repeat myself...[indent]Reagan, Bush, and Bush were not fiscally RESPONSIBLE.\n\n \n And let me repeat myself, for the 3rd time ...\n \n I did NOT say they were. \n \n Using people that clearly weren't conservative in terms of spending isn't exactly going to be convincing as legitimate examples on your part, now is it?\n \n \nIt's like Christianity trying to absorb \"Christmas\" all over again!\n\n \n I think you really need to simply take your lessons from Linus, Foundit. [Nativity Story] -< \"That's what Christmas is all about, Charlie Brown!\") :)\n \n Christmas doesn't need to be 'absorbed again' by Christians. It's a Christian holiday, pure and simple, EVEN THOUGH many don't observe it for Christian reasons or have commercialized it.\n \n Your example helps my argument more than yours.\n \n \nEarth to Jyoshu.\n I am using a \"standard\" as well.\n FUNCTIONAL.\n Going off of how conservatives ACTUALLY BEHAVE instead of placating to your \"no true scotsman\" ideology.\n\n \n So if a liberal behaves badly, it means there are no standards by which we think of real liberalism? We should define liberalism ONLY in terms of liberals that didn't behave well, like, say, Lenin and Stalin??? I REALLY don't think you want to go there. \n \n Are you just not willing at all to think of terms like liberalism and conservatism in terms of traditional definition in regards to what they emphasize? Because if you're not--and therefore unwilling to even work here from a rather BASIC approach to even have a consersation--there's no reason in continuing this. It's like trying to have conversation about the religion of Islam, and someone refusing to even talk about it in terms of the basic tenets of the religion, instead ONLY defining it by Islamic radicals. This approach is absolutely absurd on your part!!!\n \n \nYes. Conservatives VOTED for Obama, but NOT because he was passing himself off as a conservative.\n As I already explained, it's cause they didn't want four more years of Bush-lite.\n\n \n And why, pray tell, do you think these conservatives rejected Bush in this way, Foundit? You're not thinking this through, at all ... \n \n Bush has abandoned conservatism in any traditional sense. THAT'S why. He's thrown privacy out the window. He's throw conservative spending out the window. He's weakened our military. He's spent so much money that sooner or later we're going to likely have to raise taxes to make it up. \n \n Oh, I forgot. Traditional views of these terms don't matter to you--'conservatism', 'liberalism': it's all the same emphasis to you. Only what you think are current \"functional\" definitions. emoticon_rolleyes",
