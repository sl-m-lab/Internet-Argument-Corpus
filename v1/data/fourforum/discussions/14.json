   "Last time I checked, it was a debate about religion and evolution co-existing. Not a debate about Creationism vs. \"science\" and \"reality\".\n\n \n Well, stated that way, there is no problem with religion and evolution co-existing. Many evolutionary biologists are religious. Dr. Kenneth Miller of Brown U. is a practicing Christian and a respected evolutionary biologist. He engages in debates from time to time with creationists and ID proponents. There is little problem with the theories of evolution and most main-line religions around the world.\n \n The real debate is between a minority of United States fundamentalist christians and science in general. You have seen on this board that even though the theories of evolution are biological, several creationists have insisted that somehow there is a grand theory of evolution that includes the origin of the universe, the galaxies, the solar system, the planets, the earth, and life on earth. Typicaly, creationists claim that they don't oppose science but only evolution - and by that they mean cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, planetary physics, biochemistry, geology, most of physics (relativity, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics), genetics, molecular biology, population genetics, embryology (evo-devo), paleontology, paleoanthropology, and on and on. What is not opposed is trivial and limited that data upon which scientific theory is built, not the theories.\n \n So to answer the question can religion and evolution co-exist? Without question. Evolutionary scientists do not study matters outside the domain of science. Science is naturalistic - methodological naturalism - and cannot observe and study the supernatural. The supernatural cannot be quantified. I have yet to see an equation that represents the power of God. That is not to claim that things outside of science do not exist or are not valid and important. It is just that science is not the proper tool for the study of such matters. Questions of faith and morals fall in other domains - theology and religion, for example.\n \n Can creationism and science co-exist? Probably not. But the problem is not with science. It is with creationism. Creationism establishes its conclusions before any evidence is examined based on \"divine revelation.\" The problem arises when science, without regard to religion, uses the scientific method to arrive at conclusions that cannot be reconciled with creationist conclusions. This makes science the evil work of Satan, and it means that scientists are trying to escape responsibility to a god based on primitive mythology.",

It is simply the study of how we were created, just as evolution is the study of how we \"evolved\".\n\n \n No. Creationism was a reaction in the late 1800 to the ideas of Darwin and Lyell. The major voice of anything that could be called creationism was George Frederick Wright, a Congregationalist Evangelical minister in Vermont. Fundamentalist christianity was the first voiced by A.C. Dixon with a series of 12 booklets published between 1910 and 1915. These and other ideas were taken up by the 7th Day Adventist Church with the flood geology of George McCready Price. But while fundamentalism flourished, creationism didn't really take hold. Most fundamentalist christians were poorly educated and didn't encounter the ideas of science. Of course, the theory of evolution was not taught in our public schools at the time. There was a brief stir in 1925 with the Scopes Trial, but generally, fundamentalism and science never met. Until the launching of Sputnik when the U.S. realized that we were way behind in teaching science and math in our public schools. There followed a revision of the science curriculum that introduced such ideas as the big bang, the great age of the universe and of the earth, and biological evolution. As a result, Henry Morris adopted the ideas of Price, and essentially launched what became modern creationism.\n \n The word has come to mean a biblical literalist. Most Christians who believe in God the Creator are not creationists. They are able to see that Genesis is not scientifically or historically accurate. It is the mythology of nomadic herdsmen.\n \n Read The Creationists by Ronald L. Numbers. Numbers is a former creationist, the son of a 7th Day Adventist minister, and a professor of the History of Science and Medicine at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\n \n \nBTW, science isn't the \"evil work of Satan\". It's man's way of trying to explain something so that they don't have to believe in something that threatens the way they enjoy living. (The Bible.)\n\n \n No, it isn't.

   "Scholars theorize that the Hebrews got their creation story from the Babylonians and Sumerians since they have similiar creation stories. \n \n Calligirl,\n You refer to Eve being created out of Adam's rib. That probably never literally happened. It also contradicts Genesis 1. In this chapter they were created together. \n \"So God created man in his own image, \n in the image of God he created him; \n male and female he created them.\" (Genesis 1:27)\n \n The creation story in Genesis 1 conflicts with the creation story in Genesis 2. In Genesis 1 man is created after the animals. In Genesis 2 Adam is created before the animals (Genesis 2:18-20). In Genesis 2 Eve is created after the animals (from Adam's rib).

   "Consider that if Eve were created out of Adam, literally, that Eve would be a clone. Eve would have had 1 X chromosome and 1 Y chromosome, just like Adam. Now I know that Calli doesn't understand that, but it is the difference in the X and Y chromosomes that determine gender - females have 2 X chromosomes and males have 1 X and 1 Y.\n \n So now I guess it becomes Adam and Steve.\n \n But no. Creationists claim that their god took the rib and miraculously changed 1 X chromosome in every cell to a Y chromosome. The question now becomes, why was the rib even necessary if there was going to be some sort of miracle anyway?\n \n So now there is yet another problem. Except for that pesky Y chromosome, Adam and Eve would have been genetically identical. That means that any given gene could have only 2 alleles (variants). Genetic analysis of the human genome has shown that on average, every gene has about 14 alleles, and these would have to have arisen in only 6,000 years. That's evolution at rates that no evolutionary biologist would dare propose.\n \n But wait! There's more! There are more than 3000 genetic diseases that have been identified down to the specific locus of a specific chromosome (I have seen various numbers reported between 3000 and 6000 - and more are being identified every year) in the human genome. How could they have all developed in such a short time - they are, after all, caused by genetic mutations (they are alleles of normal genes).\n \n So in answer to the question, \"So you don't believe that God took a rib from Adam's side to create woman?\" the answer is, certainly not. The very idea rings of mythology. When someone tells me that they believe this, I hear the banjo theme from \"Deliverance\" in the back of my mind.

It was passed down orally over hundreds of years before anyone ever bothered to write it down. Therefore, it's about 1/100th as important to me and my faith as the Gospels, which were written down by eye-witnesses at the spoken time. So yes, I believe that God created the world, but I believe his tool was evolution.\n \n I guess my question is, which account are you speaking of? You can't say \"Genesis\" because the book, the combination of Genesis, is man-made, 2 seperate and different accounts were forced together to make \"Genesis\". How do make the choice on which account you believe (the Jehovists or the Elohists)?",

   "Read the preceding verse. \"18 The LORD God said, 'It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him. 19 Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. 20 So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field. But for Adam no suitable helper was found.\" (Genesis 2:18-20)\n\n \n Okay, here is how it went: God made the animals. He said,\"Hey, Adam needs a helper.\" He brought the animals to Adam to name. He couldn't find a helper for Adam. He then took a rib out of Adam's side to create Eve. This was done on the sixth day. God created them both on the sixth day, Adam first, then Eve out of Adam's side after he had Adam name the animals.\n \n \nThey were both created on the sixth day according to Genesis 1.\n\n \n True, God created Adam, then he created Eve out of one of Adam's ribs. All in one day.\n \n \nAnyway, again, I ask you which account of Eve. There are 2. One makes no mention of a rib. I believe that Genesis is important, but I think that it must be read and understood on a little bit more of an abstract an general manner than say, Mark.\n\n \n Genesis 1:27 is a summary of Genesis 2:21-23\n \n \nYou can't bear to hear this, but Genesis is not infallible. It's a fact that it was written by 2 different groups of people and combined in Egypt in 90 AD. The book was not written as you read it today. It was passed down orally over hundreds of years before anyone ever bothered to write it down. Therefore, it's about 1/100th as important to me and my faith as the Gospels, which were written down by eye-witnesses at the spoken time. So yes, I believe that God created the world, but I believe his tool was evolution.\n\n \n So you don't believe the entire Bible? Then you fit perfectly into the category of those who \"do not want to believe the entire Bible\".\n \n \nI guess my question is, which account are you speaking of? You can't say \"Genesis\" because the book, the combination of Genesis, is man-made, 2 seperate and different accounts were forced together to make \"Genesis\".

   "That interpretation is fine except that God says, \"I WILL make a helper suitable for him.\" He hadn't made the animals yet in verse 18, but he created Adam in verse 7.\n\n \n He had ALREADY MADE the animals. \"now the Lord God HAD FORMED...\" not \"now the Lord God formed...\" See the difference? He already HAD FORMED the animals before he brought them to Adam. He made the animals before Adam. \n \n \nAs a Christian comfortable with their faith and reality.\n\n \n The Bible contradicts \"reality\". So does heaven and hell. Once you start doubting parts of the Bible, the rest falls apart. Can you PROVE that their is a heaven or a hell? Can you PROVE that there are miracles? No! When you don't believe in part of the Bible, you might as well not believe in all of it.\n \n \nI know \"how it went\", and no the two accounts are extremely different.

No contradictions there.\n \n \nI'm wondering what it implies that God brought each of the animals to Adam and none of them proved to be a suitable \"helper.\" What exactly does that mean, given the activities that seem to have been carried on between Adam and his proper \"helper\", Eve?\n\n \n What?!",

   "\" Tremble before him, all the earth! The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved.\" (1st Chronicles 16:30) Do you actually believe that the Earth doesn't move?\n\n \n You are probably using the NIV version of the Bible. It is not the most accurate version because some of the meaning was lost in the translation. Here is the NASB version (much closer to the original meaning): 1 Chronicles 16:30 \"Tremble before Him, all the earth; Indeed, the world is firmly established, it will not be moved.\" \"will\"= future tense. The earth itself is moving (rotating, orbiting the sun, etc.), but it \"will not be moved\" by something else. \n \n \n\"On the day the LORD gave the Amorites over to Israel, Joshua said to the LORD in the presence of Israel: 'O sun, stand still over Gibeon, O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon.' So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the nation avenged itself on its enemies, as it is written in the Book of Jashar. The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day.\" (Joshua 10:12-13) Joshua commanded the sun to stop moving around the Earth. Do you believe this?\n\n \n Yes I do.\n \n \n\"And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.\" (Mathew 5:30) Do you actually believe that Jesus wants us to cut off our right hand if it causes us to sin?\n\n \n He was using it as an example. He was saying that if something in your life causes you to sin, get rid of it!\n \n BTW, thanx for giving me the references to your verses! It is really annoying to have to search through the Bible to find verses that people quote without references.:)",
