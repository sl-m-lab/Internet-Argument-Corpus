This came from a leak in the Justice Department to the Washington Post. \n \n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/01/AR2005120101927.html\n \n Should the Justice department be empowered to modify legislation, as in my opinion is evident in the link report, with something as important as the 1965 Voting Act Rights? Or any enacted legislation? Will SCOTUS hear it without a full team? The two-year gag rule blew me away.",
