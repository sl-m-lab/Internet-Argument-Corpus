   "It's like an old, icky refrain. Bush is sending 20,000 people off to the slaughter and failing to equip them, just like always:\n \n http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nationworld/iraq/bal-te.armor10jan10,0,2049191.story?coll=bal-nationworld-headlines\n \n Better armor lacking for new troops in Iraq\n By David Wood\n Sun reporter\n Originally published January 10, 2007\n WASHINGTON // The thousands of troops that President Bush is expected to order to Iraq will join the fight largely without the protection of the latest armored vehicles that withstand bomb blasts far better than the Humvees in wide use, military officers said.\n \n Vehicles such as the Cougar and the M1117 Armored Security Vehicle have proven ability to save lives, but production started late and relatively small numbers are in use in Iraq, mostly because of money shortages, industry officials said.\n \n More than 1,000 American troops have been killed by roadside bombs since the war began in March 2003. At present there are fewer than 1,000 of the new armored trucks in Iraq. At $500,000 to $700,000 each, they cost more than twice as much as a standard Humvee, but already they are proving their worth.\n \n \"They are expensive, but they are going to save lives,\" said Gen. James T. Conway, commandant of the Marine Corps, during a recent trip to Iraq, where he reviewed the service's effort to get more of the vehicles.\n \n Most American troops patrol in the 20,000 Humvees the Pentagon has sent to Iraq. Most of those vehicles have been layered with added armor plating as the Pentagon has struggled over the past three years to counter the increasingly powerful and sophisticated roadside bombs, or improvised explosive devices, planted by insurgents.\n \n Two recent incidents illustrate the problem with the M1114 Humvee: The weight of added armor can make it unwieldy. And even with the extra armor, its flat bottom absorbs the full impact from bombs buried in the road, often buckling or breaking the chassis in half.\n \n On Dec. 30, Army Sgt. John Michael Sullivan, 22, of Hixon, Tenn., was killed when his Humvee was struck by an IED in the Sadr City neighborhood of Baghdad. Four days earlier, Army Spc. Joseph A. Strong, 21, of Lebanon, Ind., and Spc. Douglas L. Tinsley, 21, of Chester, S.C., died when their Humvee rolled into a canal during a patrol in Baghdad.\n \n \"The problem with the M1114s is, they are overloaded and flat-bottomed,\" said Maj. Gen. Richard C. Zilmer, the senior Marine commander in Iraq.\n \n Today, the Marines are moving quickly to buy and deploy combat vehicles with a key design improvement over the Humvee: They are built with a V-shaped hull that deflects a blast up and outward, leaving passengers shaken, but alive.\n \n Under a $125 million contract, the Marines are buying 100 Cougar and 44 Buffalo armored trucks, known collectively as MRAP, for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, made by Force Protection Inc., a small company in Ladson, S.C. The firm is producing 40 vehicles a month, said its vice president, Mike Aldrich, a retired Army officer educated at West Point.\n \n Aldrich said the design grew out of a joint Army and Marine Corps request \"designed to literally stop the bleeding from up-armored Humvees in some of the most dangerous areas in Iraq and Afghanistan.\"\n \n The military services said last month that they need 4,060 of the MRAP vehicles, with 2,500 for the Army, 538 for the Navy and 1,022 for the Marines. The delivery schedule is uncertain. Meanwhile, a permanent replacement for the Humvee, incorporating the latest design and armor improvements, is years away, Pentagon officials said, and mired in technical and cost disputes.\n \n Separately, the Army is buying the 15-ton M1117 armored vehicle for its military police. The V-hull vehicles were in production in the late 1990s but were canceled by the Army as unnecessary. In June 2004, the service decided that it needed them after all. The Army has said it needs 2,600.\n \n Today, Textron Inc. is producing 48 per month at its New Orleans plant under a contract for 1,250 vehicles.\n \n \"That's all they had the money for,\" said Clay Moise, vice president for business development for Textron's Marine and Land division.\n \n But a lack of money only partly explains why, four years into the war, there is a shortage of vehicles that can effectively survive an IED.\n \n \"The key reason it is taking so long is pretty simple: At each step along the way for the past four years, the key policymakers have assumed we were just months away from beginning to withdraw\" from Iraq, said Loren B. Thompson, a national security analyst at the Lexington Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Arlington, Va. \"As a result, they never made long-term plans for occupying the country effectively.\"\n \n Aldrich said the explanation is more complex.\n \n \"This is a radically different vehicle, and it took time, even under the pressure of war, for this country to tool up and meet the demand,\" he said. \"Our contribution to the delay was not being able to press a button and instantly start producing 20 a week. And the warfighter had to adjust and realize this wasn't a temporary problem - that we are more likely to face this type of attack than any other for decades to come.\"\n \n The Humvee, of course, has its admirers. In its newer versions, such as the M1114, added armor is matched with a more powerful, turbocharged diesel engine and other improvements.\n \n \"I love it. It's not at all hard to drive,\" said Army Spec. Jessica Dersch, 22, of Erie, Pa. \"I've been through three explosions in 10 months,\" she said in a recent interview outside Camp Blue Diamond in Ramadi.\n \n But the IED threat to Humvees is reflected in the Marines' hard-won experience in Anbar province.\n \n \"If you are hit by an IED, your chance of survival is four or five times greater in an MRAP than in a M1114,\" said a Marine commander, referring to the standard Humvee.\n \n About half of the Marines' combat vehicles in Anbar are Humvees, and these are associated with 60 percent of the combat deaths and 65 percent of the wounded Marines, officers said. By comparison, attacks on V-hull armored vehicles have resulted in 2.1 percent of Marine combat deaths and 3.5 percent of the service's wounded.\n \n A report released yesterday by the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said the IED problem came about in large measure because there were not enough U.S. troops in Iraq after the 2003 invasion to secure Saddam Hussein's ammunition caches.\n \n In the weeks after the invasion, vast amounts of anti-personnel and anti-tank mines, artillery shells and other explosives were stolen from unguarded Iraqi arsenals.\n \n \"IEDs made from looted explosives have caused about half of all U.S. combat fatalities and casualties in Iraq and have killed hundreds of Iraqis,\" the GAO said.",

   "Mutz, welcome to the forum. Your response here was the only one that was worth reading. The other two were adolescent jeering...I can only assume coming from a couple of folks who could not come up with a sensible rebuttal.\n \n In the real world, the decision to send men without new vehicles is a cost benifit kind of thing. US infantrymen are relatively cheap to replace. In order to roll out enough new vehicles in the alloted timeline in order to have all our troops wrapped in them would almost without quesiton siginifcantly increased hte per unit price of those vehicles to an unreasonable level. \n \n simone, it woudl be nice if each of our sodiers could have their own personal abrams tank to roll around in to ensure that nobody gtes hurt, but that is unrealistic. In war, soldiers die. That is their job. It is what they sign up for and what we pay them for. We cannot afford this war as is. We certainly could not afford it if we provided a level of armor for all our troops that ensures that none of them are ever injured.",

This was why our hummers did not have armor. Believe it or not, they did not just start thinking about armoring hummers at the beginning of the Iraq war. It was something that was studied and dismissed. You are not really supposed to fight from a hummer. If your hummer comes under fire, you run away and call for an air strike or a tank or something you ARE supposed to fight from. It ws judged that putting armor on hummers made them slower and less capable of carying out their primary firefight function, which is to run away.",

   "What those with boots on the ground want, they should have.\n\n \n Most of those with boots on the ground are enlisted men. Enlisted men are known for a lot of thing, but knowledge and intelligence are not on that list. They do stupid things all the time, and usually do not realize just how stupid it was until seconds before they die horribly and painfully. This is why we have a chain of command to make important decisions. To many enlisted men, armored hummers sound likea good idea, until that brieff second where they realize that their armor is not thick enough to protect them from the RPG flying towards them, and that the vehicle will not move quickly enough to get out if its flight path, because it is armored. So, they die. \n \n Enlisted men should not \"want\" anything, because they should not be wasting time thinking. That is what officers are for.\n \n \nThey should not have to rumage through trash heaps to armor their vehicles.\n\n \n You are right. They should not be digging through refuse piles to armor their vehicles. They should not be making any unauthorized changes to vehicles and those who DID dig through piles to find plates to armour their vehicles were mostly court martialed, and rightly so.\n \n Military vehicles are designed with very specific power, weight, range, and speed parameters. If you alter those, your planners cannot plan as effectively. A military convoy is only as fast as its slowest vehicle. If your convoy comes under attack, and some jerkwad has bolted 2000 lbs of steel plate to his vehicle so the convoy cannot escape as quickly, that jerkwad has put the lives of EVERY PERSON in that convoy in increased danger with his stupidity. \n \n Giving those on the ground whatever they want may sound like a great idea, but it is a logistical nightmare and is likely to get a lot of people killed becasue your average infantry soldier has no idea what he wants or needs. As obvious Child points out, on a battlefield, speed is life. If you get caught in the open and cannot beat a hasty retreat, you are dead. The ONLY vehicle in our entire military that is designed to just sit and take fire is the Abrams tank, and evn it will only take small to medium rounds. Everything else is designed to give you light protection while you run for cover, and the faster you can run, the better.\n \n In some specialized units, where you find a slightly higher caliber of soldier than you see in regular infantry units. Oneof the guys I served with was in Iraq and loaned his P226 to a marine who was going out. That marine very nearly got court martialed for carrying that weapon. At first glance that would seem to be unreasonable. After all, he borrowed the Sig because it is without question a better weapon than the baretta he was issued. \n \n If he runs out of ammo, though, he cannot get a clip from somebody else in his unit\n If it breaks, there is no way it is going to be fixed\n If he dies and somebody else is forced to pick it up, they are not going to be familiar with it.\n \n Often the rules and decisions that may seem stupid are made by people with one hell of a lot of military and combat experience, and there are good and valid reasons for making them. Bush did not send people off to fight wihtout the necessary equipment. Those guys all had the equipment that their superiors felt would best serve them, and armored hummers were not on that list...nor should they be. Then some enlisted XXXXXX who did not relalize that the hummers they were driving were specifically designed to certain munitions, as opposed to absorbing the hit, and they started whining about armor, and a bunch of well meaning civilains who have never seen a battlefield took up the cry.\n \n Simone, you have been on about armoured hummers since day one. Did you know that the unarmoured hummers were specifically designed to accelerate quickly enough to move out of the way of an RPG that was fired at its side from 30 yards away? Did you know that it was also specifically designed to be able to be out of range of that RPG before the enemy has time to reload the weapon and fire again? Do you realize that by adding armor to the hummer, they loose BOTH of those capabilities and still cannot survive a hit from an RPG?\n \n Did you know that over 80% of the Amercican troops that died during firefights in Vietnam died with empty weapons in thier hands? They ran out of ammo then the enemy just shot them like fish in a barrel. Did you realize that by adding body armor to a soldier, you decrease by 20% the amount of ammo he can carry? \n \n There are trade offs. I will be the first to say that those would be extremely difficult decisions to make because for some situations, you are going to be wrong. In a decision between speed and survivability, if you pick speed, there will be times that men will die due to that decision. If you pick survivability, there will be times that men die from lack of speed. These decisions are not made lightly, and typically they are made by entire groups of men with years of combat experience and command experience who understand the realities of a battlefield. The equipment is tested by some of the best and most experienced soldiers we have. \n \n I am no fan of Bush, but lets stick to blaming him for things he actually did wrong.",

   "Most of those with boots on the ground are enlisted men. Enlisted men are known for a lot of thing, but knowledge and intelligence are not on that list. They do stupid things all the time, and usually do not realize just how stupid it was until seconds before they die horribly and painfully. This is why we have a chain of command to make important decisions. To many enlisted men, armored hummers sound likea good idea, until that brieff second where they realize that their armor is not thick enough to protect them from the RPG flying towards them, and that the vehicle will not move quickly enough to get out if its flight path, because it is armored. So, they die. \n \n Enlisted men should not \"want\" anything, because they should not be wasting time thinking. That is what officers are for. . . .\nHmmm, if I were a military commander, I think I'd want thinking boots on the ground as well as thinking officers. I would give officers precedence over enlisted boots in most instances, especially if said officers had experience and training in military operations, and I would expect the lower ranks to obey officers quickly and without question in most cases.\n \n Sometimes, however, on the ground, experienced lower ranked personnel can instantly see other, better options which will accomplish the mission.\n \n And, I do wish I knew more about efficiently equipping a boots on the ground with armor, weaponry, etc., etc., I'd like to be outfitted with it personally to see if I could at least stumble forward so encumbered for two or three steps. I'm crippled and have to use a cane to walk, but I'd like to see what is involved. If I could stumble for two or three steps, I'd assume that a fit person could walk a mile or two so fitted out, unless temps were over a hundred Farenheit during the midst of a sandstorm.",

You don't want drones, but you also do not want enlisted men making independant operational decisions. It is not dissimilar to what you find in corporate America. Often underlings do not have neough informaiton or experience to understand why a particular decision is made. That does not necessarily invalidate the decision. \n \n The whole armour issue is similar to a corporate employee advancing an idea, having that idea refused, and then going to the press becuase they thought their idea was really good and did not understand why it was not implemented. \n \n \nAnd, I do wish I knew more about efficiently equipping a boots on the ground with armor, weaponry, etc., etc., I'd like to be outfitted with it personally to see if I could at least stumble forward so encumbered for two or three steps.

If I could stumble for two or three steps, I'd assume that a fit person could walk a mile or two so fitted out, unless temps were over a hundred Farenheit during the midst of a sandstorm.\n\n \n \n Coming up with a full military loadout may be difficult, but you may be able to find somebody with a frame type backpack that would let you try it out. Load about 60 lbs in it. With the weight distributed and primarily on your hips, you should be able to walk with it (assuming your disability is not a hip problem).\n \n Your average person should be able to walk with it for a long time. Either putting the bulk of the weight in your hips or even distributed about your body, it lessens fatigue and makes it easier to handle the load. Walking several miles hsould not be an issue for somebody in reasonably good shape.\n \n It is not the walking around part that is difficult. It is when the SHTF and you have to RUN. If it was just a matter of walking around, it would not be an issue. It is when your leisurely stroll down a supposedly secure area turns into a 100 meter dash that the extra weight makes a difference. In that situation, the difference between carrying 60 lbs and carrying 68 lbs is noticable, pronounced, and enough to get you killed...especially when you are carrying a rifle as well which hinders natural arm movement when you are trying for your \"sprinting for cover\" merit badge. \n \n Now I DO think that body armour for our truck drivers is a good idea. I also think that they should be issued SAWs instead of the M-16. Weight is obviously not a concern there, and their truck IS cover, so they should not generally have to do a lot of sprinting for cover. I also think that ceramic body armor is a good idea for men manning checkpoints and guardposts. I also think that they should have a SAW at every post if not a .50. These are positions where cover should always be readily available and weight is not an issue (or should not be). I also think that our convoys should have specialized convoy protection vehicles with an XM-214 microgun mounted on the roof (5.56 mm, 6 barrel, 10,000 rounds per minute) augmented by grenade launchers and a flame thrower. The military has several similar vehicles (though the flame thrower is my own addition to the idea) and while they are not very good to fight from, bu they are hell on wheels as far as a transit vehicles goes. 3 or 4 of them scattered in our convoys would increase the survivability of those convoys significantly. Nothing says \"keep your head down and don't screw with this convoy\" like 10,000 rounds per minute flying at you.",

   "What about troop movement?\n \n There have been five helicopters shot down in the last two weeks. Some rumors have it that this has been done by Sunnis with financing from some wealthy Saudi Arabians.\n \n On ground movement, how do you shift troops around without losing them?\n\n \n If you want to shift troops around a combat zone without loosing any, you keep them at home and declare their base a combat zone. Short of that, it simply cannot be done. You can try to minimize losses, but there are always going to be some. The losses we have seen are well within acceptable levels. \n \n On the helicopters, I seriosly doubt the Bush administrations claim that the losses are due to new, more advanced weaponry. If you read the reports of the crashes, the enemy hit them from close range (inside 1 km). This indicates that they have finally figured out how to effectively use the SA-7 missiles they already had rather than that they have acquired new technology. The SA-7 has always been capable of taking down our helicopters. Previously the Insurgents were trying to use them at or near maximum range (around 3 KM). The chopper would pop flares, the missile would intercept a flare and explode, then the chopper would circle around and kill the guy who fired on it. \n \n Inside 1.5 KM, the sa-7 accelerates and travels fast enough that there is no time for the deployment of countermeasures...even by automated systems (it takes longer than the flight time of the missile for countermeasures to identify the threat and kick in). \n \n The downing of the Apache confirms this suspicion. An apache is like a flying battleship. It has countermeasures out the ying yang and the most advanced threat detection system that we have. The only way you are going to shoot one down with a shoulder fired missile is if you use a fast heatseaker and it can get in there before the countermeasures activate. \n \n Also, in the downing of the Apache, I came across an article that had an interview with a witness of that crash. The witness claimed that they clearly saw a silver missile leaving a white trail of smoke behind it fire towards the apache and fly baout 500 meters before falling from the sky. The apache circled back to try to find the attacker and when they got close to the site, another missile came from behind it and blew it out of the sky. \n \n I will bet you just about any amount of money that this is a new trick that AQ has taught the insurgents. It is something we taught them in Afghanistan. The first missile was a toy. One of those \"estes\" missiles you can buy at any toy store. You wrap it in aluminum foil so the sensors on the helicopter can \"see\" it when you launch it. That is consistent with the \"silver\" missile the witness saw and the white smoke trail it left.\n \n So, you set this toy rocket up on its launcher, then use a remote to close the launch circuit from 500 or more meters away. You wait for a likely looking helicopter to pass (it takes balls to choose and Apache) and activate that toy rocket. It takes off, streaks into the sky, and the threat system on the choopper sees it and identifies it as a missile. Then the ejection charge blows off the nose cone and the toy falls to the ground before the pilot gets the chance to turn around and see it. The pilot circles around to deal with the threat, and when he goes looking for you, you have him in a perfect position to send a real missile up his exhaust port. \n \n Simple, cheap, effective, and 100% made in the USA. It kind of makes you wonder if it was really a good idea to teach the islamic militants to take down advanced aircraft.",
