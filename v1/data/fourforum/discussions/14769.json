I'll take the First stab at ending this drivel by saying neither of us was right or wrong, we just happen to disagree. My claim that you defended ID has no merit, and is withdrawn. I would prefer to get back on topic , the ball is in your court.\n\n \n You claim there are several accounts but but have not shown them.\n \n The reality of zeus or any other god was nothing to do with it,no more than arguing the role of the gods in the iliad would have any relevence to their reality.\n You may be a disabled vet..there again you may be a housewife in Canada..I dont know and dont care..\n \n I agree that these exchanges of insults have no purpose or merit but you do yourself no favours by claiming that the ' game of childish xxxxtossing back and forth 'was mine You seemed to readily toss your own childish xxxx.\n The fact remains that you did not and as yet have not proved your assertions , instead you reverted to insults and obtuseness.\n I will not agree that we just happened to disagree..you could not show evidence of your claims when I showed evidence of mine.\n However I will agree that it should end here and give Ill you the last word on it",

But the point I was making when I originally posted this was that Other Gods existed before the Biblical God was created. I used Zeus as an Example because he was the first Deity to come to mind. I didn't make up the accounts , and I realize they are Myth, but the Accounts are there all the same. \n \n Using theology to claim a \"Creator\" must have created everything is weak.. If A deity created Something whether it be man or the world he is still a Creator. It doesn't mean I believe it.",

   "Why dont you post one up on your own and count that then.\n Then get a friend to do the same and that will be another two accounts by XXXXXX commenting on something that they are ignorant of.\n You put a link to a little pissant website that you stumbled across and believed agreed with you.It didnt even know what it believed lol.\n Then I posted something from one of the best sources of information that you can find and you STILL wont admit you are wrong.What a tool!\n I believe that you would argue the same thing with a scholar on Greek mythology....no no your wrong proffessor I saw different on' Paradetect' a site made by imbeciles for imbeciles.You stupid old fart lol!\n Then we get the little rant...doesnt matter anyway cos its all fairy tales...your the fairy lol What a jerk, you actually made me laugh at youemoticon_xchicken\n\n \n \n Glad I could give you a laugh, it doesn't change the fact that you're stupid though. So you read an encyclopedia which only had one version of the creation of man in Greek mythology and suddenly I'm supposed to just ignore all the other accounts of Greek Mythology and no explore others.. You truly are as ignorant as you seem. emoticon_xbyeemoticon_xbye",

You're being a tool and you know it. I've supported my claim, You were wrong, it's time to move on to something else because honestly I'm starting to see the stupidity in both of us going back and forth over such a mundane issue as A Mythical Creator God...
