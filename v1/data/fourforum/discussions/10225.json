For some reason, Murphy could no longer represent a political party due to a \"gut-wrenching dilemma\" that forced him to step down from his new office.\n \n In fact, as bloggers soon made public, Murphy had been accused of what is called in Indiana \"criminal deviate conduct,\" a class B felony, after attempting to have sex with a sleeping man July 29.\n \n According to a police report from Clark County, Ind., the man, his sister, and Murphy had been drinking at a Young Republican party the previous night. The revelers wound up at the sister's home, where Murphy got into a top bunk bed and the victim took the bottom bunk.\n \n Sometime that morning the victim awoke to find Murphy, in his words, \"holding my dick with one hand and sucking my dick with his mouth,\" police records state. The man kicked Murphy off and left the house.\n \n Later that day, Murphy called the man to explain that he had found himself lying on the floor beside the man's bunk. The man, Murphy said, had fondled Murphy's hair in his sleep, so Murphy took this gesture as a green light for further intimacy. Unconvinced by this alibi and unmoved by Murphy's pleadings, the man filed a complaint.\n \n This was apparently not the first time Murphy had been unable to control his attraction to unconscious men. Another Clark County police report described an incident in 1998 in which Murphy crawled under the covers with a sleeping acquaintance \"and was committing the act of oral sex when [the victim] awoke.\" The victim's girlfriend, who was in the same room at the time, heard her friend yell and observed Murphy extracting himself from the bedclothes and leaving the room.\n \n Evidently, the 1998 incident stayed under wraps, since Murphy went on to become the county leader of the Young Republicans later that year. According to the local press, he served two terms as head of the Indiana Young Republicans and has been the Clark County GOP chairman since 2001.\n \n The national group, an organization of Republicans ages 18 to 40, was founded in 1931.\n \n After his election last month Murphy said he hoped to double the organization's membership by November 2008.\n \n \"I will essentially be the mouthpiece and effective leader for tens of thousands of Young Republicans 18 to 40 across the country,\" he said.\n \n All references to Murphy have now been erased from the Young Republican Web site.

For some gays, there are still more important issues out there, and in some cases those issues are best served by that party.

For many of us, sexuality takes a back seat to other issues, no matter what our orientation. Life really doesn't have to revolve around it. That's why being homosexual and being republican are not automatically incompatible.\n\n \n Well, I think in theory, \"being homosexual and being republican are not automatically incompatible\", is true. I also don't think that \"we\" as homosexuals go around wearing it on our sleeves 24/7. Being that this is a gay rights forum, we're wearing it on our sleeves more than usual.\n \n But, far from the \"I'm a democrat\" and \"I'm a republican\" thing, the right wing has been hijacked by fundamentalist principles which are appearing more and more hypocritical ever year. Most homosexuals have a knee-jerk reaction to this fundamentalist, and in my opinion, disenlightened and small view of the world. But unfortunately, this is what we see as the face of the right wing. \n \n Religion was not meant to be mixed with politics. In my opinion, the fundamentalist face (meaning the ilk of the Family Research Council and Focus on the Family) are nothing more than the KKK in suits, ties and deep purse strings. So, I think it's understandable to have gays living for the \"cause\" and becoming obsessively critical of the Republicans. Quite honestly, if the Republicans disassociated themselves completely from the Religious Right, they'd have a better chance at winning over more independents and conservative Dems. But they're too scared to do it. Let the Religous Right form their own party and push their own agenda. They'd end up being the severe minority, in my opinion. The Religious Right is nothing more than an incredibly powerful lobbyist group. They've taken the party of Lincoln and turned it on it upside down.\n \n Freedom of religion does not mean religious freedom to repress a minority. I'm well aware of the good deeds that churches do for the community, and to me, being of service is what being a true spiritual being is all about. Is what my fathers taught me when I was a teenager. Most people on this board have fulfilling lives outside of their sexuality. And some people on this board are gay AND Christian. For me, my sexuality does take a back seat to everything else in my life. But I'm fortunate to be recognized as a full human being in the country where I live. \n \n If homosexuals have equal rights and full acceptance in society, then republican, democrat, independant, greene, libertarian labels won't matter as much. Choices of voting and can be made for political beliefs, not religious ones. But the more hypocracy surfaces in the Republican party, expect homosexuals to point out the hypocracy with more and more ferver.",

And an excerpt below.\n \n http://www.traditionalvalues.org/urban/one.php\n New York Post Exposes High Rate Of Teacher/Student Molestations\n \n In a story not widely publicized in the mainstream press, the New York Post published a story in its July 30, 2001 edition about the secret epidemic of homosexual child abuse cases that go unreported in New York City's public schools.\n \n The report, \"Secret Shame Of Our Schools: Sexual Abuse Of Students Runs Rampant,\" by Douglas Montero, is the result of an analysis of 117 cases of sexual abuse between January 1999 and June 2001. Sixty percent of those accused of sexual abuse were transferred to desk jobs inside the school district. Forty percent of those transferred suspects were repeat sex offenders.\n \n The report noted that out of the 117 cases, 212 children were victims. In 45% of the cases, the sex offender attacked more than one student. In nearly 16% of the cases, school officials delayed or tried to cover up the sexual molestations. The average victim is a 15-year-old girl and 75% of the victims were girls. According to the report, \"Nearly 20 percent of the offenders are homosexuals and in most of these cases, the attack led to a sexual relationship with the stu- dent.\" The report also discovered that the Board of Education investigated another 347 substantiated sex abuse cases between January 2000 and July 20, 2001. Adding the 117 cases with the 327, it appears that at least one child is sexually abused each day by a school employee-and 20% of these molestations against children are done by homosexuals!\n Considering that according to these most current sources that only approximately 1.2-2% of the population is gay then the actual occurrences per capita are huge when compared to the other 98-99% of the hetero population. But even if the gay population was approximately 7% of the hetero as has been previously alleged, the same case could be made.",

   "This is typical right-wing ignorance. They are so quick to propagate hatred and fear of gays, they don't bother to learn the facts. They assume that if the victim is a boy the male perpetrator must be gay and acting on his homosexuality. That isn't true, as this study shows---\n \n http://www.childmolestationprevention.org/pdfs/study.pdf\n \n Page 12: Adult partner preference of men who molested boys showed only 8% of the men were exclusively homosexual, 51% of the men who molested boys were exclusively heterosexual, 19% predominantly heterosexual, 9% were equally homosexual and heterosexual.\n \n It's as simple as looking up the terms heterosexual and homosexual in the dictionary, nowhere will you find the definition of a sexual attraction to, or the molestation of, children.\n \n However, they hope to scare the ignorant and unwashed into associating being gay with something harmful and horrible like threatening the security of children. It's ignorant, irrational; it's bigotry.\n \n No one believes you are not merely propagating your own hatred of gays when you post garbage like this, Archangel.\n\n \n But Jake, even using your statistics is damming for the gay community on a per-capita basis as according to some statistics, the percentage of gays in our population is around 1.2 to 2%. So if only 8% of the molesters were exclusively gay then the per-capita percentage is much higher than it is for the other 98-99% of the population. I would also point out that if you combine the numbers from your article for the exclusively gay and the 9% were equally homosexual and heterosexual which I question, then you come up with approximately the same percentages of the other article. \n \n Attempting to further itemize and departmentalize statistics is a typical way of fudging the numbers to create a preferred outcome so it tends to blur results rather than clarify them. And here's another perspective: \n \n http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu7TogsBGxBQArn9XNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTExbTV0dDR1BHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDMQRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkAwRsA1dTMQ--/SIG=13hioi7s7/EXP=1187107944/**http%3a//www.jesus-is-savior.com/Evils%2520in%2520America/Sodomy/pedophilia_and_homosexuals.htm\n \n Homosexuality 'youth-oriented'?\n \n \"Research on the homosexual lifestyle confirms it is almost exclusively a youth-oriented culture,\" Baldwin wrote. \"Very few gays exhibit preference for older men.\"\n \n \"Some admit to focus on teenage boys,\" he said, \"some on prepubescent boys, and many cross over between categories.\"\n \n A 1988 study detailed in Baldwin's report found that most pedophiles even consider themselves to be \"gay.\" According to the study, \"Archives of Sexual Behavior,\" some 86 percent of pedophiles described themselves as homosexual or bisexual. Also, the study found, the number of teenage male prostitutes who identify as homosexuals has risen from 10 percent to 60 percent in the past 15 years.\n \n When asked what he thought about critics who attempt to debunk his research, Baldwin said the results speak for themselves.\n \n \"For them to say this theory is false is to call many of the homosexual movement's leaders liars,\" he said. \"Most of my evidence comes right from the gay community.\"\n \n \"I managed to find enough evidence that my thesis - child molestation is an integral part of the homosexual movement - is a valid thesis,\" Baldwin told WorldNetDaily.\n \n Other experts have also found a distinct pattern between child sex abusers and the incidence of homosexuality.\n \n \"How long can psychologists be in denial about the significance of the dark side, and ignore what it implies about the homosexual condition? And there's a matter of even greater concern. How long will psychologists eagerly throw open the door to gay life for every sexually confused teenager?\" writes Joseph Nicolosi, Ph.D, on behalf of NARTH - the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality - a group that says it exists to \"provide psychological understanding of the cause, treatment and behavior patterns associated with homosexuality, within the boundaries of a civil public dialogue.\"\n \n The North American Man-Boy Love Association, or NAMBLA, is \"a group that openly promotes sex with minor boys and claims that boy-lovers respond to the needs of the boys they love,\" Baldwin said in his report.\n \n The group is often endorsed by \"many of the homosexual movement's most prominent leaders,\" he said.\n \n \n \n Advocacy moving to schools\n \n Promotion of the \"gay and lesbian lifestyle\" is increasing in the nation's public schools.\n \n A WND survey of homosexual-oriented websites found that almost every group has some sort of program to \"educate\" teachers, school administrators and other school employees about the homosexual lifestyle:\n \n \n \n GLSEN - the Gay Lesbian and Straight Education Network - bills itself as \"the largest national network of parents, students, educators and others\" specifically formed to end \"discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression in K-12 schools. Two recent press released boasted of the Broward County (Fla.) school board approving GLSEN-sponsored \"training for teachers.\"\n \n \n A student activist working with GLSEN officials has managed to \"give voice\" recently to \"gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered students\" at California schools;\n \n \n PFLAG has created a national campaign called, \"From Our House to the Schoolhouse,\" distributing to school officials - among other materials - a booklet entitled, \"Just the Facts About Sexual Orientation and Youth: A Primer For Principals, Educators, & School Personnel. [Editor's note: Readers need the Adobe PDF reader to open and read this file.]\n Though most school-related programs are sold to administrators and parents as programs designed simply to end persecution of homosexuals and lesbians, none disclose what Baldwin says is compelling evidence that homosexuality is harmful to children.\n \n \"What ... does the academic literature say about the relationship between homosexuality and child molestation? Quite a bit, actually,\" he wrote, quoting data compiled by the Family Research Institute: \"Scientific studies confirm a strong pedophilic predisposition among homosexuals.\"\n \n The institute, after reviewing more than 19 studies and peer-reviewed reports in a 1985 \"Psychological Reports\" article, found that homosexuals account for between 25 and 40 percent of all child molestation.\n \n \"But this number is low,\" Baldwin says, \"due to the fact that many reporters will not report if a child molester is a homosexual, even if he knows that to be the case.\"",

That's about HETEROSEXUAL males isn't it.\n Not gays.\n\n \n I was making a point. Clearly you were trying to use this incident to infer something abut Republicans (when you really have no idea whether or not that anything whatsoever to do with it). If you can blithely use isolated incidents of corruption (which happen with Dems too sometimes) to try and say something about Republicans, the same twisted logic could be used over the fact he's gay. Of course, it's an invalid way to look at it, but then that's the point, isn't it? A point which clearly went right over your head.\n \n \nIt's an educated guess Jyoshu.\n Which is more than you are presenting...\n\n \n You want me to present a theory?? How about the simple possibility that he was the sort of person that tries to victimizes people in their sleep? We couldn't possibly entertain THAT idea, now could we? You're just wanting to create some dots to connect over him having an \"(R)\" by his name. \n \n \n\"supposedly gay-hostile\"?\n How many facts do we have to point to before you drop the facade?\n I just pointed out the abysmally small representation of gay politicians in the GOP.\n We can look at party platform planks too, demonstrating openly anti-gay positions.\n\n \n But you don't seem content to stop there. You seem to want to infer they are a party of rapists, given this very thread. That's more to the point here.\n \n \n\"centric\"?\n Jyoshu, if a party came along and advertised that Christians shouldn't adopt, that Christians shouldn't be able to marry, and that Christians shouldn't be able to serve in the military.\n If they were invited to a religious discussion forum and every single politician declined, presumably because they didn't want to be associated with Christians. Would YOU vote for them?\n\n \n It depends on the other issues too. Or maybe I'd be dissatisfied with BOTH parties. Most people aren't a one-issue voter, Foundit. Maybe you are. But most aren't. And look, obviously not all gays see it the way you do, because there are out-of-the-closet gays IN the Republican party. The LCR for instance. So, it's not like reality bears out what you say.\n \n \nDon't worry. I think everybody here KNOWS you won't answer that question...\n\n \n Well, you can eat you own words, because I just did.\n \n \nIt has less to do with \"centric\" and more to do with any concern whatsoever for your own equality.\n\n \n So if one party denies you equality, but the other party's policies may deny your very safety and livelihood, you'd still pick the first one? \n \n \nYou're like a white man trying to tell Martin Luther King Jr what political issues he should focus on, because you as a white man don't really care too much about your whiteness issues...\n\n \n ML King Jr.??? You give yourself WAY too much credit, Foundit. :p \n \n No, I'm like the white man who has enough sense to know that republicans don't equate to rapists. Remember, that WAS the issue here--the fact you tried to make a connection with him being part of the GOP and committing a sexual crime.

If you can blithely use isolated incidents of corruption (which happen with Dems too sometimes) to try and say something about Republicans, the same twisted logic could be used over the fact he's gay.\n\n Actually, NO.\n You cannot, as I pointed out.\n Trying to infer something regarding \"gay\" being the causative factor would quickly reach a dead-end when you realize that being STRAIGHT IS MORE of an issue for the corruption at hand than being gay is.\n \n It's like trying to argue that A causes things to catch on fire, when the truth of the matter is that being B is more associated with things catching on fire than A is.\n \n I'm not sure why that is so difficult a concept for you.\n \n I gave an educated statement, based on sound reasoning.\n Your reply was flawed for an entirely different reason.\n \n \n \nYou want me to present a theory?? How about the simple possibility that he was the sort of person that tries to victimizes people in their sleep? We couldn't possibly entertain THAT idea, now could we? You're just wanting to create some dots to connect over him having an \"(R)\" by his name.\n\n Actually, no.\n If I need to make it plain for you, it's not the \"(R)\" by his name which is the factor, but something the \"(R)\"s have in common.\n \n It's like a lot of group A having a fondness for chili. Moreso than group B.\n Being in group A doesn't cause group A to have more gas. It's the CHILI that gives them more gas.\n Likewise, it's not the REPUBLICANISM that causes such distress, but the predilection for being anti-gay that causes the internal stress in gays who want to be republican and gay.\n \n If the Republicans weren't so anti-gay, it wouldn't be a problem!\n Get it?\n \n \n \nBut you don't seem content to stop there. You seem to want to infer they are a party of rapists, given this very thread. That's more to the point here.\n\n I inferred no such thing.\n Can you quote what I said which inferred that?\n \n \n \nIt depends on the other issues too.\n\n I forgot to add on the finale.\n They agree with you on EVERY OTHER ISSUE around.\n Would you be content to see such a group in power, realizing that they could very well adopt amendments to discriminate against Christianity?\n (Obviously for this question to pose any reality, your rights and privileges would have to be completely open to discrimination, so the first amendment is moot.)\n \n \n \nMost people aren't a one-issue voter, Foundit. Maybe you are. But most aren't.\n\n I've got plenty of issues I disagree with Republicans on.\n But the point is that the difference between the Republican homophobia and the Democrat's support for gays is so vast, that it cannot be seen as just \"one-issue\" when it is just so CENTRAL to the person's life.\n \n I mean, we're talking about actions that DIRECTLY impact a person's life. Their ability to adopt, be employed without fear of sexual orientation discrimination, service in the military, and marital rights.\n \n Hardly just \"one issue\", unless you're on the other side of the stick who has never had to worry about ANY of the issues that are at hand...\n \n \n \nAnd look, obviously not all gays see it the way you do, because there are out-of-the-closet gays IN the Republican party. The LCR for instance. So, it's not like reality bears out what you say.\n\n Say whaaa?\n How does the existence of the Log Cabin Republicans refute what I said?\n And please actually QUOTE what I said that is refuted by the existence of the Log Cabin Republicans.\n It seems you just got lost and reached a conclusion that does not bear out reality...\n \n \n \nWell, you can eat you own words, because I just did.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n Actually, NO.\n You did not Jyoshu.\n You did not say whether or not you would vote for them.\n \"It depends...\" is hardly an answer, unless you're a politician attempting to avoid the answer...\n \n \n \nSo if one party denies you equality, but the other party's policies may deny your very safety and livelihood, you'd still pick the first one? \n\n No.\n Nothing I said would lead any rational thinking person to think that I would still pick the first one.\n \n Quit with the strawman arguments already...\n \n \n \nML King Jr.??? You give yourself WAY too much credit, Foundit.\n\n hahaha.\n I was in no way suggesting a comparison between myself and MLK.\n I was simply answering your question, and giving you a good example of WHY people march.\n \n \n \nNo, I'm like the white man who has enough sense to know that republicans don't equate to rapists.\n\n Well, that's another strawman argument as I wasn't claiming they equate to rapists.\n Why do you spend so much time jousting at arguments nobody actually uttered?\n \n \n \nRemember, that WAS the issue here--the fact you tried to make a connection with him being part of the GOP and committing a sexual crime.\n\n Actually, NO. I did not.\n The relationship, since I obviously have to draw a map for you, is between the extreme type of self-denial and self-induced emotion that causes a person to deny who they truly are, and lead them to act out in secret.\n \n If I were trying to make a connection between the GOP and committing sexual crimes, I would have lead with this web-site, which has a long list of examples.\n http://www.armchairsubversive.org/\n \n A little scary looking at it really...\n \n \n \nI know you'd prefer to try and defend something more easily defensible by moving to a subject that you can be the victim, but I'm not going to let you off the hook so easily.\n\n This coming from the guy who just tried to claim that I was arguing that being a part of the GOP causes sexual crime?\n I swear.

By the way just who would we be surrendering to in Iraq? The Maliki government? The shitte militias? The sunni miltias? Nope they are both anti- Al Queda and will gladly shoot the buggers. Indeed the sunni are getting US help in doing so! To Iran perhaps? How so we wanted the Iraquis to have a democracy and they can choose to be an Iranian ally if they wish - or do you want to deny them soveringty? Saddam Hussein? Nope hes dead! Osoma Bin Laden? Nope hes NOT in Iraq and he never attacked us from there. Indeed SH was his enemy! Syria? Nope Iraq will hold them back on its own - they are not allies now. Turkey - oops they are OUR allies. The former Soviet Union - oops thats off the table! Russia? What kind of fools do you think they are? There is simply nobody to surrender to! What we would like to avoid is an intense bloody (but probably short) civil war within Iraq among the various factions. But what we are getting is simply a longer version of the same thing in which US troops stand between the warring parties and slow the process. But we only slow it not stop it and as a result WE bleed slowly to death along with the Iraquis. Our troops deserve better, our nation desrves better, and the Iraquis deserve each other.",

   "Surrender at any cost\n \n Hillary Clinton is on record as saying that once she's President (never happen), she would assure that U.S. forces would promptly leave Iraq. Then she flip-flopped and said it would take more time. Other surrender artists from the far left don't have that much patience - they want out now. Like yesterday. Get a new plan, Stan. And set yourself free. APPEASE THAT EVIL! \n \n Sounds real chic. End the bloodshed, or so they believe. \n \n But would it really? We all saw what happened with the 'Killing Fields' after our exit from the Republic of Vietnam. Between one and two million individuals butchered. Terror reigned supreme. The systematic slaughter of innocents actually intensified. When anti-war activist Jane Fonda was reminded about that, her knee-jerk reply was that it was all America's fault to begin with. Sure, Jane. Blame America first. It's like Tourette's Syndrome with them. They can't help it. Out it comes, automatically. Apparently Fonda and the far left are unaware that the communists were slaughtering the South Vietnamese and others long before we ever arrived. One has to marvel at their brand of twisted logic. \n \n The United States has a significant interest in a stable and democratic Iraq. For one thing, a stable Iraq is not an open breeding ground for terrorism. With democratic Afghanistan on the other side, fundamentalist Iran finds itself sandwiched between two fledging democracies. That tends to put a damper, if only a limited one, on Iran's voracious appetite for the export of arms and terrorism. Second, it is becoming increasingly apparent in many Iraqi communities that neither the Sunnis or Shiites are particularly enamored with the blood-thirsty totalitarianism of Al Queda and Taliban fundamentalists. More and more, Iraqi citizens are either turning these extremists in to coalition forces or taking these thugs to task themselves at the muzzle point of an AK-47. The United States would have another partner in freedom. Once people have a taste of freedom, totalitarianism becomes an affront to the human spirit. \n \n But the main question for Mrs. Clinton, Harry Reid, and the other left-wing surrender artists is, what happens in Iraq and the region should the U.S. prematurely depart? If you think Iraq is a bloodbath now, just wait and see what happens next. The Killing Fields will be back with a vengeance. With Iran backing Al Sadr and other like-minded murderers, the Iraqi government would likely disintegrate within a matter of months. Anyone who ever backed coalition forces would be hunted down like the Jews under Adolph Hitler. The lucky ones who do survive would find themselves in fundamentalist \"reeducation\" camps until their views coincided with those of their supremacist slave masters. Nor would the Kurds escape. Their way of life is over too. Once that holocaust ends, and it will go on for quite some time, then you are left with pro-terrorist nations Iran, Iraq, and Syria dominating the Middle East, and very likely the Persian Gulf. Who then will be next? And there will be a \"next.\" Very likely, Saudi Arabia and, most certainly, Israel. Then any Arab or Muslim country with a non-fundamentalist government. You can count on it. The whole region would become a breeding ground for the export of terror and fundamentalism. \n \n And then the vicious circle of far-left liberal statesmanship will become complete. They will once again go back to the impotent U.N. for assistance. Calls for sanctions will once more abound. More senators and statesmen will give blustery speeches. And more long-winded rhetoric and half-baked condemnations will again be meted out, first at Bush and the U.S. for letting this happen, and then at anyone else left standing. This time, though, they'll be showing up at the U.N. on their bicycles, because Middle East oil will be at a serious premium, if available at all. And that's as far as it will all go. That's as far as it ever goes with them. Once the liberals are done at the U.N. - after all the calls for sanctions and bleeding-heart admonitions to play nice are duly pontificated; after their patented appeasement resolutions are passed, and after the bad guys still haven't budged one inch - it's over. Finis. End of story. That's all there is from the libs - there isn't any more. Not even a massive dose of Viagra can get them to stand strong now. The far left crowd doesn't have the stomach for the true cost of freedom. Had they been at Valley Forge they would have packed it in in a San Francisco heartbeat and they'd all be speaking the King's English today. Nope, all that's left is for them to go home, wring their hands, and wait for Osama and Company to eventually come calling. And they will. You can count on it.\n\n \n Typical spin.. Completely false. \n \n The Killing Fields happened in Cambodia NOT Vietnam...In Fact, it was Vietnam that ended the horror. If we would have stayed Vietnam could not have saved the lives they safed. We would have been busy still shooting them. Spin central...and Lie\n \n Clinton never said rapid withdraw...nope. Its a good idea though since Al Qeada is the enemy and they'll be crushed 30 days after we leave. The shia militias are a thousand times larger and want to kill them.\n \n Oh and Osama is doing just fine. Better than ever. Last intel. est. has them larger than before and south america is in love with Osama.\n \n Its the stupid that gets me.",

   "And here's some good commentary. I think that word \"hypocrite\" just might surface again. \n \n \n \nI have a certain sympathy for closeted gay men and lesbians. I think that being so deeply ashamed of a part of yourself that's so fundamental, and that you can do nothing to change, must be close to unbearable; and the knowledge that coming clean would involve not only admitting that you're gay, but also that you have lied for years to people you care about, and who trust you, would only make it that much worse. But my sympathy vanishes when it comes to people who support amending the Constitution to ban gay marriage, as Craig did. There are limits to what you get to do to protect your own secrets, and being willing to permanently destroy gay men and lesbians' chances to marry the people they love, and with whom they have found happiness, is way, way outside them.\n \n (For the record, I don't have much sympathy for straight people who support this idiotic and mean-spirited amendment either.)\n \n Craig seems to have made a habit of voting against laws that would secure the rights of gay men and lesbians. In addition to supporting the Constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, he voted against a bill that would have banned job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, against expanding the definition of hate crimes to include sexual orientation, and was rated zero by the Human Rights Campaign in each of the last three Congresses (1, 2, 3; all pdf.) I truly can't imagine what it would be like -- how little self-respect a person would have to have -- to amass that sort of voting record while cruising for gay sex in airport restrooms. \n \n And besides, if I had any sympathy for Larry Craig, the fact that he \"handed the plainclothes sergeant who arrested him a business card that identified him as a U.S. Senator and said, \"What do you think about that?\"\" would have destroyed it. The laws are meant to apply to everyone, Senators included. No one gets to violate laws he himself supports and then use the fact that he has been elected to high office to get himself off the hook. Being elected Senator means being given a position of trust and responsibility that you should work every day to be worthy of, not a Get Out Of Jail Free card.\n\n \n http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2007/08/larry-craig-hil.html",
