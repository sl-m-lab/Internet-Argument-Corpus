   "I think there is no secret for anybody in Europe that by all available means Washington tries to create as much as possible difficulties at the way of European development now. \n At first on US advice we admitted Poland and the Baltic States to EU membership. And now, receiving effective support of the USA, Ukraine has joined WTO... and begun to abuse its rights there! For example, arrogant Ukrainians demand to limit import of European products for fear of stepping up destructive competition for their home-made goods! \n Just think of it! They've won lowering of customs duties and now started knocking great expansion in investment spending out of WTO for own producers' supporting! Joining the ranks of other US vassals such as Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and Georgia and hoping in all-round support of its overseas friends, Kiev is under the impression that it gets what ever it wants in WTO! \n And after it we dare to nibble at US offer about Ukraine's joining NATO? Idiocy!",
