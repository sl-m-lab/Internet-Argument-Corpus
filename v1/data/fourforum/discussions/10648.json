They bear a family resemblance that fascinates people, and scientists see increasing evidence of similarities in chimp behavior and skills, making some of them think on the vagaries of evolution.\n \n For some time, paleontologists and evolutionary biologists have known that chimp ancestors were the last line of today's apes to diverge from the branch that led to humans, probably six million, maybe four million years ago. More recent examination shows that despite profound differences in the two species, just a 1.23 percent difference in their genes separates Homo sapiens from chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes.\n \n And certain similarities between the two species, scientists say, go beyond expressive faces and opposable thumbs.\n \n Chimps display a remarkable range of behavior and talent. They make and use simple tools, hunt in groups and engage in aggressive, violent acts. They are social creatures that appear to be capable of empathy, altruism, self-awareness, cooperation in problem solving and learning through example and experience. Chimps even outperform humans in some memory tasks.\n\n \n Well then. You stand corrected. Now it just remains to be seen if you'll admit you are wrong.

   "At what point would you acknowledge that the complexity is so remarkable that some sort of intelligence must be behind it?\n\n \n At no point. I understand history. Therefore I realize that simply because we do not know does not equate to Goddidit. Artur C. Clark once wrote that \"any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\" That can easily apply to the natural world. What we believe to be unexplainable only is that way because we have not advanced to the stage where we can explain it. The earliest religion, Animism attributed things like rain, sun and lightning to Gods because they were at a loss to explain the natural world. Those natural occurrences were too complex for them to understand at their developed level. ID is in principle no different. And ID is clearly hiding that their so called intelligent Designer is the Christian God. No religious group other then evangelical Christians have jumped on board in numbers and in funds. The Discovery Institute is funded by Evanglical Christians.\n \n \nRemember, the universe is not static as was thought for centuries. Something caused it to propel outward.\n\n \n Force. Which we know is not intelligent. It can be controlled by intelligent forces but it itself is not intelligent.\n \n \nThe cell is much more complex than we could have imagined only a few years ago.\n\n \n So? You're displaying the very rational as Animists. ID can be summed up in one phrase: Stuff Complex, Therefore God. If you accept ID, you must accept Animist, or you are a hypocrite. \n \n \nAll the result of random chance?\n\n \n Again, you are guilty of what you accuse others of. Cells did not come by what they are today by 'random' chance. While it is true that mutations are indeed random, the selection of genes and thereby allele frequencies is dictated by a wide variety of factors, few if any are random. \n \n \nAt what point does faith in randomness become much more obsurd than faith in an intelligent designer? \n\n \n Only when you do not understand evolution. \n \n \nAll good questions I think.\n\n \n For one who is guilty of what he accuses others of, I'm not surprised.\n \n \nSo then you will agree that evolution is useless in getting at possible answers on what really matters, how we got here?\n\n \n What do you mean how we got here? Evolution explains how life grew from primitive single celled organisms into complex multi-celled organisms. That alone explains how we got here. If you're looking for a theory of everything, that's a interdisciplinary study of various sciences, psychology and cultural studies. But mankind is very far from a single unifying theory. \n \n \nIf you concede that then I'm happy to end this discussion.\n\n \n I have no idea what you mean by \"how we got here.\"\n \n \nI recall, however, visiting the Smithsonian and seeing a detailed description of how amino acids combined to form the building blocks of life.
