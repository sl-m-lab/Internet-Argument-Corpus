Creationists don't, by any means, incorrectly use the word by your standards. They mean exactly what you mean. They do not mean, as you do not, that a belief it a predictive hypothesis that has been tested. You are using the word belief as creationists do so that you can claim that evolution is a religion.\n \nThat is insanely inaccurate, but I will do so to illustrate the point.\n\n So you don't actually have any idea of what a scientific theory is or how it is developed?

   "Then the question is, why didn't you use the definition that was more appropriate to a discussion of science, rather than religion?\n\n I did.\n \n \nThen you do, in fact, understand that the use of your definition is deceptive when it is applied to science.\n\n I do not, it is not because I have no concept of what science is.\n \n \nWhat on earth does that bit of gibberish mean? What, in the name of god, are you talking about? I don't bother to follow nonsensical posters on a daily basis, and I just don't want to devote the time to monitor your idiocy on a daily basis.\n\n I'm sorry if it is above you.\n \n \nSo what good is your link to your Little Golden Dictionary if I can't actually reference your cite without buying it?\n\n You can\n \n \nDid you actually read any of the other definitions?\n\n Yes\n \n \nHere's the definition from Thorndike-Barnhart Dictionary published by Doubleday& Company in 1976 (2330 pp.).\n\n If that is the definition of faith it is absolutely correct.\n \n If believing means 'thinking because of faith' then why did the definition have to add 'without proof?\n \n \nBecause your \"posted definition\" does not exclude faith and does not include prediction and testing.\n\n As it should not, did I not just tell you that I don't see the need to include epistemological data with acceptance data?\n \n \nAs a result, if I were to say that I believe in evolution, you can respond that evolution is \"jist a relijin,\" no better than your religion. You don't seem to grasp that science isn't a \"belief.\" Scientists don't \"believe\" by your definition.\n\n You are 10 times worse than bennedict and fartigle when it comes to this imaginary opponent stuff.\n \n Scientist do believe many theories by my definition, for instance Darwin believed in ToE by my definition.\n \n Have fun proving otherwise.\n \n \nScientists accept scientific theories as the best explanations. Sometimes, there are several scientific explanations, in which case, scientists sometimes disagree.\n\n And.........?\n \n \nSimply because your definition allowed for faith without tested evidence.\n\n So does cereal eating, what of it?\n \n What I mean by that is no statement cannot equal positive statement.\n \n \nBut you didn't. I have seen that definition posted by a number of creationists who used their Little Golden Dictionary in the same way that you did. They, like you, wanted to equate evolution with religion.\n\n So why did they choose the only definition of belief totally devoid of faith?\n \n \nBut you have intentionally misdefined the word belief when applied to science. That is dishonest.\n\n No I didn't, I use the word belief in the same sense in all cases. (well sometimes when I am not sure of something I will say I believe it is true because I think it is the most likely alternative) but that is still in the same sense and does not imply faith.\n \n \nDon't be stupid. Creationists don't, by any means, incorrectly use the word by your standards. They mean exactly what you mean. They do not mean, as you do not, that a belief it a predictive hypothesis that has been tested. You are using the word belief as creationists do so that you can claim that evolution is a religion.\n\n You saw through my evil little plot oh no.\n \n Once again I do not see the purpose in implying the epistemological source of a belief with the word.\n \n \nSo you don't actually have any idea of what a scientific theory is or how it is developed? I didn't think so.\n\n You do you think you are convincing with behavior like that?\n \n I am very sure now all of this madness you spew is entirely for your own benefit.\n \n \nDid that actually seem like the real English language when you wrote it?\n\n Did it when you told me to substitute definitions?\n \n \nYet another non-sequitur. In other words, babble.\n\n Right I must have a crazy creationist boss.",
