   "Does anyone still watch this show? I hate reality shows for the most part but I'm still hooked on Survivor as I have been since season 1 and can't wait for the next one to begin which is fortunately this Thursday!!!\n \n http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor7/\n \n Who will win this time? I think there are at least 8 people who have a shot at winning and don't see an obvious choice. After much consideration I've decided that I think the one who has the best shot is the one I was turned off to the most when I first seen the pictures. Rupert looks like he will have a shot at winning the whole thing. He isn't going to be a threat to anyone nor an anchor and I think he can handle life on Survivor.",

They're more cohesive than Morgan. I love them, but I'd like to see them loose someday just to see how crappy they'll get.\n \n The show didn't appeal to me initially, but hey a bunch of people being thrown overboard with nothing but the clothes on their backs kinda caught my eye and got me hooked ever since. \n \n So far so good I'll admit. \n \n The real appeal however is seeing how people cope in real life situations. It's amazing how situations bring out the best and worst in people. Truly amazing!\n \n GO DRAKE GO DRAKE GO !!!!!",
