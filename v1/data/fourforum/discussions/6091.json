   "The mission wasn't rushed, they thought that they had all bases covered. But apparently there's a structural design flaw in the Space Shuttle boosters which can't be fixed and which was overlooked.\n \n Your space program isn't really in shambles but rather just a bit antiquated. Clinging on to the re-usable Space Shuttle while these days one-use rockets are more reliable and cheaper doesn't really help. The only thing the shuttle has going for it is the large payload.\n My thoughts: design a new shuttle which doesn't need external boosters. In the meanwhile ditch the current shuttle, buy some one-use rockets from the Europeans or the Russians and use those for the time being. \n \n As for your last question, well, people get the leaders they deserve.;) :p",

   "\n As for your last question, well, people get the leaders they deserve.;) :p\n\n And who's running the EU? That's right, it's the French. Good luck with that ;)\n \n I don't think that two years was \"rushed.\" And I doubt that Bush had a lot to do with getting the program back out. The latest images taken during liftoff showed that there was more of a problem than previously expected. The ice (that chipped the heat shield tiles on Columbia) was always forming and was a substantial risk, it hadn't been noticed until Columbia, and finally recorded with Discovery. Until that problem gets fixed, all space programs are going to be grounded.\n \n We really do need to update our space program, using shuttles that were state of the art in 1980 just doesn't seem like a good idea to me. But first we need to get public interest back in the program, maybe a new exploration program instead of just science projects in space.\n \n And why is this thread in Politics instead of Science or Technology? I get the feeling that simone is stretching to try to get another anti-Bush thread going.",

   "Actually it was foam debris that punched a hole in Columbia.\n It was foam that flew off the tank of this last mission too.\n \n The spot where the foam came off was \"non-intrusively examined\" meaning they scanned it with X-rays or something. If they had intrusively examined it they would have had to replace it anyway. And they wouldn't know if they were replacing good stuff with bad or what.\n \n The scans they did told them it was ok. They learned that they were wrong.\n \n Ice pretty much always forms on these big liquid oxygen and hydrogen tanks.\n Look at some old Apollo footage of a Saturn V taking off and you see the ice falling off. The shuttle has insulation to minimize this, but there is still a little.\n \n Here's another example of trying to blame leaders:\n http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2005/7/28/93055.shtml\n \n \nAs recently as last month, NASA had been warned that foam insulation on the space shuttle's external fuel tank could sheer off as it did in the 2003 Columbia disaster - a problem that has plagued space shuttle flights since NASA switched to a non-Freon-based type of foam insulation to comply with Clinton administration Environmental Protection Agency regulations.\n\n \n There was a world-wide ban on CFCs and they try to make it sound as if Clinton is personally responsible for Columbia.",

Why are MAJOR consequences of environmental mandates always swept under the rug?\n\n Actually, I think the insulation problem has been a thorn in the side of NASA for a while now. It was only in the shadow of the Columbia disaster that NASA realized that this was a more serious and deadly problem than they had thought before. We could probably launch 50 more shuttles under current conditions and not have another Columbia disaster, or it could happen on the very next flight. The difference is NASA is now watching for it closely, as seen with this last launch. Just like the peices of cloth fitting pulled from between the thermal tiles. Many shuttles have returned before with peices sticking out of the bottom of the shuttle, and there was never a serious concern about it. But now NASA is focussed on inspecting the vehicle before it returns to earth, rather than after it does. A leason no doubt learned from Columbia.",

   "I think we are overlooking the point that both shuttle accidents are the indirect consequences of NASA getting the bargain basement option on the space shuttle with regard to its orbital boost stage.\n \n The Challenger disaster (frozen O-rings on the solid rocket booster) and Columbia (damage to leading edge of wing by foam shed from liquid fuel tank) are both linked to the design of the orbital boost stage- if NASA's proposal for a specific reusable boost vehicle had not been sidelined due to budget considerations the Shuttle system would have carried a much lower risk of an incident occuring at launch.\n \n So what next? well lets hope the CEV has more luck the the X-33 did..........",
