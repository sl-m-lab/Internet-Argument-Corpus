This is another example of how screwed up Washington has become. They lack common sense obviously and they say that we need this bill to stop the wasteful spending and insure everyone. Well it is going to do a load of jack to help any of those things. It is going to raise the deficit, ration healthcare, and \n I have optimism that this is not going to pass.

Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.), whose opposition forced a rewriting of the healthcare bill, Stern wrote:\n \n At the very moment that we saw real and meaningful changes within our grasp, one Senator came forward to say 'no we can't.' He can't let the Senate have an up-or-down vote on health insurance reform.\n \n And the result of this Senator saying 'we can't?' The public option is declared impossible. Americans cannot purchase Medicare at an earlier age. The health insurance reform effort we have needed for a century is at risk.\n \n Stern, whose union represents healthcare workers, did not oppose the current version of the healthcare bill, now being fought over in the Senate. He asked Obama and other leaders to continue the fight for reform.\n \n But some Democratic critics have been less charitable.\n \n Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean continued his campaign urging that the Senate bill be killed.\n \n \"If I were a senator, I would not vote for the current health care bill,\" Dean wrote in an opinion piece published in The Washington Post. \"The winners in this bill are insurance companies; the American taxpayer is about to be fleeced in a situation that dwarfs even what happened at AIG.\"\n \n Dean's comments echo what he has been saying for several days on the cable news shows. Dean is a former Democratic Party chairman and unsuccessful presidential candidate. Dean was also touted as a possible Cabinet member in the Obama administration but he was never nominated.\n \n It is unclear how much influence Dean has, but the White House was taking no chances. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs criticized Dean on Wednesday and White House political adviser David Axelrod continued this morning.\n \n Dean's complaints are \"predicated on a bunch of erroneous conclusions,\" Axelrod said. Nancy-Ann DeParle, who handles healthcare issues at the White House, talked with Dean, but \"he simply didn't want to hear that critique,\" Axelrod said on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe.\"\n \n Meanwhile, as Senate Republicans noted this morning, polls show Americans are increasingly dubious. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 47% of Americans said the plan was a bad idea while just 32% said it was a good one.\n Liberals unhappy with healthcare overhaul bill | D.C. Now | Los Angeles Times\n\n \n Not about 2/3rds either. Not that a lack of truth-seeking ever disturbed any of your handles' consciences.",

And where did I ever say 2/3rds? emoticon_confused\n\n \n Can't you ever keep track of (even) what you're talking about? You piped in on the OP's comment about 2/3rds. \n \n Here's more polling, out in today's press, completely backing up the LA Times piece on how to read those figures and showing Democrats in deep water if a public option doesn't go through; i.e. these numbers have nothing to do with support for your neo-fascists in the Republican Party, who still maintain their all-time LOW in the polls. \n \n People want a public option:\n \n \nPoll: Voters Reject Health Care Mandate Without Public Option, Medicare Buy-In\n \n A new poll suggests that voters are not pleased by the idea of health insurance mandates without a public option or a Medicare expansion.\n \n Conducted by Research 2000 for the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC) and Democracy for America (DFA), the survey finds only 33 percent of likely voters favor a health care bill that does not include a public health insurance option and does not expand Medicare, but does require all Americans to get health insurance. Slightly more Democrats -- 37 percent -- favor the idea, while only 30 percent of Republicans and 31 percent of independents do.\n \n Meanwhile, if the public option and Medicare buy-in are added, 58 percent of people support the idea. The number of Republican supporters drops to 22 percent, but independent support rises to 57 percent and Democratic support to a whopping 88 percent.\n \n \"This poll shows voters in full-blown revolt against the Senate bill,\" said PCCC co-founder Stephanie Taylor. \"Only one-third of voters support mandates without a public option, while nearly two-thirds want the public option and Medicare expansion. This will be a disaster of epic proportions for Democrats in 2010 if it's not fixed -- fast.\" more@http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/18/poll-health-care-reform-w_n_396990.html\n\n \n Note here, too, that 1/3rd of Democrats are less likely to vote in 2010 if the public option dies.\n \n \nThis is striking: A new national poll finds that fully one third of Democratic voters say that they&#8217;re &#8220;less likely&#8221; to vote in 2010 if Congress doesn&#8217;t pass a public option, underscoring the possibility that dropping the provision seriously risks dampening the Dem base&#8217;s enthusiasm.\n \n I was sent an advance look at these numbers by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and Democracy for America, which commissioned the poll from the nonpartisan Research 2000 and will release the results later this morning. The poll asks:\n \n If Congress does not pass a public option as part of health care reform, will that make you more likely or less likely to vote in the 2010 general election, or no effect?\n \n Among Dems, 33% say it would make them less likely, while less than one fourth that amount, 7%, say it would make them more likely. Sixty percent say it would have no effect.\n \n Among independent voters, 21% say it would make them less likely, and 13% say it would make them more likely, with 66% saying it would have no effect, suggesting that passing a public option would have a marginal impact among indys.\n \n Separately, in other advance excerpts of the same poll obtained by Sam Stein, 81% of Dems want Joe Lieberman punished if he filibusters health care reform.\n \n Obviously, passions over the public option are on full boil right now. Passage of a health care bill of some kind, not to say the passage of time, could reduce the impact that dropping the public option could have on Dem turnout in the 2010 elections, particularly since they&#8217;re nearly a year away.\n \n But these numbers are a reminder of just how dispirited the Dem base is by the party&#8217;s inability to leverage their comfortable majority in support of an agenda built on core liberal priorities.Poll: One Third Of Dems Less Likely To Vote In 2010 If Public Option Dies | The Plum Line\n\n \n Oh course, this is cause for your sinking ship's glee, but the present is a very transitory business, and the weight of public opinion in the United States is on my side, not yours. \n \n Quite apart from what the Democrats and Republicans are doing together in their kitchen.\n \n So dance the night away, but the Titanic is still going down.\n \n ..",

I, through the very same Constitution you speak of, have the right to point out how stupid they are. \n \n I doesn't really matter to me what people vote for...just that they actually make educated choices and understand the issues at hand.

Besides, this has more to do with Obama than anyone else. People should stop being so protective of him ITO this health bill.\n \n The fact is, his leadership has not been strong enough on the public option. They have control of Congress, they have a sitting President, and two living ex-Presidents supposedly supporting a public option, and 75% of the American people behind them.\n\n Right. Which is why Emanuel is going to be looking for a job. When the president is out of office in 3 years, Rahm goes as well.

What is your point...do you even have one?\n \n \nWell I don't know why you're saying this to me, as if I disagee ..\n\n Perhaps because you said: \n \n \nYou sound just like another Washington D.C. elitist who wants to shove through this bill because they \"know what's best\" for the little people. \n\n Clearly, this does not describe me.\n \n \n \nThey don't support this legislation, but not because you pulled that idea, too, out of the vast crystal ball that is your mind, but because reputable polling shows that people want a public option and 55+MBI at the least.\n\n I thought you said 75%, not it's 55%? Which is it?\n \n \nYou should really trying citing sources for a change to back up your arguments.\n\n A source for what? To back up my opinion that the average American voter walks into the voting booth uninformed? If you need a source to back that up, you need a healthy jolt of electrotherapy. \n \n \nJust because you're used to being a cop doesn't give you the same privileges in a forum argument.\n\n Wrong again Antonia, I am not a cop and have never said that I was. \n \n \nAnd btw, you're not the only \"little people\" on the board either, buster.\n\n Again, I prefer to think of myself as a citizen. If you want to be a \"little people\", go right ahead. I have more self respect that to place myself below the rich and famous simply because I am a member of the working middle class. As a citizen of the United States, I am every bit their equal.",
