The beginnings of the brain stem, which includes a rudimentary thalamus and spinal cord, is being formed. Most brain cells are not developed. Without a cerebral cortex (gray matter covering the brain), pain impulses cannot be received or perceived. Additionally, experts find that newborns at 26-27 weeks' gestation (24-25 weeks' fetal age) who survive have significantly less response to pain than do full term newborns. \n \n The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\n Statement on Pain of the Fetus\n \n We know of no legitimate scientific information that supports the statement that a fetus experiences pain early in pregnancy. \n \n We do know that the cerebellum attains its final configuration in the seventh month and that mylenization (or covering) of the spinal cord and the brain begins between the 20th and 40th weeks of pregnancy. These, as well as other neurological developments, would have to be in place for the fetus to receive pain.\n \n To feel pain, a fetus needs neurotransmitted hormones. In animals, these complex chemicals develop in the last third of gestation. We know of no evidence that humans are different. \n \n Claim:\n The 12-week fetus makes purposeful movements (e.g., agitated movement in an attempt to avoid suction cannula). \n \n Facts:\n At this stage of pregnancy, all fetal movement is reflexive in nature rather than purposeful, since the latter requires cognition, which is the ability to perceive and know. For cognition to occur, the cortex (gray matter covering the brain) must be present, as well as myelinization (covering sheath) of the spinal cord and attached nerves, which is not the case. \n \n An example of the reflex withdrawal without pain occurs in an anencephalic (absent brain) newborn. Another known example of the reflex movement at this stage of human pregnancy is thumb sucking in utero.\n \n What is termed \"frantic activity\" by the fetus is a reflex response of the fetus resulting from movement of the uterus and its contents induced by operator manipulation of the suction curette or the ultrasound transducer on the abdomen. This same type of response would likely occur with any external stimulus. A one-cell organism such as an amoeba will reflexively move or display a withdrawal reaction when touched.",

This happens in the celebration of The Annunciation, in the feast of the conception of the Theotokos (Mary), by Saint Anne, and the celebration of the conception of Saint John the Baptist by Saint Elizabeth Schaeffer, F, \"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion\", pp243-4\n \n The significance of Mary's visitation to her cousin, when the unborn St. John the Baptist leapt for joy means that we understand that personality, and life exist before birth.\n \n Isaiah 49.15 \"Can a woman forget her nursing child, and not have compassion on the son of her womb?\"\n \n \"In the light of Holy Tradition the wilful abortion of a bay by its mother is as unnatural a practice as can be imagined.\" (Ibid, p244)\n \n \n \"There are two ways of instruction, as there are two powers, that of light and that of darkness. And there is a great difference between the two ways. One is controlled by God's light-bearing angels, the other by the angels of Satan. And as the latter is the ruler of the present era of lawlessness, so the former is lauded from eternity to eternity. Among the precepts of the way of light is this; do not murder a child by abortion, or commit infanticide.\" From the Epistle of Barbanas (c.138) as quoted in Ibid, p235\n \n \"How, then is a living being conceived? Is the substance of both body and soul formed together at the same time, or does one of them precede the other? We do indeed maintain that both are conceived, formed and perfected at the same time, as they are born together; nor is there any moment intervening in their conception, which would give prior place to either. Consider the first events in the light of the last. If death is defined as nothing other than the separation of the body and soul, then life, the opposite of death, should be defined as nothing else but the union of body and soul... We acknowledge, therefore, that life begins with conception, because we content that the soul begins with conception.\" Quoted from Tertullian (208), in Ibid, p237.\n \n Among the most highly regarded of ancient Christian writings is the Didache, which dates from the late first century. [8] Its teaching is unambiguous: \"Do not murder a child by abortion or kill a newborn infant.\" Id. at II, 2. This is echoed in another didactic writing universally esteemed in the ancient Church, the Epistle of Barnabas, from the early second century: \"Never do away with an unborn child or destroy it after its birth.\" Id. at XIX, 5.\n \n The writings of the Fathers of the Church and other authorities further attest to the unanimity with which abortion was condemned. Among the earliest was the philosopher and apologist Athenagoras of Athens, who wrote to the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (c.177) to defend Christians against false charges of murder: \"What reason would we have to commit murder when we say that women who induce abortions are murderers, and will have to give account of it to God?\" [9] St. Basil the Great (c.330-379) was unequivocable: \"A woman who deliberately destroys a fetus is answerable for murder.\" [10] St. John Chrysostom (c.345-407) who in his famous homilies railed against men who secured the abortions of their illegitimate offspring, called their actions \"even worse than murder.\" Of such men who impelled women to have abortions, he said, \"You do not let a prostitute remain a prostitute, but make her a murderer as well.\" [11]\n \n Finally, Canon 91 of the Quinisext Ecumenical Council (691 A.D.), decreed that people \"who furnish drugs for the purpose of procuring abortion, and those who take fetus-killing poisons, they are made subject to the penalty prescribed for murderers.\" The same canonical position along with the opinions of individual Church Fathers, were compiled in the Photian Collection, which was adopted as the official ecclesiastical law book of the Orthodox Church in 883 A.D\"\n http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/abortion.htm",

I don't want to start any kind of a 'fight', I just want to say some things and I hope that something like this is considered in the debates.\n I am 4 months pregnant, and I just found out this week that there are a lot (9) very serious problems with the baby. None of these things can ever be medically corrected, and the baby is dying. It is considered to be a non-viable pregnancy, meaning that the baby can not survive. Because there are specific defects in the heart and brain, it can only live for a few more months, the chance that it will make it to a full 9 months are 1% and the chance that it will live after being born are basically zero. That being said, I have seen 3 specialists and have heard the same results, and I have to have the pregnancy terminated. This is not something that I really chose to do, I do have the choice not to do it and let the pregnancy continue, but as I said the baby is dying and the longer I let it go the worse things are going to get, and I would be putting my own life in danger. I am not necessarily pro-choice, I have never really got into either side of that debate, and I haven't really condemmed someone for doing that, but I knew it was something I couldn't do myself. This is a very hard thing for me, and I never pictured myself in this situation, I never even imagined I would ever have to make a choice like that, but I do have to make that choice. The baby is going to die, I don't want it to suffer any longer and I can't put my own life at risk because I have a daughter already that needs me. So, as hard as it is to actually type that and to say it to people that I don't know, I just wanted that to be said so that maybe things like this can be considered in these debates. As I said, I'm not really for or against anything, I hadn't ever had to really deal with it so I kind of stayed out of it, but now that this has happened I can say that I feel a little angry that people do it 'just because'.. I hope that no one that reads this ever HAS to make that choice, and I hope that anyone who reads it who decides to make that choice for their own personal (not medical) reasons really takes into consideration what they are doing... it's not easy, and there are people I know who know my situation and are still making judgement, but I wish that they would realize that this isn't something that I want, and I never wanted it to have to happen.\n Please consider all that, and thanks for reading this.",

I appreciate that.. and my family and friends have been really helpful...\n I was a little afraid to post that, but I think that sometimes there are sides to the story that need to be told, just to get a different view so that's why I did it... you have no idea what it's like until you are faced with it... I know that I didn't and I wish to God that I didn't have to make that choice and that the doctors were wrong or that something could be done medically, but I saw the sonogram and I saw the things wrong and there isn't anything anyone can do for the baby... I know the baby is dying and I feel like the right thing to do is let it go on its own, but I know that the longer this goes, the worse things will get and the more it will suffer and I can't do that.. I don't want anyone who reads my post to misunderstand and think that I just don't want to have it.. I do.. I planned for this baby and when you are advised that you should terminate and they tell you all the reasons why you should and what could happen if you don't, that is the worse thing you could hear... I already don't know if I can go through with it, even knowing the alternative, but I know that there will be people there protesting when I go, and I wish that they would stop to consider that while there are people there for the wrong reasons, sometimes there are people there for other reasons, and maybe they don't want to be there at all... that's why I posted that, because I hear how people think it's wrong no matter what, they don't care why you are doing it, you just shouldn't do it, but sometimes you really don't have a choice, and you have to look at what is going to happen if you don't and in this case it's worse for the baby, because even if it did live to be born, if it lived afterwards it would never live on its own without being on machines, and eventually you have to decide to turn them off, or just let it live on them and I don't think that would be fair or right... \n sorry..i'm going on and on, but thank you again for your reply...

Many women make the decision to die and save their child's life.\n\n \n Thank you for your question, and I don't mind you asking. I've found that it's a little easier to make sense of some of it when you talk about it.\n And you're right, situations like that are rare, but in this situation that is basically the case, at least so I have been told. I've been to 2 maternal-fetal specialists and 2 genetic specialists, and we have consulted with doctors at the National Institute of Health and everything has been the same. That being said, I will tell a little of what we are dealing with.. at this point, they have found 8 specific things wrong, and some of these things on their own aren't so bad, but they are more severe than normal, and combined with the other things are life threatening to the baby. The baby has cystic hygroma, which is a tumor that is filled with lymph fluid, and that same fluid is also on the head so that it is 2 times the normal size. They can't do anything to get the fluid out, and the only thing that could be done with the tumor is to remove it and they just have no way to do that. It has hypoplastic left heart, which is basically underdevelopment of the left side of the heart, but in this case it's not there at all. This eventually causes heart failure because right side of the heart is doing the job of the right and left sides alone, and the heart has already started to fail. The lungs are seriously underdeveloped, I think they said that they are developed to the point of what they would be at 2 months, but they have stopped and won't develop anymore, and they won't be able to function at all. Another thing is called omphalocele, and that basically means that the baby's intestines are outside of the body and protruding into the umbilical cord and not inside the body where they should be. There is a mass on the umbilical cord itself, which can rupture at any time, which is what would put my life at risk, since I wouldn't have an immediate knowledge that it had done that. There are other problems with the umbilical cord, and it is missing things that need to be there to get nutrients to the baby. Some of these things can be medically corrected later on if they weren't so severe, but they have told me that there is no way to correct any of it, just because of how bad they are. I have to see another geneticist to have more tests done so they can determine why all of this happened, because this many severe anomalities is very very rare, and they aren't sure yet what caused it, but they think it is a chromosal thing. \n And you're right also in saying that a lot of women would put their own life at risk to save their child's, but the baby is dying and they can't save it. The prognosis of survival is maybe two more months at the most, the chance of survival to the full 9 months is less than 1% and if it made it that far the chance of survival after birth is less than zero. I have probably driven my doctors crazy with all the phone calls and questions, but the answers have all been the same, and I can wait it out and let it go on its own, but they say that medically that isn't the right choice. Morally speaking, I do feel the best choice is to wait it out. I know that the baby is dying, and there is nothing I can do to change that, and nothing any doctor can change, but the more advanced the pregnancy gets the more complications there are, and I can't put my own life in danger knowing these facts. That's not a selfish decision that I made for myself, I made that decision because I have a little girl that needs me and I don't want to take the chance of making her grow up without her mother. A lot of the decisions I'm making are being based on that. If I knew there was ANY remote chance for this baby, there wouldn't be a decision at all, but I can't change the facts, and I know exactly what is going on and what the outcome is going to be.\n But I do thank you for reading my post and for your questions.. I hope this helps a little....",

I understand your case is rare, and I would allow such cases to be legal. However, in every single other case, abortion is wrong. Do you agree?\n\n \n Well, first of all, I think you misunderstood me. I don't believe it is right for a woman to have an abortion because she finds out that her baby is going to be handicapped. If the doctors had told me that, I would have the baby, no question. If I knew that the baby had any chance of survival, I would have it... but any risk to me aside, the baby is dying, and isn't going to make it long enough to even be born. I wish they had only told me that it could be born with a physical and/or mental disability, but it isn't. If that were all that were wrong, but I still knew I was at risk, I would probably take that chance then... but I can't truly say what I would do because I wasn't faced with that.. if the baby had chance to live, I would be looking at things a lot differently than I am. The doctors have told me the severity of the defects and the combination of them is lethal, and the baby stopped developing at between 2 and 3 months.. I am 4 months now. My doctor told me it is very rare to have this many defects present all at once, and they are a lot more severe than normal, which is also very rare, which is why she sent me to several specialists and geneticists. They don't know yet why it happened, but I have had tests done so hopefully I will have some kind of answers soon. I told my doctors that, knowing the baby is already dying, I feel the best thing for me to do is to let it 'go' on its own.. they said that was my choice, but they strongly advised against it.. one doctor flat out said not to do it.. I don't think they would have recommended a termination if they thought there was any type of chance. So all I can do is look at my options, and weigh them, and try to figure out what is the best choice for everyone involved.. it may not be the 'right' choice, but no matter what I do I will always wonder if I did the right thing. I can either go against the doctors, and carry out the pregnancy for as long as the baby lives, even knowing that the baby is dying, and that as it progresses the problems get worse and eventually will put my own life in danger, and if something goes wrong I die with the baby, not instead of it, or I can terminate it now before things get worse and continue to be a mother to my daughter and one day have another child and pray that things won't be like this again. No matter which choice I make, the baby is going to die, and I can't save it and neither can any doctor.\n But no, under normal circumstances I don't think it's right... just because I am going through this doesn't mean I think it's right.. unfortunately I have had a few friends who have had them as a sort of 'birth control', and I was so disappointed in them, but I figured it was their own choice... I just knew it was not the choice for me. Even now, I don't believe it's the right choice, but I'm thinking of my daughter in this.... if I didn't have her I probably wouldn't really give a damn if I lived or died...\n \n I also wanted to say that I didn't post any of that on here to try to change anyone's mind about what they believe is right or wrong, and I know it technically probably doesn't qualify as a 'debate'. But I realized that there are sides to this that I, at least, hadn't thought of before, so I wanted to sort of share what I was going through to maybe give a view of things from a more personal standpoint.",

But for things like that, no I don't think its right.. I don't think it should be used as a type of 'birth control', which is basically what they did and I know of a lot of other girls that have done it for that type of reason... when it's cases like that, there are other alternatives. I had my daughter when I was 20, and I didn't think I was really 'ready' to settle down then either, but that wasn't her fault and I never once considered not having her.. and I have never regretted it.. I grew up a lot and I think she changed me for the better. :) And yeah, it's hard and a little scary sometimes, but in most cases, it's not the end of the world either. \n I can't speak for everyone though... sometimes people are going through different things than you realize.. and to them, maybe it is the end of the world.. who knows.\n \n But I'm not looking at it as the baby is going to die anyways.. not at all.. if there weren't any risk to me I wouldn't even be considering this, even though the doctors say they would still recommend it with all that is going on.

Again, I wish you all the best.\n\n \n I did get my amniocentesis tests back, so they now have a 'name' for what is wrong. It's called trisomy 18 syndrome, and it happens when one parent passes along 2 chromosomes, when each parent is supposed to only pass one. So they say that there are 3 copies of chromosome 18 present in each metaphase cell, and all they can tell me is that it is something that just 'happens', but now that they know exactly what is wrong, I have to go to another genetic specialist and have tests done again... I don't know if they will be able to tell me which one of us passed the extra chromosome, or why, but if they can tell me I would like to know. Down's syndrome is trisomy 21 sydrome, so I think it is the same type of thing, only this sydrome is fatal.. they said that typically 90% of the time the fetus will miscarry on its own, and then the 10% that make after that have a 95% chance of stillbirth, while the other 5% won't make it to a year. So the odds aren't good at all, and in my case the problems are more severe than usual so I don't even have those chances. I knew that things were bad, but hearing the actual figures on everything makes me realize how bad they really are. I was told that the majority of the time, it is women who are in their 40s or older that have this happen, and I'm only 24, so now my chance of something like this happening again are 20%... the only good thing with that is now that the doctors know, if I get pregnant again they will immediately do tests to see if anything is wrong. The trisomy 18 syndrome isn't necessarily putting me at risk, but they had found some type of mass or tumor on the umbilical cord and they don't think it is related, but they are afraid that it is going to rupture. So far no one knows what it is.. at least they haven't told me.\n They did tell me that the baby's heart rate has slowed down significantly since last week, but my doctor is still telling me to have the termination asap and I don't understand why now, and no one is really giving me any answers anymore. \n I was scheduled to have it done yesterday, but now I have been moved to next week because they have around 20,000 protesters there and apparently they are getting violent and throwing rocks and dragging women off as they are trying to get in the door. They told me that even though my situation is different, these people won't understand that so they don't want me there right now. If I still have to go next week and that is still going on, I'm going back home. On top of everything else going on, and knowing why I am there, I can't deal with having rocks thrown at me and being drug off and called a murderer. I wish these people would try to realize that sometimes women are not there for the reasons they think they are, and they are holding up signs that say pro-life and at the same time throwing rocks and trying to slap the women across the face. Sorry.. I'm just mad... this is already hard and it just keeps getting worse.. \n \n \n But I think it is a little funny that you asked that about work conditions, I asked that myself because my husband is a chemist at a cement plant and he works with hazardous wastes, but they said nothing he works with could cause this.. I don't know whether I believe that, because he wasn't working there when I was pregnant with my daughter, and I wondered if that's why I didn't have any problems with her.. but there are a lot of incidences of cancer and brain tumors around here in the last few years (my neice was the first with a brain tumor) and a lot of people are blaming the place he works.. so I wonder if there is a link somewhere. My family and I just think it's weird that my neice suddenly got this after being very healthy for 14 years, and now I have this happen to me.. so hopefully soon we can find something out.",

I wanted to share this story because I hadn't seen any other personal accounts on this topic, and I though that maybe it would help shed a little insight on a different view of it, and it has also helped me to talk about it a little.\n Normally, these protesters aren't allowed onto the actual property of where I am going, but I don't think they had expected this many at one time, and I've been told that by the time I have to go, things will have calmed down, and because of the circumstances, I will be taken in a different way and escorted, so I shouldn't have to be in contact with them at all. I do still wish that none of this had happened, but I've started to come to terms with it.\n I do want to thank everyone who has given their support on here, and that means a lot considering none of you even know me! It is really appreciated. :)",

   "Puh-lease. Weren't you the one who said not to bring \"emotion\" into the debate?\n \n I think the fetus is a human being, it is just a human being at such an early stage of development that it does not think or feel as it does later in its development. In this stage of development, it is still part of the mother's body.\n\n The fetus is definatly an human being and research has shown that it has it's own DNA and is a seperate entity from the mother. It is dependant upon the mother for it's development (somewhat like a parasite) but it is not a part of the mother's body as her own organs are etc. It may not \"think\" in reasonable terms as you or I but neither does a full term newborn baby. As for feeling pain it has been shown that at a very early stage there are brain waves and a response to painful stimulous.",

   "I think the technical term fetus applies all the way up to birth after it has stopped being an embryo. Pure terminology isn't going to help decide the issue as I tink the requirement for being a fetus is when it is recognisably human.\n \n A fetus is human, but it isn't the point, what matters is when it is a person. A human can not actually be detirmined scientifically, no species can as the entire concept is arteficial and doesn't really apply to the real world. Even by comparison, if you took a sample from an adult human, or a whole load of adult humans to make a standard, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference unless you were looking at specific genes between a fetus/embryo or a cancer cell (which is self sustaining, capable of replication and will have a different genentic code from its parent). You could distinguish both from a chimp or a mouse but the two would fit your genetic defintion of human.\n \n I would say it is wrong to abort once the central nervous sytem has become developed and the fetus is capable of concious thought. Makes perfect sense as the thing we prize in humans is the brain and it is this what we use to define individuals (otherwise amputation would be considered murder), until this point as far as the fetus is concerned there is no difference from it being aborted and it just existing.",
