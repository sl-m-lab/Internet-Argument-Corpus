   "Here is a copy of a letter I've sent to the newspaper, in reply to an anti-gun letter.\n \n \"Greg Harris (\"Guns! We don't want them\" October 24) has an admirable goal in reducing crime and making our country a safer place.\n \n Unfortunately, Greg has focused on the wrong statistics and, while the numbers he uses are correct, he has given Herald Sun readers an incomplete picture. Please bear in mind when reading the following facts that the firearms laws were tightened in 1996 as a result of the Port Arthur tragedy.\n \n Rates of homicide and related crimes have climbed from 975 before 1996 to an average of 997 in the following years. Rates of robbery, both armed and unarmed have climbed from 15,564 before the thighter gun laws to a staggering average of 22,619. Interestingly, armed robbery rates almost doubled after the 1996 Firearms act. Also, unlawful entry with the intent to commit a crime has gone from 385,162 before 1996 to an average of 413,249. Similar climbs have been seen in the rates of assault and sexual assault.\n \n One can also compare both the volume of legally owned firearms and the rates of homicide for other developed nations. Such studies invariably reveal that the rate of homicide is completely unrelated to the rate of firearm ownership. Simply put, guns don't kill people.\n \n In summary, tightening gun laws has had no posititive effect on our crime rates. Unlike Mr Harris, I won't try and link the rates of crime to rates of gun ownership. In fact, I believe they are totally isolated of one another. As such, tightening gun laws in order to prevent crime is an ineffective and ill-informed reaction that ignores the real issues and causes of crimes.\"\n \n Thoughts? Opinions?",

   "Was your 1996 legislation tightening gun laws enacted by popular vote or representation?\n\n \n No. In 1996 there was a shooting massacre in Port Arthur, in the countries south. The new government had just been voted in, and it was their first act, right on the back of this massacre, to tighten gun laws up significantly. Riding on the back of public horror at the massacre, it was rushed through, approved by both the upper and lower houses, and made law.",
