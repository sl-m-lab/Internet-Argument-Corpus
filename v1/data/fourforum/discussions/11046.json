   "By CHARLES BABINGTON, Associated Press Writer \n 1 hour, 15 minutes ago\n \n COLUMBUS, Miss. - Democrat Barack Obama ridiculed the idea of being Hillary Rodham Clinton's running mate Monday, saying voters must choose between the two for the top spot on the fall ticket. \n \n The Illinois senator used his first public appearance of the week to knock down the notion that he might accept the party's vice presidential nomination. He noted that he has won more states, votes and delegates than Clinton so far.\n \n \"I don't know how somebody who is in second place is offering the vice presidency to the person who is first place,\" Obama said, drawing cheers and a long standing ovation from about 1,700 people in Columbus, Miss.\n \n Saying he wanted to be \"absolutely clear,\" he added: \"I don't want anybody here thinking that somehow, 'Well, you know, maybe I can get both.' Don't think that way. You have to make a choice in this election.\"\n \n \"I am not running for vice president,\" Obama said. \"I am running for president of the United States of America.\"\n \n Obama aides said Clinton's recent hints that she might welcome him as her vice presidential candidate appeared meant to diminish him and to attract undecided voters in the remaining primary states by suggesting they can have a \"dream ticket.\"\n \n Obama had never suggested he might accept a second spot on the ticket. But until Monday he had not ridiculed the notion so directly, even if he did completely rule it out in Shermanesque terms.\n \n He told the audience that it made no sense for Clinton to suggest he is not ready to be president and then hint that she might hand him the job that could make him president at a moment's notice.\n \n \"If I'm not ready, how is it that you think I should be such a great vice president?\" he said, as the crowd laughed and cheered loudly.\n \n Mississippi holds it primary Tuesday, the last contest before the Pennsylvania primary six weeks from now.\n \n Clinton and her husband, the former president, had suggested recently that a Clinton-Obama ticket would be popular and formidable against Republican Sen. John McCain in November.\n \n Many political activists discounted the notion all along. They noted that the two senators lack a warm relationship and, more important, that Obama would be ill-served by hinting he might accept the vice presidential slot when he holds the lead in delegates and hopes to win the presidential nomination.\n \n In the latest Associated Press count, Obama leads Clinton, 1,578-1,472. He has won 28 contests to her 17.\n \n Moreover, many insiders feel the ambitious and fast-rising Obama would chafe in the vice president's job, especially in a White House where Bill Clinton would almost surely play a huge advisory role.\n \n Still, the notion of a Clinton-Obama ticket has received ample discussion in recent days on cable TV news shows and newspapers such as New York City's tabloids.\n \n In an interview Friday in Wyoming with KTVQ-TV, a CBS affiliate based in Billings, Mont., Obama's comments were somewhat mixed.\n \n \"Well, you know, I think it's premature,\" he said of accepting the second spot on the ticket. \"You won't see me as a vice presidential candidate.\"\n \n His Monday remarks were more detailed, pointed and humorous. \n \n Of course, they will not completely end the speculation. Presidential candidates routinely disavow any interest in the vice presidential spot. But some, including John Edwards and Al Gore, change their minds when they fall short of their top goal.\n\n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080310/ap_on_el_pr/obama_ticket\n \n Is Hillary really this arrogant? I mean seriously, it's highly likely that they will end up as running mates in the end anyway, but come on. He's ahead in delegates and she wants him as her vice presidential candidate? It seems now that she would like to forget about the rest of the primaries, and just have the DNC appoint her as their candidate. More Clinton end-run tactics? Things like this should serve as a warning to the American people.",

That would be suicide.\n \n Hillary would never choose Barrack as VP because she will hold a grudge against him forever for destroying her unobstructed rise to the ultimate position of power and for forcing her to taste defeat...over and over and over.

He doesn't like her. She's still got skeletons in the closet that remain undisclosed. She's passionate enough about being the leader that she wouldn't hesitate to arrange his snuffing and have it look like someone else planned it.\n \n She'd be the last bitch on earth before I'd choose her to be next in line for the big stick.",

   "Obama will never offer her the VP slot. It would immediately make him look weak before he even won the contest for the Presidency. Beside being a suicidal move as isly made clear. She is attempting to blackmail/force him into offering her the job to basically get her to finally quit the race. So he will never buckle under to that very public coercion. \n \n I believe he will meet with her and offer her a sweet cabinet post that she may want. I'm not saying he would actually give it to her if he wins the general election, but he will offer it to her if she will agree to campaign for him with a sincere attempt to get him elected.",

It would undermine Obama's authority too much. You can't be effective if you're constantly looking over your shoulder or having to fight for the Democratic spotlight. They simply aren't compatible at this point IMHO, her attitude is glaring evidence of that.\n \n If Hilary truly is about \"the best thing for her country\", and not the best thing for Hilary, she'll throw her complete support behind Obama and the Democrats, likely in exchange for a cozy position somewhere that she can still court the spotlight she so craves.\n \n Waxy",
