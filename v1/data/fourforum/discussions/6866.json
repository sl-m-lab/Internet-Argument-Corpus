   "People, there needs to be more platonic kissing in his country. That's right, you heard me. A wild and crazy idea. Friends and family should kiss each other.\n \n We have a weird issue revolving around touch in our culture. It is stupid and unhealthy. Yes, yes, I know, more people hug each other nowadays than they did 15, 20 years ago. But it really isn't all that much of a step. Most of these hugs are wimpy little \"Ok, we're going to hug but touch as little as possible and not squeeze\" things. They're stupid. Embrace each other for crying out loud. Is it really so hard?",
