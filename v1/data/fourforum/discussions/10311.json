   "Romney and Mccain do not believe gay people are american citizens.\n http://www.365gay.com/Newscon07/08/083107iowafolo.htm\n \n\"The ruling in Iowa ... is another example of an activist court and unelected judges trying to redefine marriage and disregard the will of the people as expressed through Iowa's Defense of Marriage Act,\" Romney said in a statement shortly after the ruling was made. \"This once again highlights the need for a Federal Marriage Amendment to protect the traditional definition of marriage as between one man and one woman.\"\n\n If gay people are not apart of the people then what are we? Statements like this show that he does not consider the couples who sued for their civil rights, or gay people in general, to be american citizens and part of the people.",
