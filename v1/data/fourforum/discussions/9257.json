   "Hey guys, \n \n I have been reading a lot that the war in Iraq is a mistake, that it is comparable to Vietnam war, that the US troops need to withdraw as soon as possible. I simply do not agree. I think that the media reports, especially those from CNN and other democratic channels are simply exaggerated. I agree with the author of this article http://www.europeancourier.org/19.htm who points out many genuine benefits of the war in Iraq. His analysis is academic and scientific so he can not be accused of supporting any particular party's agenda. I think it is a good thing that US troops stay in Iraq and continue to fight. I hope they will not be withdrawn and that Baker's group will suggest something really worth considering. In my opinion we need to continue this war to secure our freedom and national security in the future.",
