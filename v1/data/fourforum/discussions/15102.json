It is rampant throughout the moslem world and has existed since Mohamed's time. And the attitude of the man referred to above who had to be told how to impregnate his wife is precisely why this cultural confusion exists. Women have long been seen as unclean and inferior creatures to men in that culture so why would men feel the desire to be intimate with them?",

Does this mean that prison induces homosexuality or that the men use each other for sexual release.",

The pederasty of Roman and Greek culture, and the sexual practices of that country are meaningless outside of their culture, but reproduction has significance to humans as a species.\n \n Heterosexuality has an obvious advantage in this area.",
