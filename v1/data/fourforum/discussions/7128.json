   "He may be planning to buy them back when the stock drops further. Meanwhile he takes a loss on this year's taxes. But I think it is time for the fat lady to sing for GM. As far as I can tell, they are terminal. Their P/E is in negative territory. If the Delphi situation cannot be resolved they could literally be out of business within three months or so. They would burn through $4 billion a month. Their total capitalization is under $12 billion. They bought off the UAW during the fat years; now the lean years have come and they are up a creek without a paddle. I can't dial up a lot of sympathy for them. It would be best if they just bit the bullet and filed for Chapter 11. Shutter Pontiac, Buck, Saab and Saturn and retain the Chevrolet and Cadillac brands and consider merging with Ford. Or just liquidate altogether. It may come to that anyway.",

But isn't that like GM proudly stating it had come to a 'satisfactory' agreement with its labor unions and in the next breath admitting it wasn't good enough to resolve the problem? \n \n Neither Ford or GM have released projections for downsized production in the form of market share, operating margins or earnings. We know they have them, business plan models are now so sophisticated management can easily see the future on a daily basis. \n \n I think both Ford and GM are trying to buy time to build in China in anticipation of that market. If you look at Delphi only the US pieces are in trouble, only the US pieces were chaptered and they're prepared to continue US production only at wage/benefit levels allowing them to be competitive on a global scale. Until Ford and GM reach that state, IMO impossible with entrenched, existing management, they're going to continue throwing good money at bad business.",

I can't see how he keeps his job much longer.\n \n This is not an emotional issue with me. I have Ford products but I don't believe that brand is going into the tank and it will somehow be an orphan brand.\n \n I don't have the numbers in front of me, but if my memory is correct, GM's \"legacy costs\" are about $300 billion. Ford's is about $100 billion. GM has far more retired workers than does Ford and now they must pay those pension and medical care benefits.

My arithmetic says that is about 4-5 months and their cap is $0. \n \n What does GM have to bring to the market? A larger and \"improved\" SUV? Please. \n \n If I were running the company I would dump Buick, Pontiac, GMC, Saturn and Saab immediately. Then I would go to the UAW with Chapter 11 papers in hand and give them an ultimatum. Essentially it would be a message that the gravy train is over. Either capitulate and cut the labor and legacy costs by a minimum of 50% or the papers will be filed that afternoon. It is either do it or get off the pot. And the clock is ticking. It is about 11:59 and GM will turn into a pumpkin. The fat lady is about to sing.\n \n Ford stayed with the SUV market too long; that is true. But their new auto models are really quite good. They are here and available for sale. The F-150 will still sell about 900,000 units this year and for my money is still the superior product. The Volvo line is doing just fine. They need to dump the Jaguar as it is not profitable. Should never have bought it. Probably the same with Land Rover. I most emphatically do not agree with you that the Ford line of products is uncompetitive. I wouldn't have bought mine if I thought otherwise. Name me a competitor to the Ford Escape Hybrid that I own. There isn't one. Name a better truck than the F-150. There isn't one. The new Ford Fusion was barely edged out in recent ratings by the Honda Accord and just barely but handily beating the Toyota Camry which came in dead last. (I believe this was in Car and Driver.) The Ford Explorer is still the overall best in its class. The new 500 is starting to catch on well. The Ford Mustang has been doing very well. What am I missing here? Compare that to the nothingburgers that GM is offering. The Solstice is a fine looking small car but that can't sustain the company. The Saab is just a money pit and should be killed off. The idiotic deals with Fiat and Suburu cost about $3 billion. This is a company that can't shoot straight. \n \n If GM does file, the UAW will capitulate on Ford as well or take the consequences. The old ways of doing business just won't do any more. The retirees will probably scream bloody murder and the news hours will show the predictable bawling and squawling. But right now the labor costs average out to about $137,000 per employee and retiree. How ridiculous is that for essentially unskilled workers?\n \n As difficult as this may be to believe, the U.S. auto market is going great guns. In point of fact we have about 2,000,000 more auto workers today than we used have working right here in the U.S. They just happen to be working for Japanese and German nameplate manufacturers.\n \n I'm sorry to say it but if a company ever deserved to go bankrupt, GM is certainly well deserving. This is a problem of their own making. They bribed the unions in the fat years and now they are in the lean years and rapidly running out of time.\n \n BTW, I don't own very much Ford stock.

   "As I predicted, GM's stock is down again to a new low of $18.40 but it has come up just a bit in the half hour or so. Market cap now down to $10.5 billion. In any event I believe your figures for legacy costs are understated I am relatively certain that I have read it was closer to $300 billion (perhaps it was for all unfunded liabilities.) But putting that aside for now, let me quote from the WSJ of this past Wednesday, just two days ago.\n \n \"At yesterday's stock price, GM's market capitalization is less than $12 billion, and less than the $19 billion GM's automotice operations had on hand as of September 30....Mr. Wagoner said in a recent statement, however, that GM has no plans to seek Chapter 11 protection....\n \n Sounds to me like the vote of confidence that the baseball manager is always given the day before he is fired.\n \n \n (on the previous page is a full page ad for Ford's new Fusion with all of the statements made by the automotive magazines.)\n \n And then there is this:\n \n Firm Seeks Lead Plaintiff For Suit Vs GM Over Accounting\n December 22, 2005\n \n DETROIT -(Dow Jones)- A national class-action law firm is on the hunt for a lead plaintiff in a suit against General Motors Corp. (GM) over alleged misrepresentation of the company's financial performance in recent years.\n \n Leach Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins LLP issued a press release Thursday saying GM issued \"numerous positive statements and filed quarterly and annual reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission which described the company's financial performance.\" The firm, known for taking on corporations that are under SEC scrutiny or have filed for bankruptcy, said GM's statements \"were materially false and misleading.\"\n \n In 2005, Leach Coughlin has built a reputation going after other embattled companies on behalf of disgruntled shareholders. The list includes Guidant Corp. (GDT), Refco Inc. (RFXCQ), WorldCom Inc. and Enron Corp.\n \n Leach Coughlin points to a GM's revelation in November that it overstated income for 2001 by as much as $300 million to $400 million, which is equivalent to about 50% of the profit it reported at the time. The company said it \"erroneously\" booked credits from suppliers.\n \n GM's admission came after the market close Nov. 9, which had been a rough day for the auto maker's already-sluggish stock. Shares of GM closed that day down $1.23, or nearly 5%, at $24.63, thanks in part to a Fitch rating cut of GM's debt further into junk status.\n \n GM's accounting trouble comes amid an ongoing probe by the SEC into the auto maker's insurance and pension practices.\n \n The law firm has set its class period for between April 18, 2001 and Nov. 19, 2005.

   "Auto news\n Union OKs Ford health care deal\n \n Slim margin raises doubts Chrysler will approve cuts\n \n December 23, 2005\n \n BY SARAH A. WEBSTER\n \n FREE PRESS BUSINESS WRITER\n \n UAW members at Ford Motor Co. have narrowly approved a landmark health care agreement that will cost workers and retirees more money out-of-pocket but save the still-profitable automaker about $850 million a year.\n \n The shockingly slim 51% majority vote by Ford hourly workers, announced by the union Thursday, follows a thin 61% approval in November by hourly workers at the money-losing General Motors Corp., which was the first automaker to renegotiate health care benefits with the union.\n \n The close vote raises questions about whether the Chrysler Group -- the healthiest automaker in town -- will get its union workers to approve a similar deal to cut their own benefits.\n \n Matt Davidson, who has been an hourly UAW worker at Chrysler for seven years, said he's doubtful that his peers will vote to approve a deal, even though he doesn't object to paying a little more. That the company is doing so well, he said, is a key factor.\n \n \"Chrysler might be the only one to turn it down, to be honest with you,\" said Davidson, a line technician at Warren Truck Assembly Plant, where Dodge Rams and Dakotas are built. \"It's going to be a lot harder for them to convince the rank and file.\"\n \n The narrow approvals at GM and Ford show the reluctance of UAW members to shoulder more of the health care burden, even as their companies struggle financially and cut jobs. Workers at Chrysler, which isn't facing such grim circumstances, are less likely to follow suit.\n \n For now, the GM and Ford deals are moving ahead.\n \n On Thursday, a U.S. District Court in Detroit granted preliminary approval of the UAW deal with GM, which will save the world's largest automaker an estimated $1 billion annually and cut its long-term health care obligations by $15 billion.\n \n U.S. District Judge Robert H. Cleland has scheduled a hearing for March 6 and 7 to determine whether the GM-UAW agreement is fair, reasonable and adequate. And while GM retirees, spouses and dependents who are affected by the pact have been certified as a class, they will have to file an objection in writing with the court on or before Feb. 13 to be heard at the hearing.\n \n The federal court also will need to approve the deal at Ford and any similar agreement that may be reached with Chrysler, which is slated to begin talks with the union on a health care pact in January.\n \n Typically, the UAW negotiates a similar contract, called a pattern agreement, with GM, Ford and Chrysler so they are equally competitive in the marketplace. The latest health care deals are unusual, however, because they are being negotiated in the middle of the current national labor contract, which doesn't expire until September 2007.\n \n Under the new deals at GM and Ford, retirees would pay new premiums and higher co-payments and deductibles. The maximum annual out-of-pocket costs for retirees at both companies would be the same: $370 for individuals and $752 for families.\n \n For individuals, those figures include $120 in monthly contributions, $150 in yearly deductibles and $100 in coinsurance. For families, those figures include $252 in monthly contributions, $300 in yearly deductibles and $200 in coinsurance.\n \n Active workers, meanwhile, would divert some of their pay increases into a fund to pay for their health care.\n \n But UAW members might not be eager to take on any extra expenses in the middle of a contract if they don't feel it's absolutely necessary.\n \n At GM, the situation is clearly problematic, which may have easily encouraged a majority of workers to vote to give up benefits before 2007. The automaker posted a loss of $3.8 billion through the first nine months of the year, and its North American operations posted an even wider loss of $4.8 billion during that period.\n \n In a joint motion filed in federal court, GM and the UAW wrote that the automaker's \"financial situation is distressed to the point that its long-term viability is questionable without the institution of significant cost-saving measures.\"\n \n Ford's situation is also troubled, but it might not have been bad enough to convince an overwhelming number of workers that a change was necessary before the current contract expires. Sales for Ford are down 4.6% this year through November, and the company's North American operations posted a pretax loss of $2.1 billion for the first nine months of the year. But, overall, Ford is still profitable, earning $1.9 billion through September.\n \n At Chrysler, the need for cost-saving measures may be even less convincing to workers...\n \n (Snip) \n \n http://freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2005512230404",

   "Consumers Wouldn't Buy From Bankrupt Car Maker - Survey\n December 23, 2005\n \n \n By Stephen Wisnefski\n Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\n \n CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- If General Motors Corp. (GM) executives start looking at bankruptcy as an increasingly viable option for the world's largest auto maker, they may want to consider the following: nearly three-quarters of Americans wouldn't buy a car from a bankrupt company.\n \n According to data released Friday by Directions Research Inc., only 26% of those polled in a recent survey said they would purchase or lease a new car from an automotive manufacturer that had declared bankruptcy. The rest said they wouldn't.\n \n GM lost nearly $5 billion in its North American automotive business in the first nine months of 2005, and speculation has mounted among investors that the auto maker may eventually be forced to file for Chapter 11 protection. Company executives have denied they consider bankruptcy an option, but the company faces a laundry list of problems that promises to keep the talk alive.\n \n U.S. auto makers are struggling to turn a profit as they lose market share to foreign auto makers with leaner cost structures. Several auto parts makers - most notably Delphi Corp. (DPHIQ), a former GM unit and its leading supplier - have been forced into bankruptcy. GM recently announced it would close 12 North American manufacturing plants as part of a plan to cut $7 billion in costs per year.\n \n Should GM's current restructuring efforts fail, bankruptcy could help get the company's cost structure in order, but it wouldn't set the auto maker back on the path to profitability if consumers won't buy the company's cars...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.smartmoney.com/news/ON/index.cfm?story=ON-20051223-000741-1917",
