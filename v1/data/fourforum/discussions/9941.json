   "I think we all agree that, in the great majority of cases (outside of self-defense, war, etc.), it is morally wrong to kill other people. The question I want to address here is WHY? I think those on the pro-life side and those on the pro-choice side may have different reasons for why they think that it is wrong to kill people and those reasons can be directly applied to the abortion debate. Note, here we are not talking about the law but our own personal moral stance about why we think such killing is wrong.\n \n So, why do you personally think it is morally wrong to kill other people? Please, then, relate that to the abortion debate.\n \n ---\n \n I, for one, believe it is wrong to kill other people for two basic reasons:\n 1. I do not kill others since I would not like to be killed. This is a subset of the general moral approach which I take which involves treating others as I would expect to be treated if I were in their situation.\n 2. I do not kill others because I have empathy toward the suffering, sense of loss, pain, etc. that they would experience and that empathy drives my moral repulsion at killing un-necessarily.\n \n The way this relates to the abortion debate is that both of these points apply only once the fetus gains mental existence. I cannot empathize with a living entity that has no mind whatsoever just like I cannot empathize with an inanimate object. Also, in treating others as I would expect to be treated, I do not see myself as having existed until I did so mentally (around the beginning of the third trimester). Therefore, if my mother had aborted me before that time, nobody would have been hurt since there was \"nobody home\" in that developing body. Sure, I am glad that she did not abort me, but I am equally glad that they did not use contraception, that they chose each other as partners, or any other event that had to happen for my existence to happen.\n \n For me, then, the reasons I hold for not killing people in general, would have me not have a late term fetus killed unless very necessary (ex. threat to mother's life, severe health risk, etc.).",

I certainly do not think that I am \"god\" or that everyone has to revolve around my standard. However, I do think that morality has to have a rational basis behind it. This is my particular rational basis. \n \n My moral code certainly isn't my own invention but is based on the moral codes which I have often heard expressed by others, as well as the moral code of the German philosopher Kant (often referenced in secular moral discussions). Most people from childhood are taught morals at least partly from the same points of view I use. After all, how often have you heard the phrase \"How would YOU like it if that happenned to you?\" or something similar. That is essentially the same as my basis of morality. It seems to be very common. Even many religions use a similar basic appoach - \"Do unto others...\". Of course, we all differ enough in our psychology that we might have some differences in how we would expect to be treated by others. So, this approach that I present would not lead to the same result in all people. Also, this approach depends on the capabilities of the person to see the big picture and to be able to fully see things from the other person's point of view. Since we are imperfect in these skills, it certainly helps to have moral discussions, moral mentors, etc. who can enlighten us in various situations. It is not a perfect method but at least it is not arbitrary since it is based on reason. Note that the famous German philosopher Kant gave a similar secular moral code in his Categorical Imperative: \"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law\".\n \n Your view doesn't seem to be based on reason but on a blind trust in a religious authority that tells you that a particular set of rules is right and must not be questioned. For those of us who do not hold the same beliefs as you, those rules often seem quite arbitrary. Sometimes some of the reasons behind those rules are illucidated, often not. Sometimes the rules are the same as those derived by secular reasoning, sometimes not. \n \n Personally, I would prefer an imperfect moral code that at least is based on reason and is refineable to one that is immovable and based on arbitrary standards.\n \n On a last note, there certainly could be moral codes that are based neither on religion nor on some version of the moral code which I have presented. If so, I would be quite interested in hearing them.",

From all of those, I have gleaned a morality that works best for me, where my moral code seems to be quite a common one. The moral rules which I accepted were typically the ones which gave the reasons behind them and whose base assumptions I agreed with. The moral rules which I rejected were typically the ones which gave no supporting reasons or whose base assumptions I disagreed with. I suspect that you assume that if a morality is not grounded in religious rules, then it becomes based on selfishness. That is not true. We are all inspired by heroes that sacrifice themselves for others - be they secular or religious (as Jesus himself can be viewed as a hero). \n \n There is a lot of overlap in morality between secular morality and religious (mainly Christian) morality - against theft, murder, etc. However, I find too many of the religious rules very arbitrary (such as the anti-Gay propaganda, some religion's ban on contraceptives, the idea of the infalibility of the pope, etc.) that I certainly will not follow religious rules blindly. Furthermore, so much of religious morality was determined simply by religious men who were set in the local morality of their time and attached that morality to the religion. Even if Jesus was divine, it would be very hard today to know how to throw away all the junk morality that was added after his time and extract the pure origin.",

Though I don't blame the people of particular religions (mainstream Islam comes to mind) for the acts of their extremists, I do think that they hold some responsibility for setting those extremist straight by publically denouncing their acts and their distorted faith.\n \n However, another way of distorting a religion which you have not commented on is historical distortion. Christianity started off with very little information about Jesus and layers and layers of interpretation were added later to the religion until it would be very hard to discover what the origin was (assuming that there is a divine origin). The Council of Nicea used a combination of politics and religious reasoning to try to exclude all Christian views other than the proto-orthodox. Medieval times also added significantly to Christian doctrine, as did the Reformation. It seems that Christianity has gone through intermittent spurts of creative adjustment throughout history that couldn't help but be affected by the mentality and understanding of their time. I would think that any reasonable faith has to take into account the history of one's religion and when and why certain aspects and moral rules were introduced. For example, Islam prohibits eating pork. I have heard that this was for the good of the people at that ancient time since pork would go bad much faster than other meats - thus causing illness. Such a rule would be far more irrelevant now that we have refrigeration. Why follow outdated religious moral rules?",

Others who knew and loved me would be caused suffering. Those are the first reasons that come to mind. These reasons are based on observations of myself and others - i.e. evidence. Evidence is all around me that nearly all methods of killing cause suffering. I have evidence from a lifetime of experience that physical pain without good purpose is a very bad experience for me that I would avoid at all costs. Evidence is all around me that my loved ones would miss me if I died - they miss me enough when I leave for extended periods of time. I could go on and on. My observations of myself and others (EVIDENCE) determine the basis of my moral beliefs.\n \n As for not killing others because I do not want to be killed, there are two fold reasons for that. I already mentioned the first - empathy, which I, and apparently (from observation and the few passages I have heard from psychologists) most people possess the capability of having. The second reason is a type of moral consensus - a moral deal with the rest of humanity. I will treat you well if you treat me well. Most people seem to possess some level of reasoning along those lines - at least most people that I have ever heard discuss the subject. If I were thrust into a situation (such as wartime) where this moral consensus completely breaks down, then all I would really have left is empathy and the choice whether to keep to a one-sided consensus.\n \n Anyway, I have shown that my moral stance is based on a combination of observation (evidence) and reasoning based on that observation. \n \nYou judge it based upon your definition of reason and based upon your own desires. This is where the \"god\" thing came in. You can't judge something unless you have something to judge it against.\n Faith in your ability to reason as just a small example. See above for another\n\n I judge it against my observations of how various types of actions affect myself and others, and use reasoning from that point on. Of course, my reasoning can be flawed, which is why I have always been open and receptive to hear the moral reasoning of others and have often enough adapted that reasoning as long as it was consistent, logical and didn't include assumptions I disagreed with (such as the infallibility of religious teaching).\n \n That is certainly better than having blind faith in the teachings of religious authorites that are just as fallible as anyone else. Indeed, in some ways, they are more fallible since they do not allow themselves to judge objectively. It is just ASSUMED that God passed down the laws without any evidence. \n \nAre you claiming empathy is a natural feeling built into us? Seems like that is an unreasoned, non-provable position.\n\n I have heard from psychologists that nearly everyone has a capability of empathy and the distinguishing point of psychopaths is that they are incapable of such empathy. I also have a lifetime of observation of people. Some people are more empathetic than others, and some need to be reminded of others suffering to feel the empathy, but all this says is that the capacity for empathy resides in nearly all of us.\n \nYou assume what you said to be true. I happen to disagree because you are essentially saying God is incompetent.\n\n I am not saying that God is incompetent. Assuming there is a God, I am saying that humans have shown themselves to be incompetent in often claiming divine inspiration for actions which nearly all would agree couldn't possibly have come from God. The suicide bombers of 9/11 certainly thought that their actions were divinely supported. Revelation is therefore a very unreliable thing. To think otherwise is very naive.",

   "I don't want to be killed because being killed would be painful, I would regret the loss of my physical life and, not knowing whether or not there is an afterlife, would face the emotional turmoil of realizing there could be nothingness in a matter of minutes. Others who knew and loved me would be caused suffering. Those are the first reasons that come to mind. These reasons are based on observations of myself and others - i.e. evidence. Evidence is all around me that nearly all methods of killing cause suffering. I have evidence from a lifetime of experience that physical pain without good purpose is a very bad experience for me that I would avoid at all costs. Evidence is all around me that my loved ones would miss me if I died - they miss me enough when I leave for extended periods of time. I could go on and on. My observations of myself and others (EVIDENCE) determine the basis of my moral beliefs.\n And? Why is suffering a thing to avoid? What is the rational reason for that?\n \n \nAs for not killing others because I do not want to be killed, there are two fold reasons for that. I already mentioned the first - empathy, which I, and apparently (from observation and the few passages I have heard from psychologists) most people possess the capability of having. The second reason is a type of moral consensus - a moral deal with the rest of humanity. I will treat you well if you treat me well. Most people seem to possess some level of reasoning along those lines - at least most people that I have ever heard discuss the subject. If I were thrust into a situation (such as wartime) where this moral consensus completely breaks down, then all I would really have left is empathy and the choice whether to keep to a one-sided consensus.\nSo you believe we have empathy instilled in us...That is a belief. It is also a belief that empathy is rational.\n \n\n Anyway, I have shown that my moral stance is based on a combination of observation (evidence) and reasoning based on that observation. \nAgain we both make \"observations\" the difference is your starting point which has no reason or rational basis behind it. Like I said in my first post we can go back and back and it will always end up \"well why ____\". \n \n \nI judge it against my observations of how various types of actions affect myself and others, and use reasoning from that point on. Of course, my reasoning can be flawed, which is why I have always been open and receptive to hear the moral reasoning of others and have often enough adapted that reasoning as long as it was consistent, logical and didn't include assumptions I disagreed with (such as the infallibility of religious teaching).\nA flawed reasoning may never be able to properly reason....nevertheless, you have yet to show how yours is reasoned other than from your own beliefs.\n \n \nThat is certainly better than having blind faith in the teachings of religious authorites that are just as fallible as anyone else. Indeed, in some ways, they are more fallible since they do not allow themselves to judge objectively. It is just ASSUMED that God passed down the laws without any evidence. \nBut it is blind faith. The fact that you aren't accountable to something doesn't make it any better or worse. You seem to think that you do not assume anything. You assume everything just as I have. The only difference is one starts on a position that an outside source made the rules and yours is based on rules made by yourself. You claim your \"rules\" came from a reasoning but that is impossible as I am talking about the very basic level of comparison here. For example, how you rationalize your ideas of empathy? You can't! You have faith in yourself and I have faith in a God. From that you have looked to yourself to answer questions regarding morality while I have looked to an outside code. The reason for looking to yourself has no rational reason just like looking to the outside doesn't. It is simply faith.\n \n \nI have heard from psychologists that nearly everyone has a capability of empathy and the distinguishing point of psychopaths is that they are incapable of such empathy. I also have a lifetime of observation of people. Some people are more empathetic than others, and some need to be reminded of others suffering to feel the empathy, but all this says is that the capacity for empathy resides in nearly all of us.\nYou have faith in them then. This still doesn't exactly say anything useful. Einstein believed in a God does that mean it is true or there is a rational reason for that? Perhaps a lifetime of observation has led me to believe in a God. Either point doesn't matter because if you state the observations made your basis then you have simply begged the question.\n \n \nI am not saying that God is incompetent. Assuming there is a God, I am saying that humans have shown themselves to be incompetent in often claiming divine inspiration for actions which nearly all would agree couldn't possibly have come from God. The suicide bombers of 9/11 certainly thought that their actions were divinely supported. Revelation is therefore a very unreliable thing. To think otherwise is very naive.\nTo say the Bible is at best worthless would be God is not capable of having a way for us to know Him. Seems that is fairly incompetent. For those that believe in the Christian God but say the Bible is flawed and therefore we don't have to follow some parts I say why follow any of it? Seems that is the most irrational line of thinking out of all of this talk. I'm not talking here about the folks that always bring up old testament law where they cherry pick quotes and say Christians aren't following God's word...I'm talking about people that say \"oh, I like to do xyz so therefore it must be ok and that part of the Bible is flawed....the Bible is really just about doing whatever I want and being happy with littles rainbows and bunnies\". This shows a lack of understanding and a misuse of religion. but this is another rant.",

   "And? Why is suffering a thing to avoid? What is the rational reason for that?\n\n Suffering without purpose is something that I personally find hard to tolerate, as do most others. It is an observation of my own reaction to things. Our instincts from evolution are to avoid un-necessary pain. As long as nobody presents a rational reason why I should take on such purposeless suffering then I will default back to my instincts - avoid suffering where you can.\n \n At some point, the core of the moral arguement is self-observation and observation of others. If you strip away all of the cultural or learned reactions to situations, then what one has left is the biologically driven reactions. I don't think one can disect things much finer than those biological reactions. They are what they are - that is how our bodies are constructed. There is no rationality to those biological reactions (except for the rationality dictated by Evolution). The cultural or learned reactions, on the other hand, do need to have some rationality to them since there are generally reasons why we behave differently than our biological impulses would tell us. Where suffering is concerned, nobody has as yet presented to me a reason why I should avoid the biological impulse of avoiding un-necessary suffering.\n \nSo you believe we have empathy instilled in us...That is a belief. It is also a belief that empathy is rational.\n\n The capacity for empathy being instilled in most of us is an OBSERVATION of trained psychologists, as well as my own observation from the limited sample of people I have met in my life. It is not a belief. Also, I did not say that empathy itself is rational (except perhaps in the Evolutionary sense that it helped us survive as a species). Empathy is something I automatically feel in many situations - it is built in. If someone were to present rational reasons why I should avoid my empathetic reaction, then I might change my mind. Nobody has presented such reasons.\n \nAgain we both make \"observations\" the difference is your starting point which has no reason or rational basis behind it. Like I said in my first post we can go back and back and it will always end up \"well why ____\". \n\n What \"observation\" do you make in your moral stance? Note that \"observation\", in this case, means a statement supported by experience. \n \n My observations are observations of my own reactions and the reactions of others, based on my own inner experience and the experience of seeing and hearing human interactions. At some point, one cannot disect things even farther. At least I try to disect things to their essence. You make no attempt at using reason in your moral stance at all. Your rules are never questioned. What rationality is there in that?\n \nA flawed reasoning may never be able to properly reason....nevertheless, you have yet to show how yours is reasoned other than from your own beliefs.\n\n Mine starts with observations of my reactions and those of others and uses reason from thereon in. The starting point is observation. \n \nBut it is blind faith. The fact that you aren't accountable to something doesn't make it any better or worse. You seem to think that you do not assume anything. You assume everything just as I have. The only difference is one starts on a position that an outside source made the rules and yours is based on rules made by yourself. You claim your \"rules\" came from a reasoning but that is impossible as I am talking about the very basic level of comparison here. For example, how you rationalize your ideas of empathy? You can't! You have faith in yourself and I have faith in a God. From that you have looked to yourself to answer questions regarding morality while I have looked to an outside code. The reason for looking to yourself has no rational reason just like looking to the outside doesn't. It is simply faith.\n\n The basis of my morality depends on looking at my own reactions and those of others - i.e. the evidence of observation. Your faith is based on assumptions (i.e. guesses) unsupported by experience. What specific assumptions do you claim that I make?\n \nYou have faith in them then. This still doesn't exactly say anything useful. Einstein believed in a God does that mean it is true or there is a rational reason for that? Perhaps a lifetime of observation has led me to believe in a God. Either point doesn't matter because if you state the observations made your basis then you have simply begged the question.\n\n It is not the individual psychologists I have faith in. I have faith in the time proven effectiveness of the scientific method and the scientific community which would ostracize any scientist who did shabby work. Einstein may have believed in God, but he never presented evidence for it. Psychologists present evidence - it is the evidence that I trust, when it comes from a source that is held accountable for that evidence. \n \n If you say that a lifetime of observation has led you to believe in God, then you might claim that your own reasoning has led you to that view. If you are open to others questioning that reason and if you are open to having your mind changed, as I am open to others questioning my reasoning, then your faith in God could be considered rational. However, what reasoning, I wonder, has led you to believe that the fallable humans that govern and governed your religion had it right - that the rules that they passed on really were from God?\n \nTo say the Bible is at best worthless would be God is not capable of having a way for us to know Him. Seems that is fairly incompetent. For those that believe in the Christian God but say the Bible is flawed and therefore we don't have to follow some parts I say why follow any of it?

This shows a lack of understanding and a misuse of religion. but this is another rant.\n\n Given how many versions of Christianity there are, not to mention that the majority of mankind is not Christian, it is clear that God, if he exists, is not being equally clear to all humanity. That would not seem rational either if one assumes a benevolent God that loves all humanity equally. \n \n The Bible is a document written by humans that may or may not have been inspired by God through revelation. Even if they were so instructed by God (a huge IF), then there are at least two things that could cause misunderstandings of the Bible:\n 1) They might not have understood the message from God correctly and therefore do not pass on correct information.\n 2) The message was so abstract that they had to describe it in metaphorical or symbolic terms to get their point across (this seems to be the view of many Biblical scholars - both secular and religious).",

   "I think I am going to have to come down on the side of Another Opinion so far in this one.\n \n A moral code should be built throughout life from once own experiences, whether religious or otherwise. The danger of relying on religious texts (okay non-religious texts can be pretty bad too), is that they are backed up by an all-powerful entity that cannot be contradicted. If it is believed to be the word of god, then however wrong it is morally, some will use it as a basis of their own moral philosophy (homosexual behaviour has already been cited). There is certainly no need for the input of a god in order to have a moral code. I have posted this story before, but here goes.\n \n \nDuring the Seventh Crusade, led by St. Louis, Yves le Breton reported how he once encountered an old woman who wandered down the street with a dish full of fire in her right hand and a bowl full of water in her left hand. Asked why she carried the two bowls, she answered that with the fire she would burn up Paradise until nothing remained of it, and with the water she would put out the fires of Hell until nothing remained of them: \"Because I want no one to do good in order to receive the reward of Paradise, or from fear of Hell; but solely out of love for God.\"\n\n \n The last line of this could just as well read, \"but solely because it is the right thing to do.\"\n \n And finally, one thing jumped out at me from the posts so far, with regards to Steeeeve's argument.\n \n \nOriginally Posted by Steeeeve \n The main point is, your code still works on some level of blind faith as you claim mine does. I freely admit mine is blind faith and I only wish others would admit to theirs as well. Just think of it as you can't prove anything you can only assume certain things and make calls based upon those very basic assumptions.\n\n \n \nOriginally Posted by Steeeeve \n I don't argue mine is blind faith. You don't seem to argue opposite other than to say \"no I don't\". For example, you say you don't want to kill others because you don't want to be killed. Well why don't you want to be killed? What is the rational reason behind that? Not only that, how do you get from no wanting to be killed to not killing. Their is not set of reason that draws that conclusion. \n\n \n It is possible that I have misinterpreted the bolded texts, but you appear to be contradicting yourself.\n \n Smiley",

My arguement was that the embryo cannot have a will to life so, therefore, your arguement was irrelevant for any stage of pregnancy where the fetus/embryo does not have that will to life. What counter-arguement are you presenting?",

   "So, the desire to \"not\" kill is a result of dogmatic or fascist ideology. hmmmm.\n Rational is defined as who creates acceptable parameters for life heh?\n\n I am curious about the logic which you used to come to this conclusion given my comments that your post was responding to - repeated below:\n \nYour mention of non-religious texs being able to be pretty bad as well led me to another line of thinking. Namely, non-religious ideologies that have been imposed on people throughout the ages are just as dogmatic and unyielding to reason as are many religions. The Communist ideology comes to mind, and Fascist ideologies. More close to home is the ideology that has been pushed recently that criticism of US actions abroad is unpatriotic. These ideologies all have in common a closure to public discussion, analysis and criticism. There is no accountability in these ideologies, as there is no accountability in religion. The truth of the ideologies (be they religious or secular) are assumed, despite evidence to the contrary. The evidence to the contrary does not engender any questioning of these \"truths\" but just engenders suspicion about the sources of that evidence. \n \n Anyway, I think that we should have the right to question everything that we are told. The truths which I generally accept are those which come from sources that present rational reasons and, importantly, are held accountable for their arguements.\n\n Here, I was presenting a range of secular ideologies which I also think are not held accountable for the truths they profess. I mentioned nothing about abortion nor did I intend to.\n \n ----------\n \n The desire to \"not\" kill is not a result of only dogmatic or fascist ideology. Most of us have a desire to not kill people - no matter what morality we espouse. However, there are at least two areas of variation between moralities that determine when it is ok to kill:\n \n 1) Whether or not it is ok to kill depends on one's moral stance about certain situations. For example, most would say that it is ok to kill during war - particularly killing someone who is trying to kill you. Some would say it is ok to kill the extremely violent and nasty criminals. The question of doctor assisted suicide, euthenasia, etc are also controversial. Most people would think it acceptable to kill as a last ditch effort in cases of self-defense against extreme violence. I could go on and on. \n \n 2) Different moral stances dictate what type of being is allowed to be killed. Vegetarians find the killing of animals so abhorent that they do not eat meat. Most people find no problem with killing food animals. Once a human body is brain dead and sustained alive only by machine, I believe that most people would unplug it - thereby causing its death. The great majority of people find no problem with killing human life in the form of a human egg with contraception.\n \n Where fetuses/embryos are concerned, both issues come into play. There are life forms that we cherish and whose life we protect in most situations. For many of us on the pro-choice side, the minimum for that consideration is that it be human and that it have at least a minimum mental existence. Otherwise, it is just an empty shell of a body (no mind) that only has the potential to someday become more. Once it gains that mental existence, then its life is as cherished as another life and one analyzes things based on the first criteria - for example, most of us accept that it is ok to kill the mentally-existing fetus if it is a big risk to the mother's life or health.\n \n My bottom line is that all of us, you included, do not purely and absolutely follow a prohibition against killing. Our view about killing depends on (1) circumstances and (2) what it is we would be killing. Our main differences lie in the details of those two criteria.",

In other words he postulates that the fetus acts to preserve itself because of the way it is constructed and because it is alive in the same sense as any brainless tissue is. \n\n His post, #21, doesn't seem to discuss the biological reaction to continue life. It seems to discuss the mental / emotional drive to live:The answer is in the plea of any murder victim who had the mental faculty or voice to develop the words \"please, don't kill me\". It is as simple as, respect my will to survive, I'll respect yours.\n This simplistic process is how the question relates to the act of abortion and why some can easily dismiss any feelings concerning the victim. It has no means of expressing it's \"will to survive\". Ever killed an earthworm? It curls up, hopes to avoid the pain of and the fatal contact, the same as a fetus or partially developed body of what would be a human that has no voice to plead, \"please don't kill me\".Words such as \"plee\", \"voice\" or lack thereof, \"will\" to live, etc. suggest that it is a mental desire which is discussed, not simply a biological reaction. That is what I was arguing against - namely, that there is no mental existence in the early fetus/embryo so there could be no will to life. His arguement seems to be one that appeals to our emotion of empathy. If there is no mental existence, then there is nothing for us to empathize with except a falsely imagined personality in that early fetus.\n \nThe real issue in abortion is whether the fetus has the status of personhood, not whether it is living tissue.

That also places personhood near the third trimester. Both ideas are consistent with biological realities. But are neither religious nor scientific but are rather matters of ethics.\n\n I generally agree with you that life begins at perception, though I would generalize it to any beginnings of a mental existence (perception might require consciousness, which I don't require for my view of personhood). I think that, for both of us, empathy drives much of our moral views so this position makes sense.\n \n The thing that continues to disturb me about the pro-life position is the pronouncement of such absolute laws without thinking about the basis to those laws. Moral laws need to have a rational basis. I certainly will not accept certain moral laws without a firm foundation of reason behind them. From that point of view, no pro-life advocate has ever presented a strong arguement about why the right to life of a single-celled zygote should take precedence over the rights of a woman to her own body. It just doesn't make sense to me and nearly all the answers I have gotten in response to this are simply pronouncements without any outline of the reasons behind those pronouncements.",

Killing it before it becomes a person is still a immoral, it may be expedient and/or legal but it is immoral.\n\n It is interesting to note that, for the great majority of the history of Christianity, abortion was not considered murder until the fetus was thought to gain a soul - usually thought of as happening at \"quickening\". It was not until the late 19th century / early 20th century that this was reversed to its current stance:\n \n from http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_hist.htm\n \nSt. Augustine (354-430 CE) reversed centuries of Christian teaching in Western Europe, and returned to the Aristotelian concept of \"delayed ensoulment.\" He wrote 7 that a human soul cannot live in an unformed body. Thus, early in pregnancy, an abortion is not murder because no soul is destroyed (or, more accurately, only a vegetable or animal soul is terminated). He wrote extensively on sexual matters, teaching that the original sin of Adam and Eve are passed to each successive generation through the pleasure generated during sexual intercourse. This passed into the church's canon law. Only abortion of a more fully developed \"fetus animatus\" (animated fetus) was punished as murder. \n ...\n Pope Pius IX reversed the stance of the Roman Catholic church once more. He dropped the distinction between the \"fetus animatus\" and \"fetus inanimatus\" in 1869. Canon law was revised in 1917 and 1983 and to refer simply to \"the fetus.\" The tolerant approach to abortion which had prevailed in the Roman Catholic Church for centuries ended. The church requires excommunication for abortions at any stage of pregnancy. This position has continued to the present time.\n\n So, though it was considered immoral to abort even before quickening, it was not considered murder. It is interesting that most pro-life supporters act as if their stance on abortion as murder is and always has been supported by their religion.",

Human beings can starve to death or be imprisoned before a cow can be used for food.\n \n I find this inhumane and immoral. Therefore, it could be said that MK Gandhi is correct in that their treatment of animals (cows, in this case) does indeed reflect on the moral progress (or lack thereof) in a nation.\n \n On the other hand, our mass slaughter of (pigs or chickens, for example), the inhumane manner in which we raise livestock, and our concomittant pollution of the planet in our lust for our American dinner meat, could be seen as the flip side of the same coin of immorality, reflecting on our own nation just as poorly as India.\n \n India's values reflect an idolatry of the cow; \"the sacred cow.\"\n \n Our mass slaughter reflect the darker side of American culture -- our selfish mouth stuffing with grotesque disregard for the lives of hundreds of thousands of livestock, environmental conditions, and the number of people around the world today (including our own country) who go to bed hungrey.\n \n By the same token, I see our cultural obsession with the abortion of zygotes and early term fetuses as a form of idolatry as well -- a form of valuation that sacrifices an understanding or valuation of real human lives and what is happening every day to them.\n \n Cow worship.\n \n Zygote worship.",

One side imposes themselves on the lives of people, would see women imprisoned for the destruction of a life whose value only God knows. (A Buddhist might consider it more criminal to step on an insect.) The other side, likely does contain some alienated neurotics, and those who are victims of a society that no longer cares for children anyway, so that it becomes too difficult for many of its people to have them.\n \n Either way, imposing one's view by law -- whether eating cows or aborting fetuses -- is ridiculous.\n \n This planet has enough to solve.

You seemed to say that it was ok morally to hurt someone if you were protecting yourself - where your life or limb would be in danger. From that point of view, a mother aborting for medical reasons was also allowable in your view. So, I extended the question to something that was more similar to what most women face with an unwanted pregnancy - a situation which is not absolutely necessary but which is very difficult in life to bear. You would likely find it very difficult to bear having all your possessions and your house stolen, would you not? Would you not at least consider hurting someone who would take away all your possessions against your will but who would not hurt you as long as you did not resist? If they were well connected in a way that let them get away with it, would you sit back and do nothing? \n \n Another point to address is that expediency is a relative term. It entails a pro/con analysis of the situation. For example, only a small percentage of people have a negative view of contraception so most people do not think twice about using it and just about any reason for using it is acceptable. For those people who do view contraception as the destroying of the potential of life, that is a big deal and one would have to have pretty sound reasons to use contraception. You view the abortion of first trimester embryos/fetuses as a very big deal so you would require very sound reasons to accept it (essentially, allowing abortion where the alternatives are very grave - as in risk of death, permanent injury, etc.). Most pro-choice proponents, including myself, do not view the negatives of first trimester abortion nearly as strongly. I would view a woman being forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy far worse than I would view the abortion of a first trimester embryo - mainly because the only negative I view in aborting a first trimester embryo is the stopping of potential (just a step further from stopping the potential of an unfertilized egg). \n \n From my own point of view, the pro/con balance in abortion rights starts weighing on the side of the fetus once it can have mental existence, around the beginning of the third trimester, since then there is a being that I can empathize with - empathize with the suffering, potential fear, pain, etc. that the fetus might go through if aborted.\n \n The pro/con analysis of abortion at various stages of pregnancy very much depends on what one values and why. I value women's rights to their bodies and the rights of mentally existing people. I place less value on potential.",

   "For example, on cow worship in India and agriculture, here's a wikipedia passage similar to what I remember reading:\n \n There is no consensus on whether the cow was sacred and forbidden in the Hindu diet from ancient Vedic times. The Vedic sacrifices, after which the sanctified meat was eaten, include bovines, and even at a funeral ceremony, the Ashvalayana Grhya Sutras prescribe the sacrifice of a cow for consumption. Frequently it is specified that the sacrificed cow had to be a barren one, \"destined for the gods and the brahmans\", or a bull. In their Dharmasutras, Vasishta, Gautama and Apastambha prohibit eating the flesh of both cows and draught oxen, while Baudhya-yana exacts penances for killing a cow, and stricter ones for a milk animal or draught ox. Starting with prohibitions on cow slaughter for ritual brahminical sacrifice, revulsion spread to the eating of all types of beef derived in such sacrifices.[1]\n It was possibly revered because the largely pastoral Vedic people and subsequent generations relied so heavily on the cow for dairy products, tilling of fields and cow dung as a source of fuel and a fertiliser that its status as a 'caretaker' led to identifying it as an almost maternal figure (so the term gau mata).  [underline added] Those who believe that Vedic people ate cows propose that the scriptural injuctions against eating it started with Krishna, who tended cows, or alternatively with the rise of Jainism.\n Despite the differences of opinion regarding the origins of the cow's elevated status, reverence for cows can be found throughout the religion's major texts.\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_cow",

   "There are two world views that there is no god or that there is a creater. if there is a creater murder is wrong (depends on what the creater says) but if you beleve in evoltion it is ok for murder. think about it evolution says there is no purpose for life and murder is right because we are nothing and its all right to kill people it is just helping mother earth out.\n\n \n \n How do you get to God= life is precious to No God = murder is good?\n \n With our intellect, reason, and empathy we don't (shouldn't) need the threat of punishment to do what's right and good. (And I'm not even going to get into the example your 'god' set in the bible with his multiple tantrums that nearly wiped out humanity or his torturing of Job on a bet from the Devil, how anyone can say that guy is 'good' is beyond me). Do you think the only thing stopping me (or anyone) from murdering people is the threat of punishment? \n \n Is the basic human instinct to help or hurt people? Here's a way to find out. Go ask strangers directions to a place that you know how to get to. If most of them give you correct directions, then we'll know most people do the right thing because it is just that, the right thing. \n Do you need everything spelled out for you, by a book? If god didn't specifically say \"thou shalt not give bum directions\" does that mean you will do it? Or do you choose to not send them in circles?\n \n The fact is, if there was a god, he didn't do a very good job training people to do right. It took the age of reason and a decline in the strength of the Church (esp. since it was one of the worst offenders) to allow mankind to set secular laws finally giving respect to the individual and individual rights and freedoms.\n \n BTW you are slipping again with respect to spell check.",
