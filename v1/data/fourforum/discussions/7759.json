   "Here's some quotes from the punditocracy immediately after capturing Baghdad.\n \n http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2842\n \n \n My favorite is Chris Mattews \n \n \"We're all neo-cons now.\"\n (MSNBC's Chris Matthews, 4/9/03)\n \n \n Anybody talking about military strikes against Iran, or outright war with Iran is living in the pre-Iraq war world. They have a pre-Iraq mentality. \n \n Iraq changed everything. \n \n \n Today a huge offensive is being launched around Samarra. FOR WHAT?\n \"To root out insurgents.\"\n The whole country is insurgents. The \"leaders\" of the country have already asked us to leave, repeatedly. So much for sovereignty. 80% of the public wants us to leave. 45% of the public thinks that attacks on US troops is justified. The whole country is insurgents. Who do you plan on \"rooting out\"? \n \n This huge offensive will accomplish nothing. Well, it will kill a lot of people and blow a lot of stuff up, but it won't kill any insurgency. If anything it will create more people willing to take up arms. \n \n Speaking of taking up arms, who are these Iraqis who are willing to fight alongside the army occupying their country and kill their countrymen? emoticon_confused Can you imagine an army occupying the US? Would you join them and kill Americans? Of course not. Would most Americans want to kill those people who did? Of course they would. \n \n Why is it after military people current and retired all said that this thing can't be won militarily, that it must be won politically first, are we trying so hard to find a military solution? :xbanghead",
