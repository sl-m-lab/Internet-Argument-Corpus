   "I defend creationists on this board because sometimes I see evolutionists make attacks on creationists that seem to be at least partially based on emotion. Richard Dawkins does admit that this is at least possible \n \n taken from Richard Dawkins \"Is science a religion?\" article.\n \"I want to return now to the charge that science is just a faith. The more extreme version of that charge - and one that I often encounter as both a scientist and a rationalist - is an accusation of zealotry and bigotry in scientists themselves as great as that found in religious people. Sometimes there may be a little bit of justice in this accusation; but as zealous bigots, we scientists are mere amateurs at the game. We're content to argue with those who disagree with us. We don't kill them.\" \n \n and personally in my circles anyway it is not that uncommon. People talk about the beauty of science and compare it to music and even though I agree I understand that these claims are not testable they are judgements that are based perspective.",

   "I don't think I've ever met an \"evolutionist\" as crazed with zeal as some creationists I've met. Some racists come close. There is one group of Nazis who have completely perverted the theory of evoluition to fit their degenerate racial ideas, in much the same way some creationists do the same thing to Christianity.",

   "I agree with Barbarian. In my short experience on these message boards (less than a year), in a zealotry contest the creationists tend to win this one hands down! Look at the examples of those who insist that there is a world-wide conspiracy in the scientific community to suppress the truth!\n \n But I should say that this is on an individual basis. There have been creationists that, although they insist that they know the \"truth', can maintain a pleasant and interesting conversation.\n \n And, sadly, Close_slave_can is also right in that there are too many people on the evolution side who are a little too quick to attack creationists when they start to argue. This is understandable, of course, since many creationists are repeating the same bad arguments that we have all heard a bazillion times, and we have just recently had an example of someone who would not listen to reason since \"all scientists are biased and cover up contrary evidence\" -- it is very easy to stereotype anyone who comes along and states something that sounds pro-creation. I am afraid that I have done that myself.",

I try to eliminate anything that might be offensive, and I try to be humble in my assertions. I've learned that the old saying \"you catch more flies with honey than vinegar\" is true. IMHO, nothing turns people off on these boards more than arrogance, especially if that arrogance is combined with sarcasm or name calling. Making suggestions, or pointing people in the right direction so they discover the facts for themselves is IMHO, far more effective in most cases than \"telling them how it is\" or why they're wrong. Don't underestimate the power of suggestion. ;) \n \n Patience, humility, and tact are probably the most important lessons I've learned (and am continuing to learn) from these boards. For an example of someone that I consider a role model in this regard, read any posts from Whistler.\n \n That being said, I do tend to fall off the wagon now and then. :p\n \n Waxy",
