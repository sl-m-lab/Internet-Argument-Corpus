Reuter said she would have been offended if asked to take the survey. \"I shouldn't have to answer that because it's private information,\" she said. Reuter said she was sympathetic to supporters of the survey who had hoped it would reduce harassment of homosexuals, but she thought the survey backfired.\n \n \"I think it just got people really, really mad,\" she said.\n \n Woelfel said he is still investigating the incident but would decide soon, along with the superintendent's office, whether the two teachers will be disciplined.",

This was not the right method to do it. The day of silence that happened a few weeks ago was a great way to raise awareness. I'm ok with people asking these questions verbally, but not in a school-sponsored survey, that's mixing ideology, sex, and beliefs way too much into school.\n\n \n The problem isn't with the survey, it was how it was administered. It isn't meant to be passed out en-mass, without explanation or context. The recipients should have the context expalined to them when they get it, and have it explained to them that the info isn't going to be collected or matched to them or anything like that. This isn't really a survey in the normal sense of the term, it's a thought exercise. It's meant to help people see things from a different point of view. When done properly it works very well. I've seen these questions presented several times before, and they've always generated useful discussion. But you do have to do it correctly; the questions don't stand on their own. That was the mistake that was made at this school.",

   "Until the needless suffering ends of young gays in school, this \"questionnaire\" is fair. No one has a \"silver bullet\" for ending homophobia in schools. How many of those that objected has really stopped to listen to the words of this minority? I really don't think people realize how devastating this problem is to them. Homophobia ruins peoples emotional health. Lives are ruined. Homophobia is rampent, especially in high school, and needs to be stopped. This \"questionnaire\" was only one tool, the intentions are good. The offense taken is towards their homophobia being questioned. Their views, and probably the views they were taught, exposed for how hurtful they really are.\n \n \n Here are some thoughts of young gays in school, these thoughts are common amoung young gays: \n \n http://www.queerday.com/2005/aug/11/homophobia_in_high_school_one_students_experience.html\n \n The Poem\n \n Bastards.\n Hating what they don't understand.\n Hypocrites all around.\n \n Prejudiced.\n Jeering, pointing, staring.\n The path goes down without a sound.\n \n Afraid.\n Threatened by anything different.\n Persecuting what they can't explain\n \n Biased.\n Crushing our self-esteem.\n Ignoring the pain.\n \n Sickening.\n Closing off minds to feelings.\n Nothing there but an empty shell.\n \n Burdening.\n Placing the weight of hate on our shoulders.\n Go to hell.\n \n Hurtful.\n Not caring.\n Every word ripping at our pride.\n \n Ignorant.\n Pretending not to see us.\n Pushing us aside.\n \n Heartless.\n Our souls don't matter.\n Words dripping with disgust\n \n Cold.\n We don't feel anymore.\n Numb with societies distrust. \n \n _____________________________________________________________\n \n \n http://www.gsanetwork.org/news/I1.html\n \n Who can live without love?\n \n - I love someone and I can't sleep at night because of it.\n \n - Over months I have shed countless tears.\n \n - My hope is to find somewhere I can be comfortable, not perfect, just supportive.\n \n - As soon as someone says something about anything XXXXX, 99% of high school kids freak, I thought knowledge was power, where is it? \n \n - Why is it that I can be called a XXXX in front of my class and all that is done by the teacher is she covers up her laugh with her hands?\n \n - My sister is a lesbian, my support is with her, at least she has me.\n \n - There is a fear of freedom.\n \n - I have struggled down this path, but I have met myself -- though I have scars wrapped around my heart that continue to bleed.\n \n - Hello, I am not a real valid person because I am bisexual.

   "Here is a 2005 study. \n \n Most everyone gets teased at one point or another. The harrassment of gay high schoolers or those perceived to be gay is relentless. This is much more than the normal emotional rollercoaster of getting through adolescence. Someone who didn't have to go through school gay or perceived gay wouldn't understand. No one with actual knowledge of the problem would ever equate the harrassment of gay students with the normal ups and downs of a teenager. \n \n \n http://www.glsen.org/cgi-bin/iowa/all/news/record/1927.html\n \n \n\"The 2005 National School Climate Survey reveals that anti-LGBT bullying and harassment remain commonplace in America's schools,\" said GLSEN Founder and Executive Director Kevin Jennings. \"On the positive side, it also makes clear that inclusive policies, supportive school staff and student clubs, like Gay-Straight Alliances, all relate to reduced harassment and higher achieving students.\" \n \n Key Findings of the 2005 National School Climate Survey include: \n \n \n The Scope of the Problem:\n \n 75. 4% of students heard derogatory remarks such as \"XXXXXX\" or \"XXXX\" frequently or often at school, and nearly nine out of ten (89.2%) reported hearing \"that's so gay\" or \"you're so gay\" - meaning stupid or worthless- frequently or often. \n \n Over a third (37.8%) of students experienced physical harassment at school on the basis of sexual orientation and more than a quarter (26.1%) on the basis of their gender expression. Nearly one-fifth (17.6%) of students had been physically assaulted because of their sexual orientation and over a tenth (11.8%) because of their gender expression. \n Academic Engagement, Aspirations and Achievement: \n \n \n LGBT students were five times more likely to report having skipped school in the last month because of safety concerns than the general population of students.\n \n LGBT students who experience more frequent physical harassment were more likely to report they did not plan to go to college. Overall, LGBT students were twice as likely as the general population of students to report they were not planning to pursue any post-secondary education. \n The average GPA for LGBT students who were frequently physically harassed was half a grade lower than that of LGBT students experiencing less harassment (2.6 versus 3.1).\n Positive Interventions and Support: \n \n \n The presence of supportive staff contributed to a range of positive indicators including greater sense of safety, fewer reports of missing days of school, and a higher incidence of planning to attend college. \n \n Students in schools with a GSA were less likely to feel unsafe, less likely to miss school, and more likely to feel like they belonged at their school than students in schools with no such clubs. \n \n Having a comprehensive policy was related to a lower incidence of hearing homophobic remarks and to lower rates of verbal harassment. Students at schools with inclusive policies also reported higher rates of intervention by school staff when homophobic remarks were made. \n \n Only nine states and the District of Columbia have comprehensive anti-bullying laws that specifically address bullying and harassment based on sexual orientation and only three of these laws mention gender identity. Nine other states have \"generic\" anti-bullying laws that do not specifically define \"bullying\" or enumerate categories of protected classes such as sexual orientation or gender identity. The remaining 32 states have no laws at all. The NSCS found that both states with \"generic\" anti-bullying laws and states with no law at all had equally high rates of verbal harassment. States with inclusive policies that specifically enumerate categories including sexual orientation and gender identity, however, have significantly lower rates of verbal harassment (31.6% vs. 40.8%). \n \n \"These reports from LGBT students echo recent reports from the larger population of students in the United States,\" said Joseph Kosciw, PhD, Research Director for GLSEN. \"In a recent national study conducted by GLSEN and Harris Interactive, 62.5% of secondary school students reported that other students were called names or harassed at their school on the basis of their actual or perceived sexual orientation, which was very similar to the 64.1% of LGBT students in the NSCS who reported experiencing such harassment.\" \n \n The National School Climate Survey is being released in coordination with GLSEN's 10th national Day of Silence(r) (www.dayofsilence.org ) where nearly 500,000 students from 4,000 secondary schools and colleges are expected to take part in activities to address the serious problems of anti-LGBT bullying and harassment, while advocating for solutions - like inclusive policies, GSAs and educator trainings - to ensure safe schools for ALL students. \n \n GLSEN's National School Climate Survey is the only national survey to document the experiences of students who identify as LGBT in America's secondary schools and has been conducted biennially since 1999. This year's survey includes responses from 1,732 LGBT students between the ages of 13 and 20 from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Data collection was conducted through community based groups and service organizations, from April to July 2005, and online from April to August 2005. The complete survey and additional information about methodology and demographics may be obtained by calling GLSEN's Communications Department at 212-727-0135 or by visiting www.glsen.org\n",

It creates alot of stress being harassed for something you know you have no hope of changing. Overweight people know they can lose weight, people who wear glasses can get contacts etc.. Based on my own personal observations, I see no parrallel between the harassment of gays and the harassment of other types. As school aged children mature, like from elementary to middle school to high school, I have seen harassment of over types get less and less while harassment of gays was never-ending and unchanging. Gays are not only rejected by their peers but also by their families in many cases. I saw a study that showed more than 84% of gays have experienced harassment and physical abuse. I really don't think there is any other group that reports such high statitics of abuse. (In current times).\n I am not trivilizing others harassment. It can be equally devastating.

I think we need to get away from this idea that anything that has to do with gays is a separate, more horrible thing in society than when those same things happen for other reasons. Harrassment is bad no matter what or who the target is. That's not minimizing what gays face; it's getting to bottom line of the matter and seeing the forest instead of just the trees.\n \n \nThe poster in question (who fashions himself \"pro-gay\"... go figure) routinely and reflexively attempts to diminish the significance of anti-gay abuse and discrimination (it's either \"rare\" and \"isolated,\" or overblown by \"gay rights activists\"), just as he always tries to minimize gay rights achievements (\"Big deal... gays can marry in only five, out of how many hundreds of countries?\") It's sophomorically transparent, of course, but he seems to think somebody's buying it.\n\n \n I don't even think I've said some of those things at all at about gays only getting to marry in 5 countries. I have said a long while back that gay attacks are rare and isolated, but others here convinced me they are more common than I thought. It's not been a \"routine\" of mine, nor has it been \"reflexive.\" I never said anything like that for the purpose of \"diminishing\" anything. But either way, at least the bulk of my posts consist of more than whining 3rd hand about other posters, or outright lying about them as you are doing.",

Harrassment is bad no matter what or who the target is. That's not minimizing what gays face; it's getting to bottom line of the matter and seeing the forest instead of just the trees.\n\n I think part of the problem that you HAVE to focus on GAY harassment, in addition to HARASSMENT in general, is that some parts of society are helping to VALIDATE the harassment.\n \n We CONTINUE to see the harassment not only in the schools, but also in our adult life. Whether it be verbal harassment, legal restriction of rights, or similar issues.\n \n If you ask a kid whether or not it is \"moral\" to tease a kid because he wears glasses, you'll more than likely get an honest \"no\", but they do it anyways. Much like people speeding on the freeway.\n \n But if you ask some kids whether or not it is \"moral\" to tease gay kids, some will answer YES because that is what they are taught. That is how they perceive society, and react accordingly.\n \n So the message of \"don't harass\" has different implications for the gay kid and for the kid who wears glasses.\n It's NOT JUST the harassment. Kids need to learn a lesson that a lot of adults haven't. They have to learn how to have their views, and still co-exist peacefully with others.\n \n \n And along another lines, if you have a society where robbery is high and rape is low, does it make any sense to just give a generalized speech to a community about how not to be a victim of crime \"in general\"?\n Or does it make more sense to give them a focused speech on how to protect themselves from robbery, while focus on rape isn't as necessary...\n \n Talk about NO harassment? Yes.\n But do that while leaving NO focus out on ANTI-GAY harassment, which has been demonstrated to be a more significant problem than generalized harassment? That doesn't make sense.",

   "Teaching black history helps to reduce harassment of blacks. \n\n \n \n It does? Do you have any proof of that? In the topic of black history month, it seems like it would be a slap in the face to blacks. It's almost saying, you're not important enough to be taught in the rest of history, so we're going to reserve one month out of the year to teach about blacks. I'm sure it would cause a fuss if a teacher decided to not teach about a black guy because it wasn't black history month. So why the special month for blacks? I agree, they should be included in textbooks too. But the way to become equal isn't to try to \"correct\" the problem and reward for past discrimination. It's like slavery reparations. We've been racist in the past, but now it's time to fight the racism. And making a special month just for one race doesn't help any to fight racism.\n \n But I'd actually like to hear from a black person on this. It would be interesting, although I'm sure there are some on both sides.",
