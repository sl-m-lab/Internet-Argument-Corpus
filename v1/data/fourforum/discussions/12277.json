   "Citigroup Fumbles Response to Questions About New $50 Million Jet -- Daily Intel -- New York News Blog -- New York Magazine\n \n \nCitigroup Fumbles Response to Questions About New $50 Million Jet\n \n Did Citigroup fire its public-relations department when it laid off those 50,000 people a few months ago? Among the many problems faced by the beleaguered bank is the fact that no one seems to be managing their image. There was the long Times takedown of the bank in November, which was only officially commented upon ex post facto. Then there was Riskmeister Emeritus Robert Rubin's disastrous defense of himself in The Wall Street Journal, and the long period of dilly-dallying over bonuses. And when, apparently, the Post called to ask the company to comment on their recent decision to purchase a new $50 million jet, a Citi employee responded like a petulant child.\n \n \"Why should I help you when what you write will be used to the detriment of our company?\" replied Bill McNamee, head of CitiFlight Inc., the subsidiary that manages Citigroup's corporate fleet, when asked to comment about the new 7X.\n \n \n \"What relevance does it have but to hurt my company?\"\n\n \n Ok, so this article is more about the way they screwed up the PR portion of this, but it was more entertaining than the \"CITI buying $50 million jet with taxpayer money\" story. \n \n Citibank is broke...they have to beg for public bailouts...but not so broke thet they cannot afford a new $50 million toy.\n \n Yea. Thank god we are going to be paying interest on THAT $50 million for the next hundred years!!!",

This idiocy where we respond to economic weakness by reducing taxes and increasing spending has got to stop. Already some pretty sizable cracks are appearing in the market for us treasuries and they have sold less than 3% if what they are going to have to move this year to support the idiotic spending that has already taken place. \n \n \nBTW, Citi ordered the jet 2 years ago before this current grease fire started...and they have decided to cancel the purchase.

Sounds good to me. \n \n If we end up nationalizing banks, it is going to be because they keep doing stupid stuff like this. The XXXXXX running these places need to wake up and realize that when you are begging money from the public you do not buy new jets, you do not throw half million dollar corporate retreats, you do not send your executives off to Europe on hunting trips, you do not hand out massive bonuses to the folks who ran your business into the ground.",

   "Are we being fooled?\n \n Pandit Says Citigroup Having Best Quarter Since 2007\n Pandit Says Citigroup Having Best Quarter Since 2007 (Update2) - Bloomberg.com\n \n \n March 10 (Bloomberg) -- Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit said his bank is having the best quarter since 2007, when it last posted a profit. The shares rose as much as 27 percent and helped spur gains for finance company stocks.\n \n \"I am most encouraged with the strength of our business so far in 2009,\" Pandit wrote in an internal memorandum obtained today by Bloomberg. \"In fact, we are profitable through the first two months of 2009 and are having our best quarter-to-date performance since the third quarter of 2007.\" \n\n \n I wonder if this is a result of Citi Bank removing its troubled assets to a \"non-core\" unit as posted by me in January. \n \n Citigroup moves towards break-up\n FT.com / Companies / Banks - Citigroup moves towards break-up\n \n \nCitigroup is to break itself up by separating higher risk US consumer finance and securities businesses from its global commercial banking operations in an attempt to ensure its survival.\n \n People close to the situation said Citi would place unwanted assets and businesses worth more than $600bn - a third of its balance sheet - into a \"non-core\" unit to isolate them from healthier parts of the company.\n \n Bankers said the new unit would remain on the company's books but its results would be reported separately from the rest of the business in an effort to convince investors of the company's viability. The non-core unit could be eventually sold in parts or as a whole or spun off once market conditions improved, they added.\n\n \n I'm not sure about this because it is hard to figure out what Citi ever does. I'd be happy to hear from some experts (Daewoo) on what is really going on here. Something doesn't add up.",

I'd be happy to hear from some experts (Daewoo) on what is really going on here. Something doesn't add up.\n\n \n Citi has already converted $25 billion in preferred shares into common stock since the beginning of the year. They are converting another $36 billion (us government) this month and another $15 billion (saudis) before the end of the quarter. The average fixed dividend on those preferred shares was 12%. That is 8.64 billion in savings they are going to book this quarter (despite the fact that in reality they are yearly savings). \n \n What they are converting is senior preferred shares with a par value assigned and, in the case of those owned by the US government and the Saudis, a requirement to buy them back. By converting those to common equity they do away with those obligations. I am not sure how that impacts their accounting since it is such a bizarre arrangement (when is a loan not a loan.....) \n \n I will tell you right now...companies leak memos when they want to move the market without being charged with fraud. I find it INCREDIBLY difficult to believe that they have gone from needing billions in bailouts to being profitable all at once. It was in THIS QUARTER that they struck the deal with the treasury to convert their preferred shares. If things are actually as bright as he makes on in the memo, somebody needs to drag Geithner down to the capital building and have him explain why we are putting taxpayer money at risk to bail out an institution that is apparently in GREAT shape. \n \n My guess would be that something nasty is coming up involving Citi and they are trying to give their stock a little boost before it comes up. Memos like that do not get leaked unless they are meant to be leaked.",
