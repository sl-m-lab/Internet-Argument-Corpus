   "Other Parents Want Gay Couple's Kids Out of School\n \n Monday, January 03, 2005\n \n \n \n COSTA MESA, Calif. - Some parents and parishioners have accused the Roman Catholic diocese in Orange County of violating church doctrine by allowing a gay couple to enroll their children in a church school.\n \n The group demanded that St. John the Baptist School (search) in Costa Mesa accept only families that pledge to abide by Catholic teachings, the Los Angeles Times reported in Sunday's editions. Church doctrine opposes gay relationships and adoption by same-sex couples.\n \n \"The teachings of the church seem to have been abandoned,\" John R. Nixon told the Times. \"We send our children to a Catholic school because we expect and demand that the teachings of our church will be adhered to.\"\n \n School officials rejected the demand, and issued a new policy stating that a family's background \"does not constitute an absolute obstacle to enrollment in the school.\"\n \n The parents' demand would presumably prevent two adopted boys whose parents are both men from attending the school's kindergarten.\n \n The Rev. Gerald M. Horan, superintendent of diocese schools, said that if Catholic beliefs were strictly adhered to, then children whose parents divorced, used birth control or married outside the church would also have to be banned.\n \n \"This is the quagmire that the parents' position represents,\" he said. \"It's a slippery slope to go down.\"\n \n The boys' parents, who enrolled their children at the beginning of the school year, declined to comment to the Times.\n \n Some parents have promised to ask the Vatican (search) to intervene and some have threatened to pull their children from the school. Others are worried the boys' attendance will set a precedent, saying their presence is part of a larger effort by the gay community to change the church.\n \n \"The boys are being used as pawns by these men to further their agenda,\" said Monica Sii, who has four children at the school\n\n \n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,143140,00.html\n \n I don't think that having the children of gay parents in a Catholic school is a dangerous precedent. What is the \"agenda\"? How are two boys in kindergarten furthuring it? \n \n Do you think the other parents have a good case?",

   "I think the possibility that the gay parents are Chrsitian has escaped notice. There certainly are plenty of gay Chrsitians; there are even plenty of Christian churches which accept homosexuality. Let us not also forget that although we classify these parents as \"gay parents\", they are people too, and homosexuality is only one aspect of their life and personality. They may believe that it is worthwhile to expose their children to a potentially homophobic environment if it means their children will learn about God and other morality. They may consider themselves Christians first, loving parents second, and gay people 143rd.\n \n What I mean is that being gay does not mandate any specific set of beliefs, and for many people it is an extremely minor aspect of their lives. Do any straight parents use their sexual orientation to determine where they send their children to school? Probably not; and I'd imagine most gay parents do not do that either.",

I can remember as early as kindergarten discussing such important topics of what we have vs. what they have, and even guessing about how the equipment worked. You may want to hide the facts of life from your children like some parents do, but I think it is more important for children to be educated with the facts instead of locker room myths and guesses. It is never too early to start learning anything...especially the fact that their are ignorant bigots out there who would hold the relationship of 2 consenting adults over the heads of little children, and make the children suffer to spite the parents out of moral condemnation.

   "Yes, I knew Snake was being a bit silly, I just thought it a good opportunity to expand upon my previous point.\n \n Most people who tell me that they are gay do so after a long process of testing me to determine whether I'll be accepting of it or not, or because they know I will be accepting because I met them in a gay rights organization or some other accepting atmosphere. I would imagine that most people who tell you they are gay do so because they realize that you disagree with same-sex marriage and they wish to defend their rights.\n \n You must understand that because of these differences, you only have experience knowing gay people in the situation where they are defending gay rights. It is understandable why this would make you think that gay people care about nothing but their sexuality, but in truth their sexuality extends only as far as a heterosexual's in most cases. Even if you do come across a homosexual who is outspoken about his or her orientation, the reason for this is usually only because they are denied rights, they are treated badly because of their sexual orientation, or because someone has mistakenly assumed that they are heterosexual. It is not because they consider it the most important aspect of their lives.\n \n So try, for the moment, to understand that your view of a homosexual is only a small piece of who that person is; they are not as different from the next person as you seem to believe.",

She works for a religiously run healthcare organization as a financial officer. She also is a parent to my son. These are only some of what we do and who we are. \n \n Being gay is only a fraction of who we are. But the fact that being gay denies us equal protections in our everyday lives is of issue. I am the voice of those issues in our family. \n \n \n What you said before kind of sparked an analogy in my mind.
