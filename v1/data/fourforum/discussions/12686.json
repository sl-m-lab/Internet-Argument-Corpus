   "I think it's safe to say that Republican activists and officials have been pretty harsh in their criticism of President Obama and the Democratic majority in Congress. But a group of Republican National Committee members claims that GOP Chairman Michael Steele hasn't gone far enough.\n \n Twenty-three RNC members - including two from Oregon and one from Washington - are sponsoring a resolution that puts the Republican Party on record charging that the Democratic Party is \"dedicated to restructuring American society along socialist ideals.\"\n \n The resolution further calls on Democrats to \"rename themselves the Democratic Socialist Party.\"\n \n Steele is resisting the resolution and there's been a lot of debate in the blogosphere about whether this Republican faction is pushing their party into name-calling that will only alienate average voters.\n\n GOP fights over labeling Democrats as Socialists - Jeff Mapes on Politics\n \n Glad to see that the RNC is concerned over the IMPORTANT policy decisions.\n For a minute there, I thought they were indifferent to people who were losing their jobs... emoticon_rolleyes",
