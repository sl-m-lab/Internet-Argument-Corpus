   "I thought I would quickly ask this, but I may go to a computer forum if I don't get a quick answer.\n \n Does anyone know if a Do laptop encryption programs like ZoneAlarm Datalock, really protect the data and files on your laptop from a thief being able to access the data and use it for id thief or put it on the web for all to download?\n \n I am traveling more, and if my laptop gets stolen, I don't want my data to be readable. ZoneAlarms Datalock laptop data encryption software seems to be what I want.\n \n It does a pre-boot authentication with a password. This seems to be a general deterrent for non-technical users, correct? \n \n Is this pre-boot feature important?",
