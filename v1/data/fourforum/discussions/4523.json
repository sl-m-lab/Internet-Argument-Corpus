   "This could be look at in 2 ways\n \n 1. A million dollars a year gays pay that they shouldn't have to or that they are taken advantage of. \n \n 2. A loss for the state of Ct in tax revenues.\n \n Important clip from article:\n Sen. Andrew McDonald, a Stamford Democrat and co-chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said the lost revenue proves the inequities gays and lesbians now face.\n \n \"Under current law, (same-sex) partners are at a real economic disadvantage because they are considered to be legal strangers - they're no more connected than if you left a bequest to your neighbor down the street,\" McDonald said. \"To me that underscores very real economic discrimination.\"\n \n The loss of tax revenue is \"the price we will pay to end this legal discrimination,\" McDonald said. \n http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/03/031305connCost.htm",

   "I don't know Joe. I know the gist of the story was positive. but I hate to see people even considering whether gay marriage or civil unions should fly, or not, based on how much money the state could lose. Cheapens the whole thing. No one considers that for straight unions. How about gay unions should fly because two people love each other, want to commit themselves to each other for life, and it's the right thing to do.",
