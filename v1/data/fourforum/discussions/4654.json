   "If you want the real truth about some of these \"taxation is illegal\" arguments, I suggest The Truth About Frivolous Tax Arguments. Brushaber actually demonstrated the exact opposite of what is claimed here.\n \nThe Sixteenth Amendment provides that Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes on income, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration. U.S. Const. amend. XVI. The Sixteenth Amendment was ratified by forty states, including Ohio, and issued by proclamation in 1913. Shortly thereafter, two other states also ratified the Amendment. Under Article V of the Constitution, only three-fourths of the states are needed to ratify an Amendment. There were enough states ratifying the Sixteenth Amendment even without Ohio to complete the number needed for ratification. Furthermore, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the income tax laws enacted subsequent to ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in Brushaber v. Union Pacific R.R., 240 U.S. 1 (1916). Since that time, the courts have consistently upheld the constitutionality of the federal income tax.\n\n \nMiller v. United States, 868 F.2d 236, 241 (7 th Cir. 1989) (per curiam) - the court stated, \"We find it hard to understand why the long and unbroken line of cases upholding the constitutionality of the sixteenth amendment generally, Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Company . . . and those specifically rejecting the argument advanced in The Law That Never Was, have not persuaded Miller and his compatriots to seek a more effective forum for airing their attack on the federal income tax structure.\" The court imposed sanctions on them for having advanced a \"patently frivolous\" position.\n\n I also recommend Perfectly Legal both for general interest regarding tax abuse, and specifically in this context for the chapter on people who use these sorts of arguments for not paying taxes at all. In my opinion, tax-court settlements for pennies on the dollar owed should be made illegal, and \"tax protesters\" whose arguments are deemed frivolous should be shipped permanently to a small island where they won't get to enjoy the benefits that others' taxes pay for. Their children should be placed in foster care, lest they be made to pay for their parents' lack of morality.",

   "I have no argument with the 16th amendment and the legality of the income tax. I have strong objections to a tax code so complex and voluminous that I must pay a few hundred dollars each year to have the various schedules and forms completed. For decades I have listened to politicians speak of \"Tax Reform\" only to see the volume of the tax codes increase. This has produced a tax industry in this country. It seems to me that this goes way beyond \"lay and collect taxes\".\n Dono",
