Hillary Rodham Clinton and Illinois Sen. Barack Obama are locked in a tight race for the Democratic nomination in which Michigan and Florida could give either candidate a decisive boost. As it stands now, the Democratic Party has disqualified the results in those two states because they violated party rules by holding elections early in the campaign season. \n \n Clinton won both states and wants the results added to her tally. Obama&#8217;s campaign argues that such an outcome amounts to changing the rules late in the game, saying it would shatter the party. \n \n One alternative mentioned by the Florida Democratic Party is a vote-by-mail election. Under this scenario, ballots would be mailed to all of Florida&#8217;s approximately 4.7 million registered Democrats in May or June. The cost would be $4 million to $6 million, and the state party would want to be reimbursed, a party official said Thursday. \n \n The Florida Democratic Party would be open to accepting a &#8220;soft-money&#8221; contribution from, say, a wealthy Democratic donor, labor union or other source to underwrite the cost, the official said. Also, Florida Democrats would want commitments from the Obama and Clinton camps that the two candidates would campaign in the state. \n \n Karen L. Thurman, the Florida Democratic Party chairwoman, said the party is hashing out alternatives with representatives of the Clinton and Obama campaigns as well as the Democratic National Committee. \n \n &#8220;We have discussed many things, ranging from the plans for the general election to a potential alternative primary,&#8221; Thurman said. \n \n One possibility that the state&#8217;s Republican governor, Charlie Crist, said he would not support is another full-scale primary underwritten by Florida taxpayers. A Crist spokesman said that the price tag would be $25 million and that the state would not be willing to pay it. \n \n Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., sent a letter to Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean on Thursday suggesting that Florida hold another primary, with the national party underwriting the costs. \n \n Nelson, who has endorsed Clinton, said he would support a new primary election but not a caucus. Clinton tends to struggle in states that hold caucuses while faring better in primaries. \n \n Dean said Thursday that he would like to see Florida and Michigan hold new nominating contests. But he said the national party would not pick up the tab. \n \n Each state has two options, Dean said. One is to come back to the Democratic National Committee with a new delegate selection plan that complies with party rules. The other is to appeal to a 186-member credentials committee at the August convention to allow the Michigan and Florida delegates who were chosen in the early primaries to be seated. \n \n With no consensus in sight, some officials said it&#8217;s time to convene a committee of party elders. \n \n Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II, DMo., said he was so worried about Democratic infighting over the election that he is urging Dean to appoint a panel of party elders to recommend a strategy for resolving the Florida and Michigan disputes. \n \n Members might include former President Jimmy Carter and former Vice Presidents Walter F. Mondale and Al Gore. \n \n Cleaver is a Clinton supporter, but he said it is important for the campaigns to &#8220;turn down the volume.&#8221; \n \n &#8220;If we keep going the way we are, we might as well give the keys to the White House&#8221; to the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, he said.\n\n \n \n Now let me get this straight. The GOP MUST abide by the law tooth-and-nail, but the Dems can move the goalposts??",

   "I'm not surprised one bit. In Sept. Hillary was perfectly happy with 'disenfranchising' the voters in MI and FL, when she thought she didn't need them. Now that she's getting her clock cleaned, she's fighting for their rights. She's the only one who left her name on the ballot in MI and the only one who made 'trips' to Fl (although she says they weren't campaign stops!).\n Obviously, she's willing to do or say anything to get into power. What I don't understand is how her supporters, seeing this behavior and, what I would call, untrustworthiness can really believe that they 'know' her. I'm far from being an Obama supporter, but, with him, you see that he's playing by the rules and believes what he says. Hillary time and time again says whatever she thinks people want to hear.

The one that so alienated everyone she came into contact with over her health care plan that her own party destroyed it. The one that publicly and loudly defended Bill and arranged for attacks on Monica Lewinsky when she knew the complete and sordid truth. \n \n \n She's always had a chip on her shoulder and a strange paranoia, but it's definitely gotten worse. Now it's not just the vast right wing conspiracy that is out to get her. Now it's the mainstream media. How are they doing that? By asking her the first questions at the debates! \n \n \n Hillary's snide comment about whether Barack needed a pillow to be made more comfortable was downright embarrassing. The anticipated applause line on her script never happened. The audience was silent. The press was amazed. And Barack seemed genuinely startled by her nuttiness - he looked over at her as if he was viewing a dotty old aunt at a family dinner, the one that everyone politely humors. \n \n \n Her lifelong pattern of secrecy was once again evident. While publicly promoting transparency in government, she steadfastly refuses to release her personal income tax returns. That's a clear tip-off that there's something to hide. Recall that the Clintons selectively released tax returns in Arkansas, but refused to go back to 1980, when Hillary had her windfall in cattle futures. \n \n \n During the debate, Hillary suggested that she'd release the returns \"soon,\" but her staff quickly backtracked. She implied that she's been too busy to deal with releasing the returns. Does she really think anyone believes that it will take more than simply making a copy of the return? She's stalling and there's a reason for that. \n \n \n Most likely, the return will show how much Bill has been making from his partnership with the Sheik of Dubai and his other business ventures. Should the spouse of a presidential candidate be in business with a foreign leader who needs favors from the U.S. government? Definitely not. That's why we'll never see those returns. \n \n \n And then there are the Clinton Library records that document her schedule as first lady. She doesn't want them released either because they will definitively show that she was never the co-president. The Library has been stalling on the release of those documents for years. During the debate, she said that she wanted them released as quickly as possible and seemed to blame the Bush administration for the delay. But today, the White House indicated that she had made no requests for any expedited release. \n \n \n The old Hillary, the real Hillary, is back. \n \n \n And there's apparently been no one to stop her from acting on her own worse instincts. \n \n \n Underneath the veneer of the practiced smile and the strategically used giggle, there is a rage that is always close to the surface. It was on display in the debate. \n \n \n Hillary Clinton is furious that America has not agreed to her coronation. She doesn't understand why voters are rejecting her and embracing Barack Obama. She just doesn't get it. \n \n \n Never one to engage in self reflection, she can't blame herself or even her incompetent strategists and advisers. They're too close to her. She can't accept the sorry fact that her campaign has been a disaster because it was based on the past and not the future, because it was premised on her phony experience and maintaining the status quo, and because her negative outlook is completely out of step with the mood of America. And finally, because in the positive message of Barack Obama, Americans see a stark contrast with her doom and gloom view of the world. \n \n \n So, she'll blame the media. It's their fault. \n \n \n And she'll keep screaming about what a fighter she is. \n \n \n More like a bully.",

Plus the huge amount of corporate money she's getting undermines claims that she'll tax business to death. Jim made a badly thought out argument about how Hillary was a Communist without actually understanding Communism. Businesses do not donate to people who will deliberately destroy them. IMO, Hillary is just saying that to get votes. And increasing the security net is not necessarily a bad thing if it is cheaper then the alternatives.
