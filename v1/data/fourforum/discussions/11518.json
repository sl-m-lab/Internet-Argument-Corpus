   "I'm not quite so certain, because I see gleeful threads like this one started about a softening of Christian doctrine much more often than I see scientific types starting threads about cooking. \n\n Stick on the subject.\n This thread has nothing to do with \"scientists wanting to modernize\" religion. This is about a religion recognizing it cannot credibly deny scientific facts. \n \n \n \nThen there are those in science who seek to end religion that seem to have it as a goal to discourage people from \"living by the letter of their relgious texts\". \n (from the above link - question to Sam Harris)\n Seems to be important to one who \"seeks to end religion\", wouldn't you say? \n\n Indeed, Sam Harris thinks religion is a bad thing, in part because it can encourage primitive and nonsensical thinking, as this may be dangerous to our existence. But again, this has nothing to do with your assertion that scientists or science per se want to change religion. \n \n \n \nThere is also the possibility that scientific facts can sometimes be watered down to make them more attractive to atheists. \n \n \n Anything is possible. This, however, is simply untrue. Can you please name a single instance in which this is the case?",

   "You constantly prove how dishonest or ignorant you are kronus. And let's not forget that famous kronus hypocrisy that your name represents so consistently around here. Note the bolded in the posts below. I was speaking to the processes of abiogenesis and evolution. Now anyone need do is follow the flow of the attacks you proceed to make and it's very obvious that you're purposely attempting to distort what I said. \n \n \nNo, but abiogenesis does, and they are 2 sides of the same coin as they are presented as one process following the other. It is so deceptive and disingenuous to constantly separate them as unique processes while all the time knowing that one study is the scientific continuation where the other ends. You are playing a game of semantics in order to claim they aren't connected while all the while knowing that one study directly and specifically follows the other and build upon its claims as it continues on the explanation of how life evolved from single celled life forms. So stop with the denial and word games and face the truth for once in your life.\n\n \n \nI know I'm presenting facts to Archie, sorry...\n \n Archie, in point of fact you have it backwards. The theory of evolution was first, then abioegenesis.\n\n \n \nAgain you distort the facts in order to support your warped perspective.

If you can't explain your ideas clearly it isn't my fault.

I knew better, I went ahead anyway, and tada!\n\n \n This whole post proves that it is you who is either exactly what you're attempting to accuse me of being, or worse, you're just a blatant liar by attempting to purposely misinterpret what I have said here because I perfectly explained myself clearly and concisely.
