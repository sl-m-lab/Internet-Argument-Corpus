   "Just saw this on another forum and thought it was pretty interesting.\n \n On February 24, 1987 the light from the explosion of the blue supergiant star Sanduleak -69\u00b0 202a (spectral class B3) reached the earth and was observed by Ian Shelton and Oscar Duhalde at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, Albert Jones in New Zealand, and Colin Henshaw in Zimbabwe.\n \n In addition to the visible-light discovery of the supernova some twenty-four neutrinos and anti-neutrinos above background were detected at three instruments (The Kamiokande II in Japan, the IMB Detector in Ohio and the Baksan 5 detector in the Caucasus of the former Soviet Union) over a period of some 13 seconds beginning at 7:35am, February 23, 1987, Coordinated Universal Time. The neutrinos from the explosion arrived at earth before the visible light did because the shock wave from the core collapse had to reach the surface of the star before any unusual visible light could be emitted. The precise timing of the detection of the neutrinos lets us know exactly when SN1987A exploded from an earth-bound point of view.\n \n SN1987A, because it is relatively close to the earth, is the most observed supernova in history. Shortly after its explosion, it was observed using the Russian-built Astron II orbiting ultraviolet telescope, which gathered light-curve data indicating it was a type II-P core-collapse supernova. However, some of the most dramatic images of the supernova had to wait for the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope in April of 1990. When Hubble came online and its Faint Object camera was turned on SN1987A on August 23 and 24 the circumstellar ring around the supernova remnant was revealed in all its glory.\n \n http://www2.egr.uh.edu/~cwilkin3/Supernova-1987a.jpg\n \n \n The ring, which is a result of the impact of the light, especially UV, from the explosion on ejecta from the progenitor star's stellar wind was first observed approximately eight months after the explosion. This has been confirmed by later observations that show the brightness of the ring follows, but lags by about eight months, the variations in the brightness of the supernova remnant. This means the radius of the ring is approximately eight light-months, or two-thirds of a light-year.\n \n The exquisite resolution of the images from Hubble's Wide Field Planetary Camera has allowed observers to measure the angular radius of the ring at 808+-17 milli-arcseconds. Applying basic trigonometry, we get the distance to SN1987A as:\n \n http://www2.egr.uh.edu/~cwilkin3/SN1987a.jpg\n \n \n So there it is. The death knell of young-earth creationism without resort to radiometric dating, redshift or anything more advanced than high-school math. The universe is at least 168,000 years old because it took the light from SN1987A 168,000 years to get here.",
