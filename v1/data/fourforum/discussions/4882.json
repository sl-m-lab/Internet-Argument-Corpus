   "You Bush haters crack me up\n\n \n Analyzation: Avoid discussing and label someone a bush hater. Insults work better then actual facts in VOR's opinion. \n \n \nHave you noticed that there was and election in Iraq?\n\n \n Yes, does it mean anything? No. The Sunnis are still relatively in the cold. The government is lead by a Iranian fundementalist. The majority party endorsed by Sistani still cannot reach agreement on its issues and is set to tear itself apart. The Kurds are moving to create a new state. Not to mention that they could litterally undue every single freedom created by the provisional government in the next consitution which is set to take hold in less thena year. Besides, elections and practical democracy, not to mention stability are very different things. \n \n \nThat attacks on Americans are way down\n\n \n Small hit and runs yes. \n Large, complex, car bombs that take dozens of lives in a single blast are up. Along with suicide bombings in general. Which is worse: a thousand attacks which kill 15 soldiers, or two car bombs which kill 40 and 100 civilians? \n \n \n\n That American casualties have dropped\n\n \n Yes, because we have retreated to fortified bases and let the iraqis handle a job they are not able to do. \n \n \nThat the Talaban no longer run Afghanistan\n\n \n Yes, now warlords run the north, the Taliban run the south, and Opium is about the be the country's #1 export. \n \n \nThat a free and democratic gov. has been elected there......That Syria is leaving Lebanon\n\n \n How is that related? \n \n \nThat Libya has given up their nukes\n\n \n Libya had no nukes. Libya also offered during the 1990s to give up their programs. Also, Libya did not give its weapons to the US, they gave the program to the British, who sidelined the US in the negioations. \n Not to mention when we account for 20 years of embargos and the rising oil prices, no idiot is going to stay under trade embargos when there are billions to be made. \n \n \n\n That women will vote in Saudi Arabia for the first time\n\n \n How is that related? They planned that before Bush. \n \n \n\n All of these successes were born by President Bush's foreign policy\n\n \n Considering two are unrelated, a third was due to LACK of US policy, and the other are questionable themselves, you have alot to explain.\n \n Let's deal with the reality of Bush's foreign policy. \n \n Afghanistan is still not under NATO control. It is set to release a huge drug crop upon the world. Not to mention that fighters are still comming from Pakistan, and Bin Landen and Omar are as yet uncaptured. \n \n Iraq is now a terror state. Where Iraq was previously a secular dictatorship, it has turned into the death ground for over 1000 us troops. We have got what we wanted to prevent: a terrorist state. How is that successful?\n \n Then we have North Korea. We are likely going to BRIBE them to stop their nulcear program, and no plans for military action are even on the table. Bush has sent a clear message: Get a nuke and we won't bother you. \n \n How is a foregin policy that stresses nuclear politferation GOOD?",

Where? We have removed a pro-western, secular government and installed in its place a government run by Islamic fundamentalists. The new prime minister is the head of the IRANIAN funded Dawa party. The attacks on Americans are way down because we have withdrawn to heavily fortified bases. We have traded US soldiers lives for the lives of Iraqi civilians, despite arguments by he military that it is BETTER to kill off US soldiers than to kill of local civilians (a hard learned lesson from the Vietnam era).\n \n The taliban now only runs about 40% of Afghanistan. The warlords run the rest, except for about 10% of the country, which the government runs....during the day. \n \n Syria leaving Lebanon has nothing to do with the US. It is the result of the assassination of a popular political figure. Whether it will be a good thing or not is yet to be seen. Sheesh, I would have thought that the Iraqi elections, with bush supporters jumping up and down like XXXXXX yelling \"We told you so\", only to look like complete jackasses when he final election results were tallied, and it became apparent that we had essentially turned Iraq into a fundamentalist stronghold, would have taught you people something about jumping the gun when it comes to patting yourself On the back. \n \n Libya has given up their nuclear program, which they have essentially been begging to do in return for trade concessions since the 80s. At the same time, Syria has announced that there is no way they are giving up theirs. The VERY SAME week that the US passed sanctions against Syria, the EU signed a trade deal with them. The VERY SAME week that bush got up and said \"We will not allow Syria to have a nuclear program\", the russians announced that they had just sent the first load of reactor parts to syria, and that they were not going to stop regardless of the US position ont he matter. The VRY SAME DAY that condi rice got up and said \"An Iranian nuclear program is unacceptable\", a spokesman from the EU announced that Iran WILL be keeping their nuclear program, with voluntary inspections by the IAEA.\n \n These are the results of the Bush administrations foreign policy. The US has NO credibility left, and has been rendered irrelevant by the rest fo the world. After seeign what it cost us to take over a weasly little nothing ocputnry like Iraq, nations that have any teeth at all are no longer afraid of US military intervention. The otehr day condi went into a speil about the iranian terrorism links, and it simply doesn't matter. There is not another nation on the planet willing to back any play we make on that since the Iraqi terrorism links turned out to be a load of BS. In fact, in response to condis comments, an EU spokesman said \"The EU will continue trade negotiations with Iran\"",

This seems to be your MO.\n \n You can support the troops, who through no fault of their own, and most definitely through no choice of their own, have been sent to Iraq, without supporting the reasoning behind their being sent there.\n \n The average soldier, simply carrying out their duty, regardless of their personal feelings on the issue, is not to blame for the war, the blame rests with the Bush administration and the senior military officials.\n \n In that sense I can fully support them in their daily endeavors to carry out a mission that is not of their control, but more importantly, in their daily endeavors to stay alive and be able to return home to their countries and their families. \n \n Your assertion to the contrary is a false dichotomy.\n \n Waxy\n\n \n So are you saying you support the troops but hope their mission fails? emoticon_confused If there mission fails and they lose to insurgents that means Americn deaths and casualties.........",

   "About those attacks\n \n \nJust when military commanders in Iraq were beginning to feel optimistic about the marked fall in the number of terrorist incidents and attacks in the wake of the January elections, the insurgents twice so far this month have staged well planned and coordinated mass attacks on U.S. facilities at Abu Ghraib prison and a Marine base on the Syrian border.\n \n In the case of the remote and isolated Marine base at Husaybah, the insurgents massed a force estimated to number more than 100 men and distracted the defenders with mortar and rocket-propelled grenade attacks as a dump truck loaded with explosives blew apart a roadblock at the entrance to the base. \n\n \n http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=2270&ncid=2270&e=2&u=/krwashbureau/20050420/ts_krwashbureau/_bc_galloway_column_wa_1",

Eddie asked for reliable numbers, not vague speculation.\n \n You confirmed the $1,500 figure I posted, but then dismiss it as 'case specific.' You argue the figure applies only to gunmen who would not ordinarily join the insurgency.\n \n But you likewise noted that Iraqis who would not ordinarily join the police and military are doing so because 'there are no other jobs.' Hence you reveal a double standard in arguing that Shia gunmen hired by the insurgency are case specific, while Shia gunmen hired by the government are not.\n \n CvT's statement was plain and simple - 'the terrorists pay much better.' When faced with evidence that the Sunni insurgency pays $1,500 monthly - roughly six times more than the government pay scale - you try to embellish his statement with speculative appearances. CvT's statement stands as is, not as you wish it to appear.\n \n Given specific numbers that the insurgency does pay better, you shift focus to the 'insurgency as a whole,' even using bold type to emphasize your preference to compare apples and oranges, to compare those who are ideologically driven with those who merely have no other job. But even then, you remain unable (or unwilling) to offer any pay scale numbers to consider, which was Eddie's point.

The vast amounts of cash at stake are indicated in the U.S. military's recovery of at least four separate hauls of metal boxes, roughly 200 so far, each containing $4M. Those boxes alone amount to nearly a billion dollars.\n \n To pretend that none of the billions Saddam skimmed from the UN program is helping to fund the insurgency is perhaps the height of naivete on this subject.",

Though Duelfer's fruitless search for WMD's ended last year, his investigation did show that illicit proceeds of the scandal made their way into the bank account of a terrorist organization.\n \n In view of such documented and growing evidence, I submit that 'idle speculation' more aptly describes your own state of thinking that investigators cannot discern any origins of insurgency funding due to 'the way money is moved in the ME.'\n \n Considering your presumed familiarity with how money moves in the region, please enlighten readers with your knowledge of how bankers and front companies, couriers and money-launderers still network together to handle Saddam's billions of dollars in oil-for-food kickbacks. The vast amounts of cash at stake are indicated in the U.S. military's recovery of at least four separate hauls of metal boxes, roughly 200 so far, each containing $4M. Those boxes alone amount to nearly a billion dollars.\n \n To pretend that none of the billions Saddam skimmed from the UN program is helping to fund the insurgency is perhaps the height of naivete on this subject.\n\n \n Ah, gator the administration cheerleader is back.\n \n The sliding pay scale is old news, used long before the current situation in Iraq and continued to this day. If you have a good horse, ride it. I thought anyone interested in those numbers could do a simple google. Here's a recent commission structure:\n \n http://iraqthemodel.blogspot.com/2005/03/al-iraqiya-tv-exposes-terror-cells.html\n \n http://www.voanews.com/english/2005-04-04-voa6.cfm\n \n There are lots of those wandering around, their validity and others including a set monthly stipend need to be tempered with the amount of persuasion associated with so-called confessions.\n \n I did not dispute oil for food money had been and is being used, I said that to state any money from any source is speculation unless one happens to be the source. The time proven successful process of laundering money has been to mix it with clean money. Who's to say what ends up in Iraq is the dirty or clean portion? By the time most money reaches the hand of anyone involved in that resistance some of it has passed through respected ME money changers even the new democratic government of Iraq would never give up. The Hundi and Hawala underworlds alone can easily move millions daily without bothering their other activity. \n \n What's the issue on where the money comes from? And who cares? Or is this just another belated attempt to refocus the public on our folly and rebrand it, again, as humanitarian? When blended in with other available sources, it's still money, nothing else. \n \n TAP is still desired by the participating nations, the problem being that no contractor is willing to even consider construction until 'minor' security problems within the new democracy are resolved. Do we have a projection for that within this century?",

   "You want to argue a point, yet you have no facts to show. You finally admit to guessing. Eddie asked for reliable numbers, not vague speculation.\n\n \n At, but Cvt is guessing as well. \n \n \n\n You confirmed the $1,500 figure I posted, but then dismiss it as 'case specific.' You argue the figure applies only to gunmen who would not ordinarily join the insurgency.\n\n \n Because there is no evidence that it applied to the rest of the general populace for hire. Not to mention that Shiaa would have a higher price to fire on their own kind, rather then paying a Sunni to fire on a group different from their own. It is much cheaper to hire a ethnic group to go kill a group historically opposed to them then to hire a ethnic group to go kill their own. \n \n \n\n But you likewise noted that Iraqis who would not ordinarily join the police and military are doing so because 'there are no other jobs.' Hence you reveal a double standard in arguing that Shia gunmen hired by the insurgency are case specific, while Shia gunmen hired by the government are not.\n\n \n How so? You assume that such payments are out there for everyone. That has yet to be assumed. You are guessing yourself while you chastise others for the same behavior. That is by all means hypocritical. \n \n \n\n CvT's statement was plain and simple - 'the terrorists pay much better.' When faced with evidence that the Sunni insurgency pays $1,500 monthly - roughly six times more than the government pay scale - you try to embellish his statement with speculative appearances. CvT's statement stands as is, not as you wish it to appear.\n\n \n I never said his statement was false. \n \n \n\n Given specific numbers that the insurgency does pay better, you shift focus to the 'insurgency as a whole,' even using bold type to emphasize your preference to compare apples and oranges,\n\n \n How is that apples and oragnges? There is no proof that such payments are being made to other member sof the insurgency. As such until proof is given, the $1,500 payment is case specific. You are falsely assuming that the payments run evenly across everyone yey provide no evidence to back your own claim up. \n \n \nto compare those who are ideologically driven with those who merely have no other job. But even then, you remain unable (or unwilling) to offer any pay scale numbers to consider, which was Eddie's point.\n\n \n because I don't have such numbers. I do have logic though. \n \n \nThus, despite your shift in focus, that glaring omission deprives your argument of power of persuasion.\n\n \n Considering that you are attacking me for something you just did yourself, that deprives your argument of power of persuasion",

   "No Mr. Reason, I live in the real world---the one that does not contain 10-second sounbite mentality and highly emotionally charged issues intended to deviate attention from the stupidity of your claims.\n \n \"Over-exaggerated\" is what I wrote, or do you conveniantly miss reading certain words on purpose? I got a Brother, a Brother-in-law, an Uncle, and every single guy I knew in the service that served in Veitnam----I never met a one who was spit on or called \"Babykiller\". Infact, most came home to quiet but respectful homecomings, and that was the government's fault for making it a 13 month \"individual\" tour. They did not get their parade, they did not get the glory they deserved, but to make like the spitting on soldiers, Babby killer thing was the norm is just 100% Bull.\n \n It happened, but just like you seeing combat, it did not happen to you, of this I am almost 100% completely sure. I am a member of the VFW you Bozo, and guess what, none of my VFW Post Buddies have ever been spit on either. I am not sure about the quality of any organization that would afford you a membership, nor do I believe you and they way your friends think is universal.\n\n \n You must belong to the John Kerry and \"Hanoi Jane\" branch of the VFW.......... :) That explains it all when it comes to you.............",

   "He flew those pieces of garbage for about 40 whole hours out the 68 hours of active duty service he gave us in repayment for his flight training. He was commissioned as an officer 5-weeks into his Basic traing at lackland AFB. You ever know anyone who got that kind if special treatment? He Unilaterally chose to Disobey a Lawful Order by refusing to take a flight physical, therfore grounding himself! Yep, I wish my Military Career had been so demanding.\n \n I have a high amount of animosity that is directed at this President, I cannot, and will not deny that. However, I would feel this way about any President who misled the Nation to get us into a region for Geopolitical purposes at the expense of American troop's lives. Good intentions are not a justification, and all I can say is if you do not feel this way----close your eyes, imagine The United States in the same situation it is right now---only this time imagine the President's last name is Gore or Clinton. Blow Jobs don't get people killed unless the jealous husband has a gun.\n \n You find it strange that they would hate people who build them schools etc. Well, that's because you do not have the same paradigm as they do. They see us as occupiers.\n \n Everything you describe as what did not happen in Vietnam, did happen in Vietnam, but on a different scale. What do you think the TET Offensive was?\n \n 25 Year Old, Horras Mohammed Amin was one of the injured who survived yesterday's blast that killed approximately 60 people at the recruiting station in the Kurdish City of Irbil. While in Hospital, the injured recruit was standing near the end of the line when the explosion occured. \"I wanted to find a job because it is very shameful for a young man like me to take money from his Father,\" he said. It's called being stuck between a rock & hard place.\n \n Like the Vietnamese, the insurgents just keep coming---it's worse now than in June of 2003, and, many of these guys and gals are willing to commit suicide in the name of their cause. They believe they are fighting for their Freedom and a better future. It just depends on what side your on as to how you are persived by the other. It's about world views and culture---something our American Hubruois does not seem to be able to allow our minds to wrap around.\n\n \n Lets face it your just one of those Vietnam anti war protestors who are bitter because the hero that sleaze bag Kerry did not get elected president................Just another Bush hater, no more no less.........",

   "When I come across lapses in logic I can't help replying.\n \n \n\n Do you hate all presidents, or just this one? I don't recall Abraham Lincoln leading the charge at Antietam, but maybe I missed it.\n \n I've run into quite a few hardcore military folks and not a one of them has ever said that they thought the president should be on deployment.\n \n That's not his job. It's part of the whole \"military governed by civilian government\" thing.\n \n If you want to live in a country where the army runs the show, things generally aren't all that great. Liberia was governed by a mutinous sergeant major for a while.\n \n I'll take a civilian, thank you.\n\n \n Ok, first you start saying that the civilian prez doesn't go to battle because the army is commanded by civilians. Then you go off into something about Michael Doe. ???\n \n \n \nAs for what grudges the Iraqis will or will not harbor, I find it strange that they would hate the people buildilng them schools and hospitals and fighting for their freedom and love the ones blowing up all that stuff.\n\n Aren't the ones trying to build schools the ones that blew them up?\n Aren't the ones that blew everything up the ones in charge now?\n Were the soldiers fighting for the freedom of Iraqis or to further American interests?\n \n \n \nPeople keep bringing up Vietnam, well, did the VC run around killing everyone and everything? Did they set off bombs in crowded shopping areas and hold whole villages hostage? Maybe they did, but it seems to me that you've got this whole guerrilla war thing backwards: ******* off 80-90 percent of the country by killing them is no way to win hearts and minds.\n\n ???\n \n \n\n Like the Vietnamese, they don't care how many of them you kill - they're fighting for something they consider more important than life itself. They're fighting for freedom and a better future.\n\n Funny, that's what the Vietcong were fighting for and the insurgents in Iraq are currently fighting for: \"freedom.\"\n \n Actually, everyone is fighting for something bigger than themselves.\n No side just wants to kill people for the sake of killing.\n All sides have their agendas, which are always \"bigger\" than the individuals.\n \n \nOf all the causes to die for, that's up near the top.\n\n I see you agree with the 9/11 terrorists.",

I assume you haven't actually listened to what Bin Laden said in any of the tapes but of course you don't actually want to hear the other side of the story. I do think that we should hunt him down but that doesn't mean they aren't fighting for their freedom. Back up these claims of them having no interest in freedom. I'll assume your \"brain damaged cretins\" was an exageration and not literal. They want their freedom and we want ours.
