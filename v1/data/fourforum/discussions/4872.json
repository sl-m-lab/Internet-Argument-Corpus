   "Pope John Paul II's predecessor has been named. Pope Benedict XVI is german and was forced into the Hitler Youth at 14, he rarely attended. He served in the Nazi military for two years, but deserted just days before the surrender of Germany. He was a professor of theology in the early 1960's at various universities. Some issues he has took a stand on are euthanasia, abortion, homosexuality and relativism; all of which he opposes.\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Cardinal_Ratzinger\n \n Just some news, which I thought should be posted in the \"news\" forum.\n (I also heard that an african american cardinal was second choice, not that I have any sources to back that up)",

   "It's interesting you should mention that. Yes, to my knowledge a goodly percentage of catholics are of some sort of latin-american descent, but I don't think many are cardinals. This is merely speculation of course, as I haven't researched at all. But I believe very few, if any, latin-american popes have existed; also, I believe, rarely are there latin-american cardinals. It's very strange...\n \n I will look into this.",
