   "This is surely the way to raise an psycho child out of what would have been a great child.....\n \n Is My Child Becoming Homosexual?\n \n That's the sub-title of Focus on the Family's web page entitled,http://www.focusonyourchild.com/develop/art1/A0000684.html The page goes on to offer a checklist of telltale signs to watch out for in determining a child's (in this case, a young boy's) developing sexuality:\n \n 1. A strong feeling that they are \"different\" from other boys.\n \n 2. A tendency to cry easily, be less athletic, and dislike the roughhousing that other boys enjoy.\n \n 3. A persistent preference to play female roles in make-believe play.\n \n 4. A strong preference to spend time in the company of girls and participate in their games and other pastimes.\n \n 5. A susceptibility to be bullied by other boys, who may tease them unmercifully and call them \"queer,\" \"***\" and \"gay.\"\n \n 6. A tendency to walk, talk, dress and even \"think\" effeminately.\n \n 7. A repeatedly stated desire to be - or insistence that he is - a girl.\n \n Interestingly, the page also points parents who suspect that their child might be gay to a listing of http://www.focusonyourchild.com/develop/art1/A0000690.html \n \n What's interesting about that (in my view) is that this is the first time I've seen ex-gay Reparative Therapy aimed squarely at young children whose sexual development is still incomplete. It seems the idea of diagnosing pre-homosexual tendencies in young children is gaining traction. The thinking, I presume, is that \"curing\" kids of homosexuality is easier if the condition is caught and treated early. This fits logically with the \"homosexuality as treatable disease\" idea in vogue with the Religious Right.\n \n This idea actually would make a lot of sense--if homosexuality were in fact a disease that could be cured through therapy.\n \n I'm one of the few people I know who began ex-gay reparative therapy to cure my homosexuality while I was still a young teenager--before I'd actually had sex. In my own experience, trying to \"treat the condition early\" made no difference that I can tell. But I'm curious to hear from others of you out there who may have similar development timelines...\n \n Did any of you XGW readers experience ex-gay intervention as a child or adolescent? If so, what are your thoughts on this idea of marketing ex-gay therapy to the parents of very young kids?\n \n http://www.exgaywatch.com/blog/index.html",

   "Well, the site seems to focus on \"gender confusion\" more than anything. \n \n I guess the thing that bothers me about that is that it seems to assume boys and girls should take on different types of behavior in all cases. The problem with this thinking is that there are plenty of effiminite men out there who are absolutely not gay. Am I right in saying that effiminite and butch are behaviors that are really not related to being straight or gay? I gues what I'm saying is that if my son were effiminite, I would never assume that meant he would be gay. \n \n Another issue is that people have different views about what consitutes effiminite behavior. For that matter, all of the behaviors listed there are pretty subjective when it comes to what they mean. For instance, #2 is a tendency to cry easily or be less athletic. That's crazy--some kids just don't like athletics as much. And regarding the crying, maybe they are simply more sensitive than other kids or they could have other issues. It has nothing to do with being gay or straight. For that matter, as an adult I'm pretty artsy myself--a musician, I enjoy sketching, and I'm not much of an athlete. But there is no doubt I'm not gay.\n \n I have to agree with you all here that whoever wrote this article has a poor grasp of reality.\n \n There are many things that Dobson's group writes that are highly regarded--he's very good in teaching about responsible parenting and giving attention to children and dealing with emotions at various ages. But if this article is the view of Dobson, I have to disagree with he and the author on it.",

If so allow me to explain Matthew 19:12 in another manner.\n \n It is evident that Christ was going to tell them something that would be impossible to understand outside the realm of His Spirit. He knew that before He said it, but it had to be said. And notice that He is not addressing a crowd, but His disciples. According to that site Christ was referring to homosexuals, but take a closer look. He said, \"All cannot accept what I am about to say except those to whom it is given.\" (verse 11). ...whom it is given. in this instance and others throughout His teachings, means through the Holy Spirit.\n To believe in the Bible, one must believe that there was once another earth-age, billions of years ago. That age was the last of the beings that lived here, destroyed due to a war between Lucifer and God, where Lucifer and his cohorts tried to kill God and take His place. Those spirits and souls now inhabit this earth-age, in human bodies, our bodies. Some are born to live an unmarried life due to the fact that they are already married to the Lamb, or Christ because they chose to side with God billions of our years ago. Some, after they are grown, are forced to be eunuchs by worldly things, and others do so of their own free will so that they can further the Kingdom.\n He was trying to get his disciples to understand the difference between worldly and spiritual things. In their desire to learn about marriage, He gave them the spiritual term and how that applies to this age - hence his statement. \"If you can accept it, accept it.\"\n \n One must also realize that the term \"eunuch\" can have several meanings, including castrated men, court officials, shamans, sages, and wise men depending on the subject matter.",

   "There is biblical and historical documents which present a strong argument that there were different types of Eunuchs in the ancient world. Some people who lived during ancient times described Eunuchs as being effeminate. There is also historical evidence describing how Eunuchs were sexually active with men. Eunuchs only became identified as castrated men after the 4th century A.D. The ancients also distinguished between born Eunuchs(Eunuchs with complete genitals) and castrated Eunuchs. Homosexuals also were not called men by the ancients and some societies created three gender categories. Therefore, Bible passages about homosexuality was only intended for heterosexual people to follow. Homosexuals(Eunuchs) were not considered males. Some societies called homosexual men, \"half-males.\" Please visit http://www.well.com/user/aquarius/thesis.htm The site also provide evidence about lesbian women as well.",

But back to the original point there is a secular purpose for marriage (or else it should be removed from government and be a purely religious ceremony), so unless you can prove that making it 2 of the same gender instead of 2 people of opposite genders will undermine that secular purpose you have no basis for denying them marriage any more than I do because your screen name starts with b.

Most of the other existing sodomy statutes did not specifically target \"homosexual acts\" but were clearly discriminatory based on application. Only g/l/b/t people were prosecuted under those statues. Also, in many of those cases, those statutes were used to infer illegal activities by otherwise law abiding citizens.
