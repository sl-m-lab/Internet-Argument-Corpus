Single shots have been in service since the very beginning of the American military, either in flint, percussion of metallic cartridge configuration. The lever action, while never officially adopted, was used widely by scouts since the 1860s. The bolt action was adopted as the military rifle of the 1890s and remained that way for many decades, when finally replaced by the semi-automatic in the 1930s.\n \n Every firearm used for hunting and regarded as a \"hunting gun\" has had its ties with military weapons development.\n \n \nIf you want to hunt pigs with handguns then by all means. If you want to hunt deer with a AK-47 I'd wonder why?\n\n \n I can get technical on the matter, explaining how the SKS, AK-47, Saiga, Winchester 94 and Marlin 336 are are comparable in power on a shot-by-shot basis, how their ballistics are similar and there's hardly a distinction between them.
