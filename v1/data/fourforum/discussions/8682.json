I would hazard a guess that both you and jim have not been DIRECTLY affected by either terrorism, or the Iraq war. Your lives, like mine, have likely continued on at the status quo, other than your gas costing a little more.\n \n Now imagine that you live in destitute poverty. Your wife and daughter have been killed by bombs, they've taken your property, and told you how you're going to be governed and by whom (sure, you get to vote, but you had no say in the system itself, or who you get to vote for). You don't even have a gun, let alone a stealth bomber like your enemy has, what's your course of action? Do you do nothing? Do you simply accept what's happened to you and thank the people that killed your family and gave you the right to vote? Or do you look to some other course of action? I know I sure as hell wouldn't sit around and do nothing.\n \n First off, and let me make this VERY clear - I DO NOT SUPPORT ACTS OF TERRORISM.\n \n That being said, does not mean that I can't understand the desperation that leads to these acts. Nor can I definitely say that I wouldn't consider such acts myself if the shoe were on the other foot. You don't fight the most powerful army in the world by lining up in a field and doing battle WWI style, that would be idiotic. You fight using the means you have available and that are most effective - guerilla warfare.\n \n The problem is, we haven't really presented any other alternatives to the situation.\n \n This has nothing to do with the Stockholm syndrome, and everything to do with trying to understand the real cause of the violence, and put an end to it. If the US, and the entire western world, isn't willing to take a look in the mirror first and get our house in order, how can we expect the rest of the world to follow suit? Other than \"killing them all\", what can I do, what can we do as nations, that will put an end to the violence? Undoubtedly there will be those that simply will not accept any solution, but IMHO, the majority can be dealt with reasonably, they aren't terrorists now, they need to be driven to that level of desperation. There is a new generation whose minds need to captured before they fall into the same pattern. We are doing NOTHING to address this problem.\n \n Waxy",

They do not care if their own children are killed.\n\n \n And the irony is that for those who don't really research and look into the situation before making a judgement, Israel is the one condemned for those civilian deaths, when in fact it's Hezbollah that is essentially using them for the human shields. It's the same problem the anti-Iraqi war movement has when they condemn the US for civilian casualties when in fact the insurgency puposefully uses the population as human shields by hiding among them. So the problem is the mostly uneducated (on the issue) public who doesn't really look into matters carefully before making assumptions.\n \n As far as Waxy's views on needing to get to the roots of what ultimately leads to terrorism, I agree with him--whether it's the taking of land, or poverty, or whatever.",

This festered into terrorism on their part long before this century. Their drives to conquer the world and convert all peoples began hundreds of years ago. The Catholics whipped them back lest they destroy the entire Christian world.\n \n Somebody else needs to do that today.\n \n The only way to stop the Islamo-facists from killing people is to kill them.\n \n They do not think like you do. They will not consider compromise and peaceful coexistence. They want you to convert or die.\n \n If you kill enough of them off, the violence will subside for years. It will rear its head again in the future and we'll need to kill them off again. That is the only effective way to fight with people who want to live in the 5th century.\n \n The sooner we are rid of them, the sooner we can expect a relatively peaceful world.",

I call B.S.\n \n I will agree that there is a core community of hard core radical muslims, I strongly disagree regarding their numbers, and the general cultural acceptance of their extremism.\n \n These radical communities survive by converting more regular Joe muslims into radical ones. It requires indoctrination to convert people into extremists. It's far from a fallacy, it's the ONLY way they can survive and maintain their numbers. \n \n \nNot only is it expensive and slow, it will not work. It is not a viable solution. It does nothing to reduce the number of radical Muslims. (because they WILL NOT LISTEN TO YOU OR ANYBODY ELSE WHO TRIES TO CONVINCE THEM THEY ARE WRONG!)\n\n \n That's your unsupported opinion, you'll forgive me if I don't grant it much credence.\n \n The current radicals don't need to be converted or convinced, we need to focus on those that are not yet radicals, and prevent them from becoming radicals. If you cut off the source of more radical muslims, eventually, their numbers will dwindle, as the numbers dwindle, so does their influence, and the effect snowballs.\n \n \nHistory shows that the Catholics did a good job when they killed thousands of them...on more than one occasion. There was relative peace (as opposed to masses of radical Muslims conquering and slaying country after country) for a long time after the crusades.\n\n \n That's your one sided Christian viewpoint of the Crusades, MANY do not share your viewpoint, myself included.\n \n \nNow you sound like another poster who claims he shouldn't have to prove what he claims. It's not left to me to verify what you say. You should do that yourself, especially when you make claims involving numbers.\n\n \n If common sense and the ability to reasonably observe the world around you is beyond your scope of abilities, then there's precious little I can do.\n \n \nConjecture and speculation such as that will kill us all. The \"war on terror\" (war against radical Muslims) has resulted in the capture and killing of several leaders, their right-hand men, their laptops (with valuable info) and recently resulted in stopping a plan to kill hundreds of people by blowing up several packed airliners.\n\n \n And yet, the attacks are still being planned, the terrorist groups are as strong as ever, and we are no more secure than we were before. If you truly believe otherwise, IMHO, you're either terribly naive or a fool.\n \n \nI do also. That's why the recent plot was discovered...some good Muslims came forward and helped prevent a catastrophe. They would however, never have talked the bad guys out of doing their deed. We had to arrest them.\n\n \n They don't need to \"talk them out of it\". That's utterly ridiculous. They simply demonstrated that they don't support the actions of these radicals, and turned them over to the appropriate authorities. That's EXACLTY how it's supposed to work. If we could work toward getting all muslims to approach the extremists in this manner, the problem would quickly solve itself.\n \n \nMy question to you was not identical to your question to me. You gave me a choice involving who should die. I gave you a choice between converting and being killed on the spot. That is the choice you are being offered by the radical Muslims....convert or die. Which do you prefer? (Neither is not an acceptable answer here.)\n \n Just imagine that a radical Muslim is in your face with his sword poised to behead you. Are you going to convert or try to kill him? If you say you're going to convert, there's no sense in my talking to you about this topic.\n\n \n Rest assured, I would fight back.\n \n The problem is, you just don't seem to get it. It's not a legitimate question, especially as originally posed, because the selection of answers is not representative of the complete range of options available.\n \n Just imagine you're trapped in a dark alley by a pink unicorn and the boogeyman, would you rather be raped by the pink unicorn, or eaten alive by the boogeyman?\n \n You can answer, but the answer is meaningless, as it has no bearing on reality, and leaves out countless other approaches to the situation that are available to you.\n \n \nYou should be concerned. That's the small radical minority that blows up airplanes, busses, wedding parties, etc. and whose main goal is to kill as many \"infidels\" (including you) as they can. This is the small radical minority that I want to KILL!! The rest of the Muslims and all the non-violent protestors in the world can exist side by side without killing others. \n\n \n I realize that this small minority of muslims is out there, I also realize that I have a far greater chance of dying in a car crash or being struck by lightning than I do of dying in a terrorist attack perpretrated by radical muslims.\n \n While it is a situation that needs to be taken seriously and dealt with, there's more than one way to skin a cat.\n \n \nWhile my methods (death to the terrorists) may be similar to those of Osama and his band of goats, my goal is to stop the terrorism by killing the terrorists. His goal is to kill peace-loving peoples who do not agree with radical Islam. There's quite a difference there.\n\n \n I'll check on this, but I don't believe that Osama has ever directly stated that Al Qaeda's goal is specifically to convert all \"infidels\" to islam. I suspect that's a figment of your imagination.\n \n \nYou don't know how much faith I have in mankind. I have faith that eventually mankind will absorb enough of this untenable XXXX from the radical Muslims and will rise up together to kill them all so that we who enjoy peace and productive interaction among nations can have both.\n \n I don't want to get into more religious attachments to this argument, but you can rest assured that my God is not a frickin' wimp. My God will strike dead those who deserve it.\n\n \n So you're an Old Testament kinda guy then....\n \n None of that love thy neighbor as thyself, turn the other cheek, and so on nonsense that Jesus preached.......\n \n Waxy",

   "What you're describing as idiocy to expect (other than the bullseye or sign hyperbole) are basic ethical rules of war, set down by the Geneva Convention. No, I don't think that's unreasonable to expect at all.

You're trapped in the Civil War or WWI \"nobility of war\" mindset. Newsflash for you - guerilla warfare and the tactics used by both sides in this war are not new, nor are they solely the domain of the \"terrorists\".\n \n I don't think you really want to get into a Geneva convention debate, as the US has more than few glaring warts on it's record.\n \n \nyes, of course it has crossed my mind; I've weighed the situaton a lot. But Israel went to enormous lengths to alert the Lebanese population that they needed to find shelter and move out of there. It's not like they didn't give them ample warning. All Hezbollah had to do was give up their kidnapped prisoners, and it would have probably stopped the attacks. I consider it Hezbollah's fault that civilian populations got hit, because they could have stopped it anytime, AND they chose to hide in those places and therefore make human shields out of the population.\n\n \n Of course you consider it Hezbollah's fault. You've sided with Israel since day one.\n \n What about Israel's alternatives to bombing these areas? Why were they not examined or implemented? There are alternatives, none of them would be as simple, cost effective, or safe for the Israelis though......\n \n Why was Israel marching deep into Lebanon and destroying all of the infrastructure, forcing civilians to flee and find shelter wherever they could? Is this a reasonable response in your opinion to the kidnapping of prisoners? Why didn't the US just blow up Iran if that were case?\n \n You can place the blame with Hezbollah all you want, and I will place blame there too, but Israel is no white knight in the conflict, far from it.\n \n Waxy",

If it's 50%, let's kill that 50%\n\n \n What I seem to be suggesting is in fact exactly what I'm suggesting. IMHO, the truly extremist muslim faction, those actively seeking to perpetrate violent acts of terrorism against civilians, is not nearly as large or powerful as it's made out to be.\n \n IMHO, the number of radical muslims as a percentage of the muslim population is very small. The total number of muslims in the world is estimated to be around 2 billion. 1% of that number is 20,000,000. I have a hard time believing that there are 20 million radical muslims actively working towards killing or converting all infidels. We had all better hope the number isn't 1%, because trying to kill 20 million muslims is tall order. In fact, it's beyond that, it's an impossibility, so we had better get to work on some other methods of reducing their numbers and their impact.\n \n More likely IMHO, we're dealing with a small number, 20,000? 200,000? 2 million maybe?\n \n Those numbers are manageable. No doubt many will have to be arrested or killed as they are extremists and beyond reason, but the key is to limit the ability of the group to resupply itself, ie, reach the other 1.88 billion or so muslims out there and enlist their help in putting an end to the extremism.\n \n To simply believe that trying to kill somewhere between 20,000 and 20 million muslims is the key global peace is so far from being a reasoned and logical position that I can't even begin to address it.\n \n \nYou profess a rather profound understanding of the \"radical muslim\" community. I call B.S.\n\n \n Delightfully unoriginal.\n \n At any rate, my point doesn't require a profound understanding of the radical muslim community, only an elementary understanding of supply and demand and birth vs death rates.\n \n \nNot only is it my opinion, it is the opinion of each and every Muslim acquaintence I have. It is also the opinion of several radio commentators and guests on talk shows.\n\n \n Well then, how can I argue with insurmountable documented evidence like that. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nDream on, my friend. Radical Muslims are having babies and training them from birth.\n\n \n I'm sure they are, doesn't mean we shouldn't be doing all that we can to minimize the number of new recruits they can acquire, or giving the children of radicals other options.\n \n \nPerhaps you could read history books and determine for yourself where the long periods of relative peace have occurred. It's not a Christian viewpoint...it's the way it is.\n\n \n Perhaps you could read some history textbooks as well, and realize there's more than one side to the story.\n \n \nCommon sense and the ability to reasonably observe the world around me is what makes me question your claim to know how quantities have changed.

I think any reasonable person would see that for what it is.\n \n \nWe haven't killed enough of them to make a difference in their planning. Our efforts have not gone unrewarded though because we just recently saved a bunch of people by foiling the plot that is the topic of this thread.\n \n Likely, your do-nothing, try-to-talk-them-out-of-it, and your let's convince the non-radicals to stay nice routine would have allowed the recent plot to succeed. Your likely not even in favor of maintaining databases on known terrorists because it invades their privacy.\n\n \n Because for every one we kill or capture, there are 10 waiting to assume their position. Osama himself has stated that after the US killed Zarqawi.\n \n Our efforts to increase security and court cooperation of the muslim community were successful in foiling the attempt. I'm not sure how you're going to tie that to the Iraq war, or the Israel/Hezbollah conflict, but feel free to try.\n \n As for your opinion on my stance, again, you're welcome to it. It's baseless, and there's no way you could support it concretely, but you're welcome to it.\n \n As for my being in favour of maintaining databases on known terrorists, of course I'm in favour of it. Your pathetic attempt to paint me as being entirely \"mamby pamby\" on the issue is just that.\n \n \nYou could be right. But the radicals will fight to the death no matter who is trying to stop them. We'll either have to capture and imprison all of them or kill all of them or a combination of the two.\n\n \n We certainly will, at least those that perpetrate terrorist attacks. The thing is, I'd like the situation to have an possible end, not continue in perpetuity.\n \n \nYou've made a ridiculous argument here. Convert or die has long been the battle cry of the radical Muslims.\n\n \n Actually I've made a very logical and sensible argument, admittedly reinforced with hyperbole to show the tenuous nature of your questions and assertions regarding the possibilities that exist in dealing with radical muslims, and the reality of anyone ever having to actually deal with them on the scale you seem to imply is inevitable.\n \n \nYou need to project your protective nature onto the whole peaceful world rather than just your own family. To say that you'll probably die of something else before the radical Muslims get to you is just a way of saying you don't really care about the ones that they are getting to.\n\n \n Hardly. However I'm not surprised you would construe it's meaning as such in a typically righteous and self serving manner.\n \n It is simply an expression of the scale of the threat. This is not an immediate life or death threat to the average citizen of the world as you seem to be implying. \n \n \nHis goal (or part of it) is to destroy the United States. (That includes and requires killing the people.)\n\n \n Please point out to me in ANY of these links where Osama has declared that killing or converting all Americans, or as you have asserted elsewhere, all infidels is his goal.\n \n It seems fairly clear to me that he has stated several goals, regaining control of the arabian peninusula (ie eliminating Israel) and it's resource wealth being the primary one.\n \n He has declared war on the USA and its citizens, as they are the major supporters of what he perceives as his enemies. He doesn't however call for the complete destruction or conversion of the USA in any speech that I've been able to access, only to the point that the USA no longer controls or influences the arab peninsula or islamic nations. \n \n That's not pretty, but it's a far cry from \"convert or die\".\n \n http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden%27s_Declaration_of_War\n \n http://www.ict.org.il/articles/fatwah.htm\n \n \nI believe you'll find the wrath of God in Revelations, my friend...and you seem to misunderstand the \"turn your other cheek\" bit.

Pick a topic, and stick to it, you're arguing against a strawman.\n \n The point I'm making here is that you can't expect those that are fighting the US military machine (interchangeable with the Israeli military machine) to do it on an \"equal playing field\" because that is impossible. Guerilla warfare - complete with all the bad, it's dirty, just look at Vietnam - is the only option available to them. That means fighting their battles on the bombed out streets of civilian neighborhoods, hand to hand.\n \n IMHO, the reports of intentional use of civilians as shields has been overblown. I wouldn't for a second deny that it takes place, and again, I can't defend it, I just question how truly prevalent it is. Trying to get a straight answer on that from the media or the internet is like trying to find Jimmy Hoffa.\n \n The fighters for Hezbollah have no control over the actions or whereabouts of civilians in a war zone. I know that these civilians in the majority of cases are simply unable to escape or leave the area, but many are there by choice, ignoring both the Israeli warnings and the presence of Hezbollah fighters. \n \n I find it hard to believe that the argument is repeatedly made in the defense of US and Israeli bombing that \"collateral damage\" ie civilian deaths, is inevitable, and yet the same slack is not granted to Hezbollah. I don't believe for a minute that all of these civilian casualties are freely accepted, in fact planned, by the fighters of Hezbollah - these are their family, friends, and countrymen that are dieing.\n \n \nThat's not true; I realize Israel's faults as well on this. I still think there's a difference and that Hezbollah is the one in the most wrong here.\n\n \n Most wrong? Wrong is wrong.\n \n \nSuch as? What are all these alternatives you keep talking about?\n \n What specific solutions do you think there are?\n\n \n Rather than bombing the areas they believe Hezbollah is using, especially those where they believe there is a high likelyhood of civilians being present, why not send in troops? Surely there would be less likelyhood of civilian casualties if rather than using bombs you had trained soldiers on the ground searching out the Hezbollah fighters. On top of that, the entire infrastructure would not be destroyed in the process\n \n The problem is, there would be far more Israeli casualties, and far greater cost. Hand to hand combat on the streets eliminates the massive technical advantage the Israelis have and creates what they want to avoid - a level playing field in the battle. Even though Hezbollah would be vastly outnumbered, hand to hand fighting, street to street, is difficult and dangerous, and would undoubtedly result in more Israeli casualties.\n \n I'm not a military strategist by any stretch, it just seems to me that there has to be a better way, even if it isn't the easiest or cheapest way.\n \n Waxy",

   "Firstly, you're mixing and matching topics at your whim. Last I checked, the Hezbollah fighters in this current conflict were not setting off bombs in Israeli weddings. I know for a fact that I have never defended that, or even suggested that I can understand the motivation behind it. Pick a topic, and stick to it, you're arguing against a strawman.\n\n \n No, it's the same topic. I really think you need to go do some serious reading on Hezbollah and some of the things they've done. I'll grant you they may not have targetted weddings per se, but they've done their share of suicide bombings.\n \n \nThe point I'm making here is that you can't expect those that are fighting the US military machine (interchangeable with the Israeli military machine) to do it on an \"equal playing field\" because that is impossible. Guerilla warfare - complete with all the bad, it's dirty, just look at Vietnam - is the only option available to them. That means fighting their battles on the bombed out streets of civilian neighborhoods, hand to hand.\n\n \n And here it is you who is mixing and matching your topics at your whim. Suicide bombings, kidnappings, and the like aren't guerilla warfare; they're terrorism. There's no two ways about it. We aren't talking about Vietnam tactics here. That's not what's happening.\n \n \nIMHO, the reports of intentional use of civilians as shields has been overblown. I wouldn't for a second deny that it takes place, and again, I can't defend it, I just question how truly prevalent it is. Trying to get a straight answer on that from the media or the internet is like trying to find Jimmy Hoffa.\n\n \n If hezbollah, Al Queda, the Iraqi insurgency, or any other group hides among the civilian population knowing that their enemies will have to come into that population to attack them, they are using that population as human shields. There's nothing un-prevalent about that.\n \n \nI find it hard to believe that the argument is repeatedly made in the defense of US and Israeli bombing that \"collateral damage\" ie civilian deaths, is inevitable, and yet the same slack is not granted to Hezbollah. I don't believe for a minute that all of these civilian casualties are freely accepted, in fact planned, by the fighters of Hezbollah - these are their family, friends, and countrymen that are dieing.\n\n \n If they really cared about them they wouldn't be hiding among them, knowing Israel would be coming after them. It's that simple.\n \n As I said in the very first comment I made on this topic here, the difference is that some groups deliberately seek out civilian casualties, as opposed to having no choice but fight the cowards who hide among civilians in the civilian populace.\n \n \nRather than bombing the areas they believe Hezbollah is using, especially those where they believe there is a high likelyhood of civilians being present, why not send in troops? Surely there would be less likelyhood of civilian casualties if rather than using bombs you had trained soldiers on the ground searching out the Hezbollah fighters. \n\n \n Ah, sort of like the U.S. trained troops going into Baghdad and Fallujah. emoticon_xangel That doesn't sound like a better option to me.\n \n If you do some reading on Hezbollah leaders and their comments, you'll find that the only thing that would suffice for them is for there to no longer be an Israel. And I'm sorry, but I don't blame Israel for being opposed to that mentality.",

Take that same soldier, put him on the ground with a rifle, and he is less combat effective than a civilian with minimal weapons training. Our soldiers, and Israeli soldiers, have reached the point where they are just part of the software running their equipment. They are wetware. If the conflict was reduced to a ground war, utilizing strategies designed to minimize civilian casualties, not only would we see a higher rate of loss among our troops, there is a better than average possibility that we would actually loose the war. Outside of a few special forces units, our military is not trained for ground combat without the benefit of massive air support, artillery support, armor support, etc...\n \n This is how we fought in Somalia, and it did not go well. BUT, this is the way that we are pretty much supposed to fight under the Geneva conventions, which WE drafted. It is a little late to go back and whine that we don't want to follow the rules becuase we have not bothered to maintain the capability to fight in such a manner that civilian casualties are minimized.\n \n As far as the other guys and the GC....first, they are not required to follow it. Requirements as to who must follow the GC are clearly laid out in their text. It is unreasonable to expect a small, loosely alinged force to maintain the same standards as a real military. True enough this is an advantage for them, and this was considered whent he GCs were negotiated, but since we have pretty much ALL the other advantages, letting them have that one is not entirely unreasonable. Whether or not they ARE following the conventions is an entire different topic. Traditionally, basing military troops and assets in civilian areas, especially in an age of aerial surveilance, is the norm. The GCs have largely been interpeted as mening that you cannot base them in such a manner that large civilian casualties would be expected due to a MEASURED assault on them. For example, hiding a rocket launcher in a subdivision would be OK, since a MEASURED assault designed to minimize civilian casualties would be possible. However, hiding the same unit in a hospital or apartment building would not, because it would essentially be impossible to hit without mass civilains casualties.\n \n The \"new\" interpetation only came online after we started loosing the current round of wars. We lack the balls to go in on the ground and take these assets without killing a bunch of civilians, so we bomb the XXXX out of them from the air. \n \n What it boils down to is that it requires courage to fight honorably, and we are not that brave.",
