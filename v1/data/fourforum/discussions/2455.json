   "I heard a small blurp on the news this morning about the stir Bill has made.\n Sounds like he recognizes a problem with black culture. It also sounds like he is getting ripped by his own for talking about it publicly. \n \n Don't let the secret out Bill. You might force blacks to take responsiblity for themselves.",

   "Bill Cosby: Blacks can't speak English\n NAACP leaders stunned by remarks of prominent comedian\n Posted: May 20, 2004\n 1:00 a.m. Eastern\n \u00a9 2004 WorldNetDaily.com \n \n In the presence of NAACP President Kweisi Mfume and other African-American leaders, comedian Bill Cosby took aim at blacks who don't take responsibility for their economic status, blame police for incarcerations and teach their kids poor speaking habits. \n Cosby made his remarks at a Constitution Hall event in Washington Monday night commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Brown vs. Board of Education decision that paved the way for integrated schools, reported Richard Leiby in his Reliable Source column for the Washington Post. \n \n Leiby said Cosby's remarks were met with \"astonishment, laughter and applause.\" \n \n When Cosby finally concluded, Leiby said, Mfume, Howard University President H. Patrick Swygert and NAACP legal defense fund head Theodore Shaw came to the podium looking \"stone-faced.\" \n \n Shaw told the crowd most people on welfare are not African American. He insisted many of the problems his organization addresses among blacks are not self-inflicted. \n \n Cosby said, according to Leiby: \"Ladies and gentlemen, the lower economic people are not holding up their end in this deal. These people are not parenting. They are buying things for kids - $500 sneakers for what? And won't spend $200 for 'Hooked on Phonics.' \n \n He added: \"They're standing on the corner and they can't speak English. I can't even talk the way these people talk: 'Why you ain't,' 'Where you is' ... And I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk. And then I heard the father talk. ... Everybody knows it's important to speak English except these knuckleheads. ... You can't be a doctor with that kind of **** coming out of your mouth!\" \n \n The Post said Cosby also targeted imprisoned blacks. \n \n \"These are not political criminals,\" he said. \"These are people going around stealing Coca-Cola. People getting shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake and then we run out and we are outraged, [saying] 'The cops shouldn't have shot him.' What the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his hand?\"\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------",

   "Personal Pledge 32 \n by Larry Elder \n \n 1. There is no excuse for lack of effort.\n 2. Although I may be unhappy with my circumstances, and although racism and sexism and other \"isms\" exist, I know that things are better now than ever, and the future is even brighter.\n 3. While I may be unhappy with my circumstances, I have the power to change and improve my life. I refuse to be a victim.\n 4. Others may have been blessed with more money, better connections, a better home environment, and even better looks, but I can succeed through hard work, perseverance, and education.\n 5. I may be a product of a single- or no-parent household, but I will not hold anyone responsible for my present, or allow anyone to interfere with my future. Others succeed under conditions far worse than mine.\n 6. Some schools and teachers are better than others, but my level of effort, dedication, curiosity, and willingness to grow determine what I learn.\n 7. Ambition is the key to growth.\n 8. I will set apart some time each day to think about where I want to go, and how I intend to get there. A goal without a plan is just a wish.\n 9. \"Luck\" is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.\n 10. If suitable role models are not nearby, I will seek them out.\n 11. A role model is someone who, through hard work and a positive outlook, has achieved.\n 12. A role model may be a parent, relative, friend, church member, judge, doctor, attorney, businessperson, or someone I've read about in the newspaper or seen on the local news.\n 13. I will contact role models and seek their advice, guidance, and counsel. People remember when they were my age and are eager to help.\n 14. I will seek out recommended magazines, articles, books, biographies, videos, and motivational and how-to books, and use them for education and motivation.\n 15. The light is always green. You cannot go full speed with one foot on the brake.\n 16. I am always \"in school,\" and I will not waste my summer by failing to read about and speak to people who can inspire me.\n 17. I will avoid friendship with people who do not share my goals and commitments. Nonsupportive relationships waste time and energy.\n 18. I will not seek immediate results, as I understand life is a journey and not a destination.\n 19. I will read a newspaper each day.\n 20. I will entertain myself in ways that challenge and expand my mind. As someone said, a mind once expanded never returns to its original size.\n 21. I will pay attention to my diet and overall fitness, as they are the keys to a healthy and productive body and an enthusiastic mind.\n 22. Drugs are stupid. People who believe in drugs don't believe in themselves.\n 23. I understand that jobs of the future require more preparation and training than ever, and I am determined to obtain the necessary background.\n 24. A well-rounded, competent student studies math and science.\n 25. People are not born \"deficient in mathematical ability.\" Through hard work and dedication, the subject can be mastered.\n 26. It is essential that I learn to speak and write standard English. This is not \"acting white,\" but acting smart.\n 27. A strong vocabulary is the key to communication, and I will read books on vocabulary enrichment.\n 28. I expect sometimes to be teased, even ridiculed. This will not stop me; it will only make me stronger and more determined.\n 29. I control my body and will not create a child until I am spiritually, psychologically, educationally, and financially capable of assuming this awesome responsibility.\n 30. Life is difficult. I expect setbacks and will learn from them. Struggle creates strength.\n 31. Every day is precious, and one without growth is squandered.\n 32. There is only one me, and I'm it!",
