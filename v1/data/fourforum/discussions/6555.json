Science is a lot more everyday than philosophy, as is religion, and they both help people in different ways. But philosophy is needed to maintain the correct boundaries, and for personal intellectual and spiritual growth. If we live entirely within a faith-based world or a fact-based world then we find it hard to enter into dialogue with the Other or to evaluate or value systems. Philosophy remains outside and thus enables such meetings.",

   "The difference between philosophy and science is that philosophy grapples with phenomena that philosophers believe cannot be fully examined through observation and experimentation because of the nature of the phenomena. Science deals with phenomena that scientists believe can be fully examined through observation and experimentation. Often science will determine that there is not enough evidence to come to a definitive conclusion about something. Scientists may believe that all things can be understood through the scientific method, but that raises science to a religion because, try as they might, scientist have not been able to use the scientific method to establish that their belief \"that all that exists can be understood by using the scientific method\" is a valid scientific theory itself. Philosophy is a questioning of beliefs. - a questioning of the answers. Philosophy has imagination as its strong suit and sensory perception as its short suit. Science uses sensory perception as its strong suit and imagination as its short suit.",
