   "Why isn't there more being done about WWASP (World Wide Association of Special Programs) school's abuses? A little background, these schools are modern day reform schools located in The United States and Mexico run by an American for-profit company called WWASP, where troubled teenagers are sent by their parents. However after numerous investigations discovered that terrible things were occurring inside of these schools (no \"schooling\" going on, teens being forced to eat their own vomit, being chained up and beaten, being denied food or medicine for days, not being allowed to shave (girls), not being allowed to speak for 22hours a day, being put in small cages for days on end and then having their mail and phone calls home filtered for any negative speech about what goes on to their parents or loved ones) why isn't there more media outrage? 18 kids have already died, 5 of them suicides, others killed by school staff members. There have been some schools shut down and some convictions, but not nearly as many as I'd like to see.\n \n We as a country flip out when we hear suspected terrorists are being abused (and rightfully so), but we turn a blind eye to the teens being viciously tortured on United States soil? \n \n Where is the outrage over sending teenagers who have committed no crime to prison camps to be tortured?",
