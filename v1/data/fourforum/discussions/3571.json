   "\"In effect, the acknowledgment of the personal dignity of every human being demands the respect, the defense and the promotion of the rights of the human person. It is a question of inherent, universal and inviolable rights. No one, no individual, no group, no authority, no state, can change -- let alone eliminate -- them because such rights find their source in God himself. \n \n The inviolability of the person which is a reflection of the absolute inviolability of God, finds its primary and fundamental expression in the inviolability of human life. Above all, the common outcry, which is justly made on behalf of human rights  -- for example, the right to health, to home, to work, to family, to culture -- is false and illusory if the right to life, the most basic  and fundamental right  and the condition for all other personal rights, is not defended with maximum determination.\" from the Apostolic Exhortation Christifideles Laici  (On the Vocation and Mission of the Lay Faithful in the Church and in the World) issued by Pope John Paul II on December 30, 1988",

   "\"Adopting a consistent ethic of life, the Catholic Church promotes a broad spectrum of issues. Opposition to abortion and euthanasia does not excuse indifference to those who suffer from poverty, violence and injustice. Any politics of human life must work to resist the violence of war and the scandal of capital punishment. Any politics of human dignity must seriously address issues of racism, poverty, hunger, employment, education, housing, and health care. Therefore, Catholics should eagerly involve themselves as advocates for the weak and marginalized in all these areas. Catholic public officials are obliged to address each of these issues as they seek to build consistent policies which promote respect for the human person at all stages of life. But being 'right' in such matters can never excuse a wrong choice regarding direct attacks on innocent human life. Indeed, the failure to protect and defend life in its most vulnerable stages renders suspect any claims to the 'rightness' of positions in other matters affecting the poorest and least powerful of the human community\" (US Bishops, Living the Gospel of Life, 1998, n. 23).\n \n Not all issues are qualitatively equal from a moral perspective. A consistent ethic recognizes that there is justification for placing priority emphasis on certain issues at certain times. To ignore the priority attention that the problems of abortion and euthanasia demand is to misunderstand both the consistent ethic and the nature of the threats that these evils pose. To quote Cardinal Bernardin, \"A consistent ethic of life does not equate the problem of taking life (e.g., through abortion and in war) with the problem of promoting human dignity (through humane programs of nutrition, health care, and housing). But a consistent ethic identifies both the protection of life and its promotion as moral questions\"(Wade lecture, as above). \"The fundamental human right is to life-from the moment of conception until death. It is the source of all other rights, including the right to health care\" (The Consistent Ethic of Life and Health Care Systems, Foster McGaw Triennial Conference, Loyola University of Chicago, May 8, 1985).\n \n **quotes taken from Priests for Life website",

   "\"[...] the right to health, to home, to work, to family, to culture -- is false and illusory if the right to life, the most basic and fundamental right and the condition for all other personal rights, is not defended with maximum determination.\"\n\n This is why arguments like \"well, our population is out of control\" never convince ANY Pro-Life advocate that abortion is okay. I think it is amusing when pro-choice people use such arguments... Pro-Lifers have a priority list, and Life makes it to the top. For Pro-Lifers, it's a little like saying \"Well, Big Macs taste good, so you should never, ever eat filet mignon since burgers taste good!\" I mean, sure, burgers taste good, but filet mignon is so much better.",
