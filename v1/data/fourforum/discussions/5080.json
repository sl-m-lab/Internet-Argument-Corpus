   "So we go on and on about how we agree to give up some rights for safety and that the government derives its power from the consent of the governed. Why didn't they ask me for my consent? Many Constitutions include that if the government becomes unjust that citizens have the right to overthrow it and form a new government. New Hampshire has a phrase \"the responsibility of\" establishing a new government if the current one becomes unjust. A college kid killed a cop on the basis of that and now is being tried for the death penalty. While I agree that killing a cop is wrong what happened to this concept? It clearly isn't true. We have the right to establish a new government?? The South tried it and we started the civil war. Consent of the governed? How many people consented to what the government does? Regardless of whether they agree with it or not they weren't asked for consent.",

   "Well, first off, the civil war started because the United States was just ebcoming a world power, we had to distinquish ourselves with the minority of world powers. Other then that I completly agree with you. The tersm \"By the people, Of the people, For the people\" have COMEPLETELY been forgotten by the gov. Under some unknown right of the constitusion, we do have the \"right\" to secceed, but will face enormous opposition from the US if we do. And yes, I also agree shooting a cop is wrong, unless provoked to do so. There probly was a....well, a halfway good reason for the kid to do it, other wise i dont know any type of person who would do that unless he is mentaly unstable.",

   "It is very disturbing to see the American populace becoming increasingly sheep like in their servitude to the government which has obviously lost touch with reality and views itself as the aplha and omega of everything. \n \n As I've said in other threads, I believe that if we do not see a paradigm shift in the way the government works, within a few dcades at the most, there will be a major revolution movement, or the fall of the US as a united nation. Either one really. emoticon_cool",

Leaving the minorities rights to the whim of the majority. \n \n Example when Bush talks about the american people it is code for his and only his constituency, (conservativess, republicans, heterosexuals,evangelical christians, and flag worshipping ex military men) not all americans.",
