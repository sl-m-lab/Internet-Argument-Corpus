   "http://www.csis.org/gai/china_cdrom.htm\n \n \nBy 2040 there will be 400 million Chinese elders-which is more than the total current population of France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the UK combined. The vast majority are due to reach old age without a pension or health-care coverage. How China navigates its aging challenge will go a long way toward determining whether it achieves its aspiration of becoming a prosperous and stable developed economy. \n \n\n \n It is difficult to imagine that China in less then 40 years, may need to import young people from other Asian countries to maintain its economy as it ages. I expect that China will be dumping the one child policy within a few years other wise it is going to face an unprecedent number of elderly people to working age people. Which will put a huge strain on its society.",

Allthough one should try to minimize the costs of allready existing transactions as well as encouraging higher birthrates. \n \n Some data suggests that birthrates might be cyclical, in which case Europe (and the world) would face a different problem then an aging population. But hardly less severe...\n \n A problem with the new entrant states is that they soon have a (rapidly?) shrinking population. This might increase their labour costs prematurely.\n \n \nI got a laugh out of Muslims dominating Europe. Simple mathematics blows that one out of the water.
