   "Liberty University has revoked its recognition of the campus Democratic Party club, saying \"we are unable to lend support to a club whose parent organization stands against the moral principles held by\" the university....\n Part of [vice president for student affairs Mark] Hine's e-mail said, \"The Democratic Party platform is contrary to the mission of Liberty University and to Christian doctrine (supports abortion, federal funding of abortion, advocates repeal of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, promotes the \"LGBT\" agenda, hate crimes, which include sexual orientation and gender identity, socialism, etc.)\"\n\n Liberty U. bans Democrats - Ben Smith - POLITICO.com\n emoticon_wow\n \n Of course it's their right to do so. Liberty U is a private university.\n That isn't really a question.\n \n Nevertheless, the actions of this University are divisive and unreasonable.",

With that said this decision is a little disappointing because the kids in the organization were against many of the social issue stances of democrats like abortion and gay rights but drawn to the democratic party for other reasons. The university did make it known that they still support the students but I wish they would support the organization because you can at least say you are supporting the change of a party towards the stances you prefer. \n \n I hope they change their mind and perhaps just compromise on something.",

   "To Liberty it is all about God and frankly I think they are missing the boat on this one. With having a democrat party group that is still pushing the message of God you make a way for others to see your religion and that it isn't based on right vs left. Furthermore, these students don't have to give up their principals to do so. Republicans are not synonymous with Christian despite what some have tried to make others believe. Both parties are far far away from God. In any event, an opportunity lost for Liberty and it only results in more bitterness towards God. \n \n With disagree on everything Foundit but seems like this one is too obvious to disagree on.",

Just like the 'fairness' doctrine is wrong, so is Liberty U. Everyone should be able to speak their mind and congregate with whom they choose.",

   "I had the \"unfortunate\" privilege of obtaining my masters at Liberty U. That was back when the old man was in charge. Fundamental, ignorant. However the courses were hard as hell and included a religious component to each class. I did it because it was a video-commute deal back when these were courses were rare. \n \n I understand why they wouldn't want a different line of political thought to justify their narrow-minded dogma. It would be justice for them to loose their tax exempt status. Bet they would let the dems remain then.",
