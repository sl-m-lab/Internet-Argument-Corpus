He just blows with the political wind.\n 2. He consistently votes well outside the mainstream.\n \n I actually don't know what these 2 phrases really mean in any concrete sense, but how can one just go with the flow (be mainstream) and also be outside the mainstream?\n \n Are these just hollow \"talking points\" ?",

   "Heh, good point.\n \n But yes, trying to apply logic to a political party (any), especially the current republican party isn't going to get us anywhere. Besides, the republican party says that this election they don't do nuance. Arguing logic most certainly falls in the category of nuance. I mean, this is the party that currently counts fundamentalist religious zealots as part of their base. Arguing logic isn't going to get you real far there (*scrolls around this forum...*). Yep, some people just don't do nuance.",
