   "Fiery plane crash near Buffalo, NY, kills 50\n \n \n \nCLARENCE, N.Y. &#8211; A commuter plane dropped out of the sky without warning and nose-dived into a suburban Buffalo house in a fiery crash that killed all 49 people aboard and one person in the home. It was the nation's first deadly crash of a commercial airliner in 2 1/2 years.\n \n The cause of the disaster was under investigation, but other pilots were overheard around the same time reporting a buildup of ice on their wings &#8212; a hazard that has caused major crashes in the past.\n \n The twin turboprop aircraft &#8212; Continental Connection Flight 3407 from Newark, N.J. &#8212; was coming in for a landing when it went down in light snow and fog around 10:20 p.m. Thursday about five miles short of the Buffalo Niagara International Airport.\n \n Witnesses heard the plane sputtering before it plunged squarely through the roof of the house, its tail section visible through flames shooting at least 50 feet high.\n \n \"The whole sky was lit up orange,\" said Bob Dworak, who lives less than a mile away. \"All the sudden, there was a big bang, and the house shook.\"\n \n Two others in the house escaped with minor injuries. The plane was carrying a four-member crew and an off-duty pilot. Among the 44 passengers killed was a woman whose husband died in the World Trade Center attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n \n Federal investigators found the black box recorders in the plane's tail that could shed light on what went wrong, but they said the smoldering debris was still too hot to remove bodies. The recorders were on their way to Washington for examination.\n \n No mayday call came from the pilot before the crash, according to a recording of air traffic control's radio messages captured by the Web site LiveATC.net. Neither the controller nor the pilot showed concern that anything was out of the ordinary as the airplane was asked to fly at 2,300 feet.\n\n \n =snip=\n \n Now, I want to avoid politicizing this subject at all (Simone, Chester, this means YOU!!!!). The investigation is well underway and details are just now starting to come in. This was tragic indeed.",

   "On reading the results of the investigation....perhaps I spoke too soon. It appears the plane may have been on autopilot, contrary to FAA recommended practice.\n\n The results of the investigation will not be published for probably another year. Everything you are doing at this point is speculation. Ice may very well turn out to be the cause of the crash, then again, it may not be the cause. It is important to look at the obvious circumstances, but there are a lot of different things that could have caused the crash. \n \n \nBUFFALO, N.Y. - The commuter plane that crashed near Buffalo was on autopilot when it went down in icy weather, indicating that the pilot may have violated federal safety recommendations and the airline's own policy for flying in such conditions, a federal official said Sunday.\n\n Wrong. The article said:\n \n \nThe commuter plane that crashed near Buffalo was on autopilot until just before it went down in icy weather, indicating that the pilot may have violated federal safety recommendations and the airline's own policy for flying in such conditions, an investigator said Sunday.\n\n See what a difference a few words make? \n \n \nSteve Chealander, a National Transportation Safety Board member, said the company that operated the flight recommends pilots fly manually in icy conditions. Pilots are required to do so in severe ice.\n\n Define \"severe ice\". What were other pilots in the area reporting? Is a recommendation a requirement? \n \n \nThe preliminary investigation indicates the autopilot was still on when the plane crashed, he said. That has not been confirmed by information from the plane's flight data recorder.\n\n That was not from the article you posted, did you make it up? \n \n In fact, the article you posted states: \n \n \nAutomatic safety devices returned the aircraft to manual control just before it fell from the sky, Chealander said.\n\n \n Bottom line is that it is far too early to say what actually made the aircraft crash. It could be as simple as spatial disorientation or a malfunction of the flap system.",
