I don't oppose all forms of public education. There is a difference between public education and compulsory education.

If a public education system steps beyond this, it begins to promote a certain worldview/culture, leading to a homogenous society - fertile grounds for authoritarian cultural moralism.\n \n The ultimate defense against tyranny is a multicultural society.

Governments have been doing this since the begining of time.\n \n Don't give the government enough credit? Look what the government has done to our schools already. We have college graduates that test lower in math and science than french 8th graders. We have high school seniors that score lower in standardised tests in english than japanese kids do.\n \n I think that the local school board absed plan was a good idea, but somewhere along the way we lost the idea that members of the board needed to actually be qulaified, not just likable (god knows we have forgotten this in all other areas of politics). Also, federal intervention and requirements, as well as carrot and stick funding, have caused our educational focus to turn from simply educating children to indoctorinating them to a particular social order. \n \n Like so many other things in the US, we have failed to take responsibility for our kids, and their education, instead allowing government bean counters to do it. This has proven disasterous. Instead of addressing actual problems in education, we have elected to simply throw more money at it. Instead of pushing kids to meet difficult standards, we have simplified the standards. \n \n \n \n*key twilightzone music--enter conspiracy theory that's unprovable*\n\n \n Governments don't have a vested interest in ensuring that their population is easy to govern?

I don't think so.\n\n \n Strawman argument. \n \n Besides, accredited colleges are little more than diploma mills anymore anyway. As an employer, I hardly glance at educational background of prospective employees. Unless they are either Ivy League or have been involved in some impressive research programs, all that a college degree tells me is that they can read and write at an 8th grade level. \n \n \n \nI don't know.

Frankly, when I was elected to the local schoolboard, I was a little surprised as I researched public eduaction at how bad it has become. Did you know that only 4% of public high school seniors can pass a standardised 8th grade test from the 1940's? In private schools, that number is 27%. Still not impressive, but better.\n \n I don't think colleges are much better. I already knew that a college degree meant next to nothing, but I was a little surprised when I started looking into exactly how bad things had gotten. I started by going and talking to some professors at the local college that I am frindly with, then spoke to some of the college interns I work with, then spoke with some business associates in other parts of the country.\n \n The outlook is pretty sad for todays college students.",

   "Less than 30% of private school students can pass an 8th grade exam, while 4% public school can.\n \n \n 1. What is taught compared to the 40's test?\n 2. WHo's taking the test?\n 3. What study says this, and where from can it be accessed online?\n \n COnsidering the vast differences between Public and Private schools and the factors that influence the education in both, tis quite pathetic that they can only reach less than 30%.\n \n Private schools have no oversight, can make up their own curriculum, don't have to hire qualified teachers, don't take the same tests as public schools, and they cherry pick students for the best gain, minimal problem.\n \n Most students aren't even admitted to private schools. The \"selection process\" is sooooooo difficult and picky. It's easy to raise scores when you deal with little to no problems and you pick what you want.\n \n WHen you look at what PUblic Schools have to deal with, you can't even logically compare Public and Private. Private schools ought to do WAY better, but as you yourself showed, they don't.\n \n \n \n Yet when you look at educational stats between public and private schools, the private schools always seem to come out on top. If my kids are going to be brainwashed at shool, I would prefer tehy at least get an education, too.\n \n\n \n ANd I know one's that don't. There are, as explained above, even  more  rationalizations for why one does slighly better than the other. Judging by your own post, they don't do much better, which is quite pathetic, considering their result-skewing advantages.\n \n \n Myriad of subjects that are not subjective? I was really only aware of mathematics and some of the sciences. Most everything else is subjective.\n \n\n \n Yes. there are myriad subjects that could be used that aren't subjective. Logic, Maths, Sciences, Economics, Anthropology, Forensics (some schools do use these classes). School ought to make a rational, pragmatic citizen-- a social reconstruction. Subjective courses should be reserved for electives and college.\n \n \n \n It is not a matter of a conspiracy theory. Those in power always wish to remain that way, and the most effective way of doing it is to control the way your followers think. Governments have been doing this since the begining of time.\n\n \n SHow some modern studies that say this about the state of education as a whole.\n \n I can believe you that it's POOR, but not for the reason you are assuming. There's no study for that I am aware of untill provided. It's poor because most people are stupid and naturally retarded and the teachers switched teaching methods to a new philosophy. \n \n \n Don't give the government enough credit? Look what the government has done to our schools already. We have college graduates that test lower in math and science than french 8th graders. We have high school seniors that score lower in standardised tests in english than japanese kids do.\n\n \n Many foreign countries have state run publics as well. They do better than American ones, in some things, worse in others. It's not the government, it's the people who make up the government and an ill-educated populace.\n \n Private schools don't do that well in the US either. REmember that 27% number. Not very good for an 8th grade test. bettr, but not good at all. \n \n If you praise the government schools of other nations, that's the solution. Implement those.\n \n Japanese schools have a totally different standard and mindset. DO you know how Jap schools are run in \"highschol\" and \"grammar school?\" I do. It's a lot different. Government isn't the problem. People are.\n \n \n \n \n Governments don't have a vested interest in ensuring that their population is easy to govern? That is just common sense.\n \n Common-sense isn't truth, nor is it logic. Common sense is oft-wrong.\n \n Grow up. Either make an argument or remain silent. Childish little barbs get you no points.\n\n \n As soon a you back up your conspiracy-assumptions with credible studies,instead of relying on personal experience and anecdotal evidence. Also, stop blathering on about how Accredicted Colleges and degrees are meaningless. YOu haven't the foggiest idea about what you are talking. THey are very useful, since \"my\" contacts hire based on that and they are important for getting jobs.\n \n You don't know, obviously, what acdredited and nonacdredited means, nor their value. If you did, you wouldn't say something that silly.\n \n \n \n SOME schools rip off taxpayers: for example Benedict College. This isn't all of them, nor is it the majority. Ivy leagues aren't that much better. Many private colleges are to blame as well. \n \n American Colleges, according to foreigners from other nations, are some of the best in the World, at leats the accredited ones. Some are better than others, however.\n \n \n \n \n Strawman argument.\n \n Besides, accredited colleges are little more than diploma mills anymore anyway. As an employer, I hardly glance at educational background of prospective employees. Unless they are either Ivy League or have been involved in some impressive research programs, all that a college degree tells me is that they can read and write at an 8th grade level.\n\n \n Not a strawman. You are clearly stating that accredited schools are't good, there is no difference between them and diploma-mill non-accredited schools. This is nonsense and a blatently blanketing statement with no study behind it. You have also repeatedly stated the government is ueber bad and screws up everything, and that it's brainwashing the masses (although, the latter has offered 0 proof for its existence). You also believe that Private Institutions are da bomb, when they clearly suck, just a bit less, but do to all their advantages, it's even more pathethic.\n \n You back your stuff up with self-appeal to schoolboard membership and anecdotal evidence.\n \n As well, this is all comming from someone who idotically admits that he doesn't even look at people's resumes according to institution and educational background and who wonders why education and worker level is poor. The irony seeps forth, and it's your own fault in the cyle of problems that you don't check education level.\n \n Furthermore, Ivy Leagues aren't all they are cracked up to be. They are expensive, hard to get into, but almost impossible to fail out of. Harvard is one example. THey do quite a lot ot keep you in and maintain their good image.\n \n Outside of your own little world of Daewood opinion, Accredited Universities  do mean a lot. Certain degree's don't, however, because of demand and the number of people going to college.\n \n \n \n \n I don't think colleges are much better. I already knew that a college degree meant next to nothing, but I was a little surprised when I started looking into exactly how bad things had gotten. I started by going and talking to some professors at the local college that I am frindly with, then spoke to some of the college interns I work with, then spoke with some business associates in other parts of the country.\n \n The outlook is pretty sad for todays college students.\n\n \n Yea. ANd my \"business associates\" and \"professors\" say the opposite. Bamn. Anecdotal evidence useless.\n \n \n \n 1. Because extraordinary numbers of U.S. citizens aren't very bright, dumbed down books and simplified courses have given students with average to low average IQs an excellent chance to reach their fullest potential. But the authors admit this potential is not very high.\n \n 2. Therefore, Americans should not be alarmed if 20% to 30% of the nation's seventeenyearolds can't read. Critics of U.S. schools must realize that \"in a universal education system many students will not reach the level of education that most people view as basic.\"\n \n 3. But critics should be alarmed to learn that dropping tough subjects and grading down textbooks have not helped students with the highest IQs. Such diluted instruction is not challenging to those with the brightest, inquiring minds.\n \n 4. So, because we can't raise low IQs with better nutrition, Head Start, Chapter I, or adoption (and democracies certainly can't use Hitler's government-sponsored cohabitation or China's mandatory sterilization), the only way to improve American academic performance is to take some of the billions spent on teaching the disad vantaged and use it to give students with the highest IQs the best possible education. Hopefully, we can produce compassionate super citizens who can make the right decisions for the 3 out of 4 Americans old enough to vote who can't read a propo- sition on a ballot or can't read a newspaper article explaining a proposition on a ballot.\n \n Of course the argument that America's disastrous educational performance is due to mass inheritance of inferior minds plus the failure to adequately educate the very few with genetically superior minds is valid only if Murray and Herrnstein can prove that average American students have never learned any more than they are learning today. The Bell Curve psychometricians meet this challenge by offering proof that average students in earlier 20th century American schools were even less academically proficient than average students in later 20th century schools. They say the necessary evidence is in three sets of standardized test scores:[24] 1. Consistently low scores on Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Tests (PSATs), given regularly to groups representing all 11th graders not just college bound juniors between 1955 and 1983;\n \n 2. Low, unchanging scores on NAEP tests, regularly given to cross sections of all high school juniors between 1969 and 1990;\n \n 3. Rising scores on Iowa Basic Skills tests given annually to Iowa 9th graders since 1940 (except for a 14 year drop between 1964 and 1978, termed \"aberrational\" by Murray and Herrnstein though it parallels the 90 point SAT slide between 1963 and 1980).\n \n If analysts are unaware of the 400% increase in illiteracy among military registrants between World War II and the Korean War (195053) and the 4000% increase in 4th grade illiteracy among registrants with at least 4 years of schooling during the same period, the 35 years of PSAT and NAEP tests scores for 11th graders seemingly give strong support to the Murray-Herrnstein argument. Here are the results:[25]\n \n The 1955 PSAT averages for all juniors were considerably lower than the comparable 1983 averages.\n \n The 1969 NAEP scores for all 11th graders are virtually the same as the 1990 scores.\n \n And neither of these PSAT and NAEP averages for all juniors seem to have been affected between 1963 and 1980 by the steep, 90 point slide in SAT scores for college bound seniors supposedly proving the MurrayHerrnstein contention that only students with high IQs have been hurt by dumbed down books and curriculum.[26]\n \n But some former Defense Department manpower specialists are aware of that increase in illiteracy. They remember the shocking dive in AFQT scores during the Korean War when a reluctant Army rejected over 600,000 young men because they couldn't read road signs, orders, and safety instructions. They know that 1955 testing for all 11th graders was too late to show the enormous difference between very literate World War II registrants and barely literate Korean War registrants. Thirtyfive years of PSAT and NAEP cross-section testing AFTER 1955 cannot show what 20 million AGCTs and AFQTs taken in the 15 years BEFORE 1955 clearly suggest: The World War II generation was the last highly literate generation produced by American public schools in the 20th century. [27]\n \n However, the 24 years of rising scores on the 9th grade Iowa Basic Skills Test between 1940 and 1964 are not so easily dismissed. Why were SAT scores the highest and Iowa scores the lowest in 1941? Why did Iowa scores rise while SAT verbal averages sank 24 points and AFQT scores dropped out of sight during the Korean War? [28]\n \n Testing specialists know that giving the same test for successive years will produce higher scores because teachers consciously or unconsciously teach the test. This explains some of the increase. Surely the test was modified and renormed for national sales several times during those 24 years. If so, 9th graders in Iowa, many times the state with the highest ACT average, would make higher percentile scores because 9th graders in other states made lower percentile scores. There is a plausible reason. However, believing that the educational level for Iowa 9th graders rose while the 4th grade literacy rate among millions of young military registrants with at least four years of schooling from every state in the U.S.A plummeted from 99.5% to less than 80% is not plausible.\n\n \n The Majority of American are now and were then stupid anyway, according to this study.\n \n \n \n To put it simply, schooling doesn't start, even for potential geniuses, until students learn to read. And because American teachers switched in the 1930s from reading instruction that worked for everyone to reading instruction that neuroscientists now tell us does not work for anyone, schooling has never begun for over 43 million Americans with an average 12 years of school attendance. And every year the number of high school graduates who receive diplomas they cannot read grows.\n\n \n This is also interesting insomuch that teachers are largely to blame for switching their teaching methods for reading, causing increasing illiteracy. Remember, the major problems are not the big bad gub'ment, but the big bad teachers and teacher's unions combined with natural human stupidity.\n \n \n \n \n American College Testing Corp. 1984. 25 Years of Service to Education: ACT 1984 Annual Report: Iowa, City, IA.\n \n Angoff, William H.

Only 2% in 1999 had a problem with the actual state of education, referring to the curriculum. MOst problems were other issues.\n \n Few TEachers in private and public education even considered curriculum and challenge to be a problem\n \n The problem  is somwhere else, and it's unavoidable if you want to give everyone education and not cherrypick.\n \n \n \n \n \n SOme other facts from the Department of Education:\n \n 1. Traditional public secondary and combined schools were more likely to offer Advanced Placement (AP) courses than were private and public charter secondary and combined schools. Among secondary and combined schools, and estimated 51.2 percent of traditional public schools offered these courses, compared with 35.7 percent of private schools and 30.5 percent of public charter schools.\n \n 2. Professional Development\n \n Among full-time traditional public school teachers, 59.3 percent participated in such professional development activities, compared with 55.2 percent of full-time public charter school teachers and 43.1 percent of full-time private school teachers. \n \n ull-time traditional public school teachers were more likely than full-time teachers in other sectors to participate in professional development activities on the uses of computers for instruction. An estimated 70.7 percent of full-time teachers in traditional public schools participated in such professional development activities. This contrasts with 56.9 percent of full-time teachers in public charter schools and 52.1 percent of full-time teachers in private schools.\n \n 3. According to the department of education statistics on comparison of Private and public schools, there are't  that  many differences in achievement percentages in math, science, and reading. At most, the 12 grade public math ranks 15 points lower than the private. Not much, for all their \"benefits.\"\n \n According to the study, the advantages of private schools can easily be achieved in both areas if teachers, parents, and staff communicate and raise standards and educational environment.\n \n However, one problem they mention is that this is difficult when you want education for the masses. Private schools are good for a minority, not the majority.\n \n THeir advantages stem from fewer people, a \"better\" environment. Depending on the institution, some have higher level curriculae. ONe problem is that when you have education for the masses, most people are stupid, and they dumb it down.",

   "Well it's not like public schools do much better at educating if it were optional. I don't see why it would be so bad if it were optional, but since your guardian has control over you, your parent/guardian can force you to go. As of now, kids who don't care and know their parents don't care just cut class anyway. The problem I think is that other country's schools teach the whole school year, here schools teach about half the time and teach how to pass tests and take tests the other half, and since we've only been taught how to pass US tests, we fail the other tests. And private schools don't all \"pick and choose\". I went to a private school where the policy was first come first serve. I still don't see how you don't see 30%-4% a big difference. This is more than 7 times as good as public school students. What we need is more freedom in the curriculum and less testing, yet we are going in the opposite direction with NCLB. Well only 2 more years in public education left.",

I'm not for totally privatizing education, just for the public schools to fix the method of education, but since the XXXXXX at the head of education seem to think more tests will help kids learn better.\n \n \n \n\n Where will you put the masses who don't fit the bill? \n \n\n In public schools along with the majority of the population.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n I agree that you shouldn't have schooling to pass a test. But that ought to be fixed in the public education system, thus eliminating that problem. I do, however, fully support supervision and standardization of curriculum. I dont want everyone learning something different.\n \n\n I think there should be a basic curriculum that each teacher would have to cover but then freedom in the rest of it. The problem is now if some people don't understand a topic the teacher can't explain it to them because they need to get a certain ammount done to keep up with the curriculum. So they end up teaching the stuff that will be on the test but not allow for any actual understanding. If people have extension questions we can't because then we might not fit in what's on the curriculum.\n \n \n\n That's a problem at my college. Some professors in the same subject teach totally different stuff and have different grading procedures, so you can never really equate one grade or level of knowledge to someone elses in another, yet similiar class.\n \n\n That's why I really don't think grades are effective as they are meant to. I was in an english class which was 8th period (the rest of the school has 7 periods, but in the math/science magnet we have 8) and the English teacher gave her 7th periodd class an open-note test. We got a regular test. It was the exact same class (honors English 9) so on our transcripts they will show up the same yet ours was harder. I think reccomendations should be the main part of consideration, not grades. But I don't mind different classes teaching different things as long as they all cover the basics.\n [/quote]\n \n \n\n I don't think there should be standardized testing, but I think they should all have strict science/math etc minimum standards.\n \n\n Yes, standardized testing is where teachers teach us how to pass the tests. Tests have their place, but they are to test what we've learned, not as a guide on what to teach. In a perfect education system, the teacher should be able to give a \"pop\" final exam and kids would do fine. Of course they would have to lower the standard since kids wouldn't do as good when they can't memorize everything but have to know it long term. C used to be average but everyone wanted their kids to do better so now B is about average yet it doesn't look as good. People want kids to do better so they make it easier yet raise the standards, pointless if you ask me. The teachers should be able to give the first semester's final exam just randomly sometime in the second semester and that would truly measure how much they've learned and remembered.\n \n \n\n I agree that test mentality is a problem, but I doubt people who vote legislators into power will change their minds. There are many other problems with the education system as well.\n \n Americans just aren't that smart anymore, for a variety of factors. As well, teachers are contributing to the poor literacy rates, due to switching from effective to ineffective standards.\n \n\n Yes I agree. People voting don't seem to understand what education means. All that matters to them is high test scores and grades.\n \n\n Having a lot of immigration also brings down english literacy, so that can skew results. I am in favour of Bilingual education, but that got rejected. Bilingual education was where students were taught in their language while also learning english on the side.\n\n \n \n Yes we have a lot of people who know nothing but Spanish, but because of NCLB they have the same grade they need to pass as people living here all their lives even in English/writing. It's stupid.",

   " Actually you're right, it isn't linear. Because some people who don't have kids in the system would still be paying for it. Remember vouchers are only to help pay for private schools, not exemptions for life. So as people leave, the money/student in the system would go up.\n\n \n \n As long as they keep paying their taxes, I don't care what they do with vouchers. I don't want them to stop paying taxes just because they take their kids out of the public schools. THe money is still needed, even with lower numbers of kids.\n \n [quote]\n \n Ahh I see. I am only against totally replacing it or taking people out of the system (cash wise).\n \n \n In public schools along with the majority of the population.\n \n\n \n Do you see the problem with the logic of the people who want to get rid of public schools? They would have nowhere to go =D\n \n \n Yes I agree. People voting don't seem to understand what education means. All that matters to them is high test scores and grades.\n\n \n This usually happens when you have people who vote on behalf of Jesusland instead on Education.",

The problem is that they don't see it is really lowering them and has no solution for schools that don't meet the level. Most people will even say that the only thing wrong with NCLB is that it is underfunded.",
