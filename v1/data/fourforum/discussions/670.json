   "---\"Gun law: The point of no return\"\n \n Routine arming of the police would be a big cultural change for police and public, says former chief constable John Alderson\n \n After more than 30 years in the police service John Alderson has seen many changes. The former Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall tells BBC News Online that arming British police on a more routine basis could one day be inevitable. \n \"From a policing point of view, a society which is itself unarmed and has an unarmed police force is the ideal,\" says Mr Alderson. \n \n \"We only have to go to America to see that where everybody is entitled to have a gun and the police are not only shot at, but they also shoot each other in shoot-outs from time to time. \n \n \"That is the kind of situation that we have always looked down upon as being unwise. But you can't expect officers to go out on the streets of this country into armed situations and not be armed themselves.\" \n \n Mr Alderson believes that if more criminals carry guns and are prepared to use them, then the police have no option but to respond. \n \n \"At the end of the day if you are facing armed terrorists, you can't say, 'Excuse me chaps, you should put those guns down' - you have got to be able to respond in kind.\" \n \n He says that there could come a day when British police carry guns as a matter of course. \n \n \"I think again a policeman cannot do his job without the tools and if it is more often than not that firearms are likely to appear in incidents then you are getting near to the stage where policemen have to be armed as a routine measure in most cases,\" he says. \n \n Keeping the public informed\n \n \"It is no good going to a situation where members of the public are being threatened or shot at... and all you can do is hide behind a wall because you haven't got the means of defending these people.\" \n \n He believes it is crucial to keep the public was kept well-informed about any decisions regarding the arming of police. \n \n \"If it came to it that the chief constables collectively thought that they would have to take this move, and if the home secretary thought they would have to make this move, it would be very, very important to inform the public in advance and to educate them and to give information and to show them what the statistics were and what the risks were and so on,\" he says. \n \n \"It is not just a question of arming the police because it is a good gesture to serve notice on the criminals, it is more than that. It is a change of culture in our country that we would be unlikely ever to reverse, I think.\n \n \"I have always believed that the police and the public are in a contractual relationship with each other and in a contract you have got to have both parties more or less agreeing with what you propose to do. So a big change in police culture like this should morally take the public along with it. \n \n \"So they would have to be informed about it, MPs would have to talk to their constituents and explain why this is taking place, the press and the media generally would have to play a big part in this and it would be a big step.\" \n \n Culture of firearms\n \n Mr Alderson says the cultural change involved in arming police would have a big psychological effect on the British public and police alike. \n \n \"I was a soldier before I was a policeman and if you are walking around with a gun on you it gives you a feeling of omnipotence almost - that you can get away with stuff that you couldn't get away with if you didn't have a gun. In other words, a gun affects your mentality and that would have to be guarded against in my view. The police themselves would have to be trained about the whole question of the culture of firearms.\" \n \n \"Once you have done it I don't think you would ever undo it. I don't imagine disarming the police would ever be an easy task once they have been armed - the police wouldn't like it perhaps and the public may feel secure - to me, it is a very, very important decision,\" he says.---- BBC News\n \n \n What do you think? \n Should British police take up arms to increase their influence and risk more gun-related crimes? \n Or should they stay unarmed in a bid to keep guns of British streets?",

I cannot attempt to understand the work enviroment they deal with as it is drastically different from here in the US. They have a very different structure and a very different set of laws and rights, while at the same time similar. \n emoticon_confused I say if the cops want to remain unarmed, let them. Many I have spoken with on this subject believe either right or wrong that if they remain unarmed they will keep the number of gun crimes down. Are they right, I honestly dont know.

It is the standard arming of bobbies on the beat.\n \n \n [quore]Police do not need to produce their weaponry each time that an offense is made, I assumed that you may have realised it would most likely not be necessary for minor infringements, sorry if i didn't make that point clear.[/quote]Of course I did realise that, I just disagreed with your assumption that criminals would automatically give violent response, I'd have thought that even violent criminals would think twice about attacking a cop.\n \n \n \nI live in Australia, not the US, and the police regularly carry firearms. I would say that the majority of Australians still see police as friendly people who are there to protect the well being of innocent people.\nHmm, I've lived in Oz myself, and I wouldn't totally agree with that. But I agree, despite being armed they are not really seen any worse than the British police. Like I say I am mostly playing devil's advocate here.",

It is the standard arming of bobbies on the beat.\n \n \n I thought this response might be the case. So if a violent crime is committed, or being committed, police must first arm themselves before attending the scene of the crime? Seems like a waste of time, and given that it is imperitive that police get to the scene as soon as possible, seems to me that it threatens further loss of life. It's no good having a police officer patrolling on foot a block away from a violent crime if they aren't armed, and therefore have to go and get their firearm before attending the scene. \n \n \nOf course I did realise that, I just disagreed with your assumption that criminals would automatically give violent response, I'd have thought that even violent criminals would think twice about attacking a cop.\n \n \n I would think that the safety of police officers would come before that of law breakers, especially when they have been violent crimes. I don't argue that all criminals will act violently against police and try to run from the law, but it is a fact of life that some will. The fact that some will try and hurt pursuing police officers leads me to believe they should be armed so that they can protect themselves and the greater public.",

   "By ANDREW PARKER, \n MIKE SULLIVAN \n and JOHN SCOTT \n \n HERO cop Michael Swindells was hacked to death yesterday while trying to disarm a knife-wielding maniac.\n \n Unarmed Detective Constable Swindells, 44, chased the man and cornered him on a dusty patch of waste ground in a crime-ridden inner city suburb.\n \n As they fought the married dad was stabbed in the chest. The killer fled, leaving the cop dying on the ground, but was later captured.\n \n Last night it was revealed that DC Swindells died after answering a call that was intended for his uniformed colleagues.\n \n His wife and 18-year-old daughter were being counselled as they desperately tried to come to terms with the killing.\n \n Community leaders and police colleagues condemned the killing in Nechells, a crime-ridden Birmingham suburb.\n \n And Michael&#8217;s boss, West Midlands Chief Constable Paul Scott-Lee, saluted the &#8220;brave and heroic&#8221; officer, adding: &#8220;Many colleagues have today lost a friend.&#8221;\n \n DC Swindells was a policeman for 14 years. It is thought the dedicated officer raced to the scene yesterday after hearing the radio call.\n \n A man had reportedly &#8220;gone berserk&#8221; during a rent row at a council office.\n \n DC Swindells was the first cop on the scene &#8212; and found the suspect sitting on a wall. As he approached, the man pulled out a knife with a 12in serrated blade from a belt behind his back.\n \n The DC radioed for help and was quickly joined by six other officers. After a brief stand-off, the knife-waving man made a run for it.\n \n Officers gave chase, with DC Swindells hard on his heels. The lone cop caught up with him at a derelict spot beneath the Aston Express flyover and next to a canal towpath.\n \n During a violent struggle DC Swindells was fatally wounded.\n \n The other officers continued the chase with a team of police dogs. The suspect was caught and arrested after running through nearby Witton cemetery. \n \n Paramedics battled to save DC Swindells, who was unconscious and had a deep stab wound to the upper chest. They stabilised his condition but he was later pronounced dead in hospital.\n \n The killing left DC Swindells&#8217; colleagues horrified last night.\n \n Paul Tonks, chairman of the West Midlands Police Federation, said: &#8220;It sent a shiver down my spine.\n \n &#8220;This officer paid the ultimate price. We go on about policing being a dangerous role &#8212; this just proves it.\n \n &#8220;Officers go to work expecting to go home at night. Tragically, this has not happened today.&#8221;\n \n Last night police had cordoned off two houses near the site of the killing and a nearby park. One of the houses is thought to be the suspect&#8217;s home. Cops were also searching the canal.\n \n Motorists driving past the scene of the fight are believed to have witnessed the killing. \n \n One witness saw the killer with police in pursuit. He said: &#8220;I saw a man with a knife running down the street being followed by at least six policeman.\n \n &#8220;The man stopped, turned round and confronted officers with the knife. They seemed to back away from him, then he ran off over towards the towpath.&#8221;\n \n Nechells is a high-unemployment inner city area where drug-related crime is rife.There have been several drive-by shootings in recent years. \n \n \n above is why the cops should be armed. if one of the offsers had a gun there would, most lickly, have been a cop going home that night, and a criminal going to the morge.",

   "Hello!\n This is my first time on your forum so I'll be the \"Bloody Yank Police officer\".\n \n I am an American Law Enforcement officer with over 20 years on the job and hold the rank of Sergeant, I also carry a firearm and with this tool comes a grave responsibility but not just for the public but for the safety of my fellow brothers/sisters in blue, grey, brown or what ever color your department wears.\n \n I have several relatives who are Bobbies in the Met and all ask me the same question when I visit How do you go to work every day with that thing on your side?\n \n My explaination is usually the same to all.\n \n Policing for us is looking at the worst and hoping for the best where in the UK Its hoping for the best and looking for the worst we are also a less controlable lot.\n \n America has had firearms within it's history for over 227 years and modern Police forces have only been in existance for about 130-150 years and before this are constitution only allows us to use a standing army to protect us from enemies foreign and domestic it was not allowed at all to be a controlling army of our own people.\n \n It takes alot more descretion and control not to use a firearm than it does to use one, and as far as training is concerned we train constantly with the liability issues at hand.\n \n In the UK you have a country which has over 2000 yrs of recorded history we don't and as Benjamin Fraklin stated \"We are less refined, less cultured and less controllable\".\n \n Only time will tell if your police need firearms but we here in the US have had 227 yrs of training to deal with it.\n \n Sorry for the history lesson but look at our history.",

The report is actually about whether or not adding more police in a jurisdiction decreses violent crime (the answer si no, if you are interested, it actually raises it). The report is just entitled \"police strength assesment\". I got it forma firend who is a senior congressional aid back when clinton was pushing to put millions of extra cops on the street.\n \n Basically, the report shows that in the short term, extra cops on the street reduces crimes. In the long term, they reduce petty crimes, but violent crime rises drastically. They surmise that this is because people who commit crimes out of desperation are going to commit them anyway, but if you raise the odds of them getting caught, they raise the threshhold of what they are willing to do to get away. It also points out that career criminals are not likely to \"go straight\" just because their likelyhood of capture goes up, they are just going to adapt their tactics to adjust for the new threat.\n \n Interestingly enough, I have seen similar reports in regards to long prison sentences. Imposing rediculously long prison sentences does not reduce crime in the long run, it just encourages criminals to resort to violence if necessary in order to escape. \n \n So, as th the question of \"should british police be armed\", I would say that would depend on whether or not it would actually assist them in apprehending suspects and protecting the public, or would it simply encourage criminals to carry more weapons?\n \n Tough question. \n \n Of course, as things stand now, I donlt think it is probably really needed. In the course of my globetrotting, I have noticed a BIG difference between American cops and cops in other first world nations (britain, france, sweden, spain, etc....). I have yet to meet a british cop, or a french cop, or a swedish cop, and walked away thinking \"what a peckerhead\". I know a lot of American cops who have this effect on people. I am not saying that all american cops are peckerheads, just that the American police service seems to attract more than their fair share.\n \n A friend of my dads, who is a former chief of the LAPD expalined one time that this is becasue there are basically 3 types of people who become cops in America. The first group, and by far most numerous, are jerks who want to be cops because they want a badge and a gun and they want to feel like they have power over people. These are guys that got beat up one too many times in high school, or whose daddy touched their wanker, or who basically cannot attain a position of powe rin the private sector but lust after it. These guys are all jerks. This is the majority of Us law enforcement.\n \n The second group is guys who have a family history of being cops. Their fatehr was a cop, their gradfather was a cop, and now theya re a cop. According to my source, these guys seem tyo be arrogant jerks who think that they are better than other people, becasue they have a long family history of working a government job with poor pay, that we now test applicats for to ensure that they are not especially bright (LAPD has been diong this for years, and i hear that other departments across the coutnry are picking up this practice at an alarming rate). Personally, I would not brag about this, nor would it instill feeling of arrogance. Depression, quite possibly, arrogance, no.\n \n The third group, and rarest bunch I am told, are guys who become cops because they genuinly want to help people. I was told that there are usually only 5 or 10 of these guys in the entire LAPD at any given time. \n \n I don't think this is true in England. I have had several occasions to meet british cops (not as a criminal) and I have yet to meet one that seems to be an arrogant jerk or a power hungry nerd. They seem to be (at least the ones I have met) nice guys who are genuinly interested in helping you out. The ones I have met have been polite, helpful, and are more concerned with making sure that people remain safe than arresting anybody they can pin something on.\n \n If arming hte British police is going to turn them into a bunch of jerks who just want to have a gun and tell people what to do, I am fully against it.",
