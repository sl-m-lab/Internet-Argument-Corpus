   "Would it be appropriate to define what free will actually is?\n\n \n **\n It certainly aids our understanding when we clearly define our terms.\n \n \n\n How would any life form know if/that it was exercising free will unless it was sentient?\n\n \n **\n Two more terms needing clarification--\"know\" and \"sentient\". Contrary to the anthropomorphic view, 'to know' does not necessarily mean, 'to be actively conscious of'. Simply 'to be unconsciously aware' will suffice. As for 'sentient', it simply means to have sense perceptions, to be aware of external stimuli and dynamically responsive to them. As such, it is not far removed from, 'to know'.\n \n \n\n Surely will relates to a state of consciousness/sentience/awareness, as opposed to instinctive behaviour.\n\n \n **\n Relates to, yes, but at all levels, not just conscious analysis. Instinctive behaviour is not mechanically driven chemical reaction. It is a 'learned' _systemic_ behaviour that has been rendered 'automatic', or 'inherently habitual', but one that that does not arise out of mere chemistry, undirected and purposeless. Autopoietic systems, as live organisms, harness lots of chemical reactions to their purposes, and that takes intelligence, volition, and energy. Habitualizing certain behaviours, from simple internal chemical reactions to complex organismic behaviours, [such as migration, hive building, and whatnot], saves energy and increases systemic productivity. That's why we see so much of it in biology. But being systemically automatic does not render it deterministically mechanical. That which was built by volition, such as 'instinctive behaviour', always retains susceptible to change. Nothing that is mechanically deterministic can ever be altered. Instinctive behaviour is not mechanically determined. Anything that is not random, accidental, and unintentional, and/or is not mechanically determined, is not totally involuntary. Therefore it is at least partially volitional/voluntary.\n \n \n\n And if a fly ducks out of the way of a fly swat, is it survival instinct, or instinct + desire to keep out of the way i.e. will?\n\n \n **\n All of the above.

   "Volition, or free will, is the defining characteristic of life. All living systems appear to have some limited choice about how to respond. They respond in ways that are only statistically predictable. They are capable of surprising us. \n\n \n Nope. Again you make many errors. First of all if you believe plants or viruses have free-will {which is a strictly cognitive effect} then you are up the creek without a paddle. Or else you will have to admit that a thermostat in your home exhibits free will. That is not generally what people seem to mean by the term free-will.\n \n \nSome materialists claim free will is an illusion, doesn't actually exist. They insist that what we see as spontaneous responses are merely chemical reactions and deterministic brain interactions. \n \n \n Well humans if asked will tell you that they make choices among alternatives and this they may attribute to a capability which one can call free-will. Thats all observable. The question always boils down to just what is the underlying cause or mechanism which results in this property. Some free-will advocates will claim that free-will MUST be non-deterministic since if it were not it would not be \"free\" that deterministic processes cannot lead to choice as they EXPERIENCE it. However this implies a depth of knowledge which they do not have - namely a detailed knowledge of the ins and outs of how their brain works. In addition a debatable assumption is made which is in effect that deterministic systems cannot achieve that which is being experienced. This makes the claim that the free-will advocate KNOWS the actual limits of what deterministic systems can and cannot do. Thats an assumption I am not willing to accept since nobody really knows the limits of behavior of deterministic systems. IMHO the experience of free-will is real enough, but the mechanism is materialistic and even deterministic down to its foundations. In other words IMHO deterministic processes are capable of generating the mental experience we describe as free-will.\n \n By the way - what is free-will free of exactly? You do realize that it was originally formulated to get around the problem within theology of how to separate responsibility and accountability for sin from the sinless godhead?\n \n \nOther materialists acknowledge the reality of free will but claim science cannot deal with such unpredictable phenomena. They insist that science must pretend volition plays no real role in the real world of molecules and atoms. If biology must close its eyes to the defining characteristic of life, such biology is not science. It is a creation myth for materialists.\n \n\n \n I only acknowledge the existense of the experience to which we apply the label free-will. I do not acknowledge that the experience arises from non-deterministic, non-material, or vitalist processes. My basic reasons are given above.\n \n \n \nP.S. For some reason I am unable to reach my other post \"What drive evolution?\" I am always \"timed out\" and my computer is cut off from the wet site. So I'll start over here.\n\n \n So there you have an example of a deterministic system acting to suprise you with unpredictable behavior.

   "To the OP: Hello and welcome; we haven't spoken before so I hope we get on :) Anyway, on with the subject at hand:\n \n \nVolition, or free will, is the defining characteristic of life.\n\n \n This is a pretty bold statement. Does a bacterium really need to be able to make choices in order for its chemical processes to proceed? I'm not asking whether you believe bacteria make choices or have volition, I'm asking if you can demonstrate why it's necessary.\n \n Moreover, I'd be very reluctant to call something a 'defining characteristic' when the thing itself is so difficult to define and, indeed, impossible to be sure exists at all.\n \n Well, ok, maybe that's going a bit far. We and other organisms exhibit behaviour that can be vaguely labelled 'free will'. The question is therefore not 'do we have free will' or 'does free will exist' but rather 'what exactly does that label mean?'\n \n Say I touch something hot and pull my hand away - a reflex action. Deterministic? Let's say for the sake of argument it is. Instead, I might choose to hold my hand there and endure the pain. That 'choice' we would probably label an exercise of free will. But is it? If there's a reason I'm holding my hand there - it might be that I'm transporting a plate to the table and don't want to drop my dinner all over the floor - it's possible that we're just looking at determinism again, only with more inputs. If there's no reason, then free will is insane; indistinguishable from plain old non-determinism.\n \n It's perfectly plausible that the reason we perceive free will to exist is simply that we don't have access to all the same information other organisms use to make their decisions. They do something, we don't know why, and if we can't extrapolate or hypothesise a reason, we attribute our failure to the subject's possession of free will.\n \n One intriguing empirical indication that free will might not exist in the accepted sense is the phenomenon jokingly defined in 'The Meaning of Liff': \n \n DEVENTER: (n) A decision that's very hard to make because so little depends on it, such as which way to walk around a park.\n \n I'm sure all of you have experienced this in some form or other. \"Coffee or tea?\" \"Oh, I don't mind. Whatever's easier.\" When experiencing a deventer, you cast about for some fulcrum upon which to swing the decision, some criteria by which one choice could be deemed superior to the other.\n \n \nAll living systems appear to have some limited choice about how to respond. They respond in ways that are only statistically predictable.\n\n \n So do electrons fired through the diffractive equivalent of a double slit. Individual unpredictability does not imply free will.\n \n \nSome materialists claim free will is an illusion, doesn't actually exist. They insist that what we see as spontaneous responses are merely chemical reactions and deterministic brain interactions. Other materialists acknowledge the reality of free will but claim science cannot deal with such unpredictable phenomena.\n\n \n This is pretty slanted reporting, I have to say :) 'insist...merely' and 'acknowledge the reality'?\n \n I don't think you can actually tell me what free will is. You might say it's something you and I both have: the freedom to choose. However, that's not quite right: what we certainly have is the awareness of a choice being made. The awareness of alternatives. That's not the same as freedom of choice. Again, you might say \"I chose A, but I could have chosen B\". To which I would respond, \"Then why didn't you?\" If you can supply a reason, you have undermined your assertion that the choice was freely made. If you can't, then the choice was irrelevant, and free will is worthless.\n \n \nThey insist that science must pretend volition plays no real role in the real world of molecules and atoms. If biology must close its eyes to the defining characteristic of life, such biology is not science. It is a creation myth for materialists.\n\n \n Eloquently put, but it does rather all hinge on your assertion that volition is the defining characteristic of life, which you have not substantiated.",

I don't see a sharp boundary, and I don't place it at the same limits as you do. It instead seems to be a gray zone with cases that could arbitrarily and with equal justification go either way (like viruses) and travel back and forth across wherever the line is (like frozen blastocysts and people with stopped hearts).\n \n Edited to add the exception for tests after thawing.",

   "From http://www.advancedfertility.com/cryolab1.htm\n \nHere the cane with frozen embryos is being \"plunged\" into the storage tank. The tank contains liquid nitrogen at -196 degrees Centigrade (that's cold!)\n\n \n From http://www.infertilitydoctor.com/lab/lab_freeze.htm\n \n [edited to correct degree C symbols] Embryos can be frozen at different times after fertilization. Most typically, embryos are frozen 1, 3 or 5 days after the sperm and egg were put together. Freezing is a stressful process for an embryo, and only embryos that are growing well in the laboratory will tolerate the freezing procedure.\n \n Step 1. Before an embryo can be frozen, all the water that it contains must be removed. Since water expands in size as it turns to ice, water inside the embryo would burst (kill) the embryo if we simply placed it in the freezer. To prevent the embryo from shriveling as the water is extracted, we replace the water with antifreeze. Antifreeze is a solution that does not expand in size when it freezes. The embryo is cooled to room temperature as the water is replaced with antifreeze.\n \n Step 2. When most of the water has been removed the embryo is inserted into a carefully labeled vial, or more typically a small straw, and placed in the cooling chamber of a controlled rate freezer.\n \n Step 3. The embryo is then cooled very slowly at -0.3 degC per minute. Slow cooling like this allows the embryologist to have precise control over the freezing process, to maximize water extraction from the embryo and to prevent formation of large ice shards that could pierce the embryo.\n \n Step 4. The cooled straw is placed into carefully labeled metal canes and lowered into the tank with other frozen embryos. The entire process takes several hours and the embryo(s) are stored frozen at -196 degC in liquid nitrogen. Liquid nitrogen is a safe and effective coolant, which is easy to work with in the laboratory. \n \n ..........\n \n How are embryos thawed?\n \n The process of embryo freezing has already been explained. Thawing the embryos is simply a reversal of the freezing procedure.\n \n Thawing includes our SurTransferSM protocol. When an embryologist removes embryos from the freezer, a second embryologist is required to witness the act, and verify the identity of the embryos before they can be thawed. Under no circumstances can a lone embryologist remove embryos from the freezer.\n \n The embryos coming out of the freezer (at -196 degC) are warmed to room temperature in 35 seconds. This rapid thaw method minimizes damage to the embryo from ice shards. The embryologist has to remove the antifreeze from the embryo and replace the water that was removed at the time of freezing. This is done by incubating the embryo in decreasing concentrations of the antifreeze, and increasing concentrations of water. Over a period of 30 minutes, the embryo is stepped through 4 different solutions, until finally the antifreeze is gone and all the water has been replaced.\n \n The thawing procedure is performed at room temperature, and once complete, the embryo is warmed up to body temperature (37 degC). It can be ready for transfer in as little as 40 minutes after leaving the freezer. \n\n All its water is removed and it's filled with antifreeze and you want to call it alive? Can we try that on you, then?\n \n (For some reason, they can easily freeze and revive sperm and embryos, but not so much the eggs. Perhaps only the Y chromosome carries enough vitality, volition, and/or autopoiesis - here's your chance to make a few million, WW, bottle up some volition and figure out how to inject it into the eggs.) :)",

   "Wait, what, Jesus had antifreeze? ......\n \n \n Perhaps there are simply intermediate states that are neither dead nor alive, where your condition is uncertain, where \"not alive\" does not necessarily mean \"dead\", and you can come out of it in either direction. \n \n Suspended animation and dormancy (as in seeds) seem to offer the option that conditions can suspend normal metabolic operation or even that normal metabolic activities can be proactively shut down, pending the return of conditions that permit normal metabolic operations to resume, or pending the triggering of some sort of chemical cascade that is capable of kick-restarting normal operation, equivalent to the way we can jump-start a stopped heart with electricity.\n \n Many animals do a mild version of 'para-death' with hibernation, and seed dormancy can be pretty extreme - there's not necessarily a lot of obvious difference between a viable dormant seed and a nonviable one, if both are kept dry and cool. A few animals (notably the tardigrade) and lichens can match and even exceed seed dormancy. So why should more extreme shutting down and restarting be too much of a surprise? \n \n None of this requires that there be a special magic ingredient called vitality.

Or why if I have 1000 atoms of a radioactive isotope with a 1 hr half-life that 50 of the atoms will remain and the other 50 will on the average decay even though one cannot distinguish them in any way whatsoever at the beginning.\n \n The fact that one cannot assign causes to each event and thus distinguish which blastocyst will live, or which atom will not decay does not imply some higher cause such as \"vitality\" to argue in that direction simply because the cause is not known is madness and resorting to filling in the gaps with pure speculation or the gap argument.\n\n \n **\n IOW, you have opted for the alternative I offered here--\"Or are you going to appeal to darwinian magick, spontaneous generation, 'it just happens, that's all', and abandon causation altogether;-- and with it, science?\" And this exactly what I expected you to do.",

But such systems produce unpredictable results unless you have detailed and precise information regarding all the causative factors. Many such systems are so sensitive to initial conditions that one cannot track the causal chains {thats what chaos is all about}. The world of causation is not all smooth functions and easily predicted outcomes you know. Some causal relationships are extremely stiff as that numerical analysis folks wil tell you. For any embryo the difference between being thawed and living and being thawed and dead can be the differnce in the relative coordinate vector of just a few hundred atoms, or the residual water content during freezing of a few 0.01%, or a heck of a lot of uncontrolled factors. No matter how precise the protocols they do not offer the degree of control that one would like to have. Especially true for any disruptions due to nucleation of ice crystals etc. Basically its a dicey thing to freeze and thaw a delicate structure like an embryo. Its rather suprising that it can be done at all and keep any of them in a living state.",

I'm firmly convinced that you might as well be talking up phlogistons and ether, as you have provided exactly as much supporting evidence as is available for those two concepts.\n\n \n And since life is just advanced organic chemistry why should we now reinsert vitalist concepts where they are not needed at all? And yes vitalism was wounded by Wohler and by the early 1900s had pretty much bled out. There are few people like SS who would like to reestablish the idea of elan vital by moving the threshold for its appearance (necessity) up to the level of an organism, but they have not found any credible purchase in the empirical world. These days we are already (as organic chemists) up to the task of making functional viruses and well on the road to being able to build functional minimalist cells.

If \"vitality\" accounts for the sole difference between a live frozen embryo that is completely inactive and a dead frozen embryo that is equally inactive, I would think that application of vitality to the frozen dead embryo ought to revive it, and that injection of twice as much vitality ought to revive a dead embryo with a bit more damage than the last one, and so forth, and that this logic should extend to obvious corpses.\n \n I don't see that you've provided any reasonable evidence for vitality, other than you think it has to be there, because things have to be either alive or dead. I therefore think you are inventing a solution because you are misreading the problem. \n \n Note also that you can't identify vitality other than that which is possessed by living organisms and which makes them alive and your proof for its existence is that frozen revivable embryos must have it while frozen dead embryos can't, you are building yourself into a tautology.\n \n My view is close to the first part of your option C (a previously living and so far undamaged blastocyst is neither dead nor alive while frozen). However, the outcome is deterministic (albeit very hard to predict), depending on the lack of damage done during freezing and thawing, up to the reastablishment of conditions that allow metabolism to restart.\n \n \nAs for those blastocysts that did not thaw out viably, I assume that something in the thawing process disrupted the molecular bits, severing their connection to the Vitality which would have enabled them to manifest the empirically observable chemical/mechanical effects we associate with live organisms and their live organic parts. In short, they died on the operating table.\n I agree in full, except for the bit about \"severing their connection to vitality\". All the explanation that is needed is that \"the mechanical bits were disrupted to the extent that restarting their operation after a return to normal operating conditions was not possible\" - \"vitality\" just falls away as an unnecessary concept.",

But since I asserted that 'volition' is autopoietic dynamism, and that that is the essence of life, you could say that that I defined life as that quality found in a autopoietic, dynamic, self-serving, self-directing, complex and productive systems.\n \n Two posts after that 'definition' you brought in the silly obfuscation that a corpse was a dynamic autopoietic system--\n \"Seems that a corpse undergoing decomposition because it is being attacked and digested by its own enzymes constitutes a relatively dynamic system\",\n -- ridiculous, when obviously your example is not even a system, let alone a complex, dynamic, productive, and autopoietic system.\n \n \"sys\u00b7tem (s&#301;s't&#601;m) \n n.\n A group of interacting, interrelated, or interdependent elements forming a complex whole.\n A functionally related group of elements, \" [answers.com]\n \n But enough of that codswallop.\n \n \n\n There need not be any observable difference between a frozen revivable blastocyst and a frozen unrevivable one, but this in no way extends to the idea that there is no real chemical/mechanic difference between life and death in any case.\n\n \n **\n Sorry, neil, but a major principle of materialism is that any proposed phenomenon, if it is not either directly, physically, observable in and of itself, or, is indirectly observable via its observable effects on material substances, is automatically classified as 'supernatural', 'fantastic', and/or 'metaphysical'.\n \n Thus, in materialist terms, any \"real chemical/mechanic difference between life and death\" must be observable, if it actually exists.

One example being your attempt to obscure an inquiry into empirically observable 'signs of life' by pretending that the chemical phenomena found to be acting upon a corpse are indistinguishable from the chemical phenomena found to be acting within a live organism. \n\n \n Mike, I critiqued a specific part of your definition by saying that your specific use, without qualification, of inherent dynamism and motion as ways to distinguish a volitional system fom a non-volitional one aren't good, because dead corpses can be fairly dynamic, and frozen revivable blastocysts are not. They fall on the wrong sides of the definitional fence that you wish to erect between life and death. Post-mortem changes begin with processes that are going on within the living body (but uncontrolled and unbalanced), and as time passes they shift to include new factors and new processes as time goes by, so I haven't disputed that a decomposing body is doing different things from a live one. I said that you can't set the fence simply at the presence vs the absence of \"inherent dynamism and motion\" and get the corpse and the revivable frozen blastocysts on the appropriate sides for your argument, because the corpse is more inherently dynamic and mobile than the blastocyst.\n \n Secondly, I think your insistence that organisms have to be either alive or dead is misguided, because suspended animation / deep freezing are neither the one nor the other, and because you have problems separating \"dead-frozen\" from \"live but frozen\" (without thawing and finding out what happens). \n \n This is not quite your option C / Shroedinger's cat model, as I explained earlier, although it overlaps. \n \n Moreover, saying that you have a flawed conceptual framework and that one can't necessarily look at frozen blastocyst and tell whether or not it is revivable (assuming no further damage during thawing and no obviously lethal damage up to the present) is not equivalent to saying that there are no differences between between life and death. \n \n That being said, yes, life emerges from chemistry and physics and I view life to death as transitional - it can of course be extraordinarily abrupt, but there are stages between the two, and the point of transition has shifted over time with improvements in medical technology (e.g., shocking a heart back into action). However, recognition of a gradation between two end-member conditions does not deny that the end-members are different (black-white, or mixes of any pair of colors being examples). \n \n \n-- ridiculous, when obviously your example is not even a system, let alone a complex, dynamic, productive, and autopoietic system.\nA dead and decomposing body is no less a system than a live one. It is clearly a \"complex whole\", and since it is being digested by its own enzymes, it clearly exhibits interaction of parts. (Glaciers and rivers are also systems.) It is forming decomposition products, so it is productive. The reactions are complex, as it the body (getting less so, however). It changes during decomposition, so it's dynamic, after a fashion. This leaves us with \"autopoietic\", which I haven't so far discussed. \n \n You gave a definition for an autopoietic machine as \"An autopoietic machine is a machine organized (defined as a unity) as a network of processes of production (transformation and destruction) of components which: (i) through their interactions and transformations continuously regenerate and realize the network of processes (relations) that produced them; and (ii) constitute it (the machine) as a concrete unity in space in which they (the components) exist by specifying the topological domain of its realization as such a network.\" (Maturana, Varela, 1980, p. 78)\" \"\n \n I readily agree that (i) doesn't apply to corpses. However, (i) also doesn't seem to apply to frozen but revivable blastocysts, and (ii) seems to be a sufficiently impenetrable statement that it can apply to a corpse as easily to the aforementioned blastocyst. \n \n \n \n \nAnd I, and others before me, did not 'invent' Vitality, 'life force, 'elan vital', but 'recognised' it-- as the only way out of _your_ dilemma.\n \n Just as Newton invented Gravity in order to get materialists out of their dilemma, i.e., that they had no mechanical explanation for weight and the observed fact that apples fall out of trees without being pushed.\n\n Interesting point, because according to Newton, gravity is an actual force, whereas according to Einstein there is no such force, but it is instead merely a label for the effects of the curvature in space-time caused by mass. Vitalism in organic chemistry, ether, and phlogistons were similarly 'recognized' due to the need that was felt for them.

This the argument that we have been going over and over and over, despite the fact, as I've already pointed out to you, quantum mechanics shows that indivisible continuums are a materialist fantasy--that all of existence is 'chopped up' into 'quanta'.\n \n \n Not true. You never actually speak to/address/argue my \"concepts\" at all. You merely gainsay, deny, and scoff at them. You try to obfuscate any lines of discussion I open wrt to the issues. One example being your attempt to obscure an inquiry into empirically observable 'signs of life' by pretending that the chemical phenomena found to be acting upon a corpse are indistinguishable from the chemical phenomena found to be acting within a live organism. \" \n \n wells--\n Mike, I critiqued a specific part of your definition by saying that your specific use, without qualification, of inherent dynamism and motion as ways to distinguish a volitional system fom a non-volitional one aren't good, because dead corpses can be fairly dynamic, and frozen revivable blastocysts are not.\n\n \n **\n Not true, neil. What you really did was try to blow smoke, obfuscate, by falsely conflating that which is done, dynamically, _to_ a dead organism, with that which is done, dynamically, _by_ a live organism. The metaphysical assumption being that since chemistry is only chemistry, it makes no difference where you find it--its orgins and agents are irrelevent. Which is pure hooey, in biology. \n \n \n\n They fall on the wrong sides of the definitional fence that you wish to erect between life and death. Post-mortem changes begin with processes that are going on within the living body (but uncontrolled and unbalanced), and as time passes they shift to include new factors and new processes as time goes by, so I haven't disputed that a decomposing body is doing different things from a live one.\n\n \n **\n No, what you've done is, as above, told the lie that a dead body is \"doing things\", when in fact it is only \"having things done to it\". There is a distinct difference between what a system does, and that which may be done to a system, and you deliberartely tried to blur, obscure, and hide that distinction.\n And you are still implying that same falsehood when you say--\"a decomposing body is doing different things from a live one\".\n \n \n \n\n I said that you can't set the fence simply at the presence vs the absence of \"inherent dynamism and motion\" and get the corpse and the revivable frozen blastocysts on the appropriate sides for your argument, because the corpse is more inherently dynamic and mobile than the blastocyst.\n\n \n **\n Which is totally ridiculous, since the corpse, pe se, is totally passive, not \"inherently dynamic\", and is 'doing' nothing but being operated upon external agents and chemical agencies. Next you'll be telling us that a dead man is \"inherently dynamic and mobile\", just as a living person is--at least for as long as its in the back of a hearse, on it's way to the graveyard.\n \n Why are you clinging to this absurd objection? Do you actually believe it holds merit?\n \n \n\n Secondly, I think your insistence that organisms have to be either alive or dead is misguided, because suspended animation / deep freezing are neither the one nor the other, and because you have problems separating \"dead-frozen\" from \"live but frozen\" (without thawing and finding out what happens).\n\n \n **\n Once again you speak not from empirical observation but from metaphysical presumption. That is, you deny that there is a real and distinct difference beteen 'live' and 'dead'. You say that my insistence [that organisms be either the one or the other], is \"false\", since, in your materialist world of unbroken continuums, there is no point at which the one may be distinguished as distinct from the other. A point of view, as I pointed out on other occasions, that originated with the early greek materialists, and which resulted in their materialist dictum that 'change' is merely an illusion. [see Parmenides, Thales, Zeno, et al]. So that, in your view, the change from 'alive' to 'dead' is also illusory, since, in your materialist view, there exists no point at which the one is distinct from the other. Therefore you assume that a deep-frozen blastocyst may be neither one nor the other, or both at the same time, like Shrodinger's gedanken cat.\n \n \n\n This is not quite your option C / Shroedinger's cat model, as I explained earlier, although it overlaps. \n\n \n **\n What \"explanation\"? All you've said to that effect is to make a non-explanatory assertion that--\n \"My view is close to the first part of your option C (a previously living and so far undamaged blastocyst is neither dead nor alive while frozen). However, the outcome is deterministic (albeit very hard to predict), depending on the lack of damage done during freezing and thawing, up to the reastablishment(sic) of conditions that allow metabolism to restart.\"---\n \n The \"outcome\" of changing the the state \"frozen blastocyst\" to that of \"thawed blastocyst\" is a separate issue from the issue in question, which is, I remind you, the question of whether or not a frozen blastocyst is in a 'live' state, a 'dead' state', 'neither', or 'both'. Which itself arises out of the issue as to whether or not one can empirically discern the 'live' state, which is itself a related issue, without being the same issue; unless you adopt the materialist position that anything that cannot be empirically discerned, directly or indirectly, is by that token, 'supernatural', hence, 'unreal'.\n \n In short, you voiced your opinion, which you are perfectly right to do, but you offered no 'explanation' for it.\n \n \n\n Moreover, saying that you have a flawed conceptual framework and that one can't necessarily look at frozen blastocyst and tell whether or not it is revivable (assuming no further damage during thawing and no obviously lethal damage up to the present) is not equivalent to saying that there are no differences between between life and death.\n\n \n **\n If you believe that, then why did you raise the objection to my assertion, that is, that there are real differences between life and death? Why did you bring up corpses and frozen blastocysts at all, if not to deny that assertion and to obfuscate the issue?\n \n And how does that denial and obfuscation demonstrate that my assertion represents \"a flawed conceptual framework\"? There is no 'flaw' in my 'conceptual framework', i.e., the premise that 'life' and 'death' are distinctly different from each other, and not, as per your own, 'conceptual framework', merely a chemical continuum of one 'state' that merely moves from one 'stage' [life] to another 'stage', [death], so that any difference between life and death is illusory rather than real. You sound more like a creationist every day, you know that?\n \n \n\n That being said, yes, life emerges from chemistry and physics\n\n \n **\n \"Emerges\" is a lovely word, but if you insist that 'life' needs only \"chemistry and physics\" in order to \"emerge\", then you violate \"ex nihilo, ab nihilo, nihil fit\", and superstitiously appeal to the 'magick' of 'spontaneous generation'. Funny how quickly you materialists abandon logic, reason, and science just as soon as you need to do so. Magic words just won't cut it around here. You use a term, you justify it, logically and/or empirically, just as I do with Vitality, or you get justifiably scoffed at, as I do not.\n \n \n \n\n and I view life to death as transitional - it can of course be extraordinarily abrupt, but there are stages between the two, and the point of transition has shifted over time with improvements in medical technology (e.g., shocking a heart back into action).\n\n \n **\n So what? All you are trying to do is obfuscate the point at which there is a definite and distinct rupture between 'live' and 'dead'. If you admit to the existence of that point, then all the rest of this is just an arm-waving waste of time. But if, as you do here, you insist that there are \"non-life, non-death\" 'stages' _between_ actual 'life' and 'death' states, and so no clear distinction between life and death exists, then you'd best find some way to support that materialist metaphysical postulate [see above].\n \n \n\n However, recognition of a gradation between two end-member conditions does not deny that the end-members are different (black-white, or mixes of any pair of colors being examples). \n\n \n **\n There you go again with Zeno's paradoxes, claiming that there is no such thing as black or white, just different stages or 'degrees' of a single state, 'grey', with black and white as its 'end-members'. \n This time you are trying to 'reverse-engineer' life and death into a variatian of the 'sorites paradox', sometimes called the 'heap' or 'pile' paradox. This requires reducing an empirical state to an abstract value judgement, by simple declaration. A 'heap' is not a heap, empirically speaking, but is a 'heap' simply as a value judgement. WRT to 'heaps' and 'piles' and other vague quantifications, where quantities of something can be somewhat 'more' or somewhat 'less' ,without affecting what that something is, this is true.\n But Life is a state of being, not a quantity something measurable, like peas or pigment. Just like pregnancy, where you either are pregnant or you're not, you either are alive or you're not. You cannot try on a sorites paradox in order to pretend that the only distinction between life and death is a semantic one, because life cannot be quantified--it is, or it is not.\n \n You, as a materialist, are trying to turn life into something that can be quantified, and thus measured, because for a materialist if a thing can't be measured, then it can be disregarded; in fact, _must_ be disregarded. If you can't say that 'this' is more [or less] alive than 'that', by a degree or two, then you just don't want to hear about it.\n \n Quote:\n ww-\n \"-- ridiculous, when obviously your example is not even a system, let alone a complex, dynamic, productive, and autopoietic system. \"\n \n A dead and decomposing body is no less a system than a live one.[/quote]\n \n **\n That is quite possibly the dumbest thing you've ever said. Next you'll be telling us that stick of burning stove wood constitutes 'a system'. and that the field that snow drops upon is no less a 'system'!!\n \n \n\n It is clearly a \"complex whole\",\n\n \n **\n How is it a _complex_ whole? Is a hamburger patty, in the pan or not, a 'complex' thing? There is nothing complex about a corpse. It's either a corpse, or it isn't. If you want talk about the dynamic complexities of what is being done _to_ the corpse by things that are not the corpse, flail away, but it's a red herring.\n \n \n\n and since it is being digested by its own enzymes, it clearly exhibits interaction of parts.\n\n \n **\n Since when are simple chemical reactions sufficient to characterize a 'system'?\n Since you apparently have no idea just what the word, 'system' means, here it is again, one more time. Even though if you didn't 'get it' the first hundred times, you won't accept it this time, either--\n \n \"sys\u00b7tem (s&#301;s't&#601;m) \n n.\n A group of interacting, interrelated, or interdependent elements forming a complex whole.\n A functionally related group of elements, especially:\n The human body regarded as a functional physiological unit.\n An organism as a whole, especially with regard to its vital processes or functions.\n A group of physiologically or anatomically complementary organs or parts: the nervous system; the skeletal system.\n A group of interacting mechanical or electrical components.\n A network of structures and channels, as for communication, travel, or distribution.\n A network of related computer software, hardware, and data transmission devices.\n An organized set of interrelated ideas or principles.\n A social, economic, or political organizational form.\n A naturally occurring group of objects or phenomena: the solar system.\n A set of objects or phenomena grouped together for classification or analysis.\n A condition of harmonious, orderly interaction.\n An organized and coordinated method; a procedure. See synonyms at method.\n The prevailing social order; the establishment. Used with the: You can't beat the system.\" [answers.com]\n \n Where in any of this do you find the simple chemical act of 'enzymes breaking down proteins' qualifying as a 'system'?\n \n \n \n \n\n (Glaciers and rivers are also systems.)\n\n \n **\n Drainage systems and solar systems qualify as simple systems of interacting elements/parts forming interdependent wholes. Enzymes at work do not. \n Neither is painting a barn door a 'system', nor filling a cup with water a 'system'. Everything you can think of does not necessarily constitute a 'system', even when it is a part of a real system. Why do you keep forcing me to belabour the obvious?\n \n \n\n It is forming decomposition products, so it is productive.\n\n \n **\n Yeah, the enzymes are changing organic materials. So if you want to characterize enzymic action as 'productive', go ahead. But enzymes are not systems, and neither are corpses, and neither are enzymes acting on corpses.\n \n And if you want to define any outcome as a 'product', and so stretch the meaning of the word 'productive' to include any activity that leads to any outcome, that would be perfectly in keeping with the materialist worldview described above. I prefer to limit the meaning of 'productive' as that which leads, teleologically, to a desired outcome;-- at least when talking of complex systems, like live organisms, and not just simple events, like enzymic action or glaciers melting or rain falling or wind blowing the leaves around.\n \n \n\n The reactions are complex, as it the body (getting less so, however). It changes during decomposition, so it's dynamic, after a fashion. This leaves us with \"autopoietic\", which I haven't so far discussed.\n\n \n **\n If you still haven't realized that you are only playing semantic games, allow me to once again point this out to you.\n \n \n\n You gave a definition for an autopoietic machine as \"An autopoietic machine is a machine organized (defined as a unity) as a network of processes of production (transformation and destruction) of components which: (i) through their interactions and transformations continuously regenerate and realize the network of processes (relations) that produced them; and (ii) constitute it (the machine) as a concrete unity in space in which they (the components) exist by specifying the topological domain of its realization as such a network.\" (Maturana, Varela, 1980, p. 78)\" \"\n\n \n **\n That is Maturana and Varela's definition of an autopoietic machine. I cannot speak for them, but I define a live organism as an autopoietic system, and not as an autopoietic \"machine\", at all. Why? Because I define a 'machine' as an artefact, an artificial system, as contrasted to a natural system. I quoted them solely to illustrate the meaning of 'autopoietic', whether applied to artificial machine systems, or natural organismic systems. Personally, I think that they are wrong to apply the term 'autopoietic' to machinery, because by definition a machine is a tool, and by definition, no tool can be autopoietic, because by definition tools serve others, not themselves. As do all artefacts.\n The essence of autopoiesis, IMO, is serving the self as an identified entity. Withjout a sense of identity, nothing can be autopoietic. And before you leap to anthropomorphic conclusions, 'identity' need be nothing more than the unconscious ability to distinguish 'self' from 'not-self'; that is, to simply be aware. \n \n \n\n I readily agree that (i) doesn't apply to corpses. However, (i) also doesn't seem to apply to frozen but revivable blastocysts, and (ii) seems to be a sufficiently impenetrable statement that it can apply to a corpse as easily to the aforementioned blastocyst. \n\n \n **\n Well, rather than defend their definition of an 'autopoietic machine', I will offer a definition of an autopoietic system. I will define an autopoietic system as any natural, complex system whose inherent internal activities serve the purpose of maintaining, enhancing, and if possible, expanding, the existence of that system, both within itself as an independent system, and/or overall, as a contributing internal sub-system within a greater uber-system. The least autopoietic system being a single cell, the greatest autopoietic uber-system being the biosphere.\n \n That's off the top of my head, but it will do for now.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:ww\n \"And I, and others before me, did not 'invent' Vitality, 'life force, 'elan vital', but 'recognised' it-- as the only way out of _your_ dilemma.\n \n Just as Newton invented Gravity in order to get materialists out of their dilemma, i.e., that they had no mechanical explanation for weight and the observed fact that apples fall out of trees without being pushed. \" \n wells--\n Interesting point, because according to Newton, gravity is an actual force, whereas according to Einstein there is no such force, but it is instead merely a label for the effects of the curvature in space-time caused by mass. \n\n \n **\n If that were what Einstein actually said then he would have done nothing more than change the name/label of the causal force from 'gravity' to 'mass'.\n \n \n\n Vitalism in organic chemistry, ether, and phlogistons were similarly 'recognized' due to the need that was felt for them. You need to be sure that you are recognizing something that actually exists, rather than is just needed by your beliefs.\n\n \n **\n Remember that the next time you appeal to \"Natural Selection\", \"Random [but] Adaptive Genetic Mutation\", bottom-up \"emergence\", and on and on and on.",

I will define an autopoietic system as any natural, complex system whose inherent internal activities serve the purpose of maintaining, enhancing, and if possible, expanding, the existence of that system, both within itself as an independent system, and/or overall, as a contributing internal sub-system within a greater uber-system. The least autopoietic system being a single cell, the greatest autopoietic uber-system being the biosphere.\n Alright, that's a distinct improvement, and it satisfactorily avoids the corpse problem. However, why not include viruses as alive under this definition? (Everything else seems to be okay except possibly for \"complex\".) Seems a bit arbitrary. Also, I don't think you've resolved your frozen blastocyst problem yet, or at least you are sweeping the problems under the carpet of 'inherent'. \"Enhancing\" is a bit vague, and we'll overlook the minor difficulty that postmortem gas bloat technically constitutes an expansion. \n \n I am not conflating live and dead, not am I denying the difference between white and dark. I am noting that your earlier definitions fail to distinguish live and dead the way that you want them to, I am noting that boundaries are not necessarily sharp, and that the division that you wish to be dichotomous is not. Additionally, your assumptions and foundational beliefs have derailed you off into mysticism.\n \n A corpse is indeed a system, and it is way more structured than hamburger (at least for a while yet, and presuming it didn't become a corpse by falling into a macerator). Oceans and rivers are quite complex systems, as far as systems go: a lot of terabytes would be needed to provide a full representation of either.\n \n \nNext you'll be telling us that a dead man is \"inherently dynamic and mobile\", just as a living person is\n You just can't stop with what I said, but you have to keep on overreaching. Yes, a corpse is inherently dynamic, and farts, belches, and shudders are a form of movement. Unless you freeze it, dynamic change by breakdown is inevitable and inherent and not passive. I have explained that breakdown is going to start by the action of biological agents already in the body, so it's inherent and it is doing stuff to itself, but right from the onset of death the actions are unbalanced and incomplete relative to what happens in a live body, and pretty quickly other, external, factors step in, so I have never claimed that it is 'just like a living person'.\n \n \nThe metaphysical assumption being that since chemistry is only chemistry, it makes no difference where you find it--its orgins and agents are irrelevent. Which is pure hooey, in biology.\n Yes on the first sentence, but the \"hooey\" charge is unsupported and unsupportable. Organic chemistry such as the synthesis of urea works just fine without the addition of vitalism, and you are just trying to reinsert this mysticism at a different level. \n \n \nI remind you, the question of whether or not a frozen blastocyst is in a 'live' state, a 'dead' state', 'neither', or 'both'.\n Agreed. We can't empirically discern the difference without thawing. Your original definition fails to support the distinction that you would like to be made (revivable = alive, nonrevivable = dead). Also, frozen = neither (it's suspended animation), not both (i.e. not exactly a Shroedinger's cat situation). Also, supercooled is quite different from supernatural, thank you.\n \n \nMoreover, saying that you have a flawed conceptual framework and that one can't necessarily look at frozen blastocyst and tell whether or not it is revivable (assuming no further damage during thawing and no obviously lethal damage up to the present) is not equivalent to saying that there are no differences between between life and death.\n I agree. I'm not making the claim that there are no differences - I'm saying that your definition can't serve to make that distinction in all cases. \n \n \nIf you believe that, then why did you raise the objection to my assertion, that is, that there are real differences between life and death? Why did you bring up corpses and frozen blastocysts at all, if not to deny that assertion and to obfuscate the issue?\n Again, to tell you that your definition doesn't properly discriminate all cases, and that your basic assumptions are flawed and are blinding you about the true nature of the differences, which in turn makes you call on the equivalent of phlogistons and pulls you into mysticism.\n \n And how did the stuff that you posted at the top of this page back up your implication that Chemist was lying?",

We got into this mess because WW proposed a bad set of definitions that failed to distinguished corpses and dead frozen blastocysts from living things:\n\n \n **\n False. We got into this mess because neil wells rejected my claim that live organisms could be empirically differentiated from dead organisms on the basis of internal dynamics, namely autopoietic activity. Wells dragged in corpses and frozen blastocysts in order to back up his gainsaying. It is his customary deny/obfuscate approach to debate that has produced this mess.\n \n Whether or not the definition of volition I gave in post #12 {?} is perfect, there is certainly nothing there that corpses and frozen blastocysts can take away from it.\n \n \n\n he argued that volition = an inherent dynamism = live organisms, where dynamism = development or motion of a system. \n \n Quote:\n [From WW] I would define volition as an inherent dynamism, characteristic of autopoietic systems, i.e., live organisms.\n \n dynamism--A process or mechanism responsible for the development or motion of a system. answers.com\n \n That system which is intrinsically dynamic [self-controlled and self-serving] possesses volition. ...... \n \n \n\n \n **\n Truthfully, when put together properly, my proposition went thusly--- volition=inherent dynamism=autopoiesis= inherent development and/or productive activity generated endogenously by a complex self-serving system.\n \n \n\n WW, with a newer definition of autopoiesis: \n Quote:\n Well, rather than defend their definition of an 'autopoietic machine', I will offer a definition of an autopoietic system. I will define an autopoietic system as any natural, complex system whose inherent internal activities serve the purpose of maintaining, enhancing, and if possible, expanding, the existence of that system, both within itself as an independent system, and/or overall, as a contributing internal sub-system within a greater uber-system. The least autopoietic system being a single cell, the greatest autopoietic uber-system being the biosphere. \n \n Alright, that's a distinct improvement,\n\n \n **\n Actually, it is only a longer, more detailed way of expressing exactly what I had said in the first place.\n \n \n\n and it satisfactorily avoids the corpse problem.\n\n \n **\n Oh, puhleeze give it up!! There never was a \"corpse problem\", except in your own head.\n \n \n\n However, why not include viruses as alive under this definition? (Everything else seems to be okay except possibly for \"complex\".) Seems a bit arbitrary.\n\n \n **\n True. And I do not have a final answer to the objection, but I would suggest that viruses do not possess the autonomy required of an auotopoietic system, because they are entirely dependent upon the dynamics of another system, a cell, in order to generate for them the sole and only 'product' they can be said to have--more viruses. Further, an autopoietic system is complex and dynamic to the point that it requires internal behaviour, metabolism, in order to maintain itself as it is. To my knowledge, viruses do not take in energy and metabolise it in order to maintain themselves, but passively, chemically, hang together or entropically disintegrate, as external forces dictate. Just like solar systems, for example, which are also non-autopoietic mechanical systems.\n \n \n\n Also, I don't think you've resolved your frozen blastocyst problem yet, or at least you are sweeping the problems under the carpet of 'inherent'.\n\n \n **\n Denial and automatic gainsaying are not counter-argument, neil. When are you going to accept that? \n \n Tell us clearly and cleanly just what \"problem\" you created for me with your \"frozen blastocyst\". Tell us how a frozen blastocyst makes my approach to volition [as autopoiesis] untenable. Try, if it is at all possible for you to do so, to avoid trying for cheap debating points by insinuating that your opponent, myself, is \"sweeping [your denial] under the carpet\", despite the fact that anyone can read the earlier posts and see that I have responded to your gainsaying and semantic gymnastics as reasonably and fully as it is possible to respond to such stuff.\n \n \n\n \"Enhancing\" is a bit vague, and we'll overlook the minor difficulty that postmortem gas bloat technically constitutes an expansion. \n\n \n **\n What difficulty? What does post-mortem gas bloat have to do with anything at all?!?! Are you still trying to find some way of turning decaying corpses into autopoietic systems? You are amazingly obdurate.\n \n \n\n I am not conflating live and dead, not am I denying the difference between white and dark. I am noting that your earlier definitions fail to distinguish live and dead the way that you want them to,\n\n \n **\n Only in your own unsupported opinion. You're entitled to that opinion, and I'm entitled to dismiss it as meritless, since you cannot, and do not, do anything more than repeat it.\n \n Moreover, my \"earlier\" definition is one and the same with my present definition. If you really see any essential change in my position, don't just insinuate that there is one, spell it out.\n \n \n\n I am noting that boundaries are not necessarily sharp, and that the division that you wish to be dichotomous is not.\n\n \n **\n Sez u. Ho hum.\n \n \n\n Additionally, your assumptions and foundational beliefs have derailed you off into mysticism.\n\n \n **\n Sez u. Ho hum.\n \n \n\n A corpse is indeed a system,\n\n \n **\n Haw! You are a laff a minute, neil. A corpse, in se, is not, by itserlf alone, a system. Start including all the bacteria, maggots, worms, gravitational pulls, weathering forces, moulds, yeasts, internal acids and enzymes,and carrion eaters, and you'll get an a corpse that has become part of a small ecosystem; but only a part--not a system. One cog in the machinery. Certainly it will not be in any way autopoietic; not as I have always defined autopoietic,[see above], and that's all that matters.\n \n \n\n and it is way more structured than hamburger (at least for a while yet, and presuming it didn't become a corpse by falling into a macerator). Oceans and rivers are quite complex systems, as far as systems go: a lot of terabytes would be needed to provide a full representation of either.\n\n \n **\n All of which is impertinent obfuscation of the issue. Ho hum.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Next you'll be telling us that a dead man is \"inherently dynamic and mobile\", just as a living person is \n \n You just can't stop with what I said, but you have to keep on overreaching.\n\n \n **\n What you call, 'overreaching', is called, 'reductio ad absurdum', in logic.\n \n \n\n Yes, a corpse is inherently dynamic, and farts, belches, and shudders are a form of movement.\n\n \n **\n Bloody nonsense. Gasses produced by decay, and the farts, belches and shudders produced by those gasses, are produced by dynamic bacteria, etc., not by the passive dead meat they are devouring and metabolizing. Are you always this obtuse when it comes to determining cause and effect? Or are you deliberately distorting the mechanics of organic decay?\n \n \n \n\n Unless you freeze it, dynamic change by breakdown is inevitable and inherent and not passive.\n \n \n **\n Well, you could also salt it, smoke it, pickle it, or freeze-dry it;-- but never mind.\n The point is that both decay and preservation are thing done to a passive corpse, and not, as you seem to believe, dynamic things it does to itself.\n \n \n\n I have explained that breakdown is going to start by the action of biological agents already in the body, so it's inherent and it is doing stuff to itself, but right from the onset of death the actions are unbalanced and incomplete relative to what happens in a live body, and pretty quickly other, external, factors step in, so I have never claimed that it is 'just like a living person'.\n\n \n **\n You try to confuse the issue by pretending that, since enzymes and other chemicals do the same thing they always do, whether or not they are contained within a live organism or a dead one, that there is therefore no distinction between the dynamic action of an enzyme working for, as a component of, an autopoietic system, and the dynamic action of an enzyme working on a corpse, and so, according to your voodoo logic, a corpse is no different from an autopoietic, self-serving, self-sustaining system. And despite the stupidity of this contention, you simply cannot let it go. \n \n \n\n Quote:\n The metaphysical assumption being that since chemistry is only chemistry, it makes no difference where you find it--its orgins and agents are irrelevent. Which is pure hooey, in biology. \n \n Yes on the first sentence, but the \"hooey\" charge is unsupported and unsupportable. Organic chemistry such as the synthesis of urea works just fine without the addition of vitalism,\n\n \n **\n Non sequitur. And a distortion. I did not say, as you assert, that chemistry is different depending upon where you find it. I said that, contrary to your POV, that it makes a difference to science where you find it. That is, that its orgins and agents and whereabouts--that is, the overall context in which the particular chemistry is examined and assessed-- matters; and matters a lot, in some cases.\n \n \n\n and you are just trying to reinsert this mysticism at a different level. \n\n \n **\n Sez u. Ho hum. But of course, to a materialist such as yourself, anything that you can't reduce to 'stuff bumping into other stuff, pointlessly', has to be labelled, 'mysticism'.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n I remind you, the question of whether or not a frozen blastocyst is in a 'live' state, a 'dead' state', 'neither', or 'both'. \n \n Agreed. We can't empirically discern the difference without thawing.\n\n \n **\n Maybe we can, maybe we can't, --yet. I don't know that we cannot do it it today; I simply have not found material on the subject, What good reason do you have to support a claim that it is, now and forever, simply impossible to empirically discern such a difference? If we truly cannot do it today, I can think of no reason for that failure other than the lack of the proper tools to do the job. You seem to be making a metaphysical assertion that we cannot observe any differences [if that is true], because there are no differences to be observed, and so at certain temperatures there are no differences between the living and the dead, and life and death are become the same thing.\n \n \n\n Your original definition\n\n \n **\n Stop with the oblique references to some \"original definition\"--my one definition is what it has always been. If you think I had an 'original' definition that is in some essential way altered in some 'later' definition, prove it. State these 'definitions' plainly and show where they differ from each other in any non-trivial sense.\n \n \n\n fails to support the distinction that you would like to be made (revivable = alive, nonrevivable = dead).\n\n \n **\n That's not \"the distinction that {I} would like to be made\", but it certainly is a distinction that can be, and is, made. And made everyday, in operating rooms and elsewhere.\n \n \n\n Also, frozen = neither (it's suspended animation),\n\n \n **\n Sez u. A metaphysical assumption on your part.\n \n \n\n not both (i.e. not exactly a Shroedinger's cat situation). \n\n \n **\n As above.\n \n \n\n Also, supercooled is quite different from supernatural, thank you.\n\n \n **\n Not in your books, apparently. In youyr reality, 'supercooled' is a third, supernatural state, distinct from the two natural states, 'alive' and 'dead'.\n \n \n\n I'm not making the claim that there are no differences - I'm saying that your definition can't serve to make that distinction in all cases. \n\n \n **\n Why not?\n \n \n\n Quote:\n If you believe that, then why did you raise the objection to my assertion, that is, that there are real differences between life and death? Why did you bring up corpses and frozen blastocysts at all, if not to deny that assertion and to obfuscate the issue? \n \n Again, to tell you that your definition doesn't properly discriminate all cases, and that your basic assumptions are flawed and are blinding you about the true nature of the differences, which in turn makes you call on the equivalent of phlogistons and pulls you into mysticism.\n\n \n **\n Again, this stuff doesn't \"tell\" anybody anything except that it is your opinion that such is so. At no time did any of this protracted corpse junk, or the 'frozen stiff' stuff, demonstrate that my definition of volition and its relation to life itself is in any way flawed, despite your repeated claim. You have never shown that it does not \"properly discriminate\", you have only asserted that it does not. You claim that my \"basic assumptions are flawed\", but you never prove it. You claim that I am \"blind to the true nature of the differences\", without even attempting to stipulate just what those 'true differences' are. And then, just to play the sophist game, you pretend that that I resort to mysticism', simply because anything you cannot get to fit into your materialist metaphysics you wave off and disparage as 'mysticism'. Wewll, here's a flash for you--the stuff you've been spouting here has a lot more in common with 'mysticism' than my ideas have. \n \n \n\n And how did the stuff that you posted at the top of this page back up your implication that Chemist was lying? \n\n \n **\n Think about it, why don't you?",

If you do have genes for eyes then you may have an eye (or two or even 10) but your environment may not allow those genes to be expressed.

Centralized nervous systems came pretty late in the game. Bacteria do not think, plants do not think, and intelligence as its generally used means that thinking takes place.

Good luck with that!\n \n Note well that is the way reality would have to be IF your theory is to be workable! Thats a very very weak concept is it not? That a nucleotide can think?

A couple of points do stand out though.\n \n In most of the examples given, the nature of the effect of 'free will' upon the phenotype is unrelated to the behaviour itself. Grandsons developing diabetes because their grandfathers pigged out in their youth is all very interesting, but it's not exactly a sterling example of volition and evolution working hand in glove, is it? And the agouti mice, whose phenotype was 'fixed' by a methyl-rich diet - one might equally well say that they are genetically unsuited to a methyl-sparse diet; one step down the food chain from Pottenger's cats. So sure, the decisions you make about what to eat and how you behave can potentially influence the phenotype of your offspring - but there's no indication that the effect will, in the general case, be responsive (ie, useful and applicable) to the choice you made. Skimp on folic acid during pregnancy and your children don't emerge better at doing without folic acid; they just have a greater chance of Downs Syndrome.\n \n Also, this is hardly 'introducing' free will to genetics. Heck, I myself have described several ways in which free will can indirectly influence the course of evolution: the choice to migrate to new environments, the choice to adopt new behaviour, the choice to prize certain qualities above others when selecting a mate - these volitional acts and more can alter the phenotypic fitness landscape and nudge evolution in new directions.\n \n Evidence of plastic, environmentally sensitive phenotypes is not evidence of the particular kind of environmentally-steered evolution you want to see. Good examples for you are those moths we were talking about, where the plasticity is adaptive and useful at both environmental extremes. But every time you post a link to a phenotypic sensitivity that has a potentially detrimental effect (eg the sickliness of Agouti mice on a methyl-sparse diet, the sickliness of cats on a taurine-deficient diet), you're undermining your own position. You're pointing out situations where phenotypic plasticity is harmful to the organism.",

Think of the epigenome as a complex software code, capable of inducing the DNA hardware to manufacture an impressive variety of proteins, cell types, and individuals\n\n \n Bertvan: The message is not the medium in which it is conveyed. The message itself is immaterial. The message may be conveyed by DNA molecules, but the \"Instructions\" are immaterial. Intelligence as an aspect of reality is a different way of looking at things. Materialists are within their right to hope that someday a mechanical explanation of how the environment might directly interact with the genome (no intelligence involved} to cause epigenetic phenomena, but that is promissory materialism. In the meantime non materialists are also within their right to see intelligent organization, organization that is in purposeful response to the environment as an intrinsic aspect of living systems.\n \n \n The even greater surprise is the recent discovery that epigenetic signals from the environment can be passed on from one generation to the next, sometimes for several generations, without changing a single gene sequence. It\\'s well established, of course, that environmental effects like radiation, which alter the genetic sequences in a sex cell\\'s DNA, can leave a mark on subsequent generations. Likewise, it\\'s known that the environment in a mother\\'s womb can alter the development of a fetus. What\\'s eye-opening is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the epigenetic changes wrought by one\\'s diet, behavior, or surroundings can work their way into the germ line and echo far into the future. Put simply, and as bizarre as it may sound, what you eat or smoke today could affect the health and behavior of your great-grandchildren.\n\n \n Bertvan: Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis is the concept that organisms, not their genomes, have limited ability to adapt intelligently and purposefully to environmental change. Such adaptations are inherited epigenetically, and only become encoded into the genome if persistent over generations. Religion has nothing to do with a concept, which is perfectly compatible with either theism or agnosticism. \n \n \nEpigenetics introduces the concept of free will into our idea of genetics.\"\n \n Such results hint at a seemingly anti-Darwinian aspect of heredity.\n",

Religion has nothing to do with a concept, which is perfectly compatible with either theism or agnosticism.\n\n \n Unfortunately, there is no evidence for this concept. Although many organisms do adapt to their local environments, such adaptability evolved by Darwnian mechanisms. Second, even among those organisms that do adapt to different environments, there is no evidence such adaptability is the result of intelligence.\n \n Finally, there is no such thing as a Darwinian concept of heredity. Darwin had no valid concept of heredity. If some aspects of heredity turn out to be epigenetic as opposed to genetic, that in no way refutes Darwinian theory, which postulates descent with modification.\n \n I have no idea why epigenetic groupies have it in for Darwin so much, but they exaggerate his demise just as much as the loony Creationists.",

   "No scientists anywhere claim or support the notion that any organism can alter their own DNA. Human\\'s might be able to one day by gene therapy, but that is through use of advanced technology. Epigenetics does not mean anything to do with the genomes themselves. Only the arrangement and storage of DNA as a chemical. There is often confusion with conditions or diseases that aren\\'t genetic but are still hereditary. This is, however, just a misunderstanding.\n \n There is no reason why genetics should arise in a debate about free-will, as free-will and it\\'s existence would be decided by something more fundamental, physics.\n \n Free-will\\'s existance could be argued equally well in both directions by application of physics. As we could, with a powerful enough computer, map the interactions of all the atoms in the universe, we could predict people\\'s future actions, thus removing free will. BUT, we could never measure the movement of atoms to that degree of accuracy due to the uncertainty principle, so free will remains. In my view, as long as there is such a thing as consciousness, then there is free-will to all intents and purposes.",
