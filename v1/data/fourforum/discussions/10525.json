   "Bill Maher: Christians have neurological disorder\n Says parents 'drill' religion into kids' heads using biblical 'fairy tales'\n Posted: February 18, 2005\n 1:00 a.m. Eastern\n \n \n \u00a9 2005 WorldNetDaily.com\n \n \n Bill Maher\n \n Television personality Bill Maher, host of HBO's \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" says Christians and others who are religious suffer from a neurological disorder that \"stops people from thinking.\"\n \n Appearing as a guest on MSNBC's \"Scarborough Country\" this week, Maher told host Joe Scarborough:\n \n \"We are a nation that is unenlightened because of religion. I do believe that. I think that religion stops people from thinking. I think it justifies crazies. I think flying planes into a building was a faith-based initiative. I think religion is a neurological disorder. If you look at it logically, it's something that was drilled into your head when you were a small child. It certainly was drilled into mine at that age. And you really can't be responsible when you are a kid for what adults put into your head.\"\n \n The former host of \"Politically Incorrect\" said the lack of enlightenment of so many Americans means the nation actually has more in common with its enemies than one might think.\n \n Said Maher: \"When you look at beliefs in such things as, do you go to heaven, is there a devil, we have more in common with Turkey and Iran and Syria than we do with European nations and Canada and nations that, yes, I would consider more enlightened than us.\"\n \n Maher explained that he was not singling out evangelicals, but was targeting all \"religious\" people.\n \n \"I think the vote in Missouri [rejecting same-sex marriage] and a lot of other states is because people are religious,\" Maher said. \"They don't have to be evangelical, but they're religious. They believe in religion, which as - I think it was Jesse Ventura who had that quote about religion is a crutch for weak-minded people who need strength in numbers.\"\n \n The television host told Scarborough he was convinced evangelicals' influence will wane.\n \n Said Maher: \"When people say to me, 'You hate America,' I don't hate America. I love America. I am just embarrassed that it has been taken over by people like evangelicals, by people who do not believe in science and rationality. It is the 21st century. And I will tell you, my friend. The future does not belong to the evangelicals. The future does not belong to religion.\"\n \n Later in the interview, Maher returned to the childhood-religion theme, comparing fairy tales to Bible stories:\n \n \"When you were a kid and they were telling you whatever you believe in religion, do you think if they had switched the fairy tales that they read to you in bed with the Bible, you would know the difference?\n \n \"Do you think if it was the fairy tale about a man who lived inside of a whale and it was religion that Jack built a beanstalk today, you would know the difference? Why do you believe in one fairy tale and not the other? Just because adults told you it was true and they scared you into believing it, at pain of death, at pain of burning in hell.",

   "Did Saul ask to be knocked down and blinded.\n \n \n Do you know what Sauls prayer life was like ? How do you know that as he spent long hours riding and walking between towns praying to God, and due to a spiritual conviction for hunting down followers of Christ that he didn't ask God to confirm for him that he was doing His Will ? So although God wasn't responding to a direct request by Saul to knock him down and blind him, I firmly believe he was responding to his request to reveal His will for Sauls life.\n \n \nWould not asking presume someone is listening?\n \n \n When I asked God to reveal Himself to me if He really exists, I had absolutely no personal knowledge or assurance at all that He did exist. I remember having a sense of dread that no God exists at all. But I hungered to know the truth and He revealed Himself to me. It took 7 years to get through to me, but by 22 I got the message.\n \n \nAnd could not any event that transpires next be inferred to be an affirmative response.\n\n \n That wasn't my experience at all. And if God is truly God then He knows how to reach you so that you will know it's coming from Him. He has no desire to play games with your soul. \n \n \nI don't think you mean that I should hear a voice, do you?\n\n \n Not at all.

Since being born again I have known that voice within me to be the Holy Spirit of God which indwells all believers. \n \n \nDo you see the logical disconnect?

If that is the definition then I was an atheist because I had no belief, knowledge or evidence at all that God existed. I just know that it was the driving question in my life because I firmly believed, or inherantly understood that if God didn't exist then neither did absolute truth. And sure enough, when I found the living God, I found absolute truth. :) Praise be to God almighty...",

   "Intelligently refuting my arguments doesn't bother me, but the blatant ignorance you constantly spew isn't worth responding to anymore.\n\n \n And how is my point ignorant? Merely saying it is and then refusing to back up your post only shows that you don't have the intelligence or maturity to deal with it. If it was truly as you say it was, you would be able to set out a argument showing that in was indeed as you say it is: \"blatant ignorance.\" Now as history has shown, you won't do this. Thus I can only conclude that your statement is just a cover for your lack of skill and reason and thus my posts are not ignorant at all.\n \n I noticed from several threads that you can't prove your God exists. Therefore what makes your God true opposed to the several hundred in the list I provided? \n \n Furthermore, I asked you this before and you just ignored it, what makes your 'experience' from god any different then a LSD user saying he experienced God and talked to him? or Bin Laden for that matter? \n \n I know you don't care about people refuting you. Hell we stopped making fun of you for your hoaxes because it didn't do anything. You just pretended that you never made the argument despite links to posts showing you did. It is as if you have a complete and absolute tolerance to being proven wrong. You could argue and believe that 2 + 2 = 67 and if we showed you two apples combined with two more apples you wouldn't care. \n \n All my post does is expand upon the mockery of your posts, notice I said posts, not arguments as what you provide does not match the basics to be considered an argument. \n \n And you run away from virtually every attack on your posts. Remember this post?\n \n Since you obviously don't put intelligence in your posts or care about it in posts against you, why do you keep running away?",
