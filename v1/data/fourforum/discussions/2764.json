   "Ok. It may be tough to find something that concisely refutes what he says because what he says is, well, quite stupid.\n \n In the mean time, the quick answer is that we don't run out of genes becasue genes are constantly being replaced. The most come reason that a gene \"goes away\" is that it has mutated into a new gene; thus, no decrease in total number of genes. Also, brand new genes are being created. This is from \"An Introduction to Genetic Analysis\", by Griffiths, Miller, Suzuki, Lewontin, and Gelbart. 7th edition. Chapter 26, page 792.\n \n If new functions are to arise in evolution without the sacrifice of previously existing functions, new DNA must be made availavle for the evolution of added genes. This new DNA may arise by duplication of the entire genome, polyploidy, followed by a slow evolutionary divergence of the extra chromosomal set. This has been a frequent occurance in plants. An alternative is the duplication of single genes followed by selection for differentiation. Yet another source of DNA, recently discovered, is the entry into the genome of DNA from totally unrelated organisms by infection followed by integration of the foreign DNA into the nuclear genome or by the formation of extranuclear cell organelles with tehir own genomes. Mitochondira dn chloroplasts in higher ogransims have arisem by this route.\n \n \n You may want to clean up the spelling if you want to repost that, I'm only a so so touch typer.

He kept arguing about how if evolution were correct, organisms would get too over-adapted to an environment, then die out.\n \n I agreed that sometimes, if a habitat disappeared too rapidly, and an organism was not suited for any particular adjacent habitats (as is happening with panda bears currently) the population of organisms could indeed go extinct. He seemed to think that in all cases, organisms would get overly adapted to a particular environment and eventually die out with changing conditions. I argued that conditions didn't always change so fast, and that not every organism that was adapted to a particular environment couldn't survive in a somewhat similar one.\n \n My only problem is that I don't have the best handle of genetics.

That did happen with a few creatures, and as we can see, they're endangered. But evolution isn't guided, it's random. Some creatures mutate quickly, some slowly. Some adapt to a very, very specific niche, others take a more \"generalist\" approach. Evolution doesn't \"try\" to make creatures fit their environment. Changes just happen, and some work better than others. If the change is to make the creature be very specifically adapted, then that actually tends to be a bad thing, which is why we don't see it that often.

In fact, natural selection is the evolutionary sieve. So who tried to use a misunderstood word? You or your opponent? If you did, you now know better.

It seems that he doesn't. The little two paragraph statement that you presented has nothing to do with genetics. It seems to be a case of a little knowledge being dangerous. He seems to equate the number of genes in an organism with the genetic diversity in a population. Not the same. Given some 30,000 genes with an average of 14 alleles per gene, we can expect considerable variation.\n \n Yes, there are mechanisms that tend to eliminate nonadaptive alleles. On the other hand, there are mechanisms that continue to inject new genetic possibilities into populations.\n \n Evolution does not equate to natural selection.

Could anyone give examples or discuss this point?\n\n \n \"based on the efficiency of translated proteins\" has no meaning for me. I know alot about genetics and evolution, and I've never come across that phrase. It sounds like he's trying to cover up a hole in an argument using techno-babble, and he's hoping you won't notice.\n \n In genetics, translation is the process of converting the nucleotide sequence of mRNA into a sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain. I'll expand on that, in case you're unfamiliar with this.\n \n We start with DNA, which is a sequence of nucleotides. To make a protein, the DNA \"unzips\", exposing a sequence of nucleotides which code for one or more proteins. That sequence is called a gene. In a process called transcription, RNA forms along the gene, forming a sort of negative image of the gene. The RNA then seperates from the DNA, and undergoes some editing (which we'll skip over here, since it's not really relevant). The cleaned up RNA then leaves the nucleus(assuming we're talking about cells with nucleuses), and is now called mRNA, for messenger RNA. The mRNA \"finds\" a ribosome, which uses the mRNA as a set of instructions for making a protein. Each set of three nucleotides in the mRNA is called a codon, and each codon codes for a specific amino acid. So, for each codon on the mRNA, an amino acid is added to the polypeptide chain that the ribosome is making, in a process called translation. When the mRNA is done, then the ribosome is finished, and the resulting protien is released.\n \n Based on this, I have no clue what \"efficiency of translated proteins\" is supposed to mean. I'd call him on it and say he's making it up, or at least has no clue what he's talking about.\n \n (Update)\n I just had my wife, who has studied microbiology (I'm just a very well read lay person) check your quote, and she says that without seeing more context, she would have to agree that the fragment is meaningless.",

   "\"how genetics affects underlying behavior, selection, or overall survival based on the efficiency of translated proteins.\"\n \n He wants YOU to explain this? Well, we all know that genes code for a specific protein. the proteins are translated on ribosomes using messenger RNA and transfer RNA that carries the amino acids to the ribosome to be assembled into a peptide. If there is a mutation in the gene, then the code will be altered and the protein MAY OR MAY NOT be altered. this MAY affect it's efficiency in that it MAY decrease it or increase it. But this would imply that a protein has only one function, which isn't the case for lots of proteins. Now, how something as simple (ha) as that permutes itself into a change in behavior or overall survival is beyond my knowledge. \n \n But, there are plenty of ineffecient proteins out there. The big one is RUBISCO, which is the carbon fixing enzyme that catalyzes the addition if CO2 to ribose biphosphate (the first step in the Calvin Cycle). Well, it's terribly inefficient because that reaction has such a high &#916;G. Anyway, here is some info.\n \n http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/molecules/pdb11_1.html\n http://www.marine.usf.edu/microbiology/RubisCO/rubisco.html\n http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/fo24_1/e1rxoe.htm\n \n Anyway, seeing that the smaller version in the blue-green algea is composed of the same types of subunits as the larger plant version points ME toward evolution.",
