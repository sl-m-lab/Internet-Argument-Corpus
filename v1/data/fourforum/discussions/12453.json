None of our business at all. \n \n However, what is clear is that you disarmed the law-abiding, leaving them totally defenseless, and totally dependent on your police for everything. I just thank God that your culture has a greater respect for human life, than ours. Australia too.\n \n However, gun control is NOT crime control, and that should be noted. \n \n Drug dealers already import illegal products. Adding guns to the list would only mean just one more new illegal revenue stream for them, supplying guns to criminals. If gun control severe as yours or Australia's were done here, gangs like MS 13, The Crypts and the Bloods would have a field day, and run many neighborhoods into the ground. Who could stop them? They surely have no English or Australian moral dilemma to overcome. They have absolutely no problem killing anyone! \n \n But again, gun control is NOT crime control! Your violent crime rate is higher than most, and even higher than our violent crime rate ever since your gun bans started. Even with our high Inner City murder rate. And I say that not to condemn anyone. That is just a fact.",

   "The vast majority of gun crime victims in this country are under 21, is anyone seriously proposing that 18 and 19 year olds (and younger?) be allowed to carry guns in public?\n\n \n THEY ARE ANYWAY! What don't you understand about criminals? THEY IGNORE THE LAW! They DO NOT CARE what you say about \"allowing\" them to carry. THEY ARE ANYWAY.\n \n How many times do we have to say, \"CRIMINALS DO NOT FOLLOW THE LAW\". Yet you can only talk about passing more laws like it will have some effect on the criminals instead of the LAW ABIDING PEOPLE who follow it!\n \n \nThe vast majority of gun crime victims in this country are under 21\n\n \n It's against the law to KILL PEOPLE. What makes you think that if you pass some law banning guns, the criminals will suddenly stop packing when they already ignore the one about MURDER?\n \n Tim: \"Hey, Mike. I'm going to go down to the local Git-n-Go and shoot everyone I see with this gun I stole.\"\n \n Mike: \"Aren't you only 17, Tim?\"\n \n Tim: \"Yeah.

It's against the law for persons under 18 to be in possession of a handgun.\"\n \n Tim: \"Gee, Mike. I guess you're right. I shouldn't have taken it when I burglarized that house last night since it's illegal for me to posess a handgun. I should probably wait until I can legally obey the gun laws before I go on a killing spree.\"\n \n Well? That's your whole argument.",

The yobs and yardies pretty much own all of Britain now, because they can kill as they please and not face any opposition from their victims.\n\n I saw this 2007 article doing a search for gangs here in the U.S., and I thought of this thread. I do not mean it to pick on England or anyone else because it is crystal clear that this could be any of the countries like England, to include ours. However, our gangs are much more violent, committing heinous murders constantly. \n \n   Gangs of New Britain \nManchester\n Organised crime is run by the Noonan family of north Manchester. Dessie Noonan, murdered last year, once boasted: \"No one dare touch us. I\\'ve got a bigger army than the police. I\\'ve got more guns than the police.\" He was said by police to be linked to 25 murders, although Dessie claimed the real figure was 27. His younger brother Dominic, now the gang kingpin, runs his own system of self-styled justice across the city. Known for its brutality and torture, the 14-strong family has made millions, mainly from drugs and money laundering.\n \n Glasgow \n The city\\'s most famous gangster is Tam \"The Licensee\" McGraw. Having started as an armed robber, he is now at the helm of Glasgow\\'s premier crime gang. Again, drugs are its favoured racket. The smaller but equally violent Daniel and Lloyd clans have reputations for being drive-by killers.\n \n Birmingham\n The top gang is the Burger Bar Boys, who specialise in crack cocaine, money and guns. They have terrorised the city for 20 years and take their name from the cafe in which they met. They are led by a shadowy 51-year-old who has close links with London and Manchester gangs. Children as young as 11 are said to have been recruited in the past year and allegedly given guns and grenades. In the past six years gun crime in Birmingham has increased 600 per cent - much of it down to the BBB.\n \n Nottingham\n The Meadows Gang and the St Ann\\'s Clan have been slugging it out for supremacy for years. Even Nottingham\\'s Chief Constable, Steve Green, admits: \"My force is reeling in a long-standing crisis situation.\" In the past year one gun-related injury has been reported every week, including five deaths and 23 serious woundings. The city is infamous for being the first infiltrated by Jamaican Yardies.\n \n Liverpool\n Yet another feud between rival gangs has left three dead and dozens wounded as warring factions battle for control of the city\\'s multi-million pound heroin and crack cocaine trade. Their favoured weapons are machine guns and knives and there has even been one bomb attack on a police station.\n",
