Yes!\n \n The public reaction to a modest (by most standards) and partial exposure of a woman's breast in the act of feeding offspring is often more exagerated and animated than the public reaction to a newstand line-up of the sexy front covers of biker, body building, fashion and sleaze magazines that are predominantly and intentionally provocative.\n \n ...and who in their right mind would want to feed a baby in the toilet?\n \n \n Kudos to your wife for bowing up!emoticon_xhoho",

That's like me asking someone that has fast food take out to go to the bathroom to eat it.\n \n What do you bet, if she had layed the baby on the floor and changed it's diaper, exposing what all God gave it, nobody would have batted an eye.\n \n Kudos to your wife.

You think and speak poorly of them.\n \n \nWhat's wrong with skinny and made up?\n\n \n Not sure. And this is coming from a broad with some weight to lose.

   "Sounds like you have managed to people your life with some pretty nasty women then. For I am not like this, nor are the women I know. Don't go insulting people just because you have made bad choices about the women in your life.\n\n \n Hahaha my point exactly..... there is no such thing as a bad choice, if you admit you have made a bad choice or regret something you did in your life then you know nothing about life. You stand behind all the choices you make and you learn from your experiences. You assuming because you are a woman and the world treats you differently rather than if you were a man that when I say \"most Americans are stupid\" you assumed I was talking only about women or something crazy along those lines (and yes I did call you crazy again). In reality most Americans means men, woman, and children, it is not raciest against color, gender, or age. Americans are stupid that is the fact of the matter. So one could only assume if this woman is STUPID enough to complain about something that is in no way causing her harm or proving she (the feeder) has broken any laws of ANY type, and actually complain to a flight attendant about it without really taking a second to think about what she is doing then yes SHE is a STUPID American without a doubt. STOP twisting my words into making me into a woman hater, if the complainer was a guy I'd be saying the exact say things about him.\n \n \n \n \n \nSo wanting to be attractive and healthy is a character flaw?\n\n \n The dress size in Hollywood is 0 or -2 that is sickening to me. I'm glad I don't have daughter would would look at pictures of that XXXX and think to herself she has to look just like that. Weak minded people make me sick. So to answer you with the way HEALTHY is looked at nowadays yes it's a character flaw a BIG one at that!\n \n \n \nAnd HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THIS? There is little chance you could know more than a handful intimately and there are millions of us.\n\n \n Babe look as we all know there are ONLY so many different personalities people can have, yes we are all different but for the most part people think in the same way..... as they are told how to think and respond from day one at school. Meaning once you have seen enough of the personalities you could only assume that yeah some maybe a bit different but from what I have had experienced with for the most part you wouldn't find too much different. People are born unique and then morals, values, and sameness are pushed onto them, and they can either accept it or be looked at like they are different and do not belong or they seem to be crazy.\n \n \n \n \nAnd to reinforce what I said - you know some petty women.\n\n \n Correct only you worded it wrong hun. I KNEW some petty woman. Once I saw how weak minded they were I moved on to find something better. That's what's all about always making forward progress in life. \n \n \n \n \nI am all the way smart. I am old and educated. And I am pretty sure you do not want to go a round of battle of the wits with me. I love my girlfriends - but I will happily shred you.\n\n \n I'd be more than happy to battle wits with you. I don't think you are better than me in anyway, nor should you think I'm better than you in anyway. This is what makes America what it is, people being unafraid of standing up for an idea or what they think is right. Watch your wording I don't take to friendly to being shredded. This of course is a non violent conversation of wits correct? Starting to use violence in your argument isn't a good way of showing how smart you are.\n \n \n \n \nYou need to explore it (the world) more.\n\n \n \n Your right I do and I will. You too need to explore it and find out the Nation is VERY blind and bliss to real world problems and the stupidity is overwhelming.\n \n \n \n \nNot until you apologize for insulting my sisters.\n \n \n \n Again you show your personal agenda and attack on me. I SAID MOST AMERICANS ARE STUPID meaning males, females and children. I insulted EVERYONE and I will not apologize until our people set our government straight. However you do owe me a apology for slandering me as a person whose females companions need to be felt sorry for. That is a personal attack with no factual backup information.\n \n \nReally? The fact that the snitty women you know bitch about each other is \"facts\"?\n\n \n The facts are Americans are stupid, this is how stupid Americans act (the woman who complained on the airplane).\n \n \n \n \nI don't care how you treat women. You think and speak poorly of them.\n\n \n Again correct but your wording is wrong. You don't care how I treat stupid people. I do speak poorly of them and until they prove otherwise I will continue to show people how dumb they are for allowing our government to run wild while our eyes are closed or while we are watching American Idol.",

It is simply courteous to find a less conspicuous location.\n \n Why would that be so outrageous if I did ask them to please cover up (were they able to)? Some things are not appropriate. Would you think it so horrible if that mother of 3 asked scantily clad women to cover themselves?\n\n \n I don't see any problem with exercising a little discretion when breastfeeding in public. On the other hand, if a woman's an exhibitionist and has no regard for others, I see no problem with comments such as \"get a load of the size of that areolae!\" or \"Does it hurt when you fold that thing over like that?\" ;)",

Mom has a good time, and, a happier, more content, healthier baby. Tie the baby to you while you do other activities. If they're old enough, pop 'em in a bouncer, while you do other chores.

Don't buy that specialty junk they're peddling, you're fussing with, you're uncomfortable in, baby can't use it themselves, and you paying lots more, as well. There ARE easier routes. Buy cool, cheap, and practical. You will lead the way into new nursing fashions for the inconspicuous corners of Starbucks and the more public park benches that people stroll past.

   "Opposition to public breastfeeding is just one more example of the pointless and counterproductive pseudo-moralistic precepts cooked up by the middle class in an effort to distance themselves from the working class. Breastfeeding is better for a child in so many ways it's not even funny. We ought to be applauding the women who make the time, effort and personal sacrifice - both in short-term pain and long-term likelihood of droopage - to breastfeed. Their children will tend to be healthier and happier, and less prone to obesity. \n \n Breastfeeding a child is difficult. If nothing else, it absolutely shackles the mother to the child 24 hours a day for anything up to a year. By the time you factor in all the faffing about that surrounds the event itself, a mother is lucky if she can get two hours together to accomplish anything, including sleep. Sure, she can express into a bottle and let the father or a relative feed the baby that way - if she can manage to find a time when her tits aren't bone dry or being suckled.\n \n What she doesn't need, when she sits, exhausted and frazzled in the most inconspicuous corner of Starbucks, wearing the unfashionable and expensive nursing top and uncomfortable and expensive nursing bra she's bought purely so that others won't have to suffer a glimpse of her upper torso, is some priggish, selfish, inconsiderate rectum telling her she should be feeding her child while squatting over a public toilet so that he/she doesn't have to bother rotating his eyeballs away from the 5 degree field of view she occupies.\n\n \n Bravo. Might as well close the thread right there.",
