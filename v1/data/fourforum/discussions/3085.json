   "I recently read a book \"Germs, Guns and Steel\" that rationalized the spread and recent dominance of European (white) society was due to the status of Europeans in regards to germs (they had been exposed to the most/worst of them), guns (most native people had no knowledge of them), and steel (superior metalurgy - sp?).

That was what I was writing about. It is only because of distribution of domesticatible plants and animals AND the effects of European living conditions (compact communties = disease = resistance to disease) on their ability to survive.\n \n My whole point was I hadn't realized HOW Europeans came to have these advantages. This book explains a lot. The author also demonstrates that race, by itself, is not a factor in the success or failure of a people.\n \n Incedentally, (sp?) did you enjoy the book? How did you come to read it?\n \n Regards",

   "I strongly suspect that it has more to do with the Anglo-saxon structure of society than with desease resistence. First, by that thesis Africa should have leapt ahead. Second, with the exception of the Americas, Europe was depopulated at least as badly as Asia and far worse than Africa during the Black Plague. A third of the population died in the years followed 1381. More importantly, the leap forward by the Europeans took place during the last 500 years...prior to that one could profitably argue that Islam and China were industrially and intellectually well ahead of Europe. But the industrial revolution was built upon its precursor civilization, which had evolved from a certain ethos not found in the east or anywhere else. It is reductionist to call this the \"protestant work ethic\" or similar catch phrases, but the spirit of enquiry spawned by the reformation and later enlightenment were unmatched anywhere else. And those phenomenon didn't just happen to take place...they were the progeny of much earlier foundations unique to Europe.\n \n Of course it has nothing to do with \"race\". Or maybe it does.",

It is the european warlike past and the technological advances that were caused by the same military needs that caused \" white\" people to be so sucessfull.\n\n \n I agree that China and India (and Southeast Asia and parts of Africa (north) and much of the rest of the world) were more advanced than Europe, and up until approximately the dates you mention (excluding the \"Europe\" of Bysantine).\n \n The problem is that Europe's past is no more warlike than anyone else, and in particular India and China. India has been episodically rocked by Imperial ambitions since Alexander and arguably before that. A very long line of successive invaders and domestic wars makes the tribal skirmishes of England and France, for example, look like a barn dance. It is fashionable to assign causality for Europe's leap forward to weapons, and weapons to a surfeit of war, but it doesn't hold up under scrutiny. The leap forward had much to do with non warlike invention, and the fact that they were later used to make war more effectively doesn't mean that war impelled Europe forward.\n \n I think it is much bigger than that. A society must be able to support, intellectually and by moray, a leap forward of the magnitude of Europe's. No other civilization, given the identical arms, could have possibly embarked upon colonization for example. It is not merely an accident of technology or war that Europe leapt ahead...it is the social structure built by the Anglo-Saxons that allowed it and decreed it.",

China was on the perpetual warpath with both internal and external foes. On top of that it was invaded from the north, and at constant war with its southeast neighbours. \"India\" didn't exist as an entity until after 1857, and until then was a collection of petty kingdoms, satrapies and decaying empires, with one short 300 year exception of the Moghul Empire, and even THAT didn't encompass all of the landmass. \"India\" was at constant and unending war with itself. There was no \"India\".\n \n In any event the leap forward by Europe happened after it was at relative peace...during the industrial revolution. Weapons didn't drive the industrial revolution, the industrial revolution drove weapons development if anything. You may find this hard to believe, but the Moghuls and even the Rajputs of India had better cannon than their contemporaries in Europe at the time. It was only later that repeater rifles and the maxim gun rendered Europe invincible to non Europeans (except for the Russians who apparently should stay away from boats and ships).",

   "Whites are successful because of a combination of environment and genetics. Books such as The Bell Curve, Race, Evolution, and Behavior: A Life History Perspective (3rd Edition), The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability, IQ and the Wealth of Nations, and Race: The Reality of Human Differences show a hierarchy in cognitive abilities between ethnic groups. Generally, ethnic average IQ scores is as follows: Jews: 117, East Asians: 108, Whites: 100, Hispanics: 89, and Blacks: 70 (borderline retardation). With respect to Whites though, a very small percentage of them tend to be very creative and this is why most inventions come from Whites. \n \n Here is an interesting review of Jared Diamond's book:\n \n Reviewed by Matt Nuenke:\n \n Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond is one of those books by the racial egalitarians that tries to disprove theories that do not exist in the first place. Diamond wants to show that Western dominance and technological advancement was not a matter of a higher intellect but was due to environmental and historical circumstances. The problem is, I am not aware of any advocates who try to make the argument that because Western culture is more advanced, they are therefore the smartest. In fact, quite the opposite is true. Psychometricians have shown that East Asians are more intelligent than Caucasians, and that they do not lead us technologically (outside Japan) because of environmental or political/cultural differences. So Diamond has written a book to disprove a theory that does not exist. He is attacking a straw man.\n \n What he is really doing however is attacking Western culture, for no other reason than he finds it distasteful because of his hatred for the existing power structure based on his egalitarian desire to reshape politics. For this reason, this book is filled with a history of how plants and animals were domesticated, how germs became prevalent at the dawn of modern civilizations, and how advanced societies use weapons to suppress conquered peoples. The detailed analysis of these issues tends to be too long, and will be of limited interest to most people. But he does go to great lengths to show how only Eurasia could have developed in the way it did, and that other parts of the world just did not have the proper environment for modern development. I don't take issue with his arguments. In many ways they are \"just so\" stories that I found credible but of little real interest when it comes to judging the worth of people, which he seems to be trying to do in this book. But one must wonder how such a mundane book, with so much speculation and so little impact on the real world, managed to get the Pullitzer Prize? And of course the reason is simple. This is another book by a Marxist with a universalist agenda.[0] It is the same genre as Gould's The Mismeasure of Man, et al. It serves the political interests of those who review, publish and promote authors who are radical environmentalists.\n \n [ . . . ]\n \n Complete article is at http://home.comcast.net/~neoeugenics/Guns.htm\n \n Regards.",

   "Advances in society have nothing to do with race. It's just the luck of the draw. If somewhere someone comes up with a new form of technology, usually the advance will stay within that society. Because people tend to think they're always right, they don't usually adopt the customs and technology of other civilisations without being able to claim it as their own. Besides, people think that they can get further in life by stepping on other people. Look at the Native Americans. The Europeans came over, called themselves Americans, then killed off the Native Americans, all the while calling them \"Indians\" out of stupidity.
