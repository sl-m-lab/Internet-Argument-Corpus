   "I agree it should be legal, but well-regulated by the government. Legalizing it would benefit the women who do it. In Nevada, the women are required by law to undergo regular STD tests. The last time a legal prostitute had AIDS in Nevada was 1985. The police keep a close watch on legal brothels in Nevada. If a brothel gets caught hiring a 17 year girl, the whole brothel will be shut down. A person must have a very clean record to open a brothel in the first place. An illegal prostitute has to worry about being beaten or even murdered by a sadistic customer. In Nevada, the legal brothels have intercom systems so that prostitutes can yell for help. I also think it's a waste of police resources to focus so much on arresting prostitutes. The prostitutes are back on the street as soon as they are released. Ann Landers favored legalizing prostitution.\n http://www.s-t.com/daily/08-99/08-13-99/zzzadlan.htm",

Sure, condoms and other forms of birth control should be required, but condoms break and most forms of birth-control aren't idiot proof.\n \n 3) If it turns legal, taxes will have to be paid.

The majority does it because they NEED money, not because it pays good money.\n \n 4) Should this be done, it will take an application and whatnot, not to mention the long processes of inspectors and the like. Needless to say, not only will people hate to go through that process, but they will also NOT go through that process. You'll STILL see more illegal hookers than legal.

   "Hi, I'm new, but I'm going to jump right in here. I am a woman, and I am a law enforcement officer as well. \n A few misnomers about prostitution. First, whiole despite the multitude of movies about the romantic side of prostitution that elude to a white knight riding in and sweeping her away, it's an illusion. The reality while being cold and hard is that most prostitutes do it for money for drugs. They have already sold every single thing they own and have nothing but themselves to sell, so they do. \n Prostitution is not a wonderful occupation. While it was stated that the women could be self employed, the reailty is quite simply that most prostitutes are battered regularly. They are quite simply, naked and at the mercy of whichever John picked them up at the time, thus making them easy pickings for crime (murder/rape/battery/assault). The Johns do whatever they will with them, and since the prostitute is usually strung out to high heaven waiting for the next fix anyway there is little they can do to respond. It happens, that's fact. \n Legalizing prostitution quite simply is more than a morality issue. It's a safety issue. Consider the fact that a woman may pick and choose who she sees/dates/has sex with and yes there are gold diggers that do it simply for money, however they have a choice. One any particular day they can choose to leave whatever guy they are leeching from and move on with their spoils. Are they scummy for doing it? Yes. But they have a choice. A prostitute has none. They simply have nothing so to feed themselves, get through today they perform like a trained seal, give up what little self respect they have left and spread for whatever John shows up with cash. They lose the choice, and I know someone will say they will be able to choose, they are self employed, they can do what they want, but the reality is that if you depend on selling your body for rent (if they even have a place to live) food, and clothes you can't really take a day off, because you NEED to continue to make money in order to sustain these things. One again the cycle puts you back at the mercy of whatever John you get, naked, unarmed and alone. \n Prostitution is legal in some areas of the US. Look into the crime statistics. You'll find that the same crimes against prostitutes occur at the same frequency, and for the same reasons as in the areas it is illegal. \n I feel badly for prostitutes. They are truly at the end of their rope, and many are nice women who turned down the wrong road somewhere and don't know any other way. They have no ability to get health insurance, a car, and sometimes a warm meal. Many are kids who ran away from a nightmare and into one just as bad. Prostitution isn't the romantic profession Hollywood makes it out to be. It's a sad end for too many who have lost everything in the world and have nothing left to sell but their bodies, whether they fell into it because of drugs, or as run aways or simply because they felt there was no other way. Ask a prostitute some day if she'd rather be a secretary or a nurse. I guarantee you her reply is \"Hell yes!\" Not one that I've ever spoken with has enjoyed their profession. Not one, all have been ashamed of it, all feel trapped in a cycle of hell. You can offer them help, and some do turn their lives around and take the step out, but some don't know anything else, and they go right back because they are too afraid to do something else, they have no self respect left to make that change and some just don't even care anymore. \n So all in all I suppose my point is that making prostitution legal isn't going to solve anything, or fix anything. The problem will remain the same, the motivations will remain the same, there will just be more of it, because now that it's legal more will turn to it as a viable option.",

   "Actually Greyhawk, You are wrong about what many prostitutes are like. They are not all in it for money to spend on drugs. And they are not all mistreated and abused. Some actually do it because they enjoy the money, and they enjoy the control they have over men. I have a close friend who started out stripping in a club to make money for college. Her family could not support her in any way, and she was desperate for money. She was introduced to the world of prostitution when she was 20. She began working for an escort service and has worked there for 3 years. She started out not doing anything sexual, but then as time went on, the other girls \"showed her the ropes\" and told her the best ways to get the most money out of the men. Eventually she gave in and began having sex with them. She doesn't LOVE her job, but she isn't miserable. She doesn't do drugs, and she isn't trashy. She goes to college and hardly anyone knows what she does. \n \n The other girls at her place of employment are in the same situation. They just needed money, and the money was great. I am not saying that some of them aren't on drugs, I am sure a few of them are, but I just wanted to show that there is an appealing side to this profession for girls who are desperate. \n \n My friend has had one scary incident in the three years she has been doing this. It wasn't bad enough to make her quit.\n \n I feel that if prostitution were legal it would be safer for the women who do choose to do this, and from seeing what goes on firsthand, I know that there are plently of girls who will continue to sell their bodies whether it is legal or not.",

   "The escorts you speak of aren't the norm. The norm quite plainly is the woman or man on the street, the majority being drug addicted. There are thousands upon thousands of them. Drive through any city at night, go to the streets where they hang out and take a look. They aren't hard to spot. You'll see kids 12 years old and up selling themselves. Like I said before there is a romantic notion of prostitution that isn't there in the reality. \n I don't see how it would be safer if it were legal. More widespread, sure, but safer I just don't see. What does the legalization of it do to improve their basic safety? Most due to being picked up can't carry a gun in most states, and they can't even carry OC legally in many as well. \n Again let me reiterate that where prostitution is legal in the US they face the same crime rate and type as the areas where it is not legal. So how would making it nationally legal make it safer? emoticon_confused I'm trying to follow your argument, but I can't see how you make the connection. What thing (the act alone won't do it) will national legalization provide to ensure the safety of prostitutes?",

Explain to me how it'll help with America's STD problem. How will a prostitue be able to live a normal life if she quits her prostitution job? A known prostitute will most likely not be accepted to many job positions. Before someone starts complaining about discrimination or unconstitutional or whatever, would you really want your child's first grade teacher to have been a known prostitute? \n \n Jenny Jones has a lot of kids (sometimes even 7 or 8 year olds) on her show (that show is true entertainment, especially when you're feeling depressed) who want to become prostitues when they get older. Some even do it at their current age. Truly sad. I think we should educate people about the dangers of becoming a prostitute instead of letting them come up with ideas like \"I get to have sex and get paid for it, I want that job.\" People don't know what they're getting into these days.",

Prostitutes also gain some control over their health and safety with the right to insist that customers use condoms.

Legalizing it would bring prostitution off the streets, out of shady hotels, and into safer, more easily controlled spaces. \n \n Legalization allows for government monitoring and regulation of the sex trade, something that is practically impossible now. Supply and demand can be more easily assessed.\n \n \n Here is a great comment about legalizing prostitution that I found on the internet:\n \n There are many activities people will partake in regardless of whether they are legal or safe. Government should acknowledge that people will drink, smoke various substances, get abortions, and visit prostitutes no matter what. Rather than stigmatizing these activities and sending them underground by outlawing them, governments should recognize their continued existence and attempt to make them as safe as possible. The costs, in both financial and human terms, are ultimately much lower when risky behavior is legal and regulated. Legalization does not equal endorsement.

   "\n Grayhawk-- It would be safer because women would be guaranteed safer working conditions. \n\n \n How would legalization provide this? How can you guarantee someone that works from home has safe working conditions? OSHA doesn't make spot checks on home offices now, and they would not do so if prostitution were to become legal. \n \n\n Prostitutes also gain some control over their health and safety with the right to insist that customers use condoms. \n\n \n They have the right to do so now. Legalization does not provide the right to do anything more than sell sex. It does not guarantee them any more rights other than the right to sell sex. \n \n \n\n Since many laws provide for health inspections, the spread of disease is minimized. \n \n \n How? Health inspections are required now in many areas, and signs are posted on buildings that state such areas are known to be high infection rates of HIV. Legalization does not force medical checks on prostitutes, as a person's medical history cannot effect their employment in any way. (ie HIV positive dentists)\n \n\n Legalizing it would bring prostitution off the streets, out of shady hotels, and into safer, more easily controlled spaces. \n\n \n I disagree. Legalization doesn't move the prostitues, it simply guarantees that they cannot be arrested for the act. They aren't going to sudden come into a cash flow that moves them from the inner city back alleys to a penthouse. The price isn't going to go up, actually they'd be making less since now they'd need to pay taxes on it. \n \n\n Legalization allows for government monitoring and regulation of the sex trade, something that is practically impossible now. Supply and demand can be more easily assessed.\n\n That's if they report it, keep in mind they'd have to first apply for the EIN, then follow through by paying the taxes on that sex trade. Many of these people don't even have a permanent address, so that's nearly impossible. \n \n \nRather than stigmatizing these activities and sending them underground by outlawing them, governments should recognize their continued existence and attempt to make them as safe as possible. The costs, in both financial and human terms, are ultimately much lower when risky behavior is legal and regulated. Legalization does not equal endorsement. The government is not condoning pot, prostitution, or abortion by legalizing them--it is recognizing that it cannot stop people from getting high or paying for sex, so it might as well make doing so safe. \n \n \n Once again I ask how it is possible that the mere act of legalization makes it a safe act. It doesn't. It can't. Where and how can you afford a person safety in a work enviroment that is uncontrolled, such as the back of a car, a random hotel room, or even a back alley? Do you then afford prostitutes more rights than the average American by considering any crime committed against them would serve a more severe sentence? Do you guarantee their safety by forcing others to forgo their rights and force medical tests on Johns which will be made public with the prostitutes? \n In the ideal world I imagine you could make it safer, but the ideal isn't reality. The hard cold reality is you cannot guarantee protection for all of any one group. There is no cop in every living room affording round the clock safety to each and every home. If there were we would not have the rights we do as we would be a police state. You cannot support the legalization of one act by removing rights from others if you wish to keep your own freedoms intact.",

   "Ok, the idea of making it legal in brothels could in fact provide a bit more in the way of safety. This is what I was looking for when I asked for examples. The idea that they would be in a place where security could be provided for them would improve their personal safety, I agree. The brothel would be run as a business and each prostitute would be an employee. I now see what you are trying to say as far as this goes. \n As far as streetwalking still being illegal, perhaps you see my point as well. \n My counter to the idea of the brothel itself is that the prostitute then becomes a commodity, for the use of the madame/pimp and does not have any personal control over their enviroment, which is what you've been advocating for them all along. As far as disease and the spread of disease goes it would not improve their situtation, because once again you can't regulate that constitutionally. So while it would provide the physical security of not being raped, battered, or murdered, or at least affording some protection from it, it does not provide any more than that. Like I said, the same crimes that are occuring in the areas where it is currently legal are occuring where it is illegal, and where it is legal the brothels already exist. \n Other than this, is there something you can demonstrate that would afford them safety and security by making it legal?",

   "I don`t think legislation will do much to combat the exploitation of marginalised and desperate women.\n\n I disagree. I think that most areas with legalised prostitution only do it within a brothel system. Where they are looked after by the management and protected against both abusive and exploitative clients and pimps. It also places them in a place where the turning to drugs would be noticed and dealt with, not just ignored.\n \n \nI`m pretty confident that most prostitution is done with contraceptives, regardless if its legal or not.\n\n I'm sure it is, but still it can't hurt to have regulations.\n \n \nSTD checks may or may not decrease or increase STD spread. As far as I know, prostitues are allready given free STD checks and are encouraged by the social authoritees to do this regurally.\n But what about clients visiting the prostitutes. Legalising means that they are ensured safety as well, hence reducing the STD spread.\n \n \n \nMaking prostitution legal would of course increase \"consumption\" of prostitutes, increasing the risk of spreading STD`s by increasing the actual amount of visits.\n I'm not sure how dramatic this increase would be. And feel it would be combated by my previous comments on STD checks.\n \n \n \nBut the problem is that you would not realy protect those who currently are prostituting themselves. You would only compete most of them out of bussiness and replace them with other prostitutes. The majority of current prostitutes would turn to some other lucrative bussiness so that they could finance their substance abuse.\n I take your point on this. I would think however a much higher proportion than you claim would go legal if they have the option however. They gain significant protection and advantages. And it also protects the customer as well.\n \n \n [quote]You say you want to protect the criminals.

   "Oh, and about prohibition\n \n While the prohibition argument seems very convincing at first glance, it doesn`t really hold if you take a closer look. The prohibition of alcohol was prohibition of producing, selling and bartering a certain good; alcohol. Now, the properties of the good alcohol where quite specific. It was generally used by a large portion of the american public, it was socialy accepted and there was little to none legal substitution for that particular good (only other forms of illegal drugs could really be seen as a substitute good). It was these properties that caused the large black market on alcohol, which in turn led to a gateway for organised crime. This is what makes prohibition on goods like drugs different from goods like alcohol (although, this is quite country specific, and I could be wrong about the american drug culture). But the problem with making a comparisson between prohibition of alcohol and prohibition of prostitution goes even further. Prostitution is not a good. It is an act. The good is sex, and this is not prohibited. What is prohibited is the act of trading sex for money. Prohibiting prostitution should rather be seen as a regulation on sex than actual prohibition of a good.",
