Obviously you'll come to your own conclusion, but a lot of their \"justification\" comes from a desire to enforce their version of \"morality\" or they insist that \"popular vote\" decide issues of homosexual law (and the constitution can be ignored) or an insistence that gays prove why they should have these rights or quoting false science or ... < insert a thousand and one excuses here <\n \n But with regards to your question, the last two are typically the mentality that attempts to counter it.

Actually, perhaps it's heterosexual marriage that leads to \"other\" types of marriages? \n \n http://web.XXXXXX.org/article.jsp?sectionid=8&id=6111\n \n Heterosexual marriage leads to interspecies marriage. No, really. I'm serious.\n Posted by amused Striking Scorpion on Apr. 01, 2005.\n 23 comments from readers. Join the discussion!\n \n Boycott Kansas!\n \n Kansas has decided that it's cute and amusing to attack gay people and their families. As long as they maintain this attitude, I'm boycotting Kansas. I invite you to join me. I'm seeing a pattern here.\n \n Let's start with the premise of the guy's point. Gay marriage = slippery slope leading to interspecies marriage. We'll throw logic out the window now, and not mention how consent is required for marriage in this country, and dogs cannot give concrete consent, instead examining the truth of this gay marriage slippery slope business.\n \n \"A year ago in India, a woman married her dog,\" Jim Welker, a Republican from Loveland, CO tells us. The Indians DO marry dogs. It matters not that it's a symbolic marriage. Mr. Welker's statement was disingenuous, but not dishonest.\n \n BUT (this is kind of a big one, nearly on target with Jerry Falwell's) how do the Indians feel about gay marriage? After all, that is the basis for Mr. Welker's position. Gay marriage will lead to interspecies marriage. Thus, gay marriage MUST come first.\n \n Uh oh. Turns out India doesn't like gay marriage. They don't even like GAYS. Sodomy still carries a sentence of up to ten years.\n \n So gay marriage is illegal in India, but they still marry animals. However, heterosexual marriage is very legal in India. Thus, I propose that heterosexual marriage leads to interspecies marriage. Since other species cannot communicate their implicit consent to marriage, I move that we ban heterosexual marriage.\n \n Wait, there is one other example provided us. Mr. Welker also says that \"a few years ago\" a man tried to marry his horse, in Boulder. This, too, is true. But, all jokes about Boulderites aside, gay marriage has not occurred there since a brief stint in the seventies.\n \n Turns out \"a few years\" in Mr. Welker's mind is actually a few decades in reality.. And that the man in question applied for a marriage license so that he could insert \"a mark of sanity in a world where apparently madness was viewed as rational behavior.\" In other words, he applied for a marriage license for himself and his horse in an effort to protest gay marriage.\n \n Taking this situation on its own, I must propose that raging, homophobic straight men are the cause of interspecies marriage. In accordance with my statement above (since other species cannot communicate their implicit consent to marriage), I must move that homophobia and straight men be banned.\n \n Now I must contact Marilyn Musgrave and Wayne Allard for assistance in drafting the legal ban of heterosexual marriage, homophobia, and heterosexual men.",

So unless we start forcing life insurance companies to sell policies on all husbands/wives regardless of species, I don't see a problem. Marriage is just a word, churches can deny marriage to dogs just as they can to gays. Of course I still agree that marriage has no place in the government. It is actually unconstitutional if I interpret the Constitution correctly. Who can find the power to marry people granted in the Constitution? So it's a state issue and thus can't any state make laws to recognize polygamy or marrying dogs if they want? I just think this argument is silly that gay marriage will lead to marrying dogs.

If you are willing to support everything that doesn't instantly and directly affect someone than I will give you an answer to your question :)\n\n And here we go with the incessant and irrelevant analogies again.\n Polygamy? There is a long list of legal complications which must be worked out before \"polygamy\" could ever be thought to be reality.\n If a man marries two women, and one divorces him, can the divorcee sue the still existing wife for alimony?\n And in addition, it's linked to a variety of other things too. There are polygamous groups (I believe in Utah) which routinely toss out their male children from the group. Abandoning them due to the simple math of male-based polygamy. One man marrying three women will typically work in a society that has a 1:3 ratio of men to women. When the ratio is closer to 1:1, the society can choose to force that ratio into being.\n One of the things which I find interesting is that the Old Testament is full of examples of polygamy. God never condemned it. Not even in the New Testament. But Christians see it as a moral imperative from the Bible... ???\n \n Bestiality is all about the lack of consent. An animal cannot consent to sex.\n \n \n \nThe government is the one that created this right...You would think it would be changed by the same democratic process. Nevertheless, a good question...I'm not sure having marriage in government is really helping anything...it surely isn't preserving what's left of \"sacred marriage\"\n\n I explained above why the government got involved in marriage.\n It's not surprising that today it is still being used as a tool of discrimination.\n \n And for the record, the government's involvement is not supposed to \"help\" marriage. That's not the purpose of the government's involvement.\n The government's involvement is to help provide a civilized society where rights are PROTECTED and INALIENABLE.\n \n \n \nWhy does it have to be life-committed that receives these \"rights\"?

   "This whole thread just further incenses me on the concept of marriage in the gov't. Divorce laws, \"suing\" for alimony-what does that have to do with love?

   "\"Same-Sex Marriage Undermines Traditional Marriage: The Netherlands is Proof \" \n One of the most vocal advocates against Same-Sex Marriage has been Stanley Kurtz, a research fellow with the Hoover Institute and a contributing editor for The National Review. In a series of articles which focus on Same-Sex Marriage in Europe, Kurtz argues that Same-Sex Marriage has undermined traditional marriage in the Netherlands in four ways: \n \n The legalization of Same-Sex Marriage, as well as movements advocating Same-Sex Marriage, deteriorates the connection between marriage and parenthood (3)\n \n The push for Same-Sex Marriage rights has led to a drastic increase in the percentage of out-of-wedlock births in the Netherlands, which have almost doubled since the mid-1990s to 31% (see Diagram A) (4)\n \n More Dutch parents are choosing cohabitation over marriage, and the world as a whole is seeing a vast decrease in the number of marriages taking place (5)\n \n Cohabitation and the distinction between marriage and parenthood not only undermine traditional marriage, but also have negative impacts on children because \"cohabiting parents are 2-3 times more likely to break up than married parents\" (6) \n Simply put, according to Kurtz, the struggle for marital rights in the Netherlands has led to increased rates of cohabitation, increased rates of out-of-wedlock births, and an overall devaluation of traditional marriage. If the United States allows Same-Sex Marriages, we can expect to see the same problems occur. \n \n Compelling as his argument may be, many of Kurtz's claims are refuted by statistical data from the Netherlands and the rest of Europe, particularly found in studies by Dr. M. V. Lee Badgett, Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Namely: \n \n Although the marriage rate in the Netherlands has declined recently, it would be a mistake to attribute the decrease to Same-Sex Marriage. In fact, \"with a few exceptions, marriage rates have decreased\" from 1980 to 2001 throughout Europe, the United States and Canada. (7) Because those decreases are occurring in countries that allow Same-Sex Marriage as well as ones that do not, it is impossible to attribute the decline to Same-Sex Marriage. Studies have concluded this overall decrease may be due to increasing economic inequalities between men and women, (8) Some attribute the Dutch decrease to an overall increase in the average age of the Dutch population, (9) and Dutch demographers also believe the decrease is largely due to poor economics within the state. Regardless of the cause, it is evident that \"heterosexual couples in those countries were clearly not deterred from marrying by the legalization of same-sex couples' rights\" (see Chart 1 in Badgett's paper). (10)\n \n Divorce rates have not been adversely effected by the extension of Same-Sex Marriage rights (see Chart 2 in Badgett's paper) (11)\n \n Although cohabitation rates have increased in the Netherlands, it would be incorrect to claim the increase came as a result of Same-Sex Marriage rights. The sharp increase Kurtz describes came about long before Same-Sex Marriage rights were granted, meaning \"high cohabitation rates came first, gay partnership laws followed,\" not the other way around (12)\n \n The Netherlands is not the only European country that is experiencing soaring out-of-wedlock birthrates: \"the same rapid rise in nonmarital births that we see in the Netherlands in the 1990s also occurred in other European countries that initially had low nonmarital birth rates. Nonmarital births have soared in Ireland, Luxembourg, Hungary, Lithuania, and several other eastern European countries--all countries that do not allow same-sex couples to marry or register\" (13) \n If Kurtz hinges his conclusion that traditional marriages are being undermined in the Netherlands on the basis that out-of-wedlock births and cohabitation rights are on the rise, he is ignoring the trends across the European continent with respect to these statistics. It is clear that if Same-Sex Marriage has had any impact on traditional marriage, it has not been a negative one. \n \n Additionally, the United States need not fear the impacts to traditional marriage Kurtz believes will occur. If Kurtz is correct, the deteriorating of the institution of marriage occurs simply with the existence of Same-Sex rights movements. If this were the case, we would expect to see all the impacts Kurtz describes -- a decrease in the rate of marriage, increases in out-of-wedlock births, and increases in rates of cohabitation -- to have occurred already in a society where the gay and lesbian rights movement has been highly active. This, however, has not been the case. \n \n Although there has been a decrease in the rate of marriage, it has been for the economic and social reasons that have already been explored. The growth of the rate of out-of-wedlock births in the United States, contrary to what Kurtz would have us believe, has actually decreased substantially since the mid-1990s (see Diagram B). (14) \n \n Finally, the social atmosphere surrounding marriage is quite different in the United States than it is in any other country. Within the United States, \"couples have many more tangible incentives to marry [.] In the United States, unlike Scandinavia, marriage is often the only route to survivor coverage in pensions and social security, and many people have access to health care only through their spouse's employment.\" (15) Same-Sex Marriages, then, will not have the disastrous effect on traditional marriages, in the United States or otherwise, that Kurtz describes.\n \n http://www.europebyphoto.com/gay-marriage/ssmrgundermines.html",

He says, where did I say gay marriage would lead to other types of marriages? \n Yet at the time my answer was truthful. Whether I said it afterwards is irrelevant. For the record though... I said a certain logic leads to the polygamy.\n \n \n\n I showed that in places where polygamy is legal, the only other type of marriage that is legal is heterosexual marriage. Does this mean that heterosexual marriage leads to polygamy. \n One reason polygamy would not become legal is due to jealousy.\n The line of reasoning is what leads to the idea that polygamy or beastiality would be ok.\n \n \nNo, disgusting is not another. You seem to be unaware of this, but we already have a system set up here for deciding what's illegal. You don't just get to make things up as you go along. If something is unsanitary, if it could cause a public health problem, than it can be made illegal. Thus, no craping in the street. But we don't make things illegal just because some people find them icky, because that would let people just to the silly conclusion you leapt to.\n Sure we do. Things we find \"obscene\" are often made illegal.

A marriage is much easier when you have one person in charge. One boss.\n When you have two people as equals, you have to compromise.

   "wow, personal freedom contributed to gay marriage, higher divorce rates, children out of wedlock, and a sexual revolution? Why didn't all this happen during the American Revolution? Freeing the slaves (in the US at least)? Nope, the \"obsession\" with personal freedom is natural in people. We don't like dictatorships, we like Democracy. We don't like Big Brother telling us what to do. If we want to get divorced, that's no one else's problem. If we want to have kids out of wedlock? Why the hell do you care? If I do it in the middle of the street, then you have cause for concern, but whatever I do in the privacy of my own home and in my life, is none of your business even if it contributes to stats that look bad. Personal freedom is not the problem, it's the answer. I would guess with the lower divorce rates there were a lot more unhappy couples who hated each other yet stayed together because of \"morals\".
